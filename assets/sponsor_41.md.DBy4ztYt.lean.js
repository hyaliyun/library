The name dates far back into antiquity; it was Pedeme to the Meroitic inhabitants, and Primis to the Romans. The site has a long history of occupation, ranging from as early as the eighth century BCE to 1813 CE, and was an economic, political, and religious center. Originally it was a major city perched on a cliff above the Nile, but the flooding of Lake Nasser after the construction of the Aswan High Dam transformed it into an island and flooded its outskirts. Qasr Ibrim is the only major archaeological site in Lower Nubia to have survived the Nile floods. Both prior to and after the Nile floods, it has remained a major site for archaeological investigations. History Human habitation at the site dates from the Late Period of ancient Egypt, but it reached its greatest prominence in the Middle Ages, when the area was the home of the Eparch of Nobatia. Qasr Ibrim is the source of the largest collection of Old Nubian documents ever found, including the records of the Eparch. The site was occupied until 1813, when the last occupants were driven out by artillery fire. Today the island is closed to all but archaeologists. Qasr Ibrim in 2008 =Egyptian influence= Egypt's influence in Nubia began around 2,000 BCE, when Egyptian invaded and claimed sovereignty over the area. Many Egyptian artifacts and evidence of Egyptian architecture have been found at Qasr Ibrim. The earliest inscription at the site is a stela, a stone or wooden slab, from the reign of Amenhotep I. The stela was found in a now-ruined Christian Byzantine cathedral at Qasr Ibrim where it had been reused in one of the church's crypts. The stela is now located in the British Museum. Sandstone Stela Dated to Year 8 of Pharaoh Amenhotep I (~1530 BCE, 18th Dynasty, from Qasr Ibrim) - British Museum = Roman occupation= The site was partly rebuilt \\"under the prefecture of Gaius Petronius during Augustus' reign.\\" Qasr Ibrim played a key role in Rome's defense of the Aswan region, and was likely held until 100 CE or later. The fortress, constructed by Roman military engineers, was the strongest in the Nile Valley at this time. = A center of Christianity= Stela of Georgios, bishop of Ibrim, 10th to 11th century CE, currently housed in the Petrie Museum During Roman times the town was one of the last bastions of paganism, its six temples converting to Christianity two centuries later than the rest of Egypt. It then became one of the main Christian centers in Lower Nubia. Christianity first came to Qasr Ibrim in the 6th century, but had little effect. It wasn't until the city became part of the kingdom of Makuria, in the early 8th century, that Qasr Ibrim became a center for Christianity. This continued even through the fifteenth century when the Makurian kingdom became Islamic. The city held out against Islam until the 16th century, when a unit of Bosnian soldiers, part of the Ottoman army, occupied the site. The Bosnian soldiers stayed on and eventually married into the local Nubian community, using part of the cathedral as a mosque. Two churches remain on the site. The Taharqa Church was most likely built between 542-580 CE, this would make it one of Nubia's earliest churches. Like many of the first churches in Nubia, it would have been constructed within the walls of the already present temples. Qasr Ibrim's cathedral was built later, though the date of construction in unclear. Archaeologists currently believe it was constructed in the first half of the eighth century. Island of Qasr Ibrim in the Lake Nasser, Egypt Archaeology The site was first excavated by David Randall-MacIver and C. Leonard Woolley for the Eckley B. Coxe Expedition for the University of Pennsylvania in 1911. In 1963, excavations were started by the Egyptian Exploration Society and have continued periodically to the present day. Cemeteries found east and west of the main settlement were excavated in 1932 and 1961. There are still areas around the complex that have yet to be excavated, although some sites, including those near the river, were destroyed in floods caused by the Aswan Dam. =Evidence for plant and animal use= The almost rainless conditions of the area have created excellent preservation of organic materials. Pottery dated to the post-Meroitic period (350-600 CE) shows evidence of both date palm and doum palm residues. Various samples of sorghum dating from between 800 BCE to 1800 CE have also been found at Qasr Ibrim. There are four forms of sorghum that are found on the site. From when the site was settled until around 100 CE only wild sorghum can be found. From 100 CE until around 1500 CE an early form of cultivated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, ssp. bicolor, race Bicolor) is found. Around 1200 CE an advanced form of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, ssp. bicolor, race Durra) appears. Between the 5th and 7th centuries CE a transitional race is also present. There are believed to be three phases of agricultural history, the Napatan occupation, the Roman occupation, and the Meroitic periods. Listed below are the main crops that have been identified in each phase: Napatan (mid 8th-mid 7th century BCE): *emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) *hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) *broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) *flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) Roman (25 BCE-mid 1st century CE): *emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) *hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) *broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) *flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) *cotton (Gossypium sp.) Meroitic (100-300 CE): *sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) *hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) *durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. turgidum) *bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) The site has also revealed many archaeozoological remains, though they have not been as heavily studied as the botanical remains. Evidence of a heavily sheep and goat based economy has been found, along with large numbers of juvenile cattle. These cattle remains suggest a meat- and milk-based economy. The cattle could also have been used for religious ceremonies at the Meroitic Temple. The ritually-deposited remains of a domesticated chicken were also found below a house floor, and date to the post-Meroitic period (late 5th to early 6th centuries CE). = Artefacts = Original Roman caliga, found at Qasr Ibrim, Egypt. 1st century BCE ‚Äì 1st century CE. British Museum, room 65. Qasr Ibrim is known not only for its organic remains, textiles have also been found at the site. During the Roman occupation of the site sandals, textiles, and leather fragments were left behind. Woolen fabrics are believed to have brought to Qasr Ibrim in 23 BCE by the Romans. Cotton fabrics were not introduced until the first century CE by the Meroitic peoples. The un-dyed Meroitic fabrics differ from the wool of the Romans, which has been found in blues and other bright colors. The conditions at Qasr Ibrim have also preserved a large number of documents in nine different languages or scripts. This includes hieroglyphics, Demotic, Meroitic, Greek, Latin, Coptic, Old Nubian, Arabic, and Turkish. Earlier documents were written on papyrus, though parchment was the preferred material for sacred texts. Paper was not common writing material in Nubia until the twelfth century. The nature of the documents range from a variety of religious and secular texts, including personal letters, and religious documents. These documents show the significance of Qasr Ibrim as a frontier society, and the importance of a vast trade network.

The first fortress was built in 1323. It was the scene of many conflicts between Russia and Sweden and changed hands between the two empires. During World War II, it was heavily damaged. Today it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. Oreshek Fortress Inside the fortress walls Interior of the dungeon Origins A wooden fortress named Oreshek () or Orekhov () was built by Grand Prince Yury of Moscow (in his capacity as Prince of Novgorod) on behalf of the Novgorod Republic in 1323. It guarded the northern approaches to Novgorod and access to the Baltic Sea. The fortress is situated on Orekhovets Island whose name refers to nuts in Swedish as well as in Finnish (P√§hkin√§saari, \\"Nut Island\\") and Russian languages. After a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed at Oreshek on August 12, 1323 between Sweden and Grand Prince Yury and the Novgorod Republic. This was the first agreement on the border between Eastern and Western Christianity running through present-day Finland. A modern stone monument to the north of the Church of St. John in the fortress commemorates the treaty. In 1333 Novgorodians invited Lithuanian prince Narimantas to govern their north- western domain. Narimantas appointed his son, Alexander Narimuntovich to rule the autonomous Principality of Oreshek. In 1348 king Magnus Eriksson attacked and briefly took the fortress during his crusade in the region in 1348‚Äì1352.Michael C. Paul, \\"Archbishop Vasilii Kalika, the Fortress at Orekhov and the Defense of Orthodoxy,\\" in Alan V. Murray, ed., The Clash of Cultures on the Medieval Baltic Frontier (Farnham, UK: Ashgate, 2009): 266‚Äì267. It was largely ruined by the time the Novgorodians retook the fortress in 1351. The fortress was rebuilt in stone in 1352, by Archbishop Vasily Kalika of Novgorod (1330‚Äì1352), who, according to the Novgorod First Chronicle, was sent by the Novgorodians after several Russian and Lithuanian princes ignored the city's pleas to help them rebuild and defend the fort.Arseny Nikolayevich Nasonov, ed. \\"–ù–æ–≤–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –ª–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å: —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–≥–æ –∏ –º–ª–∞–¥—à–µ–≥–æ –∏–∑–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤\\".

The remnants of the walls of 1352 were excavated in 1969, and can be seen just north of the Church of St. John in the center of the present fortress. Expansion In 1478, the Novgorod Republic was absorbed by the Muscovy who immediately started to strengthen their border with Sweden. The existing small citadel was demolished and a new stone fortress with seven towers was constructed, which occupied almost the complete island. The old Novgorodian basement was used to construct a new citadel with three towers inside the outer walls. The total length of the walls was about 740 meters. Their height up to 12 meters, and the width at the basement 4.5 meters; The towers were 14-16 meters high and 16 meters in diameter at the basement. This made it the strongest Russian fortress of that period. The residents were forced to resettle on the mainland and most preferred the Southern bank of Neva for safety reasons. In 1554‚Äì55, during the Russo-Swedish war, The Swedes laid siege to the fortress, with no success. In response, Muscovites besieged Vyborg, with no success either. During the Livonian war, in 1582 Swedish troops led by Pontus De La Gardie almost captured the fortress. After a row of artillery fire they managed to break into one of the towers, but were later repelled by Muscovites. The fort was captured by Sweden in 1611 during the Ingrian War after nine months of siege, when the defenders lost every 9 men of 10. As part of the Swedish Empire, the fortress was known as N√∂teborg (\\"Nut- fortress\\") in Swedish or P√§hkin√§linna in Finnish, and became the center of the north-Ingrian N√∂teborg county (slottsl√§n). During that time very little was done to maintain the fortress in good order, and the experts coming to N√∂teborg to do inspections warned the crown of its deterioration . During the Ingrian Campaign of tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in June 1656 the fortress came under a siege by voevoda Potyomkin which lasted until November 1656 with no success. Great Northern War In 1702, during the Great Northern War, the fortress was taken by Russians under Peter the Great in an amphibious assault: 440 Swedish soldiers defended the fort for ten days before surrendering. After heavy artillery fire and 13 hours of fighting inside the fortress, the Swedish commandant finally agreed to capitulate on honorable conditions. The Swedes left the fortress with their flags, rifles and four cannons. The Russian forces numbered 12,500 men and sustained a total of 1,500 casualties, compared to 360 for the Swedes.{see Siege of N√∂teborg (1702)}. Peter renamed the fortress to Shlisselburg, a transliteration into the Cyrillic alphabet of Schl√ºsselburg. The name, meaning \\"Key-fortress\\" in German, which refers to Peter's perception of the fortress as the \\"key to Ingria\\". During Imperial times the fortress lost its military role and was used as a notorious political prison. Among its famous prisoners were Wilhelm K√ºchelbecker, Mikhail Bakunin and, for thirty-eight years, Walerian ≈Åukasi≈Ñski. Ivan VI was murdered in the fortress in 1764, and Lenin's brother, Aleksandr Ulyanov, was hanged there as well. The prison's buildings and former occupants were described in some detail in I. P. Youvatshev's The Russian Bastille or the Schuesselburg Fortress (1909) it being informally known as the Russian Bastille. It is said that immediately after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the prisoners, both political and criminal, were released, and set the prison on fire, but according to Youvatshev the prison had been abolished in 1905. 20th century In 1928, the fortress was turned into a branch of the Museum of the October Revolution, but in 1939, shortly before the war, it was closed and the exhibits were moved to Leningrad . Shortly before Shlisselburg was occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941), a garrison of 350 Red Army soldiers was sent to the fortress on Orekhovets island to bring supplies and munition to the frontline. The garrison held the abandoned castle for 500 days preventing the Germans from landing there and cutting the last transit route from Leningrad to the mainland. Food and supplies were brought from the northern bank of the Neva which remained under Soviet control. Heavy artillery fire by the Germans destroyed all the buildings inside the fortress and part of the outer towers and walls, but despite numerous attempts the fortress was not captured. During Operation Iskra (18 January 1943) the siege of the fortress was lifted. Current condition The war completely devastated the fortress. Out of the original ten towers, the fortress retains only six (five Russian and one Swedish). The remains of a church inside the fortress were transformed into a memorial to the fortress's defenders. An archaeological site was established in the fortress during 1968-1975 that excavated what remained from the ancient Novgorodian stone fort dated 1352 and other artifacts. The fortress has been the site of an annual rock concert since 2003. There is also a museum of political prisoners of the Russian Empire and a small collection of World War II artillery. Renovation of the walls and towers is slow, although still underway. A stone monument in memory of the first Russo-Swedish peace treaty (1323) was placed inside the fortress. Tourists can reach the island from May to October via Shlisselburg or from the Northern bank of Neva, via Petrokrepost' railway station with regular ferries that run every 10-15 minutes.

She was the third of the famous Lennox Sisters, and was notable among them for leading a wholly uncontroversial life filled with good works. Biography Born Lady Louisa Augusta Lennox, she was the third of the four Lennox sisters portrayed in Stella Tillyard's book Aristocrats: Caroline, Emily, Louisa, and Sarah Lennox and in the BBC television series based on it. The Lennox sisters were the daughters of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Lady Sarah Cadogan. The 2nd duke's father, the first duke, was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England. Louisa was still a child when her parents died within a year of each other in 1750 and 1751. After this, Lady Louisa was brought up by her much older sister Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster, in Kildare. In 1758, aged 15, she married Thomas Conolly (1738-1803), grand-nephew of William Conolly, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. Her husband, a wealthy land-owner and keen horseman, was also a successful politician who was elected to Parliament as early as 1759. The couple lived in the Palladian mansion Castletown House in County Kildare, the decoration of which she directed throughout the 1760s and 1770s. The Conolly summer residence 'Cliff House' on the banks of the River Erne between Belleek, County Fermanagh and Ballyshannon County Donegal was demolished as part of the Erne Hydroelectric scheme, which constructed the Cliff and Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power stations. Cliff hydroelectric power station was constructed on the site of 'Cliff House' and was commissioned in 1950. Themselves unhappily childless, at that point they took up the welfare of young children from disadvantaged backgrounds as a lifelong project, contributing both money and effort towards initiatives which would enable foundlings and vagabonds to acquire productive skills and support themselves. They developed one of the first Industrial Schools where boys learnt trades, and Lady Louisa took active personal interest in mentoring the students.History Conolly Family Turtle Bunbury. In middle age, Lady Louisa also virtually adopted her niece Emily Napier (1783-1863), the daughter of her sister Lady Sarah Lennox. Emily, who would spend long months with her aunt in Kildare, married Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet, and moved to Suffolk, although she remained close to her aunt until her death. Thomas Conolly died in 1803. Upon his death, the major part of his estates, which included Wentworth Castle, passed to a distant relative, Frederick Vernon. Lady Louisa received the Castletown House and estate, as also certain liquid investments and valuable urban properties, which enabled her to live in comfort and continue her activities until her own death in 1821. She willed these substantial properties to a great-nephew, Edward Michael Pakenham (grandson of Thomas' sister Harriet), later the MP for Donegal, References * Tillyard, Stella.

The title is derived from the proverb \\"If wishes were horses, beggars would ride\\". Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, people's personal thoughts and fantasies begin to manifest right before their eyes. Plot Quark advises Constable Odo to lighten up, perhaps in a holosuite. Odo dismisses imagination as inattention to real life. Quark offers to create for him a shapeshifter \\"playmate\\", to which Odo retorts, \\"You're disgusting!\\" Seeing the station commander's young son, Jake Sisko, approaching a holosuite, Odo warns Quark he had better not have created any playmates for him. Quark explains that Jake's program includes famous baseball players from Earth. Dr. Julian Bashir and Lt. Jadzia Dax eat lunch. Julian wants a romantic relationship, but Jadzia politely refuses, pointing out he has also eyed other women. Dax returns to Ops, from where she observes elevated emissions in the nearby Denorius Belt. She and Commander Sisko hypothesize this to be due to the high amount of traffic at Deep Space Nine. Chief O'Brien reads to his daughter Molly the story Rumpelstiltskin and tucks her into bed. Shortly, she comes out of her room and claims Rumpelstiltskin is inside. O'Brien and his wife Keiko patiently return with her and find that Rumpelstiltskin is indeed in her room. Elsewhere, a duplicate of Jadzia attempts to seduce Bashir in his quarters, and Buck Bokai, a 21st century baseball player who in 2026 broke Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak, has followed Jake from the holosuite. The characters disappear when rejected or ignored. Unprecedented events, such as snow on the Promenade, occur across the station, apparently instigated by people's imaginations. Quark finds himself escorted by beautiful, adoring women, and hopes the situation will last forever, until he notices his customers are winning at Dabo. He desperately wishes them to lose, but to no effect: as Odo points out, Quark is outnumbered. Odo returns to his office, and discovers he has wished Quark into a holding cell. The wishing outbreak continues until the emissions detected earlier form into a void near the station. It grows exponentially until Sisko realizes it is part of the wish effect, and will continue growing so long as people believe it exists. He instructs his crew that it does not exist, and to stand down from alert status. The crisis is averted. Later, \\"Buck Bokai\\" appears in Sisko's office, where he explains that he is part of an extended mission of exploration that followed a ship through the Wormhole. His people wanted to see what imagination is really about, in order to learn more about humanoids. The aliens did nothing themselves: they only observed the effects of humanoid imagination. Before leaving, he suggests they may one day return. Production The plot of the script evolved from its original draft when Michael Piller - co-creator of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - wanted to differentiate the episode from a Star Trek: The Next Generation installment where a holosuite character comes to life, as such 'imagination' became the central theme of the episode. Another modification to the original script came from Colm Meaney's objection to the use of a Leprechaun due to, in his view, the negative connotations and stereotyping of Irish people. This influenced Piller to use the folk character Rumpelstiltskin instead, which during the re- write became the starting point of the new 'imagination' based story line for the episode.

It is typically used with a possessive adjective: \\"His Highness\\", \\"Her Highness\\" (HH), \\"Their Highnesses\\", etc. Although often combined with other adjectives of honour indicating rank, such as \\"Imperial\\", \\"Royal\\" or \\"Serene\\", it may be used alone. Highness is, both literally and figuratively, the quality of being lofty or above. It is used as a term to evoke dignity or honour, and to acknowledge the exalted rank of the person so described. History in Europe Abstract styles arose in profusion in the Roman Empire, especially in the Byzantine. Styles were attached to various offices at court or in the state. In the early Middle Ages such styles, couched in the second or third person, were uncertain and much more arbitrary, and were more subject to the fancies of secretaries than in later times.Selden, Titles of Honor, part I, Ch. vii. p. 100 In English usage, the terms Highness, Grace and Majesty, were all used as honorific styles of kings, queens and princes of the blood until the time of James I of England. Thus in documents relating to the reign of Henry VIII of England, all three styles are used indiscriminately; an example is the king's judgment against Dr. Edward Crome (d. 1562), quoted, from the Lord Chamberlains' books, ser. I, p. 791, in Trans. Roy. Hist. Soc. N.S. lOX. 299, where article 15 begins with Also the Kinges Highness hath ordered, 16 with Kinges Majestie, and 17 with Kinges Grace. In the Dedication of the Authorized Version of the Bible of 1611, James I is still styled Majesty and Highness; thus, in the first paragraph: \\"the appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists ... especially when we beheld the government established in Your Highness and Your hopeful Seed, by an undoubted title\\". It was, however, in James I's reign that Majesty became the official style. Continental Europe At the conclusion of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, His/Her Highness (abbreviated HH), became prevalent for reigning dukes and members of their dynasties in Germany (e.g. Anhalt, Brunswick, Nassau, the three Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Saxe- Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg, as well as Schleswig-Holstein); for cadets of some German grand ducal houses (e.g., Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg- Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach); and cadet members of some imperial or royal families (e.g., Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Prussia, Yugoslavia). That custom remains official in the Danish, Dutch and Norwegian dynasties. The Almanach de Gotha and Burke's Peerage continued to ascribe Highness to members of deposed dynasties of ducal rank. Among the nobility, the Almanach de Gotha notes that Highness was accorded to the heads of the families of House of Murat (a royal dynasty during the Napoleonic era), Hohenberg and all members of the House of Ligne. Example of official holders of the style Highness: *His Highness Prince Maurits of Orange-Nassau, Van Vollenhoven, son of HRH Princess Margriet of the Netherlands and Mr. Pieter van Vollenhoven, the maternal grandson of HM Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, and nephew of HM Queen Beatrix. Upon his mother's marriage, it was decreed that her children would be known as HH Prince(ss) of Orange-Nassau, Van Vollenhoven. *His Highness Prince Nikolai of Denmark, son of HRH Prince Joachim of Denmark and HE Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, the paternal grandson of HM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. *His Highness Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway son of HRH Crown Prince Haakon and HRH Crown Princess Mette- Marit of Norway, the paternal grandson of HM King Harald V of Norway. Modified forms Usually members of an imperial or royal dynasty are addressed as Imperial Highness or Royal Highness (French Altesse Imp√©riale, Altesse Royale; German Kaiserliche Hoheit, K√∂nigliche Hoheit; Spanish Alteza Imperial, Alteza Real, etc.) respectively. Grand Ducal Highness was the treatment accorded cadet princes of those families of ruling grand dukes who did not simply use \\"Highness\\", viz. Baden, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse and by Rhine and Luxembourg. While \\"Highness\\" (Hoheit) was used for rulers of German duchies, the sovereign Dukes of Modena and of Parma were heads of cadet branches of ruling dynasties of higher rank. They and their cadets therefore used the imperial or royal styles borne by members of those houses, respectively the royal House of Bourbon and the imperial House of Habsburg- Lorraine. In modern times Serene Highness (Altesse S√©r√©nissime) is used as the equivalent of the German Durchlaucht. In the 17th century it became the general style borne by the heads of the reigning princely states of the Holy Roman Empire (reichsst√§ndische F√ºrsten), as \\"Illustrious Highness (Erlaucht) became customary for those of the comital houses (reichsst√§ndische Grafen, i.e. Counts of the Empire). In 1825 the Imperial German Diet agreed to grant the style Durchlaucht to the heads of all mediatized princely houses domiciled in Germany elevated to the rank of F√ºrst are also styled Durchlaucht. In 1829 the style of Erlaucht, which had formerly been borne by the reigning Counts of the empire, was similarly granted to the mediatized countly families (Almanach de Gotha, 1909, 107). Commonwealth realms Highness was the style accorded to princes of the British Royal Family who were the male-line great- grandchildren of a British sovereign (and the wives/widows of great- grandsons), except the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. In 1917 George V revoked authorization for use of that style. The children and grandchildren in the male-line of a British sovereign were and are addressed as Royal Highness (His or Her Royal Highness, abbreviated HRH), as are the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales (decree of 31 May 1898). The sovereign has the right as a legal fons honorum to grant or revoke use of the style of Highness, as with other styles, titles and honours.British Royal Family Website. The Queen and Honours. The Royal Household. Buckingham Palace. accessed 5 February 2019. Colonial use *In the British Empire, the style (His) Highness became reserved for the elite of the feudatory dynastic heads of the major princely states (mainly in India and other territories‚Äîas on the Persian Gulf coast‚Äîonce under the Honourable East India Company). *In various other empires, such as the Dutch East Indies (see List of regencies and cities of Indonesia), a similar system was introduced. Republican and non-royal usage Very rarely, the style of Highness or variations thereof have been used by non-monarchical heads of state, particularly before the 20th century, and often in cases where the distinction between monarchy and republic was blurred. For example, Oliver Cromwell and his wife were styled \\"Highness\\" upon his elevation to Lord Protector of the Commonwealth; he also enjoyed the style of by the Grace of God, was succeeded by his son, and had even been offered the throne. =Spanish-speaking world= In the Spanish-speaking world, a handful of leaders historically enjoyed the official, if often ephemeral, style of Highness (Alteza) or variations thereof. In Spain, Manuel Godoy, who twice served as Prime Minister from 1792 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1808, was granted the style of Most Serene Highness (Su Alteza Seren√≠sima) in 1807 by King Charles IV. He had been created Principe de la Paz (\\"Prince of the Peace\\") in 1795, but the princely title did not carry the style of Highness on its own. The former style was possibly derived from the traditional Spanish honorific of Excelent√≠simo Se√±or (The Most Excellent). Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara, who was regent for Queen Isabella II from 1840 to 1843, and three times served as Prime Minister: in 1837, from 1840 to 1841, and from 1854 to 1856, was created Prince of Vergara in 1872. Espartero had previously declined an offer to the throne following the Spanish Revolution of 1868, which instead went to the Italian Amadeo of Savoy, who in turn bestowed the royal princedom on him. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Royal Decree 1368/1987 promulgated by King Juan Carlos I in 1987, a Regent of Spain is to enjoy the style of Highness (as well as protocolary honours equal to those of the Prince of Asturias), unless they were to possess rank conferring a higher style. During the short-lived Luz de America uprising of 1809 in modern-day Ecuador, the Junta de Gobierno Aut√≥noma de Quito (\\"Autonomous Government Junta of [the Royal Audiencia of] Quito\\"), granted its President, Juan P√≠o de Mont√∫far, 2nd Marquis of Selva Alegre, the style of Most Serene Highness, while claiming for itself the collective dignity of \\"Majesty\\" (as it purported to be acting in the name of King Ferdinand VII). Selva Alegre's pseudo-monarchical government, which was formed following Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808 and lasted for a mere seventy-five days, was considered by both contemporaries and later historians to be a thinly-disguised effort to establish a \\"Kingdom of Quito\\"; Selva dressed himself in regal vestments, bestowed honours on citizens, and instituted the National Order of San Lorenzo (which was much later revived by Ecuadorian President Camilo Ponce Enr√≠quez in 1959). Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of Most Serene Highness during his eleventh and final tenure as President of Mexico for life from 1853 until his deposal in 1855. =Elsewhere= Shortly before the inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, then-Vice President John Adams organised a Congressional committee on the matter of the title and style of the President. There Adams agitated for the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the President. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency, the latter of which was vociferously opposed by Adams, who contended that it was far beneath the presidential dignity, as the executives of the states, some of which were also titled \\"President\\" (e.g. the President of Pennsylvania), at that time often enjoyed the style of Excellency; Adams said that the President \\"would be levelled with colonial governors or with functionaries from German princedoms\\" if he were to use the style of Excellency. On further consideration, Adams deemed even Highness insufficient and instead proposed that the Executive, both the President and the Vice President (i.e., himself), be styled Majesty, with only which the \\"great danger\\" of insufficient dignity being attached to the executive could be solved. Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them \\"the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of\\", while Benjamin Franklin considered it \\"absolutely mad\\". The proposal came to naught, and American Presidents, from Washington onwards, have eschewed honorific titles and styles altogether and are simply referred to as Mr. President. In modern-day Samoa, the O le Ao o le Malo, the Samoan head of state, has since the country's independence enjoyed the title of Highness, as do the heads of the four paramount chiefly dynasties. However, as all of the heads of state, elected by the Fono, the country's parliament (which is itself almost entirely composed of customary chiefs), since independence have been one of the four chiefs, it is ambiguous as to whether the country constitutes a parliamentary republic or a democratic elective monarchy. In Saudi Arabia, all members of the royal family have the title of Emir (Prince) but sons, daughters, patrilineal granddaughters and grandsons of Ibn Saud are referred to by the style \\"His Royal Highness\\" (HRH), differing from those belonging to the cadet branches who are styled as \\"His/Her Highness\\" (HH), and in addition to that a reigning king has the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Emirs of Qatar, Kuwait and UAE also use the style of Your Highness. African royalty commonly use \\"Highness\\" to refer to their junior dynasts. Some ranking monarchs also make use of the style. An example of the former is Princess Elizabeth Bagaya of the Tooro Kingdom in Uganda. An example of the latter is the princess' sister-in-law, Queen Best Kemigisa. Other uses Regardless of the official traditions in the various colonial empires, the style is evidently used to render, often merely informally, various somewhat analogous titles in non-western cultures, regardless whether there is an actual linguistic and/or historical link. Furthermore, in North America, some chiefs of certain indigenous tribes or nations use the style of Highness, which may or may not be recognised by their governments. The Aga Khan was granted the style of His Highness by Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom in 1957 upon the death of his grandfather Aga Khan III. This has been a traditional gesture by British sovereigns since the Aga Khan III allied himself with Britain against Afghanistan. Variations and precedence While the actual precedence depends on the rank itself, and sometimes more specifically on the monarchy, rather than on the style of address, the holders tend to end up roughly in the following order of precedence: *His/Her Imperial and Royal Highness (HI&RH;); *His/Her Imperial Highness (HIH) *His/Her Royal Highness (HRH) *His/Her Grand Ducal Highness (HGDH), used by junior members of the houses of Luxembourg, Grand Ducal Hesse, and Baden *His/Her Highness (HH) *His/Her Exalted Highness (HEH), used only by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the pre-eminent Indian princely ruler *His/Her Sultanic Highness (HSH), a rare, hybrid western-Islamic honorific style, exclusively used by the son, daughter-in-law and daughters of Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt *His/Her Ducal Serene Highness (HDSH) *His Most Eminent Highness (HMEH), a hybrid with His Eminence, created in 1630 for the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, as Prince of the Holy Roman Empire at par with a Cardinal (Prince of the Church). *His/Her Most Serene Highness (HMSH) *His/Her Serene Highness (HSH) *His/Her Illustrious Highness (HIll.H)  See also  *Excellency *Monsignor *Sire  References  Highness ","title":"Highness"},{"id":"2282404","text":"Preamble of the Constitution of India ‚Äì India declaring itself as a country. The Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the states to its citizens and the duties and the rights of the citizens to the State. These sections comprise a constitutional bill of rights for government policy-making and the behaviour and conduct of citizens. These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent Assembly of India. The Fundamental Rights are defined as the basic human rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, applied irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing policies and passing laws. The Fundamental Duties' are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties set out in Part IV‚ÄìA of the Constitution, concern individuals and the nation. Like the Directive Principles, they are not enforceable by courts unless otherwise made enforceable by parliamentary law. History of fundamental rights The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man.Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), Indian History, World Developments and Civics, p. A-23 The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before the law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens. The unsatisfactory Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms of 1919, and the rise to prominence of M. K. Gandhi in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights. The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians. The Commonwealth of India Bill, drafted by Annie Beasant in 1925, specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights ‚Äì individual liberty, freedom of conscience, free expression of opinion, freedom of assembly, non- discrimination on the ground of sex, free elementary education and free use of public spaces. In 1927, the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a \\"Swaraj Constitution\\" for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression. The 11-member committee, led by Motilal Nehru, was constituted in 1928. Its report made a number of recommendations, including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians. These rights resembled those of the American Constitution and those adopted by post-war European countries, and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill. Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution, including the Fundamental Right itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, universal adult franchise, the abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement. Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru, the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement. The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus on minority rights ‚Äì which had become an issue of major political concern by then ‚Äì which were published in the Sapru Report in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a \\"standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts\\". During the final stages of the British Raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India proposed a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as part of the process of transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of fundamental rights, protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J. B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub- committee on Fundamental Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976. Fundamental Rights The Fundamental Rights, embodied in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, and prevent the State from encroaching an individual's liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society. Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution ‚Äì the right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and right to constitutional remedies. However, the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978. The purpose of the Fundamental Rights is to preserve individual liberty and democratic principles based on equality of all members of society. Dr Ambedkar said that the responsibility of the legislature is not just to provide fundamental rights but also and rather, more importantly, to safeguard them. They act as limitations on the powers of the legislature and executive, under Article 13, and in case of any violation of these rights the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts of the states have the power to declare such legislative or executive action as unconstitutional and void. These rights are largely enforceable against the State, which as per the wide definition provided in Article 12, includes not only the legislative and executive wings of the federal and state governments, but also local administrative authorities and other agencies and institutions which discharge public functions or are of a governmental character. However, there are certain rights ‚Äì such as those in Articles 15, 17, 18, 23, 24 ‚Äì that are also available against private individuals. Further, certain Fundamental Rights ‚Äì including those under Articles 14, 20, 21, 25 ‚Äì apply to persons of any nationality upon Indian soil, while others ‚Äì such as those under Articles 15, 16, 19, 30 ‚Äì are applicable only to citizens of India.Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), Indian History, World Developments and Civics, p. A-25 The Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33. Right to Equality The Right to Equality is one of the chief guarantees of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14‚Äì16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination and Articles 17‚Äì18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all people within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification. Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived and in need of special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion. Article 17 abolishes the practice of untouchability in any form, making it an offense punishable by law. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 was enacted by Parliament to further this objective. Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished. However, awards such as the Bharat Ratna have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court on the ground that they are merely decorations and cannot be used by the recipient as a title. =Right to Freedom= The Right to Freedom is covered in Articles 19 to article 22, with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences a&defamation.; The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20‚Äì22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase \\"due process\\" in favor of \\"procedure established by law\\". As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that \\"life\\" under Article 21 meant more than a mere \\"animal existence\\"; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life \\"meaningful, complete and worth living\\". Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned. The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002. 86th Amendment Act, 2002 . * Article 20 provides protection from conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against ex post facto laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self- incrimination. * Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with scepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that when a person is detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity. =Right against Exploitation= Child labour and Beggar is prohibited under the Right against Exploitation. The Right against exploitation contained in Articles 23‚Äì24, lays down certain provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State. Article 23 prohibits human trafficking, making it an offence punishable by law, and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled not to work or to receive remuneration for it. However, it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, including conscription and community service. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, has been enacted by Parliament to give effect to this Article. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, mines and other hazardous jobs. Parliament has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, providing regulations for the abolition of, and penalties for employing, child labour, as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers. =Right to Freedom of Religion= The Right to Freedom of Religion, covered in Articles 25‚Äì28, provides religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, there is no official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. * Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience and the right to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, and the power of the State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. * Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage a property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. * Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. * Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent. =Right to Education and Culture= The Cultural and Educational rights, given in Articles 29 and 30, are measures to protect the rights of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. * Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to, 50 percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community. * Article 30 confers upon all religious and linguistic minorities the right to set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture, and prohibits the State, while granting aid, from discriminating against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a religious or cultural minority. The term \\"minority\\", while not defined in the Constitution, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50% of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30. In order to claim the right, it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or linguistic minority. Further, the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned, or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority. This right is subject to the power of the State to impose reasonable regulations regarding educational standards, conditions of service of employees, fee structure, and the utilisation of any aid granted by it. =Right to Constitutional Remedies= The Right to Constitutional Remedies empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. * Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, in the form of a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 ‚Äì which is not a Fundamental Right in itself ‚Äì to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared. Right to privacy Right to privacy is the latest right of our country being recently approved by the supreme court of Iindia. According to this right we are liable to keep our material private and without our permission no one can interfere in our private matter.it applies to all our private material also. Right to Property was removed from the Indian Constitution in 1978. It is no longer counted as a fundamental right in Indian Constitution. Directive Principles of State Policy The Directive Principles of State Policy, embodied in Part IV of the Constitution, are directions given to the state to guide the establishment of an economic and social democracy, as proposed by the Preamble. They set forth the humanitarian and socialist instructions that were the aim of social revolution envisaged in India by the Constituent Assembly. The state is expected to keep these principles in mind while framing laws and policies, even though they are non-justiciable in nature. The Directive Principles may be classified under the following categories: ideals that the state ought to strive towards achieving; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing. Despite being non-justiciable, the Directive Principles act as a check on the state; theorised as a yardstick in the hands of the electorate and the opposition to measure the performance of a government at the time of an election. Article 37, while stating that the Directive Principles are not enforceable in any court of law, declares them to be \\"fundamental to the governance of the country\\" and imposes an obligation on the State to apply them in matters of legislation. Thus, they serve to emphasise the welfare state model of the Constitution and emphasise the positive duty of the state to promote the welfare of the people by affirming social, economic and political justice, as well as to fight income inequality and ensure individual dignity, as mandated Article 39 lays down certain principles of policy to be followed by the State, including providing an adequate means of livelihood for all citizens, equal pay for equal work for men and women, proper working conditions, reduction of the concentration of wealth and means of production from the hands of a few, and distribution of community resources to \\"subserve the common good\\". These clauses highlight the Constitutional objectives of building an egalitarian social order and establishing a welfare state, by bringing about a social revolution assisted by the State, and have been used to support the nationalisation of mineral resources as well as public utilities. Further, several legislation pertaining to agrarian reform and land tenure have been enacted by the federal and state governments, in order to ensure equitable distribution of land resources. Articles 41‚Äì43 mandate the State to endeavour to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, and the federal government has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision. Article 44 encourages the State to secure a uniform civil code for all citizens, by eliminating discrepancies between various personal laws currently in force in the country. However, this has remained a \\"dead letter\\" despite numerous reminders from the Supreme Court to implement the provision. Article 45 originally mandated the State to provide free and compulsory education to children between the ages of six and fourteen years, but after the 86th Amendment in 2002, this has been converted into a Fundamental Right and replaced by an obligation upon the State to secure childhood care to all children below the age of six. Article 47 commits the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health, and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health. As a consequence, partial or total prohibition has been introduced in several states, but financial constraints have prevented its full-fledged application. The State is also mandated by Article 48 to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines by improving breeds and prohibiting slaughter of cattle. Article 48A mandates the State to protect the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country, while Article 49 places an obligation upon the State to ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance. Article 50 requires the State to ensure the separation of judiciary from executive in public services, in order to ensure judicial independence, and federal legislation has been enacted to achieve this objective. The State, according to Article 51, must also strive for the promotion of international peace and security, and Parliament has been empowered under Article 253 to make laws giving effect to international treaties. Fundamental Duties Indian National Flag is illegal. The fundamental duties of citizens were added to the constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the fundamental duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other fundamental duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defence. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. In case of violation of fundamental duties enshrined in the constitution by a citizen including President, Vice President, Speaker, parliament members, state legislative members, etc., it amounts to contempt of the constitution which is punishable under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Supreme court has ruled that these fundamental duties can also help the court to decide the constitutionality of a law passed by the legislature. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian constitution into conformity with these treaties. The fundamental duties noted in the constitution are as follows: It shall be the duty of every citizen of India ‚Äî # To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem; # To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; # To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; # To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; # To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; # To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; # To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures; # To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform; # To safeguard public property and to abjure violence; # To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement; # Who is a parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child, or as the case may be, ward between the age of six to fourteen years. Criticism and analysis Fewer children are now employed in hazardous environments, but their employment in non-hazardous jobs, prevalently as domestic help, violates the spirit of the constitution in the eyes of many critics and human rights advocates. More than 16.5 million children are in employment. India was ranked 88 out of 159 countries in 2005, according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians.Index of perception of corruption, published by Transparency International. The year 1990‚Äì1991 was declared as the \\"Year of Social Justice\\" in the memory of B.R. Ambedkar. The government provides free textbooks to students belonging to scheduled castes and tribes pursuing medicine and engineering courses. During 2002‚Äì2003, a sum of Rs. 4.77 crore (47.7 million) was released for this purpose.Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), Indian History, World Developments and Civics, p. A-45 In order to protect scheduled castes and tribes from discrimination, the government enacted the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, prescribing severe punishments for such actions. The Minimum Wages Act of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for people working across the economic spectrum. The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 provides for the better protection of consumers. The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976 provides for equal pay for equal work for both men and women. The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (Universal Rural Employment Program) was launched in 2001 to attain the objective of providing gainful employment for the rural poor. The program was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions. A system of elected village councils, known as Panchayati Raj covers almost all states and territories of India. One-third of the total of number of seats have been reserved for women in Panchayats at every level; and in the case of Bihar, half the seats have been reserved for women. The judiciary has been separated from the executive \\"in all the states and territories except Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland.\\" India's foreign policy has been influenced by the Directive Principles. India supported the United Nations in peace-keeping activities, with the Indian Army having participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations. The implementation of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985‚Äì86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim woman who had been divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor implementation of Fundamental Rights. Per Article 38 (1), prompt rendering of the justice by courts is part of animating judiciary. Rendering prompt justice is the foremost purpose of the constitution as enshrined in the Preamble to the constitution also. However the judiciary is failing dismally in this respect by causing inordinate delay considering time of rendering justice in a case arbitrarily is its constitutional liberty. study only Relationship between the Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties The Directive Principles have been used to uphold the Constitutional validity of legislations in case of a conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Article 1C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39(b)‚Äì(c) would not be invalid on the grounds that they derogated from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 21. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.

Located in the state's Upper Peninsula, the building includes the hall of fame and museum, as well as a theater, library, gift shop, offices, and ample storage space for archive material and collections. The current building opened in 1992. History Front view of building The National Ski Association, today known as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, was formed in Ishpeming in 1905, . It was formed during a meeting of ski clubs from Ishpeming, Minneapolis, Red Wing, Minnesota, and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Ishpeming Ski Club founder Carl Tellefsen (1854‚àí1908) was its first president, and for his contribution, he was among the first four to be accorded honored membership in the hall of fame in early 1957. The Roland Palmedo Memorial Library, one of the largest research ski libraries in the United States is housed here. Roland Palmedo (1895‚àí1977) was a ski-sport builder and contributor for more than 50 years. He helped to organize the National Ski Patrol, the teacher certification program, and various early ski teams and clubs. Palmedo also founded Mad River Glen ski area, edited two skiing books, and developed one of the most extensive ski libraries in America.

She was one of the first female travelers, whose bestselling journals were translated into seven languages. She journeyed an estimated 32,000 kilometers by land and 240,000 kilometers by sea through Southeast Asia, the Americas, Middle East, and Africa, including two trips around the world from 1846 to 1855. She was a member of geographical societies of both Berlin and Paris, but was denied membership by the Royal Geographical Society in London as it forbade the election of women before 1913.  Early life  Ida Reyer was born in Vienna on 14 October 1797 to a wealthy textile manufacturer named Aloys Reyer. She had five brothers and a younger sister. As a child, she preferred boys' clothing, liked sports and exercise, and received the same education as her brothers under the encouragement of her father. \\"I was not shy,\\" she wrote in her autobiography, \\"but wild as a boy, and bolder and more forward than my elder brothers.\\" Her first long journey was a trip to Palestine and Egypt when she was five years old. The influence of this experience remained with her. Following the death of her father in 1806, her mother Anna, disapproving of her previously unconventional upbringing, insisted that she wear dresses and take up piano lessons. After Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Vienna in 1809, some of the French troops were quartered in Reyer's home to Ida's dislike. During the grand review held in Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, she protested against foreign occupation by turning her back as the generals rode past. She was introduced to contemporary explorers by her tutor, Franz Josef Trimmel, and became particularly interested in Robinson Crusoe and the writings of Alexander von Humboldt, whom she would later meet in Berlin. On May 1, 1820, she married Dr. Mark Anton Pfeiffer, a lawyer in Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). He was 24 years her senior and a widower with a grown-up son. The couple left for Lemberg a week after their wedding. Dr. Pfeiffer was soon forced to resign after uncovering corruption among senior government officials in Galicia and subsequently found it difficult to regain employment. In order to support her family, Ida moved back and forth between Vienna and Lemberg. She gave drawing and music lessons and borrowed money from her brothers. She gave birth to two sons in Vienna: Alfred in 1821 and Oscar in 1824. The family's financial situation slightly improved after the death of her mother in 1831. With a small inheritance, she was able to continue her sons' education. She stayed in Vienna with the boys in 1833, while Dr. Pfeiffer remained in Lemberg.  Travels = Istanbul, Jerusalem, and Iceland (1842‚Äì1845) = After her sons settled in secure employment, Ida Pfeiffer was finally able to fulfill her childhood dream of traveling to foreign places. She later wrote in Reise nach dem skandinavischen Norden und der Insel Island im Jahre 1845 (‚ÄúVisit to Iceland and the Scandinavian North,‚Äù 2 vols., Leipzig, 1845): > When I was but a little child, I had already a strong desire to see the > world. Whenever I met a travelling-carriage, I would stop involuntarily, and > gaze after it until it had disappeared; I used even to envy the postilion, > for I thought he also must have accomplished the whole long journey. In 1842, she traveled along the Danube river to Istanbul. From there she continued to Jerusalem, stopping at Gallipoli, Smyrna, Rhodes, Cyprus, Beirut, Caesarea, and Jaffa. She returned to Beirut on 10 July 1842 and sailed for Egypt. She visited Alexandria, Cairo, and the Red Sea before returning home via Rome. Among those she met on the trip was landscape painter Hubert Sattler, the British artist William Henry Bartlett, and the Bohemian botanist, Count Friedrich von Berchtold. She published an anonymous account of her journey in Reise einer Wienerin in das Heilige Land (‚ÄúA Vienna woman's trip to the Holy Land,‚Äù 2 vols., Vienna, 1844). In return, she received 700 guilders to fund her next trip. The book was an instant success. It went through three editions and was translated into Czech in 1846 and English in 1852. In 1845, Pfeiffer set out to Scandinavia and Iceland. In preparation for her travel, she studied English and Danish as well as how to preserve natural specimens and take daguerreotypes. The adventure began on 10 April 1845. She traveled from Vienna to Copenhagen, then boarded the Johann on 4 May, reaching Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur on the southwest coast of Iceland in eleven days. She rode to Reykjav√≠k on horseback and toured the geothermal area of Kr√Ωsuv√≠k. She proceeded to visit the Golden Falls and climb the volcano Mount Hekla. After her return to Denmark, she took a small steamer north to Gothenburg, Sweden and from there, went further north to Norway. Image extracted from page 169 of Visit to Iceland and the Scandinavian North (Second edition), by PFEIFFER, Ida Laura. Original held and digitized by the British Library. She came back to Vienna on 4 October 1845 and published her journal the following year: Reise nach dem skandinavischen Norden und der Insel Island (‚ÄúTrip to the Scandinavian North and the island of Iceland,‚Äù Pest, 1846). English translations of the book appeared in Britain and the US in 1852. = First trip round the world (1846‚Äì1848) = In 1846, Pfeiffer started on a journey round the world, visiting Brazil, Chile and other countries of South America, Tahiti, China, India, Persia, Asia Minor and Greece, returning to Vienna in 1848. The results were published in Eine Frauenfahrt um die Welt (\\"A Woman's Journey round the World,\\" 3 vols., Vienna, 1850). She boarded the Danish brig Caroline, sailing southwest from Hamburg out into the Atlantic and across the equator, entering the harbor of Rio de Janeiro on 16 September 1846. Along with Friedrich von Berchtold, she traveled up the Macacu River to Nova Friburgo in southeastern Brazil and ventured deep into the forest, accompanied by a single servant. Upon her return to Rio, she booked a spot on the English barque John Renwick and set off for Chile, arriving at Valparaiso on 2 March 1847. She then sailed to the island of Tahiti before disembarking in Macao on the coast of China on 9 July. For the next two months, she visited temples and villages in Hong Kong, went on a hunting excursion in Singapore, toured Colombo and Kandy, inquired about Bengali traditions in Calcutta, and visited the holy city of Benares. From Delhi, she arranged a bullock cart to Bombay under the advisement of Austrian scholar Aloys Sprenger, passing through Hyderabad and the Daulatabad Fort and the Ellora Caves in Aurangabad.Illustration from \\"The Story of Ida Pfeiffer and her Travels in many Lands\\" On 23 April 1848, she left Bombay for Baghdad, then part of the Ottoman Empire. While exploring the ruins of the ancient city of Ctesiphon, she encountered Prince Emam Qoli Mirza of the Qajar Dynasty. She proceeded to tour the archaeological sites of Babylon, Borsippa, and Nineveh, facilitated by the British Resident Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and Hormuzd Rassam, the British Vice-Consul at Mosul. During the month of Ramadan, she visited local homes in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan (now East Azerbaijan Province in Iran), and was presented to the Vicegerent, Bahman Mirza. In August 1848, she set out for Nakhchivan bordering Armenia, and soon joined a caravan heading for Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. She then crossed the Black Sea into the Russian Empire. A Woman's Journey Round the World was published in 1850 in three volumes, two years after Pfeiffer's return to Vienna. English translations appeared in Britain in 1851, followed by Dutch (1852), French (1858), and Russian (1867). The book garnered reviews in major international journals, such as Le Constitutionnel, The Athenaeum, The Westminster Review, The Literary Gazette, The Straits Times, and Calcutta Review. = Second trip round the world (1851‚Äì1855Ôºâ= To fund her next expedition, Pfeiffer sold 300 guilders worth of specimens to the Royal Museum of Vienna. Carl von Schreibers, director of the Viennese natural history collections, and Austrian archaeologist Josef von Arneth applied for governmental funding on her behalf on the grounds that she had proven herself skilled at procuring rare specimens from far corners of the world. As a result, Pfeiffer was awarded 1,500 guilders . In 1851, she set off to Berlin where she was met with an enthusiastic audience. Among them was her childhood hero, Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt, whose travels in the Americas inspired a great number of contemporary scientists and naturalists, including Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel. Pfeiffer was also welcomed by German cartographer Carl Ritter who was, at the time, Professor of Geography at the University of Berlin and with whom she would continue to collaborate after her departure. From Hamburg, Pfeiffer set sail to London and met with paleontologist Richard Owen, an outspoken critic of Charles Darwin, geographer Augustus Petermann for his expertise on Africa, and William Bartlett, her traveling companion to Jerusalem. On 27 May 1851, Pfeiffer departed for Cape Town, South Africa. She arrived on 11 August and soon sent a box of specimens to Vincenz Kollar, curator of the Natural History Museum in Vienna. She had intended to penetrate deeper into Africa, but her hopes proved impracticable in light of overwhelming expenses. She proceeded across the Indian Ocean to the Malay archipelago, spending two weeks in Singapore where she collected a new species of mole cricket in addition to fish, seaweed, and crustaceans. She spent eighteen months in the Sunda Islands, accompanied by Captain John Brooke, the nephew and heir of Sir James Brooke. She visited the Dayaks of Borneo and became one of the first explorers to report on the traditions of the Bataks in Sumatra and the Malukus. Along the way, she encountered Sultan Abdu'l Rashid Muhammad Jamal ud-din of the principality of Sintang, renowned ichthyologist Dr. Pieter Bleeker in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), and Colonel van der Hart at Bukittinggi in West Sumatra. She was granted permission to enter the territories of local villages where she observed dance performances, acquired a finely carved tunggal panaluan, and accumulated a collection of valuable specimens, including ray-finned fish (Homalopterula gymnogaster) and checker barb (Puntius oligolepis). On 6 July 1853, she sailed across the Pacific to North America. She arrived on the West Coast of the United States during the California Gold Rush and visited Sacramento, Marysville, Crescent City, Santa Clara, and San Jose before heading south to Central America. After stops at New Granada and Peru, she returned to Guayaquil, the main port of Ecuador. In her book A Lady's Second Journey Round the World she relates some unpleasant experiences in Ecuador. However, the ambassador of the United States Friedrich Hassaurek in his book 4 years among Spanish-Americans criticized this chapters of her book, as he conceived it as interesting as a personal narrative, but full of misconceptions and inaccuracies. On 31 May 1854, she boarded a steamer bound for New Orleans where she stayed for three weeks, then toured the Great Lakes Region. In her journal, she described visits to American circuses, theaters, private girls' schools, the Manhattan Detention Complex as well as encounters with the eminent short story writer, Washington Irving, the celebrated surgeon John Collins Warren, and Swiss- American biologist Louis Agassiz. Back in Vienna at the end of July 1855, Pfeiffer completed her narrative, Meine zweite Weltreise (‚ÄúMy second trip around the world‚Äù), published in Vienna in 1856. The English translation, Second Journey round the World, was published by Longmans, followed by editions in Dutch (1856), French (1857), Polish (1860), Russian (1876), and Malay (1877‚Äì1907). The book was well received with positive reviews in Austrian and German newspapers, the English Edinburgh Review, and the American literary magazine Criterion. = Madagascar (1856‚Äì1858) = In May 1857, Pfeiffer set out to explore Madagascar. Her first stop was Cape Town, South Africa. There, she encountered the French civil engineer and slave trader Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert. Unbeknownst to Pfeiffer, Lambert had joined Jean Laborde and a few other Europeans in a plot to replace Ranavalona I, the queen of Madagascar, with the more moderate crown prince, Rakoto (the future king Radama II). Pfeiffer unwittingly became part of the conspiracy and was expelled from Madagascar in July 1857 after the queen discovered the attempted coup.Trial of Ida Pfeiffer and Jean Laborde During Pfeiffer's passage from the capital of Antananarivo to the coastal port of departure, she had unfortunately contracted a disease (likely malaria) and never fully recovered. She suffered through spells of fever on Mauritius and left for London on 10 March 1858. She then traveled to Hamburg but was struck by a renewed outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea. Ida Laura Pfeiffer died in Vienna on 27 October 1858 in the home of her brother, Carl Reyer. A travelogue describing her final voyage, Reise nach Madagaskar (‚ÄúTrip to Madagascar‚Äù), was published in Vienna in 1861 in 2 volumes and included a biography written by her son Oscar Pfeiffer. Ida Pfeiffer dressed for a collection foray with an insect net and a specimen container slung over her shoulder (lithograph by Adolf Dauthage).  Natural history  During her travels, Pfeiffer collected plants, insects, mollusks, marine life, and mineral specimens. Many were sold to Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin and the British Museum, including but not limited to: *Orb-weaver spider (Poltys idea) *Lonchodes pfeifferae *Freshwater prawn (Palaemon idae) *Snails (Vaginula idae and Pupina superba) *Soft-shell turtles from Ambon and Seram of Maluku The Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna purchased 721 specimens from Pfeiffer's collection in Madagascar and Mauritius, including nine species of mammals, fourteen species of birds, twenty-three species of reptiles, three species of crustaceans, fifteen species of mollusks, ten species of spiders, and 185 species of insects.  Contemporary influences  Pfeiffer is referenced as \\"Madam Pfeiffer\\" in Thoreau's book, Walden. Thoreau talks of how she wore more civilized clothes as she got closer to her homeland. Alfred Wallace frequently mentioned Pfeiffer in his letters to his sister, to his colleague Henry Walter Bates, and to Samuel Stevens, a natural history agent in London who supported Pfeiffer's collecting expedition to the Americas. In fact, Wallace would visit many of the same places that Pfeiffer did before him, including the Malay Archipelago. Charles Darwin cited Pfeiffer in his Descent of Man (1871), remarking that \\"in Java, a yellow, not a white girl, is considered, according to Madame Pfeiffer, a beauty.\\"  Legacy  In 1892, the Viennese Society for the Further Education of Women transferred Ida Pfeiffer's remains to a place of honor in the Vienna Central Cemetery. She was the first woman to be admitted to the rows of honored dead.Grave of Ida Pfeiffer, Vienna, 2017 In 2000, a street in Munich was renamed as Ida-Pfeiffer-Stra√üe. In 2018, the University of Vienna established an \\"Ida Pfeiffer Professorship\\" in the Faculty of Earth Sciences, Geography and Astronomy. Pfeiffer has been of interest to historians of travel.

He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1866 and a full academician in 1874. As an enthusiastic amateur musician, he helped the career of the young composer Hamish MacCunn by organizing concerts for him in his own studio. MacCunn, who would marry his daughter Alison in 1888, also served as a model for many of his paintings and sketches in various distinctive occasions. Biography John Pettie by George Anderson Lawson John Pettie was born in Edinburgh, the son of Alexander and Alison Pettie. In 1852 the family moved to East Linton, Haddingtonshire. Initially, his father objected to Pettie taking up art as a career, but this was overcome following a portrait by the lad of the village carrier and his donkey. When he was sixteen he entered the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh, working under Robert Scott Lauder with William Quiller Orchardson, J. MacWhirter, William McTaggart, Peter Graham (1836‚Äì1921), Tom Graham (1840‚Äì1906) and George Paul Chalmers. His first exhibits at the Royal Scottish Academy were A Scene from the Fortunes of Nigel, one of the many subjects for which he sought inspiration in the novels of Sir Walter Scott, and two portraits in 1858, followed in 1859 by The Prison. To the Royal Academy in 1860 he sent The Armourers; and the success of this work and What d'ye Lack, Madam? in the following year encouraged him to settle in London (1862), where he joined Orchardson. In 1866 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1874 received full academical honours in succession to Sir Edwin Landseer. His diploma picture was Jacobites, 1745. Pettie was a hard and rapid worker, and, in his best days, a colourist of a high order and a brilliant executant. In his early days he produced a certain amount of book illustration. His connection with Good Words began in 1861, and was continued until 1864. He painted a portrait of the painter James Campbell Noble RSA and this is exhibited in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In 1894 a selection of his work was included in the Winter Exhibition of the Royal Academy. His self-portrait is in the Tate Gallery. The National Portrait Gallery has four of his works in its collection. Works With William McTaggart and others, he illustrated The Postman's Bag (Strahan, 1862), and with John MacWhirter he illustrated Wordsworth's Poetry for the Young (Strahan, 1863). His principal paintings, in addition to those already mentioned, are: *Cromwell's Saints (1862) *The Trio (1863) *George Fox refusing to take the Oath (1864) *A Drumhead Courtmartial (1865) *The Arrest for Witchcraft (1866) *Treason (1867) *Tussle with a Highland Smuggler (1868) *The Sally (1870) *Terms to the Besieged (1872) *The Flag of Truce (1873) *Ho!

Studios are located within the school, and the transmitter is located on top of the building. Typical show formats include rock, Top 40, classic rock, rap/hip-hop, sports talk, political talk, and sometimes more eclectic genres like classical or jazz. Occasionally, shows feature live performances from local or school-based bands. Students apply for a radio show (usually 90 minutes long), and a typical show has 2-4 hosts. On the basis of interviews and previous experience with the station, students are chosen to fill several positions, including General Manager, Technical Director, Programming Director, Promotions Director, Music Director, and Sports Director. The radio station provides an introduction into the radio or communications industries for students interested in careers in these fields. History WHHS is the oldest high school-run radio station in the country. The station was originally assigned to 89.3 MHz and was granted its first license on February 21, 1950. In 1992, the FCC forced the station to change frequencies to 107.9 MHz. In 2004, a new radio station licensed to Radio One to serve Pennsauken, New Jersey and the Philadelphia market (WRNB, now WPPZ- FM) signed on, requiring WHHS to change frequencies again. With Radio One's help, WHHS moved to 99.9 MHz in 2005. In 2006, the station began broadcasting live sporting events such as football and hockey, even broadcasting live from the Wachovia Spectrum; the former home of the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers. The station is continuing to branch out into the community with the effort spearheaded by producing a product that township residents can understand and enjoy while teaching students necessary skills and encouraging creativity. This has been accomplished in many ways; one of which included a 12-hour election day special along with interviews before the elections with such politicians and Congressman Curt Weldon and Congressman elect Joe Sestak. WHHS celebrated 65 years of the broadcasting in 2014, and held a 24-hour Radiothon which raised funds for the station's future. On January 28, 2017, WHHS-FM announced applications for new disk jockeys during the latter half of the remaining school year.https://twitter.com/WHHSFM/status/825498017394475010 ReferencesExternal links  * Category:High school radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1949 Category:Haverford Township, Pennsylvania HHS Category:1949 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"WHHS"},{"id":"2282509","text":"Kensington Park may refer to: ;Australia * Kensington Park, South Australia, a suburb of Adelaide ;Canada * Kensington Park (Burnaby), a park in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia ;Jamaica * Kensington Park (Kingston), a cricket ground in Kingston ;New Zealand * Kensington Park, Orewa, a subdivision the northern town of Orewa ;United Kingdom * Kensington Park, Bristol, a district * Kensington Park, London, a 19th-century designation for a London residential district now subsumed within Notting Hill * Kensington Gardens, a park in London ;United States * Kensington Park, California * Kensington Park, former name of Kensington, California * Kensington Park, Florida, a census-designated place * Kensington Metropark, Michigan ","title":"Kensington Park"},{"id":"2282511","text":"Pyrene may refer to: *Pyrene, a chemical compound. *Carbon tetrachloride, pyrene is the brand name used by the Pyrene Manufacturing Company for Carbon tetrachloride. *Pyrene (mythology), consort of Ares and the mother of Cycnus in Greek mythology *Pyrene, a Celtic city near the sources of the Danube mentioned by Herodotus: see Heuneburg *The Pyrene Company Limited, a manufacturer of firefighting equipment * The Pyrene Building, Golden Mile (Brentford), a noted former Pyrene Company factory in London, England in the Art Deco style *Pyrene (gastropod), a genus of sea snails from the family Columbellidae *Pyrena, a kind of nutlet *Pyrenees, a mountain range between France and Spain See also * Pyrenoid, a stone-like structure within the chloroplast of hornworts and some algae ","title":"Pyrene (disambiguation)"},{"id":"2282521","text":"Achille Guen√©e (sometimes M.A. Guen√©e; 1 January 1809 ‚Äì 30 December 1880) was a French lawyer and entomologist.

Other former members: Dan Hoffman, Brett Haber, Jared Stern, and David Brody who is credited with giving Flounder his nickname (Because he looked liked Flounder from Animal House) and worked with Elliot at WHTZ. \\"Smell My Face!\\" The show's most prominent catchphrase has an unusual origin. The technically clean but inexplicably lewd-sounding phrase was conceived when the cast of the show was observing mug shots on the Frederick News-Post website (a local newspaper) for persons caught soliciting prostitutes. One picture that caught their eye was a badly disheveled man with a huge, bushy grey beard named Ronny Kline. Imagining what such a man might say to a woman after performing cunnilingus, the phrase \\"smell my face\\" immediately sprang to mind. The phrase became a kind of \\"battle cry\\" and has been heavily integrated into the show's promotional material, with bumper stickers, signs, and highly coveted T-shirts. The show's cast and crew have also solicited (or tricked) numerous celebrities into saying the catchphrase for recordings used to promote the show. So far, there are recordings of Aaron Neville, Marguerite Perrin, H√©lio Castroneves, Brittany Murphy, Mark Hoppus, Joe Frazier, Paul Stanley, Perry Farrell, Constantine Maroulis, Plain White T's, The Pussycat Dolls, Hulk Hogan, John Basedow, Josh Kelley, Sebastian Bach, Timbaland, Juliette Lewis, Pat McGee, Stephan Jenkins, Chyna, Night Ranger, Jeffrey Ross, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, and Chris Cornell. Controversies='Lobster' story= In February 2000, Elliot related a lewd urban legend involving a woman who performed a sexual act with a live lobster. The show continued uninterrupted, but a message from General Manager Mark O'Brien was repeatedly played on the station later in the day condemning the story and announcing Segal's 'indefinite suspension'. Segal returned to the airwaves two days later. The episode has been replayed on \\"Best of...\\" versions of the show, with the offending portions censored. =White House Stunt= On the morning of February 8, 2001, Elliot Segal sent Bryan \\"Flounder\\" Schlossberg to the south fence of the White House, where a gunman had been shot and arrested the previous day, offering passersby to a \\"free shot of bush.\\" The \\"bush\\" in question was an anatomical reference in connection to a spread of porn magazines that were on display. Flounder was connected to the airwaves via cell phone when the Secret Service surrounded him and demanded that he hang up the phone. In the end, Flounder avoided being taken into custody, but was however banned from the grounds of the White House indefinitely. =Bishop O'Connell High School= The morning of May 7, 2002, on D.C. metro area disc jockey Elliot Segal's radio program, DC101's \\"Elliot in the Morning\\", two sixteen-year-old O'Connell students called to be considered in a contest whose winners were to be cage dancers at an upcoming Kid Rock concert at George Mason University's Patriot Center. Instead, goaded by Elliot, they discussed alleged sexual activity at O'Connell. The students claimed to be eighteen. The two discussed giving oral sex to lines of boys in the hallway and having intercourse in stairwells and closets.Quirk, Matthew. Air Pollution. The Atlantic Monthly: May 2004. They implied these acts occurred during a typical school day. The students, who had used false names on air, were suspended the same day for their comments. The principal addressed the student body on the PA system and discussed the immorality of Mr. Segal's radio show. The following day (May 8), Mr. Segal, angered by the students' suspension, personally insulted the principal on air, making lewd remarks about his family and his sexual activity. He also mocked the school's mission statement, specifically what he considered to be a hypocritical statement that their educational environment is \\"rooted in the life of Christ.\\"Quote taken from O'Connell Website's Mission & Beliefs page. The two days of broadcasting were ruled indecent by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As a result, in October 2003, sixteen months after the incident, DC101's parent company Clear Channel Communications was fined $55,000. =Lance Armstrong prank call= In the summer of 2003, Segal conducted an interview with someone he believed to be famous cyclist Lance Armstrong. In reality, the caller was Chad Dukes, currently the co-host of Chad Dukes vs. The World on WJFK-FM in Washington, DC. Dukes stayed in character as Lance Armstrong for over seven minutes on-air without arousing the suspicions of Segal or his co-hosts. When Segal asked Dukes ‚Äì still in character as Armstrong ‚Äì what the greatest moment in his career was, Dukes responded that it was \\"when The Junkies moved to HFS in the mornings you jack- tool-ass-f, I can't believe you thought this was Lance Arm...!\\" Segal abruptly hung up on Dukes in mid-sentence and laughed it off before going to commercial break. =Dan Patrick= On November 8, 2007, Elliot Segal announced that Dan Patrick would no longer be contributing to the show. Patrick, a former ESPN anchor, had commentated on Fridays during football season, but failed to call for two previously scheduled interviews. Elliot said, \\"The Dan Patrick thing just didn't work out and that's fine.\\"Broadcast on November 8, 2007 =December 2008 Suspension= The show was suspended on December 11 and 12, 2008. As part of an agreement to resume broadcasting, Elliot was barred from discussing the reason behind his suspension. =The \\"Monkey Wrench\\" Incident= The show was pulled off the air on August 30, 2010 as Elliot spoke on the telephone with former Clear Channel employee, Jon Ballard, who was fired from sister-station WBIG-FM Big 100.3 earlier in the morning. The conversation abruptly ended when the show was pulled off the air and replaced with music, most notably, \\"Monkey Wrench\\" by Foo Fighters. The show returned the next day and Elliot blamed the incident on upper management.

Hayes was distinguished by his \\"Masterpiece Theatre diction\\" and \\"Oxford accent\\".

He attained a black belt in judo before training as a wrestler under Sir Atholl Oakeley, Bt. Wrestling as \\"Judo\\" Al Hayes, he appeared on the British circuit from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, when he left the United Kingdom and traveled to the United States. He was a blue-eye who battled all of the heavyweight heels of his time, and held the Southern Area Heavyweight Championship for a number of years. He traded heavily on his judo background, and specialised with judo chops and nerve holds. His most famous period was when he fought for Paul Lincoln Promotions as The White Angel, with a massive feud against Dr Death. Death eventually won, and unmasked Hayes. Hayes would later make a homecoming tour of the United Kingdom, including televised matches. During these bouts, he remained a heel and fought his way through most of his former tag partners. It was explained that Hayes had inherited the dreaded \\"American style\\" in his adopted country. =Various North American promotions (1970s‚Äì1980s)= Hayes later went to wrestle in America. In 1972, he defeated Dory Funk Jr. for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but the decision was changed when Funk's father Dory Funk Sr. attacked the referee after the match. In a fit of anger, the official disqualified Funk Jr., thus inadvertently returning the title to the champion. Hayes also wrestled in brief stints for his future employer the WWWF, battling Bruno Sammartino for the World Heavyweight Championship on occasion. While wrestling for Sam Muchnick in St. Louis during the mid-1970s, Hayes turned heel and adopted the gimmick of the aristocratic \\"Lord Alfred\\" Hayes. Hayes adopted the role as a manager after he had decided wrestling was taking a toll on his knees. As this character, Hayes later became a manager in the AWA, Florida and later Montreal, managing fellow Brit Billy Robinson, Baron von Raschke, Jimmy Valiant (whom he rebranded as \\"King James\\" Valiant) and the Super Destroyers. He became notorious for delivering TV interviews in a sneering aristocratic English accent, often sipping cups of tea and wearing a bow tie and frilly shirt. Hayes reverted to babyface and began a feud with fellow manager Bobby Heenan after an incident in November 1979 where Super Destroyer II fired Hayes and replaced him with Heenan. In other territories however, Hayes remained a heel. In Florida in 1980, Hayes began managing Bobby Jaggers while his regular manager Oliver Humperdink was busy acting as Dusty Rhodes' servant for thirty days (after another protege of his, Ivan Koloff lost a match to Rhodes with that stipulation.) When \\"Rooster\\" Humperdink, who had become a figure of sympathy during his thirty days' servitude, returned to management and attempted to claim back Jaggers, Hayes and another protege Nikolai Volkoff brutally beat on Humperdink, thus starting a feud with Humperdink and Rhodes. Hayes later worked again as a heel manager for Robinson in Lutte Internationale in the early 1980s during Robinson's reign with the Canadian International Heavyweight Championship. Hayes also managed Masked Superstar, around this time. =World Wrestling Federation (1982‚Äì1995)= Hayes joined the World Wrestling Federation in 1982. Hayes started as a road agent but then started doing television for McMahon as well, starting work as an interviewer during the December 26, 1983 edition of wrestling at Madison Square Garden. He was a sidekick to Vince McMahon on Tuesday Night Titans, a WWF-style talk show from 1984 to 1986.Figure Four Weekly #528: Lord Alfred Hayes Passes Away - August 8, 2005 Hayes became familiar to WWF viewers as a light-spoken Englishman (using a softer accent than during his period as a heel manager) with an uproarious laugh. On TNT, Hayes usually was the victim of several slapsticks; some instances included getting a face-full of powder, being slopped with pumpkin-innards by \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano, drinking one of Hulk Hogan's diet shakes, then promptly vomiting, being nearly bitten by one of Hillbilly Jim's goats, and getting slapped in the face by \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper. He would later become the introductory announcer on Prime Time Wrestling, on which he would give rousing and complimentary introductions to the face hosts and slightly less flattering but coolly worded intros to Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan. He was once \\"taken hostage\\" from the show by Sgt. Slaughter and his \\"Iraqi\\" allies. Hayes appeared at WrestleMania in 1985 where he was the backstage commentator introducing matches and pre-recorded comments by the wrestlers. As Hayes was announcing the upcoming WWF Women's Championship match to the TV audience, he was affectionately kissed on the cheek by his real life friend The Fabulous Moolah as she and her charge, WWF Women's Champion Leilani Kai walked to the ring for Kai's title defence against Wendi Richter (Kai also kissed a visibly blushing Hayes). Moolah would also kiss Hayes full on the lips during an episode of Tuesday Night Titans. At WrestleMania 2, he served as commentator alongside Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura and the \\"Mistress of the Dark\\" Elvira for the Los Angeles portion of the event. This was the only WWF pay-per-view on which Hayes commentated on the main event (Hulk Hogan vs King Kong Bundy in a steel cage for Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship belt). For the Coliseum Video release of WrestleMania III, Hayes briefly appeared alongside Gorilla Monsoon hyping the event. In 1986, Hayes served as ring announcer for early tapings of WWF Wrestling Challenge. As the WWF's video library began to expand, Hayes became a mainstay in many of the releases; such as \\"Etiquette With Lord Alfred Hayes\\", a short segment on the WWF World Tour 1991 tape, where he attempted to teach table manners to Sensational Sherri and The Brooklyn Brawler. Another great segment on the tape collections took place on the \\"Supertape\\" series when Lord Alfred Hayes would voice \\"The Call of the Action\\" in which a match or two would be slowed down and each manoeuvre named and explained (for instance, the audience could learn what a reverse crescent kick was, long before it became more famously known as \\"Sweet Chin Music\\"). It was also an example of how as late as 1990 or so, professional wrestling was still presented with \\"Kayfabe\\", the veneer of reality. He later appeared on the video releases of WrestleMania VII where he had a corny Love Story-like part regarding the reunion of \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage and his former manager Miss Elizabeth following Savage's career-ending loss to The Ultimate Warrior, WrestleMania VIII, and Royal Rumble 1993 where he famously asked to watch Sensational Sherri put on her stockings while interviewing her in her dressing room, prompting Sherri to mockingly call him a \\"dirty old man\\". He also appeared on some early episodes of Monday Night RAW). Wrestlemania VII also saw the last Wrestlemania match called by Hayes when he joined Monsoon in calling the Intercontinental Championship match between champion Mr Perfect and challenger the Big Boss Man. This was due to Monsoon's co-commentator for the event Bobby Heenan being Perfect's manager at the time and he was required to be at ringside. Lord Alfred also appeared on many episodes of Saturday Night's Main Event, often performing silly recorded acts with fellow WWF commentator/interviewer \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund. One skit involved Hayes and Okerlund (referred to as \\"Jim\\" by Hayes despite Okerlund protesting his name was \\"Gene\\") taking a safari through Africa, encountering many strange sights along the way (Akeem \\"The African Dream\\" and his manager Slick, Koko B. Ware and his parrot \\"Frankie\\", The Bushwhackers, and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts and his pet python \\"Damien\\"). Hayes is known for having spoken the phrase \\"Promotional consideration paid for by the following\\", which was heard at the end of Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge syndicated shows. At WrestleMania fan access, fans would ask him to repeat his line. As a commentator, Hayes maintained his reserved mannerisms; though not specifically a heel, he would be quicker to give praise to heelish characters, though disapproving of underhanded methods (in one match, after being told by Gorilla Monsoon that the Hart Foundation had \\"broken every rule in the book,\\" he replied with a conceding \\"yes, they've done that\\"). He was jokingly referred to by Hulk Hogan as \\"Awful Alfred\\" during interviews. It was during this time that his hearty uproarious laugh would become his trademark, bursting into laughter after a witty comment by his regular broadcast partner Gorilla Monsoon. He would quietly absorb criticism and insults from heel commentators such as Heenan and The Honky Tonk Man. However, toward the end of his WWF run he quietly shifted to a more heelish style, where he would be quicker to take the sides of heels (such as Owen Hart after he turned on Bret) and quicker to insult the faces (calling Paul Bearer a \\"little toad\\"). His final famous WWF promo took place in November 1994, when The Headshrinkers did a promo for \\"Left Guard Sport stick (a parody of Right Guard Sport Stick)\\" and Fatu and Sione (The Headshrinkers) ate the deodorant causing Alfred to keep telling them to stop. Hayes' various roles for the WWF included co-hosting All American Wrestling with Gene Okerlund and doing commentary for shows at Madison Square Garden with Gorilla Monsoon sporadically from 1984‚Äì1990. Hayes' most common broadcast partner was Sean Mooney, whom was paired with Hayes on Prime Time Wrestling, WWF Mania, as well as most all releases for Coliseum Video starting in 1989 until 1993. Hayes and Mooney often participated in comedic skits together, including a Star Trek parody. Hayes was also the announcer for Bobby Heenan's The Bobby Heenan Show, which aired briefly in the Summer of 1989. At one point, he also assisted Edouard Carpentier, Raymond Rougeau and Guy Hauray as a commentator on the French-language broadcasts of the WWF on RDS (R√©seau des sports) in the province of Quebec and throughout Canada. =American Wrestling Federation (1996)= After leaving the WWF, Hayes would later appear as a full-on heel commentator alongside Mick Karch, calling the action in 1996 for the short-lived American Wrestling Federation. Retirement and death Hayes retired from the WWF in 1995 after enduring a series of pay cuts.\\"Wrestlers Are Like Seagulls: From McMahon To McMahon\\" by James J. Dillon McMahon and the rest of the office were reportedly very upset at the news as Hayes was someone that they didn't want to lose. Around this time he was also involved in a serious car accident. As a result of the accident he suffered gangrene and part of a leg had to be amputated. Hayes was a wheelchair user for the remainder of his life. He spent the last few years of his life in a retirement home, only venturing out of the home to make appearances at wrestling conventions sporadically. He later suffered a series of strokes and died on 21 July 2005 at his home in Texas.He was 76 years old. On the first episode of Monday Night RAW to air after his death, WWE paid tribute to Hayes with a ten-bell salute and a video memorial. On 15 November 2010 \\"Old School\\" edition of Raw, his voice-over was a part of the broadcast.

The Fraternity had its origins for students at the University of Illinois and has since spread across the United States, primarily in the mid-west. The Rev. Frederick William Gustav Stiegemeyer, the son of a pastor, was born on January 16, 1878, in a parsonage in Dubuque, Iowa. Early in his life, he decided to follow his father's footsteps and serve the Lord. He received his college education at Concordia College in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and prepared for the ministry at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. The Rev. Stiegemeyer served his congregations faithfully, serving churches in Ohio, West Virginia, and Illinois. In 1911, he accepted a call to St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Champaign, Illinois. As part of his ministry, he was to serve the students at the University of Illinois. In the fall of 1919, he organized the Lutheran Illini League with a combination of ten students. At that time their intentions were to do no more than meet once or twice a week for religious instruction and discussion on contemporary issues. In the fall of 1920, now with twenty members, the Lutheran Illini League rented a house, and in early 1921 was reorganized as the Concordia Club. By 1923 the group regularly participated in campus activities and then adopted the name \\"Concordia Fraternity.\\" This was among the circumstances that encouraged some of the members to give serious thought to once again reorganizing and making it a Greek Letter Fraternity. Meetings were held, and plans were laid to organize as a new national fraternity. Those men who worked on these plans were convinced that they would create a National fraternity that would maintain all the noble aspirations of the Concordia Club founders. Those who shared this conviction were: *Harold Ahlbrand *Wilbur E. Augustine *Norbert W. Behrens *Herman H. Gilster *Arden F. Henry *Russell Henry *Julius J. Seidel *Rev. Stiegemeyer *William H. Welge These men, considered the founding fathers of Beta Sigma Psi, decided to act in the spring of 1925. Incorporation papers were filed for Beta Sigma Psi National Fraternity on April 17, 1925, in Springfield, Illinois. =Growth= The Concordia Fraternity at Champaign had been in correspondence with the Rev. Paul Schmidt, who had formed a similar organization at Purdue University for students. One month after incorporation papers were filed in Springfield, Illinois, members of Alpha chapter drove to Purdue to help organize Beta chapter. Within months, the first National Council of Beta Sigma Psi was elected. In the 1920s, Beta Sigma Psi experienced a prosperous early growth. Gamma chapter at the University of Michigan (1928) and Delta chapter at the University of Nebraska (1929) soon joined Alpha and Beta chapters. By this time, guests from other Concordia Clubs from all around were attending National Council meetings, and Alpha chapter was busy building a new house. When the depression of the 1930s hit, fraternity financing became very difficult, and Gamma chapter was forced to close in 1933. Alpha chapter closed in 1940. During World War II, Beta Sigma Psi had only two chapters, Beta and Delta, with a combined membership of fourteen men. At this time, an undergraduate member named Delmar Lienemann from Delta chapter stepped forward and was elected Secretary-Treasurer. He started his job with nothing more than the National Constitution and a great determination to keep the fraternity alive. Del served Beta Sigma Psi loyally as a volunteer for 22 years, and now the fraternity's highest honor is named for him. Through hard work and determination, Beta Sigma Psi survived World War II, and in 1949, Epsilon chapter was established at Iowa State University. Expansion continued over the next few years as Zeta chapter was organized at Kansas State University in 1951, and Eta chapter followed at the University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla in 1952. That year at the National Council meeting in Ames, Iowa, the fraternity found another leader who would work with Del for many years. John Hingst, an alumnus of Beta chapter, was elected National President and went on to serve for 14 years in that position. Then in 1955, Alpha chapter was reactivated, and in 1962 Iota chapter was chartered at the University of Missouri ‚Äì Columbia. Beta Sigma Psi continued to prosper in the 1960s due to its growing membership, its common faith principles, and the strong leadership of alumni such as John Hingst of Beta chapter and Larry Edwards of Zeta chapter. Throughout the decade, new chapters were formed at several new campuses, including Western Michigan University, Eastern Illinois University, and the University of Minnesota. Growth was so rapid that the fraternity decided to add a full-time staff person. Although Del Lienemann had served faithfully as a loyal volunteer in the role of Secretary-Treasurer, the National Council decided in 1965 that in order for Beta Sigma Psi to become a strong national fraternity, it needed to have a full-time employee. Dick Weiss, an alumnus of Epsilon chapter, was named the fraternity's first salaried Secretary-Treasurer, and the National Headquarters office was moved from Omaha, Nebraska, to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1969, Beta Sigma Psi became a full member of the National Interfraternity Conference. The NIC had long been dominated by large national fraternities with 100 or more chapters. Hence, Beta Sigma Psi became the first \\"niche\\" fraternity to be recognized as a full member of NIC. Soon afterward, other groups representing Latino, African-American, and other religious fraternities sought membership in NIC as well. The Rev. Walter E. Rose, the campus pastor at Eastern Illinois University and pastoral adviser to Mu chapter, moved to St. Louis in 1971 to succeed Dick Weiss as Executive Director. At the suggestion of several parents, Rev. Rose helped to form Phi Beta Chi Lutheran Sorority at the University of Illinois. For a time, he served as the executive director of both organizations and is recognized today as a founder of Phi Beta Chi. Phi Beta Chi has since formed several chapters and become a national sorority. =Challenge and resolve= Beta Sigma Psi faced major difficulties from the 1970s through the early 1990s. Around two- thirds of Beta Sig chapters closed during those years. Some closed as a result of the general decline in Greek communities throughout the country. Others closed due to pressures facing many fraternities at that time, including hazing or poor grades. Many closed because the chapter has lost a commitment to the principles of Beta Sigma Psi. The greatest challenge to the fraternity came when Delta chapter, which had the most initiated members of any Beta Sig chapter, was forced to close in 1994. New leadership came from Craig Varner of Iota chapter, who was elected national president in 1996. Under his leadership, Beta Sigma Psi created an annual Membership Education Forum and revived its Leadership Academy. Expansion focus shifted from large universities to smaller colleges. With these changes, Beta Sigma Psi led all national fraternities in 1999 with a 97% increase in associate members from the previous academic year. During the first part of the 21st century, Beta Sigma Psi has continued to grow even as the Greek population continues to decline. Delta chapter was rechartered in 2006. The National Fraternity has hired full-time staff members to better serve its collegiate and alumni members. Commitment to the principles of Beta Sigma Psi has been emphasized among the chapters. =Into the future= The future of the fraternity is in the hands of its members. Edgar Friedrichs, Beta Sigma Psi's first national president, once observed that \\"Beta Sigma Psi was organized as a means of serving the Church ‚Äì as a means to the end. Let us, therefore, be vigilant lest the means become an end in itself.\\" Statement of principles The following are the principles every member of Beta Sigma Psi strives to live up to: With God's help I will strive to: * Show my faith in Jesus Christ, live the ideals of a Christian gentleman, uphold the traditions and beliefs of the Church, and share my faith with others * Be loyal to Christ, my brothers, and myself * Serve my church, campus, and community through the pursuit of excellence in all my endeavors With the support and encouragement of the brotherhood within Beta Sigma Psi.

It is incorporated into the coat of arms and the badge. The Badge The Badge of Beta Sigma Psi consists of black cross contained in a heart which is superimposed on a gold rose (Luther's Emblem).

Life He was born at Toulouse to an old family of the magistracy. He studied law there with Jacques Cujas, and afterwards at Padua. In 1548 he was admitted to the bar at Toulouse, at once took high rank, and rose to be juge-mage, an office in Languedocian cities about equal to that of privat. He was selected in 1562 as one of the three representatives of the king of France at the Council of Trent. In 1565 he became general advocate to the parlement of Paris, and extended the renaissance in jurisprudence which was transforming French justice. Guy Du Faur de Pibrac In 1573 he was sent by Charles IX of France to accompany as chancellor his brother Henry (afterwards Henry III) to Poland, of which country Henry had been elected king. Pibrac's fluent Latin won much applause from the Poles, but his second visit to Poland in 1575, when sent back by Henry III to try to save the Crown he had deserted, was not so successful. Then he was employed in negotiations with the so-called politiques, and he managed to keep them quiet for a while. In 1578 he became the chancellor of Marguerite of France, queen of Navarre. Although he was fifty, her beauty and intellectual gifts led him to aspire to win her affection; but he was rejected with disdain. Works His oratorical style was rather pedantic, but quotations from the classics had a fresher meaning in his day. He was the friend of Ronsard, de Thou and l'H√¥pital, and left, among other literary remains, elegant and sententious quatraines.

Antonius Johannes van den Broek (4 May 1870, Zoetermeer ‚Äì 25 October 1926, Bilthoven) was a Dutch amateur physicist notable for being the first who realized that the number of an element in the periodic table (now called atomic number) corresponds to the charge of its atomic nucleus. This hypothesis was published in 1911 and inspired the experimental work of Henry Moseley, who found good experimental evidence for it by 1913. Life Van den Broek was the son of a civil law notary and trained to be a lawyer himself. He studied at Leiden University and at the Sorbonne in Paris, obtaining a degree in 1895 in Leiden. From 1895 to 1900 he held a lawyers office in The Hague until 1900, after which he studied mathematical economy in Vienna and Berlin. However, from 1903 on, his main interest was physics. Much of the time between 1903 and 1911 he lived in France and Germany. Most of his papers he wrote between 1913 and 1916 while living in Gorssel. He married Elisabeth Margaretha Mauve in 1906, with whom he had five children. Major contribution to science The idea of the direct correlation of the charge of the atom nucleus and the periodic table was contained in his paperA. van den Broek (20 July 1911) The Number of Possible Elements and Mendeleff's 'Cubic' Periodic System, Nature published in Nature on July 20, 1911, just one month after Rutherford published the results of his experiments that showed the existence of a small charged nucleus in an atom (see Rutherford model). However, Rutherford's original paper noted only that the charge on the nucleus was large, on the order of about half of the atomic weight of the atom, in whole number units of hydrogen mass. Rutherford on this basis made the tentative suggestion that atomic nuclei are composed of numbers of helium nuclei, each with a charge corresponding to half of its atomic weight. This would make the nuclear charge nearly equal to atomic number in smaller atoms, with some deviation from this rule for the largest atoms, such as gold. For example, Rutherford found the charge on gold to be about 100 units and thought perhaps that it might be exactly 98 (which would be close to half its atomic weight). But gold's place in the periodic table (and thus its atomic number) was known to be 79. Thus Rutherford did not make the proposal that the number of charges in the nucleus of an atom might be exactly equal to its place on the periodic table (atomic number). This is the idea put forward by Van den Broek. The number of the place of an element in the periodic table (or atomic number) at that time was not thought by most physicists to be a physical property. It was not until the work of Henry Moseley working with the Bohr model of the atom with the explicit idea of testing Van den Broek's theory, that it was realized that atomic number was indeed a purely physical property (the charge of the nucleus) which could be measured, and that Van den Broek's original guess had been correct, or very close to being correct. Moseley's work actually found (see Moseley's law) the nuclear charge best described by the Bohr equation and a charge of Z-1, where Z is the atomic number. Henry Moseley, in his paper on atomic number and X-ray emission, mentions only the models of Rutherford and Van den Broek. References * H. A. M.

The book can be understood as having three main elements: First, it is a collection of accounts from the TRC hearings - direct testimony of the terrible human rights violations on all sides of the struggle against Apartheid. Second, it is an exploration and analysis of political and moral philosophy relevant to, inspired by, and grounded in the TRC (see President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu). Third, it is biographical, in terms of the author being extremely honest, open, and self-analytical about her own position and experience relative to the TRC - racially as a white Afrikaner, professionally as a radio journalist, emotionally as someone grappling with her nation's bloody past, and personally as her experiences covering the TRC affect her intimate life. Country of My Skull is written as an amalgamation of journalism, prose, personal narrative, and poetry - all of which Krog has been celebrated for - with the goal of capturing the overwhelming moral, emotional, and historical complexity of the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa.

The tunnel is the third longest in Canada, after the Mount Macdonald Tunnel and the Connaught Tunnel, and connects the city's Central Station, in Downtown Montreal, with the north side of Montreal Island and Laval and passes through Mount Royal. The tunnel was originally proposed by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) to provide access to Downtown Montreal without having to cross the already-congested area south of Mount Royal or the route around it to the east. The cost of the tunnel, along with an expansion to the west coast of Canada, caused CNoR to struggle financially before it was nationalized in 1918. Canadian National Railways (CNR), formed from CNoR and several other lines, took over the just-completed tunnel. When CNR also took over the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1923, access to Ottawa and Toronto along the GTR lines made the tunnel largely redundant, and it was limited mostly to branch lines. The structure gauge of the Mount Royal Tunnel limits the height of bilevel cars to . Until 2014, the only trains using the tunnel were commuter trains from Exo's Deux-Montagnes service. From December 2014 to May 2020, it was also used by the Mascouche line, which serves the northeastern part of Montreal Island and the suburbs of Repentigny, Terrebonne, and Mascouche. Exo also considered rerouting its Saint-J√©r√¥me line to Central Station via the tunnel from its current termini at Parc or Lucien L'Allier to save 15 minutes. On May 11, 2020, the Mount Royal Tunnel closed for a period of about three years. It is expected to reopen in 2022, exclusively for R√©seau express m√©tropolitain services. History Plan of the Mount Royal Tunnel linking Mount Royal, Quebec (west) to Downtown Montreal (east) Entry of the Mount Royal tunnel, 1918 Map of 1927 of the Island of Montreal with the position of the tunnel under Mount Royal shown by dashes on the yellow line; the red line shows a proposed, but never completed, access to Central Station. The tunnel was conceived in 1910 by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) as a means to give the company access to downtown Montreal.The standard work on the Mount Royal Tunnel is: The only easy routes along the south side of Mount Royal had long been taken by rivals Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). CNoR wanted to avoid crossing the CPR and GTR lines. Likewise CNoR preferred a direct route as opposed to detouring the railway around the north and east sides of Mount Royal. To finance the costly tunnel option, CNoR planned to develop the low-valued farmland north of Mount Royal into a model community which was named the Town of Mount Royal. CNoR also planned a downtown terminal and associated office and retail developments for low-priced lands at de la Gaucheti√®re Street and McGill College Avenue. Several farms which grew the Montreal melon were bought by the builders to make way for the tracks: \\"There were two years of preliminary bargaining, after which currency by the satchel full was paid over to the owners of the farms which made the Montreal melons famous, in the purchase of their land. More than $1,500,000 was paid out in that way, with currency, in the rush of land speculation that followed the announcement of the plan. One farmer was paid $117,000 and another farm brought $781,783.\\" The Tacoma times. (Tacoma, Wash.), 21 Aug. 1912. Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress. In 1911, the Canadian Northern Montreal Tunnel and Terminal Company was incorporated to build the tunnel and terminal. It was renamed Mount Royal Tunnel and Terminal Company in 1914, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of CNoR. Construction started at the west portal on July 8, 1912. On December 10, 1913, crews from the east and west portals met beneath Mount Royal; they were out of alignment by . The bore measures approximately and has an ascending grade of 0.6% westbound. CNoR placed an order with General Electric in 1914 for 6 boxcab electric-powered locomotives for use in the tunnel; they were delivered in 1916‚Äì1917. Both the locomotives and the electrification were very similar to those of the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway. Lining of the tunnel bore with concrete was completed by 1916 and the 2 parallel standard gauge tracks and 2400 V DC catenary were installed by September 1918. Progress was slowed by the First World War and CNoR's ongoing financial difficulties by the mid-1910s. The first train, with locomotive 601 leading, ran through the tunnel October 21, 1918. The event was little-noticed due to the still-ongoing war and a ban on large public gatherings due to the Spanish flu epidemic. CN Boxcab Electric locomotive used on the Deux-Montagnes suburban train line from 1918 to 1995 On September 6, 1918, the insolvent CNoR was nationalized by the federal government when its board of directors was replaced by a government appointed board of management, implemented by the Department of Railways and Canals. At the same time, the newly appointed board at CNoR was directed to take over the operation of the government-owned Canadian Government Railways (CGR). On December 20, 1918, the Privy Council issued an order creating the Canadian National Railways (CNR) to operate CNoR, CGR and eventually other bankrupt private-sector railways. Ironically, the Grand Trunk became part of CNR in 1923, giving CNR better routes to Ottawa and Toronto and relegating the tunnel line to branch-line status. Nevertheless, it still remains an essential part of Montreal's regional transport system. CNR took over the Mount Royal Tunnel at the time of its completion, along with the virtually empty lands which CNoR's owners, Sir William Mackenzie and Sir Donald Mann, had envisioned would become a signature real estate development. CNR developed this area sporadically from the 1930s to the 1960s, interrupted by the Great Depression and the Second World War. A new terminal, begun in 1931, opened as Central Station on July 14, 1943, resulting in the closure of the \\"temporary\\" CNoR-era Tunnel Terminal near the same location. Central Station consolidated CNR's passenger terminals in the city and also replaced Bonaventure Station which CNR had inherited from GTR. In the late 1950s, the remainder of the CNoR lands acquired in downtown Montreal during the Mount Royal Tunnel project were developed by CNR. The signature Queen Elizabeth Hotel opened in 1958, followed by the CN (name/acronym change in 1960) headquarters building in 1961 and Place Ville-Marie in 1962. On July 1, 1982, CN signed a 10-year agreement with STCUM whereby CN operated the line under contract to STCUM's commuter rail service. On February 12, 1992, Quebec's provincial government announced a $289 million modernization of the Mount Royal Tunnel line, including $130 million awarded to Bombardier for 58 new commuter rail cars. Stations, track, electrification and signalling systems were all upgraded, in addition to the tunnel structure itself. On June 2, 1995, the last of the GE boxcab electric- powered locomotives delivered to CNoR in 1916‚Äì1917 for use in the tunnel were retired by CN after nearly 77 years of service. Locomotive 601, which in 1918 pulled the first train into the tunnel, under its final number as Canadian National 6711 pulled the last outbound train; on the return trip it assisted sister 6710. The old rolling stock was replaced by 58 state-of-the-art MR-90 electric multiple units built by Bombardier Transportation. Recent use Mount-Royal tunnel's eastern portal at Central Station Until May 2020, commuter trains from Exo's Deux-Montagnes and Mascouche lines used the Mount- Royal Tunnel. Before 1995, Via Rail trains to/from Northern Quebec and the northern route to Quebec City (cancelled in 1990) also used the tunnel, being hauled up by boxcabs pre-1990, and coasting downhill. This practice was eliminated when the catenary and signalling were replaced in 1995. The old catenary was 3000 V DC (upgraded from the original 2400 V DC in the early 1980s) and the new catenary is 25 kV AC. The new signalling is CTC. The ventilation shaft is too small to allow the use of diesel electric locomotives in the tunnel. =Purchase of the line by the former AMT= On February 28, 2014, the R√©seau de transport m√©tropolitain's predecessor agency (AMT) and CN announced that the AMT had purchased the Deux-Montagnes line from CN for a sum of $97 million. The agreement gives CN trackage rights for freight trains outside two rush-hour exclusive time windows (08:30‚Äì15:30 and 20:30‚Äì05:30).AMT purchases Deux-Montagnes rail line from CN for $92 million =Double-tracking to Roxboro-Pierrefonds= Also in the works is the double-tracking of the line from Bois-Franc to Roxboro-Pierrefonds, which will enable the RTM to significantly increase the number of trains on the line. Currently, there is a second track from Bois-Franc to slightly past Saraguay (about halfway between Bois-Franc and Sunnybrooke at the A13), but it is not electrified and is used by CN freight trains serving industries along Doney spur.Doney spur =Mascouche line= On December 1, 2014, the Mascouche line opened to passengers. The line uses the Deux-Montagnes line until Jonction de l‚ÄôEst (between the Montpellier and Mont-Royal stations), where it turns onto the St- Laurent subdivision on the way to Mascouche. Trains are operated with the new dual-powered ALP-45DP locomotives, and are initially run under electric power to the Ahuntsic station where the changeover to diesel is done.

Created in 1966, it is to date the oldest event of its kind still active in Africa. Initially biennial alternating with the Carthage Theatre Festival, it became annual in 2014. A directing committee chaired by the Tunisian Ministry of Culture joined together with professionals of the cinema industry is in charge of the organization. The Carthage Film Festival has been designed as a film festival engaged in the cause of African and Arab countries and enhancing the South cinema in general. The main prize awarded is the Golden Tanit named after the Phoenician goddess Tanit. Opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Municipal Theater of Tunis. History Conceived by filmmaker Tahar Cheriaa and officially launched in 1966 by the Tunisian Minister of Culture, Chedli Klibi, this event, the first of its kind in the Arab world, is primarily intended to highlight the sub-Saharan African and Arab cinema, creating bridges of dialogue between North and South and offering a meeting between filmmakers and moviegoers of all sides. Thus Klibi said: Many big names of African and Arab cinema received awards from Carthage before being recognized elsewhere, from the Senegalese Sembene Ousmane (Grand Prize 1966) through the Egyptian Youssef Chahine (Grand Prize 1970) and the Malian Souleymane Ciss√© (Grand Prize 1982), the Palestinian Michel Khleifi (Grand Prize 1988), Tunisians Nouri Bouzid, Ferid Boughedir, and Moufida Tlatli (Grand Prize 1986, 1990, 1994), the Syrian Mohammad Malas (Grand Prize 1992) to the Algerian Merzak Allouache (Grand Prize 1996). The festival's social dimension is found in several Golden Tanit award-winning films, some sadly prophetic like Making Of (2006) by Nouri Bouzid, featuring Bahta, a 25-year- old unemployed and amateur break dancer recruited by extremists to commit a suicide attack. It was at the Carthage Film Festival that FEPACI (Pan-African Federation of Filmmakers) was created in 1970, developing a foundation for South-South film cooperation. The Conferences of the last sessions have emphasised the reputation of the event as a reservoir of ideas and gaining momentum, the Carthage Film festival has opened to the world and enriched its programming by hosting works from all backgrounds. To better meet the expectations and needs of film professionals, the Carthage Film festival has expanded its scope of action with the introduction of various devices such as the Workshop Project, Master Class, and Producer's Network. Eminent personalities of the arts, writers, filmmakers, critics, have served as juries in various official competitions to award the prestigious Tanit. But the true constant of the Carthage Film Festival remains the adherence of an exceptional audience of loyal and passionate moviegoers. The festival is a real popular event which attracts crowds to theaters and creates in the city of Tunis a considerable animation. Rooted in its Arab and African specificity, this meeting of filmmakers, producers, critics, moviegoers North and South has manage to combine cinema, exchange and festive spirit. Since the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the Carthage Film Festival further confirms Tunisia's proximity to Europe and its tradition of dialogue predestines it to become an indispensable hub for North-South and South-South film cooperation. Program The official program includes several sections: the \\"Official Competition\\" and the \\"Panorama section\\" that are open to Arab and African films, the \\"International section\\" which is open to recent movies of high artistic quality, a \\"Tribute section\\" and a \\"Workshop Projects\\" designed to encourage the development of Arab and African films projects by granting \\"help funds for scenario‚Äù and a competitive video section. The official Selection The various sections of the Official Competition of the Carthage Film festival each present 12 films. The official competition for feature films: This selection with three Tanit (Gold, Silver, Bronze) is the most visible part of the Carthage Film Festival and is the heart of the official selection. Twelve Arab and African films reflect the renewal of cinematographic expression and present original works singular in their aesthetic and their statements. The official short film competition: As well as the competition dedicated to feature films, this selection allows to dedicate three Arab and African fiction films in short format (less than 30 minutes). The documentary competition A Golden Tanit awards the best documentary among twelve Arab and African films. The Prize Tahar Cheriaa for a first work: The Golden Tanit \\"Tahar Cheriaa\\" awards the first work of a filmmaker presented in the official selection: official Competition, competition of the first Arab and African film. Carthage Cin√©-Foundation: This international selection of twelve school films embodies the diversity of young artists and announces the trends of the future world cinema. A film will be awarded by the international jury. Parallel sections New Territories This program aims to be a window on recent suggested films, the most innovative and subversive, the most radical and marginal, in a word, on new aesthetic and political experiences, far from any commercial format, media or festival. It seeks to submit the continually renewed ability of cinema to house within it both the issues of its time, the questions of those who make it and their contemporaries as well as the shifting of its artistic, formal and technological expression. Tribute Each edition pays tribute to a Tunisian filmmaker and several international filmmakers offering the public a retrospective of their films or debates meetings inspired by their career. Carthage professional Takmil The Takmil workshop, namely \\"finish\\" in Arabic, which is in its second edition, aims to allows African and Arab films in post-production phase to be evaluated by an international jury of cinema professionals. For three days, working copies are viewed by the jury in the presence of the filmmakers which films have been selected. Screenings will be followed by a discussion allowing each participant to defend his film and benefit from an expertise. The workshop Takmil also aims to be a platform offering visibility to young African and Arab filmmaking. Visibility that will result in particular by the screening of the winning films, an African and Arab premiere during the Carthage Film Festival session following their finishing. Producers Network The Producers Network hosts Arab and African producers present at the Carthage Film Festival and allows international film professionals to benefit from a series of meetings and specific events designed to encourage international co-production and optimize networking. With a 48-hour program, the Producers Network offers real opportunities to meet with potential partners with financing, co- production, distribution needs... The Carthage Film Festival in regions Since the 2014 session, the Carthage Film Festival has moved between different Tunisian cities. In 2015 ten cities are hosting the festival: Jendouba, Sfax, Mahdia, Tataouine, Nabeul, B√©ja, Kef, Kairouan, Gafsa and Monastir. The films are divided into three main sections: * The films of the official selection: these films are screened in the evening during the festival period in each host city. * European films: In partnership with the Journ√©es du Cin√©ma Europ√©en, a selection of European films are screened daily in different cities. * In partnership with UNICEF two children's movies are screened in each city.

It is owned by Radio One and airs an urban adult contemporary radio format. In afternoon drive time, WRNB carries the syndicated D. L. Hughley Show. WRNB's studios and offices are in the \\"555 Building\\" on City Avenue in Bala Cynwyd. WRNB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 17,000 watts. The transmitter is located in the Roxborough neighborhood of Philadelphia at (). The station is short-spaced with two other co-channel FM stations (see See ¬ß Signal note below). WRNB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format, with its HD-2 subchannel simulcasting sister station 103.9 WPHI-FM's hip-hop - urban contemporary sound. History=Early Years= In 1942, a station broadcasting on 100.3 FM first signed on as KYW-FM Philadelphia. It was the sister station to KYW 1060 AM, owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. By the late 1940s, KYW-FM moved to 92.5 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 260 The 100.3 frequency remained dark for a decade and a half. In 1962, WXUR- FM began broadcasting, licensed to the suburban community of Media.Broadcasting Yearbook 1968 page B-140 It was powered at only 4,200 watts, simulcasting the Christian programming of its AM sister station 690 WXUR (now WPHE in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania). WXUR-AM-FM were owned by Carl McIntire, a Bible Presbyterian minister. In 1973, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoked the licenses for both stations, with the FCC ruling that WXUR-AM-FM violated the Fairness Doctrine, refusing to air competing viewpoints. The 100.3 frequency then went silent again for eight years. =WKSZ Kiss 100= In 1981, after a seven-year comparative hearing, the FCC awarded the license to the Greater Media Radio Company, owned by Daniel Lerner. The name referred to the station's city of license, Media, and was not associated with the larger Greater Media, Inc., which locally owned 102.9 WMGK, 950 WPEN and other stations around the U.S. On November 8, 1982, 100.3 FM returned to the air, this time as WKSZ, \\"Kiss 100,\\" with a soft adult contemporary format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-208 By 1987, Kiss 100 was the #1 Arbitron-ranked station among women ages 25 to 54. In the early 1990s, however, the battle for AC listeners heated up, with 101.1 WEAZ (now WBEB) becoming the dominant station for soft music in Philadelphia. Kiss 100 lost ground in the ratings, falling to 17th place in 1992. WKSZ tried to combine AC and oldies with what the station called the \\"50/50 Mix.\\" This failed to turn ratings around, and in 1993, Kiss 100 returned to a playlist of AC love songs. =WPLY as Y100= On March 15, 1993, at 6 a.m., with the station still struggling, WKSZ became \\"Z100,\\" switching to a Top 40 format. The flip came three days after Eagle 106 gave up Top 40 and switched to smooth jazz, creating an opening which WKSZ hoped to fill. New York's WHTZ, located on the same frequency of 100.3 MHz, and calling itself \\"Z100\\" since 1983, demanded that WKSZ drop the name to avoid listener confusion. After a brief legal battle, the call sign and name were changed to WPLY, \\"Y100.\\" The station initially had a slight alternative rock lean, but still played other Top 40 hits, including pop and dance. By early 1995, WPLY evolved into a full time modern rock format, which lasted nearly ten years.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-359 Through the late 1990s, Y100 leaned towards Modern AC, and would shift towards an active rock lean in 2000. In 2000, the station was bought by Radio One for $80 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook page D-385 Radio One focuses mostly on urban music and didn't plan to program an alternative rock station. The company tried to make a deal to swap formats with Greater Media's 95.7 WEJM (now WBEN-FM). At the time, it ran a rhythmic oldies format called \\"Jammin Gold,\\" which would have better fit into Radio One's portfolio. The deal fell through, and Radio One continued to run Y100 as a modern rock station for nearly five years. While ratings had gone down, the station still was moderately successful. =Switch with 103.9= On February 24, 2005, at 11:50 p.m., Y100 ended its alternative rock format. WPHI, an urban contemporary station at 103.9 MHz, also owned by Radio One and known as \\"103.9 The Beat,\\" moved to 100.3 FM. The station at 103.9, in turn, flipped to urban gospel as WPPZ-FM, \\"Praise 103.9.\\" The last song on \\"Y100\\" was \\"Alive\\" by Pearl Jam (which was also the first and last song on WDRE).https://mycitypaper.com/articles/2005-03-31/cover.shtmlY100 Announces Format ChangeY100 Signs Off By 2006, Nielsen BDS/Radio & Records moved WPHI to the urban contemporary panel. Mediabase followed suit in 2011. WPHI-FM's chief rival was WUSL, which had been Philadelphia's long-time Urban Contemporary leader. In fall 2005, former rival personality Colby Colb was hired as the Program Director and afternoon host. For the next few years, 100.3 The Beat enjoyed high ratings, helped by Miss Jones in the morning and Colby Colb in the afternoon. Monie Love and Pooch took over mornings in 2005, with other disc jockeys on the station including Micheal Shawn, DJ Touchtone, DJ Jay Ski, Megatron, DJ Bent Rock, Moshay, Toshamakia, DJ JDS, Laiya and Hansoul. In late 2010, WPHI-FM became the Philadelphia home of the Star and Buc Wild Morning Show, syndicated from New York City. The show had actually been heard in Philadelphia in early 2006 on WUSL but had drawn some controversy and was dropped. =Switch with 107.9= Logo as \\"100.3 WRNB\\" from 2011-2013 On August 27, 2011, WPHI dropped the \\"Beat\\" moniker for \\"100.3 Philly.\\" Radio One was preparing to make another frequency switch, this time moving 107.9 WRNB to 100.3 MHz on September 1.107.9 WRNB to Move to 100.3 on September 1100.3 The Beat Becomes WRNB WRNB was simulcast on both 100.3 and 107.9 until September 2, when the WPHI call sign moved to 107.9, adopted the former \\"Beat\\" format and rebranded as \\"Hot 107.9.\\" (WRNB would continue to air an Urban AC format after the move.) =Urban Oldies= Logo as \\"Old School 100.3\\" from 2013-2016 On March 29, 2013, WRNB went jockless and began promoting a \\"big announcement\\" at 5 p.m. on April 1. At that time, after playing \\"Keep Your Head to the Sky\\" by Earth, Wind, & Fire, WRNB flipped to urban oldies as \\"Old School 100.3.\\" The first song on \\"Old School\\" was \\"Atomic Dog\\" by George Clinton.WRNB Going Old SchoolWRNB Flips to Old School The format played Motown, disco, funk, new jack swing, freestyle, and early hip hop from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The new format was designed to better compete with the dominant Urban AC station in Philadelphia, WDAS-FM. In November 2014, sister station WPHI moved to a classic hip-hop format. In response, WRNB re-added some current music, although the station continued to focus on older urban hits. =Return to Urban AC= On October 6, 2016, WRNB moved back to urban adult contemporary music, once more calling itself \\"100.3 WRNB,\\" and dropping the \\"Old School\\" reference.WRNB Drops Old School 100.3 Branding Radioinsight - October 6, 2016 Logo as \\"100.3 WRNB\\" from 2016-2020 =History of WRNB Call Sign= Beginning in the 1950s, the call sign WRNB was licensed to North Carolina's first full- time rock 'n roll radio station, a 1000-watt outlet in New Bern located at AM 1490 (now sports radio WWNB). WRNB 1490 was also famous for being one of the first radio stations to play Carolina Beach Music. Signal note WRNB is short-spaced to two other co-channel Class B stations: WHTZ Z100 (licensed to serve Newark, New Jersey) and WBIG-FM Big 100 (licensed to serve Washington, D.C.). The cities WRNB and WHTZ are licensed to serve are only 86 miles apart, while the cities WRNB and WBIG-FM are licensed to serve are only 112 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.

His father's identity is currently unknown. Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather that his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah. He was not the crown prince, but succeeded to the throne as a child after the death of Seti II. His accession date occurred on I Peret day 2 around the month of December.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen √Ñgypten, MAS:Philipp von Zabern, (1997), p.201 Origins Historically, it was believed that Tiaa, a wife of Seti II, was the mother of Siptah.Cyril Aldred, The parentage of King Siptah, JEA 49 (1963), pp.41-48 This view persisted until it was eventually realized that a relief in the Louvre Museum (E 26901) \\"pairs Siptah's name together with the name of his mother\\" a certain Sutailja or Shoteraja.Gae Callender, The Cripple, the Queen & the Man from the North, KMT Volume 17, No.1 (Spring 2006), p.52; Callender's source comes from page 140 of Thomas Schneider's ZAS 130 (2003) paper titled Siptah und Beja Sutailja was a Canaanite rather than a native Egyptian name, which means that she was almost certainly a king's concubine from Canaan.Gae Callender, The Cripple, the Queen & the Man from the North, KMT Vol 17 (Spring 2006), p.52 However, Dodson/Hilton assert that this is not correct and that the lady was, instead, the mother of Ramesses-Siptah and a wife of Ramesses II.The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, London (2004) The identity of his father is currently unknown; some Egyptologists speculate it may have been Amenmesse rather than Seti II since both Siptah and Amenmesse spent their youth in ChemmisCyril Aldred, The Parentage of King Siptah, JEA 49 (1963), pp.41-60 and both are specifically excluded from Ramesses III's Medinet Habu procession of statues of ancestral kings unlike Merneptah or Seti. This suggests that Amenmesse and Siptah were inter-related in such a way that they were \\"regarded as illegitimate rulers and that therefore they were probably father and son.\\"J.E. Harris & E.F. Wente, An X-Ray Atlas of the Royal Mummies (Chicago, 1980), p.147 However, another interpretation here is that Siptah was regarded as illegitimate by the later 20th dynasty kings since Siptah required the assistance of Chancellor Bay to secure the kingship since he was just another minor son of Merneptah rather than a direct son of Seti II. A headless statue of Siptah now in Munich shows him seated on the lap of another Pharaoh, presumably his father. The British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson states : The only ruler of the period who could have promoted such destruction was Amenmesse, and likewise he was the only king whose offspring would have required such explicit promotion. The demolition of this figure is likely to have closely followed the fall of Bay or the death of Siptah himself, when any shortlived rehabilitation of Amenmesse would have ended.Dodson, Aidan, (2004), The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, (Egyptian University of Cairo Press) p.181 If Siptah was a son of Seti II, it is unlikely that he would have been considered as an illegitimate king by later 20th Dynasty New Kingdom pharaohs. Due to his youth and perhaps his problematic parentage, he was placed under the guidance of his stepmother‚Äîthe queen regent Twosret.Callender, p.52 Siptah ruled Egypt for almost six years as a young man. Siptah was only a child of ten or eleven years when he assumed power since a medical examination of his mummy reveals the king was about sixteen years old at death. He was tall at 1.6 metres and had curly reddish brown hair and likely suffered from poliomyelitis, with a severely deformed and crippled left foot.Callendar, p.52G.E. Smith, The Royal Mummies (Cairo 1912), pp.70-73 Reign A scarab with king Siptah's name Chancellor Bay publicly boasts that he was instrumental in installing Siptah on the throne in several inscriptions including an Aswan stela set up by Seti, the Viceroy of KushLD III, 202c and at Gebel el-Silsila.LD III, 202aCallender, op. cit., p.63 A key graffito located at the entrance to the Speos of Horemheb at Gebel el-Silsila depicts Bay standing in a pose of adoration directly behind Siptah, who is making an offering to Amun; a following inscription in the graffito reads: :the spirit of the Great Superintendent of the Seal of the entire land, who established the King [Siptah] in the place of his father; beloved of his lord, Bay.PM V, 211 (38); KRI IV: 371, ¬ß35 IX.1 (7); RITA IV, 269, ¬ß35 IX.1 (7); LD III: 202a Bay, however, later fell out of favor at court presumably for overreaching himself and last appears in public in a dated Year 4 inscription from Siptah's reign. He was executed in the fifth year of Siptah's reign, on orders of the king himself. News of his execution was passed to the Workmen of Deir el- Medina in Ostraca IFAO 1254. This ostraca was translated and published in 2000 by Pierre Grandet in a French Egyptological journal.Pierre Grandet, \\"L'execution du chancelier Bay O. IFAO 1864,\\" BIFAO 100(2000) pp.339-345 Callendar notes that the reason for the king's message to the workmen was to notify them to cease all work on decorating Bay's tomb since Bay had now been deemed a traitor to the state.Callender, p.54 Foundation sandstone block showing 2 cartouches of king Siptah (Saptah, Merenptah-Siptah). 19th Dynasty. From the mortuary temple of Merenptah-Siptah at Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Siptah himself is last attested sometime in his 6th regnal Year on a graffito located at the South Temple of Buhen.PM VII: 134 (13E). He likely died in the middle of II Akhet‚Äîperhaps around II Akhet 12 of his 6th Year. This assumes a traditional 70-day mummification period if Siptah was buried on IV Akhet 22. Evidence for his burial on the latter date is recorded in ostracon O. Cairo CG 25792.KRI IV: 414-415, ¬ß55, II (A.27); RITA IV: 322, ¬ß55, II (A. 27); ƒåern√Ω, Ostraca hi√©ratiques, 1: 89-90, 112*; This ostraca from Deir el-Medina mentions that the Vizier Hori visited the workmen of Deir el-Medina first on II Akhet 24 and second on IV Akhet 19.KRI IV: 414-415, ¬ß55, II (A.27); RITA IV: 322, ¬ß55, II (A. 27); ƒåern√Ω, Ostraca hi√©ratiques, 1: 89-90, 112*; idem, Ostraca hi√©ratiques, 2: pl. 108. The final line on the ostracon reads as: \\"IV Akhet 22: Burial took place\\".KRI IV: 414-415, ¬ß55, II (A.27); RITA IV: 322, ¬ß55, II (A. 27) Since this event can only refer to a king's burial, the question here is the identity of this king. Hori was appointed vizier around Regnal Year 6 II Shemu 6 and I Peret [X] of Seti II's reign and held this office through the reigns of Siptah, Twosret and Setnakht and into that of Ramesses III.This information is recorded on O. Cairo CG 25538 and is the last recorded date for the previous vizier, Paraemheb, before his removal from office. Cf. KRI IV: 315, ¬ß54, (A.11); RITA IV: 226, ¬ß54, (A. 11); ƒåern√Ω, Ostraca hi√©ratiques, 1: 16, 34; Hori is first mentioned as Vizier on ODM 697. See KRI IV: 321, ¬ß54, (A.16); RITA IV: 229, ¬ß54, (A. 16) The ostracon could not refer to Setnakht's death because this king died on I Shemu 25 since his son, Ramesses III succeeded him the next day. Twosret was ousted from power by Setnakht; therefore, the burial does not refer to her either. Seti II must have died in late IV Akhet or early I Peret‚Äîafter the 70-day mummification period‚Äîsince a graffito located above KV14, Twosret's tomb, records his burial on III Peret 11.Hartwig Altenm√ºller, \\"Bemerkungen zu den neu gefundenen Daten im Grab der K√∂nigin Twosre (KV 14) im Tal der K√∂nige von Theben,\\" 147-148, Abb. 19. Cf. \\"Der Begr√§bnistag Sethos II,\\" SAK 11 (1984): pp.37-38 & \\"Das Graffito 551 aus der thebanischen Nekropole,\\" SAK 21 (1994): pp.19-28 Therefore, the IV Akhet 22 burial date likely records the burial of Siptah himself. Siptah's death would have occurred sometime around II Akhet 12. Siptah himself would have ruled Egypt for approximately 5 years and 10 months since his predecessor, Seti II, died around the end of IV Akhet and the beginning of I Peret, even if he did not legally assume the throne until the start of II Akhet with the aid of the powerful court official Bay. After his death, Twosret simply assumed his Regnal Years and ruled Egypt as a queen for a year or two at the most. Siptah was buried in the Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV47, but his mummy was not found there. In 1898, it was discovered along with 18 others in a mummy cache within the (KV35) tomb of Amenhotep II. The study of his tomb shows that it was conceived and planned in the same style as those of Twosret and Bay, clearly part of the same architectural design.

When they arrived in the Morea, Constantine made him governor of Glarentza, and Sphrantzes assisted Constantine in the latter's efforts to conquer the remainder of the Morea, but was captured 26 March 1429 in a skirmish outside of Patras and held prisoner until his relationship to Constantine was recognized, and he was paroled back to the Byzantine side to negotiate surrender of the citadel.Chronicle, 17.8-10, 19.1-3; translated by Philippides, The Fall, pp. 36f, 40 While traveling to Epirus as an ambassador, to help arbitrate a peace between Carlo II Tocco and his uncle's illegitimate sons over the succession to rule over Epirus, he was kidnapped by Catalan pirates, along with his retinue, and held at Cephalonia until the pirates took the group back to Glarentza where they were ransomed.Chronicle, 21.1; translated by Philippides, The Fall, p. 45 Upon returning to Constantinople, he was made protovestiarites and appointed ambassador by the Emperor.Chronicle, 21.10; translated by Philippides, The Fall, p. 46 After this point, Sphrantzes was a key supporter of Constantine.

It is a very valuable authority for the events of his own times. The distinctive traits of his work are loyalty to the Palaiologoi -- Sphrantzes often exaggerated their merits and suppressed their defects -- hatred of the Turks, and devotion to Orthodoxy.Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasil πev, History of the Byzantine Empire: 324-1453 (1958), p. 692 Steven Runciman described his work as \\"honest, vivid and convincing\\" and that Sphrantzes \\"wrote good Greek in an easy unpretentious style.\\"Runciman, The Fall of Constantinople (London: Cambridge, 1969), p. 193 There are editions by I. Bekker (1838) in the Corpus scriptorum hist. byz., and in J. P. Migne, Patrologia graeca, clvi. The most recent critical edition of Sphrantzes is by Vasile Grecu (Bucharest, 1966), which appeared with a Romanian translation. Sphrantzes was also translated into German in 1954, and into English by Marios Philippides (Amherst, 1980). There is an edition with Italian translation by R. Maisano, Rome 1990 (CFHB 29). For centuries it was believed that Sphrantzes wrote two works, one the Minor Chronicle and the other the Major Chronicle. The Major Chronicle is more detailed particularly about the siege of Constantinople. But, beginning in 1934, the research of such scholars as J.B. Falier-Papadopoulos, Franz D√∂lger, and Raymond-Joseph Loenertz demonstrated that the Major Chronicle was written decades later by Makarios Melissenos (\\"Pseudo-Sphrantzes\\"), a priest who fled to Naples from a Greek-Venetian island conquered by the Ottomans.

It is the first railway tunnel built in Canada, construction began in September 1854 and the first train passed through the tunnel on December 31, 1860. Since 2017 it has been opened to the public as a free seasonal tourist attraction. The tunnel runs in a north/south direction from Water Street, for a distance of 527 m (1,730 ft). It passes underneath what is now Brockville City Hall, built in 1863‚Äì64 as the Victoria Hall. It was built by the Brockville and Ottawa Railway. The tunnel was designed to provide a rail link from the timber trade of the Ottawa Valley to the Brockville port facilities on the St. Lawrence River ship route. The Brockville and Ottawa Railway, incorporated in 1853, ran from Brockville, through Smiths Falls, to Sand Point, near Arnprior, with a branch line from Smiths Falls to Perth.The railway arrives in Smiths Falls , Railway Museum of Eastern Ontario Its first B&OR; train left Brockville on January 25, 1859, almost two years before finances permitted completion of the tunnel. The Brockville and Ottawa Railway amalgamated in 1878 with the Canada Central Railway, which was absorbed in 1881 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The rail line through the tunnel was later used by special height-shortened steam engines, and then diesel trains into the mid-1970s. The rails and ties were then sold and removed in the 1980s, and the railway tunnel was no longer used as it was built. In 1982, the tunnel was turned over to the City of Brockville by Marathon Realty, the real-estate wing of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 2016‚Äì17, the railway tunnel underwent a major interior rehabilitation to make it possible to travel safely through it on foot. Visitors can now walk from the south portal to the north portal, exiting at the north-end gorge and up a ramp to street level. Prior to the rehabilitation visitors were only able to enter at the south portal and walk a short distance underground. The railway tunnel has received thousands of visitors since it opened completely on August 12, 2017. It now features a modern LED coloured light system, which is programmed in various ways, along with a recorded music track playing while one walks through. Adjacent to the tunnel is a refurbished CPR caboose or van, that was donated in 1987 to the city by the Canadian Pacific Railway. A detailed plaque,Plaque in both English and French, describes the details and story of how cabooses were formerly part of every train. Today the caboose operates as an escape room experience.

A Bude-Light was a very bright oil lamp (later, in its modified form, a gas lamp) invented by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, patented by him on 8 June 1839 and named after Bude, Cornwall, where he lived. History=Lighthouse experiments= As first developed, the light worked by introducing pure oxygen into the centre of an Argand burner. It was claimed to be a cheap way of producing a bright light: the unburned carbon in the oil flame burned incredibly brightly and an intense, white light was produced from the weak yellow flame of the oil lamp. In 1838, Gurney reported the results of his initial tests to Michael Faraday, who recommended the proposal to Trinity House for possible use in lighthouses. It was trialled on an experimental basis in Orford Low Lighthouse in 1839, where its flame was observed to be 2.5 times as powerful as a flame of the same size on a conventional oil lamp; its use in lighthouses was not pursued, however, due to high running costs. =Houses of Parliament= The chair of the parliamentary lighthouse committee, however, Joseph Hume, was involved in the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster at the time and saw a potential opportunity for their use there. In May of 1839, he presented his lamp to a select committee of the House of Commons; subsequently their use was trialled in the temporary Chamber of the House of Commons\\"...the Chancellor of the Exchequer had preferred so far sanctioning the experiment as to allow him 100l. to make the experiment.\\", 18 April 1839, Hansard\\"The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal, Volume 2 - 1839\\". page 223 (at the time the Chamber was unsatisfactorily lit by large numbers of 15-inch candles, earlier experiments with both Argand lamps and gas lighting having thus far failed). Gurney had claimed (and already demonstrated) that his Bude-Lamp would cost the same to manufacture as a similarly-sized Argand lamp, and yet would produce a light more than twice as powerful while burning a quarter as much oil. There were setbacks during the trials, however: it proved difficult to trim the wicks satisfactorily, without interrupting debates, and managing the flexible tubes which provided the oxygen feed further complicated this procedure. Moreover, obtaining pure oxygen (which Gurney had sought to source from Manganese being mined in Devon and Cornwall) proved to be less straightforward and much more expensive than first thought. He therefore began to modify his design, convinced that, by doing so, he would be able to create an 'Atmospheric' Bude-Lamp: by substituting air for oxygen with little detrimental effect. To eliminate the need for maintaining a wick, he explored using coal gas in place of oil. He purified the gas, and impregnated it with vapours of naphtha, turpentine and India rubber; this was then fed through a set of concentric burners designed 'to communicate by conduction and radiation sufficient heat to raise the temperature of the gas to a given point, so as to effect the separation of its charcoal immediately on its leaving the burner, and then [‚Ä¶] to bring fresh atmospheric air to the proper points of the flame'. The chemical changes brought about by this precision mechanical arrangement achieved 'an effulgence adequate to every purpose of internal and external illumination'. Self- regulating Atmospheric Bude-Lamps (enclosed in airtight glass containers, with eduction tubes to remove the fumes and heat) were soon successfully installed in the temporary Commons chamber (and operated 'at a cost of only twelve shillings per night, whereas that of the candles previously used there amounted to six pounds eleven shillings per night'); and indeed their use was promptly extended to the parliamentary libraries, lobbies and one of the committee rooms. Gurney went on to market the lamps for use in churches, public buildings, private residences and shops. Despite his pioneering work in Parliament, however, responsibility for lighting the rebuilt Palace of Westminster was instead divided (for an experimental period) between arch- rivals Sir Charles Barry and Dr David Reid; both their systems proved unsatisfactory, however, and in 1853 Gurney's system was installed. It effectiveness was proved, to the satisfaction of both the Lords and the Commons, and the following year Gurney was placed in sole charge, not only of the lighting but also of heating and ventilating the entire building. His Bude-Light system stayed in use in the Houses of Parliament for over 50 years. Bude Light in the south-east corner of Trafalgar Square, now lit by electricity. The lamp's granite column has been converted into a police post, sometimes described as \\"London's smallest police station\\". = Trafalgar Square = Four Bude Lights, with octagonal glass lanterns, were installed in Trafalgar Square in London in around 1845. They were at some point converted to electricity, and are still in use. Two, across from the National Gallery, are on tall cast bronze columns, and two, in the south-west and south-east corners of the square, on short cast bronze columns on top of wider granite columns. They were made by Messrs. Stevens and Son, of the Darlington Works, Southwark, to designs by Charles Barry.

It has been synthesized using non-aqueous solutions. It is assumed to be present when silicon dioxide (silica) dissolves in water at a millimolar concentration level. Introduction The term silicic acid has traditionally been used as a synonym for silica, SiO2. Strictly speaking, silica is the anhydride of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4. :Si(OH)4 SiO2‚Üì + 2H2O The solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystal structure. The solubility of amorphous silica at the vapor pressure of solutions from 0 to 250 ¬∞C is given by the equation :log C = ‚àí + 4.52 where C is the silica concentration in mg/kg and T is absolute temperature in kelvins. This equates to a maximum solubility of about 2 mmol/L at ambient temperatures. Attempts to produce more concentrated solutions result in the formation of silica gel. Because the concentration of orthosilicic acid in water is so low, the compounds that are present in solution have not been fully characterized. Linus Pauling predicted that silicic acid would be a very weak acid. :Si(OH)4 Si(OH)3O‚àí \\\\+ H+ The situation changed in 2017, when the orthosilicic acid monomer was obtained by hydrogenolysis of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH2C6H5)4, in solution in dimethylacetamide or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound was determined by X-ray crystallography. Neutron diffraction was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms. Disilicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexakis(methylphenoxy) derivative, (CH3C6H4O)3SiOSi(OC6H4CH3)3. Cyclic trisilicic acid, Si3O3(OH)6 and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, Si4O4(OH)8 were synthesized by variations of this method. With these new discoveries, the term silicic acid has become ambiguous: in addition to the traditional use as a synonym for silica, SiO2, it can now be used for the compound Si(OH)4. The traditional usage is retained in this article for quotes from cited publication which use it. The derivative Si(OH)3F has been characterized in aqueous solutions containing silicic acid and the fluoride ion. :Si(OH)4 \\\\+ F‚àí Si(OH)3F + OH‚àí A fluoride Ion selective electrode was used to determine its stability constant.  Oceanic silicic acid  In the uppermost water column the surface ocean is undersaturated with respect to dissolved silica, except for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current south of 55¬∞ S. The dissolved silica concentration increases with increasing water depth, and along the conveyor belt from the Atlantic over the Indian into the Pacific Ocean.The figures here have been drawn using the interactive web site which feeds on annual DSi values from LEVITUS94: World Ocean Atlas 1994, an atlas of objectively analyzed fields of major ocean parameters at the annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales.

Theoretical computations indicate that the dissolution of silica in water proceeds begins with the formation of a ¬∑2 complex, which is converted to orthosilicic acid. The biogeochemical silica cycle is regulated by the algae known as the diatoms.Siever, R. (1991). Silica in the oceans: biological-geological interplay. In: Schneider, S. H., Boston, P. H. (eds.), Scientists On Gaia, The MIT Press, Cambridge MA, USA, pp. 287-295. These algae polymerise the silicic acid to so-called biogenic silica, which is used to construct their cell walls (called frustules).Del Amo, Y., and M. A. Brzezinski. 1999. The chemical form of dissolved Si taken up by marine diatoms. J. Phycol. 35:1162-1170. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1999.3561162.x/abstract Plants and animals Outside the marine environment compounds of silicon have very little biological function. Small quantities of silica are absorbed from the soil by some plants, to be then excreted in the form of phytoliths. Subcutaneous injections of orthosilicic acid solutions (around 1%) in mice were found to cause local inflammation and edema. Peritoneal injections of 0.1 mL of freshly prepared acid were often lethal. The toxicity decreased markedly as the solution aged, to the point that after the solution turned to a gel it had no effects other than mechanical ones. The solutions were equally toxic when administed by intravenous injection, but seasoned or gelled solutions were about as toxic as fresh ones. Research concerning the correlation of aluminium and Alzheimer's disease has included the ability of silicic acid in beer to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive system as well as to increase renal excretion of aluminium. Choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA) is a dietary supplement. It has been shown to prevent the loss of tensile strength in human hair; to have a positive effect on the surface and mechanical properties of skin, and on the brittleness of hair and nails; to abate brittle nail syndrome; to partially prevent femoral bone loss in aged ovariectomized rats; to increase the concentration of collagen in calves; and to have a potentially beneficial effect on the formation of collagen in the bones of osteopenic women.

The Big Necessity also travels to the \\"plumbed and flushed\\" richer countries of the world and discovers crumbling infrastructure, water-borne disease, and neglect. George travels into the sewers of London and the slums of Mumbai; she visits Japanese factories that produce the most advanced toilets in the world and Star City in Moscow, whose astronauts use diapers on space walks. Her third book, Ninety Percent of Everything: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry That Puts Clothes on Your Back, Gas in Your Car, and Food on Your Plate, was released in August 2013. The UK title of this book is Deep Sea and Foreign Going: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry the Brings you 90% of Everything, also released August 2013. Her fourth book is Nine Pints: A Journey Through the Money, Medicine, and Mysteries of Blood (Metropolitan Books, 2018). George graduated with a First-Class Honours BA in Modern Languages at Somerville College, Oxford in 1992 and an MA in international politics in 1994 from the University of Pennsylvania as a Thouron Scholar and Fulbright Fellow. She speaks fluent French and Italian.

It played a major part in the development of house music. History Larry Sherman began operations in 1983 by purchasing Musical Products, then Larry and Jesse Saunders co-founded Trax Records in late 1984. The label design and initial artist signings were done by Vince Lawrence. The first release was \\"Wanna Dance/Certainly\\" by Le Noiz (a pseudonym of Jesse Saunders, TX-101 (matrix number 85 indicated the year of release). Trax Records was an important outlet for house music in its early days, releasing many classics including \\"No Way Back\\" by Adonis (1986), Jamie Principle & Frankie Knuckles's \\"Your Love\\" (1988), Larry Heard's \\"Can You Feel It\\" (1986), and Marshall Jefferson's \\"The House Music Anthem (Move Your Body)\\" in the same year. This latter tune gave a massive boost to house music, extending recognition of the genre outside of Chicago.

The castle of Gormaz (Spanish: Fortaleza de Gormaz or Castillo de Gormaz) is a large citadel located in Gormaz, Spain. It was the largest fortress in Europe after its expansion in 956.Roger Collins, Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796‚Äì1031 (Wiley-Blackwell, 2012), 242 Location The castle is located 13 kilometers south-east of El Burgo de Osma, at Gormaz, in the province of Soria, in the autonomous community of Castile-Leon, Spain. It is situated north of the Duero river, placed on a hill that rises 100 m above the river level. View north of the castle. Features The castle is more than 390 metres long though only 10‚Äì40 metres wide, has 28 towers (originally at least 31), a main gate with a monumental horseshoe arch with remains of painted red and white voussoirs, two posterns, one of which with a small horseshoe arch, three mihrabs corresponding to a \\"musalla\\" or open air collective oratory, use of \\"spoliae\\" of the Roman period, and the remains of a water pool near the monumental gate mentioned before. It was repaired in the 14th century, from which time date the remains of two gates on the southern side. History The original castle was built shortly after 756 AD by emir Abd ar-Rahman I of C√≥rdoba, as part of a state (\\"dawla\\") policy to control rich landowners and peasants, as well as to try to govern and protect the Central Marches in the Douro Valley against the Christians to the North. In 965, Caliph al-Hakem II rebuilt and expanded the castle, as attested by an inscription over one of the gates. Surrounding area Gormaz not only controls a contemporary bridge on the Duero, but it is in an area rich, in all directions, in watch-towers also of the middle of the 8th century AD and with some land-owners' towers such as the one that now serves as the belfry of the church of Bordecorex. The area is rich in relics from this period, near to Sep√∫lveda and Segovia to the West, √Ågreda to the East, Berlanga de Duero to the Southeast. This is probably one of the oldest standing ensembles of military architecture in Western Europe.

Captaincy He was captain of the New Zealand Test and ODI team from 1972 to 1974, and was the first New Zealand captain to record a victory over Australia. Congdon was principally a batsman but also became a useful medium-pace bowler midway through his career. Record breaking His finest moments in Tests were in England in 1973 when he scored 176 at Trent Bridge and 175 at Lord's in successive Tests, and during the determined foray by the Kiwis to the West Indies in 1972, when he took over the captaincy from Graham Dowling. In the Trent Bridge match, New Zealand chased 479 in the final innings, falling short by only 38 runs. At the time, this was a record for a highest score in the fourth innings to lose a match. In 1975, Congdon became the first New Zealand batsman to score an ODI century at Basin Reserve, the second one was scored by Kane Williamson, 43 years later, on 6 January 2018 vs. Pakistan. The innings at Lord's contributed to New Zealand making 551, their highest score in Tests at the time. Asked afterwards how he prepared for Test cricket in his remote, intemperate South Island hometown, he replied that net pitches in Motueka prepared one for anything. Honours In the 1975 New Year Honours, Congdon was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket.

History In 1960, the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) through Quebec from the Ontario border to Rivi√®re-du-Loup was announced. In Montreal, to avoid having to build a huge bridge that would have disfigured the city and destroyed a neighbourhood, engineers opted for the construction of a tunnel located under the Saint Lawrence River and dug a trench under the river bed and buried the tunnel sections to under the river bed. The Longue-Pointe church had to be demolished to make way for the tunnel, and 300 families were expropriated from the village in 1964. The construction was completed in March 1967, just before the opening of Expo 67. Construction cost $75 million. A major four-year refurbishment of the tunnel is slated to begin in 2020. Specifications Inside the tunnel Each of the seven tunnel sections weighs , is long, wide and rises to a height of . In total, the bridge‚Äìtunnel is long. The tunnel was built with sections prefabricated in dry dock and then sunk in the river, below the surface of the water. It is one of the largest prestressed concrete structures in the world and is the longest bridge-tunnel in Canada.

To date, he has released five full-length studio albums as well as several singles and EPs. Johansen draws upon many influences, including folk, pop, and electronica. His albums are composed and produced solely by him, and he usually performs live sets on his own, using preset loops or creating them as he plays. Biography Even Johansen was born, raised, and resides in Bergen, Norway, but he has also lived just outside the southern Scottish town of Lockerbie, where he recorded his On Your Side album. Initially, Even was a founding member of the Norwegian rock bands Libido and Chocolate Overdose. During his involvement with Libido, Even conceived a series of songs he thought were inappropriate for the band. His first solo album, Quiet & Still, was released in 2000 under the alias Magnet (in the United States, the album was released under his real name). The name \\"Magnet\\" originated from when Even was a child with anemia; he was prescribed a special magnetic tattoo on his left shoulder so it could attract iron. Magnet's second album On Your Side was released in June 2003 on Ultimate Dilemma to positive critical acclaim. The album features Magnet's duet with Irish singer-songwriter Gemma Hayes on a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", which was later featured in the 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Following European and North American tour dates throughout 2003 and 2004, Magnet signed to Atlantic Records for his third album The Tourniquet, which was released in May 2005 to further positive acclaim. In 2006, he contributed several songs to the soundtrack of the video game Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.Funcom News: Warner Music and Funcom to release Dreamfall EP by Magnet , last retrieved on 3 September 2006 His fourth studio album, The Simple Life, followed in March 2007 on the Hermetix Recordings label, an imprint of Sony BMG.

Razorcake Magazine which summed up the music and attitude behind the band as \\"The true tequila-guzzlin' sounds of Texxxas!\\". Their unique heavy western sound has brought attention from both fans and press alike. Since their debut in 1999, Ghoultown has released four CDs, as well as several compilations, movies, short films, a comic book and a video game. Biography Formed in 1999, by vocalist/guitarist Count Lyle (Solitude Aeturnus, The Killcreeps), Ghoultown recorded its first 3-song EP in October of that same year. Titled Boots of Hell, the EP illustrated the power of the band's Tex-Mex blend while garnering rabid reviews, a fanbase and independent radio airplay. With Boots of Hell in circulation, the band's early buzz landed them several compilation appearances. The most notable being Skully Records' (NY) Gothabilly 2: Rockin' Necropolis where they share the bill with some of the best psychobilly acts around the world. As a kick off, the band was invited to participate in the world-release show held at NY's infamous CBGB's on Halloween 2000. In early 2001, Ghoultown released their full-length debut Tales from the Dead West. The album, produced by Kol Marshall (Mercyful Fate, etc.), captured the versatility and unique sound of the Texan quintet from the powerful \\"Killer in Texas\\" to the Doors-esque \\"Running From the Sun.\\" \\"This album already has a place on my best of 2001 list,\\" quoted a Harder Beat reviewer who reflected the positive response. Not only were ears turned, but eyes as well as the release pushed the band into new live show territory. With highlight performances such as an Atlanta benefit, which featured Jerry Only of the legendary Misfits as an onstage guest, Ghoultown has played with an amazing variety of bands such as Hank III, Rocket from the Crypt, The Independents, DRI, Bile, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Flametrick Subs, Dick Dale, Road Kings, Men of Porn, Captured By Robots, Fear, Cruxshadows, and The Misfits. By 2002, four of the band's songs were chosen for the soundtrack of the horror-slasher American Nightmare, starring B-movie queen Debbie Rochon (Tromeo and Juliet). The movie script was subsequently altered to include a Ghoultown performance cameo after the director witnessed the band live, and the video for their track \\"Killer In Texas\\" was included as a bonus on the DVD. In the spring of 2002, the band released their follow-up Give 'Em More Rope, and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of Tales from the Dead West, which included tracks from their Boots of Hell EP as well. In the late summer, Ghoultown did a 35 date U.S. tour which included performances at NY's CBGBs to The Garage in L.A. The tour was concluded by a performance at one of the world's largest annual entertainment media conventions, Dragon*Con in Atlanta, where the band has performed for the last two years by popular demand. Hitting 2003, Ghoultown's signature tune \\"Killer In Texas\\" made yet another appearance in a short film called Headcheese which was released on DVD with a movie called Freak. Appropriately, Headcheese was filmed in the same location as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre... house and all! Spending the first half of 2003 performing, the band toured the midwest and east coast, in addition to numerous Texas area shows. By the end of spring, Ghoultown completed work on songs for two upcoming Jon Keeyes films, Slice of Life and Hallow's End, the later in which they will also be making a cameo appearance. These are due on the market around Halloween. In 2004, Ghoultown released a double disc set, Live From Texas!, which showcased their powerful live show on both CD and DVD. \\"Ghoultown puts the grit back into rock 'n' roll with a blazing hellfire vengeance!\\" said Horror Garage in praise of the release, which has garnered extremely positive feedback and become the best selling release to date. Also in 2004, the band managed to creep into the video game market where several of their actual gig posters can be seen in the award-winning Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines PC game. October 2006 saw the release of the full-length Ghoultown album, Bury Them Deep, with a cover painted by illustrator Dan Brereton, creator of Nocturnals. In 2008, Ghoultown had two releases: Skeleton Cowboys, a limited edition hand-numbered 7\\" vinyl single; and Life After Sundown, a full-length studio album (also featuring cover art by Dan Brereton).

With an area of about 3,000 ha, the park is the smallest of Spain's fifteen national parks. The protected area is in the process of being expanded outside the original nature reserve to include neighbouring dryland farming areas. The expansion is part of efforts to improve the condition of the wetland, which has been damaged by over-exploitation of water resources. As well as having national park status, the site enjoys international recognition, being: * a wetland on the list of the Ramsar Convention (1,938 ha)Ficha Informativa sobre Humedales Ramsar * the core of the Biosphere reserve Mancha H√∫meda * a Special Protection Area for birds History Like other Spanish wetlands, the Tablas de Daimiel had a long tradition of waterfowl hunting. As early as 1325 the infante Don Juan Manuel, in his hunting book (Libro de la caza), publicised the attributes of the banks of the river Gig√ºela for falconry. The water resources of the area also provided fishing and power for mills. In 1575, Philip II ordered the compilation of the Topographic Relations which commanded that the Tablas be well looked after. The value of the ecosystem for hunting continued to give the Tablas a certain amount of protection into the 20th century. Although in the 1950s the government promoted land reclamation projects in La Mancha with the aim of reducing the amount of wetland, Franco shot duck in the area and in 1966 the Tablas became a National Hunting Reserve. In 1963 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) launched a project to conserve and manage wetlands, the MAR Project, which drew up a list of wetlands of international importance as a foundation for an international convention on wetlands. The draft called for the protection of wetlands habitats rather than species. The Tablas de Damiel were declared a National Park in 1973. In 1980 the national park was extended and UNESCO included Las Tablas in a biosphere reserve. In 1982 Las Tablas were included on the list of the Ramsar Convention (an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands). In 1987 Las Tablas were declared a Special Protection Area for birds (Zona de Especial Protecci√≥n para las Aves in Spanish) under the European Union's Birds Directive.Tablas de Daimiel: Site ES0000013 Characteristics Bridge in Tablas de Daimiel National Park The park is the last surviving example of floodplain wetlands located in the arid central part of the Iberian peninsula.√Ålvarez-Cobelas, M. & Cirujano, S. 1996. TDNP: Aquatic Ecology and Society (in Spanish). National Parks Autonomous Agency, Ministry of Environment. Being located downstream from the Upper Guadiana Basin, TDNP play an important role in nutrient biogeochemistry. The wetland landscape is characterized by recurrent seasonal inundation which until recently was maintained by both river flooding and groundwater discharges. The park's surface is 19.28 km¬≤, and the highest inundation comprises around 17 km2. TDNP is one of the most important aquatic ecosystems of Spain and was probably the main inland wetland. It is important too because of the great amount of migratory birds that pass by the zone, like ducks and geese. Biological patrimony Tablas de Daimiel Tablas de Daimiel, Ciudad Real Las Tablas de Daimiel are provided with two types of water making an unusual ecosystem: the Guadiana contributes fresh water, while its tributary the Gig√ºela is brackish. =Flora= The fresh water of the Guadiana favors the growth of the Common Reed (Phragmites australis, Phragmites communis), and the briny water of the Gig√ºela favors the growth of the marshy vegetation, principally the Great Fen-sedge (Cladium mariscus). The Great Fen-sedge abounded extraordinarily, and it was one of the most extensive zones in Occidental Europe. There were groups of Bulrushes (g. Typha, Scirpus lacustris, Scirpus maritimus) and Rush (g. Juncus) in the least deep areas. Charophytes' grasslands are one of the most characteristic formations of the National Park, formed by different members of genus Chara (Chara hispida, Chara major, Chara canescens), also known locally as \\"ovas\\", and are able to form an almost continuous tapestry. The only trees present are the tamarisk (Tamarix gallica, Tamarix canariensis). =Fauna=Migratory fauna Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Red-crested Pochard (Netta rufina), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), Wigeon (Anas penelope), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Common Teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian Hobby (Falco subbuteo), Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus), Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), Black- winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis), Bearded Reedling (Panurus biarmicus)... Resident fauna We may find the European freshwater crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), that it was in the past abundant and an important source of income for Daimiel's families, today almost extinguished in these waters. After the introduction of the great predator that the Northern pike (Esox lucius) is, other autochthonous species like the Barbus (Barbus barbus), the Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), or the Chub (Leuciscus cephalus) are now endangered species. In the spring and the summer we may find amphibians and reptiles like the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), the Perez's frog (Pelophylax perezi), the Common Toad (Bufo bufo), the Grass Snake (Natrix natrix) or the water snake Natrix maura. Also we may find mammals like the European Polecat (Mustela putorius), the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), the European Otter (Lutra lutra), the Water Vole (Arvicola amphibius), as well as the ones that live in proximities of the wetlands: the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the Cape Hare (Lepus capensis), the Least Weasel (Mustela nivalis) or the Boar (Sus scrofa). Conservation issues In recent years demand for water for agriculture in the area surrounding the park has reduced the amount of wetland. Overexploitation of water resources has caused the water-table to drop. The key aquifer (\\"aquifer 23\\") has not been able to refill because of the overuse of water created by the ‚ÄúBadajoz (irrigation) Plan‚Äù started in 1952, and of the administrative apathy and lack of suppleness faced with cereal farmers lobbies. The quotas assigned to water-users (about 590 million m3 water / year attributed) correspond to nearly twice the amount of renewable water (about 320 million m3 / year available).Irrigation agriculture at the Guadiana river high basin (Castilla-La Mancha, SPAIN): environmental and socioeconomic impacts. . Gregorio L√≥pez Sanz, 1997.The impossible dream? the upper Guadiana system: aligning changes in ecological systems with changes in social systems. Elena Lopez-Gunn, Pedro Zorrilla Miras, Ramon Llamas. 2010-2011. The 5th page of this document shows comparative photos exposing the dramatic loss of water between 1960 and 2009. Faced with a possible fine from the EU, the Spanish Environment ministry presented in 1995 a transfer project (an aqueduct and miles of pipes between the Tagus and the Mancha H√∫meda) to bring water to the upper Guadiana basin. This extra water was to be used strictly for urban water provision and for the protected ecological zones, not for agriculture. But this project was badly received for two main reasons. Firstly because it assumed that the two depleted aquifers had no chance of recovering, and it chose the easy and cheaper immediate solution with no account taken of future water resources. Secondly because it aimed at replacing the natural hydric system, a principle that is too anti-natural to be easily accepted. Various conservation groups expressed the view that the solution should be found within the Guadiana basin. Various ecological groups have suggested that the national park's designation as a biosphere reserve (within Mancha H√∫meda) should be withdrawn as its ecosystem has been broken. In June 2008, a UNESCO report recommended that the national park lose its biosphere status or, alternatively, that Spain be given an ultimatum to reverse the degradation. In the event, Spain was given time to reverse the degradation.La Unesco da a Espa√±a tres a√±os de plazo para recuperar Daimiel, 2008-6-14, El Pa√≠s. A related article appeared in the English edition of El Pa√≠s 16.09.08 entitled \\"The last stand of Las Tablas de Daimiel\\". A Special Upper Guadiana Plan concerning the western Mancha aquifers started in 2008 with a 5 M‚Ç¨ budget, to be operated for 29 years in order to restore the wetlands. The European Union Water Directive demands wetlands to be in proper state by 2015 but it grants some flexibility in particularly difficult cases, as is so for the Tablas of Damiel in particular, and the Mancha H√∫meda in general - hence the 2027 limit date. This Plan consists of a water bank system that aims at establishing quotas on the basis of social and environmental grounds while taking into account the water use efficiency. In May 2009 a plan was announced to reverse the decline in the wetland area using recycled water. However, some skepticism was shown by environmentalists who noted that the aquifer was not going to be replenished. Subterranean Peat Fire (2009) In the hot summer of 2009, smouldering dry peat fires broke out in the area. Such fires were not a new phenomenon in the region; they had affected the peatlands alongside the Guadiana in previous years, but by reappearing in the National Park, the fires represented another symptom of the wetland's degradation.Edward Owen (2009-10-22), Don Quixote park destroyed by exploitation , The Daily Telegraph Early in 2010 the situation was improved by heavier rainfall than had been experienced for several years. However, analysis clearly show that there will be no notable improvement in the situation without considerably reducing the surface of irrigated cereals while maintaining without increase the surface of traditional crops suited to arid conditions (agricultura de secano in Spanish) and of horticulture (the latter being the most efficient crop in terms of extended water footprint). The Plan also includes buying water rights. This gives scope to use water for the benefit of the national park and also to reassign water quotas in favour of more efficient use than cereal production, including hitherto illegal users, essentially small producers of vines and horticulture which have been found more efficient in water use and generate more income per cubic meter of water used. Still, in the context of Spain's economic crisis, funds have been lacking for this operation. European subsidies are attributed in priority to reforesting land after forests were felled for the production of cereals during the preceding generations. Moreover, within the frame of Europe's present Common Agricultural Policy (in 2010) cereals get more subsidies than other crops. A revision of that politic is due in 2013. The choices that will be made then will be determinant for the future of the Mancha H√∫meda. Another determining factor is the developing of other local economics such as solar electricity, ecotourism, better quality agricultural products, and environmental services (carbon sinks for example).

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, he first appeared in the original Soulcalibur and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. Introduced in the original Soulcalibur, Astaroth is a golem created by a cult worshiping the Greek god of war Ares to locate a cursed sword named \\"Soul Edge\\". Though Astaroth has consistently pursued the sword, his character has changed as the series progresses, eventually transforming into a power hungering creature desiring to consume the sword. Regarded as an iconic character of the series, Astaroth has been noted as fitting a large character stereotype seen in fighting games, featuring strong attacks but slow speed. Astaroth has been described as having easy-to-master gameplay and being popular with fans of strong, hard-hitting characters in fighting games.  Conception and creation During development, care was taken to keep Astaroth's look unique As a character introduced in Soulcalibur, Astaroth's weapon, a giant axe, was decided upon before other aspects of the character were. His design revolved around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established, his appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist Aya Takemura and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. Astaroth was then animated mainly by Nobuko Nimura using motion capture and working directly with the team, while other motion designers created the movements for his grapple attacks. During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soulcalibur story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. Soulcalibur IV lead programmer Masaaki Hoshino called Astaroth his favorite character, stating that because he is \\"so powerful there's always a chance to make a comeback\\". During development, a golem devoid of facial features, armed with a sword and shield, and accompanied by a small girl was considered as a possible character, but scrapped. Before finalizing his appearance several other designs were considered, ranging from a Frankenstein's monster-inspired character to a medieval berserker. Despite having a male voice and physical build, Astaroth was referred to as \\"it\\" in terms of gender for the character's Soulcalibur background information. However the background information in other character profiles instead refer to him as male, and his background information in later titles followed suit. =Design= Astaroth was completely redesigned for Soulcalibur IV Astaroth is shown to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned humanoid with solid white eyes. A black mask wraps around and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open gorget covers the nape of his neck and spiked spaulders cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and feet to the knees respectively, and black garters wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a fauld and cloth loincloth.The types of armor pieces that comprise Astaroth's original attire are taken from Soulcalibur IV's character creation mode, in which they exist as components of Astaroth's secondary outfit Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart. During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming eyes were considered, but were cut from the finished product. Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series. In subsequent titles of the series Astaroth's appearance changed, showing more signs of damage and armor loss in II and in III shifting to a dark maroon skintone. By Soulcalibur IV, Astaroth's appearance was completely changed, altered to resemble a \\"rugged rocky\\" golem. Facial features were completely removed, replaced with a large-mawed fractured head design with a headscarf covering the area around his forehead, eyes, and the back of his head. The remaining areas of his body featured several cracks over his build with red veins glowing from within. Large stone spikes jutted from each shoulder, while a similar pair jutted from each knee. Broken metal armor pieces protected his arms, legs, and chest, while a fauld surrounded his waist. Fans reacted negatively to the character's modified appearance once unveiled, complaining it was \\"monster-ish\\". In most Soulcalibur titles, Astaroth's secondary character models contrast heavily against his primary design. Amongst these have included designs with several bone or spike protrusions from Astaroth's body, to designs inspired by punk fashion. This trend was discontinued in Soulcalibur IV, where his appearance from Soulcalibur was reused instead.  In video games  Introduced in Soulcalibur, Astaroth is a golem created by a cult of Ares to retrieve the cursed sword known as Soul Edge. Upon finding the blade, Astaroth realizes that it is damaged and allies himself with its wielder Nightmare to harvest living souls necessary to restore the blade, planning to steal the blade once completed. However, before he can complete this task, he is confronted by a survivor of his attacks, Maxi, and is slain. Revived by Ares in Soulcalibur II, Astaroth continues after the sword. However, the cult that created him regards this as a betrayal, and places a curse on the golem to dominate him. Astaroth resists and counterattacks the cult, learning in the process his design is not original but instead modeled after a human being, Rock. To assert himself as unique, Astaroth finds and nearly kills Rock at the conclusion of Soulcalibur III, breaking free of Ares' control and transforming in the aftermath. Now hungering for power, he is offered it in return for servitude to Nightmare during the events of Soulcalibur IV, an offer he accepts with the secret goal of devouring Soul Edge itself. Destroyed instead by Maxi, Astaroth's heart is retrieved by the cult responsible for his creation, and a new series of golems all bearing the name \\"Astaroth\\" are created from research conducted upon it. Astaroth's story mode in Soulcalibur VI is a retelling of his creation and service to Nightmare, though now he is aided by a ker, sent by Ares to aid him in obtaining Soul Edge. Outside of the main games in the Soulcalibur series, Astaroth also appears in a Dreamcast VMU mini-game called \\"Cannon Dare\\", in which the player must shoot him out of a cannon by guessing the correct fuse, and later as a playable character in Namco's Pac-Man Fever. Astaroth also appears briefly in Soulcalibur: Broken Destinys Gauntlet storyline, a side story set after the events of Soulcalibur IV, tearing through a forest and challenging the protagonist and allies after they defeat a rampaging Maxi. In the prequel Soulcalibur Legends a similar prototype golem, Astaroth Œ±, is discovered by game protagonist Siegfried. Upon defeat, he joins Siegfried's party as a playable character. = Gameplay = Astaroth's gameplay was developed around the concept of a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soulcalibur series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances. Though noted as having slow attacks, Astaroth has been described as being an easy-to-learn character capable of dealing high amounts of damage, though his advantages and disadvantages have been described as part of the \\"big guy\\" role he has in the game's roster. Several of his attacks cover a wide range, while several of his grapple attacks allow room to deal with various defensive measures by opponents. Other attacks such as \\"Poseidon Tide\\" allow Astaroth to control the opponent's distance from himself while simultaneously dealing damage, with the additional feature of offering defensive measures of their own. = Promotion = In 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of action figures based on characters from the original Soulcalibur, amongst them Astaroth. The semi- posable figure of Astaroth was packaged with equipable weapons from the title. In August 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released an Astaroth sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from Soulcalibur II. The immobile figure was modeled after his secondary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base.  Promotion and reception  Astaroth has been described as one of the \\"staple\\" and \\"stalwart\\" characters of the Soulcalibur franchise by GameTrailers. He has been noted as being a stereotypical large character villain in the series by author Rachael Hutchinson. GameDaily named him one of their favorite heavily muscled characters in video games, noting his strength and the impact of his weapon. Insert Credit Tim Rogers stated \\"It takes a certain kind of gamer to prefer Astaroth\\", noting him as a character popular with fans of \\"kickass\\" or \\"evil\\" characters. The New York Times noted his size and appearance alongside Nightmare's as standouts in the series, adding \\"they offer characters made for the sort of player who would have preferred Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, or Shaquille O'Neal to Michael Jordan\\". In 2013, Complex enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking him the tenth best character.

Hunnicutt Field is a stadium in Princeton, West Virginia. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of a yet-to-be-named team in the summer collegiate Appalachian League. It is also home to the teams of Princeton Middle School and Princeton High School, located adjacent to the high school football field. Built in 1988, it was developed by the H.P. and Anne S. Hunnicutt Foundation, and it holds 1,700. The stadium was updated in 1999 from wooden bleachers and press boxes to a modernized stadium featuring wrap around bleacher seating down each foul line and box seats behind home plate. Also added were home and visitor locker areas, coach's offices, and training rooms. More recently, a new batting tunnel was constructed near the main gate of the stadium which can accommodate practices in inclement weather. Tenants Hunnicutt Field has been home to numerous tenants throughout the years. The first team to play in Princeton was a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate. They stayed from 1988 to 1989 then quickly left. The Philadelphia Phillies quickly set up a co-op with the Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves called the Princeton Patriots. The co-op only lasted through 1990 when the Cincinnati Reds decided to add a team in 1991. The Reds had several successful years but left in 1996. The Tampa Bay Rays' Princeton Rays settled down at Hunnicutt Field in 1997 and remained until after the 2020 season.http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t455&ymd;=20060201&content;_id=40039&vkey;=team4 ReferencesExternal links * H.P.

Biography Khalil Raad, Signed portrait of Khalil Sakakini, Jerusalem, 1906 Khalil Sakakini was born into an Arab Christian family in Jerusalem on 23 January 1878. He received his schooling in Jerusalem at the Greek Orthodox school, at the Anglican Christian Mission Society (CMS) College founded by Bishop Blyth, and at the Zion English College where he read Literature. Later, Sakakini traveled to the United Kingdom and from there to the United States to join his brother Yusif, an itinerant salesman living in Philadelphia. During his nine-month stay in America, Khalil Sakakini wrote for Arabic literary magazines on the East Coast, and did translations for Professor Richard Gottheil at Columbia University. He supported himself by teaching Arabic and working in a factory in Maine; he also worked as a street vendor. Upon his return in 1908, Khalil Sakakini worked as a journalist for the Jerusalem newspaper al-Asmai', taught Arabic at the Salahiyya school and tutored expatriates at the American Colony.Sakakini's wife, Sultana, died in October 1939 and was buried in the Greek Orthodox cemetery on Mount Zion. He mourned her for the rest of his days, and wrote poems eulogizing her. His son, Sari, completed his Master's degree at the University of Michigan and returned to Jerusalem, to work for the American consulate.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 199ff; Hala Sakakini, Jerusalem and I (Amman: n.p., 1987), p76ff.; Sakakini to his son, 17 January 1933 ISA P/378/2646 in During the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, the Sakakinis were one of the last families to leave the Katamon neighborhood. A few days before the city was divided, the Sakakini family fled to Cairo. There, Khalil Sakakini was nominated by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein to join the Arabic Language Academy.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 230, 227, 228, 243 in Sari Sakakini's sudden death of a heart attack in 1953 at the age of 39 was a devastating blow. Khalil Sakakini died three months later, on 13 August 1953. Sakakini's two daughters, Dumya and Hala, lived together in Ramallah until their deaths, in 2002 and 2003. The two sisters had long careers in education. Hala Sakakini edited her father's journals, published in 1955, and wrote two memoirs in English, Jerusalem and I and Twosome. Pedagogic career A school photograph of al-Dusturiyyeh School in Jerusalem. Khalil Sakakini is seated second from the left. In 1909, Khalil Sakakini founded the Dusturiyyah school or National School, which became known for its Arab nationalist approach. Sakakini pioneered a progressive education system: no grades, prizes or punishments for the students, and emphasis being placed on music, education and athletics. He also introduced new methods of teaching Arabic, and made it the primary language of instruction instead of Turkish. Wasif Jawhariyyeh, noted for his memoirs of early 20th century Jerusalem, was a pupil of his in the Dusturiyyah School. He praised Sakakini's education style. Sakakini led a movement to reform and change into a more Arab approach to what he considered to be a corrupt Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, and wrote a pamphlet in 1913 titled \\"The Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine\\", which led to his excommunication from the Greek Orthodox Church. Ottoman authorities arrested him on the last day of Ottoman Rule in Jerusalem in 1917, after he had sheltered a Polish-American Jew and fellow citizen of Jerusalem, Alter Levine. Both were sent to a prison in Damascus. Levine became an enemy when the United States joined the Allies of World War I. Even so, Alter Levine and Khalil Sakakini became close friends during their incarceration. Upon his release, Sakakini boarded for a brief time with Musa Alami, a former pupil, and then joined the Arab Revolt, for which he composed its anthem. In 1919, Khalil Sakakini and his wife began to work for the Educational Authority of Palestine in Jerusalem, and Sakakini was appointed head of the Jerusalem Teachers‚Äô College. He later became Inspector for Education in Palestine, a post he held for 12 years, until his resignation in protest of the appointment of a Jew as High Commissioner of the Palestine Mandate, Herbert Samuel.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 138, in After working as a school principal in Cairo, he returned to Palestine in 1926 and became a school inspector. This allowed him to bring his educational philosophy to the rural villages. At the same time, he wrote political commentaries for the newspapers al-Muqtataf, al-Hilal and al-Siyassa al- Usbu'iyya, composed patriotic poems and spoke at political rallies. In 1925, he founded the Wataniyya school, and in 1938 the Nahda College in Jerusalem. In May 1934, Sakakini built a home in the Katamon neighborhood which was completed in three years. In 1932, he sent his son Sari to Haverford College, Pennsylvania. https://archive.org/details/recordofclass1932have Views and opinions Throughout his life Khalil Sakakini embraced the European culture. Having a Greek grandmother led to an interest in Greek music and Greek philosophy. He even nicknamed himself \\"Socrates\\".Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 121, 125, in Sakakini often expressed humanistic ideas, and had a business card made out to read \\"Khalil Sakakini: human being, God willing\\". At the same time, he defined himself first and foremost as an Arab, and is hailed as one of the founding fathers of Arab nationalism of the region. He was an advocate of Pan-Arabism and envisaged Palestine united with Syria. He saw Zionism as a great threat already before the First World War and believed that the Jewish right to the land had expired while the Arab right was \\"a living one\\".\\"If we do not unite to resist Zionism, we would lose Palestine and expose others to danger\\", translated from \\"We want the country under the sponsorship of a single power, and so we will preserve our unity...The country that saves us from Zionism and from partition - that country we will prefer above all others.\\" Sakakini on preferring United States over British rule, Such Am I, O World, pp. 130, in Al-Sakakini, listing some of the punishments to be meted out: bomb and shoot the British and Jewish invaders, torch Jewish fields and orange groves, ambush routine traffic, block roads, derail trains, cut power lines. He continued: \\"The battle in Palestine is in full force... Victory is in the hands of God... If we live, we shall live with honor. If we die - we shall die with honor.Rose, Norman. A Senseless, Squalid War: Voices from Palestine 1945-1948, The Bodley Head, London, 2009. (p. 39-40). List of \\"punishments\\" quoted from Rose. During the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Khalil Sakakini applauded the Arab attacks on Jews, but worried that the violence looked bad in the eye of the public because 'the Jews controlled the newspapers and radio'. Therefore, Sakakini had to conclude, that 'the sword was mightier than the book'. For a grenade attack on a Jewish civilian train, he praised the \\"heroes\\" responsible.Sakakini diary, 10 June 13 June, 16 June 1936; 30 April, 5 May, 7 May 23 May 1936, in After the attack on Jerusalem's Edison cinema that left three dead, he wrote: > \\"There is no other heroism like this, except the heroism of Sheikh al- > Qassam\\".Sakakini to his son, 13 June 1936, in > \\"I feel the pain of the troubles, whether they fall on Arabs or on the > English or on the Jews. For that reason you will sometimes find me on the > side of the Arabs, at others times on the side of the English, and still > other times on the side of the Jews. And if there were animals who suffered > from even a faint whiff of these troubles, I would sometimes be on the side > of the animals.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 191, in Khalil Sakakini also came to believe that Nazi Germany might weaken the British and 'liberate Palestine from the Jew', and therefore supported the Nazis. He wrote that Adolf Hitler had opened the World's eyes to the myth of Jewish power, and that Germany had stood up to the Jews and put them in their place, much like Mussolini had done with the British.Khalil Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, p. 187, in Sakakini vehemently opposed allowing Holocaust survivors into Palestine, arguing that a human problem needed to be solved by all humanity. While saddened by events such as the Struma disaster, he felt that the passengers were in fact invaders. An independent Palestinian Arab government should have used force to prevent them from landing, and he felt that while elderly Jews could come to live out their last years as had happened in the past, a thriving Jewish community under British protection should be forbidden.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 203; Sakakini diary 1 March 1942 in Khalil Sakakini believed that the Holocaust was being exploited parasitically by Jews demanding a homeland in Palestine, who he said would throw the Arabs out as soon as they got their homeland. Due to the Jewish influence in the United States, he believed that their right to vote in that country should be revoked.Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 221, in Sakakini was a lifelong advocate of social reform. He tried to inculcate principles of students' liberation, sex education, socialist and other progressive ideas, and believed in free mingling of the sexes. Sakakini, Such Am I, O World, pp. 192, 194, p.156ff, 175, 148, Sakakini to his son, 12 December 1932, 7 January 1933, 12 January 1933, ISA P/378/2646 in Legacy Khalil Sakakini's published work includes educational treatises, poetry collections, literary, philosophical and political essays, and his diaries. A street and a school in Jerusalem are named after him, the Jezzar Pasha Mosque's library in Acre as well as a street in Cairo. His publications are now at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is buried in the Mar Gerges Cemetery in Cairo. In 2001, the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center successfully petitioned the municipality of Ramallah to rename the main thoroughfare nearest the center after Khalil Sakakini. That same year, the center began editing and publishing the diaries of Khalil Sakakini, which he kept from 1907 to 1952. The first volume of the projected eight volumes was published in 2003. In 2003 too, Sakakini's heirs bequeathed the center his valuable collection of publications, books, and personal effects. These are on display in the foyer of the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center.

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home ballpark of the a yet-to-be-named team in the Appalachian League, a summer collegiate baseball league. It was built in 1935 as a Works Progress Administration project, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Calfee Park was named after the mayor of Pulaski in 1935, Ernest W. Calfee. It holds approximately 3,200 people. Calfee Park is owned and operated by David Hagan and Larry Shelor, owners of Shelor Motor Mile. Calfee Park was voted the best rookie-level ballpark in America in 2019 and 2020 by a fan vote in Ballpark Digest's annual Best of the Ballparks competition. The park is set off of U.S. Route 11 in a valley within a residential neighborhood. As a result, a number of houses that surround the park have good views of games. The park had major renovations prior to the 1999 season, with a new grandstand behind the plate and along the first-base side as well as ‚Äúopen-air suites‚Äù (railed-in areas with picnic tables) farther down on the first-base line. A new scoreboard was also installed. After the Shelor ownership group purchased Calfee Park from the Town of Pulaski in 2015, over $9 million in renovations were made to the historic park. The park has received a new press box and VIP towers, renovated home clubhouse, new vising clubhouse, a jumbotron, 18 additional outdoor suites, new concession stand, upgraded souvenirs, additional general admission seating, upgraded padded club seating, renovated ticket offices, and several additional parking lots. Additional renovations since the 2015 season have included a picnic pavilion, three-tiered party deck in left field, and walk-in retail store. Renovations * Opened in 1935 * In 1999 the area behind homeplate was renovated, adding individual seats that are sold as reserved seats. There was a fairly large grandstand added to the first base side stretching from homeplate to first base. \\"open air suites\\" stretch down the first base line right along the field, past the dugout there is a deck that is sectioned off and used as box seating. There are 13 boxes stretching down the right side of the field. There was a new Concession stand and home clubhouse added in as well. * In 2009, the town added a 14th box behind homeplate and above the general admission seating. The box looks directly down the first base line. Views of left field are somewhat obstructed when in the \\"sky box\\" because of the roof above the old grandstands. Earlier in 2009 there was a new indoor facility constructed on site. It showcases two hitting tunnels that can also be used for pitching work. * The New York Yankees and the new owners of the Park announced on Sept. 9, 2014 the plan for over $3.5 million of improvements to the park for the 2015 season. The Yankees replaced the Mariners in Pulaski for 2015. * In July 2018, the Pulaski Yankees announced upcoming renovations to include the addition of approximately 675 seats and a new upper concourse along the third baseline featuring a new concession stand, additional restrooms, and a rooftop \\"party deck\\" area. The renovations will bring the main concourse sections to the same level with the new concourse providing access from one end of the park to the other. * Prior to the 2019 season, the Pulaski Yankees added a new concourse along the third-base line, a three- tiered party deck in left field, and a walk-in retail store. The party deck was named the Best Ballpark Improvement (under $1 million) by Ballpark Digest. https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/10/30/best-ballpark-improvement- under-1m-calfee-park-party-deck/ ReferencesExternal links * Ballparkreviews.com ‚Äì Calfee Park * Charlie's Big Baseball Parks ‚Äì Calfee Park * Calfee Park Views ‚Äì Ball Parks of the Minor Leagues * Stadium Journey Reviews ‚Äì Calfee Park Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pulaski County, Virginia Category:Sports venues completed in 1935 Category:Baseball venues in Virginia Category:Minor league baseball venues Category:Buildings and structures in Pulaski County, Virginia Category:Works Progress Administration in Virginia Category:Sports venues on the National Register of Historic Places Category:1935 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Calfee Park"},{"id":"2282928","text":"DeVault Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Bristol, Virginia.

Normally, the sinoatrial node (SA node) produces an electrical signal to control the heart rate. The signal travels from the SA node to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node). In an AV block, this electrical signal is either delayed or completely blocked. When the signal is completely blocked, the ventricles produce their own electrical signal to control the heart rate. The heart rate produced by the ventricles is much slower than that produced by the SA node. Some AV blocks are benign, or normal, in certain people, such as in athletes or children. Other blocks are pathologic, or abnormal, and have several causes, including ischemia, infarction, fibrosis, and drugs. __TOC__  Anatomy  Electrical conduction pathway of the heart. Normal ECG tracing for a single contraction of the heart. The synchronized contraction of the heart occurs through a well coordinated electrical signal pathway. The initial electrical signal originates from the SA node located in the upper portion of the right atrium. The electrical signal then travels through both the right and left atrium, and causes the two atria to contract at the same time. This simultaneous contraction results in the P wave seen in an ECG tracing. The electrical signal then travels to the AV node located on the lower portion of the interatrial septum. At the AV node there is a delay in the electrical signal, which allows the atria to contract and blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles. This delay accounts for the ECG period between the P wave and the QRS complex, and creates the PR interval. From the AV nodes, the electrical signal travels through Bundle of His and divides into the right bundle and left bundle, which are located within the interventricular septum. Finally, the electrical signal travels into the Purkinje fibers. The division of the signal into a right and left bundle and then into the Purkinje fibers allows for a simultaneous depolarization and contraction of the right and left ventricles. The contraction of the ventricles results in the QRS complex seen on an ECG tracing.ECG tracing in relation to normal depolarization and contraction of the heart. Red tracing indicates pathway of electrical depolarization. Blue tracing indicates resulting ECG tracing. After contraction, the ventricles must repolarize, or reset themselves, in order to allow for a second depolarization and contraction. The repolarization creates the T wave in the ECG tracing.  Diagnosis  An electrocardiogram, or ECG, is used to differentiate between the different types of AV block. In AV block, there is a disruption between the signal traveling from the atria to the ventricles. This results in abnormalities in the PR interval, as well as the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes on the ECG tracing. If the patient is symptomatic from their suspected AV block, it is important that an ECG is also obtained while having symptoms. Physicians may also order a continuous ECG (i.e. Holter monitor or implanted cardiac monitor) to monitor the patient for symptoms and conduction abnormalities over a longer period of time, as AV blocks can be intermittent. Because some types of AV block can be associated with underlying structural heart disease, patients may also undergo echocardiogram to look at the heart and assess the function. Laboratory diagnosis for AV blocks include electrolyte, drug level and cardiac enzyme level tests. Based upon clinical suspicion, the physician may do lab tests to assess for reversible causes of AV block, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatologic disorders, and infections (such as Lyme disease).  Classification  There are three types, or degrees, of AV block: (1) first-degree, (2) second-degree, and (3) third- degree, with third-degree being the most severe. An ECG is used to differentiate between the different types of AV block. Representative electrocardiogram recordings of the different degrees of heart block. = First-degree Atrioventricular Block = First-degree AV block occurs when there is a delay, but not disruption, as the electrical signal moves between the atrium and the ventricles through the AV node. On ECG, this is defined by a PR interval greater than 200 msec. Additionally, there are no dropped, or skipped, beats. = Second-degree Atrioventricular Block = __TOC__ Second- degree AV block occurs when the electrical signal between the atria and ventricles is even more impaired than in a first-degree AV block. In a second- degree AV block, the impairment results in a failure to conduct an impulse, which causes a skipped beat.  Mobitz I  Mobitz I is characterized by a progressive, yet, reversible block of the AV node. On ECG, this is defined by a progressive prolongation of the PR interval, with a resulting dropped beat (the PR interval gets longer and longer until a beat is finally dropped, or skipped). Some patients are asymptomatic; those who have symptoms respond to treatment effectively. There is low risk of a Mobitz I AV block leading to heart attack and complete heart block.  Mobitz II  Mobitz II is caused by a sudden, unexpected failure of the His-Purkinje cells to conduct the electrical impulse. On ECG, the PR interval is unchanged from beat to beat, but there is a sudden failure to conduct the signal to the ventricles, and a resulting random skipped beat. The risks and possible effects of Mobitz II are much more severe than Mobitz I in that it can lead to severe heart attack. = Third-degree Atrioventricular Block = Third-degree AV block occurs when the signal between the atria and ventricles is completely blocked, and there is no communication between the two. None of the signals from the upper chambers make it to the lower chambers. On ECG, there is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes, meaning the P waves and QRS complexes are not in a 1:1 ratio. Third-degree AV block is the most severe of the AV blocks. Persons suffering third-degree AV block need emergency treatment including but not limited to a pacemaker.  Etiology  There are many causes of AV block, ranging from a normal variant among people to the result of a heart attack. First-degree AV block and Mobitz I second-degree block are often thought to be just normal, benign, conditions in patients, and do not often result from a severe underlying condition. Mobitz II second-degree block and third-degree AV block are not normal variants, and are associated with an underlying condition. Common causes include ischemia (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle) or progressive fibrosis (excessive scaring) of the heart. It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third- degree heart block include untreated Lyme disease, hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as beta- blockers, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone, can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.  Management  Management is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block. Patients with first-degree AV block do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, and, thus, do not require treatment. Similarly, patients with second-degree Mobitz I AV block rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment. However, in some cases, patients with Mobtz I block can develop life-threatening symptoms that requires intervention. These patients often respond well to atropine, but make require temporary transcutaneous pacing or transvenous pacing until they are not longer symptomatic. Patients with second-degree Mobitz II and third-degree heart block are much more likely to have symptomatic bradycardia and hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block. Therefore, these patients often require temporary pacing with transcutaneous or transvenous pacing wires, and many will ultimately require a permanent implanted pacemaker. If the heart block is found to be caused by a reversible condition, such as Lyme disease, the underlying condition should first be treated. Often, this will lead to resolution of the heart block and the associated symptoms.

PICMG 3.0 Revision 2.0 AdvancedTCA Base Specification. http://www.picmg.org (ATCA or AdvancedTCA) is the largest specification effort in the history of the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group (PICMG), with more than 100 companies participating. Known as AdvancedTCA, the official specification designation PICMG 3.x (see below) was ratified by the PICMG organization in December 2002.Pavlat, Joe. \\"AdvancedTCA turns 10\\". CompactPCI and AdvancedTCA Systems Vol. 15, Issue 5. OpenSystems Media: 2011. http://advancedtca- systems.com/advancedtca-turns-10/ AdvancedTCA is targeted primarily to requirements for \\"carrier grade\\" communications equipment, but has recently expanded its reach into more ruggedized applications geared toward the military/aerospace industries as well.McDevitt, Joe. \\"PICMG to Expand Market and Applications for AdvancedTCA\\". PICMG - Resources. This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies, next-generation processors, and improved Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS).  Mechanical specifications  12U 14-slot AdvancedTCA shelf An AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm deep and 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover on the bottom of the printed circuit board to limit electromagnetic interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector handle (lever) actuates a microswitch to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines. The shelf supports RTMs (Rear Transition Modules). RTMs plug into the back of the shelf in slot locations that match the front boards. The RTM and the front board are interconnected through a Zone-3 connector. The Zone-3 connector is not defined by the AdvancedTCA specification. Each shelf slot is 30.48 mm wide. This allows for 14-board chassis to be installed in a 19-inch rack-mountable system and 16 boards in an ETSI rack-mountable system. A typical 14-slot system is 12 or 13 rack units high. The large AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market so the airflow goes in the front of the shelf, across the boards from bottom to top, and out the rear of the shelf. Smaller shelves that are used in enterprise applications typically have horizontal air flow. The small-medium AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market; for the lab research operation, some shelves have an open cover in order to make testing easier.  Backplane architecture  The AdvancedTCA backplane provides point-to-point connections between the boards and does not use a data bus. The backplane definition is divided into three sections; Zone-1, Zone-2, and Zone-3. The connectors in Zone-1 provide redundant ‚àí48 VDC power and Shelf Management signals to the boards. The connectors in Zone-2 provide the connections to the Base Interface and Fabric Interface. All Fabric connections use point-to-point 100 Œ© differential signals. Zone-2 is called \\"Fabric Agnostic\\" which means that any Fabric that can use 100 Œ© differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane. The connectors in Zone-3 are user defined and are usually used to connect a front board to a Rear Transition Module. The Zone-3 area can also hold a special backplane to interconnect boards with signals that are not defined in the AdvancedTCA specification. The AdvancedTCA Fabric specification uses Logical Slots to describe the interconnections. The Fabric Switch Boards go in Logical Slots 1 and 2. The chassis manufacturer is free to decide the relationship between Logical and Physical Slots in a chassis. The chassis Field Replaceable Units (FRU) data includes an Address Table that describes the relationship between the Logical and Physical slots. The Shelf Managers communicate with each board and FRU in the chassis with IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) protocols running on redundant I¬≤C buses on the Zone-1 connectors. The Base Interface is the primary Fabric on the Zone-2 connectors and allocates 4 differential pairs per Base Channel. It is wired as a Dual-Star with redundant fabric hub slots at the core. It is commonly used for out of band management, firmware uploading, OS boot, etc. The Fabric Interface on the backplane supports many different Fabrics and can be wired as a Dual-Star, Dual-Dual-Star, Mesh, Replicated-Mesh or other architectures. It allocates 8 differential pairs per Fabric Channel and each Channel can be divided into four 2-pair Ports. The Fabric Interface is typically used to move data between the boards and the outside network. The Synchronization Clock Interface routes MLVDS (Multipoint Low-voltage differential signaling) clock signals over multiple 130 Œ© buses. The clocks are typically used to synchronize telecom interfaces. Update Channel Interface is a set of 10 differential signal pairs that interconnect two slots. Which slots are interconnected depends on the particular backplane design. These are signals commonly used to interconnect two hub boards, or redundant processor boards.  Fabrics  The Base Interface can only be 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-T Ethernet. Since all boards and hubs are required to support one of these interfaces there is always a network connection to the boards. The Fabric is commonly SerDes Gigabit Ethernet, but can also be Fibre Channel, XAUI 10-Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, PCI Express, or Serial RapidIO. Any Fabric that can use the point-to-point 100 Œ© differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane. The PICMG 3.1 Ethernet/Fibre Channel specification has been revised to include IEEE 100GBASE-KR4 signaling to the existing IEEE 40GBASE-KR4, 10GBASE-KX4, 10GBASE-KR, and XAUI signaling.  Blades (boards) AdvancedTCA blades can be Processors, Switches, AMC carriers, etc. A typical shelf will contain one or more switch blades and several processor blades. When they are first inserted into the shelf the onboard IPMC is powered from the redundant ‚àí48 V on the backplane. The IPMC sends an IPMI event message to the Shelf Manager to let it know that it has been installed. The Shelf Manager reads information from the blade and determines if there is enough power available. If there is, the Shelf Manager sends a command to the IPMC to power-up the payload part of the blade. The Shelf Manager also determines what fabric ports are supported by the blade. It then looks at the fabric interconnect information for the backplane to find out what fabric ports are on the other end of the fabric connections. If the fabric ports on both ends of the backplane wires match then it sends an IPMI command to both blades to enable the matching ports. Once the blade is powered-up and connected to the fabrics the Shelf Manager listens for event messages from the sensors on the blade. If a temperature sensor reports that it is too warm then the Shelf Manager will increase the speed of the fans. The FRU data in the board contains descriptive information like the manufacturer, model number, serial number, manufacturing date, revision, etc. This information can be read remotely to perform an inventory of the blades in a shelf.  Shelf Management  AdvancedTCA Shelf manager The Shelf Manager monitors and controls the boards (blades) and FRU in the shelf. If any sensor reports a problem the Shelf Manager can take action or report the problem to a System Manager. This action could be something simple like making the fans go faster, or more drastic such as powering off a board. Each board and FRU contains inventory information (FRU Data) that can be retrieved by the Shelf Manager. The FRU data is used by the Shelf Manager to determine if there is enough power available for a board or FRU and if the Fabric ports that interconnect boards are compatible. The FRU data can also reveal the manufacturer, manufacturing date, model number, serial number, and asset tag. Each blade, intelligent FRU, and Shelf Manager contains an Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC). The Shelf Manager communicates with the boards and intelligent FRUs with IPMI protocols running on redundant I¬≤C buses. IPMI protocols include packet checksums to ensure that data transmission is reliable. It is also possible to have non-intelligent FRUs managed by an intelligent FRUs. These are called Managed FRUs and have the same capabilities as an intelligent FRU. The interconnection between the Shelf Manager and the boards is a redundant pair of Intelligent Platform Management Buses (IPMBs). The IPMB architecture can be a pair of buses (Bused IPMB) or a pair of radial connections (Radial IPMB). Radial IPMB implementations usually include the capability to isolate individual IPMB connections to improve reliability in the event of an IPMC failure. The Shelf Manager communicates with outside entities with RMCP (IPMI over TCP/IP), HTTP, SNMP over an Ethernet network. Some Shelf Managers support the Hardware Platform Interface, a technical specification defined by the Service Availability Forum.  New specification activity  Two new working groups have been started to adapt ATCA to the specific requirements of physics research. *WG1: Physics xTCA I/O, Timing and Synchronization Working Group WG1 will define rear I/O for AMC modules and a new component called the ŒºRTM. Additions will be made to the ŒºTCA Shelf specification to accommodate the ŒºRTM and to the ATCA specification to accommodate AMC Rear I/O for an ATCA carrier RTM. Signal lines be identified for use as clocks, gates, and triggers that are commonly used in Physics data acquisition systems. *WG2: Physics xTCA Software Architectures and Protocols Working Group WG2 will define a common set of software architectures and supporting infrastructure to facilitate inter-operability and portability of both hardware and software modules among the various applications developed for the Physics xTCA platform and that will minimize the development effort and time required to construct experiments and systems using that platform. A working group was formed to extend ATCA to non-telecom markets. *PICMG 3.7 ATCA Extensions for Applications Outside the Telecom Central Office The goals of this new working group are to define enhanced features to support double-wide boards; add enhancements to support 600W single-slot boards and 800W double-slot boards; add support for double-sided shelves with full sized boards plugged into both the front and rear of the shelf; and add support for 10Gbs signaling on the Base Interface.  PICMG specifications  *3.0 is the \\"base\\" or \\"core\\" specification. The AdvancedTCA definition alone defines a Fabric agnostic chassis backplane that can be used with any of the Fabrics defined in the following specifications: *3.1 Ethernet (and Fibre Channel) *3.2 InfiniBand *3.3 StarFabric *3.4 PCI Express (and PCI Express Advanced Switching) *3.5 RapidIO  See also  *AdvancedMC - expansion cards for AdvancedTCA; also can be used standalone in MicroTCA systems. *AXIe - A new modular instrumentation standard formally launched in November 2009, based on the ATCA standard.

Life He was born in Leicester. He was the eldest son of Samuel Kirby, who was a banker. He was educated privately, and became interested in butterflies and moths at an early age. The family moved to Brighton, where he became acquainted with Henry Cooke, Frederick Merrifield and J. N. Winter. He published the Manual of European Butterflies in 1862. In 1867 he became a curator in the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society, and produced a Synonymic Catalogue of Diurnal Lepidoptera (1871; Supplement 1877). In 1879 Kirby joined the staff of the British Museum (Natural History) as an assistant, after the death of Frederick Smith. He published a number of catalogues, as well as Rhopalocera Exotica (1887‚Äì1897) and an Elementary Text-book of Entomology. He also did important work on orthopteroid insects including a three volume Catalogue of all known species (1904, 1906, 1910). He retired in 1909. Kirby had a wide range of interests, knew many languages and fully translated Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, from Finnish into English. Kirby's translation, which carefully reproduces the Kalevala meter, was a major influence on the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, who first read it in his teens. Kirby also provided many footnotes to Sir Richard Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights. A short biography of Kirby, with particular reference to his work on phasmids, was published by P. E. Bragg in 2007. Evolution Kirby was an advocate of theistic evolution. In his book Evolution and Natural Theology he argued that evolution and theism are compatible. He noted that creationism was scientifically untenable and refuted its arguments. He viewed nature as a \\"vast self-adjusting machine\\".

A specialist batsman, he was occasionally employed as a spin bowler; his best bowling figures were 5 for 32 for Auckland against Central Districts at Auckland in 1973-74. Howarth played 188 matches for Surrey County Cricket Club in England between 1971 and 1985, and was the first overseas player to captain the club, which he did in 1984‚Äì85. =International= Howarth played some Test cricket with his elder brother Hedley, but most of his 47-Test career did not overlap with Hedley's. He played most of his career as a specialist batsman, captaining the team for 30 of those 47 Tests, and although his batting average of only 32 was not stunning, he did make six Test centuries. Four of those came while he was not captaining the side. In his debut series as captain, he led the side to their first Test series victory over the West Indies in 1980, when New Zealand won the first Test chasing 104 after being 73 for 8, then drew the second Test thanks to 147 from Howarth, and also survived an evenly fought third Test. =Coaching and other activities= Howarth became coach for the New Zealand team in the early 1990s and was coach of the ill-fated tour of South Africa in 1994. Now residing in England, Howarth returned to Wellington in 2012 as ambassador for the World Vintage Cricket Carnival; at that time he was coaching cricket at Haileybury School in Hertfordshire and continued to do so in 2017. Honours and awards Howarth was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket, in the 1981 Queen's Birthday Honours.

The stadium's location, just a couple of miles from the Tennessee-Virginia line, allows Gate City High School in nearby Gate City, Virginia, to rent the field for its baseball games, making Hunter Wright the home field for its Blue Devils baseball team. The facility also hosts a few home games for Kingsport's Dobyns-Bennett High School Indians, returning the favor from when the K-Mets played at the high school's field. Since 1998, it has hosted the Coca-Cola Classic, a series of baseball games between local high school teams.

Francis Hatch Kimball (September 24, 1845 ‚Äì December 20, 1919) was an American architect practicing in New York City, best known for his work on skyscrapers in lower Manhattan and terra-cotta ornamentation. He was an associate with the firm Kimball & Thompson. His work includes the Empire Building, Manhattan Life Insurance Building, and Casino Theatre. All but one of Kimball's work was in the United States. Life Kimball was born in Kennebunk, Maine. He went on to study architecture in England. In 1879 he joined forces with Thomas Wisedell, with whom he designed the 1882 Casino Theatre on Broadway, and other projects. Wisedell died in 1884. Kimball practiced independently until 1892, when he formed Kimball & Thompson with G. Kramer Thompson. That partnership ended in 1898. Kimball's Victorian Gothic Catholic Apostolic Church in New York City (1897) was praised by influential architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler as there being \\"no more scholarly Gothic work in New York.\\"G Kimball was also a pioneer in the use of ornamental terra-cotta in the United States, evident on the Corbin Building; on a striking row of townhouses that he designed at 133‚Äì143 West 122nd Street in Harlem; and on the Montauk Club in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Contemporaries described Kimball as the \\"father of the skyscraper\\". A 1917 article in The New York Times noted his bankruptcy.

The ballpark has a picnic area and a BBQ area. Field dimensions are 335 to right field, 328 to left field, 415 to center field, and 368 to each power alley. The baseball park is owned by the City of Great Falls and leased to the Great Falls Baseball Club, Inc., which is a non-profit organization. In exchange for maintaining the park and updates, the city requires that the three local high school (American Legion affiliated) teams be allowed to practice and play in the stadium as long as it does not interfere with the Minor League operations of the Great Falls Voyagers. Since the Advanced Rookie League starts late in June, this is usually not a problem.

While they have released such critically acclaimed records as United and Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, they are best known for their singles \\"If I Ever Feel Better\\", \\"Lisztomania\\", \\"Too Young\\" and \\"1901\\". History=Formation and early years= Phoenix was conceived in the 1990s when vocalist Thomas Mars, bassist Deck d'Arcy, and guitarist Chris Mazzalai, who were all friends in school, started playing together as a \\"garage band\\" based out of Mars's house in the suburbs of Paris. In 1995, Laurent Brancowitz, Mazzalai's older brother, permanently joined the band on guitar after the end of Darlin', a short-lived band that Brancowitz had formed with Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, who would later form electronic duo Daft Punk. Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on their own label, Ghettoblaster. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix quickly became well acquainted with labelmates Air when they acted as their backing band on several UK TV appearances. =United, Alphabetical, and Live! Thirty Days Ago (2000‚Äì2004)= Phoenix began releasing singles in 1999, the first of these being \\"Heatwave\\" and \\"Party Time\\", the latter of which would eventually appear on their debut album, United. The single \\"Too Young\\" was released on 22 May 2000, along with remixes of the track by Zoot Woman and Le Knight Club. \\"Too Young\\" was the band's first single to chart, reaching No. 97 in France and No. 148 in the UK. The band's debut album, United, was released on 12 June 2000. It featured the singles \\"Party Time\\" and \\"Too Young\\", with \\"If I Ever Feel Better\\" being announced as the third single from the album on 22 January 2001, and charting in several countries, reaching No. 12 in France and No. 4 in Italy. United received positive reviews, although the band did not reach mainstream success. \\"Too Young\\" was included on the soundtrack for the movie Lost in Translation (which was directed by Mars' future wife, Sofia Coppola), as well as in the movie Shallow Hal. Shortly after the release of United, Phoenix began work on a second album, recording in 2003 and 2004 and releasing the singles \\"Run Run Run\\" and \\"Everything Is Everything\\" in 2004. The band's second album, Alphabetical, was released on 22 March 2004 and saw the band reach more mainstream success, with both singles reaching some alternative rock airplay charts. French fashion designer Hedi Slimane commissioned a special mix of their song \\"Victim of the Crime\\", taken from Alphabetical, as the soundtrack to one of his runway shows for menswear clothing retailer Dior Homme. Following Alphabetical, the band toured three continents, playing 150 dates. This tour was followed up with a live album, Live! Thirty Days Ago, released only thirty days after the end of the tour. =It's Never Been Like That and Kitsun√© Tabloid (2005‚Äì2009)= After their Alphabetical tour, Phoenix spent time in Berlin during the summer of 2005, making use of Planet Roc studios to produce their third album. On 8 May 2006, the band released the lead single from the album, titled \\"Long Distance Call\\". American band Paramore would go on to perform a cover of the song live on Taratata, a French TV show. Phoenix's third studio album, titled It's Never Been Like That, was released on 15 May 2006. To promote the release of the album, Phoenix toured the United States and Europe in 2006. The album charted in several countries, reaching even greater success than Alphabetical, although it still did not chart in much of North America. It's Never Been Like That was re-released in Mexico later that year, with the so-called \\"tour edition\\" featuring four bonus tracks recorded live in Oslo from the tour. On 11 September 2006, the track \\"Consolation Prizes\\" was announced to be the second single from It's Never Been Like That. Phoenix curated a compilation album for French electronic music record and fashion label Kitsun√©. It was released on 23 March 2009, and includes music by Elvis Costello, Roxy Music, Kiss, Lou Reed and others. =Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (2009‚Äì2011)= In early 2009, around the time of the release of the Phoenix's compilation album for Kitsun√©, it was announced that the band would be returning with a new album titled Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, which would be released on 25 May 2009. The album was recorded in Paris, and was co-produced and mixed by Philippe Zdar of Cassius. \\"1901\\", a tribute to early Paris, was released on 23 February 2009 on the band's website as a free download. Due to extremely positive reviews, the song was then issued as a retail single and aired for the first time on Australian radio station Triple J. In June 2009, after the release of the album, Phoenix first appeared on the cover of the 62nd issue of The FADER publication. As the album's popularity rapidly grew, \\"Lisztomania\\" and \\"Lasso\\" were issued as the second and third singles from Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. Phoenix performing live at The Wiltern, Los Angeles in 2009 As it became apparent that \\"1901\\" was Phoenix's biggest success yet, the song was performed live on several TV shows and began to appear everywhere. \\"1901\\" was featured in the US during Super Bowl XLV in a Green Bay Packers montage, and was also performed on Saturday Night Live along with \\"Too Young\\" and \\"Lisztomania\\" on April 4.Phoenix Live performing Saturday Night in New York video Phoenix also performed \\"Lisztomania\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, \\"Girlfriend\\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and \\"1901\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix won Best Alternative Music Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards on 31 January 2010. Shortly afterwards, \\"1901\\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The album was the first Phoenix album to be certified gold and appeared on numerous \\"Best of\\" lists at the end of 2010, including Rolling Stone magazine. In addition, \\"1901\\" and \\"Lisztomania\\" were certified platinum and gold, respectively. Following the album's release, Phoenix appeared at various major music festivals, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Texas in 2009, Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California in 2010, the 2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, the Southside Festival and Hurricane Festival in Germany, the 2010 Lollapalooza, the Mile High Music Festival, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco, California, Rock Werchter 2010 in Belgium, and the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. On 20 October 2010, French electronic music group Daft Punk, composing of guitarist Christian Mazzalai's childhood friends Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, made a special appearance for their show in Madison Square Garden. AllMusic, a review website, commented favourably on the release of the album. \\"Beyond containing the band's best, most efficient songwriting, the album also stands apart from the first three studio albums by projecting a cool punch that is unforced,\\" a reviewer commented.[ Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix ‚Äì Phoenix  AllMusic] Vocalist Thomas Mars, described as \\"more bright-eyed and youthful than ever\\", is more prominent in these songs, harmonising with the instruments. \\"Maybe they've just hit their stride,\\" the reviewer said. Phoenix are the subject of a documentary From a Mess to the Masses that documents their 2009-10 tour in support of Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. The film was directed by Antoine Wagner and Francisco Soriano‚ÄîWagner was also responsible for directing the \\"Lisztomania\\" music video. The title of the documentary is a lyrical excerpt from \\"Lisztomania\\" and the total running time is 52 minutes. From a Mess to the Masses premiered in Germany and France on the Arte television network on 13 October 2011. =Bankrupt! (2011‚Äì2015)= On 5 April 2011, the band posted a blog update on their website entitled \\"Songwriting...\\" that revealed CCTV stills of a studio in which the band was working. The band stated in interviews that the album would be a departure from the pop sounds of Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and they were trying to create something more experimental. That same year, vocalist Thomas Mars married American screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola, whom he had met while producing the soundtrack to The Virgin Suicides in 1999. On 16 January 2012, the band revealed that they had completed four songs for the fifth album and it was scheduled for a late summer 2012 release, with an autumn tour. Daniel Glass, the founder of Glassnote Records, stated in relation to the material, \\"It's very hard to beat Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, but this could be revolutionary.\\" The band then updated its webpage to display the cryptic words Pluvi√¥se (until the end of March 2012), Thermidor (from April 2012) and Vend√©miaire (from September 2012)‚Äîthe words replaced the CCTV still that was published in October 2011. Pluvi√¥se, Thermidor and Vend√©miaire are three of the months of the French Republican Calendar (also known as the Revolutionary Calendar). Although the band had previously announced that a new album would be released in late summer 2012, no announcement was made about the album's release. On 16 January 2013, exactly one year after the announcement that the band had completed four songs for the album, Bankrupt! was revealed as the title of the fifth album and a teaser was released on the Phoenix website. On 12 February 2013, a redesigned Phoenix website further promoted the Bankrupt! album, with an official release date of 22 April 2013, published on the website's opening page that features an animated writing sequence. A message from the band is written by an invisible hand, while music plays and states, mostly in English, with some French: \\"Dear all, our new album, Bankrupt!, will be released the week of April 22nd. Here [the word \\"Here\\" is a link to the website page that reveals both the album cover art and the track listing] is the track listing as well as the album cover. Much love et √† bient√¥t [\\"and see you soon\\"]. Thomas Branco Mazzalai Deck.\\" The cover depicts a color drawing of a peach next to a peach slice, with a pink flower and two green leaves; the track listing included song titles such as the title track, \\"S.O.S. in Bel Air\\", \\"Bourgeois\\", and \\"Oblique City\\". Consistent updates in relation to the fifth album appeared on the band's Facebook page and, from 12 February 2013, the page reflected the aesthetic of Bankrupt!. On 21 January 2013, the page's cover photo was changed to a straightforward pink and black image in which the words \\"Phoenix Bankrupt!\\" were written in large, bold and black capital letters against a plain pink background. This cover photo was then replaced on 12 February 2013 with an image of the word \\"Phoenix\\" written in large, bold and white capital letters against a light grey background. A schedule of the major music festivals that Phoenix would perform at in support of the new album was announced and headline positions were confirmed for Germany's Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festivals, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Primavera Sound, and Lollapalooza. The band also appeared at the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, Tennessee, and appeared alongside acts such as Beyonc√© and Nine Inch Nails at the \\"Made in America\\" festival during Labor Day weekend in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 18 February 2013, the band released \\"Entertainment\\", the first single from the album. A music video for the song, directed by Patrick Daughters, was released on 7 March 2013. On 28 March, Phoenix started their 2013 tour in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and performed their first concert in two years‚Äîthe show's set list included \\"Sunskrupt!\\", a song that combines \\"Bankrupt!\\" and \\"Love Like a Sunset\\". Phoenix performed on American television during the next month‚Äîon 6 April, Phoenix was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live and performed \\"Entertainment\\" and \\"Trying to Be Cool/Drakkar Noir\\"; on 18 April 2013, the band repeated the two-song set list on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. On 22 April 2013, Phoenix played a rare London show at Shepherd's Bush Empire on the day that Bankrupt! was released. Mars entered the crowd and sang while immersed in the audience for a large portion of the show; he then climbed up cables to the first-level balcony and \\"crowd-surfed\\" his way back to the stage. In a review of the performance, music writer Josh Holliday declared: \\"And along with peace, love and understanding, what the world needs now is a band we can all believe in as one. That band is Phoenix.\\" On 6 May 2013, Phoenix were taped for the thirty-ninth season of live music television series Austin City Limits (ACL) at Moody Theatre in Austin, Texas. Mars again sang from the audience and, at the end, walked onto the mezzanine while singing and thanked the audience along the way. Terry Likona, executive producer of the show, announced that Phoenix would co-headline the two-weekend Austin City Limits Music Festival in October 2013, alongside other big acts such as Kings of Leon, Wilco, and Depeche Mode. In media articles on Bankrupt! after the album's release, Mars provided insight into the circumstances that influenced the creation of the band's fifth album: \\"At that time, we started talking about success and not music. I guess it was time to protect ourselves and focus on music again.\\" Mars made reference to the period of intensive public attention that occurred in the wake of the Grammy Award-winning Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, Phoenix's first record to achieve gold certification. Mars also reflected on the benefits of the band's belated success: \\"We're lucky that we didn't have a hit single for a while, so when we play live, people are not expecting just one song, and we don't tour as a greatest hits band, which can be sad, I'm sure.\\" In a more general sense, Mars also emphasized the importance of the live setting for Phoenix and its relationship to studio work: \\"I guess we're perfectionists in the way that when we make an album, we know it's going to last. It's important that it's exactly how we want it to be. But when the record is done, it's all about imperfection. It's all about playing live.\\" Phoenix also used the Harrison 4032 solid-state recording console, the same console used on Michael Jackson's Thriller, to mix Bankrupt!. The console was purchased on eBay and shipped to Paris. Bankrupt! debuted at number 4 on the American Billboard 200 albums chart and a Phoenix world tour was completed over a large part of 2013. Phoenix appeared in the 2015 Netflix special A Very Murray Christmas, directed by Mars' wife Sofia Coppola. The group performed a cover of The Beach Boys' \\"Alone on Christmas Day\\", with Bill Murray providing backing vocals. =Ti Amo (2016‚Äìpresent)= In November 2016, Phoenix mysteriously changed their social media themes to a television holding screen image. They also announced a series of festival appearances in Spain and France. On 4 January 2017, it was announced that they would be in a headlining spot at Governors Ball in New York City the first weekend of June, which would be their first show since 2014. In March they announced to be playing two warm-up shows on April 22 and 23 in Antwerp, Belgium. On 1 March 2017, Phoenix again updated social media, teasing new music with a 30-second clip, and announcing multiple tour dates. By 24 April 2017, the band had announced that their sixth album, Ti Amo, would be released on 9 June 2017. Three days later, on 27 April 2017, the band released the album's first single, \\"J-Boy\\" (an acronym for \\"Just Because of You\\"). This was followed by the release of the title track, \\"Ti Amo\\", on 18 May 2017 and the single \\"Goodbye Soleil\\" on 2 June 2017, a week before the album's release. Phoenix toured worldwide to promote the release of Ti Amo. The band performed residency shows in Paris, New York City, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Mexico City titled, \\"A Very Speciale Night with Phoenix\\". It featured exclusive merchandise, Phoenix vending machine, gelato (food selection varied at shows), discoteca after party, live music, special guests, and Phoenix sake. In July 2020 during a Pitchfork live stream on YouTube which re-played their 2017 Accorhotels Arena concert in Paris, the band members gave commentary to the performance as well as replied to various fan comments. The band teased that new music will be released soon, with a song already on the horizon a few weeks away. = Phoenix Sake Collection = In 2017, Phoenix collaborated with Tatenokawa, Inc., a brewery from Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, as a tribute for their late friend Toshiro Kuroda, a Japanese restaurateur who ran a store in Paris called Workshop Isse which offered food and sake from Japan. This store was on the ground floor of Christian Mazzalai's apartment building, which is how he became friends with Kuroda. During the band's Japan tour while promoting Bankrupt!, Kuroda took the band to visit sake breweries in Japan, one of which was Tatenokawa, Inc. Phoenix and Tatenokawa, Inc. created Phoenix Sake Collection, which features Tatenokawa Phoenix (also referred to as Rainbow Label) and Sparkling sake.

The portage trail crosses a drainage divide separating the West Savanna River, which drains to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, from the East Savanna River, which flows in an opposite direction to the Saint Louis River, Lake Superior and the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean. Savanna Portage was a canoe portage used by Native Americans for centuries before being used by European explorers, fur traders, Voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a vital link connecting the Mississippi waterways to the west with the Great Lakes to the east. The portage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for having state-level significance in the themes of commerce, exploration/settlement, and transportation. The park which now contains it is located north and east of McGregor, Minnesota, and approximately west of Duluth. Geology and topography The park is located on the divide between the watersheds of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, both of which drain to the Atlantic Ocean. The area is a low-relief plain which was once a glacial lakebed. During the last phase of the Wisconsinan glaciation, the deteriorating continental glacier left behind connected lakes, known as Glacial Lakes Aitkin and Upham. Formed by the retreat of the Saint Louis Sublobe of the Superior Lobe of the glacier, Lake Upham drained through Lake Aitkin to the Mississippi River. The retreating glacier and the lakes deposited sand and sediments in the lakebed. As the lakes drained these sediments became the present plain. The plain at first was drained by the Cloquet River, which then ran west to the Mississippi River. By the process of stream piracy, the smaller Saint Louis River, which runs to Lake Superior, captured the Cloquet River and most of its drainage basin. This left behind the East Savanna River which drains into the Saint Louis River, Lake Superior, the lower Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence River, and to the west, the West Savanna River, which is tributary to the Mississippi River. The old lake plain is part of the Tamarack Lowlands Subsection within the Northern Minnesota Drift Plains Section of the Laurentian Mixed Forest. Lacustrine sediments deposited by the glacial lake are parent to the present soils of peats, silt, and sand; the peats are in marshes which form large parts of the park. These wet lowlands adjoin rolling hills which are end moraines of the recent glaciation. The moraines are part of the Saint Louis Moraines Subdivision of the Northern Minnesota Drift Plain. Savanna Portage The plain in the old lakebed provided a low-grade but very swampy overland route across the divide between the East and West Savanna Rivers. Wolf Lake, source of the East Savanna River, is only about east of Savanna Lake on the West Savanna. As Wolf Lake and the upper East Savanna River are quite wet, the route selected for the portage trail departed from the river further downstream, shortening the distance to be traveled through the bog. The portage, some long, starts in the swamp and then goes west in a wooded upland to reach the West Savanna River. Long used by Native Americans, it became a thoroughfare between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley for explorers, missionaries, and fur traders. Travelers from the east exited Lake Superior near Fond du Lac (\\"end of the lake\\", or more idiomatically \\"head of the lake\\", where Duluth is now located), and ascended the steep, rocky, and difficult gorge of the lower Saint Louis River, which falls some from the location of Carlton, Minnesota, through what is now Jay Cooke State Park to its outlet at the lake. Above Carlton travelers proceeded upstream through quieter stretches to the location of Floodwood, Minnesota, where they turned southwest up the sluggish East Savanna River in the bed of Glacial Lake Upham. Coming to a small rise, the travelers commenced the portage, which in its eastern reaches was marshy, mosquito-infested, and among the most unpleasant and even tortuous of all the routes taken by the voyageurs. Struggling waist-deep through the morass of the \\"boundless swamp\\", travelers eventually reached a hardwood forest, through which the trail ran to the West Savanna River, which drains to Big Sandy Lake and the Upper Mississippi River. In times of low water, the portage was drier but the river became too shallow for canoes, so voyageurs would continue to hike overland to the northeast bay of Big Sandy Lake.Luukkonen, Larry, Between the waters: tracing the old Northwest Trail from Lake Superior to the Mississippi. Dovetail Press (2007). The portage likely was used by Europeans as early as 1679, when Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut visited a Sioux village at Big Sandy Lake during his exploration of the Lake Superior region and the Upper Mississippi River. Among the portage's users were fur traders who operated in the upper Mississippi River valley. Some went no further than the American Fur Company's large regional trading post on Big Sandy Lake operated by William Aitkin in the 1820s and 1830s, the years of peak usage of the route. Explorers and scientists crossing the portage included David Thompson, British explorer of Canada and North West Fur Company cartographer, in 1798; Zebulon Pike, early explorer of the American west, in 1805; Lewis Cass, American general and explorer, in his unsuccessful 1820 search for the source of the Mississippi River; Henry Schoolcraft, geologist and explorer, who accompanied Cass in 1820 and led an expedition in 1832 to find the Mississippi River's source; Joseph Nicollet, French geographer and cartographer of the Upper Mississippi River, in 1836; and Laurence Oliphant, a British explorer and writer, in 1854. Tourists such as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who crossed in 1863, also used the portage. When the Northern Pacific Railroad, building west from Duluth, reached nearby McGregor in 1870, the portage fell out of use for through traffic, but continued to be used for local trade and access to the interior. The trail's location was traced and marked in 1926 and in the 1940s through the 1960s, and with the use of archaeological techniques, it was more precisely marked in 1981. Most of the route is now maintained as a hiking trail. State park The interest created by investigations into the trail's route inspired creation of Savanna Portage State Park in 1961. At some , it became the third-largest park in the system. It includes within it the Floodwood Game Refuge; the park in turn is nearly surrounded by the Savanna State Forest. It is some long and nowhere more than wide, its shape dictated in part by the portage corridor. of hills, lakes, and bogs now comprise the park. Activities include summer and winter camping, hiking, snowshoeing, and ski touring on the old portage and other trails, mountain biking, and snowmobiling, as well as swimming, fishing, canoeing, and boating on Loon Lake. Flora and fauna Named for its open marshy grassland, the park's peat bogs and marshes include sedges and black spruce, tamarack, and white cedar. Uplands host a mixed hardwood and conifer forest of maple, oak, poplar, birch, white pine, and red pine. Land animals in the area include moose, black bears, deer, timber wolves, coyotes, skunks, amphibians, and wood turtles. Birds include bald eagles, sharp-tailed grouse, warblers, boreal owls from Canada which winter in the area, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans, and loons.

History In 1783, Mrs Buchan, in her late 40s and the daughter of an inn owner, declared herself a prophet and a biblical figure in her own right, and claimed to be immortal and able to give immortality to her followers by breathing on them. She gathered in Irvine, Ayrshire, a group of followers who broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan(1739-1791) to be a special saint identified with the woman described in Revelation 12.J. F. C. Harrison, The Second Coming: Popular Millenarianism 1780-1850 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1979), , p. 33. Elspeth Buchan was born in Fordyce, Banff, Elspeth Simpson daughter of John Simpson and Margaret Gordon and married Robert Buchan and hence the name. The Buchanites were expelled from Irvine, residents even threatening to drown them in the town's Scott's Loch.Irvine Times, 2011-03-16. page 14 Eventually they made their way to Closeburn (north of Dumfries) in 1784, where they prepared to ascend en bloc at short notice to Heaven. As with many controversial sects in various times and places, they were rumoured by a disapproving society to have practised behaviour that contravened social norms ‚Äì \\"a community of wives\\" or \\"orgies in the woods\\"; but there is no conclusive proof that they did either. They were expelled from Dumfriesshire in 1787 and then settled in various farms in the Crocketford area (Stewartry of Kirkcudbright) before finally settling at Newhouse in the village of Crocketford. Mrs Buchan died of natural causes in 1791, disproving her claim to immortality. The end of the Buchanite saga came in 1846, when the last \\"adherent\\", Andrew Innes, died. Innes, who lived in the (still existing) Buchanite last abode, \\"Newhouse\\", Crocketford, had expected a \\"resurrection\\" of the mummified body of Mother Buchan on 29 March 1841 - the 50th anniversary of her death. He was disappointed and died at \\"Newhouse\\" in 1846 - a death which coincided with the discovery of Mother Buchan's hidden mummified body. Many Buchanites were buried (or reburied) in a graveyard next to the north- west wall of \\"Newhouse\\", in the expectation that they would \\"ascend\\" eventually with \\"Lucky\\" Buchan. References in literature The Buchanites are remembered in Scottish literature in the works of John Galt, who was a four-year-old child in Irvine when the sect was expelled. According to Galt's autobiography, he \\"with many children also accompanied her, but my mother in a state of distraction pursued, and drew me back by the lug and the horn. [...] [T]he scene, and more than once the enthusiasm of [their] psalm singing, has risen in my remembrance, especially in describing the Covenanters in Ringan Gilhaize.\\" They are also mentioned - quite negatively - in a letter by Robert Burns: \\"[A]bout two years ago, a Mrs Buchan from Glasgow came among them, & began to spread some fanatical notions of religion among them, [...] till in spring last the Populace rose & mobbed the old leader Buchan & put her out of the town; on which all her followers voluntarily quit the place likewise, & with such precipitation, that many of them never shut their doors behind them [...] Their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon; among others, she pretends to give them the Holy Ghost by breathing on them, which she does with postures & practices that are scandalously indecent. They have likewise disposed of all life, carrying on a great farce of pretended devotion in barns, & woods, where they lodge and lye all together, & hold likewise a community of women, as it is another of their tenets that they can commit no moral sin. [...] This My Dear Sir, is one of the many instances of the folly in leaving the guidance of sound reason, & common sense in matters of Religion.\\"Letter to James Burness, August 3 1784 The Buchanites are the subject of a 1937 novella by F. L.

David Bruce Winery was founded during the revival of the Santa Cruz Mountain wine industry between the 1950s and 1970s. Bruce selected his vineyard site because of its proximity to Martin Ray and with the belief that the high elevation and mesoclimate of the area would be well suited for growing the Burgundian wine grapes of Pinot noir and Chardonnay. In 1975, British wine merchant Steven Spurrier selected 1973 bottling of David Bruce Chardonnay for his 1976 Paris tasting that would put Californian Chardonnays and Cabernet Sauvignon against their French counterparts from Burgundy and Bordeaux, respectively. While the overall Chardonnay category was won by a Californian wine from Napa Valley, the 1973 David Bruce Chardonnay placed last of the 10 Chardonnays being tasted.

They serve both to identify and embellish the building. They are also called \\"stone tablets\\" by the Rijksmuseum, which sometimes appends \\"from a facade\\". A \\"wall stone\\" is another suggested translation from the Dutch term. The content of gable stones may explain something about the house's owner and are a feature of the urban fabric of Amsterdam. Some 2,500 of these stones can still be found in the Netherlands, of which around 850 are in Amsterdam and 250 in Maastricht, while others are also found in cities such as Brussels, Lille and Copenhagen. History Gable stones came into use in the 16th century, in the days before house numbers, taking over from hanging signs as a way of simultaneously and memorably identifying and adorning a house. The tradition is alive and has moved with the times ‚Äì new stones are still commissioned, and for instance the Rabobank at Frederiksplein 54 in Amsterdam wistfully commemorates the introduction of the euro with a stone entitled De eerste en de laatste gulden (The first and the last guilder), created by Zutphen sculptor Hans 't Mannetje. In Amsterdam, many gable stones have been conserved by the Vereniging Vrienden van Amsterdamse Gevelstenen (VVAG) or Friends of Amsterdam Gable Stones. Features They normally combine a picture with an inscription, or sometimes just a date. Some illustrate the name or profession of the owner, for instance a quill pen as a badge for an author, or a ship for a sailor. Some are named after notable people (The King of Bohemia) or faraway trading destinations (K√∂nigsberg). Some stones act as talismans, quoting from holy scripture. A pious motto repeatedly found on Dutch gable stones is Nooit Volmaakt (Never Perfect), a testimony to the householder's belief that only God can achieve perfection. Going beyond practicality or superstition, some stones make a joke, usually a visual pun. For instance the \\"Batenburg\\" stone from Prinsengracht, Amsterdam, shown here puns on the words baten (to profit) and burg (castle), which together make up the name of a village near Nijmegen. A variation on the theme is a tablet bearing a biblical quotation or more worldly motto, but without an image. (Mediaeval builders also often carved mottos in wooden beams or painted them on plaster panels.) An interesting example is the Dutch-language tablet in √ñsterl√•nggatan in the Hanseatic old town of Stockholm, Sweden. It reads: :Gaet het wel men heeft veel vrinden : kert het luck wie kan se vinden :[When things go well one has many friends :If your luck changes who can find them?] Gallery Image:King of Bohemia gable stone.JPGGable stone commemorating Frederick V of Bohemia, Egelantiersgracht 153‚Äì159, Amsterdam Image:Gevelsteen In den Avden Olephant.jpgGable stone of the derelict 16th-century \\"Old Elephant\\" tavern, Petite rue de la Violette/Korte Violetstraat, Brussels Image:Gaet het wel men heeft veel vrinden.JPGDutch gable stone in √ñsterl√•nggatan, Stockholm File:Batenburg gevelsteen, Prinsengracht, Amsterdam.JPGBatenburg gevelsteen, Prinsengracht, Amsterdam See also *Gable *Gaper *Pub signs *Marriage stone *Datestone References Category:Stonemasonry Category:Ornaments (architecture) Category:Architectural elements Category:Architecture of the Netherlands ","title":"Gable stone"},{"id":"2283068","text":"Pauly Shore Is Dead is a 2003 American mockumentary comedy film directed, produced, co-written by, and starring Pauly Shore. The film is a fake documentary that begins as a semi-autobiographical retelling of Shore's early success and dwindling popularity in the late 1990s, after which it documents Shore's (fictional) attempt to fake his own death in order to drum up popularity for his films. It features many cameos. Plot The film begins as an autobiographical look at Shore's early professional successes on MTV and as the star of a series of '90s comedies. Shore's film career leads to his taking a starring role in a vehicle on the Fox Network, in which he plays the slacker son of a millionaire. The pilot of the series turns out to be a commercial and critical failure, and Shore becomes a pariah virtually overnight, with his friends distancing themselves from him for fear that it will tarnish their own careers. Shore is ultimately reduced to living in his mother's attic and watching BackDoor Sluts 9 starring his ex-girlfriend, who will no longer see him. He spends his very last $84 on a hooker‚Äîwho does almost nothing for him and his life simply gets worse and worse. One night, Shore is visited by the ghost of his mentor, comic Sam Kinison, who encourages Shore to fake his own death as a means of revitalizing popularity in Pauly Shore films and merchandise. Shore decides to go through with the plan, which initially works: Once word of his \\"death\\" breaks, celebrities eager for the residual publicity begin appearing on television in large numbers to declare Shore a comic genius and lament his early death. Shore, eager to bask in the publicity, begins appearing in public wearing a disguise; he is quickly outed, arrested, and sent to prison. In prison, Shore is attacked by one of his former fans, \\"Bucky from Kentucky,\\" a redneck whose world view was shattered when he learned that Shore had willingly put his own fans through the ordeal of thinking he was dead. Shore survives the attack, which causes him to realize that even though he was no longer as famous as he once was, he still had fans who loved him. Shore and Bucky have a heart-to-heart about the nature of celebrity, and Shore decides to start his career over. After getting out of prison, Shore sets about making Pauly Shore Is Dead to chronicle his own rise and fall, using information he has gathered from years in Hollywood to blackmail various B-list celebrities into appearing in cameos; he reserves the information he has on A-list celebrities for the planned sequel.

The genre has been credited with upending the stereotype of gaming as a sedentary activity, and promoting an active lifestyle. Exergames are seen as evolving from technology changes aimed at making video games more fun. History The genre's roots can be found in game peripherals released in the eighties, including the Joyboard, a Atari 2600 peripheral developed by Amiga and released in 1982, the Power Pad (or Family Trainer) a peripheral for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), originally released by BandaiBogost, Ian (2005).

By June 2009, health games were generating revenues of $2 billion, largely due to Wii Fit's 18.22 million sales at the time. The term exergaming entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2007. The genre has been promoted as a way to improve users' health through exercise, but few studies have been undertaken to measure the health benefits. Smaller trials have yielded mixed results and have shown that the respective traditional methods of exercise are superior to their video game equivalents. =1980s= Exergaming contains elements that were developed in the virtual reality community during the 1980s. The pioneer in this area was Autodesk, which developed two systems, the HighCycle and Virtual Racquetball. The HighCycle was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. Virtual Racquetball tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the VPL eyephones, an early head-mounted display (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.Howard Rheingold. \\"Virtual Reality\\" pp188-189 Simon & Schuster. 1991. . The first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the Atari Puffer project (1982). This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari 400/800 or 5200 system. Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar-mounted Gamepad. The machine was nearly ready for production with several games (Tumbleweeds and Jungle River Cruise) when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned. The Joyboard for the Atari 2600 was also released in 1982, by the Amiga Corporation. In Japan, Bandai dabbled in this space with the Family Trainer pad, released in 1986 for the Famicom (the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System). In 1988, Nintendo aquired the North American rights to the pad, and marketed it as the Power Pad in North America. The first exergaming system released to the market was the 1986 Computrainer. Designed as a training aid and motivational tool, the Computrainer allowed users to ride through a virtual landscape generated on an NES, while monitoring data such as power output and pedaling cadence. The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product, but was affordable by dedicated athletes. The product continues to this day, where it now runs using Microsoft Windows compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities. About the same time as the Computrainer, Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine. This has become their eRow product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in \\"indoor rowing leagues\\". =1990s= During the 1990s, there was a surge of interest in the application of \\"virtual reality\\" technologies to high-end gym equipment. Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the Exertainment System; Precor had an LCD-based bike product, and Universal had several CRT-based systems. The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising. Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users. Three issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace. First, they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics. Second, they were harder to maintain, and were often left broken. Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users, who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine. Until 1998, nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise. Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer, and the health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology. As high-performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell, manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market. In 1998, Konami's Dance Dance Revolution was released. Pump It Up (video game series), a dance game similar to Konami's, was released in 1999 by the company Andamiro. =2000s= In 2000, UK startup Exertris introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market. Exergaming came to the mass media attention at the Consumer Electronics Show when Bill Gates showcased the Exertris Interactive Gaming Bike in 2003, and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and exercise equipment. Gamercize played on PlayStation 2 The 2005 release of the EyeToy: Kinetic brought the first multi-function exergame hardware into the home market. Making the players physical movements into the game's controller. 2006 saw the launch of Gamercize, combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles. The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising, turning all game titles into potential exergames. Nintendo's Wii in 2006 brought acceleration detection with the Wii Remote. In late 2007, Nintendo released the exergame Wii Fit, which utilized a new peripheral, the Wii Balance Board. The popularity of the Wii lead to it being used in hospital \\"Wiihab\\" rehabilitation programs. The PCGamerBike appeared at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion. The Fisher- Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field. Other examples of exergaming products include: Positive Gaming iDANCE, iSTEP, Cobalt Flux Blufit, Cyber coach, NeoRacer, Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology, some Wii titles such as EA Sports Active, Cybex TRAZER, Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt, Lightspace Play Floor, PlayMotion, Yourself!Fitness, Expresso Fitness S2, i.play, Cyber ExerCycle, VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall. =2010s= The Kinect (2010) represented a significant advance in how player motion was detected in games, because the player's body became the remote. The exergaming trend within consoles that started with the seventh generation Wii peaked with the Nike+ Kinect Training (2012) & pedometer-pairing Wii Fit U (2013) games. These were followed up in the eighth generation by an exergaming push by Microsoft with the Xbox One launch day Xbox Fitness service (2013), which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the Microsoft Health. By 2017, Microsoft had pivoted away from Kinect and exergaming on consoles. In 2019, Nintendo released Fitness Boxing, and Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch, which take advantage of the Joy-Con controllers, acting as motion detectors in multiple areas of the body. In response to the lockdown stay-at-home orders of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Nintendo also published Jump Rope Challenge for the Nintendo eShop for a limited time. Mobile phone apps such as Zombies, Run! (2012), Run An Empire, Ingress (2013), and Pok√©mon Go (2016) have been described as augmented reality exergames. VR, or Virtual Reality, is now starting to become a major player in the world of Exergaming. Games like Beat Saber, Holodance, OhShape, and others allow players to get good exercise while playing a video game.  Effectiveness  Laboratory studies have demonstrated that some exergames can provide light to moderate intensity physical activity. A 2018 systematic review in the Journal of Medical Internet Research of 10 randomized trials studying the \\"Social Effects of Exergames on Older Adults\\" found that \\"the majority of exergame studies demonstrated promising results for enhanced social well-being, such as reduction of loneliness, increased social connection, and positive attitudes towards others\\". Another 2018 systematic review of 10 randomised controlled trials of exergaming in overweight children found that they can produce a small reduction in body mass index. As of 2016, exergaming for those with neurological disabilities had been studied in around 140 small clinical trials in people of all ages, to see if exergaming can help this group get enough physical exercise to maintain their health. This mode of getting exercise appears attractive in this population from a public health perspective because of its low cost and accessibility. Exergames have the potential to provide moderate intensity exercises in this population, but the evidence was too weak on long-term follow-up to draw strong conclusions. There is significant evidence across multiple random controlled trials relating exergaming to improved cognitive functioning in healthy older adults (with a mean age of 69), and attenuated deterioration or improvement in adults with cognitive impairment from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, studies investigated if exergaming can lead to improvements in cognitive performance in clinical and non-clinical populations such as those who have ADHD and depression. There are first encouraging results, but the empirical evidence still is limited. =Injury= Design trends  When making an exergaming system, the manufacturer of a consumer product must make the decision as to whether the system will be usable with off-the-shelf games or if custom software must be written for it. Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game, it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable. An example of this is Konami's Dance Dance Revolution. Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad, that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using a standard hand-held gamepad. When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging (and physically exhausting), but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller, none of the sequences are physically limited. Newer systems such as Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii use alternative input devices such as the Kinect and PlayStation Move. The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game. A specifically designed exercise game Kinetic, superimposes animated objects to be punched, kicked, or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user. The Wii and PlayStation 3 both incorporate motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes into the hand-held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game. Research projects such as exertion interfaces that investigate the design aspects of these games explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits, such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a networkBreakout for Two.

Exergame resellers have developed fitness centers and specialist room designs with programmes that focus entirely on creating environments for young people using exergaming for fitness. Group fitness programmer Les Mills International has recently launched \\"Immersive Fitness\\" studios around the globe which combine exergaming with live group fitness classes. One of the newest trends is using virtual reality immersion. VR systems have several potential advantages for athletic training; environments can be precisely controlled and scenarios standardized, augmented information can be incorporated to guide performance, and the environment can be dynamically altered to create different competitive situations.Shepherd, J., Carter, L., Pepping, G.-J., & Potter, L.-E.

Proceedings, 2(6), 214. https://doi.org/10.3390/proceedings2060214 High frame rate display technologies for example Head-mounted display can be used to transform the user into any sporting situation e.g. a track cycling veledrome. Natural movements can also be incorporated into the games, for example utilizing an omnidirectional treadmill, such as the Infinadeck. Such a system allows the user to virtually be in the game while allowing 360 degrees of movement. While the technology is new, it is showing promising results in weight management as well as in high participation rates.

Rutherford was a steady feature of the side after his return. However he had a habit of not converting fifties into centuries in Test cricket though he clearly had the ability to do so, as shown by his 35 first-class centuries. He captained New Zealand's team for three years, with two Test wins in 18 attempts in what was a difficult tenure as New Zealand struggled to find a replacement for the retired Richard Hadlee and suffered the decline in power of their only world class batsman, Martin Crowe. Arguably, Rutherford's greatest success came in One Day Internationals where he won ten matches as captain and made his highest international score, with 108 in a losing cause against India.

It is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the minor-league Orem Owlz and the Utah Valley Wolverines baseball team of the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference. Description The field was built in 2005 and holds 5,000 people. The former name of the ballpark, once disputed between the Orem Owlz and UVU, has been posted as Brent Brown Ballpark. The UVU baseball team preferred the name, while the Owlz use \\"Home of the Owlz.\\" The name of the ballpark changed on December 7, 2017 to UCCU Ballpark after Utah Community Credit Union obtained the naming rights of the ballpark for 10 years. Dimensions down the left field line quickly angles to just left of dead center which is . The right field gap is marked at and angles to down the right field line. The fence also varies in height: high down the left field line for approximately the first and then dropping to throughout the rest of the park. Though the short left and right field fences provide an advantage for hitters, the long distance to the rest of the park makes it difficult to hit home runs.

Part of the Local Group of galaxies, it was discovered by E. E. Barnard in 1884 (hence its name), with a six-inch refractor telescope. It is one of the closer galaxies to the Milky Way. It is similar in structure and composition to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is about 7,000 light-years in diameter.NGC 6822: Barnard's Galaxy APOD , NASA , 8 February 2013 Observational history  Edwin Hubble, in the paper N.G.C. 6822, A Remote Stellar System, identified 15 variable stars (11 of which were Cepheids) of this galaxy. He also surveyed the galaxy's stars distribution down to magnitude 19.4. He provided spectral characteristics, luminosities and dimensions for the five brightest \\"diffuse nebulae\\" (giant H II regions) that included the Bubble Nebula and the Ring Nebula. He also computed the absolute magnitude of the entire galaxy. Hubble's detection of eleven Cepheid variable stars was a milestone in astronomy. Utilizing the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relationship, Hubble determined a distance of 214 kiloparsecs or 698,000 light-years. This was the first system beyond the Magellanic Clouds to have its distance determined. (Hubble continued this process with the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy). His distance to the galaxy was way beyond Harlow Shapley's value of 300,000 light-years for the size of universe. In the paper, Hubble concluded the \\"Great Debate\\" of 1920 between Heber Curtis and Shapley over the scale of the universe and the nature of the \\"spiral nebula\\". It soon became evident that all spiral nebulae were in fact spiral galaxies far outside our own Milky Way. An analysis of Hubble's plates by Susan Kayser in 1966 remained the most complete study of this galaxy until 2002. In 1977, Paul W. Hodge extended the list of known H II regions in Barnard to 16. Today, there are over 150 of these regions catalogued in Barnard's Galaxy. Gallery Image:ALMA peers into the hearts of stellar nurseries.jpgComposite image from data by 2.2-meter MPG/ESO and ALMA.

A personal friend of the Shah, Nassiri participated in the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat which removed Iranian prime minister Mosaddegh from power in 1953. He was appointed head of SAVAK following the failure of General Hassan Pakravan, the previous director, to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Hassan-Ali Mansur on 21 January 1965. Nassiri was also made deputy prime minister. He served in the post until 6 June 1978 when he was dismissed by the Shah. Then Nassiri was appointed ambassador of Iran to Pakistan.

Pahlavi, also not without reason, was afraid of the growing authority of the military, especially the generals and senior officers, who became ‚Äúheroes‚Äù after the August revolution of 1953. It should be taken into account that in the period of 1950-1960s, in many countries of the region, as a result of a coup d'√©tat, the military came to power who overthrew the \\"pro-Western\\" secular regimes and established a military dictatorship. That is why the shah needed a new leader of the political police who had left the military environment and was well aware of what measures should be taken to protect the throne from usurping power from the army‚Äù.Papava V.A. \\"SAVAK ‚Äì the secret police of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (1957‚Äì1979)\\".

He was arrested together with 60 other former officials on 7 or 8 November 1978, including high-ranking officials, such as former director of SAVAK Hassan Pakravan and former Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda. When the Shah left Iran on 16 January 1979, Nassiri remained in prison until the fall of Shapour Bakhtiar's government on 11 February. On 15 February, Nassiri was arrested by revolutionists and brought to the Refah School with other officials. He was tried in a Revolutionary Tribunal along with 24 other individuals for a total of 10 hours and was charged ‚Äì without any defence or concrete evidence of guilt ‚Äì with corruption on earth, massacre of people, torture, and treason. He was sentenced to death and confiscation of property at 10 p.m. and after the sentence was confirmed by Ayatollah Khomeini, he was executed by firing squad at 11:45 p.m. On his way to the Refah School, Nassiri was injured and had to be bandaged around his head and chin.

He played for the provinces of Canterbury and Otago and is the most successful Canterbury cricket captain of the modern era.Appleby, Matthew (2002) Canterbury cricket: 100 greats, Auckland: Reed, . He was made captain of New Zealand on his Test debut and he holds the unofficial record for the most runs (70), from a single over in first-class cricket. Domestic career Germon made his first class debut as a 19-year- old for Canterbury against Auckland at Lancaster Park on 5 January 1988. Germon became captain of an underperforming Canterbury side after Rod Latham on 31 December 1990. Under Germon's leadership Canterbury went on to unprecedented success in the New Zealand one day game winning the Shell Cup 50 over competition in 1991/92, 1992/93 & 1993/94, two further wins were to follow in 1995/96 & 1996/97. Canterbury also won the New Zealand first class competition the Shell Trophy under his captaincy in 1993/4, 1996/97 and 1997/98. Canterbury also won the one off New Zealand Action cricket trophy in 1992 (Action cricket was a forerunner to Twenty20 and Cricket Max). Germon holds the records for dismissals for Canterbury with 238 in 76 first class matches. He also scored 2336 runs at an average of 30.74. Germon's final match for Canterbury was in the 1997/98 Shell Cup final which Canterbury won against Northern Districts. In this match Germon broke the New Zealand first-class record for a tenth wicket partnership when he added 160 with Warren Wisneski, making 80 runs in his final innings. Germon retired from cricket after the match, aged 29.Wisden 1999, p. 1320. In the early 1990s Germon was continually overlooked for the New Zealand side despite his wicket keeping and captaincy abilities After season 1993/94, in which Germon led Canterbury to victory in both one day and four day competitions and scored a 100 not out playing for a New Zealand XI against the visiting Pakistan side in January 1994, Germon entered the New Zealand side. =Records= *Germon captained Canterbury a record 49 times in first class cricket, surpassing Graham Dowling (43). *He finished having passed 3,000 first-class runs in his final innings.

International career While he missed out on the 1994 winter tour to England, Germon was included in the 1994/95 tour to South Africa when he was taken as cover for wicketkeeper/batsman Adam Parore. On this tour Germon made his ODI debut for New Zealand on 8 December against Sri Lanka in a rain affected match at Goodyear Park, Bloemfontein; he kept wicket while Parore played as a specialist batsman. Germon however played very little cricket on the tour. 1994/95 was New Zealand's cricket's centenary season, and it proved a disaster for the New Zealand cricket team. At its conclusion New Zealand broadcater Murray Deaker commented that the only good thing you could say about it from the New Zealand cricket point of view was that it only came once every hundred years. Marred by substandard performances, disciplinary problems and a cannabis smoking scandal, the season proved a watershed in New Zealand cricket and Glenn Turner was introduced as new coach in 1995, as New Zealand cricket sought about changing the culture within the New Zealand cricket team. Turner, upon deciding that Ken Rutherford would be replaced as captain, appointed Germon New Zealand wicketkeeper and captain, recognising that Germon had the best captaincy record in New Zealand domestic cricket at the time. Prior to making Germon captain, Turner assessed Germon's wicket keeping abilities consulting with former New Zealand wicketkeepers Barry Milburn and Ian Smith, who both considered Germon to be the best the wicketkeeper in New Zealand at that time. Former New Zealand captain and then senior squad member Martin Crowe also stated to Turner that he thought Germon as better at wicket- keeping than incumbent wicketkeeper Adam Parore.Turner, Glenn (1998) Lifting the covers, Dunedin, N.Z. : Longacre Press. Germon was to play 12 Test matches and 37 ODIs for New Zealand. Germon's captaincy career was to last less than 2 years. His first test was against India in October 1995 a match which New Zealand lost by 8 wickets. Germon distinguished himself in the match, top scoring for New Zealand in both innings making 48 and 41 runs respectively. =Captaincy= While the team did not have significant success under his leadership a steady improvement was made on the performances of the 1994 -95 season. Germon's only test victory as captain came in November 1996 when he captained New Zealand to its first test victory over Pakistan, in Pakistan for 26 years. ESPN cricinfo rates Germon's one day cricket captaincy success rate at 44.44%; this is below his successor Stephen Fleming's 48.04% success rate but represented an improvement on Ken Rutherford's 30% success rate. While New Zealand won only one ODI series, against Zimbabwe during Germon's time in charge, they did win 15 games and drew two. Germon's first one-day series in charge was against India in India and it resulted in a closely contested series win to India, three games to two. He captained New Zealand to its first ever one day victories in the West Indies in 1996 in a closely fought one day series which NZ lost three games to two. There were also series draws against Pakistan in New Zealand 1995/1996 (two all) and England in New Zealand in 1997 (two all). He led New Zealand to the final of the 1996 Sharjah Cup competition, defeating competition from new world champions Sri Lanka. New Zealand lost in the final to Pakistan. He led New Zealand to the quarter final of the 1996 world cup where despite scoring their highest ever total against Australia (to that point) with 286, they lost. Germon scored his highest ODI score of 89 in that match and finished the 1996 World Cup with a batting average of 63.66, the highest of any New Zealander and any wicketkeeper in the tournament. Along with coach Glenn Turner, Germon had wanted to make significant changes to the culture of the New Zealand team, he was faced with opposition from some high-profile players. There was much dissension in the New Zealand team in the tour of the West Indies in 1996, it has been suggested by New Zealand journalists that Chris Cairns and Adam Parore faked injuries to leave the tour early, after the tour Glenn Turner was deposed by New Zealand cricket, it is widely believed that this conflict with high-profile players along with his loss of form led to Germon's sudden dismissal from the New Zealand side in 1997. While Germon's form had slumped, (in Turner's era he had averaged 25 in ODI's with the bat, and 26.80 in tests), in his last ODI against England he made 4 dismissals, former New Zealand wicket keeper Ian Smith saying that he had \\"kept like a dream\\" in his last match.Rodrigopulle, Elmo (6 March 1997) Dropping of Germon should have been delayed, Daily News. His dismissal from the New Zealand team was highly controversial. It caused protest, especially in Canterbury. New Zealand convenor of selectors of the time Ross Dykes admitted to receiving hate mail and anonymous phone calls over the issue.Longley, Geoff (5 May 2000) \\"Dykes reflects on difficult times\\", The Press. Christchurch, New Zealand. p. 17 Germon is one of the few wicketkeepers who have played over ten tests and effected more dismissal than conceded byes.

After cricket After retiring from cricket in 1998 Germon was persuaded to play cricket again by his former Canterbury coach Denis Aberhart and former New Zealand coach Glenn Turner to play for Otago. Germon was to play for an underperforming Otago team as a batsman between 2000‚Äì2002. He chose to play for Otago citing the fresh challenge it offered him. Germon played as a batsman only and did not match his previous achievements as a player. In 1998 Germon became the South Island development manager for the Bank of New Zealand before moving on to work at St Andrew's College as its development officer in 2000. In 2004 Germon shifted to Mainland Soccer as CEO for what turned out to be only a 10-month stint before he moved to Nelson to become CEO of the Tasman Rugby Union.

It was developed by the Scottish physician John Brown and is outlined in his 1780 publication Elementa Medicinae. It drew on the theories of his teacher William Cullen, but whereas Cullen set out to create a systematic nosology of diseases, Brown argued for a unified model in which all disease was related to stimulation. Although Brown's theory never became very popular in Britain, it had temporary success in America, Italy, and the German-speaking part of Europe.  Life of John Brown  John Brown was born in 1735 and died in 1788, not very long after having written his master work, Elementa Medicinae (Elements of Medicine) in 1780. He was apparently studied to be a clergyman, but then studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and received his degree at St Andrew's. He commenced his medical practice in Edinburgh, but opposition to his new ideas, as set out in his Elementa Medicinae resulted in his move to London in 1786. Brown worked with and studied under one of the foremost medical practitioners and theoreticians of the time, William Cullen. Cullen and Brown, however, had a falling out. Brown was likely influenced by Cullen's ideas on the capacity for nerves and muscles to be excited or stimulated (similar to the work of Haller in Germany on 'irritability'), but Brown looked at the issue of excitation in a broader and more dynamic manner. One scholarly article relates the influence of Galvanism and Mesmerism on Brown's work. Brown himself relates in the Introduction to his magnum opus, Elementa Medicinae, that his ideas came from an attack of gout, but in a period when his dietary intake was less rather than more. Since the cause of gout was then held to be a problem of excess, he was put on a strict vegetable diet with no wine or alcohol for a year, but instead of the promised cure, he had four \\"exceedingly violent\\" episodes. This led him to consider the effects of different foods and drinks and try a different approach, that of an invigorating or stimulating diet which proved successful. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Perthensis, \\"Thus, from personal experience of the inefficacy of the former medical practice in the gout, he was led to review the whole old system of medicine.\\"  Elementa Medicinae and Coleridge/Beddoes  Brown's Elementa Medicinae was published in 1780 and followed several years later by Brown's own version in English. Brown did not live to see his work achieve any great acceptance, but in 1795, Dr. Thomas Beddoes, one of the leading physicians of his day, undertook a translation (claiming Brown's was deficient), accompanied by an extensive introduction to explain Brown's system. Beddoes was also a close friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and did much to introduce him to Brown's ideas as well as to the various German writings on the Brunonian system, which appeared suddenly after 1795 as well, mainly through the writings of Dr. Andreas R√∂schlaub. One source states that Beddoes' influence was \\"the most likely source\\" of Coleridge's plan to go to Germany, and that Coleridge's philosophical interests there were often \\"anchored in medical debates.\\" (Coleridge, Thomas Beddoes and Brunonian Medicine), Coleridge several times refers to Brown as a genius. :In a letter to the publishers Taylor and Hessey, of 1819, Coleridge ranked Brown alongside Cicero, Luther, Giordano Bruno, Milton, Dryden, Wolfe, Hunter and Wordsworth, as a 'man of great Genius and original Mind' (Collected Letters 4:938). Although he no longer appears in such distinguished company, during the 1790s, Brown's adherents included Immanuel Kant, J. G. Fichte and Friedrich von Schelling and, among Coleridge's immediate circle Erasmus Darwin, James Mackintosh, John Thelwall and Beddoes. This neglected strand of radical British thought from the 1780s and '90s was to play a great part in Coleridge's espousal of German Idealist philosophy.\\" Coleridge then discusses the Brunonian system in lengthy notebook entries from his time in G√∂ttingen.  Brown's ideas in Germany  While Brown's Elementa Medicinae had been known in Germany, it was not made available until 1794, when Adam Melchor Weikard, former physician to Catherine the Great of Russia, arranged for its publication in Latin after having had it brought to his attention by Andreas R√∂schlaub, a medical student (who was himself given a copy in 1793 by a friend). In 1795, Weikard prepared and published a German translation. In 1796, a second German translation, by Christoff Pfaff, appeared and a second edition in 1798 came with a critical review. R√∂schlaub had also made a translation, but did not publish (in three volumes) until Weikard's second edition went out of print in 1806 which became the standard and last German edition (the year of Hahnemann's pivotal essay on the 'elements' of his new system, On A New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs). The introduction of Brown's ideas occurred within a background both of profound natural philosophic turmoil as well as a crisis within German (and generally European) medicine (see Romantic medicine). :Inspired by Kant's critical philosophy, Fichte and Schelling were beginning to describe the relation between self and nature in new ways [although] Kant was famously ambivalent about how much we can legitimately say about the external world. He repeatedly claimed that we can have knowledge of appearances only. At the turn of the nineteenth century Brown's work suddenly gained rapid popularity in Germany and Austria, essentially through the efforts of Andreas R√∂schlaub, and Adalbert Marcus, who ran the hospital in Bamberg in northern Bavaria and worked with R√∂schlaub to implement Brown's approach clinically. R√∂schlaub developed an Erregbarkeitstheorie (excitability theory) essentially on Brunonian principles. R√∂schlaub showed that Brunonian 'excitability' was different in kind to Haller's more mechanical theory of 'Reiz' (irritability'), which was quite well-known. The difference was that Brown posited an internal excitability which is actualised by the reception of stimuli; the response to stimuli was, therefore, the combined product of the exciting stimuli and the internal excitability. Stimulation does not only come from the outside, but also triggers from within the powers of internal excitability. The emergence of Fichte's philosophy in 1794 provided another context for the reception of Brown's ideas. 'Fichte's Wissenschaftlehre is the theory of excitability', wrote Novalis, excitedly (Werke 3: 383). Fichte's account of the relationship between the 'I' and the 'not-I' found its biological correlate in the relationship between the organism and its environment. :Schelling too came under Brown's influence, and saw in Brunonian medicine the domain in contemporary science which was most suitable to the development of Naturphilosophie. However, Schelling had initially misunderstood Brown's system as mechanical, but it was R√∂schlaub who helped him to see its dynamic aspects and applicability within a science of nature (Naturphilosophie). Schelling wrote in his First Outline of a System of a Philosophy of Nature (Naturphilosophie) in 1799 that Brown was \\"the first to understand the only true and genuine principles of all theories of organic nature, insofar as he pointed the ground of life in excitability‚Ä¶He was the first who understood that life consists neither in an absolute passivity nor in an absolute capacity, that life is a product of a potency higher than the merely chemical, but without being supernatural.\\" (Schelling 1799:68) As the main historian of this period in medicine and particularly of R√∂schlaub's role, wrote: \\"This new combination of Brown and R√∂schlaub's excitability theory with Schelling's Naturphilosophie met an enthusiastic receptionand was very influential not only at the German universities but also on practical medicine.\\" Another important element was the crisis in German medicine, which came to a head in an article in a public journal by a Doctor Erhard which effectively stripped all pretense of efficacy or rationality from the prevailing 'system' of medicine.  R√∂schlaub and the Brunonian system in Germany  It was the combination of a receptive natural philosophy and science in Germany towards the end of the 1700s and the deep crisis in German medicine that provided fertile ground for the reception and dissemination of Brown's excitation theory. R√∂schlaub's main work on the Brunonian system, the Untersuchungen, setting out his and Marcus' experience, came out in 1798 and went out of print quickly, leading to a second edition in 1800. This led to the transformation suddenly of Bamberg \\"into an excellent and famous intellectual and medical centre to which students came from as far as America.\\" R√∂schlaub wrote extensively on Brown's system, in particular a journal, known popularly as \\"R√∂schlaub's Magazine\\" (Magazin der Vervolkommung der theoretishcen und praktischen Heilkunde, Frankfurt, 10 vols. 1799-1809) \\"the main forum of Brunonian medicine.\\" Brown's ideas, as presented and developed by R√∂schlaub (and Markus) met with strong resistance in some quarters. As William Osler, the renowned Canadian-born physician wrote at the turn of the 20th century: :Few systems of healthcare have ever stirred such bitter controversy, particularly on the Continent, and in Charles Creighton's account of Brown we read that as late as 1802 the University of G√∂ttingen was so convulsed by controversies as to the merits of the Brunonian system that contending factions of students in enormous numbers, not unaided by the professors, met in combat in the streets on two consecutive days and had to be dispersed by a troop of Hanoverian horse.Wilson, John L. (1999), Stanford University School of Medicine and the Predecessor Schools: an historical perspective, online book , chapter 5, section \\"Medical systems\\". One of the most prominent physicians at the time, Christoph W. Hufeland (1762-1836) was initially also opposed as it seemed to convert the basis of traditional medicine, which he favoured, but later worked to show how Brunonianism and the excitability theory were compatible and even allowed proponents of Brunonianism to publish after 1816 in his influential Journal, himself contributing articles in 1819, 1822, and 1829, now comparing Brown with Galen. = Repression = There was a renewal at this time of interest in the Brunonian system due to the popularity of the French physician Broussais, whose theory was ostensibly based on Brown's system, but rather emphasized the negative side (lowering of energy through blood-letting). However, this renewal was cut short by the assassination on 23 March 1819 of August von Kotzebue, a major literary and conservative political figure, by a radical student. The result was the shutting down by Metternich of all liberal journals, schools and student unions- \\"for medicine, this meant a general return to traditionalism and eclecticism.\\" The 1840s saw a reaction to this repression and an attack on \\"intellectual barren medical eclecticism\\" with a call for a return to the ideas of Romantic medicine. Carl Wunderlich, the founder of thermometry in Germany, saw Brown and R√∂schlaub as the genesis of the new \\"physiological medicine\\" school of which he was a proponent. In 1846, a German doctor and historian, Bernard Hirschel, published a very favourable study of Brunonianism and listed all the relevant literature, \\"which remains the best compilation on this subject\\" Historiography misrepresented, then denounced, and finally totally ignored R√∂schlaub.  Influence on Western medicine  Current science-based Western medical practice does not accept nineteenth century notions of \\"excitability\\".\\"the central idea of excitability cannot be more than an explanatory challenge. It remains one of the possibilities that scientific medicine, today totally based on reductionism, cannot accept.\\" (page 73) Although the direct influence of the Brunonian system seemed to end about the mid-1800s its influence, in the form of \\"the idea of an active, self-reproducing and self-defending power mediating the organism's general reaction has, since then, never ceased to resonate in German medical thinking. This can be seen in Rudolf Virchow, especially when he was trying to formulate the general principles of cellular pathology.\\" Though Virchow tried to downplay it, his approach and ideas owed much to R√∂schlaub's work with Brown's ideas. One of Brown's key ideas was that of the unity of pathology and physiology, the former being an unhealthy departure from the natural rhythms and functions of the latter. This was a major idea taken over by Virchow, but he claimed it as new (the degree to which Virchow borrowed from the Brunonian system through the works of R√∂schlaub is documented in the major work by Nelly Tsouyoupoulos which is available only in German).

Early life and career  The son of a colonel in the Prussian Army, M√ºller was born in Hanover. After attending gymnasia at Hanover and Kiel, he entered the military academy at Pl√∂n in Schleswig-Holstein, but transferred to the German Imperial Navy at Easter 1891. He served first on the training ship , then on the training ship on a voyage to the Americas. He became signal lieutenant of the old ironclad in October 1894, and later transferred in the same capacity to her sister ship . M√ºller was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See and posted to the unprotected cruiser . During Schwalbes deployment to German East Africa, he caught malaria, which troubled him for the remainder of his life. After returning to Germany in 1900, M√ºller served on shore before becoming second gunnery officer of the pre-dreadnought battleship . An appointment to the staff of Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia proved to be the turning point to career success. After receiving high praise and assessments from his superiors, he was promoted to the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n in December 1908, and assigned to the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) in Berlin, where he impressed Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.  In command  As a reward for his admiralty work in Berlin, M√ºller was given command of the light cruiser in the spring of 1913. Soon he achieved fame and notoriety in both the German and other imperial powers' newspapers for initiative and skill in shelling rebellious forts along the Yangtze, at Nanking. He was awarded the Order of the Royal Crown (Third Class) with Swords. At the outbreak of the First World War, Emden was anchored in the German base at Tsingtao. She steamed out to sea on the evening of July 31, 1914, and on August 4 she intercepted and captured the Russian mail steamer Ryazan, the first prize taken by the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) in the Great War. Emden then made rendezvous with the German East Asia Squadron of Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee in the Mariana Islands. It was during a conference on the island of Pagan that M√ºller proposed a single light cruiser of the squadron be detached to raid Allied commerce in the Indian Ocean, while the remainder of Spee's squadron continued to steam east across the Pacific. M√ºller and Emden were given the assignment. In the following twelve weeks Emden and M√ºller achieved a reputation for daring and chivalry unequaled by any other German ship or captain. M√ºller was highly scrupulous about trying to avoid inflicting non-combatant and civilian casualties. While taking fourteen prizes, the only merchant sailors killed by Emdens guns were five victims of a bombardment of Madras that targeted British oil tanks and a merchant ship, despite the care M√ºller had taken to establish lines of fire that would minimise the risk of hitting civilian areas of the city. Emden also sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet during a raid on Penang in Malaya. Thirty-six French survivors from Mousquet were rescued by Emden, and when three men died of their injuries they were buried at sea with full honours. The remaining Frenchmen were transferred to a British steamer, Newburn, which had been stopped by the German ship, but not attacked, so as to enable them to be transported to Sabang, Sumatra, in the neutral Dutch East Indies.  Defeat and captivity  When Emden sent a landing party ashore to destroy a radio station at Port Refuge in the Keeling Islands on November 8, 1914, she was finally cornered by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney and was defeated in the Battle of Cocos by the Australian ship's heavier guns. M√ºller, with the rest of his surviving crew, was captured and taken to Fort Verdala, Malta. A detachment of his crew which had gone ashore evaded capture and escaped to Germany under the leadership of Emdens first officer, Hellmuth von M√ºcke. On October 8, 1916, two days after the German resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, M√ºller was separated from the rest of the Emden prisoners and taken to England, where he was interned at a prisoner of war camp for German officers located at the Midlands Agricultural and Dairy College (now the Sutton Bonington Campus of the University of Nottingham). In 1917 he led an escape of 21 prisoners through a tunnel, but was recaptured. The climate of England disagreed with his malaria, and he was eventually sent to the Netherlands for treatment, as part of a humanitarian exchange of prisoners. In October 1918, a month before the armistice, he was repatriated to Germany. Kapitan v. M√ºller Street in Hanover  Final years  M√ºller was awarded the Pour le M√©rite (or Blue Max) and finally promoted to Kapit√§n zur See. In early 1919, he retired from the Navy on grounds of ill health and settled in Blankenburg. He politely refused to write a book detailing his war service and exploits. He was elected to the state parliament of the Free State of Brunswick on an anti-class platform as a member of the German National People's Party. He died at Brunswick suddenly, probably weakened by frequent malarial bouts, on March 11, 1923.

Its first regular season baseball game occurred on May 11, 2005, in which the Lancaster Barnstormers lost to the Atlantic City Surf, 4-3. The ballpark also hosts the Lancaster New Era Tournament for midget baseball and the Lancaster-Lebanon League high school baseball championship, and was the site of the 2008 Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference baseball championship. In October 2008, the venue hosted vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, for the Road to Victory rally during the 2008 United States presidential election. Clipper Magazine Stadium was honored as the \\"Ballpark of the Year\\" by the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball following the end of its 2013 regular season. The award commemorated Barnstormers' staff for their excellence in groundskeeping and stadium operations. Clipper Magazine Stadium also serves as the corporate headquarters for the Atlantic League. The ballpark is named for Clipper Magazine, a local periodical company, which purchased the naming rights for $2.5 million over ten years. This agreement was extended in 2013 through the 2019 season. Based on fan voting on BallparkDigest.com, Clipper Magazine Stadium was voted Best of the Ballparks for independent-baseball parks in 2020.  History  Forty-four years before the opening of Clipper Magazine Stadium and the Lancaster Barnstormers' inaugural season, the Lancaster Red Roses entertained baseball enthusiasts for 20 years at Stumpf Field. Efforts for a new stadium and a new team began in 1987, and what was a long sixteen-year battle finally paid off with an announcement in 2003. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agreed to fund roughly half of the cost with Opening Day Partners and the city of Lancaster covered the remainder. The original plan in 2001 called for a proposed, $20-million ballpark to be constructed on the Diseley Farm site, across from Long's Park in Manheim Township. However, those plans were cancelled because of residential concerns about traffic and political concerns about the use of eminent domain and rezoning.Diseley Farm ballpark After this plan was terminated, most Lancaster County politicians preferred a downtown ballpark in order to revitalize a neighborhood. The Redevelopment Authority of the County of Lancaster settled on an industrial site on the corner of North Prince and Frederick streets, where a company called Ace Rents existed. Initially, Ace Rents stalled the process, but quickly came to an agreement as they did not want to cause delay.Aces Rents relocated The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 28, 2004, and Clipper Magazine Stadium was finished just before it opened on May 11, 2005. With its brick fa√ßade and steel beams, the architecture of Clipper Magazine Stadium alludes to its industrial surroundings. Located in Lancaster's Northwest Corridor, the ballpark faces many downtown factories and is constructed over a former rail yard.Clipper's architecture Coincidentally, this section of Lancaster city (between North Mary and North Charlotte Streets, south of the Harrisburg Pike) was historically known as the \\"base ball ground\\", circa 1886. =2007 Atlantic League All-Star Game= In July 2007, the Lancaster Barnstormers hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game at Clipper Magazine Stadium. The league's former North Division won, 8-6.2007 All-Star Game Ballpark attractions Clipper Magazine Stadium includes 6,000 green, chair-back seats in two levels divided by an open, 360-degree concourse. It also features other seating options such as luxury suites with professional catering, lawn seating that expands the ballpark's seating capacity to 7,500, and bleachers along the left-field wall. Additionally, the venue includes a Kid's Park with a birthday zone, a carousel, jungle gyms, a rock climbing wall, and various inflatables. Cylo's Clubhouse allows for youth to interact with the Barnstormers' bovine mascot, Cylo. Behind Section 13, the stadium features the Little Sluggers Dugout, an enclosed area for nursing mothers with a toddler play area and a television. The local Subaru dealer sponsors an outdoor area complete with Bocce Ball, corn-hole, a life-size Jenga, shuffleboard, ping pong, giant checkers, and a dog kissing booth, and a barbershop corner. The area also features the Broken Bat Craft Beer Deck, which features a wide variety of Central Pennsylvania craft beer choices. The Inside Corner Team Store is the official Lancaster Barnstormers' team apparel and souvenir store. It is located at the home-plate entrance and open year- round. The Picnic Pavilion features a traditional ballpark menu with an emphasis on items produced in Lancaster County. This emphasis includes Hess's BBQ (a four-time Pennsylvania state barbecue champion), Philly Pretzel Factory soft pretzels, Kunzler hot dogs, beer from the Lancaster Brewing Company, and Turkey Hill ice cream and iced tea. Other regional foods provided at Clipper Magazine Stadium include cheesesteaks and whoopie pies. Next to the Picnic Pavilion is an area with grass and picnic tables simply called \\"The Backyard.\\" Aside from the entertainment options, the venue depicts Lancaster's professional baseball history with a visual display, to include a mural honoring Richard M. Scott. Scott was a former Lancaster mayor (1974‚Äì1979) who initiated the civic effort toward Clipper Magazine Stadium. Infield at Clipper Magazine Stadium Before the 2013 Atlantic League season, the Lancaster Barnstormers made a series of improvements to Clipper Magazine Stadium. The first of these was a new playground for children along the third-base line featuring a foam-based protective floor. Other improvements included a renovated picnic area with new tents and a deck comprising synthetic materials instead of wood, a new right-field wall, landscaping beyond the outfield, and computerized irrigation controls. =Home Run Harbor= Home Run Harbor, a 36,000-gallon, artificial pond with 10 bumper boats equipped with water cannons, a small waterfall, and a bridge was added prior to the 2008 season. An estimated 30% of the home runs at the ballpark are hit toward the Home Run Harbor area, making the location a great place to see long-ball action. Safety netting prevented incoming baseballs from injuring patrons of the attraction. The bumper boats attraction was closed after the 2015 season. =Silverball Museum Arcade= The Lancaster Barnstormers added the Silverball Museum Arcade in time for the 2011 Atlantic League season. It is a coin-free attraction that includes nostalgic arcade games from the 1930s to some of the video games played in the present. Each machine possesses a description of its history and inspiration. The Silverball Museum Arcade also has televisions and multimedia detailing everything pinball. =Stitches Sculpture= In late 2012, an artist named Derek Parker installed his baseball stitches sculpture along Clipper Magazine Stadium's main walkway on North Prince Street. It symbolically links the ballpark to Lancaster city. As the sixth Poetry Paths project completed by Franklin & Marshall College's Writer's House, the stitches also tie professional baseball and the arts. It includes the Le Hinton poem called \\"Our Ballpark\\" and is part of a $250,000 initiative by the Lancaster County Community Foundation to add art and poetry into Lancaster city's urban environment.

Using state-of-the art equipment, the right field segment of the ballpark is converted to an ice skating rink measuring 135 feet by 85 feet with skate rental available; the concessions serve ballpark fare as well as soup, coffee, and hot chocolate. In 2010, a 26-foot Ice Slide attraction by Avalanche Express was added to the Ice Park. =LeSean McCoy Celebrity Softball Game= In 2012, the Barnstormers held its first annual celebrity softball game, which was hosted by LeSean McCoy, an All-Pro running back on the Philadelphia Eagles and Harrisburg native. The contest pits the Eagles against professional football players from other teams in the National Football League. The 2012 Eagles roster featured Brent Celek, Hugh Douglas, DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Torrey Smith, Michael Vick, and Brian Westbrook. Their opponents included Victor Cruz of the New York Giants, Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Hakeem Nicks of the New York Giants, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens, and Mike Wallace of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Any proceeds collected for the LeSean McCoy Celebrity Softball Game are directed to the LeSean McCoy Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that serves to raise funds and awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. LeSean McCoy is motivated by his grandmother's death due to ALS. Additionally, the Foundation also provides for the underprivileged in Central Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. Some of the money collected from the 2012 game provided Christmas toys to the Boys and Girls Club and the Salvation Army, sports gear to the Police Athletic League, a professional football game and a winter vacation for families affected by ALS, winter coats and backpacks containing necessary school supplies for impoverished children, and winter coats for a women's and children's shelter in Philadelphia. =Concerts= Clipper Magazine Stadium has hosted various concerts, including rock musicians Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, and Jefferson Starship; country music artists Clint Black, Dwight Yoakam, and Willie Nelson; and smooth jazz instrumentalist Kenny G. =Soccer= On July 16, 2009, Clipper Magazine Stadium hosted an exhibition match between the Harrisburg City Islanders and Crystal Palace, an English team based in London. The ballpark's infield was covered with grass sod in order to convert it for the game. Additionally, local soccer training was scheduled at Clipper Magazine Stadium to maximize the soccer pitch's use. In August 2015, the venue hosted two professional soccer games. The first featured the Harrisburg City Islanders versus FC Montreal, both members of the United Soccer League. The second match included the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer club, versus Harrisburg. For the 2016 season, the Harrisburg City Islanders played 5 regular season games at Clipper Magazine Stadium.

Eurostar trains began operating on 14 November 1994, with EPS, NMBS/SNCB and SNCF were each responsible for the running of Eurostar services in their own territory. On 1 April 1994, EPS signed a fixed-rate track access contract with Railtrack lasting until 29 July 2052 as part of the plans for Regional Eurostar services.

The company was renamed Eurostar (UK) Limited (EUKL) and was to use the income from EUKL to help finance the HS1 project. Following financial assistance from the government in 1998, LCR was forced to appoint a management contract for EUKL. Bids for the contract were submitted by Virgin Rail Group and Inter- Capital and Regional Rail, a consortium of National Express (40%), SNCF (35%), NMBS/SNCB (15%) and British Airways (10%).

Bosmont is located in Region 4. Bosmont is located in the West Rand of Johannesburg and nearly all of its residents are Coloured. History It was during the sixties that people of colour were forced to move from areas such as Albertsville, Vrededorp (Fietas) and other areas in and around the inner city to be settled in new designated areas such as Bosmont and Eldorado Park. The name of this suburb - BOSMONT is derived from the fact that the street names are named after South African trees of bushes (Bos in Afrikaans, one of the local languages) and Mont (short for Mountain). This has been contracted into Bosmont. Streets running in one direction are named after trees Eg Olywenhout Street. Streets running perpendicular to them are named after mountains Eg. Soutpansburg Str. As a result of the Group Areas Act, the Coloured people were forcibly relocated from 1962 to 1974 since Vrededorp was declared a European township in 1936. The land for the suburb was proclaimed in June 1954. The township Bosmont and New Monteleo were joined together under the same name Bosmont in 1962. Bosmont was incorporated into the Johannesburg municipal area and developed by the Department of Community Development for Coloured People. By June 1962, residents started occupying homes in Bosmont. Bosmont used to enjoy and is still enjoying considerable prestige as an elite suburb in the eyes of the Coloured community and houses there are sought after by those who can afford them. A significant difference between Bosmont and other predominantly Coloured areas is its large concentration of Cape Malay Coloureds (the largest Cape Malay culture in Johannesburg). Due to this, Islam has become a prominent feature in Bosmont and it also exists in complete peace and harmony with other faiths such as Christianity and Hinduism, however Christianity still remains as the largest religion in Bosmont. Religion Churches in Bosmont include: *Bosmont Congregational Church *Calvary Baptist Church *Evangelical Bible Church Bosmont *New Apostolic Church *St Joseph the Worker Catholic Church *St Luke's Anglican Church *IAG Bethel Assembly *AFM Eagles Wings *New Life Baptist Church The majority of Muslims in Bosmont follow the Shafi Madhab. This too is unique in that the majority of Muslims in the Gauteng province of (who are mostly Indian) follow the Hanafi Madhab. Leaders in churches and mosques play a big role in uniting the community to fight crime, drugs, etc. Education Bosmont is home to four government schools (C.J. Botha High, R.W. Fick High, G.R. Harris Primary and Bosmont Primary) and two private schools (Bosmont Muslim School and St Barnabas High School). Recreational activities are the Bosmont library, various sports grounds (soccer, cricket, basketball and tennis) and the BFA Soccer Stadium. Sport and recreation Bosmont has a number of soccer teams, including Aston Villa, Rangers, Universals and Dazzlers. Dazzlers Football Club is the most well-known and popular soccer team from Bosmont. Dazzlers was founded in the South African winter of 1949 in Albertville, Johannesburg, South Africa by Wilfred, ‚ÄòWillie‚Äô, Mooi and his cousin, Clifford Jousten. Dazzlers Football Club originated with a comic book. Frank Stuart Pepper wrote a comic strip called ‚ÄòDanny of the Dazzlers‚Äô which started appearing in ‚ÄòThe Champion‚Äô in 1948 and continued until the magazine's demise in 1955. Dazzlers FC played under the TIFA (Transvaal Independent Football Association) which represented Coloured, Indian and African football clubs. Other activities can be found at the Bosmont Recreation Centre (Ward 82). Activities include Bosmont Clinic, Bosmont Alcoholics Anonymous, Cancer support, Children's afternoon free play, Church groups, Crime forum, Hall hire, Holiday programme, Karate, Modern dance, Senior citizens group, Table tennis, Youth Club Bosmont also has Chinese, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Tamil sections in the Bosmont Cemetery.

It lies west of Limavady on the main Derry to Limavady A2 road and is east of Derry. It is designated as a Large Village and in 2011 the population of Ballykelly was 2,107. It lies within Causeway Coast and Glens district. Features Ballykelly contains some of the most interesting buildings erected in Ulster by the Plantation companies, being largely developed by the London Company of Fishmongers through the 18th and 19th centuries. It features Tamlaghtfinlagan Parish Church, built by Earl Frederick Hervey, 18th-century Bishop of Derry, amongst many traditional buildings. The Presbyterian Church, Drummond Hotel and North West Independent Hospital, were all built by the London Company of Fishmongers. The village enjoys views across Lough Foyle to Inishowen in County Donegalhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/londonderry/ballykelly_village.shtml and is bordered by Ballykelly Forest which was the first State Forest in Northern Ireland. Although there are good health and educational facilities available, there is only a limited retail sector relative to the population of the village. Politics The village lies within the East Londonderry constituency and is represented by Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member, Gregory Campbell. History The village was originally laid out as a Plantation settlement. The development of the nearby World War II airfield greatly enhanced the size and significance of the village. There has been considerable expansion throughout the post-War period, particularly since the 1990s, with a series of private residential developments west of the historic core along Clooney Road. RAF Ballykelly opened in 1941 as an airfield RAF Coastal Command and closed in 1971, because of the British Government's defence cuts. The station was transferred to the British Army, who renamed it Shackleton Barracks. The Army was due to leave Shackleton Barracks in early 2008. During World War II an RAF bomber aeroplane on a training run clipped a telephone line behind a church in Ballykelly and crashed, claiming the lives of the crew. The aircraft was carrying out a trials mission involving low level parachuting, but a parachute became entangled with the tailplane, putting the aircraft out of control. During the Northern Irish Troubles the Droppin Well bombing occurred in Ballykelly, killing 17 people in a local disco and bar. Although one of the most fatal single incidents of the conflict, it was the only fatal Troubles-related incident to take place in Ballykelly. Places of interest Sampson's Tower *Ballykelly Forest is located west of the village. Also known as the Camman Wood, it was a popular haunt for highwaymen terrorising the coach road from Coleraine to Derry. The land was purchased in 1910 and it became the first state forest in Northern Ireland, with the planting of of Douglas fir commencing in 1912. It now has walking trails. *Between Limavady and Ballykelly is Rough Fort, one of the best preserved earthworks in the province. It covers approximately was one of the first properties to be acquired by the National Trust in Northern Ireland. *Nearby is Sampson's Tower, a fortified structure built by public subscription in memory of Arthur Sampson who for 40 years was an agent of the London Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. *The village hosts Shackleton Barracks, which became famous when a commercial airliner on a Ryanair service landed there by mistake on 29 March 2006, instead of at City of Derry Airport. *Behind the Kings Lane Estate there are the remains of the Lough Shore Base Line trigpoint. This is one of three towers created to verify a mapping baseline for Ireland. , Demography Ballykelly is classified as a village by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e., with a population of between 1,000 and 2,250 people). On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 2,107 people living in Ballykelly. Of these: *23.26% were aged under 16 and 9.63% were aged 65 and over *50.17% of the population were male and 49.83% were female *58.33% were from a Catholic background and 38.59% were from a Protestant or other Christian background *8.55% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were unemployed.  Climate  Ballykelly has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild summers and cool winters. Transport *Ballykelly has good road links to Derry and Limavady. A proposed Ballykelly by-pass would, when constructed, provide a single carriageway road taking the bulk of through traffic away from the village. Construction is now \\"on hold until 2020\\". *The City of Derry Airport is to the west. *The Broharris Canal was constructed in the 1820s when a long cut was made on the south shore of Lough Foyle near Ballykelly in the direction of Limavady. It served both as a drainage channel and for transport with goods being brought from Londonderry Port, as well as shellfish and kelp from the sand banks along the shore. *Ballykelly railway station opened on 29 December 1852 and closed on 20 September 1954. There are currently no rail links serving Ballykelly, although the Derry to Belfast railway line runs nearby. Sport *Gaelic football is played at Glack GAC which encompasses players from Ballykelly and the Glack area. *Camogie is also played at Glack GAC for ladies. *The Nedd CC is the local cricket team in Ballykelly, and currently play in Senior League 2 of the North West Cricket Union. Education *Ballykelly Primary School *St. Finlough's Primary School, Glack, Ballykelly Religion Ballykelly Presbyterian Church, built 1827. The Anglican parish of Tamlaghtfinlagan originally was located southwest of the current village. The village is recorded in Papal Bulls of the mid-12th century. The name Tamlaghtfinlagan comes from the Irish for \\"the resting place of Finliganus\\", one of Columba's monks who was, according to tradition, the founding abbot of the abbey. This abbey building still exists, although in ruins. In the mid-16th century the parish church moved to Walworth. In 1689 it was gutted by the retreating troops of James II following the defeat in the Battle of the Boyne. The current edifice was dedicated in 1795, and is a simple perpendicular church, with three aisles, a small chancel and a gallery, much of which was built by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. *Ballykelly Presbyterian Church was built in 1827 by the Fishmongers Company, London and is a listed grade A building. It has a growing congregation of over 240 families. *Saint Finlough's Catholic Church dates from 1849. ReferencesExternal links *BBC Your Place and Mine: Ballykelly, Co.

At the age of six, he was sent to Paris to stay with his maternal grandmother.Sarane Alexandrian: French art historian, poet and right-hand man to Andr√© Breton, The Independent obituary Literary career Alexandrian's initiation to Dada and surrealism came in the summer of 1943 when, aged 16, he met Raoul Hausmann who was staying in Peyrat-le-Ch√¢teau near Limoges as a refugee. From 1947, he served as the last secretary of Andr√© Breton and became an essential figure of the surrealist current. Alexandrian was an advocate of the philosophy Nietzsche advanced in The Gay Science (Die fr√∂hliche Wissenschaft). He headed the journal Sup√©rieur Inconnu (a title provided by Breton), which exalts four values shared by the surrealists and Alexandrian: dreams, love, knowledge, and revolution. Catherine Millet is one notable contributor to the magazine. Alexandrian was a friend of Victor Brauner, and remained an admirer of Charles Fourier, and an ardent defender of Mata Hari.

Electron microscopy images of M3N@C80 peapods. Metal atoms (M = Ho or Sc) are seen as dark spots inside the fullerene molecules; they are doubly encapsulated in the C80 molecules and in the nanotubes. Endohedral fullerenes, also called endofullerenes, are fullerenes that have additional atoms, ions, or clusters enclosed within their inner spheres. The first lanthanum C60 complex was synthesized in 1985 and called La@C60. The @ (at sign) in the name reflects the notion of a small molecule trapped inside a shell. Two types of endohedral complexes exist: endohedral metallofullerenes and non-metal doped fullerenes. Notation In a traditional chemical formula notation, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) with an atom (M) was simply represented as MC60 regardless of whether M was inside or outside the fullerene. In order to allow for more detailed discussions with minimal loss of information, a more explicit notation was proposed in 1991, where the atoms listed to the left of the @ sign are situated inside the network composed of the atoms listed to the right. The example above would then be denoted M@C60 if M were inside the carbon network. A more complex example is K2(K@C59B), which denotes \\"a 60-atom fullerene cage with one boron atom substituted for a carbon in the geodesic network, a single potassium trapped inside, and two potassium atoms adhering to the outside.\\" The choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically (the at sign is included in ASCII, which most modern character encoding schemes are based on), and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene. Endohedral metallofullerenes Doping fullerenes with electropositive metals takes place in an arc reactor or via laser evaporation. The metals can be transition metals like scandium, yttrium as well as lanthanides like lanthanum and cerium. Also possible are endohedral complexes with elements of the alkaline earth metals like barium and strontium, alkali metals like potassium and tetravalent metals like uranium, zirconium and hafnium. The synthesis in the arc reactor is however unspecific. Besides unfilled fullerenes, endohedral metallofullerenes develop with different cage sizes like La@C60 or La@C82 and as different isomer cages. Aside from the dominant presence of mono-metal cages, numerous di-metal endohedral complexes and the tri-metal carbide fullerenes like Sc3C2@C80 were also isolated. In 1999 a discovery drew large attention. With the synthesis of the Sc3N@C80 by Harry Dorn and coworkers, the inclusion of a molecule fragment in a fullerene cage had succeeded for the first time. This compound can be prepared by arc-vaporization at temperatures up to 1100 ¬∞C of graphite rods packed with scandium(III) oxide iron nitride and graphite powder in a K-H generator in a nitrogen atmosphere at 300 Torr. Endohedral metallofullerenes are characterised by the fact that electrons will transfer from the metal atom to the fullerene cage and that the metal atom takes a position off-center in the cage. The size of the charge transfer is not always simple to determine. In most cases it is between 2 and 3 charge units, in the case of the La2@C80 however it can be even about 6 electrons such as in Sc3N@C80 which is better described as [Sc3N]+6@[C80]‚àí6. These anionic fullerene cages are very stable molecules and do not have the reactivity associated with ordinary empty fullerenes. They are stable in air up to very high temperatures (600 to 850 ¬∞C). The lack of reactivity in Diels- Alder reactions is utilised in a method to purify [C80]‚àí6 compounds from a complex mixture of empty and partly filled fullerenes of different cage size. In this method Merrifield resin is modified as a cyclopentadienyl resin and used as a solid phase against a mobile phase containing the complex mixture in a column chromatography operation. Only very stable fullerenes such as [Sc3N]+6@[C80]‚àí6 pass through the column unreacted. In Ce2@C80 the two metal atoms exhibit a non-bonded interaction. Since all the six-membered rings in C80-Ih are equal the two encapsulated Ce atoms exhibit a three-dimensional random motion. This is evidenced by the presence of only two signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum. It is possible to force the metal atoms to a standstill at the equator as shown by x-ray crystallography when the fullerene is exahedrally functionalized by an electron donation silyl group in a reaction of Ce2@C80 with 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1,2-disilirane. Gd@C82(OH)22, an endohedral metallofluorenol, can competitively inhibit the WW domain in the oncogene YAP1 from activating. It was originally developed as a MRI contrast agent. Non-metal doped fullerenes Martin Saunders in 1993 produced endohedral complexes He@C60 and Ne@C60 by pressurizing C60 to ca. 3 bar in a noble-gas atmosphere. Under these conditions about one out of every 650,000 C60 cages was doped with a helium atom. The formation of endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon as well as numerous adducts of the He@C60 compound was also demonstrated with pressures of 3 kbars and incorporation of up to 0.1% of the noble gases. While noble gases are chemically very inert and commonly exist as individual atoms, this is not the case for nitrogen and phosphorus and so the formation of the endohedral complexes N@C60, N@C70 and P@C60 is more surprising. The nitrogen atom is in its electronic initial state (4S3/2) and is therefore to be highly reactive. Nevertheless, N@C60 is sufficiently stable that exohedral derivatization from the mono- to the hexa adduct of the malonic acid ethyl ester is possible. In these compounds no charge transfer of the nitrogen atom in the center to the carbon atoms of the cage takes place. Therefore, 13C-couplings, which are observed very easily with the endohedral metallofullerenes, could only be observed in the case of the N@C60 in a high resolution spectrum as shoulders of the central line. The central atom in these endohedral complexes is located in the center of the cage. While other atomic traps require complex equipment, e.g. laser cooling or magnetic traps, endohedral fullerenes represent an atomic trap that is stable at room temperature and for an arbitrarily long time. Atomic or ion traps are of great interest since particles are present free from (significant) interaction with their environment, allowing unique quantum mechanical phenomena to be explored. For example, the compression of the atomic wave function as a consequence of the packing in the cage could be observed with ENDOR spectroscopy. The nitrogen atom can be used as a probe, in order to detect the smallest changes of the electronic structure of its environment. Contrary to the metallo endohedral compounds, these complexes cannot be produced in an arc. Atoms are implanted in the fullerene starting material using gas discharge (nitrogen and phosphorus complexes) or by direct ion implantation. Alternatively, endohedral hydrogen fullerenes can be produced by opening and closing a fullerene by organic chemistry methods. A recent example of endohedral fullerenes includes single molecules of water encapsulated in C60. According to state-of-the-art DFT calculations, noble gas endofullerenes should demonstrate unusual polarizability. Thus, calculated values of mean polarizability of Ng@C60 do not equal to the sum of polarizabilities of a fullerene cage and the trapped atom, i.e. exaltation of polarizability occurs.,. The sign of the ŒîŒ± polarizability exaltation depends on the number of atoms in a fullerene molecule: for small fullerenes (n<30), it is positive; for the larger ones (n>30), it is negative (depression of polarizability). The following formula, describing the dependence of ŒîŒ± on n, has been proposed: ŒîŒ± = Œ±Ng(2e‚àí0.06(n ‚Äì 20)‚àí1). It describes the DFT- calculated mean polarizabilities of Ng@C60 endofullerenes with sufficient accuracy. The calculated data allows using C60 fullerene as a Faraday cage, which isolates the encapsulated atom from the external electric field. The mentioned relations should be typical for the more complicated endohedral structures (e.g., C60@C240 and giant fullerene-containing \\"onions\\" ). Molecular endofullerenes Closed fullerenes encapsulating small molecules have been synthesized by long sequences of organic reactions. Notable achievements are the synthesis of the dihydrogen endofullerene H2@C60, the water endofullerene H2O@C60, the hydrogen fluoride endofullerene HF@C60, and the methane endofullerene CH4@C60 by the groups of Komatsu, Murata and Whitby The encapsulated molecules display unusual physical properties which have been studied by a variety of physical methods. As shown theoretically, compression of molecular endofullerenes (e.g., H2@C60) may lead to dissociation of the encapsulated molecules and reaction of their fragments with interiors of the fullerene cage. Such reactions should result in endohedral fullerene adducts, which are currently unknown.

Gr√∂nloh was a businessman by profession, but as Nescio he is mainly remembered for the three novellas De uitvreter (The Freeloader), Titaantjes (Little Titans) and Dichtertje (Little Poet). His reputation as an important Dutch writer was only established after his death. Biography Nescio was born in the Reguliersbreestraat 49 in Amsterdam, the eldest son of Jan Hendrik Frederik Gr√∂nloh, blacksmith and shopowner, with whom he shared his full name, and Martha Maria van der Reijden. Nescio grew up as Frits Gr√∂nloh, to distinguish him from his father. He was educated at a secular primary school, after which he went to the three-year HBS high school. From 1897 to 1899 he went to the Openbare Handelsschool (a college level business school). After this he started work as an office clerk in Hengelo, but quickly returned to Amsterdam, where he held a succession of similar jobs. In 1905 Nescio married Aagje Tiket, with whom he would raise four daughters. Until his death in a Hilversum sanatorium in 1961, Nescio would remain in Amsterdam. Frits Gr√∂nloh started writing as Nescio, as he wanted to keep his professional career and his writing career separate. All his stories bear witness to the conflict between his career and his ideals, as formed by the turn of the century utopian socialism. In 1900 he had started a commune inspired by Frederik van Eeden's Walden commune; the commune was wound up in 1903. He still kept his ideals but was no longer personally involved. Instead he turned to writing, as well as long solitary walks in the countryside around Amsterdam. Not very prolific, much of his writing remained unpublished until after his death, and the stories he did publish went out of print quickly. His decision to use a pseudonym does not help with this: it was only in 1932 that Nescio revealed his true name. This led to a reprint of De uitvreter/Titaantjes/Dichtertje in 1933, as well as some critical attention. It was only after World War II that he became reasonably well known, though his oeuvre is still small, roughly 160 pages. However growing critical appreciation led to him receiving the in 1954, as well as the publication of a new collection of stories just before his death in 1961. His name lives on in the form of the Nesciobrug which enables cyclists and pedestrians to go from Diemen to IJburg over the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal. Works by Nescio Nescio was not a prolific writer, and it did not help that none of his stories had any success at publication. His reputation as an important Dutch writer therefore rests solely on three short stories, De uitvreter (1911), Titaantjes (1915) and Dichtertje (1918). =De uitvreter= De uitvreter (The freeloader) was first published in the Dutch literary magazine De Gids. The central character is Japi, who wants to be the perfect bohemian, not wanting to do anything with his life but just sit and look at the sea. He is a friend of Koekebakker, the narrator, who thinks Japi is, \\"apart from the man who thought the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam was the most beautiful place in Europe, the strangest person he had known\\". He is also friends with an unsuccessful painter, Bavink, who like Koekebakker would return in Titaantjes. Japi sponges off both Koekebakker and Bavink, as well as other friends, but they do not mind greatly, as he is such an innocent. The theme of the story is how ideals conflict with the demands of society, which Japi resolves by quietly committing suicide at the end of the book (by stepping from the Nijmegen railway bridge), when it is no longer possible for him to keep pursuing his ideal of doing absolutely nothing. Bavink as an unsuccessful painter is the best at not conforming, while the narrator is slowly seduced by material comforts. =Titaantjes= Titaantjes (little titans) was first published in Groot-Nederland. It is a semi-sequel to De uitvreter and again features Koekebakker as narrator, reminiscing about his time with Bavink, and the newly introduced characters of Hoyer, Bekker, and Kees, when he still had ideals. The opening sentence is \\"Boys we were ‚Äì but nice boys\\". The story then leaps ahead several years. Koekebakker is now a successful journalist, while each of the others have failed their ideals in one way or another. Hoyer has given up on changing the world, and works painting portraits. Kees has a blue collar job. Bekker is a mid range official in the SDAP. The most ardent adherent to their youthful ideals, Bavink, went mad after being unable to create the masterpiece he had striven after for so long. =Dichtertje= Dichtertje (little poet) was published in one volume with De uitvreter and Titaantjes in a printrun of 500 copies by the art dealer J.H. de Bois. It is the story of an idealistic poet, which unlike the other two stories, is told by Nescio himself. It is slightly daring in its frank discussion of sexual mores and adultery for the time in which it was written, as well as having the \\"God of the Netherlands\\" on stage. The theme of the story is again the conflict between idealistic youth and bourgeois adulthood, with the main character both mourning the loss of his ideals and accepting in his fate as a bourgeois family man. =Other works= *Mene tekel (1946, often published together with De uitvreter/Titaantjes/Dichtertje), the name inspired by the Biblical episode of Belshazzar's feast. *Boven het Dal en andere verhalen (Above the Valley and other stories, 1961, a selection of unpublished work, which appeared shortly before his death) * De X Geboden (The X Commandments, 1971, posthumously published) * Nescio, Brieven uit Veere, 2010 =Translations= An English translation of most of Nescio's stories was published in 2012 under the title Amsterdam Stories.

Description Eisenia bicyclis is indigenous to temperate Pacific Ocean waters centered near Japan, although it is deliberately cultured elsewhere, including South Korea. Arame , Food to Good Health, 2010 retrieved 8 February 2013 It grows and reproduces seasonally. Two flattened oval fronds rise from a stiff woody stipe which can be up to about tall. The fronds are shed and new ones formed annually. The plant appears both branched and feathered. It may be harvested by divers manually or mechanically, and the dried form is available year-round. Cuisine It is one of many species of seaweed used in Asian cuisine. Usually purchased in a dried state, it is reconstituted quickly, taking about five minutes. Arame comes in dark brown strands, has a mild, semi-sweet flavor, and a firm texture. It is added to appetizers, casseroles, muffins, pilafs, soups, toasted dishes, and many other types of food. Its mild flavor makes it adaptable to many uses.Arame Seaweed, Diet Foods & Nutrition, retrieved 8 February 2013  Chemistry  Arame is high in calcium, iodine, iron, magnesium, and vitamin A as well as being a dietary source of many other minerals. It also is harvested for alginate, fertilizer and iodide. It contains the storage polysaccharide laminarin and the tripeptide eisenin, a peptide with immunological activity. Lignan content in arame is noted by several sources. It also contains the phlorotannins phlorofucofuroeckol A, dioxinodehydroeckol, fucofuroeckol A, eckol, dieckol, triphloroethol A and 7-phloroethol.

It had around 100 sites across the globe and employed nearly 35,000 people. In October 2018 is was acquired by French aerospace and defense company Safran.  History= Aeronautic foundations (1896 - 1933)= The company was founded in 1896 as \\"Mallet, M√©landri et de Pitray\\" by Maurice Mallet and his associates. In the beginning, the company was involved in the production of hydrogen balloons for sport and tourism. In 1909, the company changed its name to become \\"Zodiac\\". It then experienced a boom in the construction of airplanes and airships, especially for the A√©rostation Maritime (Naval Balloon Command) and through its participation in the war effort. Until the 1930s, 63 airships would leave Zodiac's workshops. = Marine activities (1934 - 1972)= In 1934, the company created the first prototype inflatable boats, ancestors of the renowned \\"Zodiac\\", which would contribute to the development of the civil and military inflatable boat industry. The company then benefited from the boom in leisure activities after the Second World War, as well as the French infatuation with recreational boating in the 1960s: Zodiac, therefore, developed inflatable boats for the civil market and gradually gave up the airship market for the more promising water sports market. Zodiac would nevertheless honor a contract in 1966 with CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - National Centre for Space Studies) for the production of a meteorological balloon, in the scope of the EOLE project. At the end of the 1960s, the Group reorganized and set up its first sales operation for exporting its products overseas more easily. In 1964 it opened its first subsidiary in Spain - \\"Zodiac Espa√±ola\\" - and then \\"Zodiac North America\\" in 1970. = Group internationalization (1973 - 1989) = At the beginning of the 1970s, Zodiac experienced financial difficulties. Spurred on by its new CEO, Jean-Louis Gerondeau, and with the support of shareholders and the IDI (Institut pour le D√©veloppement Industriel - French Institute for Industrial Development), the Group recovered by 1977. In 1983, Zodiac was the first company to be listed on the 'Second Market' of the Paris Stock Exchange. The firm conducted an international development policy and increases its acquisitions, thereby enabling it to position itself in niche markets on a global scale. In 1978, it acquired A√©razur Constructions A√©ronautiques and thus re-entered the aerospace market. In 1979, it acquired EFA (Parachutes), which led to the creation of the aerospace segment, and continued its development in marine and aerospace with the acquisitions of Bombard-L'Angevini√®re (ranked second in inflatable boats), Sevylor (leading French producer of light PVC inflatable structures) in 1981 and Superflexit (flexible tanks) in 1983, as well as the takeover of Parachutes de France (sport parachutes). In 1987, Zodiac acquired Air Cruisers (leader in evacuation slides), Metzeler (inflatable boats), B. Kern, and Europool In 1988, it acquired Pioneer, at the time the second American manufacturer of deceleration and engine braking recovery systems through parachutes. = Development of aerospace businesses (1990 - 2006) = In the 1990s, the Group continued its acquisitions, strengthening its aerospace business. In 1998, Monogram Systems (onboard water and waste management) joined, as did the Intertechnique Group in 1999. The latter acquisition significantly increased the aerospace share in the Group's business and later enabled the creation of the Aircraft Systems segment, specializing in on-board systems. From 2002 to 2006, Zodiac successively acquired ESCO (emergency arresting systems), ICORE (cable protection and interconnect systems), Avox Systems (oxygen systems), C&D; Aerospace (cabin interiors), Enertec and In-Snec (telemetry and data recording). = Split and refocus on aerospace (2007 to present day) = In September 2007, the Zodiac Group sold its Marine business to a holding company, 72% owned by the American Group Carlyle with 28% being retained by Zodiac, thus creating Zodiac Marine and Pool. In November 2007, Olivier Zarrouati succeeded Jean-Louis Gerondeau as Chief Executive Officer. At the beginning of 2008, the Group was renamed Zodiac Aerospace and adopted a new logo. At the end of 2008, Zodiac Aerospace strengthened its position in the cabin interiors segment by acquiring the Dutch company Driessen (leading manufacturer of galleys for single-aisle aircraft and trolleys), Adder (cabin separators) and TIA (electrical equipment for galleys, mainly for the business aircraft market). Zodiac Aerospace continued its acquisition strategy in cabin interiors as well as in systems. In 2010, the Canadian company Cantwell Cullen & Co (cabling and interconnect systems) and the German company Sell GmbH (galleys for wide-bodied aircraft) joined the Group. The year 2010 was marked by a takeover bid for Zodiac Aerospace by the French Group Safran. At the beginning of July 2010, Zodiac Aerospace announced that it had been officially approached by Safran and that, having examined Safran's proposal, its Supervisory Board had unanimously decided not to pursue it. For several months, Zodiac and Safran squared up in the media. In November 2010, the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) summoned Safran to clarify its position: its CEO, Jean-Paul Herteman announced in November 2010 that he had given up his plan to acquire Zodiac Aerospace. Since 2011, Zodiac Aerospace has continued its acquisitions: *Heath Tecna (cabin interiors for commercial aircraft); *Contour Aerospace (first class and business class seats); *IMS (IFE - In-Flight Entertainment - systems); *NAT (engineering and certification); *TriaGnoSys (on-board connectivity systems for In-flight entertainment ); *PPP (oxygen systems); *Greenpoint Technologies (VIP/VVIP configuration layout design for wide-bodied aircraft); *Enviro Systems (environment control system). In September 2012, Zodiac Aerospace put in place an organization comprising five segments (Zodiac Aerosafety, Zodiac Aircraft Systems, Zodiac Cabin & Structures, Zodiac Galleys & Equipment and Zodiac Seats), complemented by an after-sales service business, Zodiac Aerospace Services. = Explosion = On Tuesday, July 14, 2015, an explosion occurred in a prepreg treater at Zodiac Aerospace's Engineered Materials Plant in Newport, Washington, United States. Five individuals were injured as a result of the blast, and people were asked to remain at least 600 meters from the building. = Acquisition by Safran = On 19 January 2017, Safran announced a deal to buy Zodiac at ‚Ç¨29.47 per share in cash, with a deal total of almost ‚Ç¨10 billion ($10.5 billion). In May 2017, Safran reduced the amount offered to take Zodiac by $1 billion after Zodiac posted an unfavorable earnings forecast. On 19 October 2018, Safran and Zodiac Aerospace signed an agreement for the latter to merge into Safran.  Zodiac Aerospace brand  When it was founded in 1896, the company was called \\"Mallet, M√©landri et de Pitray\\". It changed its name several times during the course of its history. In 1899, it became \\"Ateliers de constructions a√©ronautiques Maurice Mallet\\" (Maurice Mallet aerospace construction workshops), and nine years later it became \\"Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des ballons dirigeables\\" (\\"French company of balloons and dirigibles\\"). In 1909, the name Zodiac (with an English spelling) appeared in the name \\"Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de ballons dirigeables et d'aviation Zodiac\\" (\\"French company of balloons, dirigibles, and aviation, Zodiac\\"), followed in 1911 by \\"Soci√©t√© Zodiac, anciens √âtablissements a√©ronautiques Maurice Mallet\\" (\\"Zodiac Company, formerly Maurice Mallet aeronautical establishments\\"). In 1965, the company changed its name to \\"Zodiac\\". The name Zodiac is associated with the inflatable boats that were developed after the Second World War and made famous by the explorations of Jacques Cousteau and the experiences of intentional castaway Alain Bombard. For this reason, when the Zodiac Group sold its Marine business in 2007, the Zodiac brand was also sold. In accordance with the agreements signed with the acquiring company, the Group took the name of \\"Zodiac Aerospace\\", which emphasized its refocus on aerospace. This name change was accompanied by the creation of a new logo.

The White House Iraq Group (aka, White House Information Group or WHIG) was an arm of the White House whose purpose was to inform the public about the purpose of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The task force was set up in August 2002 by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and chaired by Karl Rove to coordinate all of the executive branch elements in the run-up to the war in Iraq. However, it is widely speculated that the intention of the task force was \\"escalation of rhetoric about the danger that Iraq posed to the U.S., including the introduction of the term 'mushroom cloud'\\" . \\"Up to the Invasion\\" Soon after WHIG was formed, the Bush Administration's claims about the danger Iraq posed escalated significantly: * July 23, 2002: The Downing Street Memo was written, in which British intelligence said \\"C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\\" * August, 2002: White House Iraq Group formed. * September 5, 2002: In a WHIG meeting, chief Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson proposes the use of a \\"smoking gun/mushroom cloud\\" metaphor to sell the American public on the supposed nuclear dangers posed by Saddam Hussein. According to Newsweek columnist Michael Isikoff, \\"The original plan had been to place it in an upcoming presidential speech, but WHIG members fancied it so much that when the Times reporters contacted the White House to talk about their upcoming piece [about aluminum tubes], one of them leaked Gerson's phrase -- and the administration would soon make maximum use of it.\\" (Hubris, p. 35.) * September 6, 2002: In an interview with the New York Times, Andrew Card did not mention the WHIG specifically but hinted at its mission: \\"From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August.\\" On September 17, 2002, Matt Miller stated on NPR that the above quote from Andrew Card was in response to the question: \\"... why the administration waited until after Labor Day to try to sell the American people on military action against Iraq\\" * September 7, 2002: Judith Miller of The New York Times reports Bush administration officials said \\"In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.\\" In fact, many government officials had concluded the tubes were unsuitable for uranium refinement. * September 7‚Äì8, 2002: President Bush and nearly all his top advisers blanketed the airwaves, talking about the dangers posed by Iraq. ** On NBC's \\"Meet the Press,\\" Vice President Richard Cheney cited the New York Times article, and accused Saddam of moving aggressively to develop nuclear weapons over the past fourteen months to add to his stockpile of chemical and biological arms. ** On CNN, Condi Rice acknowledged that \\"there will always be some uncertainty\\" in determining how close Iraq may be to obtaining a nuclear weapon but said, \\"We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\\" ** On CBS, President Bush said U.N. weapons inspectors, before they were denied access to Iraq in 1998, concluded that Saddam was \\"six months away from developing a weapon.\\" He also cited satellite photos released by a U.N. agency Friday that show unexplained construction at Iraq sites that weapons inspectors once visited to search for evidence Saddam was trying to develop nuclear arms. \\"I don't know what more evidence we need,\\" Bush said. * October 14, 2002: President Bush says of Saddam \\"This is a man that we know has had connections with al Qaeda. This is a man who, in my judgment, would like to use al Qaeda as a forward army.\\" * January 21, 2003: Bush says of Saddam \\"He has weapons of mass destruction -- the world's deadliest weapons -- which pose a direct threat to the United States, our citizens and our friends and allies.\\" * February 5, 2003: Colin Powell addresses the United Nations, asserting that there was \\"no doubt in my mind\\" that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons. * March 19, 2003: The U.S. invades Iraq. Members The members of the White House Iraq Group include: * Karl Rove * Karen Hughes * Mary Matalin * Andrew Card * Dan Bartlett * James R. Wilkinson * Condoleezza Rice * Stephen Hadley * I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby * Michael Gerson * Rendon Group * Ari Fleischer Response to Yellowcake Forgery Issue In response to the Yellowcake forgery issue, the White House Iraq Group devised this strategy to combat critics: \\"There is a strategy now, devised by White House communications director Dan Bartlett, Mary Matalin, a former aide to Vice President Cheney, and former Bush aide Karen Hughes. Both advise the White House as a consultants to the Republican National Committee. The plan: Release all relevant information. Try to shift attention back to Bush's leadership in the war on terrorism. Diminish the significance of that single piece of iffy intelligence by making the case that Saddam was a threat for many other reasons. Put Republican lawmakers and other Bush allies on TV to defend him. Most important: Question the motives of Democrats who supported the war but now are criticizing the president.\\" From British Report: From our examination of the intelligence and other material on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Africa, we have concluded that: a. It is accepted by all parties that Iraqi officials visited Niger in 1999. b. The British Government had intelligence from several different sources indicating that this visit was for the purpose of acquiring uranium. Since uranium constitutes almost three-quarters of Niger's exports, the intelligence was credible. c. The evidence was not conclusive that Iraq actually purchased, as opposed to having sought, uranium and the British Government did not claim this. d. The forged documents were not available to the British Government at the time its assessment was made, and so the fact of the forgery does not undermine it. CIA leak scandal Records and notes of White House Iraq Group activities were subpoenaed by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald as part of the investigation into the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity.

The memorial commemorates the Canadian First Division's participation in the Second Battle of Ypres of World War I which included fighting in the face of the first poison gas attacks along the Western Front. Frederick Chapman Clemesha's sculpture, the Brooding Soldier, was selected to serve as the central feature of the monument following a design competition organized by the Canadian Battlefield Monument Commission in 1920. Background The village of Saint Julien and a section of forested land called Saint Julien Wood was at a pronounced bend in the north east sector of the Ypres Salient prior to the Second Battle of Ypres. The area was also the junction between the British and French sectors of responsibility. The Canadian First Division was assigned the most northern section of the British line and to their left, the 45th (Algerian) Division held the southernmost end of the French line. The German Army had brought forward 168 tons of chlorine gas deployed in 5,730 cylinders buried in front of their trenches, opposite Langemark-Poelkapelle, north of Ypres. The Canadians, who had been moved into their positions only a few days earlier were manning the lines for several hundred metres along a front to the southwest of St. Julien when the German Army unleashed the first poison gas attack on the Western Front on 22 April 1915. Pushed towards the Allied lines by a wind from the north, the initial gas attack largely drifted to the north and west of the Canadian lines, into the trenches of the French colonial troops of the French 45th (Algerian) and 87th (Territorial) Divisions, of 26th Reserve Corps. The gas drifted across positions largely held French colonial troops who broke ranks and abandoned their trenches after witnessing the early casualties, creating an 8,000 yard (7 km) gap in the Allied line. The German infantry were also wary of the gas and, lacking reinforcements, failed to exploit the break before the First Canadian Division and assorted French troops reformed the line in scattered, hastily prepared positions 1,000 to 3,000 yards apart. In actions at Kitcheners Wood, Mauser Ridge, Pilkem Ridge and Gravenstafel Ridge the Canadians held the line and prevented a German breakthrough until they were relieved by reinforcements on the 24 April. In the 48 crucial hours that they held the line, 6,035 Canadians - or one man in every three who went into battle - became casualties; of that number, approximately 2,000 (or one man in every nine) were killed. Memorial=Site and design selection= Clemesha's design proposal At the end of the war, The Imperial War Graves Commission granted Canada eight sites - five in France and three in Belgium - on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement in the war and for this reason it was originally decided that each battlefield would be treated equally and graced with identical monuments. 205 The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission was formed in November 1920 and decided a competition would be held to select the design of the memorial that would be used at the eight European sites. In October 1922, the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward was selected as the winner of the competition, and the submission of Frederick Chapman Clemesha placed second. The commission decided Allward's monumental design would be used at Vimy Ridge in France as it was the most dramatic location. 66‚Äì69 Originally, Clemesha's 'Brooding Soldier' design was selected for the remaining sites but was later, for a number of reasons, erected only at Saint Julien in Belgium. The remaining six sites at Passchendaele, and Hill 62 in Belgium and Le Quesnel, Dury, Courcelette and Bourlon Wood in France each received an essentially identical Canadian granite block memorial marker, differentiated only with brief inscriptions that describe the battle they commemorate in English and French on their sides. The blocks are situated in small parks that vary in shape and design and are typically situated on key points of the battlefield they memorialize. The top of the memorial.The memorial at Saint Julien was unveiled on 8 July 1923 by Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught and the tribute was made by French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, former Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers on the Western Front. In his address, Foch stated; After their completion in the mid-1920s, the sites became links in a chain of memorials that included 900+ Commonwealth cemeteries, making a road of remembrance or via dolorosa. =Design and location= Plaque on the side of the Brooding Soldier statue. The memorial is found on the northern fringe of the village of Saint Julien at the intersection of the N313 road and Zonnebekestraat. During the war, the location where the memorial is located was known as Vancouver Corner. Visible for miles around, the memorial stands 11 metres tall. The 'Brooding Soldier' column rises from a low circular flagstone terrace and is sculpted at its top to form the bowed head and shoulders of a Canadian soldier. The soldier's hands resting are on the butt of his down-turned rifle in the 'arms reversed' position, a pose used as gesture of mourning and respect for the fallen performed at funerals and services of remembrance. Surrounding the column and central terrace are gardens of tall cedars trimmed into the shape of artillery shells and low cut cedars trimmed to look like shell explosions. Some of the soil that nourishes the gardens of the memorial was brought from various locations from across Canada to represent the broad spectrum of Canadian men who fought shoulder to shoulder on the battlefields of 1915. A replica of Clemesha's St-Julien monument was incorporated into the cenotaph designed by R. W. G. Heughan which was erected in Victoria Park, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1926.

Founded in 1899, it is the first children's museum in the United States ‚Äì and according to some, the first one worldwide. It is unusual in its location in what is predominantly a residential area. Housed in a multi-level underground gallery, the museum underwent an expansion and renovation to double its space, reopened on September 20, 2008, and became the first green museum in New York City. Exhibits The museum's collection and exhibitions reflect its long history as well as the changes in children's educational needs over time and the changing environment. Its original focus was the presentation of natural science to children raised in an urban environment, but following World War II, technology and cultural awareness became more important. The underground gallery in which the museum was located following a 1975 move provided the ideal location for arranging evolving exhibits. The museum was not intended to solely attract the interest of a young audience, but rather to engage their minds from a young age. Children contribute extensively in the planning of museum exhibits, and have done so for a significant part of its history. History The Museum was founded following a proposal from the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (now the Brooklyn Museum) on December 16, 1899 in the Adams House. The museum operated under the direction of the Brooklyn Institute and received approximately $70,000 in funds from New York City each year to supplement the donations it received. Attendance grew quickly, with monthly visitation exceeding 13,000 by October, 1905. In 1929, the museum opened the Smith House annex. Eleanor Roosevelt attended the ceremony. In 1930, the Works Progress Administration supplied hundreds of workers to the museum, which thrived in the Great Depression. Among these workers was Ellis Credle, who painted murals before her career as an author began. By October 1930, monthly visitation had reached 60,000 and by 1939, the museum had received move than 9 million visitors since it opened 40 years prior. In 1968 The Brooklyn Children's Museum opened MUSE, the Bedford LIncoln Neighborhood Museum. https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/muse-photographs-8039 https://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/28/archives/museum-beckons-please-do-touch- bedfordstuyvesant-youth-get-new.html In 1975, the museum moved to an award- winning new space, housed underneath Brower Park at St Mark's and Brooklyn Avenues, following the demolition of the Victorian houses that served as its prior home. In 1996, the museum was once again renovated at a cost of $7 million to include miniature amphitheaters and a number of new galleries. Two years later, it became a part of Heart of Brooklyn, a cultural partnership established to promote tourism to Brooklyn. In 2005, it was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In the same year, work began on the $43 million expansion that was to nearly double the size of the museum, and handle more than 400,000 visitors each year. As part of its commitment to environmental integrity and energy efficiency, the institution has taken credit for being the first New York City museum to use geothermal wells for heating and cooling purposes.

Ryle's Concept of Mind (1949) critiques the notion that the mind is distinct from the body, and refers to the idea as \\"the ghost in the machine.\\" According to Ryle, the classical theory of mind, or \\"Cartesian rationalism,\\" makes a basic category mistake, as it attempts to analyze the relation between \\"mind\\" and \\"body\\" as if they were terms of the same logical category. This confusion of logical categories may be seen in other theories of the relation between mind and matter. For example, the idealist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce physical reality to the same status as mental reality, while the materialist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce mental reality to the same status as physical reality.de Morais Ribeiro, Henrique. 10‚Äì15 August 1998. \\"On the Philosophy of Cognitive Science.\\" Proceedings of the 20th World Congress of Philosophy, Boston, MA: World Congress of Philosophy.

[1949] 2002. The Concept of Mind. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 11. > There is a doctrine about the nature and place of the mind which is > prevalent among theorists, to which most philosophers, psychologists and > religious teachers subscribe with minor reservations.

The body and the mind are ordinarily harnessed together, > but after the death of the body the mind may continue to exist and function. The central principles of the doctrine, according to Ryle, are unsound and conflict with the entire body of what we know about the mind. Of the doctrine, he says \\"According to the official doctrine each person has direct and unchangeable cognisance. In consciousness, self-consciousness and introspection, he is directly and authentically apprised of the present states of operation of the mind.\\"Cottingham, John G. 1996. Western Philosophy: An Anthology, Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies 10. Wiley. . p. 189. = \\"Descartes' Myth\\" = In his essay \\"Descartes' Myth\\", Ryle's philosophical arguments lay out his notion of the mistaken foundations of mind-body dualism. He suggests that, to speak of mind and body as substances, as a dualist does, is to commit a category mistake: > Such in outline is the official theory. I shall often speak of it, with > deliberate abusiveness, as \\"the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine.\\" I hope > to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in > principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one > big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category > mistake. Ryle then attempts to show that the \\"official doctrine\\" of mind/body dualism is false by asserting that it confuses two logical-types, or categories, as being compatible: \\"it represents the facts of mental life as if they belonged to one logical type/category, when they actually belong to another. The dogma is therefore a philosopher's myth.\\"  Arthur Koestler  Arthur Koestler brought Ryle's concept to wider attention in his 1967 book The Ghost in the Machine.Koestler, Arthur. 1967. The Ghost in the Machine. The book's main focus is the movement of mankind towards self-destruction, particularly in the nuclear arms arena. It is particularly critical of the behaviourist theory of B. F. Skinner. One of the book's central concepts is that, as the human brain has grown, it has built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures, and that this is the eponymous \\"ghost in the machine.\\" Koestler's theory is that at times these structures can overpower higher logical functions, and are responsible for hate, anger and other such destructive impulses.  In popular culture  * In The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands (1991), author Stephen King uses the concept of the ghost in the machine to refer to his character Blaine the Mono, the train with a split mind that runs the town of Lud. *2010: Odyssey Two (1982), by Arthur C. Clarke, contains a chapter called \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", referring to the virtual consciousness inside a computer. *Ghost in the Shell, a Japanese manga and anime created by Masamune Shirow, takes place in a future wherein computer technology has evolved to be able to interface with the human brain, making artificial intelligence and cyber- brains indistinguishable from organic brains. The protagonist, Major Motoko Kusanagi, has a body that is completely cybernetic, with her brain being the only part of her that is still human. Shirow adapted the title from Arthur Koestler's 1967 book The Ghost in the Machine. * In season 3 of The Transformers (1986), an episode titled \\"Ghost In The Machine\\" focuses on the ghost of Starscream, who possesses Scourge, Astrotrain, and Trypticon in a scheme to get Unicron to recreate his body. In this case it is a literal ghost inside literal machines (robots). * In I, Robot, Dr. Alfred Lanning, who is a central character, uses the phrase \\"ghosts in the machine\\" to refer to the process of artificial intelligence unexpectedly evolving past its original intended purpose.

It is an industrial area with textile, metallurgical, and glass industries. The houses of Manresa are arranged around the basilica of Santa Maria de la Seu. Saint Ignatius of Loyola stopped to pray in the town on his way back from Montserrat in 1522. He also read in solitude in a cave near the town for a year, which contributed to the formulation of his Spiritual Exercises. As such, the town is a place of pilgrimage for Catholics. It is believed the comarcal name \\"Bages\\" comes from a corruption of the Latin \\"Bacchus\\" due to the extensive production of wine in the area. The wine was grown mainly in terraced vineyards, and many of these old terraces can be seen today. Wine ceased to be the main product of the area as a consequence of phylloxera, but is still a very important part of the Manresa/Bages economy. During the Napoleonic invasion, the volunteer troops of Manresa (sometent in Catalan language) defeated the French troops in the Bruch Pass (June 1808), but the retreating French burned and demolished much of the town. After the expulsion of Napoleon's troops, Manresans rebuilt the town using the rubble. History=Influential documents= * In 1892 the Uni√≥ Catalanista, a confederation of Catalan centres approved the Bases de Manresa (Manresa Bases) the first draft statute of self-government for Catalonia and laid the essential conditions for a Catalan Regional Constitution. * Bases propositions included: ** Catalan should be the sole official language in Catalonia ** Public order be under the jurisdiction of the Catalan government exclusively, which should also control finance and taxation ** Catalans only should be eligible for public office in Catalonia ** Military service (from which the upper class could buy exemption) was to be replaced by a volunteer corps ** As prior to 1714, there should be no appeal from decisions of the Catalan high court. * The Bases also called for the composition of a Catalan Parliament, which was to be elected by ‚Äòall heads of family, grouped together in classes based on manual work, technical skill or professional careers and on property, industry and commerce, as far as possible through the corresponding guild organizations‚Äô * The 1408 Liber Manifesti of Manresa is an influential historical document that lets us peer into Renaissance practice of slavery. * The Liber Manifesti consistently designates slaves as distinct from other servants and provides us with basic but prior elusive figures like the total number of slaves in the town, the proportion of slaves to free people, the percentage of households who owned slaves, the proportion of women and children amongst slaves, and the market value of female, male, and child slaves. =Jewish history= Santa Cova, where St Ignatius stayed during his time in Manresa In the 12th century Manresa was said to have contained 500 Jewish families, most of whom lived in a narrow lane called \\"Grau dels Jueus,\\" near the town hall; their cemetery, still called \\"Fossana dels Jueus,\\" was outside the city. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Jews there were engaged in manufacturing, trading, money-lending, and in the cultivation of their vineyards and estates. The hostility of the Christians towards the Jews, which prevailed throughout Catalonia, was also manifested in Manresa. In 1325 the Christian inhabitants of the town tried to prevent the Jews from baking their Passover bread, so that the latter were obliged to appeal to the King for protection. The Jews in Manresa did not escape the general persecution of 1391, and many of them professed to accept Christianity. After 1414 comparatively few Jews remained in the town, and in 1492 they sold their property for whatever they could get, and left the country. At the beginning of the 15th century Manresa had 30,000 inhabitants; three centuries later it contained barely one-fifth of that number. Several members of the Zabarra (Sabara) family lived in Manresa. The town is not mentioned in the \\"Shebe·π≠ Yehudah.\\"  Climate  Manresa has a humid subtropical (K√∂ppen Cfa), with cold winters and hot, moderately dry summers, while the rainiest seasons are spring and autumn.  Main sights  La Seu from the Tower of Santa Caterina Three bridges cross the Cardener River. The 14th-century basilica of Santa Maria de la Seu stands on a rock above the oldest bridge. La Seu is the principal monument of Manresa. The church we can see today was designed by Berenguer de Montagut who also designed Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona .The architectural style is characteristic of Catalan Gothic. The work began in 1325, but the church was not finished until the end of the 15th century. The municipal museum is housed in the cloisters of the 17th-century church of Sant Ignasi. This church is part of the Sanctuary Cave of Saint Ignatius (in Catalan Cova de Sant Ignasi), built over a cave in which Saint Ignatius of Loyola is said to have prayed and meditated. Economy Industry in the town covers textile-making, metallurgy, and glass manufacture. Major events The Fira Mediterrania in Manresa is held the first complete weekend in November every year. It is the main meeting point and trade fair of the mediterranean world, folk and roots artists with distributors, organisers, agencies, labels, export offices, instrument makers and dealers, journalists and other professionals. Manresa Town Hall The original building dates back to the 19th century. Remodeling was agreed to be needed due to the old building's impractical use in Modern times. At the end of 2004, a competition was held to remodel the building with the aim of easing its disabled circulation. The Barcelona-based Add + Arquitectura was selected and the project was completed in 2008. Add partners Manuel Bailo and Rosa Rull were responsible for the design. Bailo and Rull's key move was to partly demolish and extend the rear south-west wall of the town hall in order to implant a new circulation core The front of the building maintained its traditional structure but at the rear of the building, the elevator and staircase are encased in a \\"cubist cacoon\\". Places borrowing the name *Because of the town's association with St. Ignatius, the novitiate house of the English province of the Jesuits is called Manresa House. Formerly in Roehampton in the London suburbs, it is now in Birmingham. *SEARSOLIN, the extension/outreach research center of Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan, is also called the Manresa complex. *Manresa School takes its name from the town of Manresa, because Saint Candida Maria de Jesus, the foundress of the congregation that runs the school, is influenced by Ignatian spirituality. *Manresa House of Retreats was founded by the Jesuit religious order on the banks of the Mississippi River, midway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, in Convent, Louisiana. The 130-acre campus hosts three- day preached retreats for men, made in silence, based on the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius Loyola. *Manresa Island Manresa Island is a 144-acre coastal property in Norwalk, Connecticut, that is the site of a decommissioned coal-fired power plant.

He was a founding member of Argent, which was led by his cousin Rod Argent, and performed with them from their formation in 1969 until they disbanded in 1976. He was the bass guitarist for the Kinks from 1978 until they disbanded in 1997. In 2004, he joined the reunited Zombies, whom he had been closely associated with since the early 1960s, and remained a member until his death in 2018. He was also a member of the Swinging Blue Jeans and the Kast Off Kinks. Early years Rodford was born on 7 July 1941, in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a member of the Bluetones, the biggest band in St Albans at the time. Although he did not become a band member at this stage, Rodford was instrumental in helping his younger cousin Rod Argent form the Zombies in 1964. Rodford later joined the Mike Cotton Sound as a bass guitarist. Music career Rodford performing in Mannheim, Germany in 1979 with the Kinks. Ray Davies (L) and Rodford Along with Rod Argent, Rodford was one of the founding members of Argent. When Rod Argent quit the band, the remaining three members (Rodford, Bob Henrit, and John Verity) formed the short-lived band Phoenix. Eventually, Rodford joined the Kinks as a bass guitarist in 1978 and played with them until their final disintegration in 1997. From 1999‚Äì2001 Rodford appeared in a band that ex-Animals guitarist Hilton Valentine formed, the Animals II, which also featured former Animals drummer John Steel, and keyboardist Dave Rowberry. Rodford continued with this band (which changed its working name to \\"The Animals and Friends\\" after Valentine left) until joining Argent and Colin Blunstone in the revival of the Zombies. Rodford never played with the Zombies in the 1960s, despite having been closely involved with them. However, he began to play the bass guitar with the band's reincarnation in the early years of the 21st century, with his son Steve on drums. In 2008, Rodford joined the Kast Off Kinks, on the retirement of John Dalton, whom he had followed into the Kinks after Andy Pyle. In 2009, Jim Rodford regularly played in \\"The Rodford Files\\" along with his sons Steve Rodford (Blunstone/Argent band) on drums and Russ Rodford on guitar, plus Derik Timms (mOOn Dogs) on guitar, lap steel, slide and vocals. In 2010, the original line-up of Argent reformed and resumed playing in concert. They mounted a short tour including gigs in Frome, Southampton, Wolverhampton, Leamington Spa and London. On 20 January 2018, Rodford died after he fell down stairs at his home in St Albans. Personal life Rodford met his wife, Jean, at the Pioneer Club, St Albans, in the early days of his music career. They have two sons, Steve, a drummer, Russell a guitarist and a daughter, Paula. Rodford died after a fall on 20 January 2018, at the age of 76, a few days after returning from America where he had played a few gigs with The Zombies. His son Steve is currently the drummer for the Zombies.

He served for eighteen years in the Iranian government prior to the Iranian Revolution including as Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance and Iran's Ambassador to the United States from 1967-1969. He has been chairman or director of companies both in Iran and in the United States. Political career Born in Ahvaz, in Iran's Khuzestan Province, Ansary first worked as a newspaper and magazine photographer in Ahvaz, Tehran, and England before moving to Japan in 1954. There he met Abbas Aram, Iran's ambassador to Japan, who soon brought him to the attention of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Shah asked Ansary to return to Iran and appointed him to several government positions starting in 1961, including Undersecretary of Commerce, ambassador to many African nations and to Pakistan, and Minister of Information.Milani, p. 80. In 1964, he married Maryam Panahi, a friend of ambassador Aram who had many high-ranking acquaintances in the governments of the United States and Iran. He served as Ambassador to the United States and then as Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance. His accomplishments during this time included assisting the Shah in lending millions of dollars in aid and grants to other countries and the signing of an agreement with U.S. State Secretary Henry Kissinger to build eight nuclear power plants in Iran.Milani, pp. 81‚Äì83. By the 1970s, the CIA considered Ansary to be one of the seventeen members of \\"the Shah's Inner Circle\\" and he was one of the Shah's top two choices to succeed Amir Abbas Hoveyda as Prime Minister. Ultimately, this appointment went to Jamshid Amouzegar, and Ansary became the leader of the Constructionist wing of the Rastakhiz party, which opposed Amouzegar's Progressive wing. Some of Ansary's supporters have seen Amouzegar's appointment as a poor decision in hindsight. Even his now ex-wife Maryam Panahi, to whom his marriage \\"came to a bitter end\\" according to historian Abbas Milani,Milani, p. 84. has said that \\"not appointing Hushang was one of the shah's two biggest mistakes, leading to the revolution.\\"Milani, p. 83. In November 1977, Ansary became the director of the National Iranian Oil Company, but resigned one year later and moved to the United States, citing health problems.Milani, pp. 82‚Äì84. Business and philanthropy During his time in the Iranian government, Ansary also maintained a successful career in business. He was the director of an unstable company called Fakhre Iran, which he made profitable and sold to the government.Milani, p. 81. Ansary arrived in the U.S. a very wealthy manMilani, p. 83: \\"According to William Shawcross, Ansary 'was one of the richest men' in Iran.\\"; Milani, p. 84: \\"...he had clearly come to America a very rich man‚ÄîForbes called him a 'multimillionaire refugee'‚Äî...\\". and became a U.S. citizen in 1986. After settling in the United States, Ansary started the Parman Group, a holding company for leisure industries, textiles, international trade, and real estate, which included IRI International - a company that makes oilfield equipment. IRI International was sold to National Oilwell Varco in 2005. Ansary was the chairman of Stewart & Stevenson LLC until the company was purchased by Kirby Corp in September 2018.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kirby-corporation-completes-the- purchase-of-stewart--stevenson-llc-and-reports-on-the-impact-of-hurricanes- harvey-and-irma-300519244.html In recent years Ansari and Parman have come under scrutiny of the Central Bank of Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten (CBCS) with regard to financial misappropriations regarding an insurance company operating in the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten. The CBCS has stated that under shareholder Parman International B.V., in which Ansary is a majority shareholder, ENNIA Caribe Holding and ENNIA Caribe Investments had appropriated 1,5 billion Antillean guilders (approximately $838 million) from ENNIA insurance companies.https://www.centralbank.cw/uploads/files/Persberichten%202019-005%20Reactie%20op%20mediaberichten%20NED.pdfhttps://stmaartennews.com/banking/ansary- frustrates-restructuring-insurance-company-ennia/ These insurance companies operate on the islands of Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten and therefore fall under the supervision of the CBCS. According to the CBCS, the appropriation took place by having the insurance companies invest in shares in another Parman subsidiary, Stewart & Stevenson Inc. When these shares were sold in 2017, although the insurance companies had held 74% of the shares and should have received $558.7 million, they only received $282.2 million and thus lost approximately $273 million. In another transaction, land at Mullet Bay (sint Maarten) was put in the books of the insurance company for 771 million guilders (just under $431 million) although according to Cushman & Wakefield, one of the largest appraisers in the world, the value is only 89 million guilders ($49 million). In August 2018, after negotiations between CBCS and ENNIA and major shareholder Husang Ansary collapsed, Ansary gave instructions to withdraw $100 million in policyholders money from ENNIA. After CBCS placed ENNIA under an emergency measure, the $100 million was returned to ENNIA. The CBCS notes, however, that $50 million came from a private account of Ansary.https://www.centralbank.cw/uploads/files/Persberichten%202019-005%20Reactie%20op%20mediaberichten%20NED.pdf page 4 On January 29, 2019, a United States Bankruptcy Court declared CBCS is entitled to the accountshttp://www.nysb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/286744_94_opinion.pdf since based on the emergency measure, CBCS, and not Parman, is effectively managing ENNIA. The accounts had been frozen because Parman and its major shareholder Ansary did not want to confirm that the CBCS is entitled to the accounts.https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/perspectives-search/insurance- rehabilitation-proceeding-in-curaao-recognized-by-new-york-bankruptcy- court.html According to the CBCS, the procedures of Parman and Ansary delay the restructuring process of ENNIA, which increases the risk of its policy holders.https://www.centralbank.cw/uploads/files/Persbericht%202019-008%20Uitspraak%20KG%20-ENG.pdf Ansary is a devoted Republican,Milani, pp. 79, 84. a former friend and business partner of Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, and James Baker, served on the National Finance Committee of the Bush-Cheney 2004 Presidential Campaign and is a trustee of the George W.

He was involved in the creation of several medical and educational institutions, such as the University of St. Martin and the James Baker Institute.

He entered the U.S. Department of State in 1942 and quickly rose through the ranks to become an influential establishment figure. He worked to influence the internal affairs of numerous Latin American nations, typically focusing on economic and political influence rather than direct military intervention. After Lyndon B. Johnson became President in 1963, Mann received a double appointment and was recognized as the U.S. authority on Latin America. In March 1964, Mann outlined a policy of supporting regime change and promoting the economic interests of U.S. businesses. This policy, which moved away from the political centrism of Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, has been called the Mann Doctrine. Mann left the State Department in 1966 and became a spokesperson for the Automobile Manufacturer's Association.  Early life  Born in Laredo, an American city on the border with Mexico, Mann grew up speaking English and Spanish. His father was a lawyer and a Southern Baptist.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 167. He attended Baylor University and Baylor Law School, both in Waco, Texas, where he met his wife, the former Nancy Aynesworth. He graduated from law school in 1934 and took a job at his father's law firm.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 168. He held various posts, as a lawyer in Laredo, in 1934 to 1942. Early career Mann was rejected from the Navy due to poor vision. He joined the Diplomatic Service, United States Department Of State in 1942, and was deployed to Montevideo in Uruguay to investigate Nazi shipping. In 1943, he was promoted to do this job across Latin America. He was involved in creating the 1945 Act of Chapultepec treaty for mutual defense of trans- American nations.  Truman administration  After unsuccessfully coordinating US opposition to Juan Per√≥n in the 1946 Argentine election, he directed US diplomats in Latin America to avoid supporting particular candidates in elections‚Äîlest they suffer due to the perceived association. He commented during the 1950 Guatemalan election: > At election time it is just political suicide to try to defend the United > States... I think on the whole people in the other American Republics > understand and support us, but it isn't good politics to say so at election > time. We are a sort of punching bag during elections. Everybody likes to > take a swing at us, and makes sure he does every time you say something. Mann sought military assistance from Latin American countries during the Korean War, commenting \\"that if the Bolivians were complaining about spilling their blood for Yankees, a lot of Yankees were also complaining about American blood already being spilled in Korea for Bolivia and other countries of the hemisphere\\".LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 169. Mann believed that nationalism and Communism were related problems, and sought to prevent both as part of efforts to prevent Latin nationalization of resources.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 170. In a surprise to many observers, he agreed to secure US aid for Bolivia following the 1952 Bolivian revolution, partly as a reward for the new government's agreement to compensate US tin companies for nationalized assets.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 172. \\"After six months of careful watching, the United States recognized the new government, then stunned observers by actually giving economic aid, especially through tin purchases. Mann privately explained why aid could be sent to supposed revolutionaries: Bolivia had agreed to compensate former tin owners, especially the relatively few American owners, through arbitration; such arbitration could be an important precedent elsewhere in case of other nationalization; if Washington did not help, it would be charged with 'trying to bring chaos and starvation to Bolivia'; and U.S. bargaining leverage over Bolivia was great because of its purchasing power in the tin markets.\\"  Eisenhower administration = Policy shift = In 1952, Mann welcomed the incoming Eisenhower administration with a 42-page memo on US relations with Latin America. The memo argued that the main issue for the US in this region was not a Communist invasion, but the problem of US control over \\"readily accessible essential strategic materials\\". These included vanadium as well as crude petroleum, resources which the US imported mostly from Latin America. Mann advocated swift US intervention to retaliate against nationalizations, as a show of force to deter similar actions by other countries. This memo was a source for NSC 144/1, representing the incoming Eisenhower administration's new policy on Latin America.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), pp. 172‚Äì174. = Guatemala = In Guatemala, Mann attended the inauguration of President Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n and pronounced him a communist. Although he resisted early overtures by United Fruit representatives to intervene, he opposed √Årbenz's land reform law, fearing that Guatemala would provide a test case for other nations. After the CIA- backed military coup in 1954, Mann was recalled from Greece to Guatemala. He established Norman Armour as the US ambassador and sought to bolster the new military government of Castillo Armas. Mann reportedly gained de facto veto power over Guatemalan policy; after Mann had rejected a new oil law, Armas said he would come to \\"no final decision without consulting with Mr. Mann.\\"LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), pp. 176‚Äì177. The final quotation comes from Memorandum of a Conversation Between the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (Holland) and President Castillo Armas, Guatemala City, February 14, 1955. Mann later reflected that US operatives in Guatemala had an \\"illusion of omnipotence\\", saying in 1975:Brockett, \\"An Illusion of Omnipotence\\" (2002), pp. 91, 117. > We were on the crest of a wave and nobody, literally nobody on the Hill or > anywhere else ever questioned our ability to do anything if we wanted to do > it [and] if we were willing to spend the money and the effort to do it. = Economic aid = In late September 1957 Mann moved to Washington, D.C., to become Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Trans-American economic problems had created dissatisfaction and threatened to push Latin American countries away from the US. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles blamed an \\"economic war\\" waged by Moscow. Vice President Richard Nixon was mobbed by angry protestors in Venezuela and elsewhere.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 178. Mann advocated policies of robust economic assistance, establishing the Inter-American Development Bank and promoting low-interest loans financed by the US government. Mann pushed for \\"a Marshall Plan for Latin America\\" which would also include private finance. Eisenhower concurred, and appointed Mann as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs in August 1960.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 179‚Äì180.  Kennedy administration  President John F. Kennedy promoted the Alliance for Progress, a centrist initiative to support Latin American economies and stave off communism through moderate reform. Mann did not support the Bay of Pigs invasion, which had been planned by the CIA before Kennedy took office. He doubted the possibility of a popular uprising and, with Kennedy, opposed involvement by the US Air Force. He resigned his position at the State Department just weeks before the invasion took place in April 1961.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 184.Irving Molotsky, \\"T. C. Mann, 87, a Maker of U.S. Latin Policy\\", New York Times, January 30, 1999. In general, Mann felt that military action against Cuba would be too damaging for the US image.P√©rez, \\"Fear and Loathing of Fidel Castro\\" (2002), pp. 236. \\"Considerable attention was given to the repercussions of unilateral action against Cuba in Latin America. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Mann was not alone in his early opposition to unilateral US efforts to remove Fidel Castro. '[I]f we were to go all out to get Castro,' Mann cautioned, 'it would obviously be what we would do. What would the effect be in the other Latin American countries? [W]e have to maintain a steady pressure and keep our motives well disguised in this business.' \\" Instead, he supported economic sanctions to create suffering and dissatisfaction among the Cuban poor.P√©rez, \\"Fear and Loathing of Fidel Castro\\" (2002), p. 241. \\"Thomas Mann agreed, predicting that sanctions would 'exert a serious pressure on the Cuban economy and contribute to the growing dissatisfaction and unrest in the country'.\\" Kennedy appointed Mann United States Ambassador to Mexico where he successfully negotiated a settlement of the Chamizal border between the US and Mexican governments, caused by a shift in the Rio Grande.  Johnson administration  On December 14, 1963, new President Lyndon B. Johnson re-appointed Mann Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. On December 21, Johnson also made Mann the head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization created by President Kennedy two years earlier. The double-appointment was opposed by the Kennedys and their liberal supporters, including Senator Hubert Humphrey and advisor Arthur Schlesinger Jr.. Schlesinger wrote that Johnson's appointment of Mann constituted \\"a declaration of independence, even perhaps a declaration of aggression against the Kennedys.\\"Stephen G. Rabe, The Most Dangerous Area in the World: John F. Kennedy Confronts Communist Revolution in Latin America; University of North Carolina Press, 1999; p. 173. Members of the United States corporate establishment, generally felt they had a good relationship with Mann and supported the appointment.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 186. \\"The Kennedys and their supporters were stunned and bitter. Key liberals such as Senator Hubert Humphrey (D.-Minn.) tried to prevent the appointments. LBJ paid no attention. U.S. corporations operating in Latin America were delighted. 'The news of Tom Mann's appointment created more favorable reaction in Latin America than the launching of President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy,' cabled the vice president for Brown and Root Overseas, Inc., a powerful Texas firm with close ties to Johnson. 'I know him well and consider him the greatest.' Some liberals, including Senator Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska) applauded the appointments in the hope that Mann could finally make Latin American policy work.\\"Walker, \\"Mixing the Sweet with the Sour\\" (1994), p. 60. = Mann Doctrine = In March 1964, the new Johnson administration held a three-day policy conference for all U.S. diplomats in Latin America. On March 18, Mann gave a secret speech to U.S. officials which laid out the administration's policy for the region. Mann did not discuss the Alliance for Progress. His policy called for non-intervention against dictators if they were friendly to US business interests, but intervention against Communists regardless of their policies. The content of Mann's speech was leaked to the New York Times. His comments were interpreted as prioritizing US economic interests over political reform, and the thrust of this policy became known as the \\"Mann Doctrine\\".LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), pp. 187‚Äì188.Muller, \\"Dependent Economic Development\\" (1985), pp. 448‚Äì449. = Brazil = Later that month, Mann supported the military overthrow of the democratically elected government in Brazil, claiming a victory against Communism. Mann assisted this takeover directly by diverting US aid to Brazil away from the Goulart's central government.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), pp. 190‚Äì191.Walker, \\"Mixing the Sweet with the Sour\\" (1994), p. 62. \\"While plans were underway to condemn Cuba for subversive activities, Secretary Mann announced the doctrine that bears his name. The United States would not inquire into the nature of regimes that were to receive military and economic assistance, an evaluation that several officials in the Kennedy administration had advocated. Support for social reforms had ceased to be a sine qua non for gaining Washington's favor.\\" US operatives interpreted the March 18 Mann Doctrine as a \\"green light\\" for the coup to go forward.Muller, \\"Dependent Economic Development\\" (1985), p. 449. \\"A minority faction within the Army (estimated by one anti-Goulart general to have consisted in early March of about 10 percent of the higher officer corps-see Stepan, 1978: 122), which had favored a coup against Goulart since the beginning of his administration because of his alleged Communist tendencies, now decided to take the offensive. They were encouraged by American policymakers at the highest level in Washington, who gave an obvious and unequivocal 'green light' signal in announcing (but not for public consumption) the 'Mann Doctrine' on March 18,' and by the American Embassy in Brazil, which offered war material in case the coup should lead to civil war.\\" After the coup, Mann stated that \\"the frustration of Communistic objectives in Brazil was the single most important victory for freedom in the hemisphere in recent years\\". = Chile = In Chile, Mann ordered an intensive and coordinated campaign in favor of Eduardo Frei against Salvador Allende in the 1964 elections. In a May 1 memo to Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Mann wrote:253\\\\. Memorandum From the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (Mann) to Secretary of State Rusk, Foreign Relations of the United States 1964‚Äì1968, Volume XXXI: \\"South and Central America; Mexico\\", Document 253.

Mann described a ten-point plan, which included:Power, \\"Engendering of Anticommunism and Fear\\" (2008), pp. 934‚Äì935. * threats of economic retaliation against Chile if Allende won; * CIA and USIA production and dissemination of unattributed propaganda against Allende; * $70 million in emergency loans to prop up the economy and reduce unemployment before the election; and * secret contacts of US government and businesses with Chilean business, military, police, clergy, trade unions, and Masons, for the purpose of opposing Allende. These efforts were successful in 1964 but reversed in 1970.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 190. \\"During the 1964 Chilean elections, Mann paid little attention either to that principle or to his lesson, learned during the Argentine election of 1946, that U.S. interference in foreign political campaigns usually backfired. Eduardo Frei, a moderate reformer, ran against Salvador Allende, suspected of Marxist leanings and, as Mann phrased it, 'extremist supporters'. The U.S. economic stake was huge, especially in industry and in copper mines that Washington feared Allende might nationalize if he won. Mann ordered complete support of Frei, threatened economic retaliation of Allende triumphed, and wanted 'no doubt in Chile as to where the United States stands.' Frei won, but the Allende problem was only delayed for six years.\\" = Bolivia = In Bolivia, when General Ren√© Barrientos Ortu√±o led a takeover of the popular Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) government, which had been in power for twelve years, Mann secured aid for the new military government.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 191. \\"The generals' success and the Mann doctrine were also played out in Bolivia and Argentina. In Bolivia, Mann (and key U.S. congressional leaders) became critical of, and began distancing the United States from, Paz Estensaro's formerly revolutionary MNR party. When the military seized power in 1964, opened the door to foreign investment, promised agrarian reforms, and smashed urban labor demands, Mann responded with aid.\\" = Panama = Mann later served in Panama during a period of intense agitation waged by Panamanians against the Panama Canal Zone. Mann began some successful negotiations with Panama, but was undercut by Johnson, who did not want to capitulate for political reasons.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), p. 192. = Dominican Republic = In the Dominican Republic, Mann labeled democratically elected President Juan Bosch a communist and supported the US invasion in 1965. In April 1965, Mann personally insisted on the production of a cable which would describe danger to American citizens in the Dominican Republic. At the same time, Mann pressured the military government to crack down on insurgents in Santo Domingo. Mann described the popular rebellion as Communist infiltration enabled by Castro and supported the U.S. invasion as a necessary response.LaFeber, \\"From the Good Neighbor to Military Intervention\\" (1993), pp. 193‚Äì194. = Promotion and resignation = Mann became the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1965. He resigned from the State Department in 1966 and served as President of the Automobile Manufacturer's Association from 1967 through 1971.John Henrichs, \\"Ex-U.S. Ambassador Thomas C.

Their language is also known as Karamojong or Karimojong and is part of the Nilotic language family. History The Karamojong live in the southern part of the region in the north-east of Uganda, occupying an area equivalent to one tenth of the country. According to anthropologists, the Karamojong are part of a group that migrated from present-day Ethiopia around 1600 A.D. and split into two branches, with one branch moving to present day Kenya to form the Kalenjin group and Maasai cluster. The other branch, called Ateker, migrated westwards. Ateker further split into several groups, including Turkana in present-day Kenya, Iteso, Dodoth, Jie, Karamojong, and Kumam in present-day Uganda, also Jiye and Toposa in southern Sudan all of them together now known as the \\"Teso Cluster\\" or \\"Karamojong Cluster\\". It is said that the Karamojong were originally known as the Jie. The name Karamojong derived from phrase \\"ekar ngimojong\\", meaning \\"the old men can walk no farther\\". According to tradition, the peoples now known as the Karamojong Cluster or Teso Cluster are said to have migrated from Abyssinia between the 1600 and 1700 AD as a single group. When they reached the area around the modern Kenyan-Ethiopian border, they are said to have fragmented into several groups including those that became Turkana, Toposa, and the Dodoth. The group that became known as the Toposa continued to present day southern Sudan; the Dodoth, settled in Apule in the northern part of present-day Karamoja. The Turkana settled in Kenya where they are now and today's Jie of Uganda are thought to have split from them, moving up the escarpment into today's Kotido District. The main body continued southwards, reportedly consisting of seven groups or clans who settled in today's southern Karamoja, eventually merging to become the three clans now existing: the Matheniko in the east around Moroto mountain, the Pian in the south and the Bokora in the west. However, a significant sized group went west and formed the Iteso, the Kumam, and the Langi. It was this group who were said to have used the phrase \\"the old men can walk no farther\\". Language Related to Turkana: in the Karamojong language, the people and the language have the convenient prefixes ≈ãi- and ≈ãa- respectively. Lack of a prefix indicates the land where they live. All the above-mentioned branches from Ateker speak languages that are mutually intelligible. (The Lango in Uganda are also ethnically and genetically close to the ≈ãiKarimojong, evidenced by similar names among other things, though they adopted a dialect of the Luo language). Culture The main livelihood activity of the Karamojong is herding livestock, which has social and cultural importance. Crop cultivation is a secondary activity, undertaken only in areas where it is practicable. Due to the arid climate of the region, the Karamojong have always practised a sort of pastoral transhumance, where for 3‚Äì4 months in a year, they move their livestock to the neighboring districts in search of water and pasture for their animals. The availability of food and water is always a concern and affects the Karamojong's interaction with other ethnic groups. Social organization The dominant feature of Karamojong society is their age system, which is strictly based on generation. As successive generations have an increasing overlap in age, this leads logically to a breakdown of the system, which appears to have occurred after rules were relaxed in the nineteenth century among their close neighbours, the Jie. However, the Karamojong system is flexible enough to contain a build-up of tension between generations over a cycle of 50 years or so. When this can no longer be resolved peacefully, the breakdown in order leads to a switch in power from the ruling generation to their successors and a new status quo. The next changeover is expected around 2013. [Dyson-Hudson, Neville (1966), Karimojong Politics, Clarendon Press, Oxford. Spencer, Paul (1998), The Pastoral Continuum: The Marginalization of Tradition in East Africa, Clarendon Press, Oxford (pp. 99‚Äì119).] As both a rite of passage into manhood, as well as a requirement for engagement, a young Karamojong man is required to wrestle the woman he desires to marry. If he is successful in winning the wrestling match against the woman, he is now considered to be a man and is permitted to marry the woman. This ensures that the man will be strong enough to care for and protect his wife. After a successful match, the dowry negotiations are allowed to commence. In an instance where the young man is unable to defeat the woman in the wrestling match, he will not be considered by his people to be a man and will often leave to marry a woman from a different people-group where a test of strength is not required. If a non-Karamojong man desires to marry a Karamojong woman, he is also required to go through this ceremony. Conflicts The Karamojong have been involved in various conflicts centered on the practice of cattle raids. The Karamojong are in constant conflict with their neighbors in Uganda, Sudan and Kenya due to frequent cattle raids. This could be partly due to a traditional belief that the Karamojong own all the cattle by a divine right, but also because cattle are also an important element in the negotiations for a bride and young men use the raids as a rite of passage and way of increasing their herds to gain status. In recent years the nature and the outcome of the raids have become increasingly violent with the acquisition of AK47s by the Karamojong. The Ugandan government have attempted to broker deals for weapons amnesties, but the number of cattle the Karamojong have wanted per gun has proved too steep for any meaningful agreement to be made.

It is the CBC Radio One affiliate in Halifax, Nova Scotia, broadcasting at 90.5 MHz. It is the flagship CBC Radio One station for the Maritime provinces. CBHA's studios are located on 7067 Chebucto Road in Halifax, while its transmitter is located on Washmill Lake Drive in Clayton Park. History The station was launched in 1944 on 1240 AM with the call sign CBH. Prior to its launch, CBC Radio programming aired on private affiliate CHNS and its shortwave relay CHNX 6.13 MHz (in the 49m band). CBH's initial power was only 100 watts and remained at that level for 18 years. In 1947 the station moved to the CBC Radio Building on 5600 Sackville Street. In 1948, the frequency was changed to 1330, and then to 1340 in 1960. In 1963, the station moved to 860 and boosted its power to 10,000 watts. However, CBH had to conform its nighttime signal to protect clear- channel sister station CJBC in Toronto, rendering it practically unlistenable at night in some parts of Halifax. To solve this problem, an FM rebroadcaster, CBHA-FM, was established on 90.5 FM in 1977.Decision CRTC 77-309 While it was only intended to be temporary, the CBC was unable to obtain the funding necessary to upgrade CBH's AM signal.Decision CRTC 86-709 On October 1, 1989, the AM station was shut down, and CBHA became the main CBC station in Halifax. Local programming The station's local programs are Information Morning and Main Street, hosted by Jeff Douglas, in the afternoon. Additionally, it produces several programs that air across the Maritimes, including the weekday noon-hour regional program Maritime Noon and the regional weekend programs Weekend Mornings, Maritime Magazine, Atlantic Airwaves and Maritime Connection. Shows are produced at studios in the CBC Radio Building at the intersection of Bell Road, Sackville Street, and South Park Street in Halifax. The station serves the Nova Scotia mainland through a network of rebroadcast transmitters, whose schedule is identical to the signal out of Halifax, with the exception of a regional program weekday afternoons from 3:00 to 4:00. The main transmitter in Halifax, as well as the rebroadcaster in Sheet Harbour, air an additional hour of \\"Main Street\\" during this time. Transmitters On December 10, 2018, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the CBC's application to operate a new FM transmitter in Digby at 107.1 MHz (channel 296A) with an effective radiated power of 420 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 256.6 metres). The new callsign for the new FM transmitter at Digby will be CBHA-FM-1 and will rebroadcast the programming of CBHA-FM.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2018-456, CBHA-FM Halifax ‚Äì New transmitter in Digby, CRTC, December 10, 2018 ReferencesExternal links *CBC Nova Scotia * * Bha Bha Category:Radio stations established in 1944 Category:1944 establishments in Nova Scotia ","title":"CBHA-FM"},{"id":"2283477","text":"The Sextans Dwarf Spheroidal is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that was discovered in 1990 by Mike Irwin as the 8th satellite of the Milky Way, located in the constellation of Sextans.

Shipley. Members are held to a high code of ethics with emphasis on consumer protection and education. The Society is based in Las Vegas, Nevada, along with the affiliated American Gem Society Laboratories (AGSL) (founded in 1996) and the American Gem Society Advanced Instruments Division (founded in 2004). The Society trains and certifies jewelers, gemologists, and jewelry appraisers. Diamond grading is the specialty of the American Gem Society Laboratories and the Society has developed its own cut, color, and clarity standards. History The AGS was created by Robert M. Shipley. During the 1920s, Shipley was operating quite successfully as a jeweler. However, despite his years in the industry, his lack of expertise regarding gems and jewelry was revealed to him by a pair of his best customers. Humbled by this revelation, Shipley realized that this was a big problem among American jewelers, one which likely accounted for much of the public's distrust for the profession at the time. Shipley lost his jewelry stores in a divorce and went to Europe, where he completed the Great Britain National Association of Goldsmiths gemological correspondence course. He brought his newfound expertise back to Los Angeles, where he founded his own preliminary course in gemology on September 16, 1930. For the next few years he worked to promote the need for gemological education and train a new breed of \\"certified\\" jewelers. These jewelers would form the foundation of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), and later the AGS. In its history, the AGS has achieved significant accomplishments within the field of gemology and jewelry. Among these are the following: *Invented the industry's first scientifically reviewed, objective, and repeatable Cut Grade method. *Created the Ideal Cut Grade for Round Brilliant shaped diamonds, often known as the AGS Ideal or the Triple Zero Cut. *Offered the industry's first diamond grading reports with a Cut Grade for Princess, Emerald, Oval, and other fancy diamond shapes. Laboratory services A big part of the AGS operation comes in the form of AGS Laboratories, which offers laboratory services to members of the jewelry industry. Primary among these are their diamond grading services. Jewelers are able to have their diamonds scientifically evaluated according to the Four Cs: Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat Weight. They are then given a diamond grading report, which can be provided to a consumer in order to verify the quality of the diamond they are purchasing. Additionally, AGS Laboratories offers laser inscription services. Through the use of a microlaser beam, the laboratory can inscribe a diamond with a serial number, a company logo, or other text on the stone. This service does not affect the quality of the diamond, and is generally performed on the girdle where it can only be viewed with a magnification device.

Early life Born in Tehran on 16 October 1928, he is the son of General Fazlollah Zahedi, who served as prime minister after participating in the CIA-led coup which led to the fall of Mohammed Mossadegh. Zahedi received a degree in agriculture from Utah State University in 1950,Utah State University USU Alumni= Great Success where he was a member of Kappa Sigma. Seven years later, he married the daughter of the Shah of Iran, Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi; the marriage ended in divorce in 1964. Political life Zahedi with President Richard Nixon in Tehran, 1969 Zahedi served as ambassador to the United States from 1960 to 1962 and to the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1966. Under Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveida, he served as minister of foreign affairs from 1966 to 1971. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Ardeshir Zahedi Zahedi again became ambassador to the United States from 1973 until the Iranian Revolution climaxed in January 1979. During his second stint in Washington, he won a reputation for extravagance. In the mid-1970s, Zahedi became known as a companion of the American actress Elizabeth Taylor. During the 1977 Hanafi Siege of a federal building in Washington, Zahedi and two other ambassadors from Muslim nations were able to talk the hostage-takers into surrendering and releasing 149 hostages. Over the course of 1978, it was reported in some circles that Zahedi urged the Shah to appease the rioters by making scapegoats of several high-ranking officials, including Amir Abbas Hoveida (then Prime Minister) and SAVAK director Nematollah Nassiri. When the Shah left Iran in 1979, Zahedi was still serving as ambassador in Washington, but resigned as soon as Khomeini came to power. He started fervent attempts at securing political asylum for the ailing Shah and the Imperial family in Panama, Mexico, Morocco and finally Egypt. He was present at the Shah's death bed and funeral in Cairo in 1980. Later years Zahedi is now retired and living in Montreux, Switzerland. He received honorary doctoral degrees of law and humanities from Utah State University, East Texas State University, Kent State University, St. Louis University, University of Texas, Montana State University, Washington College, Westminster College, Harvard University, Chung-Ang University of Seoul, and the College of Political and Social Science of Lima in Peru. In December 1976, in a ceremony held in Washington D.C., Zahedi was awarded the Kappa Sigma Fraternity ‚ÄòMan of the Year‚Äô Award. In 2002, he was inducted into the Alumni Hall of Honor of the Utah State University College of Agriculture. He received many awards and honors from nations around the globe for his humanitarian service and record in international affairs. =Views= In an interview in May 2006, Zahedi voiced his support for Iran's Nuclear Program stating it as an \\"inalienable right of Iran\\", under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). He told Voice of America that the U.S. approved the start of Iran's $50 billion nuclear program in the 1970s.

The acts assigned racial groups to different residential and business sections in urban areas in a system of urban apartheid. An effect of the law was to exclude non-whites from living in the most developed areas, which were restricted to Whites (Sea Point, Lansdowne, Cape Town, Claremont). It required many non-whites to commute large distances from their homes to be able to work. The law led to non-whites being forcibly removed for living in the \\"wrong\\" areas. The non- white majority were given much smaller areas (e.g., Tongaat, Grassy Park) to live in than the white minority who owned most of the country. Pass Laws required non-whites to carry pass books and later 'reference books',Women's Anti-Pass Law Campaigns in South Africa http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheid/a/WomensAntiPass.htm similar to passports, to enter the 'white' parts of the country. The first Group Areas Act, the Group Areas Act, 1950 was promulgated on 7 July 1950, and it was implemented over a period of several years. It was amended by Parliament in 1952, 1955 (twice), 1956 and 1957. Later in 1957, it was repealed and re- enacted in consolidated form as the Group Areas Act, 1957, which was amended in 1961, 1962, and 1965. In 1966, that version was, in turn, repealed and re- enacted as the Group Areas Act, 1966, which was amended in 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984. It was repealed, along with many other discriminatory laws, on 30 June 1991 by the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991. Background After the 1948 general election, D.F. Malan's administration commenced its policy of apartheid that sought to segregate the races in South Africa. The government hoped to achieve this through 'separate development' of the races and this entailed passing laws that would ensure a distinction on social, economic, political and, in the case of the Group Areas Act, geographical lines.http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-separate-development-south- africa The History of Separate Development in South Africa The Group Areas Act may be regarded as an extension of the Asiatic Land Tenure Act, 1946. Nelson Mandela stated in his book, Long Walk to Freedom that \\"the Groups Areas Act was the foundation of residential apartheid. Under its regulations, each racial group could own land, occupy premises, and trade only in its own separate area. Indians could henceforth only live in Indian areas, Africans in African, Coloureds in Coloured. If whites wanted the land or houses of the other groups, they could simply declare that land a white area and take them\\".Mandela, Nelson (1994). The Long Walk to Freedom. Little Brown Book. Provisions The Act empowered the Governor-General to declare certain geographical areas to be for the exclusive occupation of specific racial groups. In particular the statute identified three such racial groups: whites, coloureds and natives. This authority was exercised on the advice of the Minister of the Interior and the Group Areas Board. Once an area had been designated for sole occupation by certain racial groups, the proclamation would not become legally effective for at least one year. Once this time had expired, it became a criminal offence to remain in occupation of property in that area with the punishment potentially being a fine and two years' imprisonment.s. 34, Group Areas Act 1950 The Act also applied to businesses with racial designation being applied on the basis of the individuals who held a controlling interest in the company. Impact left The Act became an effective tool in the separate development of races in South Africa. It also granted the Minister of the Interior a mandate to forcibly remove non-whites from valuable pieces of land so that they could become white settlements. One of the most famous uses of the Group Areas Act was the destruction of Sophiatown, a suburb of Johannesburg.http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/urban-removals-destruction- sophiatown On 9 February 1955, 2,000 policemen began removing residents to Meadowlands, Soweto and erected a new white-only area called Triomf (Victory).http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/sophiatown140206.htm#.Vbzqm_lViko Sophiatown again, 50 years on  See also  *Apartheid laws References External links  * List of apartheid-era legislation * Original copy of statute * Cape Town's District Six Museum, which examines forced removals Category:Apartheid laws in South Africa Category:1950 in South African law Category:1957 in South African law Category:1966 in South African law ","title":"Group Areas Act"},{"id":"2283518","text":"Moroka Swallows Football Club (often known as simply Swallows or The Birds) is a South African professional football club based in Soweto in the city of Johannesburg in the Gauteng province. Founded in 1947, Swallows are one of the original two Soweto clubs, together with Orlando Pirates. Until relegation in the 2014‚Äì15 season, the club had played every season of the Premier Soccer League.PSL Club Info They won the 2019‚Äì20 National First Division and will compete in the 2020‚Äì21 South African Premier Division, and play their home matches at Dobsonville Stadium. History The club was founded in the 1940s by a trio of soccer lovers, Ishmael Lesolang, Strike Makgatha, and Johnny Kubheka. They originally named the side Congregated Rovers after the firm in which most of the players and officials worked, later changing it to Moroka Rovers. But then, on 10 October 1947, the trio decided to change the name again to Moroka Swallows, basing themselves in the township formally known as Masakeng. The name has lasted for the best part of 55 years, a period which has seen consistent success both on the field and off it. The name 'moroka' means 'rain maker' in Setswana and the township was probably named after Chief Moroka of Barolong boo-Seleka who became the president of the African National Congress in 1940s. It is hardly surprising therefore that the club was renamed the 'rain bird'. The 1950s and 1960s were a successful time for the club, culminating in their greatest ever achievement, winning the South African League title in 1965. Off the field, the club was becoming a business and in 1971 they became the first ever football team to register as a public company. That same year they were also the first to receive an official sponsorship when Teljoy began their association with the club. The decade between 1982 and 1992 was a successful one for the team, culminating in four pieces of silverware. In 2007, the club celebrated its 60th anniversary. Two years later Swallows won the Nedbank Cup, the club's first piece of silverware for five years. The club narrowly avoided relegation in the 2013‚Äì14 season, finishing thirteenth. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw them relegated for the first time in their history, finishing 15th, and failing to retain their position after being defeated in the promotion-relegation playoffs. Following their first relegation from the top level, the club finished bottom of the log in the National First Division, and were relegated again to the SAFA Second Division. Prior to the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Swallows purchased the franchise of National First Division team Maccabi for R8 million, and competed in the 2019‚Äì20 National First Division. At the end 2019‚Äì20 National First Division season, the club gained promotion to the Premier Soccer League following a 3-0 win against third-placed Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila F.C., and will compete in the 2020‚Äì21 South African Premier Division.

Philosophy Heywood saw what he believed to be a disproportionate concentration of capital in the hands of a few as the result of a selective extension of government-backed privileges to certain individuals and organizations. He believed that there should be no profit in rent of buildings. He did not oppose rent, but believed that if the building was fully paid for that it was improper to charge more than what is necessary for transfer costs, insurance, and repair of deterioration that occurs during the occupation by the tenant. He even asserted that it may be incumbent on the owner of the building to pay rent to the tenant if the tenant keeps his residency in such a condition that saved it from deterioration if it were otherwise unoccupied. Heywood believed that title to unused land was a great evil. Activism Heywood's philosophy was instrumental in furthering individualist anarchist ideas through his extensive pamphleteering and reprinting of works of Josiah Warren, author of True Civilization (1869), and William B. Greene. In 1872, at a convention of the New England Labor Reform League in Boston, Heywood introduced Greene and Warren to eventual Liberty publisher Benjamin Tucker. In May, 1872 Heywood, a supporter of women's suffrage and free love activist Victoria Woodhull's free speech rights, began editing individualist anarchist magazine The Word from his home in Princeton, Massachusetts.The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism by Wendy McElroy. He was tried in 1878 for mailing \\"obscene material\\", his pamphlet Cupid's Yokes: or, The Binding Forces of Conjugal Life: An Essay to Consider Some Moral and Physiological Phases of Love and Marriage, Wherein is Asserted the Natural Right and Necessity of Sexual Self-Government, which attacked traditional notions of marriageat the instigation of postal inspector Anthony Comstock, who also had Truth Seeker editor D. M. Bennett arrested. Convicted of violating the 1873 Comstock Act, he was sentenced to two years' hard labor. Unlike Bennett, Heywood was pardoned after six months by President Rutherford B. Hayes in response to massive protests by sympathizers and free speech advocates. Arrested four more times following his release, Heywood died of tuberculosis within a year of his final release from prison. Temporal notation Heywood developed his own notation for years to be used in place of B. C. and A. D., namely B. L. and Y. L. respectively. He developed this notation on 2 July 1878 (Y. L. 6) because the A. D. notation \\"recognizes a mythical God in the , puts Christian collars marked 'J. C.' on naturally free necks, and registers us subjects of the lascivio-religious despotism which the male-sexual origin and history of the cross impose\\".E. H. Heywood, Cupid's Yokes (Princeton, Mass.: Co-operative Publishing Co.), p. 23, final note. He assigned 1873 'Y. L. 1' as that was the year of \\"the formation of the New England Free Love League in Boston\\". Y. L. is notation for 'Year of Love'. Thereafter, Heywood dated all of his correspondence and all issues of The Word with his new notation.\\"Heywood, Ezra H.\\" in The New Encyclopedia of UNBELIEF (Amherst, N. Y.: Prometheus Books, 2007), p. 389.  Personal life  Heywood met his wife Angela Heywood through her work in the abolitionist movement. They had four children together named Psyche, Angelo, Vesta, and Hermes.

Kevin Van Hentenryck stars as a normal-looking person who seeks vengeance for the unwanted surgery that separated him from his deformed conjoined twin brother. The film gained an audience in the 1980s due to the advent of home video and has been considered a cult film. The film spawned two sequels, Basket Case 2 (1990) and Basket Case 3: The Progeny (1991), which were also directed by Henenlotter. Plot Duane Bradley arrives in New York City with a locked wicker basket. After he gets a room at a cheap hotel, the contents of the basket are finally revealed: in it lives his deformed conjoined twin brother, Belial. Although conjoined at birth, the twins were surgically separated at an early age against their will, and Belial deeply resents being cut off from his normal-looking brother. As the twins seek revenge against the doctors responsible for their separation, Duane befriends a nurse, Sharon. Jealous, Belial attacks and kills her when he becomes frustrated with his inability to rape her. Enraged at his brother for his actions, Duane attempts to kill Belial, which results in the two brothers falling from a hotel window. Cast * Kevin Van Hentenryck as Duane Bradley * Terri Susan Smith as Sharon * Beverly Bonner as Casey * Robert Vogel as Hotel manager * Diana Browne as Dr. Judith Kutter * Lloyd Pace as Dr. Harold Needleman * Bill Freeman as Dr. Julius Lifflander * Joe Clarke as Brian 'Mickey' O'Donovan Production The movie was shot on 16 mm film. Director Henenlotter did not have control over the post-production, and the result was dark, murky, and converted to a different aspect ratio. The film was shot in part on Manhattan's 42nd Street. Henenlotter wrote the film as he walked around Times Square, which he called a \\"seedy, wonderful atmosphere.\\" The special effects for Belial consist largely of a puppet in some scenes and stop motion in others. When Belial's hand is seen attacking his victims, it is really a glove worn by Henenlotter. The puppet is used in scenes with an actor and where the eyes glow red. The sequence for Belial's rampage used stop motion animation.\\"In Search of Hotel Broslin\\". Basket Case DVD special features. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by Analysis Film Releasing Corporation beginning in April 1982. It played as a midnight movie for several years after this. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Basket Case holds a 77% approval rating based on 26 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.53/10. The consensus reads: \\"While Basket Case definitely delivers all the gonzo gore promised by its cracked premise, it's really set apart by its rich vein of genuine pathos.‚Äù Variety called it \\"an ultra-cheap monster film\\" with fine acting but criticized the blowup from 16 mm. David Harley of Bloody Disgusting wrote that \\"it's exactly the kind of movie it sets out to be.\\" Heather Wixson of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it an \\"insane masterpiece that lovingly celebrates the sometimes schlocky and sleazy side of cinema\\". G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk rated it 5/5 stars and called it \\"an undeniable, unavoidable and unforgettable clasSICK\\". Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"The movie is just pure shock value\\" but \\"a heck of a lot of fun.\\" John Kenneth Muir wrote that it is \\"a fine, competent low-budget effort that generates thrills and discomfort not only from its tale of symbiotic (and separated) Siamese twins, but from its authentic sense of place. New York City has never felt more delightfully and dangerously squalid.\\" Muir goes on to call it \\"oddly compelling, deeply disturbing and inexplicably touching\\". Rex Reed's quotation (\\"This is the sickest movie ever made!\\") used in promotion was not from any printed review. Reed had sought out the film after hearing negative reviews and was asked his opinion after emerging from the cinema. Unknown to Reed, the person who asked him was director Frank Henenlotter. Initially furious that his comment was used to promote the film, Reed eventually relented and granted permission. =Home media= The film was first released on DVD in the United States by Image Entertainment in 1998. This version is currently out of print. The film was re-released on special edition DVD by Something Weird Video in 2001. It was released on Blu-ray September 27, 2011. Henenlotter supervised the Blu-ray release himself and fixed many of the issues he had with previous releases. This restoration was taken from a 35mm interpositive, with the original 16mm negative, which had initially been thought lost, used as a reference. Legacy=In popular culture= Belial attacking while Colin Mochrie acts as a News Reporter Several scenes of Belial attacking people were featured in the Whose Line Is It Anyway? episode \\"Willie Robertson\\" during a segment called \\"Newsflash\\" where one of the comedians stands in front of a green screen and pretends to be a breaking news reporter reporting live. Everyone else can see what's happening behind him/her and the comedian has to guess what's happening based on clues from the other comedians who portray News Anchors.

Most commonly, the silicone oil is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the thickener is amorphous fumed silica. Using this formulation, silicone grease is a translucent white viscous paste, with exact properties dependent on the type and proportion of the components. More specialized silicone greases are made from fluorinated silicones or, for low-temperature applications, PDMS containing some phenyl substituents in place of methyl groups. Other thickeners may be used, including stearates and powdered polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE).Thorsten Bartels et al. \\"Lubricants and Lubrication\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Weinheim. . Use in industry Silicone grease is commonly used for lubricating and preserving many types of rubber parts, such as O-rings, without swelling or softening the rubber, but is contraindicated for silicone rubber due to these factors. It functions well as a corrosion inhibitor and lubricant on non-metal-metal contact areas. Silicone grease is soluble in organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, mineral spirits, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. It is insoluble in methanol, ethanol, and water. Thermal grease often consists of a silicone-grease base, along with added thermally conductive fillers. It is used for heat-transfer abilities, rather than friction reduction. Pure silicone grease is widely used by the plumbing industry in faucets and seals, as well as in dental equipment. This is due to it not being an ingestion hazard. Electrical utilities use silicone grease to lubricate separable elbows on lines that must endure high temperatures. Silicone greases generally have an operating temperature range of approximately with some high-temperature versions extending this range slightly. Use in the chemical laboratory Silicone grease is widely used as a temporary sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting ground glass joints, as is typically used in laboratory glassware. Although silicones are normally assumed to be chemically inert, several historically significant compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones.Haiduc, I., \\"Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds\\", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3‚Äì8. . The first salts of crown ethers (OSi(CH3)2)n were produced by reactions of organolithium and organopotassium compounds with silicone greases or the serendipitous reaction of stannanetriol with silicone grease to afford a cage- like compound having three Sn‚àíO‚àíSi‚àíO‚àíSn linkages in the molecule. Lubrication of an apparatus with silicone grease may result in the reaction mixture being contaminated with the grease. The impurity may be carried through purification by chromatography in undesirable amounts. In NMR spectroscopy, the methyl groups in polydimethylsiloxane display 1H and 13C chemical shifts similar to trimethylsilane (TMS), the reference compound for those forms of NMR spectroscopy. As with TMS, the signal is a singlet. In 1H NMR, silicone grease appears at a singlet at Œ¥ = 0.07 ppm in CDCl3, 0.09 in CD3CN, 0.29 in C6D6, and ‚àí0.06 ppm in (CD3)2SO. In 13C NMR, it appears at Œ¥ = 1.19 ppm in CDCl3 and 1.38 ppm in C6D6. Tables of impurities commonly found in NMR spectroscopy have been prepared, and such tables include silicone grease. Consumer uses Silicone-based lubricants are often used by consumers in applications where other common consumer lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, would damage certain products, such as latex rubber and gaskets on dry-suits. It can be used to lubricate fountain pen filling mechanisms and threads. It is used to seal and preserve O-rings in flashlights, plumbing, waterproof watches, and air rifles. Silicone grease is widely used to lubricate threads of water- submersible flashlights used for diving and spearfishing. This grease improves water resistance of the flashlights and protects threads from wearing out. Silicone grease is used with waterproof devices, as it has a very thick body and doesn't dissolve in water as most spirits and other liquids would. Various household uses include lubricating door hinges, shower heads, threads on bolts, garden-hose threads or any thread or mechanism that can be lubricated. As a sealant around electrical contacts Silicone greases are electrically insulating and are often applied to electrical connectors, particularly those containing rubber gaskets, as a means of sealing and protecting the connector. In this context they are often referred to as dielectric grease. A common use of this type is in the high-voltage connection associated with gasoline-engine spark plugs, where grease is applied to the rubber boot of the plug wire to help it slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug, to seal the rubber boot, and to prevent the rubber's adhesion to the ceramic. Such greases are formulated to withstand the high temperature generally associated with the areas in which spark plugs are located, and can be applied to contacts as well (because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film). Doing so on such high-pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the further advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration of the metals by galvanic corrosion. Silicone grease can decompose to form an insulating layer at or next to switch contacts that experience arcing, and contamination can cause the contacts to prematurely fail.

More recently, he has collaborated with Steven Wilson and Hans Zimmer. He is a noted guitar teacher, working with the UK magazine Guitar Techniques, Guildford's Academy of Contemporary Music, Lick Library, and formerly the Brighton Institute of Modern Music. Govan was named \\"Guitarist of the Year\\" by Guitarist magazine in 1993. Biography and Early Career Govan began playing guitar aged three, encouraged by his father, but initially learning mainly by ear. His father taught him three chords first, and introduced him to his record collection. Govan began listening to 1950s rock 'n' roll artists such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard; he then moved on to later eras, listening to such bands as The Beatles, Cream and Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and AC/DC, among others. He worked out chords and solos from listening to the records. Half-Scottish, Govan was also heavily influenced by Zal Cleminson, a Scottish guitarist best known for his work with the Alex Harvey Band. At the age of nine, Govan and his brother Seth played guitar on a Thames Television programme called Ace Reports. At secondary school he was exposed, via older classmates, to \\"shred\\" guitarists of the time. His first electric guitar was a Gibson SG, which he keeps at home. thumb thumb After leaving school, Govan studied English at St Catherine's College at Oxford University. He dropped out after a year to pursue a career in music. Govan states that he was torn between continuing his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter. Around this time, (by Govan's own estimation, 1991) he sent demos of his work to Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records. Varney was impressed and offered him a record deal. Govan declined, despite initiating contact in the first place. He explained that: \\"it was as though all I really wanted to know was that I was good enough [‚Ä¶] I found I was getting a bit weary of the shred movement.\\"Neville Martin, 'Guthrie Govan: Artist Interview', Guitar Techniques, November 2006, pp. 14‚Äì15 In 1993, he won Guitarist magazine's \\"Guitarist of the Year\\" competition with his instrumental piece Wonderful Slippery Thing. A version of this song was included on his debut solo album. The demo of the track earned him a place amongst several other entrants in the live final, which he then won. In the meantime, Govan hit upon the idea of transcribing music from records professionally, and submitted the most technically difficult piece he could think of (a Shawn Lane transcription) to Guitar Techniques magazine. This earned him a job as a contributor to the magazine, ending a spell working in fast food. Guitar Tuition Govan has since worked with Guitar Techniques, providing transcriptions of songs, including his own track Wonderful Slippery Thing.Guthrie Govan, \\"Guthrie Govan: Wonderful Slippery Thing\\", Guitar Techniques, April 2005, pp. 56‚Äì64 Since the late 1990s, Govan has taught at the Guitar Institute in Acton, Thames Valley University, and the Academy of Contemporary Music. He formerly taught at Brighton Institute of Modern Music, and is invited to teach in seminars, masterclasses and clinics all around the world. In this context, he is known for his ability to teach a wide range of styles. Govan has published two books on guitar playing: Creative Guitar Volume 1: Cutting Edge Techniques and Creative Guitar Volume 2: Advanced Techniques. Playing Career in the 2000s=Asia, GPS and The Young Punx= Govan began his involvement with Asia playing on the album Aura, after the band was unable to secure the services of their first two choices for guest guitarists: Brian May or Steve Lukather. Govan explained that he was then chosen as an \\"affordable\\" option for the band, which had not experienced recent chart success. With his work on the album complete, Govan was added to the Asia line-up for the tour to support the new album. He wrote an instrumental song, Bad Asteroid, which itself was based on material from Govan's early 1990s demo. He went on to play on the band's 2004 album Silent Nation. In 2006, Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes decided to reform the band with its original 3 members. Govan and two other band members, bassist/singer John Payne and Jay Schellen, along with keyboardist Erik Norlander continued under the name Asia featuring John Payne. Govan left in mid-2009. He was replaced by virtuoso guitarist Mitch Perry, known for his work with Cher, RATT, Lita Ford, and the Michael Schenker Group. Since Govan's departure from Asia featuring John Payne, they have gone on to considerable international success. Payne, Govan and Schellen also formed GPS (named after the members' initials), and after the addition of Ryo Okumoto on keyboards the band released the album Window to the Soul (2006). Most of the material on that album was written for a proposed Asia album, but was scrapped by Geoff Downes when he reunited the original line-up of Asia. Govan performs on a number of tracks on Your Music Is Killing Me, the debut album of UK electronic dance music act The Young Punx and is part of their live act. He also appears in the music video for their track Rockall. Govan has played live guitar for Dizzee Rascal, including a performance on Later With Jools Holland. =Erotic Cakes & The Fellowship= Govan's debut solo album, Erotic Cakes, was released through Cornford Records in August 2006. In the album's sleeve notes, Govan states the album is a Simpsons reference (From the Episode \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\"); he also explains that when playing live, the band is billed as Erotic Cakes rather than simply Guthrie Govan.Erotic Cakes, Cornford Records, 2006 In addition to bass by Govan's brother Seth and drumming by Pete Riley, the album features guitar solos by Richie Kotzen (whose Los Angeles studio was used to record the guitar tracks on the album) on Ner Ner and Bumblefoot on Rhode Island Shred respectively. Seth Govan and Pete Riley also complete the Erotic Cakes live band. Previous versions of Waves and Rhode Island Shred appeared on the compilation Guitar on the Edge, Vol 1. no.4 (Legato Records, 1993). A version of his Guitarist of the Year winning piece, Wonderful Slippery Thing appears on the album. While this is his first album, Govan had been collaborating with drummer Pete Riley on the music since the mid-1990s. Govan faced a set back after the albums were produced when several thousand copies of Erotic Cakes were stolen during a warehouse robbery and were never recovered, but the record company said that \\"if the thieves can sell all of the records they have a job here with us\\". The Erotic Cakes band line up, with the addition of saxophonist Zak Barrett, also forms jazz-fusion band The Fellowship. The band used to play at the Bassment club in Chelmsford, Essex, every Thursday night and did so for several years. They continue to play at the Bassment club to this day, normally just two or three times a year. Playing Career in the 2010s Govan with The Aristocrats = The Aristocrats = In late 2011, Govan announced a new tour with a new band The Aristocrats, featuring Bryan Beller on bass and Marco Minnemann on drums. Their self-titled debut album was released worldwide in September 2011, followed by Culture Clash in 2013. In January 2015 The Aristocrats released their second live CD/DVD Culture Clash Live! through all official channels and a very special so-called official self-released bootleg double CD Secret Show - Live In Osaka which was only available in their own webstore and during the live concerts at the merchandise table. (no longer available) The band's 3rd official studio album was released on 23 June 2015, and its title is Tres Caballeros. In March 2019 The Aristocrats recorded their 4th studio album (You Know What...?) in the Brotheryn Studios (Ojai, CA), which was released June 28, 2019. =Steven Wilson= Govan was the lead guitarist in Steven Wilson's band, performing on the critically acclaimed The Raven That Refused to Sing, Hand. Cannot. Erase., and 4¬Ω albums, and was a full-time touring member of Wilson's band until April 2015. These recordings captured what many agree to be some of the finest guitar playing in the history of the progressive rock genre, and introduced Govan to a broader global audience. Guthrie left Steven Wilson's band because of touring priorities with The Aristocrats whose touring schedule was clashing with Wilson's. Guthrie recommended Dave Kilminster as his replacement. =Hans Zimmer= Since 2016 Guthrie Govan is also the lead guitarist in Hans Zimmer Live live band and has toured the world with this ensemble. Hans found Guthrie on YouTube where he saw Guthrie play a fretless guitar. After some messages were exchanged on Guthrie's official Facebook page (Guthrie thought he was dealing with an imposter first, until Hans sent him his private phone number and asked Guthrie to call him), he has been part of the live band but also has been contributing already to a few Hans Zimmer soundtracks like The Boss Baby (2017), X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019) and The Lion King (2019). =Other Projects= In 2013, Govan held a guitar workshop with Paul Gilbert. He is also one of the guest stars on Michael Angelo Batio's album Intermezzo, released in November 2013. Guthrie was also a guest guitarist on one song, Electric in My Veins, in Nick Johnston's solo album, In a Locked Room on the Moon. In 2016, Govan played alongside Joe Satriani and Steve Vai in G3 2016 touring across Europe. The trek made its way through Italy and Germany and featured support from Mike Keneally on guitar, keyboards and vocals as well as Govan‚Äôs band, the Aristocrats: bassist Bryan Beller and drummer Marco Minnemann. In 2019, Govan organized the Tony Mills Festival to honor his ailing collaborator Tony Mills. Govan played a set of all Mills' originals at the festival. http://blackswan- musicschool.com/tony_mills_festival Solo Tours & Guitar Masterclasses Since 2015 Guthrie Govan has been undertaking more frequently solo tours, mostly in Asia where he has a lot of fans requesting him to perform live. He has toured extensively since then (when there were no tours scheduled with The Aristocrats or Hans Zimmer) across India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Philippines, South Korea & Japan. In India he has been using in his band drummer Gino Banks and protege bass player Mohini Dey, both high profiled players in India. For concerts in Japan he relies on protege drummer Senri Kawaguchi, keyboard player Akira Ishiguro and bassist Mohini Dey. During tours in Russia he teamed up with bassist Anton Davidyants and Hungarian drummer Gergo Borlai Guthrie is also a very in demand clinician often undertaking specialised guitar masterclasses around the globe. Influences and Technique Govan is known for his command of the guitar, due to both his technical ability and proficiency in various styles. A 2006 interview hailed him as the \\"virtuoso's virtuoso\\" and said of him, \\"Guthrie Govan is recognised by his peers as possibly the scariest guitarist alive. Combining an unparalleled technical ability with a mastery of almost all styles, Guthrie is comfortable comping in a traditional jazz combo as he is performing death- defying 'shred' guitar. Coupled with some seriously funky grooves and an encyclopaedic knowledge of popular music styles, a wonderfully developed slide style and improvisational abilities to match anyone, he may just be the most complete guitarist out there\\". Govan's earliest influences were Jimi Hendrix and Cream-era Eric Clapton; as such he describes himself as coming from a \\"blues rock background\\". While he is \\"wary\\" of 1980s technique driven guitar music (\\"shred\\") he cites the imagination of Steve Vai (as well as Frank Zappa, with whom Vai played) and the passion of Yngwie Malmsteen. Jazz and fusion elements are an important part of his style: he cites Joe Pass, Jeff Beck and John Scofield as pivotal influences in this respect. He also admires a lot of modern guitar players with different styles such as Derek Trucks and Alex Machacek. Although a very able player in a diversity of styles, Govan has a distinct playing style typically characterised by long, smooth runs often using chromatic notes to \\"fill in gaps\\", his fast and fluid tapping up and down the neck, funky slapping, and occasional use of extreme effects. Govan has said that the guitar is simply a \\"typewriter\\" for getting a musical message across. Due to his experience in listening to music and working out riffs, Govan states that he is often able to visualise playing in his head without even playing and said that he pretty much has all of the notes in his head before writing something or learning to play something to produce the sounds that he wants. Equipment An overview of all past and current gear Guthrie Govan uses. =Guitars= In October 2012, Govan was seen using a Charvel guitar on tour, it was later confirmed to be a (koa) prototype. Govan stated in January 2013 that he and Suhr parted ways officially. In July 2013, Charvel made it official that they had joined forces with Govan, who had been using their guitars for a few months. Govan's model sported a caramelised basswood body, birdseye maple top, a caramelised maple neck, Sperzel locking tuners, custom pick-ups by Michael Frank-Braun and a custom in-house developed (floating) tremolo bridge similar in design to a Floyd Rose, but without fine- tuners. In January 2014 at the NAMM Show, Charvel officially introduced the Charvel USA Guthrie Govan Signature Model in two versions: one with a Birdseye Maple top and the other with a Flame Maple top, both equipped with custom pickups. In 2017 Charvel added a newer lighter baked Ash body signature model to the GG-signature models and upgraded the former models with a single coil- humbucker switch. In the past he has used Suhr Guitars: three different Guthrie Govan Signature Model guitars, three custom Standards, a Modern 24-fret model, a Classic and Classic T. Before becoming a Suhr Guitars endorser he used a PRS guitar, as seen in many instructional videos from his early career. He also plays a Vigier fretless guitar (not endorsed). =Amplifiers= Since 2013, Govan has started using amplifiers designed and produced by Victory Amplification for both Steven Wilson and the Aristocrats tours. He has been working closely with designer Martin Kidd (who was originally the brain behind the Cornford amps) getting the V30 and V30 Mk II made the way he likes a tube amp to sound. Since 2013, Guthrie has been taking his carry-on V30 across the globe. For the Hans Zimmer tours, Govan uses a Kemper profiler, because with an orchestra on stage and using in-ears it is not advised to blast loud noises through a cabinet. In the past, Govan also has used Cornford amps. The sleeve notes of Erotic Cakes state he has used an RK100, MK50 and Hellcat. On the European tour of 2010 and 2011 he played Brunetti amplifiers (CustomWork Mercury 50) like his friend Dave Kilminster. With \\"The Aristocrats\\" he was using Suhr Badger 30 amps live, as well as a CAA PT-100 and the Badger 30 on the debut album. =Cabinets= Guthrie Govan, as stated before, uses his beloved Victory V30 MkII amplifier but to get the desired tone he prefers to use 4 x 12 cabinets with Celestion V30 Vintage speakers inside, slightly having a preference for cabinets made by Mesa (for the thick wood), Orange, Bogner. =Pedals= Govan has been an analog fan concerning pedals, but since a few years (since 2016) he has been moving towards using a Fractal FX-8 live on tours. The small footprint makes it easier traveling for a musician and the current digital solution comes extremely close to the former analog experiences. =Strings= Guthrie uses D'Addario guitar strings (NYXL 10-46) since October 2018. Before he was a Rotosound endorsed artist. \\"NYXL's last longer, are brighter and last for 4 shows\\", Guthrie said.

But immediately after eating, he felt great sorrow at having succumbed to his own physical temptations. After five continuous days of prayer, a powerful thought came to him: \\"Go into your room!\\" He obeyed the inner voice, went to the bookcase, and randomly opened a book. In the book was a piece of paper that he would later call \\"The Letter from Heaven.\\" The paper, written in Hebrew, with one line in Yiddish, is translated as follows: Odesser believed the letter to be a message of consolation, directly from Rebbe Nachman's spirit to himself here on earth. Since his name did not appear in the as the recipient, Odesser said that this was reason for every person to consider the addressed to himself or herself personally.Yisroel Saba tape recording and transcript. Odesser adopted as his personal meditation and song, and became so totally identified with it that he later said, \\"I am !\\" (This quote appears on Odesser's tombstone in Jerusalem.) Authenticity of the  A Na-Nach Breslover Hasid stands beside a van emblazoned with images of Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser and the \\"\\" phrase in downtown Jerusalem. Some Breslover Hasidim, especially prevalent among followers of competing charismatic leaders, do not use (some groups actually oppose it). Some deny its authenticity. The following are some of the diverse opinions: * Rabbi Odesser believed the \\"Letter from Heaven\\" was a genuine miracle, pointing out that the bookcase where the (note) appeared was locked at the time, and he had the only key. His followers believed in the miracle also. They continue to this day to chant the phrase as a \\"Song of Redemption\\" for the freedom from sin and restoration of the world. Odesser's personal account of how he found the Letter has been translated into English under the title The Letter from Heaven: Rebbe Nachman's Song. * Some believe that the letter was a note written to someone by Rebbe Nachman when he visited Tiberias during his pilgrimage to Israel in the early 19th century. Somehow it was placed in the old book, but Odesser's finding it was a coincidence (or miracle of timing), as was the reference to someone eating on the Fast of Tammuz. * Still others believe it was a well-intentioned forgery, written by one of Rabbi Odesser's fellow students in order to cheer him up after he became depressed from breaking his fast. Although is based on the name of Rebbe Nachman, it was unknown in his day. However, he did say that repeating one word over and over was an effective form of meditation (). His own personal phrase was (Master of the Universe) which he pronounced with the Yiddish intonation as: . Many Breslover Hasidim today still prefer this phrase, although it refers to God, not the Zaddik. =Rabbi Moshe Feinstein= In the early 1980s, Rabbi Odesser met with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who had seen the and wished to meet its owner. At the meeting, Rabbi Feinstein asked Rabbi Odesser for a blessing, and Rabbi Feinstein also called in his wife to get a blessing from Rabbi Odesser. Rabbi Feinstein gave Rabbi Odesser the following approbation: Those who doubt the authenticity of the downplay Rabbi Feinstein's approbation by saying that he was known for his loving kindness and his desire to help people. They say that all Rabbi Feinstein wrote was that the was wondrous, but he didn't verify its authenticity. Pronunciation and meaning of the phrase Vowelized graffito on Yehuda Halevi street in Tiberias. During his lifetime, Rebbe Nachman spoke of a \\"Song of Redemption\\" that would be revealed before the coming of the Jewish Messiah. This song would be in a \\"single, double, triple, quadruple\\" form. (). The phrase has such a structure (keeping in mind that Hebrew often omits the vowels) and is based on the Rebbe's name, \\"Nachman\\": * (One Hebrew letter: Nun) ‚Äî * (Two Hebrew letters: Nun-Chet) ‚Äî * (Three Hebrew letters: Nun-Chet-Mem) ‚Äî * (Four Hebrew letters: Nun-Chet-Mem-Nun) ‚Äî * (a double entendre: it can mean \\"from Uman\\", Rebbe Nachman's burial place, and can also mean \\"believed\\" or \\"accredited\\".) ‚Äî The phrase is pronounced with a soft A sound as in \\"ah\\" and a guttural KH sound as in German \\"ach.\\" It is usually accented as follows: . Speakers of Yiddish have also noted that can mean \\"now to,\\" which would loosely translate the phrase as \\"Now to Nachman from Uman,\\" that is, traveling to the Rebbe on pilgrimage to his gravesite or in one's heart. Popularity of the phrase today Whatever the origins of this phrase, it is now very popular among a subgroup group of Breslover Hasidim who follow Rabbi Odesser, who are colloquially known as the Na Nachs. The name has been incorporated into both traditional and contemporary Jewish music, appeared on bumper stickers, billboards and public graffiti throughout Israel, and is used on jewellery and amulets. Among some groups of Sephardic Jewish youth in Israel, it has become a sort of rallying cry for returning to traditional Judaism, although not necessarily to mainstream Breslov. Typical white \\"Na Nacher\\" style yarmulke with the phrase woven into it, made in Jerusalem in 2005 More recently, some people have begun to wear the words of the phrase crocheted on large, white yarmulkes with a little tassel on top. (These hats are a modification of a traditional white yarmulke that has been worn in Jerusalem for centuries. That style, in turn, apparently evolved from the medieval Jewish hat with the ball on top -- hence the tassel.) When Rabbi Odesser was still alive, some of his followers were already wearing large white yarmulkes, but without the phrase on them. Today, the make this crocheted yarmulke part of their uniform attire. yarmulkes in other colors are also appearing on the market and are a popular item for Purim.

He led the Browns to their most recent National Football League title in 1964. Early years Ryan played football while attending R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He was recruited by college coaches from across the country, including Bear Bryant, and he was admitted to Yale University. Ryan declared a major in physics at Rice University(which at that time was still called -- until 1960 -- The Rice Institute) [For more details, see pages 220 and 221 (internally labeled \\"Chapter 9\\" and \\"[page] 197\\") of this archival document; ...which was found \\"VIA\\" footnote number \\"[1]\\" [q.v.] of this specific version of the Wikipedia article about The Rice Institute.], becoming the first in his family not to go to Yale. He was unable to establish himself during the course of his collegiate career, splitting time behind center with King Hill, who was receiving most of the snaps. Given his desire to obtain a Ph.D., Ryan originally decided not to play professional football after the Los Angeles Rams chose him in the fifth round of the 1958 NFL Draft. He changed his mind after he was able to enroll at both UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley in pursuit of an advanced degree. Ryan then transferred back to Rice, where he studied during the off-season. NFL career=Los Angeles Rams= Ryan spent the first four years of his career primarily in a reserve capacity, making $12,000 per year. He did start a handful of games in competition with Billy Wade and Zeke Bratkowski. In 1961, he and future Hall of Famer Ollie Matson connected on a 96-yard touchdown reception, establishing a new team record. However, after sitting on the bench for the last four games of the 1961 season, Ryan stormed into the dressing room and threatened General Manager Elroy Hirsch that he was going to quit football if he were not traded. He became part of a multi-player deal with the Cleveland Browns on July 12, 1962, his 26th birthday, as the arrival of highly touted newcomer Roman Gabriel made Ryan expendable. =Cleveland Browns=1962‚Äì1963 Acquired to back up starting quarterback Jim Ninowski, Ryan moved into the starting slot on October 28 when Ninowski broke his collarbone while being tackled by Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive lineman Eugene \\"Big Daddy\\" Lipscomb. With no other candidates to compete with, Ryan established his leadership and held on to the starting role for much of the next six seasons. In his first full season as a starter, 1963, Ryan threw for 2,026 yards and 25 touchdowns with only 13 interceptions, helping the Browns to a 10‚Äì4 record. Thirteen of those touchdowns went to Gary Collins, who tied for the league lead in receiving touchdowns that year. 1964 In 1964, Ryan established himself as one of the league's best passers. He threw for 2,404 yards and repeated his 1963 performance by completing 25 touchdown passes, which was enough to lead the league. Ryan had excellent company on the Browns offense: fullback Jim Brown; wide receivers Gary Collins and Paul Warfield; and an outstanding offensive line which included Dick Schafrath, John Morrow, John Wooten, Monte Clark, and future Hall of Famer Gene Hickerson. But Ryan was also a clutch performer during the Browns‚Äô memorable 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 season. Needing a win in the December 12 regular season finale against the New York Giants to clinch a berth in the NFL title game, Ryan completed 12 of 13 passes for five touchdowns and ran for a sixth touchdown in the 52‚Äì20 win. Two weeks later in the championship game against the Baltimore Colts, Ryan hit Collins for three touchdowns to win the title, 27‚Äì0. Ryan was rewarded for his performance with the first of three straight Pro Bowl appearances. Unfortunately, on the first play of the second half, he suffered a severe shoulder injury in the game after the combined 800-pound trio of Packer Willie Davis, Lion Roger Brown and Colt Gino Marchetti converged on the signal caller. Speculation persists to this day that Marchetti went out of his way to injure Ryan due to the perception that the quarterback ran up the score in the championship, with Marchetti's statement that he wanted \\"one more shot\\" at Ryan also fueling the rumors. However, a study of the film by Cleveland coaches in the weeks after the game exonerated Marchetti. After winning the championship, Art Modell raised his salary $25,000, up from about $18,000 per season. 1965 Ryan's numbers dropped in 1965, throwing for only 1,751 yards and 18 touchdowns. While his shoulder had completely healed, a sore elbow in training camp and an injured arch early in the regular season played a role in his completing fewer than half of his passes during the campaign. Those struggles resulted in a continuing cool relationship with Browns' fans, who booed him often during home contests. Part of Ryan's decline can also be traced to the absence of second-year wide receiver Paul Warfield, who missed much of the season after suffering a double fracture of the collarbone in the team's first exhibition game. 1966 In 1966, he bounced back with a superb season, leading the league with 29 touchdown passes and finishing second with 2,976 yards despite playing with intense pain. Ryan's output helped alleviate the absence of the legendary Jim Brown, who had retired prior to the start of training camp. His 29 touchdown passes in 14 games ranks second in Browns franchise history to Brian Sipe, who got 30 in a 16-game 1980 season. 1967 On January 25, 1967, Ryan underwent an operation to repair the remaining effects of his injury. The surgery eliminated the pain, but also affected his throwing motion. In the 1967 season opener, Ryan's injury woes continued as he sprained both ankles in a 21‚Äì14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Battling through that malady, along with shoulder and knee troubles, Ryan led the team to a 9‚Äì5 record to reach the playoffs. The season would see Ryan having a concussion from a head-to-head collision with Dick Butkus. He was knocked out in the second-quarter but came back to throw three touchdown passes in the third quarter to will his team to a 24‚Äì0 victory. Ryan credits this collision for the cervical disc replacement he underwent after retiring. 1968 Ryan's tenure as the Browns' starting quarterback came to an abrupt end following a 1‚Äì2 start to the 1968 season. Browns' head coach Blanton Collier replaced Ryan with Bill Nelsen, who went on to lead the team to a division title. The official conclusion of Ryan's time with the Browns came on September 9, 1969, when he was released, but new Redskins' coach Vince Lombardi quickly signed Ryan as a backup. =Washington Redskins= Despite throwing only one pass during the 1969 season, Ryan returned for the last of his 13 years in the NFL in 1970 before officially announcing his retirement on April 13, 1971. With his accurate throwing arm, his 14.7 yards per completion still ranks as one of the all-time leaders. Academic career Ryan attended graduate school during the first part of his playing career, and in 1965, he earned his Ph.D. from Rice. He worked for seven postgraduate years under Dr. G. R. MacLane, one of the best geometric-function theorists, and produced the dissertation \\"Characterization of the Set of Asymptotic Values of a Function Holomorphic in the Unit Disc.\\" In 1966, Ryan published two fundamental papers on the set of asymptotic values of a function holomorphic in the unit disc in Duke Mathematical Journal. He started teaching at Rice during his career and, during his time with the Browns, he became an assistant professor at the Case Institute of Technology in February 1967. Ryan had a full teaching load, which includes undergraduate and graduate courses, and conducting research in complex analysis.Mathematical Reviews profile, Author ID=530280 While at training camp, Ryan taught math in the morning and went to football practice in the afternoon. Ryan taught his last course at Case Western Reserve in the spring of 1971. He was promoted to associate professor that summer. After taking a leave of absence for the next three years, he resigned his faculty position in 1974. Ryan learned computer programming and software through the Chi Corp., Case Western Reserve's then newly launched private computer company. He compiled advanced statistics to apply what he learned to football. The Browns were shown his results and liked the project but didn't offer the extra cash to move it forward. Ryan's second career was fodder for many jokes by sportswriters. Red Smith wrote that the Browns' offense consisted of a quarterback who understood Einstein's theory of relativity and ten teammates who didn't know there was one. Ryan was somewhat put off by the focus on his academic life, as he considered himself to be a regular football player. Ryan considers Sir Edward Collingwood, an expert in meromorphic function and the theory of cluster sets, and Arthur J. Lohwater, the former editor of Mathematical Reviews, as mentors. Ryan has an Erd≈ës number of 3.https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html Post-NFL career Soon after his retirement from the Redskins, Ryan remained in the nation's capital when he was named director of information services for the U.S. House of Representatives. While there, he helped advance the computer age in politics by playing an integral role in establishing the body's first electronic voting system. This enabled voting procedures that usually ran for 45 minutes to be shortened to around 15 minutes. By the time he left the post, the office had an annual budget of $8 million with a staff of 225. Ryan resigned that post to become athletic director and lecturer in mathematics at Yale University on March 7, 1977. Ryan served in that position for ten years before resigning to become the school's associate vice president for institutional planning. He was a member of the Rice board of governors from 1972 to 1976 and was recognized as a distinguished alumnus in 1987. Ryan became vice president for external affairs at Rice in August 1990, increasing annual gifts to the university to a three-year average of $32.8 million for the fiscal years 1992‚Äì94 from $21.4 million for the fiscal years 1988‚Äì90. In 1995, he resigned his post as vice president for external affairs at Rice, owing to differences with President Malcolm Gillis concerning the future course of external affairs. Ryan ended his institutional career as a professor of mathematics, and professor of computational and applied mathematics at Rice. Ryan was president and chief executive officer of Contex Electronics, which designed and manufactured cable and interconnect products for the computer and communications industries. Ryan also served as director for America West Airlines, Sequoia Voting Systems, and of Danielson Holding Corporation. He was an advisory director of United Medical Care Inc. Now retired, Ryan lives on 78 acres of heavily forested land in Grafton, Vermont, with his wife, Joan, a retired sportswriter and nationally syndicated columnist for The Washington Post. His wife was one of the first female sportswriters to ever grace a locker room (not to be confused with another sportswriter named Joan Ryan) and also wrote a book on women in sports. The two Texans met in college, fell in love with Vermont while Ryan was on staff at Yale, and have been married since their senior year at Rice. In retirement, he now runs a sophisticated self-designed program that helps micro-analyze statistical behavior of the up-and-down pricing movement that underlies the pricing behavior of the futures market. He is also doing work on Oppermann's conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers. Statistics Ryan ranks fourth all-time among Browns quarterbacks with 13,499 passing yards and second behind Brian Sipe with 134 touchdowns. His 81.43 passer rating is third-best, behind Milt Plum and Bernie Kosar. Ryan's career numbers (including years with the Rams and Redskins): 1,090 completions in 2,133 attempts for 16,044 yards, 149 touchdowns and 111 interceptions. Ryan also rushed for 1,358 yards and six touchdowns on 310 carries.

How it works  An infrared laser is directed through a window into the vacuum of the mass spectrometer where the ions are. The mechanism of fragmentation involves the absorption by a given ion of multiple infrared photons. The parent ion becomes excited into more energetic vibrational states until a bond(s) is broken resulting in gas phase fragments of the parent ion. In the case of powerful laser pulses, the dissociation proceeds via inner-valence ionization of electrons. IRMPD is most often used in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.  Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy  By applying intense tunable IR lasers, like IR-OPOs or IR free electron lasers, the wavelength dependence of the IRMPD yield can be studied. This infrared photodissociation spectroscopy allows for the measurement of vibrational spectra of (unstable) species that can only be prepared in the gas phase. Such species include molecular ions but also neutral species like metal clusters that can be gently ionized after interaction with the IR light for their mass spectrometric detection. Isotope separation Due to the relatively large differences in IR absorption frequencies that are due to different resonance frequencies for molecules containing different isotopes, this technique has been suggested as a way to perform Isotope separation with difficult-to-separate isotopes, in a single pass. For example, molecules of UF6 containing U-235 might be ionized completely as a result of such a laser resonance, leaving UF6 containing the heavier U-238 intact.

History Faced with burgeoning stock populations in the Pemberton-Lillooet and Gang Ranch areas and a lack of easy access to the huge market supplying meat to construction crews of the Canadian Pacific Railway just east, largely because of a lack of bridge crossings of the Fraser River, the ranchers of the Lillooet area lobbied the provincial government, and MLA Humphreys, to finance a trail to the coast via the Pemberton and Squamish areas to the north shore of Burrard Inlet (i.e. what is now Vancouver harbour), at the mouth of the Seymour River. The track was started and followed a gold rush of 1862 route through the Seymour Watershed over to Mamquam and Indian Rivers to Squamish, and to follow a path, taken much later by the PGE, to the Lillooet area. Work crews started hacking and building in 1874 with the trail \\"finished' in 1877. The trail's route was improbable, to say the least, hugging lakeside cliffs where, in places, trestles and floating platforms had to be built out above or onto the lake and, beyond that, through marshes and heavy forests beset by infamously thick mosquitos and, lastly, a tortuous \\"stairway\\" section of the trail over the pass between the Squamish area and the head of the Seymour River, where cattle were expected to use steps on a trail that was nowhere more than 6 yards wide. Only one formal cattle drive was ever held over the full length of the route and most head were lost; those that finished the trip were put out to pasture to recuperate, being too skinny to be worth butchering. The multi-thousand-dollar loss incurred by trail construction left a bad taste with the provincial government for many years, although the son of its main sponsor, a rancher from Pavilion, later became provincial Minister of Highways and Public Works. Bridges to serve the cattle ranches of the West Fraser, including the suspension-span at Lillooet, were built in several places by the 1910s, although too late to keep the West Fraser Ranches competitive with those in the Thompson and Cariboo regions. The trail remained in use in later years for residents of the Pemberton Valley for general travel purposes, and at least two more smaller cattle drives from that region to Squamish were attempted, both financial disasters as was the original one from Lillooet. The roadbed of the trail remained in place for many years, its stretch from Pemberton to Squamish ultimately being subsumed into the grade for the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway through that stretch. Route Basically the route started from North Vancouver to Lillooet. The trail went through Britannia, Squamish, Garibaldi to Pemberton. From here it followed the Douglas road, but at this time the water routes were replaced with roads and the trail made it all the way to Lillooet.

About 25% of the parish is wooded foothill slopes of the South Downs which is the area north of the A27 here. The 2001 Census recorded 173 people lived in 75 households, of whom 96 were economically active. At the 2011 Census the population had risen only marginally to 174. The small village has two Grade I Listed buildings: the Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas, (in whose churchyard the cricketer Colin Cowdrey is buried), and some remains of St John's Priory (founded by the Knights Hospitallers) beside the main road. Many of the cottages are Grade II listed. History Poling was an agricultural part of the Rape of Arundel, one of the traditional sub-divisions of Sussex and a former Norman barony. In the Anglo-Saxon era Poling, like most coastal villages, had outlying areas of land in the Weald (forest) within Sussex used for summer grazing and timber production. Thus Poling gave its name to Pallingham north of Stopham and Pallinghurst west of Rudgwick. Poling also had land north of Petworth, then known as \\"Palinga Schittas\\", mentioned in a charter of AD 953. in connection with the pannage of pigs to feed on acorns.Jerrome, 2002, page 15 Parish church St. Nicholas' parish church is on the south-east edge of the village next to Manor Farm and is reached by a footpath from Poling Street, next to the Old Vicarage. Burials in St. Nicholas' churchyard include the Kent and MCC cricketer and cricket administrator Colin Cowdrey (1932‚Äì2000) and the explorer, botanist, artist and colonial administrator Sir Harry Johnston (1858‚Äì1927). Johnston is also commemorated by a wall plaque in the nave carved by the Arts and Crafts sculptor and typeface designer Eric Gill, who lived at Ditchling, East Sussex. The main typeface used on the plaque seems to be Gill's Perpetua, which he designed in 1925 but did not release until 1929.

Critics In February 2014, at Apple Inc.'s annual shareholder meeting, a proposal by the NCPPR as a shareholder to force Apple to \\"disclose the costs of its sustainability programs\\" was rejected by 97% vote. The NCPPR representative argued that Apple's decision to have all of its power come from green sources would lower shareholders' profits. CEO Tim Cook \\"categorically rejected the worldview behind the NCPPR's advocacy. He said that there are many things Apple does because they are right and just, and that a return on investment (ROI) was not the primary consideration on such issues...When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don't consider the bloody ROI... If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.\\" Virgin's CEO Richard Branson wrote an article supporting Cook's stance and criticizing the NCPPR stance on climate change. Branson argued that \\"If 97% of climate scientists agreeing that climate-warming trends over the past century are due to human activities isn‚Äôt compelling data, I don‚Äôt know what is.\\" An article in the San Francisco Chronicle in 1998 described the NCPPR's \\"legal but controversial\\" computer-generated \\"fright mail\\" campaign which targeted millions of seniors, according to the American Association of Retired Persons spokesman, Greg Marchildon. Controversies Disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff was a member of NCPPR's Board of Directors; he resigned in October 2004 after NCPPR's Board of Directors concluded he had violated the organization's conflict of interest policy. In October 2002, Abramoff directed the Mississippi Band of Choctaws to give $1 million to NCPPR, and then told Amy Ridenour to distribute the funds to Capital Athletic Foundation ($450,000), Capitol Campaign Strategies ($500,000) and Nurnberger and Associates ($50,000). In June 2003, Greenberg Traurig, the firm that employed Abramoff, sent $1.5 million to NCPPR, of which Ridenour distributed $250,000 to Capital Athletic Foundation and the remainder to Kay Gold LLC, both controlled by Abramoff. Ridenour said in testimony that she believed Abramoff co-conspirator Michael Scanlon was the owner of Kay Gold (Kaygold).

He is the University of Miami's first Hispanic and native Spanish- speaking president. Frenk formerly served as dean of the faculty and T & G Angelopoulos professor of public health and international development at the Harvard School of Public Health, from 2009 to 2015, where he had been the university's first Hispanic and native Spanish-speaking dean. Early life and education Frenk was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on December 20, 1953. His father and grandfather, a Jew who fled to Mexico from Nazi Germany, were both physicians. He received his medical degree, in 1979, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and went on to obtain three additional advanced degrees: a Master of Public Health (1981), a Master of Arts in sociology (1982), and a joint Doctor of Philosophy in medical care organization and in sociology (1983), from the University of Michigan. Career Secretary Frenk with President Vicente Fox and Reyes Tamez, Secretary of Education, in Los Pinos during the initialing ceremony of the National Institute of Genomic Medicine His professional career began in 1984, when Frenk assumed the position of founding director of the Centre of Public Health Research, Ministry of Health of Mexico, a role he held until 1987. Following that appointment, he went on to serve as the founding director- general of the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, from 1987 to 1992. From 1995 to 1998, he served as the executive vice president of the Mexican Health Foundation, a private non-profit organization, and the director of its Centre for Health and the Economy. In 1998, he was designated executive director of evidence and information for policy at the World Health Organization (WHO), in Geneva, Switzerland. Following the election of Vicente Fox in Mexico's 2000 presidential election, Frenk was appointed minister of health of Mexico, a position he held until December 2006. Following his service as minister of health, Frenk was tapped to serve as senior fellow in the global health program of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation where he counseled the foundation on global health issues and strategies. In addition to his many executive positions, Frenk has served in several academic roles including, senior researcher at the National Institute of Public Health and adjunct professor at the faculty of medicine of the National University of Mexico. He was also awarded the position of national researcher. In 1992‚Äì1993, he was visiting professor at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. He is the author of 28 books and monographs and many articles in academic journals, as well as in cultural magazines and newspapers. He is also a member of the editorial boards of ten international journals and a member of twelve scientific and professional associations, including the National Academy of Medicine of Mexico and the United States Institute of Medicine. In 2003, while serving as secretary of health of Mexico, Frenk introduced Seguro Popular, a program of comprehensive national health insurance which expanded access to health care for tens of millions of previously uninsured Mexicans. One test of any national healthcare delivery program is its durability after the key architects of the plan are no longer in power; Seguro Popular is still operating in late 2016.Seguro Popular website, accessed 11/30/2016 In 2004, Frenk was criticized by tobacco control advocates for cutting an unusual deal with tobacco companies. Philip Morris and British America Tobacco agreed to donate $400 million for health programs in Mexico over 2¬Ω years, but reserved the right to cancel the donation if cigarette taxes were raised. On July 2005, Frenk met the opposition of Interior Secretary Carlos Abascal, a conservative Catholic, because of the decision of the Ministry of Health to distribute the morning-after pill at government health clinics. Julio Frenk is officially installed as the 6th president of the University of Miami on January 29, 2016 In September 2006, the Mexican government put Frenk's name forward as a candidate for the vacant position of director-general of the World Health Organization.

SS career Barkmann joined the Nazi Party on 1 September 1938 and served in the Reich Labour Service from November 1938 to March 1939. After this he joined the SS on 1 April 1939, and served during the occupation of Poland. He was posted for a time as an instructor of SS volunteers in the Netherlands. In winter 1942/43 he was posted to the SS Division Das Reich on the Eastern Front, with which he took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov. In February 1944, Das Reich was ordered to France to form a part of the 5th Panzer Army, the armoured reserve for the expected Allied invasion. Following Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of June 1944, the division reached the front in early July and fought against the American forces near Saint-L√¥. Barkmann was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Barkmann participated in the Ardennes Offensive in December 1944 and the fighting on the Eastern Front in the spring of 1945. Barkmann and his crew were credited with the destruction of at least 82 Soviet, British and US tanks, 136 miscellaneous armoured fighting vehicles and 43 anti-tank guns. Disputed actions Barkmann's reputed actions in Normandy were challenged by the military historian Steven Zaloga in his 2015 work Armored Champion: The Top Tanks of World War II.

Dolphin and Union Strait lies in both the Northwest Territories (Inuvik Region) and Nunavut (Kitikmeot Region), Canada, between the mainland and Victoria Island. It links Amundsen Gulf, lying to the northwest, with Coronation Gulf, lying to the southeast. The southeastern end of the strait is marked by Austin Bay. It gets its name from the two boats used by John Richardson who first explored it in 1826. The Inuit who use this area have been variously known as the Copper Inuit, the Copper Eskimos, or the \\"People at the end of the world,\\" because few other Indigenous groups had continuously used the area before. This is partly why the first explorers who ventured into this awe-inspiring, lethally-formidable landscape, were amazed by the \\"blond\\" Inuit they had encountered. There are several islands within the strait, including the Liston and Sutton Islands, historically home to the Noahonirmiut band of Copper Inuit. The strait is about long and ranges from in width. When frozen, it is used by Barren-ground caribou, known the Dolphin and Union herd, to reach Victoria Island for the summer and to return to the mainland for the winter. Eider ducks are also found in the strait. The caribou are known locally as tuktu which is understood across the circumpolar world. Conversely, eider ducks are called kingalik which means, simply, \\"big-nose\\". In recent decades, the local Inuvialuit have seen the reduction in average winter sea-ice thickness from roughly in the early 1960s to about even in the dead of winter today. There is also a preponderance of new species from flies to wasps, and new birds arriving that have never been seen before; grizzlies roam where they were once that most rare curiosity.

In 1963 he played the extremely reluctant hero Vadassy forced into espionage in Epitaph For a Spy for BBC Television. In 1966 Jeavons portrayed Uriah Heep in the BBC's David Copperfield. He appeared in a host of 1960s and 1970s TV programmes including Doctor Who (in \\"The Underwater Menace\\"), Adam Adamant Lives! as a murderous fashion designer, as the undertaker Shadrack in Billy Liar (1973), as businessman Leonard Gold in The Sweeney (in the 1978 episode \\"The Bigger They Are\\") , as shop owner Ellery in Shoestring in the episode \\"Where was I?\\" (1980) and The Avengers (in \\"A Touch of Brimstone\\" and \\"The Winged Avenger\\"). Pete Stampede and Alan Hayes wrote of Jeavons in the latter series as \\"one of those under-rated, ever-present supporting actors who never turn in a bad performance.\\" On children's TV, he hosted Play School for a time, and read \\"The Black Vicar\\" on Jackanory. He also appeared in the 1981 Doctor Who spin-off K-9 and Company, and he narrated two BBC children's animated series, namely Barnaby and Joe. He appeared in the 1978 Play For Today production of David Edgar's 1978 play about British neo-Nazis, Destiny. The same year he played the part of Mr Johnson, a schoolteacher, in Peter McDougall's BBC supernatural drama Tarry-Dan Tarry-Dan Scarey Old Spooky Man. In 1979 he appeared as Samson Brass in another BBC Dickens production, The Old Curiosity Shop, and then in their 1981 remake of Great Expectations, this time as Wemmick. The same year he played a recurring UFO-obsessed character in the sci-fi comedy Kinvig. His most critically acclaimed role during this period was as the neglected and abused child, Donald, in Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills (1979). In the 1980s he was involved with two dramatisations of Sherlock Holmes stories. He played \\"with chilling authority\\" in the words of writer David Stuart Davies, Professor Moriarty in The Baker Street Boys (1982), and \\"with great panache\\" Inspector Lestrade in the Granada Television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (featuring Jeremy Brett as Holmes). Producer Michael Cox of the Granada Television series for Sherlock Holmes stated frankly that they were given the best Lestrade of his generation.Afterword written by Michael S. Cox, Cheshire, 1993, in \\"The Television Sherlock Holmes\\" by Peter Haining, revised 3rd Edition, 1994 Virgin Books In the 1981 TV production of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he portrayed Max Quordlepleen, an entertainer who hosts at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Jeavons was Briggs, the lawyer who halts the marriage between Jane and Rochester, in the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre. In 1984, he played the existentialist philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard in the \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" episode of Don Cupitt's Sea of Faith for BBC. The following year he played Adolf Hitler in Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil. He played the solicitor Vholes in the 1985 BBC adaptation of Bleak House. In 1986 he was seen in Paradise Postponed. He featured in the 1990 television drama House of Cards by Michael Dobbs, as Tim Stamper, Tory Whip and ally of Ian Richardson's Francis Urquhart. The character returned - promoted initially to Chief Whip, then to Party Chairman - in the 1993 sequel, To Play the King. Jeavons played Del Boy's lawyer, Solly Atwell, in Only Fools And Horses. He also played the role of Genrikh Yagoda in the 1992 television film Stalin. He also appeared in a number of films over the years, often as priests or vicars. These included roles in The Devil's Daffodil (1961), Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), The Other People (1968), The Oblong Box (1969), The Games (1970), Bartleby (1970), Diagnosis: Murder (1975), Schizo (1976), The Island (1980), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), Absolute Beginners (1986) and Secret Friends (1991). Jeavons retired from acting in 1993. Personal life Jeavons' elder son Barney managed the British rock band Reuben, and in 2007 Jeavons emerged from retirement, heavily bearded, to appear as the enigmatic General in Reuben's Rock video \\"Blood, Bunny, Larkhall\\". In a behind-the- scenes short, Jeavons explained briefly some of the highlights of his acting career. Barney Jeavons is the former Arts Centre Director of the West End Centre in Aldershot.

Scientific work  While Marsh was most famous for inventing the test that bears his name, he was also a skilled and inventive scientist who held the post of Ordnance Chemist at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. He developed the screw time fuze for mortar shells and in 1830 the percussion tube. In 1832 HMS Castor was the first ship to have her guns modified with these innovations. They were not approved for the Army until 1845, when Woolwich began their manufacture‚Äîfor coastal artillery only. They became obsolete in 1866. Marsh also worked as an assistant to Michael Faraday at the nearby Royal Military Academy from 1829 to 1846. Marsh invented the earliest form of vibrating electrical interrupter in 1824. It consisted of a straight wire electrically connected and flexibly suspended at the top while the lower end extending into a shallow mercury filled trough which served as a second electrical contact. The lower end of the wire was also positioned between the poles of a powerful permanent horseshoe-shaped magnet. When electric current flowed through the wire, the magnetic field of the wire created a force with the field of the permanent magnet such that the wire would rotate out of the mercury trough and interrupt the electrical circuit. Without the magnetic force, the wire would then fall back due to the force of gravity into the mercury thereby restoring the connection and restarting the cycle of vibration. In 1832 Marsh was called as a chemist by the prosecution in a murder trial, wherein a certain John Bodle was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with hydrogen sulfide and hydrochloric acid. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow arsenic trisulfide, when it came to showing it to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt. Annoyed by this, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with sulfuric acid and arsenic-free zinc, resulting in arsine gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit. So sensitive was the test that it could detect as little as one-fiftieth of a milligram of arsenic. He first described this test in The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal in 1836.

Jonathan Casey). To date, they have released five studio albums, including a ten-year retrospective, and six EPs/singles. The group have produced a number of club classics which include the tracks \\"Hardcore Motherfucker\\" and \\"Psycho Drama\\" and have been recognised as being at the 'forefront of the UK Industrial-Cyber scene'. The Ultraviolence sound incorporates elements from various styles including hardcore techno/gabber, breakbeat hardcore, industrial techno, power noise, metal and rap. A substantial body of the Ultraviolence releases received positive critical reception since the first album Life of Destructor gaining '5Ks' from Kerrang! magazine. In 2004 Ultraviolence released a retrospective two CD album titled Blown Away 1994-2004. Violent has worked with several female vocal artists on different releases, but as of 2005, singer and angle grinding stage performer Mel Allezbleu has become a permanent member of the band. History Casey first experimented in making electronic music in his teens. After attending Goldsmiths College in London for a diploma in sound engineering and working in a record shop, he tried his hand at gigging locally with a college friend. He got into production in a serious way in late 1990 and adopted the name Johnny Violent (aka Ultraviolence) in reference to the film A Clockwork Orange. He saved up money for some studio time and recorded and handful of tracks including \\"You'll Never Sleep Tonight\\" which was played by John Peel on BBC Radio 1 and gained the attention of London label Food Records, who signed Violent in 1992. The relationship between Ultraviolence and the trendy, indie-orientated Food Records was never likely to be a happy one and soon dissolved. It was 1994 before the debut album Life of Destructor was released on Nottingham's Earache Records label. Earache had been previously known for releasing extreme heavy metal acts such as Carcass and Napalm Death. Nevertheless, the relationship between Violent and Earache's label owner Digby Pearson proved a fruitful and durable one over the next decade. It was the second album, Psycho Drama (1996), that made critics start to believe there was more to the act than pure noise terror. Highly ambitious in concept and execution, Psycho Drama was a full-length gabber \\"opera\\", telling the tortured love story of the \\"Hitman\\" and \\"Jessica\\" characters. In 1995, Ultraviolence toured the US with fellow UK industrialists Cubanate. However, the limitations of Violent's one-man stage shows were becoming apparent and American audiences never quite took to Ultraviolence like Techno-aware European crowds. From this point on, Violent usually appeared on-stage backed by various singers, dancers and showers of sparks from male or female angle-grinders. The third album, 1998's Killing God marked a new transition to a new, more commercial Ultraviolence sound, dubbed \\"happy hardcore\\" by some, although the lyrical themes remained as bleak as ever. The album contained a cover of the Black Sabbath classic song \\"Paranoid\\". In 2001, the fourth Ultraviolence album, Superpower was released, again groping for a wider market.

Structure It arises from the inferior mental spine, on the back of the mandibular symphysis, and runs backward and slightly downward, to be inserted into the anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone. It lies in contact with its fellow of the opposite side. It thus belongs to the suprahyoid muscles. The muscle is supplied by branches of the lingual artery. =Innervation= The geniohyoid muscle is innervated by fibres from the first cervical nerve travelling alongside the hypoglossal nerve. Although the first three cervical nerves give rise to the ansa cervicalis, the geniohyoid muscle is said to be innervated by the first cervical nerve, as some of its efferent fibers do not contribute to ansa cervicalis. =Variations= It may be blended with the one on opposite side or double; slips to greater cornu of hyoid bone and genioglossus occur. Function The geniohyoid muscle brings the hyoid bone forward and upwards. This dilates the upper airway, assisting respiration. During the first act of deglutition, when the mass of food is being driven from the mouth into the pharynx, the hyoid bone, and with it the tongue, is carried upward and forward by the anterior bellies of the Digastrici, the Mylohyoidei, and Geniohyoidei.

It is named after its two attachments near the molar teeth (\\"mylo\\" comes from the Greek word for \\"molar\\").http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/glossary/glossary.cgi?page=m These muscles are mesodermal in embryologic origin. The mylohyoid muscle is derived from the first pharyngeal arch. It forms the floor of the submental triangle. Structure The mylohyoid muscle is flat and triangular, and is situated immediately superior to the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. It is a pharyngeal muscle (derived from the first pharyngeal arch) and classified as one of the suprahyoid muscles. Together, the paired mylohyoid muscles form a muscular floor for the oral cavity of the mouth. The two mylohyoid muscles arise from the mandible at the mylohyoid line, which extends from the mandibular symphysis in front to the last molar tooth behind. The posterior fibers pass inferomedially and insert at anterior surface of the hyoid bone. The medial fibres of the two mylohyoid muscles unite in a midline raphe (where the two muscles intermesh). The mylohyoid muscle separates the sublingual space from the submandibular space, which communicate via a lateral gap between the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles at the posterior free margin of mylohyoid muscle. The submandibular gland wraps around the edges of the mylohyoid, and is divided into superficial and deep lobes above and below the muscle. =Innervation= The mylohyoid muscle is innervated by a branch of the mandibular nerve, the inferior alveolar nerve. The mylohyoid nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve. The mylohyoid nerve emerges to give motor supply to the mylohyoid muscle. =Variations= The mylohyoid may be united to or replaced by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle; accessory slips to other hyoid muscles are frequent. This median raph√© is sometimes absent; the fibers of the two muscles are then continuous. An area of herniation of the sublingual gland, blood vessels, or fat, may be present, with studies reporting this in 10-50% of people. Function The mylohyoid elevates the hyoid and the tongue. This is particularly important during swallowing and speaking. Alternatively, if other muscles are used to keep the position of the hyoid fixed, then the mylohyoid depresses the mandible. It also functions as reinforcing the floor of mouth. Clinical relevance The mylohyoid may be imaged by CT or MRI. The mylohyoid separates the submandibular space below from the sublingual space above. Around the posterior border of mylohoid, these spaces communicate. Infections, especially odontogenic infections can spread from one space to the other via this communication, or alternatively penetrate the mylohyoid which is a poor barrier to the spread of infection. Because the attachment of mylohyoid (the mylohoid line) becomes more superior towards the posterior of the mandible, posterior infected teeth are more likely to drain into the submandibular space, and infected anterior teeth are more likely to drain into the sublingual space, since the apices of the teeth are more likely to be below and above the mylohoid line respectively (see diagram).

It inserts on the body of the hyoid . Structure It arises from the posterior and lateral surface of the styloid process of the temporal bone, near the base; and, passing inferior and anterior, it is inserted into the body of the hyoid bone, at its junction with the greater cornu, and just superior to the omohyoid muscle. It thus belongs to the group of suprahyoid muscles. When contracted, it elevates the hyoid, this action is primarily brought about during swallowing. It is perforated, near its insertion, by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle. =Nerve supply= A branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) innervates the stylohyoid muscle. =Variation= It may be absent or doubled, lie beneath the carotid artery, or be inserted into the omohyoid, or mylohyoid muscles. Function The stylohyoid muscle elevates and retracts hyoid bone. It initiates a swallowing action by pulling the hyoid bone in a posterior and superior direction.

She was the first Navy ship named for Samuel Nicholas (1744‚Äì1790), the first Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. History Nicholas was laid down 11 January 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched 1 May 1919; sponsored by Miss Edith Barry; and commissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard 23 November 1920, Lieutenant Commander Herndon B. Kelly in command. Assigned to Reserve Destroyer Divisions, Pacific Fleet, Nicholas departed Mare Island on 17 December 1920 for San Diego, California, arriving on the 20th and remaining principally in that area with a reduced complement through 1922. The destroyer sailed on 6 February 1923 as part of Destroyer Squadron 11 for combined fleet operations in the Panama Canal Zone. Arriving Balboa twenty days later following exercises en route, the warship engaged in tactical and strategic maneuvers through the end of March and returned to San Diego on 11 April. From 25 June to 31 August, Nicholas and DesRon 11 cruised the coast of Washington, putting in at Tacoma, Port Angeles, and Seattle and serving as escort to President Warren G. Harding in Henderson on his arrival at Seattle on 27 July. She then participated in squadron maneuvers through the end of August with Battleship Division 3, putting in at San Francisco on the 31st. Nicholas sailed for her homeport at 08:30, 8 September, in company with most of DesRon 11 under Captain Edward H. Watson, with Delphy leading the way. Engaged in a high-speed engineering run down the Pacific Coast, the squadron changed course at 21:00 as inaccurate navigation indicated this was the approach to Santa Barbara Channel. At 21:05, Delphy stranded on the rocks of Point Pedernales, known to sailors as Honda, or the Devil‚Äôs Jaw; though warning signals were sent up by the flagship, the sheltering configuration of the coast line prevented their recognition by the remaining ships of DesRon 11 and in the ensuing confusion, six other destroyers ‚Äî including Nicholas ‚Äî ran aground also. Nicholas‚Äô skipper, Lt. Cmdr. Herbert Roesch, did his utmost to prevent the loss of the destroyer as the heavy seas broke over her and Honda‚Äôs rocks pushed into her hull, but the ship was taken by currents and drifted slowly astern, coming to a stop stern-high on a clump of rocks with a 25¬∞ list to starboard. USS Nicholas aground at Honda Point. Throughout the night, the crew attempted to save Nicholas but in the morning as the waves mounted and Nicholas‚Äô situation became critical, the Captain ordered ‚ÄúAbandon Ship‚Äù. The order was accomplished and brought the entire crew ashore safely. Of the seven destroyers' crews, only 23 lives were lost. Considered out of commission on 26 October 1923, Nicholas was struck from the Navy List with her six squadron mates on 20 November. After a number of abortive bids, the destroyer was finally sold on 19 October 1925 to Robert J. Smith of Oakland, California. Though some equipment was salvaged from the wrecked ship, her hull was left to the mercy of the sea in the ‚Äúgraveyard of the Pacific.‚Äù The event came to be known as the Honda Point Disaster.

Surfacewise this is the smallest administrative unit in the Maldives, situated in the Equatorial Channel (Addu - Mulah Kandu) between Huvadhu Atoll and Addu Atoll. Geography The atoll of Fuvahmulah corresponding to this administrative division is the 25th natural atoll of the Maldives. Some people due to lack of knowledge or as part of a prevailing misconception erroneously mention that Fuvahmulah is not an atoll. An island of coral that encircles a lagoon partially or completely is what we call an atoll. In the distant past Fuvahmulah was a small coral atoll whose southern end was open at a spot called Diyarehifaando and the inside of the island was a saltwater lagoon forming a natural harbour. There is a spot in the southern end known as a Kudhuheraivali (the forest of the small islet), which indicates that there was a separate little island in that area in ancient times. But long ago the channel connecting the lagoon with the ocean was closed by massive coral boulders. Thus the inside of the island is lower than its edges. In time the inner lagoon lost its saltiness and all that remains today are two small lakes(Kulhi), wetlands and marshy taro fields. Therefore, Fuvahmulah is a small Atoll that closed and filled in with silt, like Nukutavake in the Central Pacific. Municipal Divisions Fuvahmulah was traditionally divided into nine wards. From North to South these wards were: (1) Dhadimago, (2) DiguvƒÅndo (both stretching from East to West shore), (3) H≈çdhado, (5) Dhashokubaa (both segmental) separated by, (4) MƒÅdhado (A diagonal strip of parallel width); whilst the other four divisions, which occupied the Southern part of the island consisted of two Eastern and Western strips, bisected into four wards, (6) MƒÅlegan and (8) D≈´ndigan lying to East, (7) Miskimmago and (9) FunƒÅdo to West. The largest division among all is Dhadimago. With time, some changes saw its way into existence. Nowadays, the number of wards has been reduced to eight, since the village of Dhashokubaa was merged with Miskimmago. Moreover, extension of some wards with time, brought its way into certain changes in area such as that of H≈çdhado. The northerly extension of the ward by time led to the land from Eastern strip of DiguvƒÅndo and some parts of that of Dhadimago being claimed to the village. It was mainly the land consisting of agricultural fields and plantations to vegetation owned by the villagers of Dhadimago and DiguvƒÅndo. Administratively these divisions act as the replacement for islands in other atolls. For each ward a chief ('Katheeb') was appointed as in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the respective ward and held accountable for an Island chief. With the introduction of local government policy in the Maldives, an Island Council is to be elected for each ward of the island according to the Decentralisation act 2010. Also, an Atoll Council is to be elected for the atoll as a whole. NOTE: Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc.. (including Gnaviyani) are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions or contain half of an atoll (In case of Thiladhunmathi to Haa Alif, Haa Dhaal, Shaviyani and Noonu Atolls, Huvadhu Atoll to Gaafu Alifu and Gaafu Dhaalu Atolls and In case of half of Ari Atoll to Alifu Dhaalu Atoll), while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls (In case of Raa, Baa, Kaafu, Alifu Alifu and Vaavu Atolls). Some administrative divisions correspond to the same natural atoll too (In case of Lhaviyani, Meemu, Faafu, Dhaalu, Thaa, Laamu, Gnaviyani and Seenu Atolls). The order followed by the code letters are from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters may not be accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll). Aware of the extent of this problem, Maldivian expert Mr. Ibrahim Luthfee wrote a book on Maldivian geography before he died. With this book, which is unfortunately available only in Dhivehi, the late Mr. Luthfee tried to clear a number of misconceptions that carelessly researched tourist publications have generalized even among Maldivians. Much of this article has been translated and adapted from his posthumous work. References * Divehi TƒÅrƒ´khah Au Alikameh. Divehi BahƒÅi TƒÅrikhah KhidmaiykurƒÅ Qaumƒ´ Markazu. Reprint 1958 edn.

A common chimpanzee who wears a deerstalker hat (√† la Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional sleuth Sherlock Holmes), Detective Chimp has human-level intelligence and solves crimes, often with the help of the Bureau of Amplified Animals, a group of intelligent animals that also includes Rex the Wonder Dog. He was originally created in the final years of the Golden Age of Comic Books, during the interregnum between the former and the Silver Age of Comic Books. After his initial appearance in Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog he continued to appear in that title as a backup feature until 1959, at which point he faded into obscurity. Several decades after his last appearance, Detective Chimp appeared in several cameos, namely in a 1981 story, \\"Whatever Happened to Rex the Wonder Dog?\\" (DC Comics Presents #35) and later in a brief cameo with Sam Simeon in Gorilla City during 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths. Following these appearances, Bobo started appearing in DC titles with some regularity, appearing in issues of Green Lantern, The Flash, and other titles. This eventually led to prominent roles in the 2005 Day of Vengeance miniseries and subsequently as a regular in its spin-off series Shadowpact. The character has gone on to guest-star in other DC Comics titles. Fictional character biography When first introduced, Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a \\"helping mascot\\" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe. He could not speak, but could understand humans and make himself understood. Bobo, a smoker, is a member of Mensa, and had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives as the Croatoan Society. One of the other former members of the Society was the detective/superhero Ralph Dibny. The Chimp's origin has been revamped and elaborated on several times since his initial Silver Age appearances. 1989's Secret Origins (vol. 2) #40 credited the experimentation of a microscopic alien race with Bobo's intelligence. This origin has since been retconned, notably in the Day of Vengeance six-part limited series. In the latter it was shown that Bobo was captured in Equatorial Africa in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: \\"Bobo the Detective Chimp\\". For the act, Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could \\"discover the deepest secrets of the public\\". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe because Thorpe took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until a trip to Florida, at which time Rex the Wonder Dog, took him to the Fountain of Youth, where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language, as well as eternal youth. Rex's and Bobo's journey to the Fountain of Youth was originally depicted in the aforementioned DC Comics Presents #35, July 1981. The intelligence Bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act, and in at least one instance, he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister, and shared his insights with the local police. At some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or even if the Bureau still exists.Green Lantern vol. 3 #30 After the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the Martian Manhunter, during the JLApe crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.Martian Manhunter Annual #2 However, as an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he could not enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an alcoholic, never leaving the other-dimensional Oblivion Bar (which changed management twice during his time there), until the establishment was acquired by Jim Rook. \\"Bobo\\" is not his real name, which he declines to share.Day of Vengeance #4. DC Comics. It is revealed by the Phantom Stranger to be \\"mostly an unpronounceable screech and three grunts\\", which translates as \\"Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs\\".Shadowpact #7. DC Comics. =Shadowpact= thumb When the Spectre attempts to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp, while still mostly drunk, coerces a group of mystical characters gathered from the Oblivion Bar into battling the Spectre. This leads to the formation of the group the Shadowpact. Although lacking superhuman powers, Detective Chimp exhibits not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the Phantom Stranger (at the time transformed into a mouse), he devises a plan to use the powers of Black Alice and Nightshade to confront the combined menace of Eclipso and the Spectre. Bobo also helps clean up the demonic damage left from the Rock of Eternity's explosion over Gotham City. He captures the sin of \\"Sloth\\", which had possessed his long-time friend Rex the Wonder Dog. After the Rock is reformed, the sins re-imprisoned, and all magical influence cleaned out of Gotham, the dying Doctor Fate gives Detective Chimp the powerful Helmet of Fate. After finding it does not fit him, Detective Chimp convinces Captain Marvel to throw it to Earth, to let fate choose its next bearer.Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1. DC Comics. When the helmet of Doctor Fate returns to Earth, Detective Chimp for a brief time bonds with it, granting him additional powers that he uses to assist the Gotham City police in apprehending the villain Trickster. After struggling against the temptation of the helmet, Bobo sends it on to another journey.Helmet of Fate: Detective Chimp #1. DC Comics. Recently, it has been shown that Bobo occasionally assists Batman in his cases by way of a chat room where they swap theories. The Riddler is also known to chat with them, but he is unaware of the other two's identities.Detective Comics #845 =The New 52= In DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, Detective Chimp has been mentioned by Ambush Bug in the Channel 52 feature sections. He later appears as a brief cameo in aiding the Justice League United team rescue Adam Strange from the Zeta BeamJustice League United #16 DC Comicsand in the 2016 DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special story \\"The Night We Saved Christmas\\".DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special 2016. DC Comics =DC Rebirth= In DC Rebirth, Detective Chimp, a.k.a. Bobo, has appeared in the Dark Nights: Metal event, is one of the survivors of the invasion of the Dark Nights (alternate versions of Batman from a Dark Multiverse) and is seen at the Oblivion Bar alongside the Justice League, Kendra Saunders, Doctor Fate and others. Bobo's close friend Nightmaster, the owner of the Oblivion Bar, is killed in this confrontation.Dark Nights: Metal #3 (October 2017) Bobo later takes over the bar and Nightmaster's mystical duties.Justice League Dark #1 (2018) Powers and abilities Detective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and physical strength that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of Ralph Dibny and Batman. Bobo has an Intelligence Quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population, as evidenced by his Mensa membership. For a brief time, Detective Chimp also had additional sense-expanding powers granted him by the helmet of Doctor Fate. Because a chimpanzee's muscles are much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp is unable to swim. Recent scientific evidence suggests that chimpanzees can swim, and this represents a continuity error (or Detective Chimp simply never learned to swim). Other versions=Tangent: Superman's Reign= In Tangent: Superman's Reign, the Earth-9 version of Detective Chimp is revealed to be the screen name of a human hacker named Guy Gardner. =DC One Million and Dark Nights: Metal= In DC One Million, the far future version of Detective Chimp is one of the heroes of the Gorilla Galaxy, and wears a costume similar to Batman's.

John Constantine tracks down 'the world's greatest detective' - normally the moniker applied to Batman - to assist in defeating a fascistic Superman. At first, Chimp drunkenly curses Constantine, but then agrees to join him as he and Batman appear in the back of Chas Chandler's cab, where he and John mock the brooding detectives. Constantine then leads him and Batman to a church where he has magically sealed Raven, much to Chimp's surprise. Chimp then asks John why he is involved in this war between Batman and Superman, but Constantine explains how the conflict with the Green Lantern Corps killed his daughter Rose's mother and he wants revenge on Superman. Batman then gathers his allies, including Chimp, at Jason Blood's home, where Batman and Constantine try to explain their plan. Detective Harvey Bullock, though, announces that he plans on leaving, feeling that he is out of his element in this world of superheroes, but Chimp stops him and reveals that he knows his reputation as a detective and his work with Commissioner Gordon in the past on several cases. Chimp then admits he feels outside his own comfort zone but he is still here for the same reason that Gordon is and asks him to stay. Before Bullock can answer, Klarion the Witch Boy's cat, Teekl, senses something coming as Jason realizes his home's protective seal was broken when Bullock opened the door. Before Bullock can close the door, the Spectre vaporizes both Bullock and Blood, with Chimp getting caught in the blast. Alfred Pennyworth, though, manages to save Chimp as he, Zatanna, and Harley Quinn, manage to keep him alive, where Alfred carries his body while Zatanna teleports the others to the Tower of Fate. Chimp then awakens and grasps Harley's hand as she, Alfred, and Zatanna try to keep him alive, where it is revealed that Chimp is missing an eye. Doctor Fate then appears to take Constantine's daughter, Rose, away. Harley, though, demands Fate to help him save Chimp, but Fate says he cannot help him. Harley Quinn and Klarion the Witch Boy save Chimp's life, but Chimp loses the use of one eye and has to wear an eye patch. When Sinestro later kills Klarion, Chimp tells the assembled group that, without Klarion, he will cease to exist and fades away in front of Harley and the other rebels.

He is currently employed as the president-in-residence at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, following his retirement from the position of president of Macalester College. In addition to these positions, he served on the board of trustees of the Dickens Society from 2000 to 2004. In 2014, the Teagle Foundation announced his appointment to their Board of Directors. A native of New York City, Rosenberg received his B.A. degree from Cornell University and his M.A. and Ph.D. in English from Columbia University. He has published numerous articles on Dickens and other subjects as well as two books: Mary Lee Settle's Beulah Quintet: The Price of Freedom (1991) and Little Dorrit's Shadows: Character and Contradiction in Dickens (1996). Rosenberg began his academic career as an adjunct assistant professor of humanities at the Cooper Union in New York City in 1982. He worked at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, from 1983 to 1998 as an English professor and as chair of the English Department and participated in the development of the college's strategic plan. From 1998 to 2003, Rosenberg was dean of the faculty and an English professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. While in this position, he was responsible for all academic programs, athletics, the library, instructional technology and the Lawrence University art gallery. He directed the design and passage of the university's first new general education requirements in 15 years, created the college's first mentoring program for new faculty and wrote the long-range faculty staffing plan. Rosenberg became the 16th president of Macalester College in August 2003. During his 17-year tenure, Rosenberg faced some criticism from the student body and alumni for his salary, which ranked within the top ten highest in America for a college president. He led a number of fundraising campaigns for the college, such as the Macalester Moment campaign, and oversaw the construction and renovation of several buildings on campus, including the Leonard Center Athletics and Wellness Complex, Markim Hall, and the Janet Wallace Fine Arts Center. He remained politically outspoken during this time, writing articles on the politics involved in higher education and responding freely to current events in newsletters and statements to the student body. In 2019, Rosenberg announced that he planned to retire from the position of President at the end of the academic year in 2020; he was succeeded in the position by Dr. Suzanne Rivera. In fall of 2020, he will begin working as president-in-residence at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Rosenberg has been cited as physically attractive by many sources. He was chosen as People's Sexiest College President in 2010 and again in 2014.

They are often model figures portraying humans or other living creatures. In Japan, kits often depict anime characters, and in the United States depictions of movie monsters are common. However, kits are produced depicting a wide range of subjects, from characters from horror, science fiction, fantasy films, television and comic books to nudes and pin-up girls to dinosaurs to original works of art, as well as upgrade and conversion kits for existing models and airsoft guns. Originally garage kits were amateur-produced, and the term originated with dedicated hobbyists using their garages as workshops. Unable to find model kits of subjects they wanted on the market, they began producing kits of their own. As the market expanded professional companies began making similar kits. Sometimes a distinction is made between true garage kits, made by amateurs, and resin kits, manufactured professionally by companies. Because of the labor-intensive casting process, garage kits are usually produced in limited numbers and are more expensive than injection-molded plastic kits. The parts are glued together using cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) or an epoxy cement and the completed figure is painted. Some figures are sold completed, but most commonly they are sold in parts for the buyer to assemble and finish. Japan Japanese garage kits are often female anime figures, sometimes in lurid or even pornographic poses. Another major subject is \\"Kaiju\\" monsters such as Godzilla, and they also include subjects like mecha and science fiction space ships. Garage kits can be as simple as a one piece figure, or as complex as kits with well over one hundred parts. Most commonly they are cast in polyurethane resin, but may also be fabricated of such diverse substances as soft vinyl, white metal (a type of lead alloy) and fabric. Originally the kits were sold and traded between hobbyists at conventions like Wonder Festival. As the market grew a number of companies began producing resin kits professionally, such as Federation Models, Volks, WAVE/Be-J, Kaiyodo, Kotobukiya and B-Club, a subsidiary of Bandai producing Gundam kits (Gunpla). The scale of figure kits varies, but as of 2008 1/8 seems to be predominant. Prior to 1990 the dominant scale was 1/6. This scale shrink coincided with the rise in material, labor, and licensing costs. Other scales, such as 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/7 also exist, but are less common. Larger kits (1/3, 1/4, etc.) generally command higher prices due to the greater amounts of material required to produce them. Japanese garage kits are usually cast as separate parts which are packed with instructions and sometimes photographs of the final product. Most professionally manufactured kits come in a box while amateur-produced kits sold at conventions come in plastic bags, blank boxes or even boxes with copied sheet information glued onto them. They are not painted, but some of them do have decals provided by the sculptor or circle. The builder has to paint and assemble the model, preferably with an airbrush. However, they can also be painted with a regular brush using a variety of techniques to achieve similar effects as when painting with a conventional airbrush. USA In the 1950s and 60s Aurora and other companies produced cheap plastic models of movie monsters, comic book heroes, and movie and television characters. This market disappeared, but through the 1980s an underground market grew through which enthusiasts could acquire the old plastic model kits.WonderFest - Garage Kit history - from a personal viewpoint... In the early to mid-1980s, hobbyists began creating their own garage kits of movie monsters. There was a small but enthusiastic market for these new model kits. They were poured into flexible molds which could produce rigid reproductions of new figures which were sculpted more accurately and with more detail than the old plastic model kits. They were usually produced in limited numbers and sold primarily by mail order and at toy and hobby conventions. In the mid- to late 1980s the monster model kit hobby grew toward the mainstream. By the 1990s model kits were produced in the US and the UK, as well as in Japan, and distributed through hobby and comic stores. There was an unprecedented variety of licensed model figure kits. In the late 1990s model kit sales went down. Hobby and comic stores and their distributors began carrying fewer garage kits or closed down and producers shut their doors. As of 2009, there are two American garage kit magazines, Kitbuilders Magazine and Amazing Figure Modeler,amazingmodeler.com and there are garage kit conventions held each year, like WonderFest USA in Louisville, Kentucky.wonderfest.com Production Garage kits are generally produced in small quantities, from the tens to a few hundred copies, compared to injection-molded plastic kits which are produced in many thousands. This is due to the labor-intensive nature of the manufacturing process and the relatively low market demand. Resin casting garage kit production is the most labor-intensive. The upside is that creating the initial mold is much less costly than in the injection- molding process. Vinyl garage kits are produced by using liquid vinyl Plastisol in a spin casting process known as slush molding. It is more complex than resin casting, but less expensive and less sophisticated than the injection molding used for most plastic products. It is not something that is commonly done in a basement or garage. Intellectual property issues The legality of amateur garage kits can be questionable as they are not always properly licensed. The model might be of a copyrighted character or design that was produced by fans because no official model exists. The relatively low initial investment and ease of resin casting means that it's also easy to create recast copies of existing original kits. Recasts are produced by making molds of parts from original model kits and then doing recasts from the new molds. This can be done for personal use, such as modification of an existing kit, but unlicensed recast copies are sometimes sold unlawfully. In some cases the original kit is no longer available, but in others they are still in active production. The recasts can be of officially licensed model kits, but when they are of unlicensed kits the sculptor usually has a hard time pursuing litigation. The recasts are usually of inferior quality when produced in Thailand, however, other recasters in Hong Kong rival originals in quality and casting and offer at a price that undercuts the original. Recast kits can be found on online auction sites, where they can be difficult to control due to cumbersome site policies and seller pseudonymity. Many recasters are in East Asia but can be found all over the globe.WonderFest - What are recasts? In an effort to legitimize amateur garage kit production and sales in Japan, it is not uncommon for license holder to issue 'single day license' (:ja:ÂΩìÊó•ÁâàÊ®©„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†) where for one day only, license is granted for sale of amateur garage kits. These licensing agreement are typically negotiated between an event organizer (Wonder Festival, Character Hobby, Figure Mania, etc.) and varies licensing entities for license to characters from specific TV shows and movies. Typically the event organizer publishes in advance, a list of licenses available, and sculptors intending to sell their sculptures then submit applications (including photos of sculpture) for approval. It is not uncommon for applications to be rejected.

C. Fields, directed by A. Edward Sutherland and released by Paramount Pictures. The tagline of the film was \\"The Grand Hotel of comedy\\". It is a mixture of comedy and musical acts tied together by a slim plot line, in the style of the Big Broadcast pictures that were also released by Paramount during the 1930s. In addition to some typical comedic lunacy from W. C. Fields and Burns and Allen, it provides a snapshot of some popular stage and radio acts of the era. The film includes some risqu√© pre-Code humor. Plot At International House, a large hotel in metropolitan Wuhu, China Chinese inventor Dr. Wong (Edmund Breese) is soliciting bids for the rights to his \\"radioscope\\", a kind of television. Unlike real television, his contraption does not need a camera; it can look in on events anywhere in the world as if it were a ground-penetrating electronic telescope, complete with audio. Prof. Henry R. Quail (W. C. Fields) is one of many people from around the world converging on the hotel, though he is one of the few not hoping to buy (or steal) Dr. Wong's invention, as he was intending to land in Kansas City in his autogyro but flew off course. Also converging on the hotel are four-times-divorced American celebrity Peggy Hopkins Joyce (playing herself) avoiding one of her ex-husbands, violently jealous Russian General Petronovich (Bela Lugosi); Tommy (Stuart Erwin), the representative of an American electric company, hoping to buy Wong's invention and finally wed his sweetheart Carol (Sari Maritza); resident physician Dr. Burns (George Burns) and his goofy aide Nurse Allen (Gracie Allen) dealing with a quarantine on the hotel; and the exasperation of the hotel's fussy and frustrated manager (Franklin Pangborn). Dr. Wong is particularly eager to look in on a six-day indoor bicycle race in New York, but instead somehow brings in performances by popular crooner Rudy Vall√©e, bandleader-vocalist Cab Calloway, and precocious torch singer Baby Rose Marie, and comedians Stoopnagle and Budd. A floor show (featuring Sterling Holloway and Lona Andre) is also performed in the hotel's rooftop garden restaurant. Ultimately, Tommy wins both the rights to the radioscope and his sweetheart, and Peggy Hopkins Joyce, having learned that Prof. Quail is a millionaire, quickly attaches herself to her next sugar daddy. Prof. Quail and his new companion are chased as he drives his little American Austin automobile through several public areas of the hotel and down several flights of a fire escape before driving it back into the hold of his autogyro and taking off.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

Top-billed Peggy Hopkins Joyce was famous as an unabashed real-life gold-digger, not as an actress. Her many affairs with and several marriages to wealthy older men earned her millions, and in the film she makes several humorous references to her profitable divorces, a topic that would become almost completely off-limits with enforcement of the Code. Several of the \\"cellophane\\" costumes in the \\"She Was a China Tea-cup\\" production number allow the bare outlines of breasts to be seen, a degree of nudity that the Code would not permit. The setting of Wuhu, China also serves as a play on \\"Woo-hoo!\\", an exclamation which at that time was sometimes used to comment that something was sexually naughty. Hearing the city's name, W. C. Fields, as Professor Quail, responds to what he mistakes as homosexual flirting with \\"Don't let the posy fool you\\", referring to his own boutonniere, which he plucks out and tosses away. Walking down a hotel corridor, Fields pauses to peep through a keyhole, then comments, \\"What won't they think of next!\\" Such implications of what the Code called \\"sex perversion\\" (usually defined then as anything other than procreative sex in the missionary position) would soon be strictly prohibited. This was one of several films in which Fields tweaked censors' noses with one particular deniable double entendre. Sitting next to him in a small car, Joyce (whom he has punningly called \\"my little Laplander\\") squirms uncomfortably and tells him she is sitting on something. After saying \\"I lost mine in the stock market\\" Fields checks, finds a cat under her, and exclaims, \\"Ah, it's a pussy!\\" Performing with his hot dance band, Cab Calloway sings \\"Reefer Man\\", which describes the odd behavior and ravings of the titular heavy marijuana smoker (portrayed by bass player Al Morgan, who performs as if in a trance). In one gag, W. C. Fields enters a scene contentedly smoking an opium pipe (but with a cigar in place of the opium) and commenting, \\"They stupefy! They're roasted!\\", a play on two then-current cigarette advertising slogans. References to recreational drug use were among the many Legion of Decency thou-shalt-nots that would soon be rigidly enforced. In the sequence with the Austin - the smallest car sold in America at that time - W. C. Fields remarks that it \\"used to belong to the Postmaster General.\\" This was a potshot at Will Hays, the diminutive former Postmaster General who was then trying to enforce an essentially voluntary and often disregarded early Production Code. =Earthquake= On March 10, 1933, an earthquake occurred during production, and a Paramount newsreel featured what was presented as footage of cast members on the set reacting as it struck. A documentary featurette on W. C. Fields accompanying the film's DVD release, however, reveals that Fields and director Sutherland faked the footage for the publicity. The actual earthquake, centered off nearby Long Beach, caused widespread major damage to unreinforced masonry and about 120 consequent fatalities. A 1976 episode of the television series \\"In Search Of...\\" that dealt with earthquakes showed the footage. Music Lyricist Leo Robin and composer Ralph Rainger wrote three songs for the film: \\"She Was a China Tea-cup and He Was Just a Mug\\", performed offscreen by an unidentified male vocalist; \\"Thank Heaven For You\\", sung onscreen by Rudy Vallee; and \\"My Bluebird's Singing the Blues\\", sung onscreen by Baby Rose Marie. A fourth Robin-Rainger song, \\"Look What I've Got\\", originally featured in the slightly earlier film A Bedtime Story, is heard as an instrumental, supposedly played by \\"Ah Phooey and His Manly Mandarins\\" in a broadcast from a radio station that calls itself \\"The Voice of Long Tung\\"; it provides the musical accompaniment for an otherwise silent he-and-she undressing scene. Cab Calloway and His Harlem Maniacs perform 1932's \\"Reefer Man\\", written by Andy Razaf (lyrics) and J. Russell Robinson (music).

He is perhaps best known for his role as Christian Shephard in the TV series Lost and Larry McCoy in the TV series Las Vegas. He is also the father of football player Hanna Terry of KIF √ñrebro DFF in the Swedish women's football league Damallsvenskan. Early life Terry was born in Vero Beach, Florida, where he attended Vero Beach High School. He was also educated at the prestigious Loomis Chaffee prep school in Windsor, Connecticut, and began a career building original custom log homes in North Carolina. He played roles in local theater before moving to Alaska where he founded a river rafting company. But his interest in acting did not diminish. At age 30 he moved to New York City and became a full-time actor. Career Terry's debut role was as the title character in the 1980 fantasy film Hawk the Slayer, followed by roles in films such as There Goes the Bride (1980), Tuxedo Warrior (1982) and the action sequel Wild Geese II (1985), as Barbara Carrera's brother. His career then took a major upswing as he was assigned the roles of Lieutenant Lockhart in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Felix Leiter in the James Bond film The Living Daylights (1987). Nothing as prominent followed immediately, though he received good notices for his role as a traumatized Vietnam veteran in Norman Jewison's In Country (1989). Terry subsequently played the lead in a well-regarded but short-lived TV series Against the Grain. Terry played Slim in the 1992 film adaptation of Of Mice and Men and also appeared in The Resurrected (1992), an adaption of the H. P. Lovecraft novella, Case of Charles Dexter Ward. He found new success on television. He appeared in the first episodes of ER playing Dr. Div Cvetic, the love interest of Dr. Lewis, who disappeared after a nervous breakdown. He later played a recurring role in season two of Fox's real-time thriller 24, as Bob Warner, the father of both the love interest of hero Jack Bauer and of another daughter whose fianc√© is suspected of being a terrorist. After a brief stint on NBC's Las Vegas, he was cast as Christian Shephard, the father of Jack Shephard and Claire Littleton on ABC's Lost. Terry reprised his role as Shephard on several occasions in flashbacks before appearing frequently in real time on the island as an incarnation of \\"the man in black\\". He had a guest role in a 2006 episode of Law & Order, as well as the part of older Jacob Wheeler in Steven Spielberg's Into the West mini series, which was nominated for 16 Emmy Awards in 2006.

It comprises five major traditions, Vaishnavism, Brahmanism, Saurism, Shaktism, Shaivism, whose followers consider Vishnu, Brahma, Surya, Shakti (Devi) and Shiva to be the Supreme deity respectively. Most of the other deities were either related to them or different forms (incarnations) of these deities. Hinduism has been called the \\"oldest religion\\" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as \\"the eternal law\\". ('). Given below is a list of the chief Hindu deities followed by a list of Hindu deities (including demi-gods). Smartism, an older tradition and later reestablished by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, invites the worship of more than one god including Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti and Ganesha (the elephant faced god) among other gods and goddesses. It is not as overtly sectarian as either Vashnavism, Brahmanism or Saivism and is based on the recognition that Brahman (God) is the highest principle in the universe and pervades all of existence. Main deities The Hindu trinity consists of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. Their feminine counterparts are Saraswati, the wife of Brahma, Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, and Parvati the wife of Shiva. The followers of the last two form two major sects. =Brahma= According to Hinduism, Brahma is the creator of the entire cosmic universe. Although he is the creator, he is hardly worshipped in modern Hinduism. He is identified with supreme vedic god, Prajapati. He married Saraswati, who emerged to give knowledge to create. Some alternative names for Brahma are: * Vednatha * Chaturmukha * Prajapati * Hiranyagarbha * Vedagarbha =Devi (goddess)= Communities of goddess worship are ancient in India. In the Rigveda, the most prominent goddess is Ushas, the goddess of dawn. In modern Hinduism, goddesses are widely revered. Shaktism is one of the major sects of Hinduism. Followers of Shaktism believe that the goddess (Devi) is the power (Shakti) that underlies the female principle, and that Devi is the supreme being, one and the same with Para Brahman. Shakti has many forms/manifestations like Parvati, Durga, and others but there are also goddesses that are parts of Shakti such as Lakshmi and Saraswati. Devi is believed to manifest in peaceful forms, such as Parvati the consort of Shiva and also in fierce forms, such as Kali and Durga. In Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is regarded as Ultimate Godhead or Para Brahman. She is formless i.e. Nirguna in reality, but may take many forms i.e. Saguna. Durga and Lalita Tripurasundari are regarded as the Supreme goddess in the Kalikula and Srikula systems respectively. Shaktism is closely related with Tantric Hinduism, which teaches rituals and practices for purification of the mind and body. Some different parts of Shakti (Devi) the Mother Goddess: * Parvati and her Navadurgas, Matrikas, and Mahavidyas * Kali (form of Parvati) as Bhadrakali, an auspicious form of Kali and Bharavi/Chamundeshwari often known as Chandi, as a ferocious form of Parvati * Bhumi, the mother Earth known as Prithvi * Lakshmi and her Ashtalakshmi, goddess of wealth and wife of lord vishnu * Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and music and also first wife of lord Brahma * Gayatri, the supreme life giving goddess and second wife of lord Brahma * Ganga, the goddess personification of the Ganges River, she later married King Shantanu as his first wife and gave birth to Bhishma Pitamah in the Mahabharat era. * Narmada, the daughter of Shiva, also goddess of river Narmada * Annapoorna (incarnation of Goddess Parvati), the goddess of food * Nidra, goddess of sleep * Yami, the sacred river Yamuna and goddess of life * Santoshi Mata, considered to be the goddess of happiness and long life * Sati(first wife of lord Shiva), the adi parasakti early life of Parvati. * Shashthi, also known as Devasena, daughter of Brahma and Savitri, wife of Kartikeya and goddess of children and reproduction. * Savitri, wife of Brahma,born from the left side of Brahma, mother of four Vedas. * Manasa, daughter of sage Kashyap, sister of Vasuki, wife of sage Jaratkaru, mother of sage Astika and goddess of snakes and fertility. * Svaha, considered as the goddess of ash and marriage, daughter of Daksha and wife of Agni. * Dakshina, goddess of yagna, born from the hair follicles of Radha, reborn from goddess Lakshmi and wife of lord Yagna. =Shiva= Shaivism is one of the major Hindu sects. Adherents of Shaivism believe that the god Shiva is the supreme being. Shiva is the destroyer god among the Trimurti, and so is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Shaivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals. Some alternative forms of Shiva (and Bhairavs) are listed below: * Ardhanarishvara * Nataraja * Pashupati * Rudra * Dakshinamurthy * Ravananugraha * Vaidheeswara * Lingodbhava * Bhikshatana * Sri Manjunatha * Vaidhyanatha * Mahakaleshwara * Tryambak * Bholenath =Vishnu= Vaishnavism is the sect within Hinduism that worships Vishnu, the preserver god of the Hindu Trimurti (the Trinity), and his many incarnations. Vishnuism regard him to be supreme, strongest and eternal. It is a devotional sect, and followers worship many deities, including Rama and Krishna both the 7th & the 8th incarnations of Vishnu respectively. The adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic, monastic and devoted to meditative practice and ecstatic chanting. Some alternate names of Vishnu the Preserver: * Adi Narayana * Narayana * Thirumal * Perumal * Jagannatha * Hayagriva * Achyuta * Madhava * Venkateshwara, as Vishnu is known in parts of South India * Guruvayurappan * Vaikuntha Chaturmurti * Vaikuntha Kamalaja * Mohini * Lakshmi Narayan * Vishvarupa * Ranganatha * Dashavatara, the 10 incarnations of Vishnu * Madhusudana * Padmanabha * Ananta Shayana * Hari * Upulvan, another name for Vishnu In Sri Lanka * Purushottama * Vasudeva * Govinda * Caturvy≈´ha Related deities * Yamuna, the life energy, the daughter of lord Surya and the goddess of kindness, humanity, beauty. * Ganesha, son of Shiva and Parvati and was also called Ganpati, the Ganapatya sectary worshipped Ganesha as their chief deity.

He's also the brother of Lord Ganesha. * Ayyappan, son of Shiva and Mohini and was also called Manikanta since he has mani(Rudraksha) in kanta(neck) * Hanuman, is one of incarnation of Shiva and devotee of Rama (incarnation of Vishnu) and was also called Anjaneya, since his mother is anjana * Ganga, holi river in Hinduism. * Hansa, the devoted swan who acts as the vahana (vehicle) of Lord Brahma. * Garuda, the devoted eagle who acts as the vahana (vehicle) of Lord Vishnu and the king of all birds. * Nandi, the devoted bull who acts as the vahana (vehicle) of Lord Shiva. * Shani, the son of Sun * Shesha, the king of Nagas Avatars (incarnations)=Shakti= Adi Parashakti Adi parashakti # Gayatri # Mahamaya # Yogamaya # Sati # Lalitha parameswari # Parvathy # Aparna # Durga # Rudrani # Mhalsa # Narayani # Kamakhya # Meenakshi # Kamakshi # Vishalakshi # Abhirami # Kanya Kumari # Annapoorna # Sataksi or Shakambhari # Bhramari or Bhramarambha # Kausiki # Akhilandeswari # Uma # Mari # Bhavani # Ambika # Mahadevi Dasamahavidya Mahavidya # Mahakali # Tara # Shodashi # Bhuvaneswari # Chhinnamasta # Bhairavi # Dhumavati # Bagalamukhi # Matangi # Kamalatmika Navadurga Navadurga # Shailaputri # Brahmacharini # Chandraghanta # Kushmanda # Skandamata # Katyayani # Kalaratri # Mahagauri # Siddhidhatri MahaKali Mahakali # Kali # Bhadrakali # Ugrakali # Chandi # Chamunda # Chandamari Asta Matrika Matrikas # Brahmani # Maheshwari # Kaumari # Vaishnavi # Varahi # Narasimhi # Indrani # Vinayaki \\\\---------------------------------- = Ganesha = # Vakratunda () (\\"twisting trunk\\"), his mount is a lion. # Ekadanta (\\"single tusk\\"), his mount is a mouse. # Mahodara (\\"big belly\\"), his mount is a mouse. # Gajavaktra (or GajƒÅnana) (\\"elephant face\\"), his mount is a mouse. # Lambodara (\\"pendulous belly\\"), his mount is a mouse. # Vikata () (\\"unusual form\\", \\"misshapen\\"), his mount is a peacock. # Vighnaraja () (\\"king of obstacles\\"), his mount is the celestial serpent . # Dhumravarna () (\\"grey color\\") corresponds to ≈öiva, his mount is a horse. =Shiva= # Shankar Avatar # Veerabhadra Avatar # Bhairava Avatar # Khandoba Avatar # Durvasa Avatar # Nataraja Avatar # Ardhanarishvara Avatar # Muneeswarar Avatar # Muthappan Avatar # Pashupati Avatar # Gangeshwar Avatar # Rudra Avatar # Lingam Avatar # Dakshinamurthy Avatar # Ravananugraha Avatar # Vaidheeswara Avatar # Lingodbhava Avatar # Somaskanda Avatar # Bhikshatana Avatar # Sri Manjunatha Avatar # Vaidhyanatha Avatar # Mahakaleshwara Avatar # Tryambak Avatar # Bholenath Avatar = Brahma = # Valki Avatar # Kashyapa Avatar # Sukra Avatar # Kalidasa Avatar # Chandra Avatar # Samudra Avatar # Jamvanta Avatar # Agastya Avatar = Vishnu = Dashavatara  # Matsya, the fish # Kurma, the tortoise # Varaha, the boar # Narasimha, the Half Man-Half Lion avatar. # Vamana, the Dwarf # Parashurama, the cosmic Warrior Brahmin # Rama, the king of Ayodhya and the hero of the epic Ramayana # Krishna, central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita # Buddha, the founder of Buddhism # Kalki who is expected to appear at the end of Kali Yuga = Lakshmi = #Bhargavi # Sridevi # Sita # Radha # Lalita, Bishakha, Chandrabali and all braj gopikas #Draupadi # Rukmini and Ashtabharya # Padmavati # Vedavati # Tulasi # Padmawati # Aadi Lakshmi # Aishwarya Lakshmi # Vidya Lakshmi # Dhana Lakshmi # Santana Lakshmi # Dhaanya Lakshmi # Gaja Lakshmi # Veera Lakshmi # Vijaya Lakshmi # Dhairya Lakshmi # Vidya Lakshmi # Kamala # Bhudevi # Andal # Tridevi = Saraswati = # Savitri # Vani # Brahmani # Mahasaraswati # Gayatri # Medha # Gir # VƒÅc Minor gods The Rigveda speaks of Thirty-three gods called the Trayastrinshata ('Three plus thirty'). They consists of the 12 Adityas, the 8 Vasus, the 11 Rudras and the 2 Ashvins. Indra also called ≈öakra, lord of the gods, is the first of the 33 followed by Agni. Some of these brother gods were invoked in pairs such as Indra-Agni, Mitra-Varuna and Soma-Rudra. = Adityas = * Mitra, the patron god of oaths and of friendship, * Varuna, the patron god of water and the oceans, * ≈öakra, also called Indra, the king of gods, and the god of rains * Dak·π£a, * A·πÉ≈õa, * Aryaman, * Bhaga, god of wealth * Vivasvat, also called Ravi or Savit·πõ, * TvƒÅ·π£·π≠·πõ, the smith among the gods, * P≈´san, patron god of travellers and herdsmen, god of roads, * DhƒÅt, god of health and magic, also called Dh≈´ti * Vamana = Rudras = The Ramayana tells they are eleven of the 33 children of the sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, along with the 12 Adityas, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashvins, constituting the Thirty-three gods.Mani pp. 654‚Äì5 The Vamana Purana describes the Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi. The Matsya Purana notes that Surabhi ‚Äì the mother of all cows and the \\"cow of plenty\\" ‚Äì was the consort of Brahma and their union produced the eleven Rudras. Here they are named: Nirriti, Shambhu, Aparajita Mrigavyadha, Kapardi, Dahana, Khara, Ahirabradhya, Kapali, Pingala and Senani. Brahma allotted to the Rudras the eleven positions of the heart and the five sensory organs, the five organs of action and the mind.Dani√©lou, Alain (1991). The myths and gods of India.

List in alphabetical order Most of the Hindu temples are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu (including his incarnations Krishna and Rama), Brahma, Shakti (the mother goddess, hence including the forms of Durga and Kali and the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati), Ganesh and Hanuman. The Hindu scriptures claimed that there were 33 KOTI or 33 category gods, koti meaning in Sanskrit crore (33 ‡§ï‡•ã‡§ü‡§ø = 10 prakar, tarah ). Crore also translates to 10,000,000 or 10 million. One theory is that the number 330 million (33 crore) gods refers to the total count of the then known population of all the humans and living beings that ever walked on this planet including the 84 lakh (8.4 million) jeeva rasi (living species) signifying that god exists in every living being. This is in line with the belief of Indians to respect all living beings as gods. It is estimated that the world population was around this number about a 1000 years ago when this number would have originated. It also explains the many gods (e.g. the grama devatas or village gods who were clearly living persons at one time and many of the other gods who were believed to have been persons, e.g. Rama and Krishna). Another theory is that the number might be figurative but there are several names and forms for the multitude of gods. Given below is an incomplete list of deities. =A= * Ahswhrat, Minor god of trickery and mischief * Aakash * Acyutah, another name of Vishnu. * Adimurti one of Vishnu's avatars. * Aditi is mother of the Devas. * Adityas, are the offspring of Aditi. * Agni* is the god of fire, and acceptor of sacrifices. * Anala \\"fire\\" in Sanskrit, equated among Agni. * Anila is one of the Vasus, gods of the elements of the cosmos. He is equated with the wind god VƒÅyu, Anila being understood as the name normally used for VƒÅyu when numbered among the Vasus. * Annapurna Devi Mata * Anumati (\\"divine favor\\" in Sanskrit, Devanagari: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø), also known as Chandrama, is a lunar deity and goddess of wealth, intellect, children, spirituality, and prosperity. Her vehicle is Krisha Mrigam or Krishna Jinka (Blackbuck). * Anuradha * Ap In Hinduism, it is also the name of the deva, a personification of water, one of the Vasus in most later Puranic lists. * Apam Napat is an eminent figure of the Indo-Iranian pantheon. In Hinduism, ApƒÅm NapƒÅt is the god of fresh water, such as in rivers and lakes. In Zoroastrianism, ApƒÖm NapƒÅt is also a divinity of water, see also Burz. * Aranyani is a goddess of the forests and the animals that dwell within them. Aranyani has the distinction of having one of the most descriptive hymns in the Rigveda dedicated to her, in which she is described as being elusive, fond of quiet glades in the jungle, and fearless of remote places. * Aravan also known as Iravat (‡§á‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡•ç, IrƒÅvat)[1] and Iravant, is a minor character from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata.

Latin argentum)) is the third of the Pandavas, the sons and princes of Pandu, who with Krishna, is considered to be the hero of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. * Aruna is a personification of the reddish glow of the rising Sun,[1] which is believed to have spiritual powers. The presence of Aru·πá√°, the coming of day, is invoked in Brahmin prayers to Surya. * Arundhati is the wife of the sage Vashista, one of the seven sages (Saptarshi) who are identified with the Ursa Major. She is identified with the morning star and also with the star Alcor which forms a double star with Mizar (identified as Vashista) in Ursa Major. * Aryaman is one of the early Vedic deities (devas). His name signifies \\"bosom friend\\". He is the third son of Aditi. He is an Aditya, a solar deity. He is supposed to be the chief of the manes and the Milky Way is supposed to be his path. * Ashapura -Mata no Madh is one of aspect devi. Her temples are mainly found in Gujarat. * Asura (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞,[1] Sanskrit √°su ‚Äì \\"life force\\".[2] Compare: √Üsir. Also see: Ahura Mazda) are non-suras, a different group of power-seeking deities besides the suras, sometimes considered naturalists, or nature-beings. They are the forces of chaos that are in constant battle with the Devas. * Asvayujau is a goddess of good luck, joy and happiness. * Aswiniis the first nakshatra (lunar mansion) in Hindu astrology, corresponding to the head of Aries, including the stars Œ≤ and Œ≥ Arietis. The name a≈õvinƒ´ is used by Varahamihira (6th century).

Todeswunsch saw a fundamental change in sound, abandoning the heavily synthesized darkwave music for a sound akin to the Renaissance and neo-Medieval music. A limited pressing of 3,000 CDs was initially available, and the album has been re-released at least three times. An accompanying EP, Ehjeh Ascher Ehjeh, was released later that year. Overview Todeswunch was a major departure from Sopor Aeternus' first album, ...Ich t√∂te mich..., in that the aggressive synthesized music of the first record was replaced with ornate Renaissance- and Baroque-inspired folk music. brass, woodwinds and acoustic guitars came to the fore, while drum machines were largely abandoned for varying amounts of hand percussion. Shrill female vocals also resound throughout the album, all of them provided by Anna- Varney Cantodea herself. The album quotes heavily from other works. One example is the title track, where the music is a darkwave version of Cat Stevens' \\"I Think I See the Light\\". \\"Drama der Geschlechtslosigkeit (part 2)\\" employs the melody from \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\", as featured in Mary Poppins, while \\"Shadowsphere\\" quotes the bass lines from Black Sabbath's \\"Under the Sun\\". \\"The Devil's Instrument\\" also quotes lyrics from Rozz Williams' \\"Mysterium Inquitatis\\". \\"Todeswunsch\\" contains the first instance of Cantodea's long-standing interest in Edgar Allan Poe: \\"Die Bruderschaft des Schmerzes\\" is a re-telling of his work Dream-Land.

Founded by Jamaican-born Gordon \\"Butch\\" Stewart in 1981, SRI is based in Montego Bay, Jamaica and is responsible for resort development, service standards, training and day-to-day operations. Sandals Resorts International has properties throughout the Caribbean islands of Jamaica, The Bahamas, Saint Lucia, Antigua, Turks & Caicos, and most recently Barbados, and Grenada with sixteen Sandals Resorts, three Beaches Resorts, one Grand Pineapple Beach Resort, one Fowl Cay private island resort and four villa properties in Jamaica.

The companies also announced that they will introduce Martha Stewart Crafts classes for adults at Sandals Resorts and craft camps for families at Beaches Resorts in 2010. In August 2009, SRI announced the purchase of the former Four Season Great Exuma, which debuted as Sandals Emerald Bay, Great Exuma, Bahamas on January 22, 2010. Leadership Gordon \\"Butch\\" Stewart, born in Kingston, Jamaica, on July 6, 1941, is the Chairman and Founder of Sandals Resorts International (SRI). After rising to the position of sales manager for the Dutch-owned Cura√ßao Trading Company, Stewart left in 1968 to start Appliance Traders, Ltd. (ATL), an air-conditioner service and distribution company. Gordon's son Adam Stewart is the current Deputy Chairman of SRI. Gebhard Rainer is the current CEO of Sandals Resorts International. History The first government-owned, ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù resort opened in Ocho Rios and ATL was contracted to supply kitchen appliances and air conditioners. Stewart then purchased an old hotel on one of Montego Bay‚Äôs largest beaches, despite having no hotel experience. As of 2007, he controls what analysts estimate to be a billion dollar, privately owned Jamaican-based empire that includes 25 Caribbean resorts, Appliance Traders Ltd., and The Observer newspaper. Adam Stewart is the current CEO of Sandals Resorts International (SRI), which owns and operates Caribbean-based Sandals Resorts, Beaches Resorts and Grand Pineapple Beach Resorts. Stewart oversees all areas of SRI operations, which is headquartered in Montego Bay, Jamaica. He has held this position since 2006. Stewart was born on January 27, 1981, the same year that his father, Gordon \\"Butch\\" Stewart purchased his first hotel and launched the Sandals Resorts chain. Adam Stewart was raised in Jamaica and graduated from Florida International University‚Äôs Hospitality Management Program in Miami, FL. In 1984, Sandals launched the Caribbean's first swim-up bar at its Montego Bay Resort in Jamaica. In March 2009, Stewart launched The Sandals Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Sandals Resorts International. In August 2009, Adam Stewart was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the family-owned ATL Group comprising the Jamaica Observer and a chain of appliance outlets. Sandals Corporate University (SCU) - a regional adult education program for the 10,000 employees of Sandals Resorts and Beaches Resorts - was launched in March 2012. Through partnerships with internationally-recognized universities, professional organizations, and local education institutions, SCU provides courses on skills such as customer service, leadership, the art of selling, and professional communications. Controversies=Policy on gay couples= The company had a long-standing policy dating from 1981 that banned gays from their \\"couples-only\\" resorts. The policy was variously stated by characterizing the accommodations as \\"resort for couples (heterosexual) only\\", or \\"Couples only. A couple is defined as one female adult and one male adult\\", \\"policies require male/female couples only\\", or \\"couples of the same gender are not accepted.\\" Sandals' anti-gay policy received a great deal of publicity when stays at their resorts were offered as prizes in various promotions by companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo!, and US Airways in 1999. Later reports indicated that some resorts also made no accommodations for people with disabilities, prompting the ACLU to opine that companies offering Sandals stays as prizes, or otherwise doing business with Sandals resorts, might be the targets of lawsuits. The companies involved promptly severed their relationships with Sandals, stating they were unaware of its discriminatory practices. Adverts for the company were banned from the London Underground in 2003 after public objections were raised. One possible cause for this policy may have been that homosexuality was illegal in Jamaica. Sandals ended its policy of refusing service to gay couples in August 2004 after further protest. =Corruption allegation settlement= In January 2013, the government of Turks and Caicos Islands and Sandals agreed to a settlement of US$12 million around local corruption allegations, without admission of any liability. =Television advertising= In late March 2018, student activists from the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, including David Hogg, called for a boycott of advertisers on the television show, The Ingraham Angle on Fox News Channel, after comments host Laura Ingraham made apparently disparaging David Hogg (despite a public apology by Ingraham). Dozens of advertisers on The Ingraham Angle subsequently vowed to no longer pay for advertising on The Ingraham Angle. Sandals Resorts continued to advertise on the show and represented ~25% of ads on The Ingraham Angle by the second week of June 2018. Following Ingraham's controversial comments on her June 18, 2018 show regarding facilities used to detain minor children separated from their undocumented immigrant parents, David Hogg renewed his call for boycotts of The Ingraham Angle's advertisers, including Sandals Resorts.

Although the company is best remembered as a maker of recreational powerboats, its initial products were small fiberglass runabouts. The company also supplied river patrol craft to the US Navy Patrol Boat - River between 1965 and 1972 for use in the Vietnam War. Uniflite was acquired by Chris-Craft Boats in 1984 who continued to build the boats under their brand until they ceased production in 1989. After the company's demise, Art's son, Gary Nordtvedt, went on to found Norstar Boats.  History  Uniflite (United Boat Builders) was started in Bellingham, WA, by Art \\"Papa\\" Nordtvedt, beloved Father/Grandfather/Great-Grandfather, in October 1957. The first Uniflite boat an all fiberglass 17' outboard. Uniflite soon added a 14', an 18' and a 20' outboard and inboard/outboard boats, followed by a 25' express cruiser followed by a 31' and a 34' boat. Uniflite was the only boat builder exclusively using fire-retardant resins in the production of pleasure boats. In January 1959, the plant and office moved into the old plywood plant in Fairhaven, Washington (in Bellingham). This became Uniflite's permanent home. In 1962, Uniflite became a public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange, thus becoming eligible for Navy contracts. In 1965, the Navy awarded Uniflite with a contract to build Patrol Boat, Rivers (PBRs). The PBRs were powered by twin Detroit 6V53's with water jets and they cruised between 25 and 31 knots. There were approximately 718 PBRs built, at least 418 of which were built by Uniflite. At the height of production two PBRs were rolling off the assembly line along with one 36' landing craft each day. In addition to the Navy contracts, in the 1960s and early 1970s Uniflite had numerous other military contract building 14' and 50' boats: patrol craft, landing craft, and personnel boats. Uniflite also built commercial fishing boats, and sailboats besides the more widely recognized pleasure boats. In 1977, Uniflite acquired boat molds from Pacemaker Boat Co. Pacemaker Boat company was founded in 1949 by Charles Platt (C.P.) Leek in New Jersey from his company C.P. Leek & Sons, Inc. who also later established Egg Harbor boat company. It was at this time that Uniflite started a second Uniflite plant in Swansboro, North Carolina. In 1980, a fire almost totally destroyed the Uniflite plant in Bellingham. However, since they had molds in Swansboro, NC, they were able to continue production of their boats. In 1984, Uniflite was acquired by Chris Craft for $10 per share. Chris Craft built many of the identical boats under the Chris Craft label until they stopped production in 1989.

Portrait of Ciriaco, relief carving. Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli or Cyriacus of Ancona (31 July 1391 ‚Äì 1453/55) was a restlessly itinerant Italian humanist and antiquarian who came from a prominent family of merchants in Ancona, a port on the Adriatic. He has been called the Father of Archaeology: \\"Cyriac of Ancona was the most enterprising and prolific recorder of Greek and Roman antiquities, particularly inscriptions, in the fifteenth century, and the general accuracy of his records entitles him to be called the founding father of modern classical archeology.\\"Edward W. Bodnar, Later travels, with Clive Foss  Life  Unlike many library antiquarians, Ciriaco traveled at first for his family's venturesHis first voyage was made at the age of nine, in the familia of his mother's brother. then to satisfy his own curiosity, all around the Eastern Mediterranean, noting down his archaeological discoveries in his day-book, Commentaria, that eventually filled six volumes. He made numerous voyages in Southern Italy, Dalmatia and Epirus and into the Morea, to Egypt, to Chios, Rhodes and Beirut, to Anatolia and Constantinople, during which he wrote detailed descriptions of monuments and ancient remains, illustrated by his drawings. He was employed by the Ottomans during the 1422 siege of Constantinople. His detailed on-site observations, particularly in lands of the Ottoman Empire, make him one of the precursors of modern archaeology. His accuracy as a meticulous epigrapher was praised by Giovanni Battista de Rossi.Inscriptiones Christianae Urbis Romae, VII saec. antiquiores, II, 377. His years in Rome studying Latin are commemorated by his drawings of many of the monuments and antiquities of ancient Rome. In Constantinople he studied Greek. He enjoyed the patronage of Eugenius IV, who had been Papal legate in the March of Ancona from 1420 to 1422, Cosimo de' Medici, and the Visconti of Milan. He was in Siena at the court of Sigismund, and when Sigismund came to Rome for his coronation as Emperor, Ciriaco was his guide among Rome's antiquities. Two years later in 1435, Ciriaco was back exploring in Greece and Egypt. He was probably the first traveler who recognized the importance of the ruins of Eretria. On 5 April 1436, he described and sketched a plan of the ancient city walls, indicating the position of the theatre and the fortifications of the acropolis and mentioning the existence of inscriptions. He collected a great store of inscriptions, manuscripts, and other antiquities. Through a drawing made for Ciriaco, the appearance of the Column of Justinian is recorded for us, before it was dismantled by the Ottomans. He returned in 1426 after having visited Rhodes, Beirut, Damascus, Cyprus, Mytilene, Thessalonica, and other places. Pushed by a strong curiosity, he also bought a great number of documents which he used to write six volumes of Commentarii (\\"Commentaries\\"). The ravages of time have been unkind to Ciriaco's lifework, which he never published, but which fortunately circulated in manuscript and in copies of his drawings; the Commentarii were lost in the 1514 fire of the library of Alessandro and Costanza Sforza in Pesaro. A series of Pizzicolli's manuscripts about Ancona was destroyed during a fire of the city's archives in 1532. He retired to Cremona, where he lived so quietly that the year of his death is not certain. Long after his death, some surviving texts were printed: Epigrammata reperta per Illyricum a Kyriaco Anconitano (Rome, 1664), Cyriaci Anconitani nova fragmenta notis illustrata, (Pesaro, 1763) and Itinerarium (Florence, 1742).

Armies would scour the entire country, confiscating the weapons of the enemies of the new regime. In this manner, the new ruler sought to ensure that no one could take the country by force as he had just done. The most famous sword hunt was ordered by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1588. Sword hunts in the Sengoku period Prior to the sword hunt called by Oda Nobunaga towards the end of the 16th century, civilians were free to carry swords for defense or simply for decoration. Nobunaga sought an end to this practice, and ordered the seizure of swords and a variety of other weapons from civilians, in particular the Ikk≈ç-ikki peasant-monk leagues which sought to overthrow samurai rule. In 1588, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, having become kampaku or \\"imperial regent\\", ordered a new sword hunt; Hideyoshi, like Nobunaga, sought to solidify separations in the class structure, denying commoners weapons while allowing them to the nobility, the samurai class. In addition, Toyotomi's sword hunt, like Nobunaga's, was intended to prevent peasant uprisings and to deny weapons to his adversaries. This hunt may have been inspired by a peasant uprising in Higo Province the year prior, but also served to disarm the s≈çhei of Mount K≈çya and T≈çnomine. Toyotomi claimed that the confiscated weapons would be melted down and used to create a giant image of the Buddha for the Asuka-dera monastery in Nara. \\"Taik≈ç's Sword Hunt\\", as it came to be called, was accompanied by a number of other edicts, including the Expulsion Edict of 1590, by which Toyotomi sought to establish a census and expel from villages any newcomers who arrived in or after 1590. The chief goal of this was to place a check on the threat posed by r≈çnin, masterless wandering samurai who had the potential not only for crime and violence in general, but for banding together to overthrow Toyotomi rule. Hideyoshi, like most of this period, believed in rule by edict, paying little or no attention to legal principles. While the Sword Hunt ostensibly succeeded in denying weapons to potential rebels, it also created discontent throughout the nation, increasing the number and passion of potential rebels. Sword ban in the Meiji Restoration The Meiji Restoration of the 1860s was the beginning of a period of major modernization and Westernization. In 1871, extensive reforms were passed and executed, abolishing the han system, and thus ending feudalism and the class system. In 1876, samurai were banned from carrying swords. A standing army was created, as was a police force. This \\"sword hunt\\" was performed for, ostensibly, different reasons, and certainly with different methods than those of several centuries earlier. This sword hunt put an end to the class system while the earlier ones were intended to deepen the distinctions between commoners and nobles. Ultimately, however, the result of this sword hunt was the same as the results of its predecessors; the hunt ensured that the only weapons were in the hands of the ruling government and not available to potential dissenters. Today, Japan has a Sword and Firearms Law which, much like gun control laws around the world, governs the possession and use of weapons in public. The purchase and ownership of certain swords within Japan is legal if they are properly registered, though the import and export of such items is tightly controlled, particularly in the case of items that might be labeled as national or cultural artifacts. Swords that are not produced by licensed smiths (including all machine-made swords) are prohibited for individuals. Japanese military swords are legal in Japan if they were made with traditional materials and methods.

Releases There have been two versions of Sim RPG Maker. A Windows version was released on May 29, 1998, in Japan only. Shortly after the first release, there was a console version released on September 17, 1998 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in Japan only by ASCII. Gameplay Simulation RPG Maker 95 was released a year after RPG Maker 95 and allowed the user to create tactical games similar to the Fire Emblem series. While Sim RPG Maker 95 retained the user friendly layout and design of RPG Maker 95 it required a basic understanding of the program to properly use. This style of game is classified as a tactical RPG similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, and Ogre Battle. The program is somewhat limited and inflexible in comparison to other RPG Makers. It comes with a run-time package (RTP) with built-in graphics for animations. Custom graphics can be added, but this is more difficult than in other programs from the RPG Maker series. Graphics are limited to 256 colors, which can cause distortion if two graphics with differing pallets are used on the same map. Files must follow a strict naming convention using letters to designate the type of file, followed by numbers to differentiate the file. For example, a walking graphic for a character class using picture ID 007, could be named CA03_007. The first two letters, \\"CA\\", correspond to \\"character animation\\". The first set of numerical digits correspond to the animation slot used in the animation editor, slot 03. The final set of numerical digits correspond to the picture ID being used, 007. One advantage Sim RPG Maker has over others in the series is that it does not require the installation of the RTP to run a game created by the program. Only the installation of the game is necessary. However, the graphics can only come in BMP file format, creating larger file sizes than the other RPG Maker programs. A game typically involves several maps, each with a starting event or cutscene, the main battle, and an ending cutscene. In between maps, players can be sent to the camp, where they may purchase items, switch out party members, change equipment, or check stats of characters. Maps can be designed with different objectives in mind. The most common objective is defeating all enemies or a specific boss character. In addition, players may have to survive a set number of rounds, move past a specified location, or prevent specified characters from dying. Some maps may even be used strictly for cutscenes, with no battles taking place. Maps are progressed through linearly, but it is possible to send the player to maps out of order, enabling multiple/alternate storyline forks. It is also possible to send the player to a previous map.

He then married a 23-year-old orphan, Lysbeth van der Plas, who exercised a bad influence on de Witte's adolescent daughter. In December 1659 both were arrested for theft from a neighbour.Van Eeghen, P. van (1958) Kinderbescherming 300 en 200 jaar geleden. Maandblad Amstelodamum, December 1958, p. 221-3; Van Eeghen, I.H. van (1976) De familiestukken van Metsu van 1657 en van De Witte van 1678 met vier levensgeschiedenissen. Jaarboek Amstelodamum, p. 88-89. Lysbeth, pregnant, had to leave the city for a period of six years; she lived outside the city walls and died in 1663. Following the arrest of his wife and child, de Witte was forced to indenture himself to the Amsterdam notary and art dealer Joris de Wijs, surrendering all of his work in exchange for room, board, and 800 guilders annually. De Witte broke the contract, was sued by the dealer, and forced to indenture himself further as a result.Crenshaw, P. (2006) Rembrandt's Bankruptcy. The artist, his patrons and the art market in the seventeenth-century Netherlands, p. 85. Several patrons provided de Witte with support, but these relations did not work out well, for he tended to shout at his clients and at people watching him at work in churches. Records tell of his gambling habit and a fight with Gerard de Lairesse. Around 1688 he moved in with Hendrick van Streeck, in exchange for training him as a painter of church interiors. According to Arnold Houbraken, after an argument about the rent, de Witte hanged himself from a canal bridge in 1692. The rope broke and de Witte drowned. Because the canal froze that night, his corpse was not found until eleven weeks later.De Grote Schouwburg (1995) Schildersbiografie√´n van Arnold Houbraken. Samenstelling Jan Konst en Manfred Sellink. Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam, 1680. De Witte initially painted portraits as well as mythological and religious scenes. After his move from Delft to Amsterdam in 1651, de Witte specialized more and more in representing church interiors, and also he painted the old church in Amsterdam from almost every corner. He sometimes combined aspects of different churches to depict interiors of ideal churches, populating them with churchgoers, sometimes accompanied by the dog. De Witte's excellent sense of composition combined with his use of light created atmospheres which seem honest and real. His theme may have been light and how it creates livable space. Sources * E.

The road begins in Bayonet Point at US 19 (SR 55), passes through San Antonio, runs past Saint Leo University, in Saint Leo, and terminates in Dade City at US 98 / US 301 (SR 533). Route description State Road 52 exists primarily as a six-lane commercial strip between US 19 and Moon Lake Road. In 2007, the road was widened to six lanes between Moon Lake Road and Suncoast Parkway, but most of the development taking place here has been residential so far. On the Southeast corner of the Suncoast Parkway interchange, there is a Florida State Police barracks and Florida Division of Forestry fire tower. The road narrows down to four lanes and then two as it enters Fivay Junction and approaches Shady Hills Road, before crossing the Pithlachascotee River. As the road runs along the north side of some agricultural land, it eventually meets with a railroad crossing, and then passes a saw mill before encountering US 41 (SR 45) at a section of Pasco County which is known as Gowers Corner. Plans to widen SR 52 in the vicinity of US 41 include the realignment of both roads. East of US 41 is a community known as the Pilot Country Estates Airport, where residents have their own private airplanes.Pilot Country Estates Airport Beyond that, most of the features surrounding SR 52 consist of fledgling farmland and minor lakes. At least one other gated community exists east of this point. Other sites along this segment include the Dirt Devil's SpeedwayDirt Devils Speedway (Official site) and a concrete factory on the southwest corner of CR 583 (Ehren Cutoff). A winery was established at some point in the early 21st Century and a model aviation club existed in one of two locations along this segment of the road. After a pair of bridges over two dry creeks, SR 52 encounters Bellamy Brothers Boulevard (CR 581 North), which leads drivers north through farms and woods before entering the City of Brooksville. Meanwhile, SR 52 climbs a hill and then drops before approaching the Pasco County Juvenile Detention Center. Almost immediately, the road enters the unincorporated hamlet of PascoOrigins of Place Names (History of Pasco County) as it crosses a former railroad right-of-way that once ran from St. Petersburg to Trilby.History of Railroads in Pasco County (History of Pasco County) The interchange with Interstate 75 (Exit 285) is easily in view of motorists before reaching the former grade crossing, but not without approaching a gated community and two truck stops. Immediately after the I-75 interchange, SR 52 passes by and industrial park and Recreational Vehicle dealership, then curves to the northeast as it crosses another dry creek bridge. The road turns back east as it enters San Antonio and instantly makes a direct left curve into Saint Leo. The north-to- eastbound ramp takes drivers though the St. Leo Abbey Historic District and Saint Leo University on a steep hill. Between CR 579 and Alternate CR 35, there's an CR 52 Alternate along Clinton Avenue south of State Road 52 that has no direct connection to the main road. Immediately after the CR 579 intersection, the road takes another sharp northeast curve, and despite a sharp curve back to the right, continues to move to the northeast. Dade City welcomes eastbound drivers After SR 52 enters the Dade City Limits, it runs along the northwestern border of Pasco High School, until the intersection of Old San Ann Drive and moves north onto 21st Street. Eventually, County Road 41 replaces SR 52 as the designation for 21st Street when it makes a sharp right onto Meridian Avenue, but eastbound SR 52 and southbound CR 41 overlap each other until 17th Street, where CR 41 turns south unexpectedly. As the road divides again east of 10th Street, drivers truly enter the heart of Dade City when they encounter local parkland that was once part of a Seaboard Air Line right-of-way, and then intersects 7th Street (former US 98-301), where the historic Pasco County Courthouse can be found on the southeast corner. After passing by more local government buildings including the Dade City Branch of the Pasco County Library, State Road 52 ends at US 98-301 on the opposite side of the Dade City Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot. This was a Truck Detour for US 98-301 until February 2007. History Former segments of State Road 52, have included Roth Lane, in Saint Leo, and North 21st Street and Lock Street in Dade City.

He is the founder of the Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation, an organization based on the teachings of Pure Land Buddhism. He is known for his teaching of the dharma, and work in promoting inter-faith harmony in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.  Early life He was born in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, China as Hsu Yeh- hong (ÂæêÊ•≠È¥ª, X√∫ Y√®h√≥ng ). See also Chinese version: \\"[http://www.amtb- usa.org/chinese_masters_profile.html Ê∑®Á©∫Ê≥ïÂ∏´: Á∞°‰ªã]\\" He spent thirteen years studying Buddhism and Philosophy under the guidance of Professor Fang Tung-mei (), Changkya Khutukhtu (Á´†ÂòâÂëºÂúñÂÖãÂúñ a master in Mongolian Buddhism), and lay teacher Lee Ping-nan (). He entered the monastic life in 1959, and was ordained at Lintzi Temple at Yuanshan in Taipei, Taiwan. It was then that he received the dharma name of Chin Kung, meaning \\"pure emptiness\\". He has resided in Australia for many years. He has also travelled many times to Hong Kong disseminating the teachings of Pure Land. In 2018, he worked with the British government and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David to promote study in Sinology in order to revitalize the teaching of the ancient sages of China.  Teaching and writing  Chin Kung is well known for using modern technology to spread the Buddha's teachings. His lectures are recorded on audio, video tapes and CDs for wide distribution in many temples, where they can be passed on. He has sponsored the printing and the distribution of Buddhist texts worldwide, as well as portraits and pictures of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, free of charge. In recent years, Chin Kung has emphasized the Infinite Life Sutra and the Pure Land cultivation method of Buddha recitation, mainly featuring the recitation of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's name. Achievements Chin Kung has used Buddhist teachings to bridge gaps and overcome misunderstandings between different faiths through interfaith visits and dialogues, especially in Asia and Australia. In recognition of his achievements, he has been accorded with several awards and honours. In 2002, he was awarded an Honorary Professorship from the University of Queensland and an Honorary Doctorate from Griffith University, Australia. In December 2003, he was appointed the Honorary Founding Patron of the Australian Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Queensland. In April 2004, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Southern Queensland. In June 2004, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Syarif Hidayatullan State Islamic University, Jakarta in Indonesia. In August, he was invited to present a paper at the 2004 Okayama Topia for International Contribution NGO Network Conference on the United Nations. In June 2005, the Most Venerable Chin Kung was appointed as a member in the General Division of the Order of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II. He was recognised for service to the Buddhist community in Queensland, particularly through the promotion of Buddhism and the fostering of interfaith activities between diverse ethnic groups, and to the community through support for educational and health institutions. In 2006, he sponsored and attended the commemoration of the 2550th birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha, which took place in the office of the UNESCO in Paris, organized by the Venerable Tampalawela Dhammaratana, ex-president of the Buddhist Union of France. This event of international scale left a big influence in the Buddhist and non-Buddhist world, through its message of world peace and peace of mind. Since then, many cultural exchanges on \\"religious solidarity, traditional education and world peace\\" have been held at UNESCO. In September 2017, the ‚ÄúAssociation of Chin Kung‚Äôs Friends at UNESCO‚Äù was established at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, aiming to ‚Äúpromote religious unity, restore religious education, and promote traditional culture‚Äù. Understanding of Buddhism Chin Kung categorizes Buddhism in practice into four different types. First, traditional Buddhism, the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni, which is very rare in our days. Second, religious Buddhism, which does not represent the real Buddhism but has become recognized by the society, as temples nowadays no longer practice intense teachings and meditation as they once did. Third, academic Buddhist studies as taught in many universities today, where Buddhism is treated purely as a philosophy. This is not comprehensive as the dharma covers everything essential to human beings. Finally, the total degeneration of Buddhism into a cult, which came into being in the late 20th century, and does great harm to society. Chin Kung tries to correct these misunderstandings and lead the public back to the original form of Buddhism as taught by Sakyamuni Buddha.

The route is a nominally east‚Äìwest limited-access freeway for its entire length. A spur of Rhode Island Route 4, Route 403 serves Davisville and the Quonset Business Park, providing freeway access to Interstate 95 and the northern Providence metropolitan area from the industrial zone. The western terminus of the freeway is at a trumpet interchange with Route 4 in East Greenwich. The route has three unnumbered interchanges along its length, including a junction with U.S. Route 1 in North Kingstown, before terminating at an at-grade intersection with Roger Williams Way and Commerce Park Road in Quonset. Route 403 is the highest numbered route in Rhode Island. Prior to 2006, Route 403 was a narrow, two-lane road through Davisville. The western terminus of the route was at an interchange with Route 4 and Rhode Island Route 402 in East Greenwich, and the eastern terminus was at U.S. Route 1 in North Kingstown. In order to accommodate increasingly heavy commercial and commuter traffic to and from the Quonset Business Park, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation constructed the Quonset Freeway as an upgraded Route 403. The relocation of the route began in 2000 and was constructed in two phases; Phase 1, a freeway from Quonset to Davisville, opened in June 2006. Phase 2 of the relocation project, which connected the freeway with Route 4, was completed one year ahead of schedule in December 2008. Route description= Original Route 403 = The Quonset Freeway passing under Devil's Foot Road, the original Route 403, in Davisville Prior to 2006, Route 403 was a narrow, two-lane road running for through Davisville, Rhode Island. The road, a spur route of Route 4, connected to Rhode Island Route 402 and Route 4 at its western terminus, and was accessible only from Route 4 southbound. Its eastern terminus was at a grade-separated interchange with U.S. 1. The nominally east‚Äìwest route followed a northwestern‚Äìsoutheastern route for most of its length. Route 403 was signed on two local roads, Davisville Road and Devil's Foot Road, in the towns of East Greenwich and North Kingstown. Route 403's original western terminus was at a complex interchange with Routes 4 and 402 in East Greenwich. Both Routes 402 and 403 were accessible from Exit 7 on Route 4 southbound; there was no access to either route from the northbound lanes of Route 4. After the Exit 7 ramp, Route 403 eastbound crossed over Route 4 and began to head in southeastern direction along Davisville Road. Shortly after its western terminus, Route 403 crossed the Hunt River into Washington County and Davisville, a village in the town of North Kingstown. After intersecting Old Baptist Road, a local route that connects to Route 102, Route 403 began to follow Devil's Foot Road, continuing on its southeastern trajectory. The route crossed Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line before turning to head in an almost due east direction, entering the Quonset Business Park. Shortly after passing Devil's Foot Rock, a petrosomatoglyph attributed to the Devil in colonial times, Route 403 passed under U.S. Route 1 (Post Road) and intersected two US 1 access ramps, Davisville Road, and Quonset Road; the latter two roads headed into the business park toward Quonset State Airport and the Quonset container port. Although the mainline of the road continued eastbound as Quonset Road (now Roger Williams Way), Route 403 officially terminated at the intersection with the US 1 access ramps. Since the completion of the Quonset Freeway in 2008 and the full relocation of Route 403, the old route on Davisville Road and Devil's Foot Road has been unnumbered. Some portions of the road are signed \\"To RI 403,\\" but there is no indication that RIDOT plans to designate the old route as Rhode Island Route 403A. Route 403's previous alignment was largely unchanged during the construction of the Quonset Freeway; only the interchanges with Routes 4 and 402 in East Greenwich and with US 1 in North Kingstown were altered significantly. =Quonset Freeway= The Quonset Freeway approaching the West Davisville Road overpass The Quonset Freeway begins in East Greenwich at Exit 7 of Route 4; southbound, the exit is numbered 7B, as Exit 7A serves Route 402. Unlike Route 402, which is accessible only via Route 4 southbound, Route 403 is accessible from the northbound lanes of Route 4 via the newly constructed Exit 7. Like the original Route 403, the nominally east‚Äìwest freeway follows a northwestern‚Äìsoutheastern route for much of its length. Shortly after beginning at Route 4, Route 403 crosses over Route 402 and the Hunt River on a single-span bridge, entering the town of North Kingstown. The relocation of Route 403 removed access to Route 402; the freeway now travels over Frenchtown Road without an interchange. While there is no direct link between the two routes, motorists traveling westbound on Route 403 can take the exit for Route 4 south and then access Route 402 from Exit 7A off Route 4. Route 403 continues in a southeastern direction before crossing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line. The freeway begins to closely parallel the railroad before crossing under Devil's Foot Road, the original Route 403, and entering the village of Davisville. Shortly after the overpass, Route 403 turns to head almost due east. The freeway has its first interchange with West Davisville Road; the exit is accessible only from eastbound Route 403, and serves the villages of Davisville and Quidnessett. Closely paralleling Devil's Foot Road, Route 403 continues eastward before interchanging with U.S. Route 1 (Post Road) and Davisville Road; the two roads are served via a single exit. Westbound Route 403 has no direct interchange with either US 1 or Davisville Road; the route's first westbound exit in Quonset is signed as \\"To US 1,\\" and connects to Post Road via Gate Road, a commercial outlet in Quonset. Shortly after the interchange with US 1, Route 403 begins to head in a southwestern direction. After , Route 403 terminates at a traffic signal with Commerce Park Road, a commercial route that heads north into the business park. The mainline of Route 403 continues eastward as Roger Williams Way (formerly Quonset Road), a four-lane, undivided road that leads to Quonset State Airport. History The eastern terminus of Route 403 in the Quonset Business Park The original Route 403 that existed prior to 2006 was numbered in 1973 as a spur route of the newly constructed Route 4. The two-lane, undivided state highway was the main access road to Davisville and Quonset Point from Route 4. Quonset was home to Naval Air Station Quonset Point, a major U.S. naval base, until 1974. After the closure of the base, the Quonset Point region of North Kingstown was converted into an industrial zone and commercial district by the state of Rhode Island; a container port and the Quonset State Airport were also opened for commercial use. By the 1980s, more than 12,000 cars were using Route 403 daily to access the business park; the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) estimated that this vehicle volume would exceed 25,000 by 2005. This high vehicle capacity would be dangerous because of Route 403's sharp curves and low speed limit in Davisville. The narrow route through a densely populated region was particularly unsuitable for the high volume of commercial trucks that used it to access Route 4 from the Quonset Business Park and container port. RIDOT began studies on improving the route in 1987, exploring both the widening of the existing route to a four-lane, undivided highway and the construction of a freeway as options. The proposal to widen the existing road was ultimately dropped, as it would less effective at relieving congestion in the region and would require significant demolition of existing structures in Davisville. A freeway alternative to be constructed north of the existing route with more direct access to Route 4 and an eastward expansion beyond US 1 into the Quonset Business Park was selected instead. =Construction of the Quonset Freeway= Diagram of the eastern terminus of Route 403 in North Kingstown Construction of \\"Phase 1\\" of the four-lane, limited-access Quonset Freeway began in 2000 with excavation of the route and right-of-way acquisition; the project required the demolition of 13 structures, five commercial and eight residential. Phase 1 included an extension of the highway into the Quonset Business Park and the construction of several overpasses in Quonset, an exit ramp to Gate Road, a full interchange with U.S. Route 1 in North Kingstown, and a partial diamond interchange with West Davisville Road in Davisville. During Phase 1's construction, traffic was maintained on the existing Route 403 (Devil's Foot Road); the only major alteration to the route was the setting of a new eastern terminus of the road at US 1, as the previous terminus was demolished to allow for the construction of the freeway. Phase 1 cost $70 million to complete and was opened to traffic on June 22, 2006. The new freeway was posted with a speed limit of . From 2006 until 2008, while Phase 2 of the relocated Route 403 was constructed, traffic on the newly completed freeway from Quonset to Davisville was redirected onto Davisville Road (the original route alignment), which continued on to the existing terminus at Routes 4 and 402. Traffic was diverted onto the original route alignment after the West Davisville Road interchange, passing over the Amtrak rail tracks via the existing Devil's Foot Road overpass bridge. The new Exit 7 off Route 4 north Construction of the $100 million-Phase 2 of the Quonset Freeway began in 2004 and continued until 2008. The project included the construction of new bridges over the Northeast Corridor rail line, Route 402, and Route 4. The existing Route 403 bridge over Route 4 was also demolished as a part of Phase 2. The freeway and ramps from Route 403 west to Route 4 north and from Route 4 south to Route 403 east opened on October 23, 2008. The route was posted with a speed limit of . The final portion of Phase 2, ramps from Route 403 west to Route 4 south and from Route 4 north to Route 403 east, opened in December 2008. As part of the construction of a trumpet interchange with Route 4 in East Greenwich, a new northbound Exit 7 on Route 4 was completed; the original Route 403 was accessible only from Route 4 southbound.

The generated text is based on another text using the Markov chain technique. The name is a play on \\"Associated Press\\" and the psychiatric term dissociative identity disorder (which may result in somewhat similar word salad during quick switches between personalities). An implementation of the algorithm is available in Emacs. Another implementation is available as a Perl module in CPAN, Games::Dissociate.Burke, Sean M. and Avi Finkel. Games::Dissociate distribution in CPAN. Retrieved 2012-11-13. Most recent release: 2010, \\"v1.0\\". The algorithm The algorithm starts by printing a number of consecutive words (or letters) from the source text. Then it searches the source text for an occurrence of the few last words or letters printed out so far. If multiple occurrences are found, it picks a random one, and proceeds with printing the text following the chosen occurrence. After a predetermined length of text is printed out, the search procedure is repeated for the newly printed ending. Considering that words and phrases tend to appear in specific grammatical contexts, the resulting text usually seems correct grammatically, and if the source text is uniform in style, the result appears to be of similar style and subject, and takes some effort on the reader's side to recognize as not genuine. Still, the randomness of the assembly process deprives it of any logical flow - the loosely related parts are connected in a nonsensical way, creating a humorously abstract, random result.

Wright's diminutive stature - he was only tall - and Northern Irish accent became assets to the comedy. Biography Born in Belfast, the eighth of twelve children to George Wright and Agnes Finlay, Wright first worked as an automobile body assembler, even working in the United States for Cadillac. When the Great Depression took hold, Wright returned to Belfast and then began working in the field of entertainment, first as a musician and then as a supporting comedian. He did not enter television until the 1960s, when Hill discovered him and persuaded him to join his troupe. At the time, Hill was ending his stint with the BBC, and starting a 20-year relationship with Thames Television. Hill usually referred to him as \\"Little Jackie\\" or \\"our little Donny Osmond\\" on the programme. In many of the show's trademark accelerated-motion scenes, Hill would often pat Wright's bald head rapidly, the motion being accompanied by dubbed-in smacking sounds. Actress Suzy Mandel claimed that \\"Jackie Wright was a chain smoker and he would often hide his cigarette in his mouth or behind his back during scenes. In fact, you could often see a little plume of smoke rising behind him if you looked close enough. Benny would slap his head to fan the smoke away.\\" Wright also appeared on the short-lived 1973 programme Whoops Baghdad starring Frankie Howerd, and had a small role in the musical comedy film Three for All in 1975. He gained a cult following when edited-down versions of the Benny Hill programmes began airing in syndication in the US in the late 1970s. Death Wright left the show in 1983 owing to poor health. Five and a half years later, he died at the age of 83 in a Belfast hospital after battling a long, undisclosed illness. At the time of his death, Benny Hill remarked, \\"He was a lovely little fella...

Life Aston was born in Staffordshire, England, about 1584; he was a son of Sir Edward Aston of Tixall and his second wife Anne Lucy Barnes of Charlecote Park. On his father's death (1 February 1597) Edward Coke, the Attorney General, was appointed his guardian, by Lord Burghley, master of the Court of Wards. In 1603, at the coronation of King James I of England, Aston was honoured with the Order of the Bath at which Michael Drayton the poet acted as his esquire (Aston had become his patron and between 1602 and 1607 Drayton dedicated five of his works to Sir Walter). In 1611, after paying a fee of ¬£1095 Sir Walter was created Baronet of Tixall. In 1618 he was appointed steward of the honour of Tutbury by James I. In 1622, Sir Walter was sent to Madrid as the resident ambassador to the Spanish court to negotiate a marriage between Charles, the Prince of Wales, and the Infanta Maria Anna of Spain and also provisions for joint naval operations to patrol and suppress piracy. The Prince of Wales (the future Charles I of England), accompanied by the Duke of Buckingham, arrived at the Spanish court in 1623 unannounced: his overtures to the Infanta were rejected and so the marriage proposal fell through. Despite the failure of Aston's mission, for his good service to Charles (in opposing the opinions of the ambassador John, Earl of Bristol), Charles was grateful to him and once he became King helped Sir Walter both socially and financially. Charles pardoned Sir Walter for recusancy (while in Spain he had converted to Catholicism in 1623): this allowed him to serve in local government and in 1631 he was made a commissioner for Warwickshire to enforce a fine upon gentry who failed to appear at Charles's coronation to receive a knighthood. Lords Aston of Forfar. Sir Walter claimed that his expenses in Spain had been ruinous, and cost him ¬£14,000. To make amends Charles arranged that he be elevated to the Scottish peerage on 28 November 1627, as Baron Forfar in county Angus, and gave him a bond of ¬£1000 to buy land in Scotland. Charles also appointed him \\"keeper of the king's mulberry garden\\" at St James's with an annual income of ¬£60. He also arranged an annual pension of ¬£50 for Sir Walter and the same for his wife. Just over a year later in December 1628 \\"a warrant was issued to prepare a bill for a privy seal to pay out of the exchequer ¬£14,000 to cancel his debt\\". This largesse did not totally satisfy Lord Forfar who grumbled to Secretary Conway that it would have been better if the barony had been in recognition of \\"the ancient house of Tixall\\". Lord Forfar returned as envoy to Spain in 1636, and although the dispute over the restoration of the Palatinate to the new Elector Palatine (the Winter King having died) remained intractable, Lord Forfar gave assistance to twenty-seven lawsuits involving English merchants in Spanish courts. His health failed, and he returned to England in the spring (March‚ÄìMay) 1638, but did not recover and died on 13 August 1639. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Stafford. He was succeeded by his son Walter Aston, 2nd Lord Aston of Forfar. Family Walter Aston's father died in 1597, leaving him with the Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke as his legal guardian. Aston married Anne Barnes in 1600 without his guardian's permission; Coke subsequently had the marriage dissolved. In 1607 Coke gave permission for Aston to marry Gertrude, only daughter of Sir Thomas Sadler of Standon and his second wife Gertrude Markham; Gertude was the granddaughter of the leading Elizabethan statesman Sir Ralph Sadler.The Visitations of Hertfordshire, Sir Richard St. George, Robert Cooke, John Philipot, Walter Charles, Harleian Society, London, 1886 They had several children: * Walter, who died in infancy. * Walter, who became 2nd Lord Aston.

The doctrine was originally created by case law based on the principles of comity. In the United States, exhaustion of remedies is applied extensively in administrative law. Many cases are handled first by independent agencies of the United States government which have primary responsibility for cases involving the statutes or regulations which the agency administers. A person's specific rights and duties depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice. \\"Exhaustion of administrative remedies\\" requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then going to a hearing, and finally using the agency's internal appeal process. Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or \\"exhausted\\", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court. But the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents parties from seeking relief in the courts first. The same process is required under the laws of many, if not all, states. Exhaustion of remedies frequently affects cases of habeas corpus. Federal law, for example, prevents a petitioner from seeking federal relief where the state claims have not yet been exhausted. Generally, the exhaustion requirement permits state courts a \\"...meaningful opportunity to consider the allegations of legal error.\\" The issue of exhaustion of remedies in a criminal law case was before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Harvey v. Horan. References # (b)(1)(A) # Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254 (1986).

His principal seat was Tixall in Staffordshire. Lord Aston was a staunch Royalist during the English Civil War. He was present at the Siege of Lichfield in 1643 and the surrender of Oxford; King Charles I expressed his regret at not being able to reward him as he deserved. After the failure of the Royalist cause he was required to compound for his estates and live in private.

The film tells the story of high school loser Dizzy Harrison (Qualls) who gets himself expelled so that he can move schools and reinvent himself. Learning how to be cool from a prison inmate, he renames himself Gil Harris and is quick to make new friends and soon gains respect from jocks and geeks alike. He begins dating popular girl Danielle (Dushku) and unites a once-divided school, also greatly improving its football team. Eventually, Gil has to face his demons from his old school when they face each other in a football game. The film received generally negative reviews, but was a modest box office success. Plot The film begins with prison inmate Luther speaking directly to the camera to an unseen individual, telling the story of Dizzy Gillespie Harrison, an 18-year- old nerdy high school senior in Austin, Texas. Dizzy is friends with Nora, Kirk, and Glen, who together started a funk rock band called \\"Suburban Funk\\" and are addicted to video games. They attend Rocky Creek High School, where Dizzy is picked on by everyone, especially star football player Barclay. After Tina Osgood touches his arm, causing him to have an erection and embarrassing him as the jocks belittle him, his briefs were yanked from underneath his pants and placed around his head. The school librarian \\"breaks\\" his penis after Dizzy refuses to \\"hand\\" over the \\"weapon\\" to her. Dizzy is misdiagnosed with Tourette's syndrome; he is then placed on medication by the school counselor who advises his father to spend every moment possible with him. While at the mall's food court, the heavily-medicated Dizzy makes a fool of himself at a church revival and gets arrested. In jail, Dizzy meets Luther, who turns out to be a sympathetic ex-victim who makes it his goal to teach him how to be cool. In an attempt to wipe the slate clean, Dizzy gets himself expelled from his old high school, then undergoes a makeover with the help of the prison inmates and guards. Changing his name to \\"Gil Harris\\", he enrolls at East Highland High and makes an impression by being dropped off in a prison van in restraints and beating up the school bully, Connor. The action has the intended effect, and head cheerleader Danielle welcomes the newcomer to school. Her friend Courtney invites Dizzy to a party and through a mishap, Dizzy gives Courtney the impression that he has blown her off. Using a photo given to him by the prison inmates and help from his old friends, Dizzy manages to escape the party with his reputation intact. Upon returning home, however, he finds his father has agreed to sell his house and quit work to supervise him, which results in the pair living in a trailer. Danielle asks Dizzy to encourage the school to go to see the football team play, Dizzy, referencing General Patton and Braveheart, gives an impassioned speech, inspiring the team to win their first game in years. He is soon enlisted by the coach and principal to plan the school's homecoming dance, and becomes imbued with school spirit, shedding his bad boy image. Danielle breaks up with Connor and starts a relationship with Dizzy. However, Dizzy and Gil are fast becoming too big for one body. When Nora berates Dizzy for becoming the same person he once hated, he uses his newfound popularity to confront Connor. Dizzy and Danielle spur the students to reunite, and the lines dividing the different cliques are broken. With a new philosophy, the school football team wins more games and bullying becomes a thing of the past. Reaching the state championship, where they play Rocky Creek, Dizzy's antics on the sideline cost Rocky Creek the game. After Rocky Creek's lost to East Highland, Barclay slowly starts realizing who Gil really is. East Highland High celebrates their victory. At school the next day, while East Highland still celebrates, Barclay confronts and attempts to fight Dizzy, but before he can do anything he is attacked by the entire student body. After the attack, Connor helps up Barclay from the ground, telling him he wants to know what he knows about Dizzy. The homecoming dance, which Dizzy's funk band is supposed to play, is crashed by the students of Rocky Creek. Barclay and Connor, who have joined forces to set a trap for Dizzy, play an embarrassing video of the librarian incident. However, Luther and the other inmates arrive to save Dizzy, tying up the two bullies. Nora admits longstanding feelings for Glen, and Danielle reveals to Dizzy that she was also a nerd growing up. She forgives him for hiding who he was and they kiss. Luther ends the film, and the man he is talking to is revealed to be David Hasselhoff. In a mid-credits scene, Dizzy and Danielle mount a horse and ride off into the sunset together.

Games=3D series=Fighter Maker Part of Agetec Inc.'s Designer Series, Fighter Maker is 3D-based and allows users to create custom moves for their fighters. Despite the unique concept, the game received very bad reviews as there was little to do once a fighter had been created. The Official PlayStation Magazine gave the game 3/10, saying that the animation was rough, and that it was \\"not one eighth as interesting as it sounds\\".Official PlayStation Magazine, Future Publishing issue 59, (June 2000) The Japanese edition of the first FM game is also known for having one licensed character, Street Fighter EXs Skullomania, complete with the original move list. =Reception= IGN commented that \\"When you actually put the character into the game, controls are pretty tight and solid\\", and concluded by saying that \\"Fighter Maker is one of the most unique software packages on the PlayStation. I'm guessing we're going to see a ton of websites dedicated to characters gamers have created, uploaded with the handy-dandy DexDrive. The competition between friends is going to be fierce. Who can create the coolest, most utilitarian character in the game?\\" Fighter Maker 2 Fighter Maker 2 (FM2) for the PS2 was another entry in the Designer Series from Agetec Inc. It was released in November 2002. It is similar to the original, but with more advancements in character design, movement, and attacks. As with the first, the game was met with lukewarm reviews, mainly due to its cumbersome interface and the lack of bells and whistles that were featured in most fighting games at the time. The Music was composed by the U.K. band INTELLIGENTSIA, who also created the in-game FX; MIRAI, one of the band's 2 members, is a playable character in the game. =Reception= GamePro said that \\"the freedom in creating move animations is immense.\\" PSM said \\"For those who've thought they could build a game with the right tools, this is a fine toolbox. Aspiring fighter makers are warned, though - it's also an unforgiving school.\\" =2D series=2D Fighter Maker 95 2D Fighter Maker 95 (FM95) was released for Windows prior to ASCII's departure from gaming. Unlike its PlayStation counterparts, this version focused on 2D-style gameplay, allowing the user to create and import their own characters, sounds and graphics into the engine, allowing for far more flexibility and range than the PS versions. The program was pirated and fan translated to English and released on the Internet, where it found a large following amongst dojin game makers and the M.U.G.E.N. community. 2D Fighter Maker 2nd 2D Fighter Maker 2nd (FM2K) was released by ASCII's successor company, Enterbrain. An update to the original version, FM2K allowed for a greater amount of expansion and extension than FM95, revising much of the original engine to allow more options while adding a menu-based system for clarity. As with the previous version, it became wildly popular amongst the dojin communities in Japan. Again, piracy and a fan translation followed, though the second version has yet to meet with the success of the first, primarily due to the large amount of M.U.G.E.N. communities already in operation as well as the incomplete translation of the FM2K software and documentation. This also lead to the creation of 2D Fighter Maker 2015, re- created version of the translated 2D Fighter Maker 2nd by WindowsLogicProductions.

It is owned and was developed by the Cordish Company; it was designed by Louisville architects, Bravura Corporation. Fourth Street Live! first opened to the public on June 1, 2004, and all stores were completed for the grand opening on October 30, 2004. City planners hoped that the district would attract further commercial business development while providing an attractive entertainment venue for the city's hotel and tourist business as well as the local population. The large Hard Rock Cafe sign greets visitors to Fourth Street Live! Restaurants and entertainment venues in the complex include Gordon Biersch Brewing Company, Hard Rock Cafe, T.G.I. Friday's, Birracibo, The Sports & Social Club (bowling alley and restaurant), Tavern on 4th street, The Fudgery and the new bourbon raw bar. Fourth Street Live! also has a variety of bars and nightclubs including Tavern on Fourth, The Sports & Social Club, Howl at the Moon, and PBR Louisville. A mall-style food court is also located in the complex with restaurants like Subway, and Philly Station. There are also retail stores including Footlocker and T-Mobile. Traffic on 4th Street through the complex is usually closed for large public gatherings such as music concerts and other events. History= Background= Fourth Street Live! opened in Downtown in 2004 Fourth Street Live! began as a downtown revitalization project to redesign and modernize the former Louisville Galleria, a similar but unsuccessful project opened in the early 1980s with the same goals of revitalizing downtown. The Galleria, in turn, had been built on the site of the River City Mall, which opened in 1973, also with similar goals of revitalizing downtown. Fourth Street itself had long been the main shopping and entertainment destination in Downtown Louisville. The idea of turning Fourth Street into a pedestrian mall actually dates back to 1943, when mayor Wilson W. Wyatt suggested the idea. Proposals were drafted over the years but funding for the $1.5 million River City Mall project was not secured until 1971. The Mall originally stretched all the way from Liberty to Broadway, and was initially successful, but over the years vehicular traffic was slowly reintroduced and the mall scaled back. =Tenant changes= Many people crowd into the center during the frequent free concerts given by local and national performers. On February 16, 2007, the Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau opened its new Visitor Information Center at the North entrance to Fourth Street Live. The new center totals nearly , and includes two permanent exhibits, where visitors can learn about the stories of two of Kentucky's most famous icons: Kentucky Bourbon and Colonel Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The center will also supply information to outside passersby via a high-tech video wall that will run video on different cultural events and attractions. =Expansion= On May 8, 2017, the Cordish Company announced that it will expand the district with the addition of Spark Louisville, a new collaborative workspace coming in 2018.Insider Louisville Events Some events held at Fourth Street Live! in the past have included national acts in concert, such as Kid Rock, 3 Doors Down, O.A.R., Sister Hazel, VHS or Beta, Goo Goo Dolls, Tracy Lawrence, Jason Michael Carroll, Jake Owen, Jason Aldean, Eric Church, Clay Walker, Three Dog Night, !Smack Talk!, Phil Vassar, Buddy Jewell, Emerson Drive, Finger Eleven, The Marshall Tucker Band, Little Texas, Blue October, Shiny Toy Guns, Gavin Degraw, Violent Femmes, Gretchen Wilson, Justin Bieber The Big Band Theory-USA and many others. The University of Louisville's annual \\"Run for the L of It\\" 5K begins and ends at Fourth Street Live. Also, the finish line of the Louisville Ironman Triathlon, which debuted in 2007, is located at Fourth Street Live. The Venue also holds annual events celebrating the Kentucky Derby and was the \\"Cup Village\\" when Louisville hosted the 2008 Ryder Cup and often holds pep rallies and celebrations for the University of Louisville's athletic teams including for the teams that made the 2005 Final Four, 2007 Orange Bowl, and the 2007 College World Series. During the Summer, Fourth Street Live hosts Summer Concert Series, which is a series of concerts featuring top national acts.

The weekly one-hour program covered international current affairs and was last hosted by veteran journalist Aaron Brown. Wide Angle began broadcasting on PBS in 2002, and aimed to expand the awareness and understanding of Americans about the changing world in which they live. It was the only documentary program on American television devoted exclusively to reporting in-depth on international issues. Following its eighth and final season it was nominated for a 2010 International Documentary Association Continuing Series award. Production Wide Angle programs consist of long-form, character-driven documentaries exploring pressing international issues through human stories, often followed by an interview with a foreign policy expert to connect the films‚Äô themes to American concerns. The program completed its eighth season in 2009, and in that time it had produced more than 60 films in over 50 countries. Wide Angle also produced a companion website, still extant, and additional educational materials for each film. The program's website includes background information on the issues from the films, interactive features, exclusive video and audio, and full streaming versions of many programs. Additional educational materials are distributed to high schools and colleges. In 2006, Wide Angle's online Window into Global History project earned the Goldman Sachs Foundation's Prize for Excellence in International Education. Previous anchors for the program include Bill Moyers, former Assistant Secretary of State James Rubin, Mishal Husain, and Daljit Dhaliwal. Previous interview guests include Senator Hillary Clinton, UN Deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown, Mexico‚Äôs former Foreign Minister Jorge Casta√±eda, former Ugandan government minister Betty Oyella Bigombe, Nobel Prize Laureates Joseph E. Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, Women for Women International CEO Zainab Salbi, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, writer Arundhati Roy and former U.S. Secretaries of State George Mitchell and James A. Baker III. Episodes The July 2002 pilot episode \\"Saddam‚Äôs Ultimate Solution\\" was hosted by former Assistant Secretary of State and chief State Department spokesman James Rubin. It focused on Saddam Hussein‚Äôs biological and chemical weapons and the wider threat they imply. In a host interview broadcast immediately following the episode, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Richard Perle stated that \\"the thing that is brought home so clearly in this film is the connection among terrorist organizations now implicating Saddam Hussein directly with Al Qaeda\\". Reception Wide Angle programs have won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award, the Sigma Delta Chi Award, the Chicago International Television Hugo award, the Gabriel Award, several top awards from the South Asian Journalists Association (SAJA), citations from the Overseas Press Club, and 22 Cine Golden Eagle awards. The New York Times had a mixed review of the first program \\"Saddam‚Äôs Ultimate Solution\\", especially concerning the interview of Richard Perle by host James Rubin: Focal Point In December 2008, Wide Angle launched, Focal Point, a new online-exclusive documentary program. Like Wide Angle, Focal Point offers a deeper understanding of forces shaping the world today through compelling human stories, with Focal Point providing a venue for shorter, less formal pieces.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/about-the- series/about-focal-point/3807/ In the first episode of Focal Point, \\"From Jihad to Rehab\\", Canadian journalist Nancy Durham reports from a rehabilitation center in Saudi Arabia, where art therapy and religious re- education are being used to reform militant jihadists.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/from-jihad-to- rehab/introduction/3834/ See also *Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports *Frontline *Independent Lens *P.O.V. *Worldfocus ReferencesExternal links * Wide Angle * Wide Angle: Window into Global History - Outreach initiative for the teaching of Global History in high schools. * Category:2000s American documentary television series Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2009 American television series endings Category:PBS original programming Category:Television series by WNET Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Wide Angle (TV program)"},{"id":"2284180","text":"Down Your Way was a BBC radio series which ran from 29 December 1946 to 1992, originally on the Home Service, later on BBC Radio 4, usually being broadcast on Sunday afternoons. It visited towns around the United Kingdom, spoke to residents and played their choice of music. It was initially hosted by Stewart MacPherson, who presented the first twelve shows, but in 1947, after brief hosting spells by Lionel Gamlin and Wynford Vaughan-Thomas, Richard Dimbleby took over its presentation until 1955, then Franklin Engelmann until his death in 1972 when Brian Johnston took over until 1987. In 1975, despite then being the second most popular programme on radio, it was taken off the air as an 'economy measure'. It was subsequently reinstated, after a storm of popular protest. From 1987 until its demise in 1992 it had a different celebrity host every week, who would visit a place of significance in their own liveseffectively turning it into 'Down My Way' and blending it into the then- emerging celebrity culture.

It was developed by necking down a .22 Magnum case to take a .17 caliber (4.5 mm) projectile. Commonly loaded with a 17 grain (1.1 g) projectile, it can deliver muzzle velocities in excess of 775 m/s (2,650 ft/s). Development Left: 17 HMR, Right: 22 WMR The .17 HMR round is similar to rounds developed by dedicated rimfire wildcatters who worked to create a rimfire cartridge with an exceptionally flat trajectory. These wildcatters were seeking to match the ballistics of the obsolete 5 mm Remington Rimfire Magnum, which was made from 1970 to 1974, and was to that point the fastest rimfire cartridge ever produced. With 5 mm diameter barrels and bullets being virtually unavailable at the time (the 5mm RMR was the last commercial 5 mm round until the 2004 release of the centerfire .204 Ruger), the commercially available .17 caliber became their bullet of choice. The .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire was the logical parent case, rather than 5mm RMR (with its unique case head size, which requires a significantly different bolt and magazine), because it was commonly available, and it is a far larger and stronger case than the next largest, the .22 Long Rifle. The .17 caliber wildcats not only met, but far exceeded the 5mm RMR's velocities and flat trajectory. The accuracy of these cartridges was also quite good. However, the downrange energy of the 5mm RMR is superior to both .22 WMR and .17 HMR, so there is still potential in the 5mm rimfire for wildcatters.Centurion resumed manufacture of 5 mm RMR in 2007. Hornady, in conjunction with Marlin Firearms and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (manufacturers in the rimfire rifle market), followed much the same path. With the .22 WMR case as the starting point, a simple barrel change was sufficient for most .22 WMR firearms to chamber the new cartridge. In 2002, the first rifles and ammunition began appearing on the market. While the ammunition was relatively expensive due to the high-performance .17 caliber bullets used, it was still cheaper than most centerfire ammunition. By 2004, CCI, Federal Cartridge and Remington had each introduced .17 HMR ammunition offerings. Availability A .17 HMR round with a ballistic tip (left) compared with a .22 Long Rifle round (right) Cartridges for .17 HMR come with bullets that weigh , , and , and come in designs such as plastic-tipped bullets, hollow points, soft points, and FMJs. The terminal ballistics of the lightweight expanding bullets limit the .17 HMR to small game animals and varmints. .17 HMR ammunition is less common and more expensive than the .22 caliber rimfire rounds, but this is changing as the popularity of .17 HMR rifles gathers momentum.The Borchardt Rifle Corp. sells parts to convert Ruger revolvers to .17 HMR. A case of .17 HMR rounds with hollow points A growing number of companies offer .17 HMR ammunition. CCI Ammunition loads all of the .17 HMR ammunition for the CCI, Federal Cartridge, Hornady, and Remington brands. However, the ammunition is loaded with different bullets to different specifications. Ammunition is also available from Winchester, PMC and Sellier & Bellot. Examples of bolt-action or lever-action rifles that are chambered for (or have variants chambered for) .17 HMR include Armscor M1700, CZ 452, Ruger Model 96, and Steyr Scout. Citing safety concerns about the round's use in semi-automatic firearms, Remington issued a product safety warning and recall notice.  .17 Hornady Mach 2  Following the success of the .17 HMR, the .17 Hornady Mach 2 was introduced in early 2004. The .17 HM2 is based on the .22 LR (slightly shorter in case length) case necked down to .17 caliber using the same bullet as the HMR but at a velocity of approximately in the polymer tip loading.

He is best remembered today as a fortunate survivor of the Popish Plot. He succeeded his father as Lord Aston of Forfar in the peerage of Scotland in 1678; he resided mainly at Tixall in Staffordshire. Family Walter Aston had two wives, the second of whom was Catherine Gage (pictured). He was twice married, first marrying Eleanor Blount Knightley of Soddington in Worcestershire, England, widow of Robert Knightley, and daughter of Sir Walter Blount, 1st Baronet, and his wife Elizabeth Wylde, daughter of George Wylde, by whom he had five surviving children, and who died in 1674. He married secondly Catherine Gage, daughter of Sir Thomas Gage, 2nd Baronet of Firle in Sussex, who died in 1720. By Elizabeth he had four sons who reached adulthood, Edward, Francis, Walter, 4th Lord Aston and Charles, and one daughter Mary, who never married. Edward and Francis predeceased their father and Walter succeeded to the title. Popish Plot Like his father, he was an ardent Roman Catholic, and succeeded to his father's role as the effective leader of the large Catholic community in Staffordshire.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot 2nd Edition Phoenix Press 2000 p.50 As such, he was a principal target of informers during the Popish Plot. His former steward Stephen Dugdale, whom he had dismissed for stealing money to pay his gambling debts, turned on him and gave perjured evidence which sent Aston to the Tower of London in 1679 on charges of conspiracy to kill King Charles IIKenyon, p.157 Dugdale was a charming, educated and plausible man, who made a noticeably different impression on the Government from the unsavoury parade of previous informers like Titus Oates, some of whom, like Thomas Dangerfield, were notorious criminals. Even King Charles, who had up to then been entirely sceptical about the Plot, was so impressed by Dugdale that \\"he began to think there was somewhat in it\\". In the event it proved impossible to find a second witness to the charge of treason against Lord Aston, and even at the height of the Plot hysteria, the judges scrupulously observed the law that a charge of treason required two witnesses. Aston was never brought to trial, and was released on bail in the summer of 1680. He never returned to prison.Kenyon, p.256 Later years Under the Catholic King James II he was in favour at Court, and served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire from 1687 to 1689. After the Glorious Revolution, he remained loyal to James, but no action was taken against him as a result. In his last years he felt sufficiently secure in his position to complain about his exclusion, on the grounds of his religion, from the House of Lords. As his peerage was a Scots title he argued that he should be one of the Scottish representative peers who took their seats in the unified House of Lords after the Act of Union 1707, but his claim to be entitled to sit in the Lords was rejected.Cokayne, G.E Complete Peerage Reprinted in 6 volumes Gloucester 2000 Vol.1 p.286 He died in 1714, and was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son Walter Aston, 4th Lord Aston of Forfar.

Several small lagoons are interspersed among the vertical sections of the falls. The falls empty into the Caribbean Sea at the western end of a white-sand beach. Tourism Climbing the waterfalls is a popular tourist activity and is often, but not exclusively, performed with the help of tour guides from the park. It takes about 1-1.5 hours to climb with short breaks for photographs and video recordings taken by the guides. There are also stairs alongside of the falls for those who do not want to get wet or are unable to manage the rocky, uneven terrain of the actual waterfall. The falls are bordered by lush, green vegetation that shades the area from the sun and keeps the area, and climbers, cool. The climb can be relatively hard so is often undertaken as a hand-holding human chain led by a guide to make it easier. History Dunns River Falls plaque The falls were the location where the Battle of Las Chorreras took place in 1657, when the British defeated a Spanish expeditionary force from Cuba.

They were the first of their genre to play at Dallas Cowboys Stadium, at the halftime show of the 2011 Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Redskins game, also at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. They garnered two of the 5 nominations to the Billboard Regional Mexican Awards and got a nod for Best Norte√±o Album to the 2011 Latin Grammy for their album INTOCABLE 2011. They were also nominated for a Grammy for the album. INTOCABLE 2011 was released under the group's own music label Good-i Music and the first two singles, Robarte Un Beso and Promet√≠, went to Number 1 on US regional radio charts. The 3rd single Arrepientete also did very well on radio and their 4th single Llueve was premiered live onstage at the 2012 Premio lo Nuestro where the group swept with all three categories they were nominated for. On October 12, 2015, Intocable made history by streaming a showcase for the whole world, in which more than 22,000 people tuned in. 100% of the proceeds were donated to St. Jude Hospital to help children affected with cancer; there the inception of #AyudaAAyudar was formed and will continue to do events to raise funds for this noble cause. On January 23, 2016, Intocable announced their partnership with St. Jude, a pledge first of its kind in the music industry. Today, their support not only creates awareness for the cause, but their pledge of support contributes to assure that families pay for nothing and can focus on letting their children live. Intocable headlined SXSW 2016 SXAmericas All Latino Showcase, making Intocable the first Latino act to headline this three-day series of charity beneficiary concert events. The group took over the largest SXSW stage, which attracted more than 50,000 attendees over the three-day period. In the early 1990s, the band's first indie albums barely sold. In February 1994 their album Fuego Eterno, with new label EMI Latin, had notable sales. The music of Ram√≥n Ayala influenced the direction of the band. The band's lead vocalist and accordion player, Ricky Mu√±oz has stated that Ayala is his biggest inspiration. In 1997, the band suffered a setback when two members of the band left to form their own group‚ÄîJohnny Lee Rosas, (bajo sexto and 2nd voice), and Albert Ramirez, (bass), formed Grupo Masizzo. Rosas rejoined the group in 2003 after four successful solo albums. In July 2017, Intocable performed their first ever concert in Toronto, Ontario, Canada._ Road accident On January 31, 1999, two band members, Jos√© √Ångel Farias and Silvestre Rodr√≠guez, along with road manager Jos√© √Ångel Gonz√°lez were tragically killed in an accident while driving to Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico's General Mariano Escobedo International Airport to catch a flight to Mexico City. The group's van blew a tire, causing the vehicle to roll off Mexican Federal Highway 40 and crash. After rolling over, Ricky Mu√±oz was the only one left in the van due to him wearing his seat belt on while the other members were laying on the side of the highway. Mu√±oz and the remaining members of the group suffered multiple injuries and spent weeks in a Monterrey hospital. After a six-month layoff, Intocable toured successfully behind the comeback album Contigo (With You), whose first single was entitled \\"El Amigo Que Se Fue\\" (The Friend That Has Left), a tribute song to the fallen band members. Most popular songs The following are some of Intocable's songs that reached the top ten on Billboard singles charts: No Te Vayas, Vivir Sin Ellas, ¬øD√≥nde Est√°s?, Eres Mi Droga, Amor Maldito, So√±ador Eterno, Perdedor, El Amigo Que Se Fue, Ya Estoy Cansado, Ens√©√±ame A Olvidarte, Est√°s Que Te Pelas, D√©jame Amarte, Sue√±a, M√°s D√©bil Que T√∫, El Poder De Tus Manos, Muy A Tu Manera, Eso Duele, Soy Un Novato, Si Pudiera, Invisible, ¬øA D√≥nde Estabas?, Tiempo, Es Mejor Decir Adi√≥s, Contra Viento y Marea, Aire, ¬øY Todo Para Qu√©?, Alguien Te Va A Hacer Llorar, Por Ella Dame Un Besito, Bast√≥, Tu Adi√≥s No Mata, Ll√©vame En Tu Viaje, Hay Ojitos, Promet√≠, Llueve, Robarte Un Beso, Culpable Fui, D√≠melo, Te Amo (Para Siempre), Arrepentido, Qui√©reme (√Åmame), Te Perdon√≥, No Van A Entender, Me Dueles and Tu Soledad y la M√≠a.

He had one son. Born in Londonderry, New Hampshire, Fisher moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1835, when he established what is believed to have been the first foundry in the city, on the northwest corner of James and Merrick streets, Fisher designed and manufactured the first threshing machines in Canada, basing his ideas on a 1786 model designed by a Scot. He expanded the business with his cousin Calvin McQuesten (who himself would found a powerful Hamilton family), they formed a partnership with two other men, to manage the foundry, with McQuesten remaining in the United States to gain additional necessary funds. The firm experienced difficulties getting established In 1836 Fisher was forced to sell some assets, lay off workers, and seek loans. In the following year, anti- American sentiment was high, owing to the support given by the United States to William Lyon Mackenzie, and it found expression in a refusal to pay bills and threats to burn the foundry. Fisher was ready to leave, but McQuesten convinced him to remain. The latter settled in Hamilton in 1839, and the two partners, by now the sole proprietors of the business, were determined to make it prosper. The foundry expanded during the 1840s, producing a variety of agricultural equipment. In the 1850s, Fisher, in partnership with other foundries, was a contractor for the Great Western Railway in the manufacture of railway cars. The firm of Fisher and McQuesten was moved to Wellington Street in 1855 after a fire destroyed the original premises. Six years later (1857), he sold his interest in the foundry and moved from Hamilton to Batavia, New York. He was elected as a Republican representative to the 41st Congress (1869‚Äì1871), but was unsuccessful in his subsequent re-election bid. During his years in Hamilton, Fisher was an active participant in the civic life of the community. In 1843 he built a fire engine which he donated to the city and which was housed at the James Street Foundry. Fisher also served on the Hamilton city council as an alderman from 1848‚Äì1849, and became the city's fourth mayor (for a one-year term) in 1850. He helped build an orphan asylum donating in 1851 ¬£100 (which according to some sources was his salary as mayor) to the Hamilton Ladies' Benevolent Society for the costs of construction. He served on the building committee with Edward Jackson and Edward Cartwright Thomas, and the asylum (Barton Street Jail) on Wellington Street opened in June 1853.

He was a brother of Nadir Khan, who ousted Habibullah Kalakani (also known as Bacha- ye Saqqow), and uncle of both Zahir Shah and Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan, his eventual successor. His other two brothers are Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan and Sardar Shah Wali Khan. Under his leadership, relatively free 1949 elections were permitted, in response to a mostly middle-class youth movement wanting reforms. However, by the 1952 elections, the policy reverted to strict control. Also during his time as Prime Minister, the Pakistani state was formed following India's independence from the United Kingdom. The Afghans contended that the Pashtuns living in the border regions should be given a choice to join Afghanistan or form an independent state, which led to tense relations with Pakistan from the onset. Afghanistan went through economic troubles in the early 1950s, and having failed at an ambitious irrigation scheme in western Afghanistan, Mahmud Khan was eventually replaced by Daoud Khan.

It runs from the Wisconsin Border north of Winthrop Harbor south to North Chicago, west to Libertyville, and then back northwest to Grayslake, terminating at IL 83 just south of IL 120. The eastern portion of Illinois 137 carries part of the Amstutz Expressway, a short freeway between downtown Waukegan and Lake Michigan. It is also one of two J-shaped state roads in Illinois (the other being IL 157 in southwest Illinois).  Route description  Illinois 137 is called Buckley Road in the northwest-southeast segment, as well as the east- west segment east of Illinois Route 21 (Milwaukee Avenue). Between these segments, in northern Libertyville, business addresses use Peterson Road, however street signs name it Buckley Road, which continues west as Illinois 137 turns northwest. In North Chicago, at the east end of the Buckley Road alignment, the route turns north where it cuts Naval Station Great Lakes into two areas, and becomes Sheridan Road for most of its remaining length to the Wisconsin state line. The exception is the Amstutz Expressway, which runs from Sheridan Road near the southern border of Waukegan to Greenwood Avenue roughly north, where the expressway abruptly ends; Illinois 137 follows Greenwood Avenue west a short distance back to Sheridan Road and continues north through Beach Park, Zion, and Winthrop Harbor before terminating at the state line. Sheridan Road continues north as Wisconsin Highway 32. The Amstutz Expressway is a short, limited-access road located in downtown Waukegan. It was built in the 1970s to ease traffic in Waukegan‚Äôs downtown area, but is now also known as the \\"road to nowhere\\".The Road To Nowhere - Chicago Tribune The , four-lane highway was intended to be a connecting route for the downtown area, but a critical link through the neighboring village of North Chicago was never built, and the factories that the expressway was designed to serve have since closed. Today, the thoroughfare carries fewer than 15,000 vehicles per day. Because it is used so little, this short stretch of highway has been the setting for filming such movies and television programs as Groundhog Day, The Blues Brothers,Ground Hog Day Trivia The Ice Harvest, Batman Begins,Cinema Review.

The inexperienced Spiral Traveller continued the Renaissance- and Baroque-inspired sound of \\"Todeswunsch - Sous le soleil de Saturne\\", but with tighter arrangements and the re-introduction of drum machines. A limited edition of 3,000 copies was initially available alongside the regular edition, and the album has been re-issued at least twice since. Overview The inexperienced Spiral Traveller was the first album to set the sound of Sopor in stone, with its tighter, more expressive arrangements and full utilization of strings and brass. The musical palette was enhanced by the edition of actual violin, cello, and lute players, where synthesizers had been previously used. Drum machines were also integrated with the live percussion on several songs, and production values were at their highest yet with full use of studio techniques, as heard on opening track \\"Sylla'bor√™al\\". Despite this, Anna-Varney Cantodea has publicly stated her distaste for the album, stating: > Hmm... Well... Let's put it this way: The inexperienced Spiral Traveller, > has been the worst album I have ever recorded... And after that... It slowly > got better. Interview with Francesco Pascoletti Viale Mazzini (1999) Similar comments were made about the accompanying remix album, \\"Voyager - The Jugglers of Jusa\\". The subject matter of the album mainly deals with the isolation brought on by Cantodea's illnesses through life. It has been stated in interviews that one illness nearly blinded her permanently, and much of the imagery of the album comes from that episode. The identity of the \\"loyal friend\\" mentioned is unknown (although many fans now believe this reference is primarily to depression), but on the later-released \\"La Chambre D'Echo\\" - Where the dead Birds sing, Cantodea states that \\"this once so loyal friend ..., he's not that welcome anymore.\\"Lyrics to \\"We have a Dog to exercise\\" The song \\"Birth - Fiendish Figuration\\" was re-recorded for this album, while \\"May I kiss your Wound ?\\" would be re-recorded for \\"Songs from the inverted Womb\\". In 2004, The inexperienced Spiral Traveller was re-issued with entirely new artwork, including radically new art and liner notes. The new artwork emulates a tourism package, including a passport and the photographs from the older version encapsulated in Polaroid borders. The back cover also featured a mock advertisement for the Synchro-Box, quoted to be \\"the best device to travel the continuum\\". She rerecorded some songs from this album on her 2018 album The Spiral Sacrifice.

Founded in 1820, the society continues to meet every academic Thursday of the fall and spring semesters at 7 pm at Phi Kappa Hall on the University of Georgia's North Campus.About section of official Phi Kappa website. Last accessed 2014-06-10. The Phi Kappa Literary Society holds formal debates and a forum for creative writings and orations as well as poetry. History=Formation= The society was founded by Joseph Henry Lumpkin, William Crabbe, Homer V. Howard, Stern Simmons, John G. Rutherford, and John D. Watkins. They formed the society after splitting from the Demosthenian Literary Society, dissatisfied with how the other society's meetings were being conducted. As Phi Kappa grew larger, makeshift meeting places were no longer appropriate or useful. Through funding provided by member Alexander Stephens, the Phi Kappa Literary Society moved into its permanent residence at Phi Kappa Hall. Phi Kappa Hall was built at a cost of $5,000 and dedicated on July 5, 1836. It is the seventh-oldest building on the University of Georgia's campus, and the Phi Kappa Literary Society currently shares use of the building with the Georgia Debate Union.History section of Phi Kappa's official website. Last accessed 2014-06-10. =Refounding= The Phi Kappa Literary Society has disbanded and reformed many times in its history. The first occurrence was in 1863 due to student enlistment in the American Civil War, which left only five members remaining. Meetings resumed on January 5, 1866. The society flourished in the early 1900s, participating in numerous collegiate debate competitions as well as sending members to compete in international collegiate debate contests. However, a drop in student enrollment due to World War II caused the society to disband again in 1944, and an extremely polarized atmosphere in the society and the university as a whole pulled the Phi Kappa Literary Society apart, seemingly for the final time, in 1973. After sporadic, unsuccessful attempts to revive Phi Kappa, in 1991, Stephanie Hendricks took an interest into the society after prompting from Thomas Peter Allen and was elected as its new president on January 31, 1991. Thirteen new members were inducted shortly thereafter, and the first meeting of the newly refounded society took place on February 14, 1991 in Phi Kappa Hall. Debates and programs In order to become a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society, a University of Georgia student must petition the society for membership, which is a five-week process that culminates in the student delivering a petitioning speech before the society. The student must then be accepted by a vote of the society. Once a student is a full member of Phi Kappa, they must speak at least once every three weeks to maintain membership. = Weekly debates = Each academic Thursday, Phi Kappa holds a pre-planned debate centered around a resolution in the format of \\"Be It Hereby Resolved.\\" Two pre-selected speakers start off the debate with one speech in affirmation of the resolution and one in the negation. These speakers have seven minutes to deliver their speech while all subsequent speakers are limited to five minutes each. The president facilitates the debate, calling on each new speaker until the society is ready to vote. A majority vote of the society decides the winner of each debate. The society abides by Robert%27s Rules of Order for their meeting procedures. = Creative writings and orations = The weekly main debate is followed by an open forum for creative writings and orations. In this section of the meeting, both members and guests can deliver any creative writings they may wish to share, pre-prepared speeches outside of the realms of debate, or extemporaneous speeches. = Intrasociety Debate = Each fall, Phi Kappa holds an Intrasociety Debate between active members and alumni. Active members and alumni form teams of five and prepare a debate based on a resolution, with about a month of preparation time. The resolution is chosen in alternating years by actives or alumni. One team speaks in affirmation of the resolution, and one team speaks in negation of it. The debate is separated into three parts: constructive, rebuttal, and summation. Upon conclusion of the debate, a panel of judges (also made up of active and alumni members) select the winner. =Phi Kappa Declamation= In the spring, Phi Kappa holds the Phi Kappa Declamation, wherein members aim to give their absolute best possible speech from a list of pre-selected topics. This is the most honored practice of the year, emphasizing impeccable rhetoric, writing, and floor presence of the speaker. The Declamation was first introduced in 1994, shortly after the refounding of Phi Kappa. It was previously known as the Alexander Stephens Declamation until Phi Kappa members voted to rename the event in 2019. Campus involvement The Phi Kappa Literary Society often collaborates with other on-campus and off-campus groups to hold special events. In 2013, Phi Kappa sponsored a debate between the Communist Party USA and the Libertarian Party of Georgia.News section of official Phi Kappa website. Last accessed 2014-06-10.

Last accessed 2014-06-10. Their closest tie to another student organization is their 200-year-long rivalry with the older Demosthenian Literary Society. Until 2019, each spring semester Phi Kappa would debate the rival society in the Intersociety Debate. However, in November 2019 the societies revised their longstanding intersociety agreement and eliminated the Intersociety Debate, ending its 28-year history until the agreement is renegotiated in 2022. The societies continue to meet for an Intersociety Meeting each fall.News section of official Phi Kappa website. Last accessed 2014-06-10. Notable alumni *Morris B.

He was also the founder of the Afghan National Liberation Front, and served as the chairman of the 2003 loya jirga that approved Afghanistan's new constitution. In 2005, he was appointed chairman of the Meshrano Jirga, upper house of the National Assembly of Afghanistan, and was reappointed as a member in 2011. He also served on the Afghan High Peace Council. Mojaddedi is considered to have been a moderate Muslim leader.  Early years  Mojaddedi was born on 21 April 1925 in Kabul, Afghanistan. His family, the Mojaddedis, are a well-known family of religious scholars from Kabul who trace their ancestry to Mujaddid Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent 16th-century Islamic scholar and Naqshbandi Sufi. Ethnically, the Mojaddedis are categorized as Pashtuns. Mojaddedi studied Islamic Law and Jurisprudence at al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. In 1952 he returned to Afghanistan to teach in high schools and at Kabul University, where he became known as an advocate of Afghan independence. In 1959 Mojaddedi was accused of conspiring against then Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev and was imprisoned until 1964. In 1973 he was forced into exile for his outspoken comments regarding Soviet influence in Afghanistan. Following the Saur Revolution in 1978, the new communist government killed Mojaddedi's brother and several of his relatives. His period in exile was spent in several countries such as Denmark and Pakistan before his entry into Afghan politics.  Presidency (1992)  During exile in Peshawar, Mojaddedi founded the Jebh- e-Nejat-e Melli (National Liberation Front) group. In 1988, he was elected head of the Afghan Interim Government, based in Peshawar. In April 1992, he was elected the chair of the Islamic Jihad Council that was set up to establish a post-Soviet Afghan government. He entered Kabul on 28 April amid a large crowd and assumed the new Islamic republic, and offered a general amnesty to all Afghans except the deposed President, Mohammad Najibullah, whose fate would be decided by \\"the public\\". His election was supported by all mujahideen guerilla factions except the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, whose forces started firing rockets at the capital; violent clashes took place between them and soldiers of the new coalition near the Interior Ministry building. Mojadeddi pleaded with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to lay down their arms, and commented \\"Mr. Hekmatyar was our brother. We were not expecting such an action. It is not allowed to him according to religion, according to Afghan tradition, to do this.\\" During the period that Mojaddedi was President of Afghanistan, the Ariana plane carrying him to Kabul was hit by an RPG as it was landing at Kabul International Airport. The plane landed safely, with no fatalities. This position lasted for three months, although some sources say that he stayed in power for only two months. In May 1992, Burhanuddin Rabbani established a new leadership council, which undermined Mojaddedi's leadership, resulting in his resignation and handing over power to a new council.  Later political career  After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Mojaddedi returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan and became chairman of the 2003 loya jirga, the assembly which approved Afghanistan's new constitution. He caused controversy there by publicly calling Malalai Joya a \\"communist\\" and \\"infidel\\" after her speech, for which he later apologized.https://www.afghanistan- analysts.org/en/reports/political-landscape/from-sufi-sheikh-to-interim- president-historic-mujahedin-leader-mujaddedi-passes-away/ Amnesty International said that Mojaddedi and the jirga's leadership curtrailed freedom of speech at the assembly,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-freedom- expression-essential-right including refusing to launch a vote on changing \\"Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\\" to \\"Republic of Afghanistan\\" despite getting enough signatures, publicly calling the delegates who signed it \\"unbelievers\\" and \\"apostates\\".https://www.dawn.com/news/346577/mujaddedi-callsdelegates- infidelhttps://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/reports/political- landscape/from-sufi-sheikh-to-interim-president-historic-mujahedin-leader- mujaddedi-passes-away/ In 2005 he became chairman of the Meshrano Jirga, Afghanistan's upper house of the National Assembly of Afghanistan, and he was reappointed as member in 2011. He also served on the Afghan High Peace Council. On 26 August 2015, Mojaddedi launched a new political party, the Council of Jihad and National Political Parties.  Later life and death  Two suicide bombers carried out an attack in Kabul on 12 March 2006 against Mojaddedi, while he was a member of the upper house and head of a reconciliation committee aimed at engaging former Taliban members. The attackers blew up a vehicle filled with explosives next to his car as he was being driven through the streets. Four pedestrians were killed and Mojaddedi was slightly injured, with burns to his face and hands. Mojaddedi was erroneously reported to have died on 9 February 2016. He was subsequently reported to have been present at a ceremony commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan on 15 February 2016. It was reported on 12 February 2019 that Mojaddedi had died. He was 93.

For most of its existence, it competed in Serie A, the highest level of the Ecuadorian professional football league. Deportivo Quito has won five Serie A titles in 1964, 1968, 2008, 2009, and 2011. This places them fifth overall. The club also has four Interandean Tournament titles in 1955, 1956, 1957, and 1963. Additionally, the club was runner up in 1985, 1988, and 1997. Based on its style of play, sports journalists and fans nicknamed the club La Academia de los Ecuatorianos desde 1940 (). Deportivo Quito was officially founded in 1955, although they trace their roots to Sociedad Deportiva Argentina, which was founded on July 9, 1940. Historic rivals include LDU Quito, Aucas, El Nacional, and Universidad Cat√≥lica. They play their home games at Estadio Ol√≠mpico Atahualpa. History The club was founded on July 9, 1940, under the name Sociedad Deportiva Argentina. On October 1, 1954, the club, together with Sociedad Deportiva Aucas & Sociedad Deportiva Espa√±a, founded Asociaci√≥n de F√∫tbol No Amateur (AFNA) de Pichincha (Spanish for Non-Amateur Football Association of Pichincha). This was followed by provincial professional soccer tournaments. In accordance with AFNA bylaws, which stipulated that no team could be named after a country (except after Spain), the shareholders of Argentina got together and changed the club's name to Sociedad Deportivo Quito. The 1950s and 1960s were fruitful decades for Deportivo Quito with the club obtaining National Championship titles in 1964 and 1968 as well as Interandean Championships (named so for inclusion of teams from both Quito and Ambato) in 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1963. The 1970s were a dark period for the club, which descended and spent several seasons in the second tier Serie B of the Ecuadorian Football League. The 1980s and 1990s brought a return measure of success for the club which came in as runners up in 1985, 1988, 1997 and qualified to participate in Copa Libertadores. 1989 also saw the transfer of one of the brightest players in Ecuadorian soccer history, √Ålex Aguinaga to Necaxa of Mexico. The club would wait forty years for its third championship and after a brilliant campaign in 2008, which saw Deportivo Quito in the lead throughout the tournament, the team sealed its third star against Macar√° of Ambato. 2009 began fraught with problems for the club. Although it was able to hold on to its star player Luis Saritama on loan, economic problems dogged the club throughout the year. As a result, early tournament action saw the club mired in the middle half of the table. The next two phases of the tournament were a different story as the defense, solidified with the incorporation of the Ecuadorian National team captain Ivan Hurtado, led the club to top of the table finishes. This set up the final play-off against Deportivo Cuenca. Following a 1‚Äì1 tie in Cuenca, the two teams played an exciting game in Quito which saw back and forth action ending 3‚Äì2 in favor of Deportivo Quito. The team's fourth star was not nearly as elusive as the third. In the 2010 season Deportivo Quito earned a third-place finish after surpassing Barcelona SC in a home and home play-off. 2011 saw a dominating performance from Deportivo Quito, in which they won 26 games, tied 11 and only lost 9. Following 1‚Äì0 victories over Emelec in Quito and Guayaquil, Deportivo Quito earned its fifth star. Fans celebrated the long- awaited 2008 as well as the follow-up 2009 and 2011 championships in the popular Plaza del Teatro in Quito. Stadium Their home games are played in the Estadio Ol√≠mpico Atahualpa in the city of Quito but there have been plans to build a stadium for the year 2010 on their current training grounds Ney Mancheno in Carcel√©n. On November 13, 2008, Deportivo Quito's management presented the model of the new stadium. This stadium will have a capacity of 20,000 people. The building project includes the construction of a shopping mall attached to the same stadium that will serve as a source of revenue for the institution.

It is divided by the Panjshir River. The valley is home to more than 100,000 people, including Afghanistan's largest concentration of ethnic Tajiks. In April 2004, it became the heart of the new Panjshir Province, having previously been part of Parwan Province. It was the site of the Panjshir offensives fought between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviets against the mujahideen during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War from 1980 to 1985, when local commander Ahmad Shah Massoud successfully defended the valley from being taken. The valley again witnessed renewed fighting during the 1996‚Äì2001 civil war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance under the command of Massoud, where he again defended it from being overrun by the Taliban.https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2002/02/junger200202 As of 2016, the Panjshir Valley is considered one of Afghanistan's safest regions.https://www.thenational.ae/world/foreign-kayakers-surprise-afghans-in- the-panjshir-valley-1.136676  Name  The name Panjshir, literally meaning \\"Five Lions\\", widely believed that it refers to five Wali (literally, protectors), highly spiritual brothers who were centered in the valley. Local legend has it that the five brothers built a dam for Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the early 11th century AD. The foundations serve today for a modern reservoir. However, the name Panjshire was used by Arab conquerors in the 7th century which means the legend of five Wali must have existed before the 11th century.  Economy and natural resources  The Panjshir Valley has the potential to become a major centre of emerald mining. As early as the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder commented on gemstones from the region. In the Middle Ages, Panjshir was famed for its silver mining and the Saffarids and Samanids minted their coins there. As of 1985, crystals upwards of had been found there, reported to rival in quality the finest crystals of the Muzo mine in Colombia. American reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan has sparked a development boom in the valley with the construction of new modern roads and a new radio tower that allows valley residents to pick up radio signals from the Afghan capital, Kabul. The valley has the potential of being an energy hub for Afghanistan, through construction of several hydroelectric dams. Rewat locality could be the site of the first dam. The valley could make the capital region power self-reliant. The Panjshir has always been an important highway. Nearly long, it leads to two passes over the Hindu Kush ‚Äì the Khawak Pass (3,848 m) leading to the northern plains, and the Anjoman Pass (4,430 m) that crosses into Badakhshan ‚Äì used by the armies of Alexander the Great and Timur. A 10-turbine wind farm was built in Panjshir Valley in April 2008.

He is a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. He won the David Shepherd Trophy three years in a row from 2009 to 2011, after being nominated twice in 2005 and 2006. Aleem Dar, Marais Erasmus, Richard Kettleborough, Kumar Dharmasena and Simon Taufel were the only umpires to have received the award from its inception until 2017. Before becoming an umpire, he played first-class cricket as a right-handed batsman and a leg-break bowler for Allied Bank, Gujranwala, Lahore and Pakistan Railways. In December 2019, in the first match between Australia and New Zealand, Aleem stood in his 129th Test match, breaking the record previously set by Steve Bucknor. Umpiring career Aleem is best known as an international cricket umpire. He made his international umpiring debut in an ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at Gujranwala on 16 February 2000. In 2002 he became a member of ICC's International Panel of umpires. He was chosen to umpire at the ICC Cricket World Cup. In April 2004, he became the first Pakistani to be part of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. He was nominated for the ICC Umpire of the year Award in 2005 and 2006, beaten on both occasions by the Australian Simon Taufel. On 17 October 2007 Aleem umpired in his 100th ODI (between India and Australia at Mumbai), making him the tenth umpire in the history of cricket to reach that landmark. He reached the landmark in a record time, taking just seven years, and became the first Pakistani to officiate in a century of One Day Internationals. Aleem has stood in a solitary India-Pakistan ODI match at Karachi 2006 and five Ashes Test matches. He was also one of the on-field umpires for the final of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, standing alongside Rudi Koertzen. He was appointed to stand in the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup between Australia and Sri Lanka, where he officiated with Steve Bucknor. Dar was also selected to stand in the final of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 between Australia and England . In January 2005, Aleem and his colleague Steve Bucknor, received death threats during a Test match between England and South Africa at Centurion. He was also involved in a controversy during the 2007 Cricket World Cup final where he, along with fellow officials Bucknor, Koertzen, Bowden and Crowe incorrectly made Australia bowl three unnecessary overs in near darkness. Consequently, the ICC decided to suspend him, along with the other four officials, from duty for the next ICC event, which was the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship. Aleem proved his accuracy at the 2011 Cricket World Cup when all the 15 Umpire Decision Review System appeals against him were struck down. He was selected as one of the twenty umpires to stand in matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup. In April 2019, he was named as one of the sixteen umpires to stand in matches during the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The following month, in the second match of the 2019 Ireland Tri-Nation Series, he became the third umpire, and first from Pakistan, to officiate in 200 ODIs. Accolades After being nominated twice in 2005 and 2006, Aleem finally won the Umpire of the Year award in October 2009, at the annual ICC awards ceremony in Johannesburg, South Africa. By claiming the award, Aleem ended Simon Taufel's run of five successive awards. It was the first time that any umpire other than Taufel had picked up the accolade in the six years that the ceremony has taken place.

As with many lesser-known cocktails that are named after colloquial expressions, widely differing recipes share the same name. In the 1970s, ‚Äò80s, and ‚Äò90s the Heublein Company produced the premixed cocktail labeled Brass Monkey. Heublein pre-mixed bottled cocktails were fairly inexpensive and provided a portable alternative to regular mixed drinks. Heublein was based in Stamford, Connecticut, and had production facilities in the Hartford, Connecticut area. The Brass Monkey cocktail was available in bottles from half pint up to 750 ml. During the time Heublein produced Brass Monkey, liquor stores carried mostly beer, wine, and hard alcohol; very few premixed alternatives were available. Steve Doniger, an advertising executive, named the drink after an alleged World War II spy named H. E. Rasske. Allan Kaufman, who crafted a series of stories about the spy, created the ad campaign using an old photo of his father as Rasske‚Äôs image.Scan of a 1971 magazine advertisement for Heublein's Brass Monkey bottled cocktail In 1982, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company acquired Heublein Inc. for $1.4 billion. RJR Nabisco sold the division to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness to form Diageo in 1997. Sales and popularity of Heublein's Brass Monkey spirit cocktail increased in the 1980s after the release of the Beastie Boys's song of the same name. It was widely and incorrectly believed that the Beastie Boys were referring to a different drink made from a 40-ounce container of malt liquor mixed with orange juice (\\"forty\\" is mentioned in the lyrics); however, Mike D has publicly confirmed that the premixed Heublein cocktail was their muse.https://brokelyn.com/mike-d-says-brass-monkey-liquor-cocktail/ After several years of absence from the market the Brass Monkey premixed cocktail has recently been re-released as The Club Brass Monkey. Produced by The Club Distilling Company of Stamford Ct., Brass Monkey is currently sold in liquor stores along with other premixed alcoholic beverages under the name The Club Cocktails owned by Diageo.

Walker was laid down on 31 August 1942 by the Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine; launched on 31 January 1943, sponsored by Miss Sarah C. Walker; and commissioned on 3 April 1943, Commander O. F. Gregor in command. The first seven months of Walker's service took place in the Atlantic where she was engaged in Caribbean escort duty and training exercises in preparation for Pacific combat duty. The highlights of this period included the capture on 7 August of 43 survivors of the which had been damaged by Navy air units off Cuba, and the responsibility of escorting the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Casablanca to participate in the Moscow Conference of October 1943.  1944  Walker transited the Panama Canal on 1 November 1943 and proceeded to join the forces engaged in the conquest of Tarawa. After a month of operations in that area, the destroyer took part in the Marshall Islands campaign from 29 January through 8 February 1944. She joined forces at Funafuti for the invasion of Kwajalein; and, as part of a heavy cruiser bombardment unit, she participated in numerous neutralization bombardments at Wotje and Taroa. The only Japanese resistance encountered came from shore batteries which failed to hit their mark. Walker in 1943. From March through June 1944, Walker operated in the South Pacific escorting troops and transports from Guadalcanal to Bougainville and from various points in New Guinea. Other ports visited during this period were Purvis Bay, Tulagi; Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville; Milne Bay and Buna, New Guinea. The Marianas operation involved the invasion of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam by forces under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Walker began service assigned to an escort carrier unit providing air support for the amphibious forces headed for Guam. The group departed from Kwajalein in June; but, due to the bitterness of the campaign for Saipan, the Guam landings were postponed, and the ships returned to Eniwetok. After the need for further naval support had passed, Walker proceeded to Pearl Harbor for rehearsals of scheduled landings on Yap Island. Leaving Pearl Harbor in September, Walker was transferred to the 7th Fleet as a fire support ship for the invasion of the Philippines. This group of transports and destroyers sailed from Manus and arrived at Leyte Gulf on 20 October. During this operation, Walker experienced her first air action and downed one enemy fighter plane as well as provided gunfire support in the Dulag area. The transports were rapidly unloaded and departed with Walker and other escorts prior to the arrival of the Japanese naval forces and the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf from 24 to 25 October 1944. The group proceeded to Morotai to reload support troops for Leyte. At Morotai, nightly Japanese air attacks harassed the ships but caused little damage. The group then returned to Leyte and unloaded its troops. Suicide air attacks and torpedo bombers were encountered during this trip, but no damage was suffered. After a brief stop at Palau, Walker received orders to return home, and she reached the Mare Island Navy Yard, San Francisco, California, on Christmas Eve 1944.  1945  The most memorable part of Walker's combat service began in mid- March 1945 when, fresh from navy yard overhaul, she joined Admiral Marc Mitscher's famed Task Force 58 (TF 58) at Ulithi, Caroline Islands. This force proceeded to Ky≈´sh≈´ and Honsh≈´, Japan, for air strikes designed to neutralize and weaken Japanese air power. Following these strikes, TF 58 proceeded to Okinawa to support the amphibious assault launched there on 1 April 1945. While alone on picket duty 12 miles from the main group, Walker was subjected to persistent Japanese kamikaze attacks. One plane dropped a torpedo just after dark which passed close astern. During that night, Walker's agile maneuvers and accurate guns beat off three more such attacks. On 7 April 1945, Paul Klahr, Gun Captain of 40 mm Gun 43 (starboard midship position), vividly recalls that a Zeke fighter circled the stern and began diving for the bridge from the starboard side of the Walker. The Zeke passed forward of Klahr's gun position by about 20 feet allowing him and his crew to see the face of the pilot. He remembers the pilot's look of fear, facing his impending death. One member of his gun crew actually threw his helmet at the plane as it passed. The plane flew over the ship between the positions of the five inch guns Gun 1 and Gun 2 at an altitude low enough to part the lifelines on the port side before wheeling into the ocean and exploding, sending a solid sheet of water over the Walker mixed with debris from the plane and the shredded remains of its pilot. After 80 days at sea, the task group returned to port. During this period, Walker towed to Kerama Retto near Okinawa after she had been damaged by kamikaze hits. The destroyer continued operations through July and August with the 3d Fleet and encountered no Japanese air opposition. Walker was among the ships which bombarded Kamaishi, Honsh≈´, Japan, on 18 July and made a similar attack at Hammahatsu and a return trip to Kamaishi. The coming of peace resulted in Walker entering Tokyo after a period of air-rescue duty during the airborne phase of the occupation. On 1 November 1945, Walker arrived from the forward area at San Pedro, California; and, on 31 May 1946, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, at San Diego.  1950 - 1963  Walker escorting HMAS Sydney (R17) off Korea, in 1951. The ship remained in \\"mothballs\\" until 15 September 1950 when she was recommissioned and converted to an escort destroyer. From the time of her recommissioning until 27 February 1951, Walker remained in yard overhaul. Following a shakedown cruise, the escort destroyer departed San Diego and participated in the atomic Exercise Greenhouse at Eniwetok until June 1951. The next month, the ship joined the newly formed Escort Destroyer Squadron 1 based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She remained in Hawaii until November 1951 when she sailed for the western Pacific and joined the United Nations Blockading Force assisting UN ground troops in the Korean War. She escorted the fast carrier task forces which were supporting ground units with strategic air strikes. Thus ended Walker's Korean War service. Walker returned to Pearl Harbor during March 1952 and conducted type training and routine exercises for the next several months. On 2 June, the escort destroyer sailed for her second western Pacific deployment. From that time until 29 December 1963, Walker completed nine such deployments. These very active years were spent, for the most part, conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises and various operations with her task group and elements of the Republic of Korea Navy and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Walker's many \\"People to People\\" visits during this period helped to spread American good will abroad. Highlights of these years included assistance to the town of Koniya, Amami ≈åshima, which had suffered major damage from a raging fire in September 1958 and as a recovery ship for a Project Mercury space flight on 28 September 1962.  1964 - 1965  Walker at Yokosuka, circa 1960. On 4 January 1964, Walker commenced a two-week tender availability at Pearl Harbor with . On 31 January, the ship officially entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for overhaul. The completion of yard overhaul on 30 April marked the commencement of local exercises in preparation for refresher training. On 19 May, Walker took part in the filming of the movie None But The Brave at the island of Kauai. After a month of refresher training and an administrative inspection, the escort destroyer underwent upkeep which took her through June. The summer months found Walker engaged in local operations. On 17 August 1964, the ship continued her movie career with a supporting role in Otto Preminger's production of In Harm's Way. During October and November, the escort destroyer underwent a pre-employment inspection and an operational readiness inspection which was concluded on 20 November, three days prior to departure for a western Pacific deployment. On 3 December 1964, Walker arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, where she joined in Exercise Tall Back with the aircraft carrier , followed by duties on the Junk patrol which combatted the infiltration of arms into South Vietnam from North Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. During this period, the escort destroyer performed a month of uneventful duty on the Taiwan patrol. Walker participated in an artistic photo of Task Force 77 in 1965. Walker departed Vietnam waters on 27 April 1965 and, after a brief stop at Yokosuka, Japan, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 13 May. The remainder of May and June was spent in leave and upkeep. The escort destroyer spent the rest of the year in local operations. On 8 December, Walker was drydocked and spent the holiday season in leave and upkeep.  1966  Weapon Alpha launch by Walker, circa 1958. January 1966 saw the ship taking part in local operations and making preparations for an upcoming deployment. On 7 February, she commenced a six-month cruise, arriving at Yokosuka via Midway Atoll 10 days later. Duty in the South China Sea began on 28 February with assignments as a planeguard and as a naval gunfire support ship. Walker's first offensive actions of the Vietnam War occurred on 5 March in support of United States and Allied forces. This assignment was interrupted by patrol duty in the Taiwan Strait and rest and rehabilitation at Keelung, Taiwan; and Hong Kong. Walker returned to Qui Nh∆°n, South Vietnam, on 22 April and began support missions, shooting direct fire at the Vietcong coastal supply areas and troop concentrations. The second ship on station, Walker received sporadic machine gunfire from the enemy ashore while a gig was returning with spotters and advisors to the ship for a briefing. This was the first time since World War II that Walker had been subjected to hostile fire. On 26 April 1966, the escort destroyer supplied direct, indirect, harassment, and interdiction support for Operation Osage, a combined amphibious assault at Chu Lai. These duties were interrupted to escort a Marine Corps motor convoy from Da Nang to Phu Bai on 28 April. On 1 May, the ship detached and proceeded independently for repairs at Sasebo, Japan, via Buckner Bay, Okinawa. Walker set course on 17 May for Manila Bay, Philippines, where she joined in SEATO antisubmarine warfare Exercise Sea Imp which lasted until 6 June. The ship next joined for a month of patrol duty in the Taiwan Strait during which time she rescued a Nationalist Chinese fishing boat adrift for 48 hours. The escort destroyer returned to Yokosuka, Japan, on 8 July. Instead of departing for home, Walker received orders to replace in antisubmarine exercises in the Sea of Japan. These exercises included the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and naval units of the Republic of Korea. On 24 July, a Soviet Kotlin-class destroyer was sighted as it commenced shadowing the Allied group. Walker was designated to shoulder the Russian destroyer, and she was successful in preventing the attempted penetration of the screen by the Russian ship and her replacement. Walker also assumed duty on 29 July as a shadow against the Soviet electronics intelligence (Elint) trawler Izmeritel. On 1 August 1966, Walker detached and proceeded to Yokosuka from whence she began the transit to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 August and made preparations for a yard overhaul. Walker entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 19 September and remained in overhaul status for the rest of calendar year 1966.  1967  Regular overhaul was completed on 3 February 1967, and type training exercises, refresher training, and an operational readiness evaluation followed. On 18 April, Walker departed Pearl Harbor en route to Japan. From 4 to 17 May, the task group embarked on a transit of the Sea of Japan to demonstrate antisubmarine and antiair capabilities with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. The Soviet destroyer Besslednyy collides with Walker, 10 May 1967. On 10 May 1967, Walker relieved of screening duty for from the Soviet destroyer Besslednyy (022) which was attempting to close Hornet and harass the task group. A collision occurred between the two ships with minor damage sustained by both ships. The next day, Walker was again involved in screening duties with a Soviet ship. Late in the afternoon, a Soviet Krupnyy- class destroyer (\\"025\\") began to maneuver in an attempt to close Hornet; Walker effectively maneuvered the ship away. The Soviet destroyer than signaled a left turn. Walker signaled \\"do not cross ahead of me.\\" The Soviet ship came left and collided with Walker causing minor damage to both ships. Following exercises with the Republic of Korea Navy, Walker returned to Sasebo, Japan, and held a news conference and interviews on board concerning the Sea of Japan) incidents. The escort destroyer arrived at the Gulf of Tonkin on 25 May 1967. Walker served in several capacities: providing call fire, harassment, and interdiction fire for airborne spotters; acting as a rescue destroyer for Hornet, and ; and firing around-the-clock missions for numerous Army and Marine units. On the evening of 15 July, while providing gunfire support south of Cape Batangan, Walker received notification that a North Vietnamese naval trawler (459) carrying arms was expected to attempt a landing in the vicinity. Walker provided gunfire support for the attack on the trawler and suppressed enemy fire from the beach. The trawler was beached by the crew and abandoned with large quantities of arms, ammunition, and demolition equipment recovered by American forces. Walker joined Operation Beacon Guide as a naval gunfire support ship on 20 July and provided preparation fire for the amphibious and helicopter assault south of Hu·∫ø. After a brief tender availability at Taiwan, Walker returned to the Tonkin Gulf on 9 August and operated with (CVS-11) for a week prior to departure for Hong Kong. The escort destroyer rejoined Hornet, and the task group arrived at Hong Kong on 16 August, then transited to Sasebo, Japan, for repairs. Walker returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 7 September and was detached three days later to proceed to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea and conduct surveillance and gather intelligence data about the Chinese communist-held islands. Upon her return to the waters off Vietnam, Walker reported to for duty as her escort and spent the majority of September in various antisubmarine warfare exercises. On 27 September, Walker rejoined Hornet and rescued four survivors of an aircraft which had plunged into the water after losing an engine during launch. On 1 October 1967, the escort destroyer returned to antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises, then headed for upkeep at Yokosuka prior to preceding to the eastern Pacific. Walker arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 October and spent a month in post-deployment leave, type training, and a reserve cruise. Holiday leave commenced on 15 December.  1968  Walker spent the first seven months of 1968 in her home port conducting type training and preparing for a final western Pacific deployment. On 5 August, the escort destroyer got underway on the fourth western Pacific deployment since the beginning of the Vietnam War. She arrived at Subic Bay, Philippines, via Midway Atoll and Guam on 18 August, then proceeded to Vietnam. Planeguard duty with was Walker's first assignment. During her first night on station, she rescued a man overboard from America. On 13 November, Walker was relieved and proceeded to Subic Bay for upkeep. On 1 December, the escort destroyer arrived at the area north of V≈©ng T√†u for gunline duty which ended on 15 December. After a fuel stop at Subic Bay, Walker continued to Cebu, Philippines, arriving on 18 December as part of Operation Handclasp. The ship returned to Subic Bay on 22 December for a five- day tender availability alongside . On 29 December, Walker returned to Vietnam for a week of planeguard duty with Constellation (CVA-64).  1969  On 5 January 1969, the escort destroyer departed for visits to Hong Kong and Subic Bay. The ship joined three other destroyers and sailed for Australia and New Zealand. Walker and Taylor visited Wollongong and Melbourne, Australia; and Auckland, New Zealand, before arriving back at Pearl Harbor on 28 February. March was spent in leave; and, at the end of the month, Walker received word that she would be decommissioned. May was spent in port at Pearl Harbor; but, on 2 June, Walker got underway for San Diego, the designated decommissioning site. On 2 July 1969, Walker was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy List.  Fante (D 561)  The ship was sold to Italy, where she was renamed Fante (D 561). Fante was retired from Italian Navy service in 1977, and broken up for scrap. Honors Walker earned six battle stars for World War II engagements, two for Korean War, and three for Vietnam War service. See also See USS Walker for other ships of the same name.

A few are called ocean perch, sea perch or redfish, instead. Most of the Sebastes species live in the north Pacific, although two (S. capensis and S. oculatus) live in the South Pacific/Atlantic and four (S. fasciatus, S. mentella, S. norvegicus, and S. viviparus) live in the North Atlantic. The coast off Southern California is the area of highest rockfish diversity, with 56 species living in the Southern California Bight. The fossil record of rockfish goes back to the Miocene, with unequivocal whole body fossils and otoliths from California and Japan (although fossil otoliths from Belgium, \\"Sebastes\\" weileri, may push the record back as far as the early Oligocene). Rockfish are important sport and commercial fish, and many species have been overfished. As a result, seasons are tightly controlled in many areas. Sebastes species are sometimes fraudulently substituted for the more expensive northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus).  Ecology  Rockfish range from the intertidal zone to almost deep, usually living benthically on various substrates, often (as the name suggests) around rock outcrops. Some rockfish species are very long- lived, amongst the longest-living fish on earth, with several species known to surpass 100 years of age, and a maximum reported age of 205 years for S. aleutianus.  Ecotoxicology, radioecology  Like all carnivores, these fish can bioaccumulate some pollutants or radionuclides such as cesium. Highly radioactive rockfish have been caught in a port near Fukushima city, Japan, not far from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, nearly 2 years after the nuclear disaster (ex: 107000 Bq/kg (2013-02-12); 116000 Bq/kg (2013-02-13) and 132000Bq/kg (2013-02-13), respectively 1070, 1160, and 1320 times more than the maximum allowed by Japanese authorities (as updated on April 1, 2012)TEPCO (2013): Nuclide Analysis Results of Fish and Shellfish (The Ocean Area Within 20km Radius of Fukushima Daiichi NPS <1/13>.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WOPX-TV's offices are located on Grand National Drive in Orlando, and its transmitter is located on Nova Road east of St. Cloud. History=WAYK= WAYK signed on December 30, 1985 as an independent station. In 1988, Beach TV Partners signed on WAYQ at channel 26 as a simulcast of WAYK, giving them a signal in Daytona Beach. In early August 1990, owner Beach Television Partners based in Vero Beach filed for Chapter 11 reorganization over an inability to renegotiate a loan payment schedule. At the time, the station was only carried part-time on CableVision of Central Florida, Orlando's major cable system. WAYK was affiliated with the Beach TV investor, Harry Handley, who founded the Star Television Network. The network launched in September 1990 only to close down on . =WIRB= In 1992, the stations were both sold to Robert Rich, who added more paid programming to the channels. WAYK became WIRB, and WAYQ became WNTO. WIRB continued as a low budget independent station but also aired some NBC programs that were not cleared by WESH most notably Leeza (before it went into syndication) and California Dreams. WIRB would broadcast Florida Marlins baseball, Florida Panthers hockey, and Tampa Bay Lightning hockey to Central Florida from around 1993‚Äì1996. In 1996, Christian Television Network would buy WIRB (Paxson Communications, the predecessor to Ion Media Networks, took a LMA on the station at the same time) while Florida Media Broadcasters would buy WNTO (which would be later sold to Entravision and became Univision affiliate WVEN). WIRB then ran religious shows in the morning, infomercials in the afternoon and evening, and Christian praise and worship music on overnights in addition to the NBC programs not cleared by WESH. =WOPX= In January 1998, Paxson bought the station from CTN and renamed it WOPX (the -TV callsign would be added in 2012) and continued with the same format until August 31, 1998. At that point, WOPX took the Pax TV affiliation along with other stations owned by Paxson. Pax TV introduced family entertainment like dramas, movies, reality shows aimed at the family, game shows and other programming. Originally, Pax TV ran from noon to midnight, but has since reduced its schedule several times. At one point, it ran from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., and there are no original programs on the network, which has been renamed Ion Television. WOPX still fills the rest of its schedule with infomercials and religious shows. WOPX of recent has also carried Tampa Bay Rays baseball and Tampa Bay Lightning hockey from Ion's Tampa affiliate and produced by Fox Sports. On September 4, 2004, WOPX aired the NASCAR Xfinity Series (then Busch) race from California Speedway due to local NBC (who at that time broadcast NBS races) affiliate WESH's coverage of Hurricane Francis. Until the summer of 2005, WOPX had a JSA with WESH, which, during that time, WOPX aired a rebroadcast of WESH's 6 p.m. newscast at 7 p.m.. In July 2005, Paxson dissolved all relationships with other stations, mostly NBC stations‚Äîat that time, WESH's news repeats on WOPX ended. On December 15, 2014, Ion reached a deal to donate WOPX-TV's low-power repeater in Daytona Beach, WPXB-LD (channel 50), to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar network.

N. 4.85) were a people settled on the southern coast of the Crimea peninsula, inhabiting the Crimean Mountains in the 1st millennium BC and the narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Black Sea. According to the sources, Taurians lived in Crimean peninsula for the first time and never abandoned its borders. They gave their name to the peninsula, which was known in ancient times as Taurica, Taurida and Tauris.  Assimilation  Taurians intermixed with the Scythians starting from the end of 3rd century BC, and were mentioned as Tauroscythians and Scythotaurians in the works of ancient Greek writers. The Taurians underwent the rule of the Pontic Kingdom in the 2nd century BC. As a result of Roman occupations, Taurians were romanized in the first century AD. Later the Taurians were subsumed by the Alans and Goths, and existed till the 4th century. History In his Histories, Herodotus describes the Tauri as living \\"by plundering and war\\". They became famous for their worship of a virgin goddess, to whom they sacrificed shipwrecked travellers and waylaid Greeks.Hdt. 4.103 \\"the Tauri have the following customs: all ship-wrecked men, and any Greeks whom they capture in their sea-raids, they sacrifice to the Virgin goddess1 as I will describe: after the first rites of sacrifice, they strike the victim on the head with a club; according to some, they then place the head on a pole and throw the body off the cliff on which their temple stands; others agree as to the head, but say that the body is buried, not thrown off the cliff. The Tauri themselves say that this deity to whom they sacrifice is Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia. As for enemies whom they defeat, each cuts his enemy's head off and carries it away to his house, where he places it on a tall pole and stands it high above the dwelling, above the smoke-vent for the most part. These heads, they say, are set up to guard the whole house. The Tauri live by plundering and war.\\" (trans. Godley) He makes a point of them living in Scythia geographically without themselves being Scythians.4.99 \\"Beyond this place [Carcinitis on the Ister], the country fronting the same sea is hilly and projects into the Pontus; it is inhabited by the Tauric nation as far as what is called the Rough Peninsula; and this ends in the eastern sea. For the sea to the south and the sea to the east are two of the four boundary lines of Scythia, just as seas are boundaries of Attica; and the Tauri inhabit a part of Scythia like Attica, as though some other people, not Attic, were to inhabit the heights of Sunium from Thoricus to the town of Anaphlystus, if Sunium jutted farther out into the sea. I mean, so to speak, to compare small things with great. Such a land is the Tauric country. But those who have not sailed along that part of Attica may understand from this other analogy: it is as though in Calabria some other people, not Calabrian, were to live on the promontory within a line drawn from the harbor of Brundisium to Tarentum. I am speaking of these two countries, but there are many others of a similar kind that Tauris resembles.\\" (trans. A. D. Godley) In Geographica, Strabo refers to the Tauri as a Scythian tribe.Strabo. Geographica. 7. 4. 2. \\"... generally speaking, the Tauri, a Scythian tribe... The Greeks identified the Tauric goddess with Artemis Tauropolos or with Iphigeneia, daughter of Agamemnon. The Tauric custom of human sacrifice inspired the Greek legends of Iphigeneia and Orestes, recounted in Iphigeneia in Tauris by the playwright Euripides. The original greek title given by Euripides literally means Iphigeneia among the taurians. Such place as \\"Tauris\\" does not exist. According to Herodotus, the manner of their sacrifice was to beat the head with a club and remove the head; then they either buried the body or threw it off a cliff, and lastly nailed the head to a cross. Prisoners of war likewise had their heads removed, and the head was then put onto a tall pole and placed at their house \\"in order that the whole house may be under their protection\\". Although the Crimean coast eventually came to be dominated by Greek (and subsequently Roman) colonies, notably the one at Chersonesos, the Tauri remained a major threat to Greek power in the region. They engaged in piracy against ships on the Black Sea, mounting raids from their base at Symbolon (today's Balaklava). By the 2nd century BC they had become subject-allies of the Scythian king Scilurus. In the 4th century AD, the historian Ammianus Marcellinus, mentioned the names of the 3 tribes (Arichi, Sinchi, and Napaei) of the Taurians known for their \\"extraordinary severity\\". Taurians also played a major role in the development and settlement of the Kizil-Koban Culture (KKC) in the 8th-4th century BC. Osmolovsky, who conducted a research in the Krasnaya (Red) Cave in 1921, pointed out that the arrowheads, ceramics and necklaces found in the Cave were owned by the Taurians. There are several evidence that this culture belongs to the Tauris, such as: * Firstly, in the written sources of the earlier times than the 2nd century BC, there is no mention of any other society living in the Crimean foothills and mountains apart from the Taurians. * Secondly, many artifacts found in Taurians territory and cemeteries were also found in the Kizil-Koba sites.

Life and career Johnston was born and raised in Chicago. He attended Columbia College Chicago, where he studied acting and comedy alongside other future Mr. Show alumni such as Dino Stamatopoulos, Scott Adsit and Eric Hoffman. After graduating college, Johnston later joined the Chicago Second City's touring comedy for a number of years and also performed in stage shows at the Annoyance Theater in Chicago. Jay Johnston's contribution to Mr. Show were generally of the \\"evergreen\\" variety, dealing with more or less universal themes as opposed to the more political and socially satirical material that his fellow writers and performers contributed to the series. As such, Jay was responsible for many of the show's memorable sketches and characters. Johnston often incorporated physical comedy into the show, most notably in \\"The Story of Everest\\" sketch, which features Johnston performing six identical backwards pratfalls into furniture. Since the conclusion of Mr. Show, Johnston has made guest appearances in a number of television programs such as Arrested Development, Community, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Parks and Recreation, as well as appearing in films such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In 2006, Johnston regularly appeared as \\"The Boss\\" on FUEL TV's American Misfits, in the show's intro and outro sketch segments. The show is a half- hour mix of skateboarding and sketches, very much in the mold of the early 1990s skateboarding videos. Johnston starred on all three seasons of Comedy Central's The Sarah Silverman Program as \\"Officer Jay McPherson\\", the love interest of Sarah's sister Laura in the series. The series reunited Johnston with Mr. Show cast members Brian Posehn, Scott Aukerman, B. J. Porter, and Paul F. Tompkins. In 2011, Johnston appeared as a sketch regular in season two of the Comedy Central sketch comedy series Nick Swardson's Pretend Time. Johnston and fellow Mr. Show regulars Dino Stamatopoulos and Scott Adsit, were part of the creative team (voicing, writing, directing and producing) behind Adult Swim's stop-motion animation series Moral Orel, which ran from 2005 to 2008. In 2010, Johnston provided voices for Stamatopoulos' Adult Swim series, Mary Shelley's Frankenhole. Johnston currently has a recurring voice role as Jimmy Pesto, Sr. in the FOX animated series Bob's Burgers.

He was the opening announcer and TV anchor at the Live Aid concert in 1985, and is the only presenter to have fronted all three of the BBC's leading pop music programmes, The Old Grey Whistle Test and Top of the Pops on television and the Radio One Top 40 show. Early career Skinner grew up in Portsmouth where he attended Portsmouth Grammar School. He was a founder member of Portsmouth Hospital Broadcasting, which first went on air in April 1970. After studying newspaper journalism at Highbury Technical College. he began his career at the local paper The News. He then moved to the Erith Observer newspaper in Kent and at the same time appeared briefly on BBC Radio Medway, before joining the staff of BBC Radio Solent in October 1971 as a presenter of music programmes (including the weekly pop show Beat 'n Track) and as a newsreader. Radio 1 Skinner joined BBC Radio 1 in the autumn of 1973 as one of the original presenters of Newsbeat. He continued in this role until 1980, when he became a regular presenter of music programmes for Radio 1, taking over the Monday-Thursday evening show from Mike Read in the December. At the same time Skinner continued with Newsbeat as a studio producer and also worked as an in-vision continuity announcer for Thames Television. According to Skinner, during his time working on Newsbeat he broke the news of the death of John Lennon to Paul McCartney's household by phone in the early hours of 9 December 1980. In late 1981, Skinner became presenter of Radio 1's Rock On magazine show on Saturday afternoons and Roundtable on Friday evenings, on which he and guests would review the week's new releases. He continued with the programme until late 1985. In addition to Roundtable, from 1983 Skinner presented the Saturday Live show from 4 to 6:30pm alongside Andy Batten-Foster. On 30 September 1984, 17 years to the day after Radio 1 began, Skinner took over the Sunday afternoon Top 40 show, also broadcast on FM. That same day David Jensen, who had just left Radio 1, started presenting The Network Chart Show on commercial radio in competition. On BBC television, he presented Top of the Pops and The Old Grey Whistle Test, and also played two roles in the Band Aid and Live Aid phenomenon of the 1980s. Instead of publicising new Boomtown Rats release as planned, Bob Geldof announced the creation of the Band Aid project on Skinner's Radio 1 show in 1984. Then on 13 July 1985, Skinner made the opening announcement at Live Aid (\\"It's twelve noon in London ...\\") as the event got underway. He also fronted the first hours of BBC TV's Bafta Award-winning coverage. In 2018, Skinner's original Live Aid opening announcement was featured in the remarkable recreation of the concert in the Oscar Award winning Queen bio-pic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Capital London In the spring of 1986, Skinner left Radio 1 to join Capital Radio, and was replaced on the chart show by Bruno Brookes. At Capital, he presented on its FM Album Rock station CFM and hosted The Way It Is - Capital's equivalent of Radio 1's Newsbeat. Return to Radio 1 In October 1988, when Radio 1 - which had acquired its own FM transmitters - extended its hours, Skinner rejoined the station to host a midnight show to play an eclectic mix of album-orientated music. In late 1989, Skinner took over the Saturday afternoon Radio 1 show the 'Saturday Sequence' from Roger Scott following the latter's early death from cancer. In 1991 Skinner also took over the helming of Scott's series Classic Albums. In April 1990, he left the midnight show to be replaced by Bob Harris, but continued with the Saturday Sequence, where he remained until 1991, when Johnnie Walker took over. GLR From the turn of the 1990s, while still at Radio 1, Skinner also presented a daily show on BBC GLR, an eclectic mix of music, recorded and live, and live interviews from pop to politics. This continued until the end of December 1992. Virgin Radio On 1 January 1993, he joined the launch team at Virgin Radio, working as joint programme director, head of music and mid-morning presenter. On launch day 30 April 1993, he hosted the station's first programme. His weekday morning show ran from then until the autumn of 1996. Magic After a short spell at London's Liberty Radio as breakfast presenter alongside Carol McGiffin, in 1997 Skinner joined London's Melody FM, which later became Magic 105.4, presenting the mid-morning show for six years until September 2003. In August 2013 Skinner returned to Magic 105.4 to provide cover for holidaying presenters. Skinner also continued to provide cover in 2014. Virgin Radio Classic Rock In late 2003, Skinner was freelancing at the south-coast station Wave 105. Then in early 2004 he rejoined Virgin Radio on the London digital station Virgin Radio Classic Rock, where he hosted the mid-morning show, which was initially recorded, but broadcast live from mid-2005. During this period, he provided holiday cover on Virgin Radio. He left when live programming on Virgin Radio Classic Rock was abandoned in December 2005. Classic Gold/BBC Radio Berkshire After freelancing on the Classic Gold network, in April 2006 Skinner joined BBC Radio Berkshire to host the Saturday and Sunday mid-morning programmes. During this time he also covered for holidaying presenters. He left on 6 January 2008. Original 106 In January 2008, Skinner joined Original 106 as mid-morning presenter and remained in the slot until November 2008, when the station was rebranded as The Coast by its new owners Celador. He briefly moved to weekend afternoons before leaving the station in December 2008. Xfm/Radio X Skinner joined Xfm, now known as Radio X, in January 2009 to present the station's networked mid-morning show in London and Manchester - leaving at the end of August 2011. Absolute Radio 70s It was announced in an Absolute Radio press release on 18 October 2011 that Richard Skinner would be part of the launch of Absolute Radio 70s. He hosted the opening show for the station at 10am on 29 November. Personal life Skinner is married to Deborah. He has three children - Christopher, Kelly and Jamie.

(Photo taken under inactinic light.) A stepper is a device used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) that is similar in operation to a slide projector or a photographic enlarger. The term \\"stepper\\" is short for step-and-repeat camera. Steppers are an essential part of the complex process, called photolithography, that creates millions of microscopic circuit elements on the surface of chips of silicon. These chips form the heart of ICs such as computer processors, memory chips, and many other devices. The stepper emerged in the late 1970s but did not become widespread until the 1980s. This was because it was replacing an earlier technology, the aligner. Aligners imaged the entire surface of a wafer at the same time, producing many chips in a single operation. In contrast, the stepper imaged only one chip at a time, and was thus much slower to operate. The stepper eventually displaced the aligner when the relentless forces of Moore's Law demanded that smaller feature sizes be used. Because the stepper imaged only one chip at a time it offered higher resolution and was the first technology to the 1 micron limit. The addition of auto-alignment systems reduced the setup time needed to image multiple ICs, and by the late 1980s, the stepper had almost entirely replaced the aligner in the high-end market. The stepper was itself replaced by the step-and-scan systems which offered an additional order of magnitude resolution advance, which work by scanning only a small portion of the mask for an individual IC, and thus require much longer operation times than the original steppers. These became widespread during the 1990s and essentially universal by the 2000s. Today, step-and-scan systems are so widespread that they are often simply referred to as steppers. The stepper's role in photolithography Integrated circuits (ICs) are produced in a process known as photolithography. The process starts with a large highly purified cylindrical crystal of the semiconductor material known as a boule. Thin slices are cut off the boule to form disks, and then undergo initial processing and treatment to create a silicon wafer. Elements of the circuit to be created on the IC are reproduced in a pattern of transparent and opaque areas on the surface of a glass or plastic plate called a photomask or reticle. The wafer is coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist. The mask is positioned over the wafer and bright light, normally ultraviolet, is shone through the mask. Exposure to the light causes sections of the resist to either harden or soften, depending on the process. After exposure, the wafer is developed like photographic film, causing the photoresist to dissolve in certain areas according to the amount of light the areas received during exposure. These areas of photoresist and no photoresist reproduce the pattern on the reticle. The developed wafer is then exposed to solvents. The solvent etches away the silicon in the parts of the wafer that are no longer protected by the photoresist coating. Other chemicals are used to change the electrical characteristics of the silicon in the bare areas. The wafer is then cleaned, recoated with photoresist, then passed through the process again in a process that creates the circuit on the silicon, layer by layer. Once the entire process is complete, the wafer is sawn apart into individual chips, tested, and packaged for sale. =Aligners vs. steppers= Before steppers, wafers were exposed using mask aligners, which pattern the entire wafer at once. Masks for these systems would contain many individual ICs patterned across the mask. Between each step, the operator would use a microscope to align the wafer with the next mask to be applied. During the 1970s, aligners generally worked at a one-to-one magnification, which limited the amount of detail on the wafer to about whatever could be produced on the mask. As feature sizes shrank, following Moore's law, the construction of these complex multi-chip masks became very difficult. In 1975, GCA introduced the first step-and-scan camera, which simplified the process of making masks. In this system, a single parent mask, known as the \\"reticle\\", was produced at large scale so it could be mechanically robust. This was imaged through a photographic projector, shrinking the projected image 5 to 10 times. The mechanism imaged the reticle onto a photographic plate, moved the reticle to another position, and repeated this process. The result was a mask containing many precise images of the original reticle pattern. GCA continued development of the hardware as a direct-to-wafer system, eliminating the need to produce a mask from the reticle and instead using the reticle to expose the wafer directly. Because the reticle was at a much larger scale than the final image, the resolution could be improved, as this was formerly limited to the resolution of the mask itself. To pattern the entire wafer, the mask is repeatedly moved, or \\"stepped\\", across the front of the wafer. This requires the stepping mechanism to be incredibly accurate, demanding precise alignment. The alignment process is normally automated, eliminating the manual operation. As each exposure takes as long as the entire mask in an aligner, steppers are inherently slower to use than aligners, so aligners remain in use for roles where higher resolutions are not required. Steppers increased the possible resolution many times over that of the aligners, and were the first systems to allow features smaller than 1 micron. However, the relentless drive of Moore's law pushed the industry to the point where even the maximum magnifications possible in the projection system were not enough to continue shrinking the feature sizes. This led to the 1990 introduction of the step-and-scan systems, which combine a stepper system with a scanner that images only a portion of the mask at a time. Doing so allows much greater focussing over the tiny part of the mask, although it also makes the IC production process much slower. As of 2008, step-and-scan systems are the most widely used systems for high-end semiconductor device fabrication. Major subassemblies A typical stepper has the following subassemblies: wafer loader, wafer stage, wafer alignment system, reticle loader, reticle stage, reticle alignment system, reduction lens, and illumination system. Process programs for each layer printed on the wafer are executed by a control system centering on a computer that stores the process program, reads it, and communicates with the various subassemblies of the stepper in carrying out the program's instructions. The components of the stepper are contained in a sealed chamber that is maintained at a precise temperature to prevent distortions in the printed patterns that might be caused by expansion or contraction of the wafer due to temperature variations. The chamber also contains other systems that support the process, such as air conditioning, power supplies, control boards for the various electrical components, and others. Basic operation The silicon wafers are coated with photoresist, and placed in a cassette or \\"boat\\" that holds a number of wafers. This is then placed in a part of the stepper called the wafer loader, usually located at the lower front of the stepper. A robot in the wafer loader picks up one of the wafers from the cassette and loads it onto the wafer stage where it is aligned to enable another, finer alignment process that will occur later on. The pattern of the circuitry for each chip is contained in a pattern etched in chrome on the reticle, which is a plate of transparent quartz. A typical reticle used in steppers is 6 inches square and has a usable area of 104mm by 132mm. A variety of reticles, each appropriate for one stage in the process, are contained in a rack in the reticle loader, usually located at the upper front of the stepper. Before the wafer is exposed a reticle is loaded onto the reticle stage by a robot, where it is also very precisely aligned. Since the same reticle can be used to expose many wafers, it is loaded once before a series of wafers is exposed, and is realigned periodically. Once the wafer and reticle are in place and aligned, the wafer stage, which is moved very precisely in the X and Y directions (front to back and left to right) by worm screws or linear motors, carries the wafer so that the first of the many patterns (or \\"shots\\") to be exposed on it is located below the lens, directly under the reticle. Although the wafer is aligned after it is placed on the wafer stage, this alignment is not sufficient to ensure that the layer of circuitry to be printed onto the wafer exactly overlays previous layers already there. Therefore, each shot is aligned using special alignment marks that are located in the pattern for each final IC chip. Once this fine alignment is completed, the shot is exposed by light from the stepper's illumination system that passes through the reticle, through a reduction lens, and on to the surface of the wafer. A process program or \\"recipe\\" determines the length of the exposure, the reticle used, as well as other factors that affect the exposure. Each shot located in a grid pattern on the wafer and is exposed in turn as the wafer is stepped back and forth under the lens. When all shots on the wafer are exposed, the wafer is unloaded by the wafer loader robot, and another wafer takes its place on the stage. The exposed wafer is eventually moved to a developer where the photoresist on its surface is exposed to developing chemicals that wash away areas of the photoresist, based on whether or not they were exposed to the light passing through the reticle. The developed surface is then subjected to other processes of photolithography. Illumination and the challenges of improving resolution The greatest limitation on the ability to produce increasingly finer lines on the surface of the wafer has been the wavelength of the light used in the exposure system. As the required lines have become narrower and narrower, illumination sources producing light with progressively shorter wavelengths have been put into service in steppers and scanners. An alternative to conventional light based lithography is nanoimprint lithography. The ability of an exposure system, such as a stepper, to resolve narrow lines is limited by the wavelength of the light used for illumination, the ability of the lens to capture light (or actually orders of diffraction) coming at increasingly wider angles (called numerical aperture or N.A.), and various improvements in the process itself. This is expressed by the following equation: \\\\mathrm{CD}=k_1\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mathrm{NA}} \\\\mathrm{CD} is the critical dimension, or finest line resolvable, k_1 is a coefficient expressing process- related factors, \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the light, and \\\\mathrm{NA} is the numerical aperture. Decreasing the wavelength of the light in the illumination system increases the resolving power of the stepper. Twenty years ago, the ultraviolet \\"g-line\\" (436 nm) of the mercury spectrum was used to create lines in the 750 nm range in steppers that employed mercury lamps as their illumination source. Several years later systems employing the \\"i-line\\" (365 nm) from mercury lamps were introduced to create lines as low as 350 nm. As the desired line widths approached and eventually became narrower than the wavelength of the light used to create them, a variety of resolution enhancement techniques were developed to make this possible, such as phase shifting reticles and various techniques for manipulating the angles of the exposure light in order to maximize the resolving power of the lens. Off-axis illumination as a resolution enabler. Eventually however, the desired line widths became narrower than what was possible using mercury lamps, and near the middle of the 2000s, the semiconductor industry moved towards steppers that employed krypton-fluoride (KrF) excimer lasers producing 248 nm light. Such systems are currently being used to produce lines in the 110 nm range. Lines as low as 32 nm are being resolved by production-capable steppers using argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers that emit light with a wavelength of 193 nm. Although fluoride (F2) lasers are available that produce 157 nm light, they are not practical because of their low power and because they quickly degrade photoresist and other materials used in the stepper. Optimum illumination dependence on pattern. The optimum illumination for a given pattern depends on the pattern. For an arbitrary 2D pattern, conventional illumination is sufficient for k_1>0.5. However, for k_1<0.5, the illumination is restricted per pattern. Since practical light sources with wavelengths narrower than these lasers have not been available, manufacturers have sought to improve resolution by reducing the process coefficient k_1. This is done by further improving techniques for manipulating the light as it passes through the illumination system and the reticle, as well as improving techniques for processing the wafer before and after exposure. Manufacturers have also introduced ever larger and more expensive lenses as a means of increasing the numerical aperture. However, these techniques are approaching their practical limit, and line widths in the 45 nm range appear to be near the best that can be achieved with conventional design. Restricted pupil locations. As the resolution limit is approached, specific locations of the pupil, corresponding to specific illumination angles for specific patterns (with corresponding colors), are forbidden for other patterns. For example, diagonal and horizontal+vertical pitches are mutually exclusive. Ultimately, other sources of illumination will have to be put to use, such as electron beams, x-rays or similar sources of electromagnetic energy with wavelengths much shorter than visible light. However, in order to delay as long as possible the vast expense and difficulty of adopting a whole new type of illumination technology, manufacturers have turned to a technique, previously used in microscopes, for increasing the numerical aperture of the lens by allowing the light to pass through water instead of air. This method, called immersion lithography, is the current cutting edge of practical production technology. It works because numerical aperture is a function of the maximum angle of light that can enter the lens and the refractive index of the medium through which the light passes. When water is employed as the medium, it greatly increases numerical aperture, since it has a refractive index of 1.44 at 193 nm, while air has an index of 1. Current production machines employing this technology are capable of resolving lines in the 32 nm range, and may eventually be able to achieve lines of 30 nm.  Scanners  Modern scanners are steppers that increase the length of the area exposed in each shot (the exposure field) by moving the reticle stage and wafer stage in opposite directions to each other during the exposure. Instead of exposing the entire field at once, the exposure is made through an \\"exposure slit\\" that is as wide as the exposure field, but only a fraction of its length (such as a 9x25 mm slit for a 35x25 mm field). The image from the exposure slit is scanned across the exposure area. {  Animation showing how a scanner exposes sections of a wafer } There are several benefits to this technique. The field can be exposed with a lesser reduction of size from the reticle to the wafer (such as 4x reduction on a scanner, compared with 5x reduction on a stepper), while allowing a field size much larger than that which can be exposed with a typical stepper. Also the optical properties of the projection lens can be optimized in the area through which the image of the projection slit passes, while optical aberrations can be ignored outside of this area, because they will not affect the exposed area on the wafer. Successful scanning requires extremely precise synchronization between the moving reticle and wafer stages during the exposure. Accomplishing this presents many technological challenges.

Background The Communist Party of China (CPC)'s Guangdong Provincial Committee had been preparing for an uprising in Guangzhou since September 1927. It originally planned to use a large group of communist-leaning soldiers who were heading into Guangdong after taking part in the failed Nanchang uprising. According to these plans, local workers and peasants were supposed to act as auxiliaries, while the soldiers would bear the brunt of the fighting. The troops from Nanchang were defeated at Shantou in early October, however, precluding any attempt to utilise them in the Guangzhou Uprising. CPC party head Qu Qiubai consequently decided that the communists had to persuade soldiers who were stationed in Guangdong to join their cause. Upon receiving orders from Joseph Stalin to launch the planned uprising in mid-December, over the course of November, a final plan for rebellion was worked out by the central party leadership and Guangdong secretary Zhang Tailei in Shanghai. Originally, the Chinese communist leadership opposed the plans, and made representations to the Soviet government to the effect that they had no chance at winning control of Guangzhou, but ultimately gave in to Soviet pressure. The CPC thought that fighting between the Kuomintang-aligned warlords Zhang Fakui and Li Jishen was imminent in Guangdong, potentially providing them with an opportunity to exploit the ensuing chaos by launching multiple simultaneous rebellions to seize power in the province. Peasant insurgents were supposed to throw the countryside into chaos, while workers should take over the county seats, and a general strike would paralyze Guangzhou. A separate communist faction was to capture Hainan island, and an army from the Hailufeng Soviet attack Huizhou, and then advance against Guangzhou. In the end, however, the communists in Guangzhou did not follow this plan. The conflict between Zhang Fakui and Li Jishen already broke out on 27 November, with the former capturing Guangzhou from the latter in surprise attack. Thereafter, however, Zhang moved most of his troops out of the city to resist Li's counter-attacks. When the Guangdong Provincial Committee thus converged on 27 November, it concluded that the time was ideal for an insurrection in Guangzhou itself. It remains strongly disputed who exactly was responsible for the further course of events. The communists in Guangdong later claimed that their insurrection was based on the plans discussed with the party leadership, though historian Hsiao Tso-Liang argued that the former still acted completely autonomous and without the knowledge of the latter. Other historians consider this view too extreme, and have put forth evidence which suggests that the CPC's central leadership was informed about the ongoing events in Guangdong. Furthermore, it has been argued that Comintern agents who were present in the province might have decisively influenced the Guangdong Provincial Committee in its decisions about when and how to launch a rebellion. Regardless of who was responsible for the decision, the Guangdong Committee began to prepare its uprising in earnest from 27 November. A Revolutionary Military Council was appointed with Ye Ting as commander-in-chief and Zhang Tailei as chairman. Sometime in early December, Comintern agent Heinz Neumann arrived in Guangdong, joining the local communists. According to CPC leader Zhang Guotao, Neumann came to wield great influence on the committee and took a leading role in the rebellion; others believe that he was just a messenger for Stalin. The core fighting force of the rebellion consisted of an ad-hoc \\"Red Guard\\" formed by 2,000 armed workers, and a communist-infiltrated cadet regiment of 1,200 soldiers. History On 11 December 1927, the political leadership of the CPC ordered about 20,000 communist-leaning soldiers and armed workers to organize a \\"Red Guard\\" and take over Guangzhou. The uprising occurred despite the strong objections of communist military commanders such as Ye Ting, Ye Jianying and Xu Xiangqian, as the communists were badly armed - just 2,000 of the insurgents had rifles. Nevertheless, rebel forces captured most of the city within hours using the element of surprise, despite a huge numerical and technical advantage held by government troops. The communist leaders officially renamed the city's political structure the \\"Soviet of Workers, Soldiers and Peasant Deputies\\" or \\"Guangzhou Soviet\\". After this initial success for the communists, however, the 15,000 National Revolutionary Army (NRA) troops in the area moved into the city and started to push back the insurgents. After five more NRA divisions arrived in Guangzhou, the uprising was quickly crushed. The insurgents suffered heavy casualties, while the survivors had to flee the city or go into hiding. The Comintern, especially Neumann, were later blamed for insisting that the communists had to hold onto Guangzhou at all cost. Zhang Tailei, the leading Red Guard organizer, was killed in an ambush as he returned from a meeting. The takeover dissolved by the early morning of December 13, 1927. In the resulting purges, many young communists were executed and the Guangzhou Soviet became known as the \\"Canton Commune\\", \\"Guangzhou Commune\\" or \\"Paris Commune of the East\\"; it lasted only a short time at the cost of more than 5,700 communists dead and an equal number missing. Around 8 p.m. on 13 December, the Soviet consulate in Guangzhou was surrounded and all its personnel were arrested. In the accident the consulate diplomats Ukolov, Ivanov and others were killed. Ye Ting, the military commander, was scapegoated, purged and blamed for the failure, despite the fact that the obvious disadvantages of the communist force was the main cause of the defeat, as Ye Ting and other military commanders had correctly pointed out. Enraged by his unjustified treatment, Ye Ting left China and went into exile in Europe, not returning until nearly a decade later. Despite being the third failed uprising of 1927, and reducing the morale of the communists, it encouraged further uprisings across China.

Near the end of his first term, he was also appointed as the acting and later permanent Minister of National Defence for Air (1945.03.08 - 1946.12.11). He served as Secretary of State (1948.11.15 - 1949.03.31) and (1946.12.12 - 1948.11.14). He was Minister for Mines and Resources (1949.04.01 - 1950.01.17). Following his re-election with 40.2% of the vote (in a three-way, four-party race), he continued as Minister of National Defence for Air (1945.01.11 - 1945.03.07). He was made the Secretary of State for Canada (1948.11.15 - 1949.03.31) and (1946.12.12 - 1948.11.14). Just before the end of his second term, he was moved to the post of Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Canada) (1949.04.01 - 1950.01.17). He continued in this post after he was re-elected in 1949 (with 43.5% of the vote). He resigned from both cabinet and parliament upon his appointment as Puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario. He died in 1974. Family Gibson was the son of Major General Sir John Morison Gibson, former Attorney General of Ontario. His son, Colin D.

Generally, taste aversion is developed after ingestion of food that causes nausea, sickness, or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an adaptive trait or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. It is an example of operant conditioning, not Pavlovian. Studies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by Dr. John Garcia, leading to it sometimes being called the Garcia effect. Conditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs when sickness is merely coincidental to, and not caused by, the substance consumed. For example, a person who becomes very sick after consuming vodka-and-orange-juice cocktails may then become averse to the taste of orange juice, even though the sickness was caused by the over-consumption of alcohol. Under these circumstances, conditioned taste aversion is sometimes known as the \\"Sauce-Bearnaise Syndrome\\", a term coined by Seligman and Hager.Seligman, M. E. P. & Hager, J. L. (1972, August). Biological boundaries of learning. The sauce-bearnaise syndrome. Psychology Today, V6, 59-61, 84-87.  Garcia's study  While studying the effects of radiation on various behaviors in the mid to late 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively. This finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion. Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa.  Notes  Taste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop--that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may hope to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited. Also, taste aversion generally only requires one trial. The experiments of Ivan Pavlov required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening. If the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called latent inhibition. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats. Aversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes. Common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) do not learn taste aversions despite being closely related to other species of bats that do. The diet of common vampire bats only consists of vertebrate blood and therefore it is hypothesized that the development of a taste aversion to their only food source would not be advantageous for these animals.  In humans  Taste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until extinction occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to cause the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats sushi for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcoholic beverages because of vomiting during intoxication. Taste aversion is a common problem with chemotherapy patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food.  Applications  Taste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators. In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits. When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey.  Stimulus generalization  Stimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating tangerines and clementines because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous. Stimulus generalization operates in most facets of animal and human life far beyond food tastes and aversion. Trauma and negative reinforcement of all kinds create aversion of other negative reaction to generalizations from the adverse event or events. And like taste aversion, the generalization may or not be conscious. Stimulus generalization is a factor in most \\"superstitious behavior\\", racism and prejudice of all kinds.  Compared with taste avoidance Although the terms \\"taste avoidance\\" and \\"taste aversion\\" are often used interchangeably, studies with rats indicate they are not necessarily synonymous. \\"Aversion\\" is defined as \\"a strong dislike or disinclination\\"\\"Aversion\\". Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013. and \\"avoidance\\" is defined as \\"stopping oneself from doing\\".\\"Avoid\\". Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013. The difference is that in avoidance, the organism is controlling its behavioural responses. Taste avoidance and taste aversion can at times go hand in hand, but they cannot be looked at or be defined the same way. Studies on rats to determine how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a Pavlovian conditioned response as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste aversion. This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting within a few hours of eating the steak. Although the human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating the steak, the conditioned response in the brain associates the steak with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to the steak. When examining taste avoidance, however, the rat may avoid a food yet still enjoy it and choose it over others. In further tests, the rats were tested with another sucrose solution but this time it was paired with a drug that gave positive, euphoric effects, such as amphetamine, cocaine, and morphine. The rats showed positive reactions to the drugs. However, rats react to any change in physiological state as a sign of danger and avoided approaching these solutions. When one of these euphoric solutions was placed next to another solution that had a learned taste aversion, the rat would choose the substance that it had a taste avoidance towards. Scientists theorize that in terms of evolution, because rats are unable to vomit and immediately purge toxins, rats have developed a strong \\"first line of defense\\", which is their sense of taste and smell. This further shows the importance of taste and the correlation between taste and any change in physiological state, whether it be good or bad. Because rats rely upon taste and pairing it with a reaction rather than relying on later responses that involve the gastrointestinal tract, taste avoidance is just as prevalent as taste aversion, though the two don't necessarily go hand in hand.

Lurich was also the trainer of Estonian wrestlers and weightlifters Georg Hackenschmidt and Aleksander Aberg. Early life Born Georg Luri on 22 April 1876 in the village of V√§ike-Maarja in Viru County, Russian Empire (now L√§√§ne-Viru County, Estonia), he was a son of a shopkeeper named J√ºri Luri. Although ethnically Estonian, his family later altered their surname to Lurich after changing religious congregations from a Lutheran Estonian congregation to a predominantly ethnic Baltic German congregation. Lurich's family believed members of the German congregation had better possibilities to educate their children in town schools.S.C. Lurich 02 E.V. Berlin Although they changed their surname, Georg suffered physical and mental persecution from mostly Baltic German fellow schoolmates. This situation was the main reason why he began training his body. He studied information about how to train from German-language books.Lurich by Paavo Kivine (2011) Tallinn: Olympia Lurich began participating in sporting activities at an early age. After graduating from Peter's Modern School in Tallinn (today, Tallinn Secondary School of Science) in 1894, he travelled to St. Petersburg, Russia where he practised weightlifting and wrestling under the supervision of the athletics coach Dr. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Krajewski. Lurich performed in St. Petersburg's summer gardens, competed with local wrestlers and made various lifting demonstrations together with fellow strongman Gustav Boesberg. His popularity convinced him to follow a career in as a professional athlete.S.C. Lurich 02 E.V. Berlin Lurich became the first Estonian to set world weightlifting records. The Estonian public eagerly attended his matches and Lurich's popularity in his homeland soared. From 1897 to 1898 Lurich toured Estonia and his successes helped popularize athletics in Estonia and dozens of athletic clubs were established. In 1896, Lurich befriended an 18-year-old fellow countryman by the name of Georg Hackenschmidt and began to train the young man. Hackenschmidt would later go on to create a name for himself in weightlifting and wrestling. Georg Lurich in a circa 1900‚Äì1905 postcard posed to show his physique. Travel abroad and death Prior to World War I, Lurich, along with friend and fellow Estonian wrestler Aleksander Aberg travelled to the United States to perform for American audiences. Lurich performed in free-style wrestling matches in the United States between 1913 and 1917. Lurich wrestled American world wrestling champion and title holder Frank Gotch in Kansas City in 1913, but lost what would be Gotch's final match.http://www.wrestlingsbest.com/collectibles/wrestuffcards017.htmlGotch Beats Lurich Easily In Only Bout During Year, Chicago Daily Tribune, Dec 28, 1913Article by Claude Johnson, sports editor of the Kansas City Star newspaper, April 2, 1913 After returning home via Japan, China and Russia in 1917 they arrived in Estonia in the autumn. They participated in a wrestling tournament in the capital city of Tallinn that remained unfinished due to the approach of German troops. The two athletes went to Saint Petersburg and on to southern Russia. The Russian Civil War meant an end to work in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Conditions seemed better in the southern region, which was controlled by the White Army. However, the war spread and the men had to flee further inside Russia. They became stranded in a far corner of southern Russia in a village named Armavir. Their initial aim was to leave Russia across the Black Sea by boat. Things took a dramatic turn in Armavir at the beginning of 1920. The fighting reached them, the town changed hands several times, many civilians perished, and there were many funerals. A warm winter brought about an epidemic of typhoid fever. Due to the war, medical aid was difficult to obtain. Lurich fell ill first and died on 20 January 1920. Aberg had also become infected with typhus, but managed to defeat the illness. However, he rushed his recovery, caught pneumonia, and died on 15 February 1920. The wrestlers were buried in one grave in the Armavir German cemetery. Legacy Following Georg Lurich's death on 20 January 1920 at the age of 43, many Estonians began embellishing his accomplishments with such voracity that Lurich's legend began taking on an almost mythological light. Folk tales abounded in rural Estonia and continue to years after Lurich's death. The following excerpt is an example of a Georg Lurich folk tale that has become popular amongst residents of V√§ike-Maarja, Estonia and was transcribed by Estonian author Kalle Voolaid: > \\"One hot and sunny summer day Lurich had been sitting on a hill slope in > V√§ike-Maarja and when the heat was becoming too much for him, he ran down > into the valley to freshen himself up with cool spring water.

It was established by a Hakka Chinese named in 1777, until it was ended by Dutch occupation in 1884. It was one of many tributary states of Qing China. The Lanfang Republic was one of the earliest modern republics in the world.  Arrival of the Chinese  The sultans of Western Borneo imported Chinese laborers in the 18th century to work in gold or tin mines. A number of mining companies (kongsi) enjoyed some political autonomy, but Lanfang is the best known thanks to a history written by Yap Siong-yoen, the son-in-law of the last kapitan of the Lanfang kongsi, which was translated into Dutch in 1885..Lindsey'& Pausacker & Coppel &Institute; of Southeast Asian Studies & Monash Asia Institute 2005, p. 105.ed.

None of the other Chinese mining settlements in western Kalimantan left written accounts.Heidhues 2001:169  Rule of Low Lan Pak  The founding father of the Lanfang Republic was Low Lan Pak, who hailed from Meizhou in Guangdong Province. Chinese settlers have long lived in Borneo island, with most engaging in trading and mining. They formed their own companies, among which was the Southern Company headed by Low. As Dutch imperialism encroached upon modern-day Indonesia, Low established the Lanfang Republic in 1777 (with its capital in East Wanjin) to protect the Chinese settlers from Dutch oppression.Gernet 1996, p. 489.YUNOS 2011. \\"The Eurozone as a Lan Fang Republic\\" 2012Zheng 1982, p. 40.Wang 1994, p. 87.\\"The Sarawak Museum Journal, Volume 19\\" 1971, p. 119. The settlers subsequently elected Low as their inaugural president. Low implemented many democratic principles, including the idea that all matters of state must involve the consultation of the republic's citizenry. He also created a comprehensive set of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies. The Republic did not have a standing military, but had a defense ministry that administered a national militia based on conscription. During peacetime, the populace mostly engaged in farming, production, trading, and mining. Lanfang's administrative divisions included three tiers (province, prefecture, and county) with the people electing leaders for all levels. Lanfang was allied with Sultan Abdurrahman of the Pontianak Sultanate.\\"The Sarawak Museum Journal\\" 1959, p. 671.Heidhues 2003, p. 65.Heidhues 2003, p. 103.Luo & Luo 1941,ÁæÖ 1961, Although Low discarded the ancient institutions of monarchism and dynastic succession, he continued to adhere to many Chinese traditions. For example, he established the founding year of the republic as the first year of the calendar. Moreover, he submitted a report to the Chinese emperor notifying him about the Republic's founding and paid tribute to the Chinese Qing Empire. Low served as head of state until his death in 1795. Afterwards, Lanfang citizens elected Jiang Wubo () as their next president. Lanfang citizens elected a total of twelve leaders, who helped improve agricultural techniques, expand mine production, develop cultural education, and organize military training. These measures allowed Lanfang to increase its wealth and power, which encouraged the non-Chinese indigenous population to pledge their allegiances to Lanfang.  Dutch conquest  In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese Qing Empire weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. Thus, Lanfang Republic's vigorous development suffered from the eventual expansion of the Dutch. The Republic's citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Lin Ah Sin was the last leader of Lanfang.Irwin 1955, p. 173. Many of Lanfang's citizens and their descendants made their way to Sumatra or Singapore. The three campaigns waged by the Dutch East Indies Army against the Chinese kongsi, called the Kongsi Wars, were: * Expedition to the West Coast of Borneo (1822‚Äì24) * Expedition against the Chinese in Montrado (1850‚Äì54) * Chinese uprising in Mandor, Borneo (1884‚Äì85) This last one resulted in the subjugation of the Chinese and the loss of autonomy. Wary of Qing intervention, the Dutch did not openly annex the Lanfang Republic, and created another puppet regime. It was not until 1912, when the Qing Dynasty collapsed, that the Dutch proclaimed their occupation.  References = Citations  Sources =            * .

Plot Road to Sunday revolves around Blake Doogan, who inherits a pro football team after his father is killed in a suspicious explosion while in Jamaica. Later, Blake learns that his father borrowed large sums of money from a Jamaican kingpin to purchase the professional football team the Los Angeles Show, and Doogan's father's debt is now his debt. =Gameplay= The gameplay follows the Blake, his friend/sidekick Harry and seven football players as they put it all on the line in order to get enough money to pay off the kingpin and win the championship. The on-the-field football experience is best characterized as mission-based football, done through the introduction of a new gameplay experience, Position Specific Gameplay (PSG). Players not only compete on the gridiron, but also gain exposure to an underworld of questionable characters, gambling, and an underground fighting league ran by the corrupt Jamaican kingpin. These off-field exploitations will drive the storyline as well as increase players‚Äô abilities to perform in future missions and impact the outcome of future football games.

It is part of the Ortsbezirk Innenstadt I. The Altstadt is located on the northern Main river bank. It is completely surrounded by the Innenstadt district, Frankfurt's present-day city centre. On the opposite side of the Main is the district of Sachsenhausen. The historic old town of Frankfurt was one of the largest half-timbered towns in Germany until the extensive destruction in the Second World War with its around 1250 half-timbered houses, most of which date from the Middle Ages. It was one of the most important tourist attractions for Germany. The historic old town was largely destroyed by the air raids on Frankfurt am Main in 1944. The streets and the entire district are predominantly characterized by quickly and easily erected buildings from the 1950s and 60s. However, several striking buildings and some important city squares have been restored or reconstructed, especially around the main square, the R√∂merberg . Under the name of the Dom-R√∂mer project, a new old town district was built between 2012 and 2018 between the imperial cathedral and the R√∂mer town hall, following a decision by the city council in 2007. The former streets and squares have been restored, especially the historical coronation route of German emperors, the street Alter Markt, as well as the old chicken market and a few adjoining streets. Altogether 35 houses were built according to a strict design statute, including 15 as creative replicas designated reconstructions of destroyed buildings and 20 newly designed buildings. General information Justice Fountain on the main square in Frankfurt Altstadt, 2015 =Surface and Population= The Altstadt is the smallest district of Frankfurt, covering less than half a square kilometre. The area is completely built-up with the only open spaces being accounted for by the Main and the river bank, the streets, squares and backyards. The construction descends predominantly from the reconstruction phase of the post-war era, aside from which there are numerous historical buildings partly reconstructed after their destruction in the Second World War. Approximately 3,400 people reside in the Altstadt of which an estimated 32% are of foreign origin. This is above the ratio of the entire town, but far under that of the other town quarters. The adjacent Neustadt, for example, is home to 44% non-German inhabitants. Museums and theatres dominate the western part of Altstadt and service jobs are a major part of the economy, especially along Wei√üfrauenstra√üe and Berliner Stra√üe. The centre of Altstadt is a hot spot for the city's tourism industry, with tours around the most meaningful sights such as Paulskirche, R√∂mer, and the Frankfurt Cathedral, as well as being the seat of the city's administrative branch. In the north of the district the retail industry is well represented, particularly in Neue Kr√§me and T√∂ngesgasse. Residential flats are found in the east in an area which also contains most of Frankfurt's art trade (Braubachstra√üe and Fahrgasse). =Economy= By far the largest employer in the old part of the city is the city's administration. Even today the Altstadt is the political centre of the city. The city council, magistrates and a considerable part of the city departments are located in R√∂mer square, either in the town hall itself or in the surrounding properties. In the past years, two other important facilities abandoned the Altstadt and the city as a whole: the German Federal Court of Auditors of Berliner Stra√üe which was relocated to Bonn, and the headquarters of Degussa from Wei√üfrauenstra√üe which moved to D√ºsseldorf. While the monument-listed building of the German Federal Court of Auditors is currently being redeveloped, the former Degussa building had been torn down, and the area has been redeveloped into flats and offices. Other important factors of the economy are the retail and tourist industries. Although there were still numerous small industrial businesses in the narrow lanes up until the Second World War, the retail sector now outweighs all other types of business. Particularly in Neue Kr√§me and T√∂ngesgasse many niche eateries can be found. In Berliner Stra√üe there a numerous shops specialised on Asian tourists who come to the city for extensive shopping trips. The Fahrgasse and the quarter around the Weckmarkt at the cathedral form the traditional centre for antique dealers in Frankfurt. =Traffic= The Altstadt is remarkably open because of its attachment to the suburban traffic network. The underground station \\"Dom/R√∂mer\\", opened in 1974, connected the historical core of the city to the Underground lines 4 and 5. The building of the track and the station in the years 1968‚Äì74 represented a special technical challenge. The underground junction of Willy-Brandt-Platz connects parts of the Altstadt, the rapid- transit system of Hauptwache and Konstablerwache to the north. Tram lines 11 and 12 operate along the central thoroughfare of Bethmannstrasse- Braubachstrasse-Battonnstrasse. At the start of the 20th century, two tram lines were laid through Altstadt, the first‚Äîthe so-called Dienstm√§dchenlinie (Handmaid's line)‚Äîfrom the Zeil past the Trierischen Hof (hotel) in the direction of the cathedral, the other along the newly laid Brauchbachstrasse in an east to west direction. While the Dienstm√§dchen line was never successful and had been shut down after the First World War, the east-west line remained and is now known as the Altstadtstrecke. In 1986 its redundant status was brought to an end due to the intervention of the district president in Darmstadt. In the meantime the Altstadtstrecke gained a firm place in local public passenger transport, especially with the Ebbelwei-express, which serves an exclusive tourist route. Three bridges lead out of the Altstadt over the Main; Alte Br√ºcke, Eiserner Steg and Untermainbr√ºcke. The Mainkai (Main quay), as the name suggests, stands on the oldest harbour in the city. Ships are still moored there today; however, these only serve tourists along the Main and the Rhine. Ships transporting goods are instead found, as in the city's early days, in the main harbours of Frankfurt.

Accordingly, the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt was only created under the son of the legendary founder, Ludwig the Pious, between 815 and 822. Wall ring around the core settlement on the Saturday mountain. (chromolithography by Friedrich August Ravenstein from 1862 with overlay according to archaeological findings) According to the current state of research, the core settlement was to be located on the Samstagsberg. Archaeological findings on the R√∂merberg, and most recently in the area of the Old Nikolaikirche, showed slight remains of a wall to be considered Carolingian, which would presumably surround the settlement on the Samstagsberg and, in a continued process, would also satisfactorily explain the striking rounding of the plots on the former Goldhutgasse. If one follows this assumption, the wall in the south was roughly limited by the course of the later Bendergasse, the northern and western extent can only be guessed at. Overall, however, there is a typical, ring-like fortification, the former row of buildings in the eastern part until the destruction of the Second World War was reflected by the parcels within their former borders. In the 9th century the Palatinate Franconofurd developed into one of the political centres of the eastern Franconian empire. Around the year 1000, the old town area was fortified under the Ottonian dynasty with a wider wall ring. It is unclear whether the core settlement had already expanded beyond the Carolingian wall at this time. Recent publications cautiously point out that at the earliest from the middle of the 10th century there was a very long transition from the post house to the half-timbered building with stone foundations, the scanty findings actually point to a slow expansion of the city limits at that time. Plan of the old town in 1628 by Matth√§us Merian : The irregularly-shaped street grid of the Dom-R√∂mer area opposite the rest of the old town is just as recognizable as the surrounding stevedore wall. (copper engraving) After the Carolingian Palatinate probably ended with a fire between 1017 and 1027 and the rulers of the Salians showed little interest in the city, the settlement activity only expanded again significantly with the active support of the Staufer in the 12th century. King Conrad III had a royal castle built on the Main in the middle of the 12th century with the Saalhof, which is still preserved in parts from this period . A little later, the urban area was enclosed with a wall named after the Swabian noble family , the course of which is still clearly visible in the shape of the city due to small remains above ground. Until the destruction of the Second World War, the street map was still recognisable from this period. This is clear from an impression of the street network from the early 14th century which shows that the Altstadt had already taken the form it would take for centuries. Most of the church and monastery foundations and the construction of the most important public buildings, most recently the town hall through reconstruction in 1405, fell into this first political and economic heyday through the acquisition of numerous imperial privileges. =The emergence of the Altstadt in the Middle Ages= Southern part of the Altstadt in a woodcarving, 1492 The Altstadt is on the right bank of the Main on the outer edge of a soft bend in the river. Here was the ford which gave the city its name. In the place of today's cathedral was a raised, flood proof plateau, the so-called Dominsel (cathedral island). At the time it was protected in the north by a branch of the main, the Brauchbach. This island represents the historic origin of the city and was presumably settled in the Neolithic era. Archaeological excavations in the 1950s and 1990s brought to light the remainders of a Roman military camp, an Alamanni property yard and a Merovingian king's court. Legends of the city's founding name Karl the Great as the city's founder, which corresponds to the oldest known documents (Frankfurt council, 794), but contradicts the archaeological findings. The area of the city initially grew out west around the start of the 2nd millennium (around the area west of today's R√∂merberg). One of the oldest city walls, the Staufenmauer, was erected connecting the area of these two expansions and equated to today's Altstadt. The adjacent district of the Innenstadt equated to the historic Neustadt, an expansion in 1333. On the border between the two was where the Jewish ghetto of the Judengasse was established. =The Altstadt in the Medieval Period= View of the Cathedral from Paulskirche, 1866 (Photography by C. F. Mylius) Salmenstein's house in the Frankfurt city fortifications , demolished in 1810 (depiction from 1886), model for the town hall tower \\"Kleiner Cohn\\" Over the course of the centuries, the population of the city always continued to increase, whereby the population density of the Altstadt continuously increased. The buildings finally had up to five full storeys and (due to the usual, very steep roofs) several attics. Each floor protruded outwards in excess of the one beneath it so the inhabitants of the highest floors could reach out and touch the hand of the person living on the other side of the alley. The old town began to display a clear structure with three north-south axis identifiable: in the west the Kornmarkt ran between Bockenheimer Gate (to the church later erected and named Katharinenpforte) and Leonhardstor (tower) next to Leonhardskirche (church) on the Main. In the middle of the district Neue Kr√§me connected the two largest squares of the Altstadt, Liebfrauenberg to R√∂merberg and further towards the south lying Fahrtor on the bank of the Main and the harbour there. The Fahrgasse ran east of the cathedral from Bornheimer Gate near today's Konstablerwache to the Main bridge. It was one of the most busy streets for Frankfurt traffic in the 20th century. Bendergasse from the east, a typical alley in the inner city of Frankfurt's old town, around 1904 The majority of Frankfurt's inhabitants lived in the densely populated Altstadt, while the Neustadt remained characteristically suburban until far into the 18th century with loose land development and agriculture featuring prominently in contrast with Altstadt. The city in general was divided into fourteen parts after the Fettmilch Rising of 1614. Seven of these formed the relatively small Altstadt, five belonged to the Neustadt (which made it three times bigger than the Altstadt) and two for Sachsenhausen. Each area placed a militarily organised citizen's resistance under the command of a civilian captain, which the only democratically elected department in the otherwise corporate composed imperial city. Substantial changes to the cityscape only occurred after a large fire in 1719 when 430 houses burnt down in the north east Altstadt. In order to prevent such disasters in the future the council intensified construction specifications in 1720. Between 1740 and 1800 around 3,000 houses were either adapted or built anew. The number and width of overhangs were drastically limited. As well as that houses had to be built in future with the eaves side facing the road. Only small attics were certified as opposed to gabled dormers. In 1785, Johann Georg Christian Hess took office as city architect. In 1809 he wrote a set of articles for the city of Frankfurt on behalf of the Grand Duke Carl Theodor von Dalberg, which basically remained in force until 1880. It made classicism mandatory as an architectural style. Hess was influenced by the spirit of the Enlightenment and campaigned radically for the architecture of classicism. He refused to preserve the numerous medieval buildings in Frankfurt because they did not meet his hygienic and aesthetic requirements. In the new town and in the new neighbourhoods emerging outside of the city walls, which were torn from 1804 to 1808, he effortlessly prevailed with his ideas, but in the old town he encountered stubborn resistance from conservative citizens. Only the new public buildings emerging in the old town, e.g. B. the Paulskirche (1833) or the Alte B√∂rse (1843) on Paulsplatz corresponded to his classicist ideal. = The decline of the Altstadt in the 19th century = Back yard at Tuchgaden 9, around 1880 In the 19th century, Frankfurt was considered one of the most beautiful cities in Germany due to the numerous classical buildings. The medieval old town, on the other hand, was considered backward and outdated. Goethe made Mephisto scoff at the old town: : I chose a capital like this In the core citizen food horror. Crowds of alleyways, steep gables, Restricted market, cabbage, beets, onions; Meat banks where the Schmeissen live, To feast on the fat roasts; You will find it there at all times Certainly smell and activity. (Faust. The tragedy, part four, act four. High mountains) The city historian Anton Kirchner also wrote in 1818 in his panel work Views of Frankfurt am Main about the buildings of the old town. The classicist zeitgeist is clear from the description: Kanngie√üergasse, around 1900 Nonnengasse, around 1915 Max Meckel's preliminary design for the redesign of the Roman, 1890 The loss of image corresponded to a political and economic decline. The Frankfurt fair, which was held twice a year in the old town, had passed to Leipzig in the middle of the 18th century. With the end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, imperial coronations no longer took place. The economic and political focus of Frankfurt has been the Neustadt since the Napoleonic Wars. After the restoration of the Free City of Frankfurt at the Vienna Congress, the Bundestag took its seat here in the Palais Thurn and Taxis. Frankfurt became the European financial centre with the banking houses Bethmann, Rothschild and Gontard. The trade fair business no longer played a role in goods traffic; instead, the city's good transport links became the engine of the economic upswing. Around 1830 steam shipping was introduced on the Main, in 1836 Frankfurt joined the German Customs Union and as early as 1839 there was an important node in the emerging German rail network. This economic boom passed the old town. At the latest after the annexation of Frankfurt by Prussia in 1866, the wealthy citizens moved to the new districts outside the ramparts, especially to the Westend. The city centre gradually shifted to the new town, where numerous Wilhelminian style buildings were erected at the Hauptwache, the Zeil and the Ro√ümarkt. The former exhibition halls in the buildings of the old town were transformed into warehouses or second-hand shops, the long-established craftsmen were forced to move to the new town with their customers. When the new small market hall between Fahrengasse and Hasengasse was built between 1877 and 1878, the traditional parapets also disappeared. The former Coronation Trail Markt no longer deserved its name, which was a symbol of the beginning social and structural deterioration of the old town. The horse-drawn tram, which started operating in 1872, did not reach the old town either. The early photographs of the old town, for example by Carl Friedrich Mylius, or the watercolors by Carl Theodor Reiffenstein not only show the picturesque and beautiful sides of the old town, but are also witnesses of their decay. The first street widenings were made in the second half of the 19th century in order to better open the old town to traffic. In 1855 the Liebfrauengasse between Liebfrauenberg and Zeil was built, in 1872 the Wei√üfrauengasse in the west to connect the old town with the train stations at the Taunusanlage. The associated loss of historical building substance, in particular the demolition of the white deer, was accepted. The Lower Main Bridge and the Upper Main Bridge were built in 1874 and 1878. The Old Bridge and Fahrgasse lost their importance because the traffic flowed around the old town as far as possible. The medieval houses, not to mention their backyards, were now often in poor condition. The hygienic conditions improved with the construction of an alluvial sewage system based on the English model from 1867. More and more houses were connected to the drinking water network, especially after the construction of a pipeline from Vogelsberg in 1873. In the course of industrialisation after 1870, numerous workers flocked to the city who quickly found cheap housing in the dilapidated buildings. Large parts of the old town were now considered to be the residential area of the proletariat and poorer petty bourgeois, where poverty, prostitution and crime were rampant. At the same time, however, one began to discover the picturesque sides of the old town and open it up to tourism. On many half-timbered buildings, the plaster applied in the early 19th century was removed and the compartment was often painted historically afterwards. The painting preferred to refer to Frankfurt's important past, so that well-known postcard motifs were created in the touristically important places such as the Roseneck or the Five-Finger Square. As in the classicist era, however, many measures were limited to public buildings: in 1874, the medieval city scales were demolished. Cathedral master builder Franz Josef Denzinger created a neo- Gothic, much larger new building until 1877. Other large medieval buildings such as churches or patrician houses were restored or decorated with historic jewelry. The best-known example is the conversion of the Roman by Max Meckel (1896‚Äì1900). = The old town in the early 20th century = Touristic houses on Roseneck, around 1900 By the beginning of the 20th century, the structure of the old town had remained largely unchanged since the Middle Ages, as a comparison with Merian copper engravings shows. In the old town alone there were around 2,000 historic buildings. The wooden half-timbered houses were still predominant, although there were a few stone patrician houses and numerous public buildings. Almost all stone buildings were made of local red sandstone. Airship image of the old town, 1911 The first really far-reaching structural change in the old town took place in the years 1904‚Äì1908 with the creation of a new road breakthrough; Braubachstrasse. This was in order to better open up the old town to traffic, especially for the tram. Around 100 old town houses, including art-historical complexes that date back to the Middle Ages, such as the N√ºrnberger Hof or the Hof Rebstock, were demolished. Representative new buildings were created, whichin their historizing architecture in turn (albeit on a larger and more magnificent scale) incorporated motifs from the old town. The corner house Braubachstrasse / Neue Kr√§me from 1906, for example, copies the typical Frankfurt town house around 1700. Frankfurts old town was gradually recognised for its cultural and historical value as one of the best preserved old towns in Central Europe. = The resurgence and the \\"old town recovery\\" = The National Socialists planned to replace parts of the old town, until 1933 also a communist stronghold, with historicized new buildings. A citizens' initiative, the association of active friends of the old town founded in 1922 under the direction of art historian Fried L√ºbbecke, opposed these efforts. The federal government has had numerous old town buildings restored since 1926. However, as a pure association, it was limited in its resources, so that it was largely a matter of less substantial measures such as cleaning or repainting old buildings. Only with external financial help can comparatively important campaigns such as the purchase and renovation of the important Gothic patrician house F√ºrsteneck in Fahrgasse. Until the measures came to a complete standstill as a result of the war in the early 1940s, more than 600 buildings were thoroughly renovated, historically unsuitable extensions were removed and wells were repaired. Fried L√ºbbecke in particular described in detail how this made the old town into the good Stubb of Frankfurt within just a decade. Even facilities such as the unemployed kitchen, summer parties and Christmas presents for the old town children or the artist Christmas market made many old town residents feel proud of their homeland again. After the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933, the new regime raised the so-called old town recovery to a prestige project. In Nazi Germany, word creation was an umbrella term for measures taken by the city administration to preserve the old town as an overall monument; they took place simultaneously in Hamburg, Cologne, Braunschweig, Kassel and Hanover, among others. In Frankfurt am Main, a distinction was made between: * Evictions, * New buildings or reconstructive additions and * Half-timbered exposures Treuner's old town model : very detailed core of the old town in its condition around 1926, from the east. The clearing out was a euphemism for in part extensive gutting measures, in modern usage the \\"renovation by demolition\\" that was common until the 1970s, which was carried out in some of the courtyards that were completely built up over the centuries. The Nazi city administration under Mayor Friedrich Krebs used the project to change the social structure of the old town in terms of its ideology. Old-established residents of the old town should be displaced in new housing developments on the outskirts of the city and the renovated old town apartments should primarily be awarded to traders, craftsmen and party members. In doing so, the city also wanted to correspond to its Nazi honorary title awarded in 1935 as the city of German crafts. Fried L√ºbbecke and the poet Alfons Paquet opposed the destruction of medieval buildings. Her submissions were disqualified as \\"shouting from old town fanatics who judge things of community life not even out of bad will but from a limited view\\". ... and in the same model from the west. As a result of the clearing out, behind the five-finger biscuit the handicraft farm between Goldhutgasse, Markt, Langer Schirn and Bendergasse as well as the cherry orchard between Gro√üer and Kleiner Fischergasse and Mainkai south of the cathedral. The Hainer Hof to the north-east of the cathedral was also almost completely replaced by new buildings, some of which can still be seen today due to the minor war damage there. Likewise, the green space around the choir of the Carmelite Church is not a result of the war, but the goal of further evacuation, which eliminated numerous 19th-century extensions there. Completely new buildings such as those in the Hainer Hof were rarely seen as part of the renovation. Mostly, it was a question of reconstructions or additions using traditional technology, which were necessary, in particular, after the cores had been removed to provide facades for the houses in the newly created courtyards. In the case of the half-timbered buildings in particular, however, entire rotten beam layers often had to be completely replaced. A good example of a reconstruction is the restoration of the Renaissance gable at the Haus Klein-Limpurg on the corner of Limpurger Gasse and R√∂merberg. It was based on illustrations of the building on old engravings, and during the construction work, substance from the Renaissance was actually uncovered, which had been reshaped during the classicist redesign of the building around 1800. Finally, there were numerous half-timbered buildings in the entire old town area. Since many of them only took place in the late 1930s or early 1940s, they are hardly documented, let alone known, even in popular pictures of the old town. Among other things, exposures were made at the house Zur golden Weinrebe on the corner of Liebfrauenberg / T√∂ngesgasse, at the house Zum Feigenbaum on the corner of Wildemannsgasse / Schnurgasse or at the Pesthaus at the five-finger cookie. The latter had been given a thematic repaint by the Altstadtbund just ten years earlier. Planned reconstructions of carefully stored half-timbered houses, such as the Great Warehouse or the Heydentanz House, on selected parcels of the old town no longer occurred. = The destruction in World War II = Template: main article At the latest since February 14, 1942, with the adoption of the British Area Bombing Directive, it became apparent that the old town of Frankfurt am Main could also become the target of the bomb war. The Federation of Friends of the Old Town, therefore, often with the help of external institutions such as the students from the Frankfurt School of Engineering or retired architects, had the entire existing building stock photographed and drawn as of summer 1942. Aerial view of the old town from the north in March 1945 The destroyed old town from the east according to the rubble model of the Historical Museum The first serious air raid on Frankfurt am Main hit the old town on October 4, 1943. The Romans and the Area between Liebfrauenberg, T√∂ngesgasse and Hasengasse. Further attacks on December 20, 1943 and January 29, 1944 caused only minor damage in the old town, but destroyed the city archive with a large part of the archive material. On March 18, 1944, 846 British aircraft dropped their aerial bombs over Frankfurt. They mainly hit the eastern part of the old town and completely destroyed the area around Fahrgasse. They also caused severe damage in the western old town, the Paulskirche burned down completely. The worst blow was yet to come: On March 22, 1944, another British air raid of 816 aircraft destroyed large parts of the old town that had previously been spared, including all churches except the Old Nikolaikirche and Leonhardskirche. According to official information, 500 air mines, 3,000 heavy explosive bombs and 1.2 million incendiary bombs were dropped on the city in just under an hour, with a clear focus on the city centre. As with previous air raids, this was part of the tactic: the majority of all houses in the old town were built in half-timbered construction, so that they largely burned completely in the unleashed firestorm. But patrician buildings from the Middle Ages built of stone, such as the canvas house or the stone house, were also destroyed by explosive devices. This air raid is also reproduced in a chalk drawing by the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann, who painted what was happening on the Sachsenhausen side. The drawing shows how the old town and sky are brightly lit due to the fire.Abbildung der Zeichnung auf der Website frankfurt1933-1945.de (). The artist's house and emergency shelter were also bombed out. Characteristic of the force of the attack is the fact that in the morning hours of March 24, 1944, there was not a single house in Tuchgaden, where practically all the ground floors consisted of massive stone vaults. Of the approximately 2,000 half-timbered houses, only one - the Wertheim am Fahrtor house - remained undamaged. The fire department had protected it with a water curtain to keep the escape route from R√∂merberg to the banks of the Main open. The last major attack of the month followed on March 24, this time a daily attack by 262 aircraft of the American Air Force. In total, more than 1,500 people were killed in the attacks in March 1944. The main reason for the fact that the number of victims was not higher than in other cities was that, since the summer of 1940, the solidly built cellars of the old town houses had been interconnected. An emergency exit at the Fountain of Justice on the R√∂merberg alone saved around 800 people. An impression of the destruction can be obtained from the historic model of the Treuner brothers exhibited in the Historical Museum, who in the years before the destruction had measured and reconstructed most of the houses in the old town on a scale of 1: 200. The debris model shown next shows the extent of the destruction of this bombing night. However, it should be viewed with caution, since contemporary photographs show significantly more surviving building remains. = The post-war period: reconstruction and second destruction = Sorting rubble, 1947 View from the cathedral, 1952. Large parts of the old town were completely rebuilt after the destruction of the Second World War, so that very few buildings with historical buildings remain are. After the clearing, modernisers and keepers faced each other - as is often the case at this time - so that there was initially a construction stop until 1952. Even the keepers, essentially represented by the Bund of old town friends, did not campaign for extensive reconstruction, but above all called for the preservation of the old road network with a small-scale new construction and the reconstruction of some important buildings. Finally, albeit with a clear tendency towards modernisation, a mixed solution was found: some prominent monuments were reconstructed, the first being the Paulskirche in 1947 and the Goethe House in 1949. After 1952 followed the landmark of Frankfurt, the Roman, as well as the Staufen wall, the stone house, the Saalhof, the Carmelite monastery and the canvas house. From the destroyed endowment churches located in the old town, the cathedral, the Old Nikolaikirche, the Liebfrauenkirche and the Dominican monastery were rebuilt from urban funds from 1952 to 1962. The burnt-out ruins of the Gothic Wei√üfrauenkirche and the classicist German-Reformed church were removed in 1953. Dom-R√∂mer-Areal, 1956 Of the reconstructed buildings, only the Goethe House was largely restored to the original. Most other reconstructions were more or less simplified (for example the houses Silberberg, Frauenstein and Salzhaus in the Roman complex) or with modern additions (for example the stone house). Much of the former old town was built on in the simple style of the 1950s. The main result was multi- storey houses, partly as block perimeter development, partly as loosened row buildings, often with green inner courtyards. In addition, large-scale functional buildings such as the Federal Audit Office building in Frankfurt am Main, the Kleinmarkthalle and numerous parking garages were erected, including in 1956 the parking garage Hauptwache as Germany's first public parking garage. Furthermore, new main roads were pulled through the wreckage, rejecting the historical floor plan. This should make car-friendly Frankfurt, which was often desired even before the war, a reality. This was realized in the form of the east-west axis, inaugurated on November 16, 1953 as the street at the Paulskirche and from 1955 until today known as Berliner Stra√üe. It connects the also widened Wei√üfrauenstrasse with the north-south axis of Kurt- Schumacher-Strasse that runs through the inner city center. In 1955, the ten- story high-rise was completed at the intersection of Berliner Strasse and Fahrgasse. At 30 meters, it is the tallest residential building in the old town. The area between the cathedral and the R√∂mer initially remained a wasteland, the development of which was long debated. In the early 1970s, the Technical City Hall (1972‚Äì1974) and the Historical Museum (1971/72) were two large, monolithic buildings in a brutalist concrete style, regardless of historical layouts and shapes. = Reconstruction of historical buildings = The imperial cathedral and the reconstructed town house \\"Gro√üer Engel\\" In 1981 to 1983, the historic east side of the R√∂merberg was reconstructed with five half-timbered buildings, above all the famous town house Gro√üer Engel. The other reconstructions, which are particularly fortunate to represent all forms of the local half-timbered building from Gothic to Classicism, can be seen as prototypical for the urban effect of the development of the entire district that was preserved until 1944. Unlike the historical models, the facades of the new buildings with their half-timbering remained unplastered. Some of its structure is extrapolated from known individual constructive forms, photographs and analogue conclusions, since building plans have not been preserved for all buildings. Since the beams and their infill were traditionally plastered or slated, decorative forms were installed in the now visible half-timbering, which were borrowed from other buildings of comparable construction. Aerial view of the largest reconstructed Altstadt area in 2018 after the completion of the Dom Romer project. House of the Golden Scales - 2018 After just a few years, there was considerable structural damage that required extensive renovation. As it turned out, the contracted construction companies no longer had the essential skills for a half-timbered building. For example, the timber from Alsace was not dried long enough and the beams were not properly connected. The Kunsthalle Schirn and the postmodern new buildings on Saalgasse were created simultaneously with the historicizing reconstructions. In 1991 the Museum of Modern Art opened on Braubachstrasse. The Haus am Dom, an educational center of the Catholic diocese of Limburg, was built in 2007 on Domstrasse on the preserved substructure of the former main customs office from 1927. After the decision of the city council to demolish the Technical City Hall, A technical and emotional discussion about the reconstruction of this old town district began when almost the entire historical nucleus of the city between the cathedral and the Roman became an open space again. In 2007, the factions of the CDU and B√ºndnis 90 / Die Gr√ºnen, ruling since the municipal elections in Frankfurt in 2006, reached an agreement with the FDP and the free voters against the votes of the SPD and Die Linke for the new construction of the Dom-R√∂mer area on a compromise. The city had eight historical buildings reconstructed as the client, with \\"the historical district floor plan largely being used as the basis for planning\\", including the Haus zur Goldenen Waage and the Neue Rote Haus am Markt, the Haus zum Esslinger (also as the aunt's house) Marked Melber) at the H√ºhnermarkt and the Goldene L√§mmchen. In addition, the city had the Alter Esslinger house, the Klein N√ºrnberg house and parts of the Rebstock farm, located between the latter two. The remaining 32 parcels were awarded to builders who had 7 further reconstructions built. For the new buildings, with which well-known architects were commissioned to plan, there was a strict design statute that stipulated, among other things, the shape of the roof, the height of the buildings and the materials used. Construction started in 2012. At the end of 2017, the buildings were completed externally. In September 2018, the New Old Town was opened with a three-day festival The concrete building of the Historical Museum was demolished in 2012 and replaced by a new building opened in October 2017.  Districts and sights of the Altstadt  There are numerous sights in the old town - although most of the buildings are only reconstructions after severe war destruction. All sights are close together and can be reached by tram and subway. = R√∂merberg and surroundings = R√∂merberg with R√∂mer Samstagsberg, Frankfurt, West view 2019 The R√∂merberg is the centre of the old town. Here stands the R√∂mer, the historic town hall and symbol of the city. It was acquired in 1405 by the city, which needed a new town hall, as the previous town hall had to be demolished to build the cathedral tower. By 1878 the ten neighboring houses were also acquired by the city and structurally connected to the Roman. The five houses next to each other, whose facade faces the R√∂merberg, are called Alt Limpurg, Zum R√∂mer, L√∂wenstein, Frauenstein and Salzhaus. Before its destruction, the salt house was one of the most beautiful half-timbered houses in Germany. It was rebuilt in a simplified manner after the war was destroyed. In the middle of the square is the Justice Fountain, which was built from sandstone in the 17th century. The construction was replaced in 1887 by a bronze replica. His name comes from the statue of Justitia that crowns him. In contrast to her depictions, Justitia was not blindfolded in Frankfurt. According to tradition, the fountain was fed with red and white wine at imperial coronations. Since the Middle Ages, the square has been surrounded by residential and commercial buildings - the reconstructed half-timbered houses of the Samstagsberg (also known as the Ostzeile ), including the houses Gro√üer and Kleiner Engel and Schwarzer Stern, are particularly worth mentioning here. Wertheim House, the only original half-timbered house in the old town (2013) The Wertheim House (around 1600), is the only completely undamaged preserved half-timbered house in the old town. It is an ornate three-story Renaissance house with the stone ground floor common in Frankfurt. Opposite is the Rententurm, an important Frankfurt port building, where customs duties and port fees were collected. It was completed in 1456. North of the R√∂merberg on Paulsplatz is the New Town Hall, built around 1900 with rich Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque decor, as well as the Paulskirche, where the German National Assembly met in 1848/1849. = Cathedral area = Around 300 meters east of the R√∂merberg rises the largest and most important church in the city, the Catholic imperial cathedral St. Bartholomew with its 95 meter high west tower. The majority of German kings were chosen here since the Middle Ages. From 1562 to 1792, 10 emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were crowned in the Bartholom√§uskirche. The market (Kramgasse in the Middle Ages) runs between the cathedral and R√∂merberg, the main street of the old town that was rebuilt more than 70 years after its destruction. The Coronation Trail ran here, which the Emperor took after the coronation to celebrate the R√∂merberg. Canvas House Frankfurt, 2009 In front of the west tower of the cathedral is the archaeological garden, which was built over 2012 to 2015 with the town house on the market, in which the remains of the foundations of the Roman military camp, the Carolingian Palatinate and medieval town houses are open to the public. The streets behind the L√§mmchen, Neugasse and the H√ºhnermarkt, which have been resurrected after the demolition of the Technical Town Hall, with their new buildings and reconstructions have been accessible again since May 2018. With the House of the Golden Waage and the New Red House, two of the most famous half-timbered buildings in the old town were rebuilt. Further reconstructions are the houses Gr√ºne Linde, W√ºrzgarten and Rotes Haus am Markt. Striking new buildings are the Gro√üer Rebstock houses on the market next to the Haus am Dom, Neues Paradies on the corner of the H√ºhnermarkt, Altes Kaufhaus, the city of Milan and Zu den Drei R√∂mer on the western edge of the new development area. On the north side of the Old Market is the Stone House, a 15th-century Gothic patrician building. It is the seat of the Frankfurter Kunstverein. A gate passage from the N√ºrnberger Hof (around 1410), the trade fair quarter of the Nuremberg merchants, has been preserved near the Stone House. The Kunsthalle Schirn, opened in 1986, stretches south of the market, for example along the former Bendergasse. In the same block, on the north side of Saalgasse, townhouses were built in the proportions of the former old town, but in the postmodern architectural style of the time. South of the cathedral on Weckmarkt is the canvas house, architecturally related to the stone house, which today houses the Museum of Comic Art. Between the cathedral, Fahrgasse and Main was built in the style of the time in the 1950s. Most of the historic streets of the former butcher's quarter were lost. Quiet, green courtyards were created, whose irregular design and small passageways could remind people with a lot of imagination of the enchanted old town streets. In the former old town there were numerous small fountains, many of which could be saved and put back in the courtyards. = Western old town = Leonhardskirche Carmelite monastery The most striking building in the western old town is the Leonhardskirche, the only church in downtown Frankfurt that remained undamaged in the Second World War. The north portal and the two east towers are still Romanesque, the basilica itself is late Gothic. Cathedral choir Madern Gerthener designed the high choir. A few steps away is the former Carmelite monastery, today the seat of the Institute for Urban History and the Archaeological Museum. The Goethe House, the poet's birthplace, is located north of Berliner Strasse in the Gro√üer Hirschgraben. = Northern old town = The northern old town is the area between today's Berliner Stra√üe and the Staufenmauer, the former course of which can be seen on the Graben streets (Hirschgraben, Holzgraben). It is the area that the city gained through the second expansion in the 12th century. In contrast to the older part in the area of the former Carolingian Palatinate, which has an irregular road network, the northern old town had an almost right-angled road structure. Most of the northern part of the old town was destroyed on June 26, 1719 during the \\"Great Christian Fire\\" (eight years earlier to distinguish it from the \\"Great Jewish Fire\\" in Judengasse). In the area between Fahrgasse, Schnurgasse and T√∂ngesgasse, 282 people died and 425 houses were destroyed.Chronik der Frankfurter Feuerwehr However, the area was quickly rebuilt on the old, small plots. = Eastern old town = The eastern old town, the Judengasse, the Staufenmauer and the Bornheimer Tor, 1628 The main street of the eastern old town was the Fahrgasse. It ran from the Bornheim gate at the Konstablerwache to the Old Bridge; all traffic over the only Main crossing between Mainz and Aschaffenburg passed through this street. To the east of Fahrgasse is the former Dominican monastery, rebuilt from 1953 to 1957 on the old floor plan, with the Church of the Holy Spirit. It is the seat of the Evangelical City Deanery and the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt. To the east of it is B√∂rneplatz, the largest and busiest square in the district. Under changing names, it was the centre of Jewish life in Frankfurt. The Judengasse ended here, since 1882 the B√∂rneplatz synagogue, destroyed in the November pogroms in 1938, was here, and the Old Jewish Cemetery, Battonnstrasse, whose oldest grave monuments date from 1272, is still located here today. In the Judengasse Museum, part of the Frankfurt Jewish Museum, excavated remains of the ghetto and the synagogue can be viewed. = Former and reconstructed buildings = The old stock exchange closed the square next to the Paulskirche, around 1845 Old bridge around 1600, watercolour from 1889 Gas pipes and sewer construction on the Coronation route in 1867 Behind the L√§mmchen, 2018 Chicken market, 2018 Flour scale and F√ºrsteneck at the food stall, around 1880 The old tourist magnet the 'Roseneck', a cluster of medieval buildings near the Cathedral around 1900. Many architectural monuments as well as striking buildings or street corners or entire streets of the old town were lost as a result of the Second World War or due to demolition, some of them were rebuilt or reconstructed - some more than 70 years after their destruction. Here are a few of the most important: * The old stock exchange on Paulsplatz was a building of late classicism, built in 1843, burned out in 1944 and demolished in 1952. * The old bridge was first mentioned in 1222. It has been destroyed and rebuilt at least 18 times over the centuries. In 1914 the only beautiful monument from earlier times (Goethe) worthy of such a large city was demolished. The New Old Bridge, inaugurated in its place in 1926, was simply rebuilt after the war was destroyed in 1965. * Bendergasse was the epitome of an old town alley with numerous five- to six-story half-timbered buildings from the 16th to 18th centuries. Destroyed in 1944, the site was cleared until 1950. Today the Schirn art gallery is located here. * The Five-Finger Square was a popular postcard motif, a tiny old town square near the R√∂merberg (burned out in 1944). * The Haus zum Esslinger on the Chicken Market was a baroque altered, late Gothic half-timbered building in which Goethe's aunt Johanna Melber lived in the 18th century, which he also described in his autobiographical work Poetry and Truth. The building burned down in 1944 and the ruins were removed in 1950. The reconstruction opened in 2018 is the seat of the Struwwelpeter Museum. * The F√ºrsteneck house was a Gothic patrician stone building from the 13th century. Extensively restored in the 1920s, it burned out in 1944. The remains were torn down after the war. * The House of the Golden Scales in H√∂llgasse west of the cathedral was an elaborately decorated Renaissance half-timbered building. Built between 1618 and 1619, it was renovated at the beginning of the 20th century. The Golden Scales burned out in 1944 and its remains were cleared in 1950. The reconstruction of the Golden Scales will reopen in 2018 as a branch of the Historical Museum. * The Lichtenstein house was a Gothic patrician stone house on the south-western R√∂merberg, which was changed in the 18th century in the Baroque style. It burned down in 1944, the well-preserved but unsecured ruin was badly damaged in a storm in 1946 and, shortly thereafter, was torn down despite the planned reconstruction. * The Rebstock farm was a half-timbered building from the 17th century and one of the most important inns in the old town. The poet Friedrich Stoltze was born here in 1816. Large parts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century for the breakthrough of Braubachstrasse, the rest were destroyed in 1944. * Behind the L√§mmchen was the name of a narrow alley between the N√ºrnberger Hof and the Chicken Market, in which some of the most important half-timbered houses in the city were located, including the houses Zum N√ºrnberger Hof, Zum Mohrenkopf and Goldenes L√§mmchen. From 1974 to 2010, the entire area with the Technical Town Hall was built over. * The Chicken Market between the cathedral and the R√∂mer was a picturesque ensemble of half- timbered houses from the 17th and 18th centuries: the most important were the Old Red House and the New Red House at the entrance to the Tuchgaden. Both have since been reconstructed. The Stoltze Fountain stood on the chicken market until 1944, which returned to its regular place in 2016. The Schildknecht house on H√ºhnermarkt, built around 1405, had the largest overhang of all Frankfurt half-timbered houses at almost two meters. * From 1462 to 1796, Judengasse was the Frankfurt ghetto. Their remains were burned down and rebuilt several times between 1874 and 1888. Only the synagogue and the Rothschildhaus were initially preserved. The synagogue fell victim to the November pogroms in 1938, the Rothschildhaus in 1944 to the bombing. * The herb market was a place at the exit of Bendergasse to the cathedral. The baroque stone houses of the late 18th century were completely destroyed in 1944. * The market was historically the most important old town alley in Frankfurt. The coronation route of the German emperors from the cathedral to the Roman ran through him. The countless, mostly richly decorated half- timbered buildings from the 16th to the 18th centuries were destroyed in 1944. At the beginning of the 1970s, the area was built over with the Technical Town Hall and the R√∂mer underground station. After the town hall was demolished, the market was built again. The houses Goldene Waage, Gr√ºne Linde, Rotes Haus, Neues Rotes Haus, Schlegel and W√ºrzgarten were reconstructed. * The flour scale at Gark√ºchenplatz was built in 1719. The flour was officially weighed and cleared on the ground floor, and the upper floors served as a city prison until 1866. The building was extensively renovated in 1938 and destroyed in 1944. * The N√ºrnberger Hof was an extensive building complex from the 13th century. It was largely torn down when the Braubachstrasse was built in 1905. The rest suffered severe bomb damage in 1944 and was demolished in 1953 except for the baroque gate in favor of Berliner Strasse. * The Roseneck was a very beautiful group of half-timbered houses south of the cathedral. It was completely destroyed in 1944. * Saalgasse ran south of the Old Nikolaikirche parallel to Bendergasse. Its numerous multi-storey half-timbered buildings and some stone buildings from the 16th to the 18th centuries were destroyed in 1944 and the remains were cleared after the war. The south side was rebuilt in the 1950s, and a number of postmodern town houses were built on the north side in the early 1980s. * The Scharnh√§user on Heilig-Geist-Pl√§tzchen in Saalgasse were two baroque modified, late Gothic half-timbered buildings with public passageways on their ground floors on wooden pillars. In the 1770s, Johann Wolfgang Goethe conducted a successful lawsuit around one of the buildings. The buildings burned down in 1944 and were cleared until 1950. * The Weckmarkt, south of the cathedral, was home to the canvas house built in 1399 and the former city scales from 1504, two of the most important medieval stone buildings in Frankfurt. The city scales were rebuilt around 1880 by cathedral architect Franz Josef Denzinger in the neo-Gothic style. It housed the city archive until it was destroyed in 1944. The ruins of the canvas house were rebuilt in 1982.  Culture  In the old town there are numerous museums that are part of the so-called museum bank along the Main, including the Jewish Museum, the Archaeological Museum in the Carmelite Monastery, the Historical Museum with a focus on city history, the Schirn Art Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art. The Steinerne Haus, seat of the Frankfurter Kunstverein, the canvas house and the Literature house Frankfurt in the old city library are important domiciles of the Frankfurt art scene, which are located in three reconstructed historical buildings. Among the Frankfurt theatres, three, namely the comedy, the Volksb√ºhne and the cabaret Die Schmiere, have their venues in the old town. In the past, the old town was generally not particularly busy in the evening, except for major events such as the Museumsuferfest. Public traffic has increased significantly since the beginning of the 21st century, especially among tourists. During the 2006 World Cup, numerous soccer games were broadcast in the specially built Main Arena, an open-air cinema for around 15,000 visitors on the northern bank of the Main.

Gyeongju is a coastal city in the far southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang province in South Korea. It is the second largest city by area in the province after Andong, covering 1,324 km2 (511 sq mi) with a population of 269,343 people according to the 2008 census. The early history of Gyeongju is closely tied to that of the Silla kingdom, of which it was the capital for nearly one thousand years. Silla period Burial mounds of the Silla kings Gyeongju first enters non-Korean records during the Samhan period in the early Common Era. It is recorded in Chinese records as Saro-guk, one of twelve petty states which comprised the Jinhan confederacy. Saro-guk would later become the Silla kingdom. Korean records, probably based on the dynastic chronicles of Silla, record that Saro- guk was established in 57 BCE, when six small villages in the Gyeongju area united under Bak Hyeokgose, the kingdom's first ruler. During the Silla period, the city was called \\"Seorabeol\\" (ÏÑúÎùºÎ≤å; Ë•øÁæÖ‰ºê) that is assumed to mean Capital, \\"Gyerim which literally means Rooster's forest,\\" or \\"Geumseong\\" (Í∏àÏÑ±; ÈáëÊàê) that refers to \\"City of Gold\\". After the unification of the peninsula up to Taedong RiverRobinson et al. 2007. p.26 in 668 AD, Gyeongju became the center of Korean political and cultural life.Robinson et al. 2007. p.28 The city was home to the Silla court, and the great majority of the kingdom's elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book, The Book of Roads and Kingdoms.Lee Gwang- pyo (Ïù¥Í¥ëÌëú) (2008-04-05) (in Korean) [‚ÄòÌô©Í∏àÏùò Ï†úÍµ≠‚Äô ÌéòÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ <3>ÌéòÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑÏù∏Îì§ Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎ•º ÌôúÎ≥¥ÌïòÎã§ (['Empire of Gold', Persia] Persians strode away in Gyeongju)] Dong-a Ilbo(in Korean) Ïù¥Î∏ê Ïø†Î•¥Îã§ÏßÄÎ∞î Abu'I QƒÅsim AbƒÅdu'l LƒÅh Ibn KhurdƒÅhibah a (816 ~ 912) Doosan Encyclopedia Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million.Breen (1999), p.82 Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this period, known as Unified Silla. However, the city's prosperity proved short-lived. In the late 9th century the Silla kingdom declined and fell apart, giving way to the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea. In 927 Gyeongju was pillaged by Hubaekje, one of these later kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, King Gyeongsun surrendered his title and country to Taejo in 935, who then established the Goryeo dynasty. Gyeongju was no longer the capital of a united Korea, while Gaegyeong (modern-day Kaesong) took that title. Goryeo and Joseon periods Landmarks of Gyeongju are shown on a map made between the late 17th century and mid-18th century.Ï¢åÌÜµÏßÄÎèÑ-ÏßÄÏó≠ : Í≤ΩÏÉÅÎèÑ ÏßÄÎèÑÎ™Ö : Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎ∂Ä (Jwatongjido- Region: Gyeongsang province : Gyeongjubu Kyujanggak Under the Goryeo dynasty (935‚Äì1392), Gyeongju was no longer of national importance. However, it remained a regional center. The city was given its modern name \\"Gyeongju\\" by King Taejo in 940, and was made the seat of Yeongnam Province. It had jurisdiction over a wide area, including much of east-central Yeongnam. Gyeongju was designated the \\"Eastern Capital\\" in 987, but that title was removed in 1012.Lee, (1984), pp. 115-116 For much of the Goryeo period, it was also the seat of the Andong Daedohobu, the Great Protectorate of the East, which oversaw military affairs for much of eastern and central Korea. However, it was stripped of this distinction as well in the 13th century, after bloody rebellions connected with the Silla restoration movement broke out in the area. At the same time, its boundaries were considerably reduced.Kookmin University (2004), p. 29. Also mentioned in Lee (1984), p. 144 During the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), the city declined yet further. It ceased to occupy a central position as the Great Yeongnam Road became the Gyeongsang province's chief artery. This road connected Seoul to the southeastern port of Dongnae (in modern-day Busan) without passing near Gyeongju. In 1601, the provincial capital passed to Daegu, which was located on the main road. Over these centuries, the city's relics suffered numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa.Lee,(1984), p.149. During the Imjin War (1592‚Äì1598), the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa.Lee,(1984), p.214Cole, Teresa Levonian (11 October 2003) My brilliant Korea The Guardian Not all damage was due to invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, a great deal of damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.Kookmin University (2004), p. 27. Since 1900 The city's boundaries and designation changed several times in the 20th century. From 1895 to 1955, the area was known as Gyeongju-gun (\\"Gyeongju County\\"). In the first decades of the century, the city center was known as Gyeongju-myeon, signifying a relatively rural rea. In 1931, the downtown area was designated Gyeongju-eup, in recognition of its increasingly urban nature. In 1955, Gyeongju-eup became Gyeongju-si (\\"Gyeongju City\\"), the same name as today but with a much smaller area. The remainder of Gyeongju-gun became \\"Wolseong County.\\" The county and city were reunited in 1995, creating Gyeongju City as we know it today. From the 1900s (decade) to the early 1970s, Gyeongju had remained relatively small and all glories of the past were gone.(2006-03-29) Í≤ΩÏ£ºÏùò Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞Íæº, ÍπÄÎèôÎ¶¨ (Gyeongju's storyteller, Kim Dong-ni (in Korean) KBSYun, Wan-jun (Ïú§ÏôÑÏ§Ä) (2008-11-01) (in Korean) Ïù∏Î¨∏ÏÇ¨Ìöå Î∂àÍµ≠ÏÇ¨Î•º Ï≤†Í∑º ÏΩòÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ìä∏Î°ú Î≥µÏõêÌïòÎùº?

A museum, the forerunner of the present-day Gyeongju National Museum, was set up in 1915 to exhibit the finds. The excavations of this period, largely carried out by Japanese archaeologists, are often accused of recklessness and plunder, although others take a more positive view. Few excavation reports were ever published. Gyeongju emerged as a railroad junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation. The Donghae Nambu Line was completed in 1935, cutting directly through the historical areas of central Gyeongju. The Jungang Line was completed in 1942, and Gyeongju became directly connected to Gyeongseong (present-day Seoul). This helped to lay the foundations for future industrial development. Thanks to these improved connections, this period also saw the town beginning to emerge as a center of tourism. Following liberation in 1945, Korea was plunged into turmoil. Gyeongju was no exception. Returnees from abroad were numerous; a village for them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains. The Korean War broke out in 1950. Most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood on the front lines, as North Korean forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang. In the 1970s, Korea saw substantial industrial development, much of it centered in the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part. In 1971, the Gyeongbu Expressway was completed connecting Seoul and Busan, and passing through Gyeongju on the way. The POSCO steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973, and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan emerged in the same year. These developments helped to support the emergence of the manufacturing sector in Gyeongju. For almost all of the 20th century, the people of the city had no direct say in their government. The mayors of Gyeongju, like those of all other cities, were directly appointed by the central government, whether the government was that of the Joseon Dynasty, Japanese occupation, or modern South Korea. This changed in 1995, with the establishment of local autonomy throughout the country. The city's first elected mayor was the unaffiliated Lee Won-shik, who served from 1995 to 1998. In September 2015 the city was hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8, but no major damage or injuries were reported.

It was constructed in the late 18th century to feed the Caldon Canal. During the 19th century, it was a popular destination for daytrippers taking advantage of easy access using the newly constructed North Staffordshire Railway. The lake is still used for many water activities such as boating, canoeing, fishing and also for walks and recreational steam train trips. History Legend has it that the village of Rudyard was named after Ralph Rudyard, a local man reputed to have killed Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, although as the place-name, meaning 'a yard or enclosure where rue is grown' in Old English, was first recorded in 1022 and subsequently mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 it is more likely that Ralph, if he ever existed, was named after the village.The Potteries ‚Äì Did You Know, Rudyard Lake Accessed 16 July 2012 Rudyard Lake was constructed by the engineer John Rennie, for the Trent and Mersey Canal company in 1797‚Äì98 to feed the Caldon Canal. The reservoir had been proposed in 1796, and would have been connected to the upper level of the Caldon Canal by a feeder, but in order to win the consent of landowners, the section below Leek was made navigable. The bill to promote the construction failed in Parliament, and there was a suggestion for a bigger scheme, involving a canal from Marple on the Peak Forest Canal to the Caldon Canal, passing through Macclesfield and Rudyard. Benjamin Outram, the engineer for the Peak Forest Canal, would have overseen the project, and again, it would have involved a reservoir at Rudyard. However, the Trent and Mersey re-submitted their bill in early 1797, and it became an Act of Parliament in March. As built, the lake is around long and wide. It was formed by creating a earth dam at the southern end of the steep wooded valley, which is faced with stone on the upstream side, to prevent erosion. A spillway, some wide, was built at the eastern side of the dam, and feeds the feeder than carries water to the Leek Branch. The main source of water supply to the lake is a feeder that runs from the headwaters of the River Dane. This was refurbished in the mid-1990s by the Waterway Recovery Group. The lake has gradually silted up, but there are problems associated with dredging it, due to a lack of access for vehicles, and English Nature's concern over the disturbance of some rare fauna. On 26 June 1846 the North Staffordshire Railway successfully took over the canal company and lake as part of one of its acts of parliament that resulted in the formation of the North Staffordshire Railway. Having acquired the lake and the land around it the railway used the land down one side as the route for its Churnet Valley Line between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter. Two stations were built, one at Rudyard village (later renamed Rudyard Lake) and one at the north end of the lake called Rudyard Lake (later renamed Cliffe Park) Because of the accessibility brought by the railway stations, daytrippers and tourists began visiting the lake. Visitors included John Lockwood Kipling and Alice Macdonald, the parents of Rudyard Kipling, who met there on a trip from Burslem. They liked the place so much they named their son after it. By the end of the 19th century, crowds of up to 20,000 people could visit the lake on some days. Its popularity continued into the early 20th century, and over 20,000 visitors were carried to the site on 88 trains on a particular day in 1913. Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel, entertained crowds by demonstrating his swimming in the lake, and Carlos Trower (\\"the African Blondin\\") performed a tightrope walk across the lake.The African Blondin - Performances Accessed 9 May 2016 Attractions The lake is home to Rudyard Lake Sailing Club and North Staffordshire Rowing Club. Fishing, walking, canoeing and boat trips are popular attractions.Rudyard Lake official website ‚Äì Activities Accessed 16 July 2012 The lake has a visitor centre, toilets and an activity centre which can be hired for functions or conferences. An annual lake festival is held on a Sunday in August and a firework display takes place in November. The Rudyard Lake Steam Railway runs narrow gauge steam trains that operate up the east side of the lake on many days throughout the year. It is possible to walk round the lake or walk part way and start/finish the journey by steam train. Top Gear episode The BBC's motoring show Top Gear held a challenge at the lake in 2006 to see which presenter had designed the best amphibious car. Richard Hammond's attempt sank while Jeremy Clarkson's attempt capsized with Richard on board at the end of the challenge. However, James May's Triumph Herald, complete with sail and mast, performed well, despite the almost total absence of wind, and he was able to drive it out of the water, thus winning the challenge.

A tourist trolley, also called a road trolley, is a rubber-tired bus designed to resemble an old-style streetcar or tram, usually with false clerestory roof. The vehicles are usually fueled by diesel, or sometimes compressed natural gas. The name refers to the American English usage of the word trolley to mean an electric streetcar. As these vehicles are not actually trolleys, and to avoid confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as \\"trolley-replica buses\\".  Use  Tourist trolleys are used by both municipal and private operators. Municipal operators may mix tourist trolleys in with the regular service bus fleet to add more visitor interest or attract attention to new routes. In many cities tourist trolleys are used as circulators.A circulator operates a simplified route limited to popular destinations on a fixed schedule with a reduced or free fare. See ref [1] for definition. Tourist trolleys are also run by private operators to carry tourists to popular destinations. In San Francisco, tourist trolleys mimic the city's famous cable cars.

While not yet a continuous trail, relying on road walks in some areas, it nevertheless takes in many of the popular hiking attractions west of the Hudson River, such as the New Jersey Palisades, Harriman State Park, the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains. It offers hikers a diversity of environments to pass through, from suburbia and sea-level salt marshes along the Hudson to wilderness and boreal forest on Catskill summits in elevation. When conceived in the 1930s, it was to be the antithesis of a hiking trail, with neither a designated route nor blazes, simply a list of points of interest hikers could find their own routes to. However, increasing development after World War II in Orange and Rockland counties made that less workable, and it was revived in the 1960s as a standard trail. Plans call for it to be extended through the Adirondacks to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. History=Conception= Vincent Joseph Schaefer, a scientist who worked in Schenectady for General Electric, began to imagine a \\"hiker's route\\" from New York City to the Adirondacks shortly after helping to found the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club in 1929. He was very clear on one thing: that it not be marked as a trail. \\"Schaefer envisioned resourceful hikers making use of what they found along the way,\\" say historians Guy and Laura Waterman ‚Äî whether hikers' trails, back roads, abandoned wood roads, tow paths, creek beds, game trails, plus occasional bushwhacks where that appeared to offer the most interesting route.\\" They quote him describing the Long Path as: > ...[A] route that a person having good \\"woods\\" sense could use to move > across a region using compass and \\"topo\\" map, and that in a meandering way > would lead such persons to most of the interesting scenic vistas, rock > formations, choice or unique vegetation, historical sites and similar items > that a certain type of outdoors person enjoys. He wrote to an official at Harriman that: > There would be no cutting or blazing, for this trail would be a truly wild > walk that wouldn't erode the land or scar the solitude ... and each found > site would be an adventure in orienteering. =Implementation= He named his idea the Long Path after Walt Whitman's line about \\"the long brown path that leads wherever I choose\\" from his poem \\"Song of the Open Road\\". Since that was also where Raymond H. Torrey, the New York Post influential hiking columnist, had gotten the name for his column, it was a smart public relations choice. Torrey, who had done much to get the Appalachian Trail built, both physically and in print, in the New York metropolitan area the previous decade, announced the idea in a column in 1933. Another strong advocate in the early days was a transplanted Coloradan, W. W. Cady, who came to be identified with the Long Path almost as much as Schaefer. He and Torrey, who devoted a series of columns to it the next year, scouted a \\"trail\\" from the city to the Catskills, while Schaefer and his brother did the same for the northern half. Several alternative endpoints were envisioned: the \\"History\\" chapter of the Guide to the Long Path places the end at Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack High Peaks, but Torrey's column of August 21, 1934 places the terminus at the Adirondak Loj at Lake Clear of Heart (now called Heart Lake). The column further discusses possible extensions: a route over Wallface Mountain to join the Northville-Placid Trail by way of Henderson Lake and the Preston Ponds; a climb over Mount Van Hoevenberg and traverse of the Sentinel Range Wilderness Area to emerge at Jay, New York; and possible routes to the Canadian border, either to the Thousand Islands to the west or along the Chateaugay River to the north. Curiously, Schaefer's account in Torrey's column never mentions Whiteface as a possible ending point. To Schaefer, once this route was scouted, it was finished, per his concept ... \\"(it) exist(s) as soon as the route had been field explored and then marked on a topo map, and so had become available to the person who appreciates such things.\\" However, very few of these people could be counted among the hiking community of the day, to whom a trail was something to follow, and they had difficulty grasping the concept that the trail was open. Schaefer and hiking club pal Al Getz followed the Long Path from Schenectady to Edward's Hill in the southern Adirondacks, near Bakers Mills, New York, in the late 1930s, but as Schaefer and Cady became involved in the war effort and drifted away from the hiking community, the idea of the Long Path as originally conceived quickly became part of history. =Resurrection= In 1960, Robert Jessen of the Ramapo Ramblers hiking club, and another city-based hiker, Michael Warren, revived the idea. Since Rockland and Orange counties had become more developed even then, they abandoned the original concept of an unmarked route and pushed instead a conventional trail, although it had to make use of road routes. Over the next two decades they were successful in establishing a continuous trail from the George Washington Bridge to the southern Catskills, helped by a major relocation of the trail up Peekamoose Mountain and its continuation over Peekamoose's neighbor, Table Mountain (which previously had no established trails), crossing the east branch of the Neversink River and enabling a link with the existing Catskill trail system. The Catskill route was finally completed in 1987 when a trail was built connecting the snowmobile loop around Kaaterskill High Peak to Palenville. A further missing link, from the Sam's Point Preserve in the Shawangunks to VerKeerderkill Falls, was cut a decade later. In 1991, Vince Schaefer prepared a guide to the Long Path north (LPN) section, consisting of a set of five sets of short descriptions of 80+ \\"Landmarks\\" with accompanying topographic map locations. The guide was crafted as a hiker's pocket-sized book, entitled Field Guide to the Landmarks of the Long Path of New York: Northern Section -- Gilboa to Whiteface Mt., prepared by Vincent J Schaefer 1931-1991 with the original route and philosophy. Schaefer's son, James M. Schaefer, joined the Long Path North Hiking Club Trail Committee, sharing sets of letters, sketches and plans from his father's files to push the Long Path into the 21st century. With members of the club, a route was set, landmarks were located by Global Positioning System, and digital photos were established for 80-plus places that Schaefer reckoned to be worthy of attention. On the ground, a low-volume road walk was located through Albany, Schenectady and Saratoga counties, crossing the Helderbergs and the Rotterdam Hills to the Mohawk River. The LPN connected to county and state parks whenever possible and had a goal of relocating sections \\"off- road\\". Across the Mohawk the Long Path coursed into the Glenville Hills, with a major off-road section atop Wolf Hollow. As it reached the (southern) Adirondack Blue Line, just north of Lake Desolation, the Long Path took on a \\"Forever-Wild\\" character, becoming a bushwhack, a landmark-to-landmark trek through the southern and central park into the High Peaks, following log roads, existing trails, and low volume roads to eventually reach the top of Whiteface Mountain, with its climate observation tower ‚Äî SUNY's \\"Schaefer Observatory\\" of 1980 Olympic fame ‚Äî as the last cached location of the Long Path. In summary, the Long Path has become a hybrid trail. A 70-year-old first ‚Äî an ecologically sensitive \\"path\\" from high density urban centers, across the spectacular Eastern New York high country, to the remote, serene, and untampered wilderness. The blazed of the LP are tailor-made for the traditional blazed-trail hiker, the low-volume road-walk affords the physically challenged with a way to appreciate semi-wild places accompanied by culturally, geologically and historic way-side landmarks. And for the woods savvy hiker, the bushwhacks through the last of the Long Path capture Vince Schaefer's original vision ‚Äî a tramp across short distances using 'dead- reckoning, modern point-to-point \\"geocaching\\" and sheer map reading, orienteering skills'. 75 years after the thought, a \\"Long Brown Path\\" exists. =Expansion= As the lower trail neared completion to the northern boundary of Catskill Park at Route 23 in Windham in 1985, H. Neil Zimmerman of the New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Trail Conference renewed interest in the Adirondack connection. The Long Path North Hiking Club was formed, and after some negotiations with area landowners of trail were opened in 1990. By the middle of the decade, it would extend north of its former terminus, to the Indian Ladder in John Boyd Thacher State Park. In the early 2000s, a further were opened and blazed to Route 146, and informal road blazes existed from there to the Mohawk and the Adirondack Park Blue Line. Today right Perhaps reflecting its origins as a trail that wasn't really a trail, the Long Path in the early 21st century is a work in progress, continually evolving even in those places where it has long been a presence. Relocations continue to be made and new sections opened. The central Catskills have seen the greatest activity. In 1999, trail crews completed work on a section starting at the Willow Trail near the summit of Mount Tremper near Phoenicia, descending down into the neighboring valley and then over \\"Edgewood Mountain\\" into Silver Hollow Notch, where it follows an old road down to Route 214. This section eliminated a lengthy road walk to Willow, albeit at the price of a road walk into Stony Clove Notch. However, this added Plateau Mountain to the trail route, and pending future approval from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and an amendment to the Unit Management Plan for the Indian Head Wilderness Area, a new section will be built to follow a ridge from Silver Hollow Notch to the Devil's Path on Plateau and eliminate that road walk. Not long afterwards, the state purchased the former Lundy estate in the vicinity of Kerhonkson, straddling the Catskill Park Blue Line near the southern tip of the park. The new property, once occupied by an owner of Lundy's Restaurant, is to become a state forest outside the park and a new Wild Forest within it. It will also allow for the relocation of the Long Path off roads to follow the Vernooy Kill. The relocation would rejoin the present Long Path route at Vernooy Falls west of Riggsville in the Ulster County township of Rochester. In late 2001, the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development allowed the construction of a new trail across its Platte Clove Preserve. It was added to the Long Path, and allowed for a rerouting of the route along existing trails to take in Indian Head Mountain and its stunning views of the Hudson Valley, as well as eliminating a road walk that previously existed. In 2007 the road walk on Route 214 was eliminated. Volunteers extended the Warner Creek Trail with a direct connection between Silver hollow Notch and Plateau Mountain. This created a section of trail between Phoenicia and Platte Clove without any road crossings. To the south of Phoenicia, from the Burroughs Range Trail near Wittenberg Mountain, a new section of trail has been constructed for the Long Path. This route crosses Cross Mountain, Mount Pleasant and Romer Mountain. It comes out on Lane Street in Phoenicia. This section opened on Trails Day June 7, 2014. This has eliminated the more than road walk out of Woodland Valley State Campground. All these changes have combined or will to make the of Long Path in the Catskill Park almost entirely off-road. In the Shawangunks, new agreements with landowners and/or changes in ownership have also made eliminations of road walks possible. Further south, in heavily suburbanized Rockland County, where some road walks are now mostly unavoidable, the county's Planning Board has made the Long Path route an area of special attention and one of its spines for open space preservation efforts, trying to convince its local counterparts to protect the corridor. North of the Catskills, the Long Path North Committee continues its efforts to bypass road walks and route the trail into more wooded areas, particularly the small state forests in Schoharie County. The main problem the trail faces there, ironically, is under-use. Some sections just north of the Catskill Park are getting overgrown and only the blazes remain to indicate the trail. Increasing public awareness of the trail and promoting use of various sections continues to be a concern. Lastly, in 2015 the southern end of the trail was moved to New York City, to the 175th Street subway station in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. =The Orange County problem= From the earliest days of the Long Path one of the most difficult issues has been how to get the trail across northern Orange County as a footpath. Between Schunemunk Mountain and the Shawangunks lies the broad valley of the Wallkill River and the many lowlands within, then heavily farmed and now heavily developed. Major progress has been made in Orange County. In 2012 almost half of the of road walking in Orange County were eliminated by relocating the Long Path onto the Heritage Trail, an Orange County rail-trail. Leaving the rail trail in New Hampton, the trail follows rural roads to the Shawangunk Ridge in Greenville. The online guide suggests that it might be a pleasant route for bicycling. There is hope for moving more of the trail off the roads of western Orange County. South of I-84 still needs to be explored as farms, town parks, conservation easements and even an abandoned rail bed are all possibly available. North of I-84 also needs to be explored as it contains farms, conservation easements and watershed land for both Orange County and the city of Middletown. =The Shawangunk Ridge Trail= One way of solving the Orange County problem, avoiding it entirely, came out the joint efforts of the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference and the National Park Service. In 1989, they conducted a feasibility study on the idea of abandoning northern Orange County altogether and simply having the trail follow the Appalachian Trail from the junction in Harriman to High Point State Park in northwestern New Jersey, where a new trail would then be constructed to link up with the current LP along the ridge near Wurtsboro. The result was the Shawangunk Ridge Trail, a connector which drew on a possible AT relocation that had first been considered in 1965, before the National Scenic Trails Act made it possible to protect the existing route. The SRT starts at the Appalachian Trail in High Point State Park in New Jersey. The Long Path meets up with the SRT after , and the two trails run together for the next . At times it hugs the base of the ridge in some areas due to land-access issues, and has some road walks, but these are slowly being eliminated. The low-lying route in Sullivan County actually is something of a blessing, as it allows hikers to take in the magnificent Basha Kill Wildlife Management Area. The AT-SRT detour is the route currently recommended by the Trail Conference for anyone considering a thru-hike of the LP, due to its better capacity for camping and fewer road walks, despite the additional it adds to the trip. However, if doing the Long Path as individual day hikes, it is best to remain on the main trail. Taking the AT one misses the entire north end of Harriman State Park, Schunemunk Mountain and the Heritage Trail. Management The Long Path is under the purview of the Trail Conference, which divides it geographically into three sections: *The Long Path South Committee for the areas south of the Catskills *the existing Catskill Trails Committee for the Catskills *and The Long Path North Committee. As the areas under the jurisdiction of the latter are somewhat beyond the Trail Conference's usual reach in the Greater New York area, the Long Path North Committee functions somewhat independently. In the future, when the trail begins to extend into the Adirondacks, it is likely that the Adirondack Mountain Club or some other group based in the region will have management responsibilities for those sections. Marking Shawangunks Throughout most of its length, whether on or off the road, the Long Path is indicated by a aqua blaze. In some areas where blazes have not been repainted in some time, older light blue blazes may be found, but the distinctive aqua (sometimes referred to, incorrectly, in some guidebooks as teal) indicates the Long Path, and only the Long Path. In the Catskills and the state forests on the Shawangunk Ridge, the trail uses official NYSDEC markers ‚Äî blue in the Shawangunks, and whatever color is used for the particular trail in the Catskills the LP follows. Markers with the Long Path logo (see above), either in aqua or blue (if older), can sometimes be found on signage at junctions where the LP changes trails. The mile-long trail through the Catskill Center's Platte Clove Preserve follows green diamond-shaped metal markers with the Center's logo on it. Finally, the section in Thacher State Park follows aqua plastic markers with the LP logo. The Shawangunk Ridge Trail uses either the aqua blazes or blue NYSDEC markers, depending on whether it is on public or private land. End-to-end When it began to be established as a marked trail, the Long Path was not built with an eye toward being \\"thru-hiked\\" in one continuous trip, as it was more a backbone for creating hiking opportunities in areas which did not yet have them and thus ideal for day trips or short overnights. The Trail Conference did give out rockers for those who completed a tally sheet of trips made on different dates. The trail, even with the AT/Shawangunk Ridge detour available, was difficult for those from out of the region who would need access to maildrops and places to sleep in the areas where camping is not permitted. After several dozen hikers had earned these, it was perhaps inevitable that someone would be the Earl Shaffer of the Long Path, and on May 30, 1998, Mary Ann Nissley of Chalfont, Pennsylvania, a woman with experience hiking many long-distance trails, completed the first Long Path thru-hike in 25 days. Several others have followed since. The Long Path Guide The current Long Path guidebook now has information on nearby post offices, motels and other things useful for those contemplating a thru-hike. On May 24, 2005, trail runner David O'Neill, the founder of Charity Runners Inc., finished the first thru-run of the Long Path, as a benefit for the Trail Conference. He had started on the first of the month; his time of 24 days is the current record for fastest journey up the Long Path. (This included five days where he rested and allowed injuries to heal, and one day he did as a normal hike.) On May 13, 2006, O'Neill repeated the benefit thru-run and became the first to complete a thru-run of the Long Path using the AT-SRT detour. He started on the first of the month and completed the journey in 12 days, 5 hours, and 17 minutes. In 2009, Jacob Aronson fulfilled Vincent Schaefer's original concept of hiking from the George Washington Bridge to Schaefer Observatory atop Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. He arrived in Altamont, New York, on July 6 to complete his thru-hike of the Long Path in 27 days. Using a combination of road walks and the Northville-Placid Trail, he made his way from Altamont to Lake Placid, where he climbed nearby Whiteface Mountain on July 25, 46 days after he began hiking. On July 26, 2013 Daniel J. Rosenthal of Sunderland, Vermont, became the first person to complete a southbound thru-hike on the trail. On September 3, 2013, Kenneth Posner of New York City completed a through-run using the Long Path's 2012 re-route on the Schunemunk Ridge in Orange County, along the Orange Heritage Trail, and to the Shawangunk Ridge Trail in Greenville. His run was mostly self-supported (for the first ); he put food/supply caches at six points along the route, and slept on the ground (on a sleep mat) at places along the trailside. It took him nine days to complete the entire trail, the current record. Route=Fort Lee to Harriman State Park= Currently, from its new beginning just slightly south of the old one, the LP goes over the bridge approach and then a pedestrian bridge over a ramp from the bridge to the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After that, it enters the park along the cliff edges that it will remain in for the next to the state line, running through the woods next to Palisades Parkway at times and even passing through some of its rest stops and parking areas. Once past the stone monument at the state line, it briefly dips back into New Jersey, then moves closer to U.S. Route 9W near Columbia University's Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory, then heading for Tallman Mountain State Park, where it climbs the eponymous feature, then descends to the trail's lowest elevation, a mere above sea level as it crosses Sparkill Creek on a wooden bridge. Climbing and crossing Route 9W again, it passes through the low hills in and near two county parks as it climbs up toward Blauvelt State Park, then drops into Nyack, where it crosses the New York State Thruway for the first time. After passing through Mountainview County Nature Park, it follows 9W for a mile or so, then leaves it for Hook Mountain State Park and its dramatic views over the Hudson's Haverstraw Bay. It then drops down to the small Haverstraw Beach State Park and follows a road out of it into High Tor State Park, where the bare summit of the tor, the highest peak of the Palisades at , affords the best views of this section of the Hudson Valley. After High Tor, it stays on the ridge of South Mountain County Park as it curves away from the river, toward a crossing of the Palisades Parkway, US 202 and NY 45 in Mount Ivy. Again, the trail follows along in the woods along the parkway's right of way until it can enter Cheesecote Town Park. After that, it's a short road walk that finally allows the trail to enter Harriman State Park. =Harriman to the Shawangunks= The trail meanders through this southern part of the park, briefly joining with the cross-park Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail, passing St.-John's-in-the- Wilderness Church, and finally reaching Seven Lakes Drive at Lake Skannatati. North of there, it briefly joins the Dunning Trail and wanders among the ruins of an abandoned iron mine and joins the Arden-Surebridge Trail at the junction colloquially called \\"Times Square\\". Leaving it to run alongside Dismal Swamp, it crosses the Appalachian Trail not long afterwards, then continues north towards the Lake Cohasset Shelter where camping is permitted. It then runs along the crest of Stockbridge Mountain, passing the Stockbridge and Stockbridge Cave Shelters, and afterwards works its way down to US 6 by way of a fire road. Torrey Memorial on Long Mountain It follows an access road into a parking area, then climbs up Long Mountain to a memorial in honor of and at a favorite view of Raymond H. Torrey, who did much to make the trail possible. Then it heads westward, skirting at times the boundary of the United States Military Academy (West Point) property, crossing NY 293 and following it and later Route 6 closely in neighboring woods until it can finally leave Harriman Park behind and drop down to local roads in the Central Valley area, cross the Thruway again, then along Woodbury Creek on a dirt road to NY 32 and Schunemunk Mountain. On Schunemunk, it ascends some subsidiary knobs with sweeping views of the whole area, and then follows the Jessup Trail southwest, where it passes commanding view across the Moodna and Wallkill valleys, and then drops off to Gonzaga Park, which bring it past the Orange and Rockland Lakes, then across Route 17 to the Heritage Trail. Following this rail trail, it passes many nice wetlands, the Black Dirt Farms in Chester, and through the historic village of Goshen. Leaving the rail trail it follows local back roads over the Wallkill River and into the town of Wawayanda. Crossing I-84 the road walk reaches Mountain Road in Greenville and ends at the Shawangunk Ridge. Cross the ridge on a recently preserved parcel joining the Shawangunk Ridge Trail. =Shawangunks and southern Catskills= The trail stays on the west side of the ridgeline, following an abandoned rail bed that once crossed the mountain. Leaving the rail bed at Route 211, the trail passes through a state forest parcel and crosses into Sullivan County where it passes through the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area. The trail reaches the village of Wurtsboro, then climbs back up to the ridgecrest and mostly follows it, as it works its way into Ulster County. The trail briefly follows an old dirt turnpike which runs parallel to and below NY 52 as it descends toward South Gully, then climbs up to Sam's Point through the South Gully, following South Gully Brook at times. After following some of the old dirt roads from the days when the nearby ice caves were a tourist attraction, the trail follows a path through the dwarf pine forest to VerKeerderkill Falls. This section has been identified as their favorite by many who have hiked much or all of the Long Path, as the shortness of the trees gives a feeling of being above tree line and allows for constant views of the ridge ahead and behind, the Mid-Hudson valley to one side and the Catskills to the other. The falls themselves are a unique sight. After the falls the trail crosses High Point and Smiley Carriageway, then descends through Mine Hole to Berme Road. After crossing Berme Road, the trail follows the D & H Canal towpath, to the hamlet of Port Ben. It then crosses Rondout Creek and US 209, following little-traveled local roads from there to the Catskill Park Blue Line. Shortly after entering the Catskills, it reaches the Vernooy Kill Falls, another popular day trip. It then climbs over Bangle Hill in the Sundown Wild Forest and descends steeply to an undeveloped state campground at Bull Run. A reroute through the Vernooy Kill State Forest, originally planned to open in 2016, will significantly reduce the road walk through this area. As of February 2020, the new route has not yet been completed. One of the most challenging sections of the Long Path is ahead as it meets its first two Catskill High Peaks, climbing more than in to the summit of Peekamoose Mountain, then cresting neighboring Table Mountain after a brief dip. Slide Mountain, highest point on the Long Path From there it drops down to cross the East Branch of the Neversink River and then back up again slightly to a junction with the Phoenicia-East Branch Trail and the east end of the Finger Lakes Trail. It follows the Phoenicia-East Branch Trail up to a col to the east of Wildcat Mountain, then up the beautiful Curtis-Ormsbee Trail to the summit ridge of Slide Mountain, where the Burroughs Range Trail takes it a short distance to the highest peak in the Catskills and the highest point on the LP, approximately above sea level. It makes a rough descent over Cornell and Wittenberg mountains down to Cross Mountain, crosses the ridge- line of Cross Mountain, then passes just below the summit of Mount Pleasant and across Romer Mountain, then follows the road out to Phoenicia. =Central and northern Catskills= Crossing NY 28 and going through Phoenicia, an oasis of civilization amid the mountains, the Long Path follows a road east out of town to the trailhead for Mount Tremper, where it follows the old road up to the fire tower, which offers splendid views of the entire region. Continuing on down to Warners Creek and then up Edgewood Mountain, where views north have been cut, it drops down again via Silver Hollow Notch to ascend Daley Ridge, joining the Devil's Path, perhaps the most challenging and rewarding trail in the Catskills, west of the summit of Plateau. It follows the Devil's Path across Plateau, Sugarloaf, Twin and Indian Head mountains down to the Platte Clove Preserve, then makes a brief road walk to the Kaaterskill High Peak snowmobile trail. On the north side of that peak, the Long Path descends more than via a zigzag route past several waterfalls to Palenville, crosses NY 23A, then goes back up the other side of Kaaterskill Clove via the Old Overlook Road to the Escarpment Trail, the site of the legendary Catskill Mountain House, North‚ÄìSouth Lake State Campground, and finally up to North Mountain with its inspiring views back over the Escarpment and the lakes. Eventually the trail tops out on Stoppel Point near an old wrecked plane, then drops down into Dutcher Notch and then back up to a ridge culminating in a steep ascent up Blackhead Mountain and its summit, then down again to Acra Point, Burnt Knob and finally Windham High Peak, the northernmost of the Catskill High Peaks. Descending leisurely to NY 23, it leaves the Catskill Park but not the Catskills, as it immediately goes over several ranges of peaks to Ashland Pinnacle. A side trail, a former route of the Long Path, continues to Huntersfield Mountain, where NYSDEC has cut some views near the summit. View of Albany area from Thacher Park =The Long Path North= From Ashland Pinnacle, the trail makes its way via a combination of roads, woodlots and field edges to Schoharie Reservoir, crosses the Schoharie Creek and enters the county of the same name. First stop is Mine Kill State Park and its waterfall, then the trail crosses through the woods to Lansing Manor at the Blenheim- Gilboa Power Project. continues via Burnt-Rossman Hills, Mallet Pond and Patria state forests on the other side, then up NY 30 to Vroman's Nose, a popular local hike. Afterwards, it recrosses the Schoharie into the village of Middleburgh and follows NY 145 briefly to climb the Middleburgh cliffs, then makes its way across Cotton Hill and Dutch Settlement state forests to Albany County, where it takes in the Partridge Run Wildlife Management Area, Cole Hill State Forest, and the Helderberg Escarpment, which it follows north through John Boyd Thacher State Park, with its Indian Ladder. Currently Thacher State Park is the end of the trail for end-to-enders, but a partially off-road route has been blazed across the Mohawk River at Lock 9 park to the Saratoga County line, and from there a road walk is described to the Northville-Placid Trail within the Adirondack Park.

She got her start on All My Children as a prot√©g√©e of the show's creator, Agnes Nixon. She went on to serve four different stints as its Head Writer, ultimately earning her four Daytime Emmy awards in that capacity. Broderick's work on the show has often been met with critical acclaim, citing her as its finest head writer outside of Nixon. She was the last head writer of All My Children's 40-year broadcast run on ABC, penning the show through its network finale on September 23, 2011. Bio Lorraine Broderick graduated from Andover High School in 1966 and Mt. Holyoke College in 1970. She joined All My Children as scriptwriter and breakdown writer in 1979, under the guidance of then-head writer Agnes Nixon. In 1982, Broderick would promote to an Associate Head Writer alongside fellow Nixon prot√©g√©e Wisner Washam, who himself would be promoted to Head Writer the following year. In 1986, Broderick was appointed Co-Head Writer, sharing duties with Washam, who would exit the show himself in 1987 ‚Äì leaving Broderick as the sole head writer. Broderick won her first Outstanding Writing Team Daytime Emmy award as head writer alongside Washam in 1988. However, a network mandate for creative changes had Broderick demoted back to Associate Head Writer, when Margaret DePriest was appointed head writer of All My Children in early 1989. But DePriest would not last long in the position, as Agnes Nixon would resume head writing duties by the end of that year ‚Äì once again with Broderick and a returned Wisner Washam as her Associate Head Writers. After 12 years with All My Children's writing team, Broderick left in 1991 to become the co-head writer of Guiding Light. While Broderick wrote for Guiding Light, the show received much critical acclaim, and the early 1990s are widely considered to have been a golden era for the show. In the spring of 1995, when Megan McTavish was fired from her writing post at All My Children, Broderick left her post as Associate Head Writer of Another World to once again become AMC's head writer. Broderick would win three consecutive Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Writing Team from her work as head writer of the show, bringing her total to four Emmy honors as a daytime head writer. She left All My Children for the second time in December 1997 when ABC Daytime decided to bring back McTavish. In early 1998, Broderick was hired at CBS Daytime's As the World Turns where her most notable story was the resurrection of evil David Stenbeck and the switch of Lily Snyder's baby with another baby. In July 1999, a complete behind-the-scenes overhaul at the show led to Broderick's exit. Shortly after, she was hired by Days of Our Lives Executive Producer Ken Corday to helm his show's writing team. However, she was there for less than a month before she left over disagreements with Co-Executive Producer Tom Langan (who would assume the writing duties himself). Reportedly, Langan wanted to rapidly age the next generation of teens and immediately place them in front-burner storylines, while Broderick wanted to phase them in gradually; Broderick's character-driven storytelling style was also reportedly not favored by Langan, who preferred more outlandish plotting. Broderick then joined Port Charles as an Associate Head Writer, before being appointed head writer of One Life to Live in January 2001. In 2003, she was demoted to associate head writer upon the return of famed One Life to Live writing team Michael Malone and Josh Griffith. At that time, ABC Daytime President Brian Frons offered Broderick a return to the head writing duties at All My Children, but she declined. Broderick left One Life to Live altogether in 2004, returning to Guiding Light for a short stint as Associate Head Writer, during the show's transition to a new head writing team. She would eventually accept a position as a screenwriting and playwriting professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This move reunited her with her former colleague, Felicia Minei Behr, former executive producer of All My Children and As the World Turns, who served at Drexel as a professor of film & TV production. In November 2009, Broderick returned to All My Children at the request of her one-time mentor, Agnes Nixon ‚Äì following the dismissal of outgoing head writer Charles Pratt Jr. ‚Äì as part of ABC's concerted effort to increased ratings. However, Broderick once again passed on being head writer in a permanent capacity. On January 13, 2010, ABC announced David Kreizman and Donna Swajeski as the new head writers. Broderick would continue as the interim head writer until her successors were in place on March 15, 2010. She then assumed her duties as Associate Head Writer. On April 2, 2011, amid rumors of All My Children's possible cancellation, Soaps in Depth broke the news via Twitter that Broderick was once again named the show's head writer, replacing Kreizman and Swajeski. The show's cancellation was announced just two weeks later, with Broderick writing the show through its conclusion on September 23, 2011. She then returned to One Life to Live as a breakdown writer until that show's finale on January 13, 2012. In April 2012, it was confirmed that Broderick would join the team of new Days of our Lives co-head writers Gary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell as a breakdown writer.

Born Maria Susanne Luise von Degenfeld in Strasbourg, she was the daughter of an impoverished baron, Martens-Christof von Degenfeld and his wife, Maria Anna Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden. In 1650 she was appointed a lady-in-waiting at the Electoral Palace at Heidelberg to Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, the consort of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine. He was the son and heir of Frederick V, the \\"Winter King\\" of Bohemia, by Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England. Marriage Although the marriage of the Elector and Electress was notoriously unhappy, Charlotte openly protesting that it had been contracted against her will, Luise initially declined to become the Elector's mistress. On 6 January 1658, acting on his own sovereign authority, the Prince-Elector contracted a morganatic but arguably bigamous (cf. cuius regio, eius religio) second marriage with the young Baroness von Degenfeld at Schwetzingen Castle, then a hunting lodge, midway between Heidelberg and Mannheim, Germany. From 31 December 1667 the Prince-Elector and his court accorded Luise the title of \\"the Raugravine\\" (Raugrafin), and the corresponding titles of Raugrave/Raugravine without territorial suffix, to each of her children, distinguishing them from the children of his first, dynastic marriage (which the Electress always refused to acknowledge as legally terminated), the future Elector Palatine Charles II and the future Duchess of Orl√©ans, Elisabeth Charlotte (\\"Liselotte\\"). Children Thirteen children were born to the Elector and the Raugravine between October 1658 and April 1675. The only one of her children to marry and have children was the Raugravine Caroline Elisabeth (1659-1696), who married an ardent suitor, Meinhard, 3rd Duc de Schomberg, 1st Duke of Leinster in 1683, receiving 20,000 florins from Elector Charles II. When the Edict of Nantes was revoked in France, the Schombergs emigrated to England rather than convert to Catholicism. Three of Luise's sons were killed in battle, and one was killed in a duel. The youngest, the Raugrave Karl-Moritz (1671-1702), was a favorite of his half-sister, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate (referred to as Madame), and visited her several times at the French court, once seeking to provoke a duel with her husband's lover and major-domo, the Chevalier de Lorraine. Madame's efforts to intervene on his behalf to obtain an appanage from her brother, the Elector Charles II, were rebuffed. Thus the impecunious and alcoholic Karl-Moritz died unmarried, last of the Wittelsbach raugraves. On 26 February 1677, Charles I Louis invested his two elder sons by Luise von Degenfeld, the Raugraves Karl-Ludwig and Karl-Eduard, with the lordship of Stebbach in Kraichgau. A portion of this estate had belonged in fief to the von Gemmingen family since 1577. When it came in its entirety to the Elector Palatine in 1677 under the administration of the city of Hilsbach, he transferred his rights therein to the two raugraves. Charles I died in 1680, followed by his son and heir by his first wife, Charles II, in 1685. The new Elector Palatine Philip William of Neuburg, a distant, Catholic relative, seized Stebbach upon Karl-Eduard's death in 1690. But in addition to several daughters, Charles I still had a living son of his second marriage, Raugrave Karl-Moritz. Thanks to the protests of his maternal uncle, Baron Ferdinand von Degenfeld, the estate was deeded over to Karl-Moritz, the last raugrave, on 27 September 1695. Stebbach was again seized by the Elector Palatine upon the latter's death in 1702. A successful appeal against this act was made, this time on behalf of the two surviving daughters of Charles I and Luise von Degenfeld, the Raugravines Louise (1661-1733) and Amalia (1663-1709), the former of whom managed the estates of her brother-in-law, the renowned general Meinhard, 3rd Duc de Schomberg, 1st Duke of Leinster. =List= The children of Luise and the Elector Palatine Charles I Louis were: * Charles Louis (15 October 1658 - 12 August 1688), killed in action; * Caroline Elisabeth (19 November 1659 - 28 June 1696), married Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg, had four children, including Frederica Mildmay, Countess of M√©rtola; * Louise (25 January 1661 - 6 February 1733); * Louis (19 February 1662 - 7 April 1662); * Amalia Elisabeth (1 April 1663 - 13 July 1709); * George Louis (30 March 1664 - 20 July 1665); * Frederica (7 July 1665 - 7 August 1674); * Frederick William (25 November 1666 - 29 July 1667); * Charles Edward (19 May 1668 - 2 January 1690), killed in action; * Sophie (19 July 1669 - 28 November 1669); * Charles Maurice (9 January 1671 - 13 June 1702); * Charles August (19 October 1672 - 20 September 1691), killed in action; * Charles Casimir (1 May 1675 - 28 April 1691), killed in a duel. Later life Initially Luise and the Elector continued to live under one roof with his first wife, who refused to abandon the palace. But the latter's resistance to the arrangement led to such numerous quarrels that the Elector eventually sent her back to her own family in Hesse. However, Electress Charlotte's two children remained with their father. Although his eldest daughter, Liselotte, got along well with her step- mother and younger half-siblings, the rancor between her parents eventually prompted her father's sister, Sophia, to invite Liselotte to come live with her at the court of her husband, the future Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover. Although relations with his second wife would not always remain free of conflict, Charles and Luise had a large progeny together and the Elector proved a doting father to all of his children. Nonetheless, in later years poor relations developed between him and his eldest son, the extremely devout Electoral Prince Charles, which apparently prevented him from entertaining the warm feelings for the Raugravine's children that his sister Liselotte felt to such an extent that she sustained an extensive, now published, correspondence with several of her half-sisters for the remainder of her life at the court of Versailles. During her 14th pregnancy the Raugravine Luise died in the castle of Friedrichsburg in Mannheim on 28 March 1677. Her widower married a third time in December 1679, again morganatically, to Elisabeth Hollander von Bernau (1659-8 March 1702), by whom he had a posthumous son, Charles Louis, in April 1681 who, however, died young. In 1733 the still unmarried Louise died, whereupon one of the Raugravine's English granddaughters, Lady Maria von Schomberg (1692-1762), who had married a cousin, Count Christopher von Degenfeld-Schonberg (1689-1762), inherited Stebbach. The estate remained henceforth among the properties of the Degenfeld-Schonberg counts, even after the town's merger with Gemmingen in 1974.

Early career Burnett began his radio career while in the Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf in 1964. In 1966 he joined offshore radio station, Radio 270,BBC Inside Out - Yorkshire & Lincolnshire: Monday 18 October 2004 broadcasting off Scarborough, North Yorkshire. After the banning of the offshore stations he moved in 1967 to Manx Radio on the Isle of Man, but he soon joined Radio Luxembourg, where he hosted the chart show. Here Burnett discovered many recordings, previously thought lost, of propaganda broadcasts by William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw Haw\\") to Britain, made from the Luxembourg stations during the Nazi occupation. On Luxembourg, he presented the Saturday Top 20 show from 1967 to 1974. On 24 March 1974 Burnett joined BBC Radio 1 hosting a Sunday morning show All There Is To Hear (a radio one airplay chart show) and sitting in on the station's national Top 20 show. The first record he ever played on the station was Seven Seas Of Rhye by the group Queen. In 1976, an on-air parody of the U.S. hit single \\"Convoy\\", became \\"Convoy GB\\" (by Laurie Lingo & The Dipsticks), which led to a release of the song as a single along with fellow DJ Dave Lee Travis. The song reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart, and Burnett appeared dressed as a chicken on Top Of The Pops. From 5 July 1976 he hosted the weekday lunchtime show after Johnnie Walker left the station and moved to California. Here he had the responsibility of revealing the new singles chart every Tuesday lunchtime. His popular show included several features such as Pub of the Day, Fun at One and Is, Was, Should Have. Burnett became a regular presenter of Top of the Pops, and presented the Radio 1 Roadshow during the summer. In 1981 he moved from lunchtimes to later in the afternoons, but his daily show ended in 1982 to allow Steve Wright's show to be extended. During 1982-84, Burnett was heard on BBC Radio 2 as a stand-in host for the likes of David Hamilton and Terry Wogan and occasionally presenting the Early Show. From 1985 Between 1985 and 1987, he moved to Pennine Radio (now The Pulse of West Yorkshire) in Bradford, Southern Sound (now Heart Sussex) in Sussex, and Capital Radio, where he deputised for Alan Freeman on Pick of the Pops Take Two in February 1988. In October 1985, billed as the 'Pee Bee Squad' he reached #52 in the United Kingdom chart with \\"Rugged and Mean, Butch and On Screen\\". In 1988 Capital split its frequencies and he joined Capital Gold where he presented a daytime Vintage Chart programme (MondayFriday at 1pm), playing charts from 1956 to 1972. He also did a Sunday afternoon show on Capital Gold (2-5pm). This featured an hour of listeners' requests. He featured a Vintage Top 30 in the final couple of hours, playing complete top 30s again from 1956 to 1972. He left Capital Gold around 1994, and turned up on Classic Gold firstly in 1996 in an early evening show, when GWR swallowed up the Chiltern Stations. The Classic Gold platform was then broadcast on the old Chiltern Network's Supergold stations, as a replacement. This show disappeared a couple of years later. Burnett replaced Jimmy Savile as the long-time host of The Vintage Chart Show on the BBC World Service (19891999). Since 2000 He returned to Classic Gold around 2000, where he presented at lunchtimes and early afternoons. He left the station when it merged with Capital Gold to form the new Gold network in August 2007. In 2003, he was regular guest presenter on a Networked show on a few stations The UK Top 20 Rewind along with Shaun Tilley. During that run, he had to have a gallstone operation, and was off for a period. In the last week of August 2007, Burnett was heard on Big L International 1395MW Sky0190 as a replacement for afternoon DJ Steve Garlick, who was on holiday. He was due to present a regular weekend show on BigL, but this never happened. On 9 November 2007 Burnett broadcast with Dave Lee Travis on KCFM from Hull, and on 16 November 2007 he did the show as their 'Live Legend' of radio. For the following four weeks he had a three-hour weekly spot on the station - 'Burnett Live' - which broadcast live late on Friday evenings. Blackburn replaced Burnett in this slot in January 2008. However, Burnett continues to regularly broadcast on the station. He did a late evening show there, in the early Summer of 2008. Stood in, for Shaun Tilley in October 2008, and also did the 47pm slot there on Christmas Eve 2008. Burnett could be heard presenting weekdays between 5 and 7 (9 February‚ÄìSeptember 2009) on internet radio station Wight FM (this was voicetracked). He could be heard on KCFM (Hull) on Sunday afternoons between 12 and 3 between Summer 2009-Summer 2010. On Saturday 16 October 2010, he stood in for Dave Cash on BBC Radio Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Solent, Oxford and Berkshire presenting a classic chart show featuring top 40 sounds from 1971 and 1981. He also did a Christmas Eve show on Time106.6 in 2010, and another on Monday 27 December at 10am. He can now be heard from time to time on The Vintage Top 40 Show on various BBC Local Stations on Sundays at 5pm.

Through the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions of 1629, the Dutch West India Company first started to grant this title and land to some of its invested members. These inducements to foster colonization and settlement (also known as the \\"Rights and Exemptions\\") are the basis for the patroon system. In 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution, primogeniture and feudal tenure were abolished and thus patroons and manors evolved into simply large estates subject to division and leases. The deeded tracts were called patroonships and could span 16 miles in length on one side of a major river, or 8 miles if spanning both sides. In 1640, the charter was revised to cut new plot sizes in half, and to allow any Dutch American in good standing to purchase an estate. The title of patroon came with powerful rights and privileges. A patroon could create civil and criminal courts, appoint local officials and hold land in perpetuity. In return, he was required by the Dutch West India Company to ‚Äì sources vary ‚Äì establish a settlement of at least 50 families within four years on the land,http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/_Topics/history/_Texts/FISDQC/4*.html Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology or \\"ship fifty colonists to it within four year\\".http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital- exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/albany/rensselaerswijck/ As tenants working for the patroon, these first settlers were relieved of the duty of public taxes for ten years, but were required to pay rent to the patroon. A patroonship sometimes had its own village and other infrastructure, including churches. Patroons were entitled to the acquisition of enslaved labor by the Dutch West India Company's Rights and Exemptions Charter. Patroons, often the wealthiest and most influential residents of New Netherland, employed slaves in almost every part of the colony, although a majority of the slave population remained near New Amsterdam, and farther north, were centered around Fort Orange (Albany, NY) and Rensselaerwijck. Moreover, patroons were essentially the only colonists in New Netherland to own slaves. https://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital- exhibitions/slavery-exhibit/slave-labor/ After the English takeover of New Netherland in 1664 and American independence in 1783, the system continued with the granting of large tracts known as manors, and sometimes referred to as patroonships. Rensselaerswyck The largest and most successful patroonship in New Netherland was the Manor of Rensselaerswijck, established by Kiliaen van Rensselaer. Rensselaerswijck covered almost all of present-day Albany and Rensselaer counties and parts of present-day Columbia and Greene counties in New York State. * Manor of Rensselaerswyck and Lower Manor at Claverack.

After the war, the newly recognized New York state government refused to overturn the law. Rensselaerswijck was dismantled in the early 19th century after its last sole proprietor, Stephen Van Rensselaer III, died. Two of his sons split the property and, after tenant farmers gained the right to refuse to pay rent, the sons sold off much of the property.

Due to confusion with H. amboinensis, the exact distribution in the Philippines has been labelled with some uncertainty. However, a genetic study that sampled individuals throughout the Philippine archipelago (from Mindanao in south to Luzon in north) found that all were H. pustulatus, which is divided into six clades. Conservation Philippine sailfin lizards have now been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Their main threats are habitat loss, being hunted for food, and collection for the pet trade. In captivity Living in San Diego Zoo Philippine sailfin lizards were commonly available in the United States during the 1990s, but today they are now rare and expensive in the United States (costing about $650 for a captive bred juvenile). Breeding in captivity has only been done in a few cases. But because it is common in many parts of the Philippines, the pet trade in many regions still continues and some are even unrecognized by the government.

Since 1990 he has directed the Science and Human Dimension Project at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he is also, since 2009, Founder and Director of the Rustat Conferences. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (University of Leicester) in 2011. He was nominated for the PEN/Ackerley Prize for best UK memoir 2007 (Seminary Boy) and shortlisted Specialist Journalist of the Year (science, medicine in Sunday Times Magazine), British Press Awards 2006. He won the Scientific and Medical Network Book of the Year Award for Hitler's Scientists, 2005; and received the Independent Television Authority-Tablet Award for contributions to religious journalism (1994). In 1982 he won the Gold Dagger Award Non- Fiction (1982) for Earth to Earth. He is best known for his investigative journalism; memoir; and his work in public understanding of science. In addition to his books on the relationship between science, ethics and the humanities, he has written widely on the Catholic Church and the modern papacy. Early life John Cornwell was born in East Ham, London, the son of Sidney Arthur Cornwell and Kathleen Egan Cornwell. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Cornwell entered the junior seminary, Cotton College, in 1953 intending to become a priest. He later wrote a memoir of his five years at Cotton. He continued to the senior seminary, Oscott College, Sutton Coldfield, in 1958. Cornwell studied English Language and Literature at St Benet's Hall, Oxford and was tutored by Jonathan Wordsworth at Exeter College. He graduated in 1964, and went on to Christ's College, Cambridge as a graduate student. After Cambridge, Cornwell taught in East London schools, before becoming a teaching fellow in English and philosophy at McMaster University, Ontario. From 1970 to 1976 he worked as a freelance journalist, mainly for The Guardian and The Observer Magazine, with periods in Italy and Latin America as a Foreign Correspondent. In 1973 he reported from Buenos Aires, and in 1975 from Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires. From 1976 to 1988 he was on the staff at The Observer, serving on the Foreign desk and later as Editor and Manager of The Observer Foreign News Service, which he took from hard copy to high speed wire delivery worldwide. In 1982 he was appointed New Media Publisher, responsible for developing seven parallel media businesses, including creation of UK's first interactive electronic newspaper with Prestel, joint venture book publishing, and educational resources. He was The Observer‚Äôs delegate at the International Press Institute (1978‚Äì1988); investigator and rapporteur on the 20th Century Fund Task Force convened in New York and Oxford in 1978‚Äì79 on the tensions between Western free-enterprise media and government media organisations: findings and analysis published in his Free and Balanced Flow (1979). His first two books were novels: The Spoiled Priest, and Seven Other Demons. Two decades later he published a third novel, Strange Gods. In 1973 he published a critical biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Coleridge, Poet and Revolutionary, 1772‚Äì1804. In 1982 he published Earth to Earth, the story of a farming family tragedy at Winkleigh in Devon, for which he won the non-fiction Gold Dagger Award. A Thief in the Night His 1989 book A Thief in the Night investigated the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I, which was surrounded by conspiracy theories. Though Cornwell sharply criticised Vatican prelates, he concluded that the Pope was not murdered but died of a pulmonary embolism, possibly brought on by overwork and neglect. Hitler's Pope In 1999, Cornwell published Hitler's Pope, in which he accuses Pope Pius XII of assisting in the legitimisation of the Nazi regime in Germany through the pursuit of a Reichskonkordat in 1933 and of remaining silent, like the Allies, after information about the Holocaust was released to the public in late 1942 and early 1943. Owen Chadwick praised the book's scholarly approach and the abundance of new information Cornwell had managed to unearth. In 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII \\"had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany ... But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions\\".\\"The Papacy\\", The Economist, 9 December 2004, p. 82-83.John Cornwell, The Pontiff in Winter (2004), p. 193.\\"For God's Sake\\", The Economist, December 9, 2004 He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's \\"scope for action was severely limited\\", but that \\"[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did.\\"The Bulletin (Philadelphia), 27 September 2008. In a variety of broadcasts and subsequent print commentary Cornwell has continued to insist that Pacelli's principal failure (as Cardinal Secretary of State), through the Reichsconcordat (1933), was to act as a fellow traveller, taking benefits from Hitler on behalf of Pius XI and the Catholic Church while patently distancing himself from Nazi ideology ‚Äì the effect of which was to scandalise youth, demoralise opposition, and give Hitler credit in the eyes of the world. In 2003, Cornwell followed up Hitler's Pope with Hitler's Scientists. A Pontiff in Winter In 2004, Cornwell also published A Pontiff in Winter, a work critical of Pope John Paul II. Reviews of the book were often fiercely divided. James Carroll in The Washington Post said the book \\"dissects the record of John Paul II's pontificate with an informed, dispassionate and fully convincing authority\\".James Carroll, \\" The Pope and His Legacy\\", The Washington Post, 30 January 2005. Writing in the Guardian, Stephen Bates said: \\"John Cornwell has produced a devastating report. Catholics should read it, if not to change their views ‚Äì though perhaps it should ‚Äì then at least to inform them\\".Stephen Bates, \\"The Vatican's Lear\\", The Guardian, 11 February 2005. Newman's Unquiet Grave: The Reluctant Saint Published in 2010 by Continuum, this biography of Cardinal John Henry Newman coincided with renewed interest in the 19th century theologian and religious leader as a result of his beatification during the Papal visit by Pope Benedict XVI to England and Scotland. Philosopher Anthony Kenny in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that \\"Newman's Unquiet Grave is a substantial achievement ... John Cornwell has taken on the task of writing a biography of Newman to make his life intelligible to the largely secular public which in a few weeks will watch on television the ceremony of his beatification. He has followed a via media between the hagiography of Meriol Trevor and the mockery of Lytton Strachey, and he has produced a Life which is readable, sympathetic and judicious ... Altogether, he has succeeded in building up a vivid picture of Newman's personality.\\"Anthony Kenny, \\"Was Cardinal Newman a Saint?\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 28 July 2010. Science, Ethics and Humanities As Research Fellow (elected 1990, Fellow Commoner 1996) and Director of the Science and Human Dimension Project at Jesus College, Cambridge, Cornwell has brought together many scientists, philosophers, ethicists, authors and journalists to debate and discuss a range of topics. His books in the field of public understanding of science include Nature's Imagination, Consciousness and Human Identity, and Explanations, all published by Oxford University Press. His journalism in this field has been published in a variety of outlets including Financial Times, Sunday Times Magazine, The Observer, New Statesman, New Scientist, Nature, Prospect, Times Literary Supplement, The Tablet, Brain, New Scientist, The Guardian, and The Times. Broadcast contributions to many BBC programmes, especially on culture, science and religion, including Hard Talk, Choice, Start the Week, The Moral Maze (e.g. witness on genetic determinism debate), Today (e.g. debate with Richard Dawkins); Beyond Belief (on John Henry Newman's Idea of a University), Thought for the Day (on Darwin's birthday), Sunday, and various programmes in the BBC's World Service. Rustat Conferences In 2009, he was appointed founding director of the Rustat Conferences, also based at Jesus College, Cambridge. This project brings together academics with those from politics, business, the media and education to discuss the vital issues of the day in a roundtable format.

As of October 2008, the book has been published in 33 countries around the world, in 30 different languages.Shanville Monthly 99(See Section titled SHAN ACROSS THE GLOBE) A film based on the first three books in the series was released in theatres on October 23, 2009. Blackstone Audio has also released CD recordings of all 12 books in the series, read by Ralph Lister. Background Darren O'Shaughnessy wrote and published the first book of the series, Cirque du Freak, under the pen name Darren Shan as a side project between two adult books. Cirque du Freak received good reviews and Warner Bros. bought the movie rights prior to publication, though the film was never made and the film rights returned to Shan after three years.Darren Shan/Facts: Biography Now, Universal Pictures own the film rights and a feature film was released in theatres on October 23, 2009. Plot outline The Saga of Darren Shan follows the story of Darren Shan, a normal human boy who is coerced by the vampire Larten Crepsley into becoming his assistant and a half-vampire. * In the first trilogy, known as Vampire Blood or The Vampire's Assistant, Darren learns about and comes to accept his vampirism. ** In the first book, Cirque du Freak (also known as Cirque du Freak: A Living Nightmare), Mr. Crepsley makes Darren a half-vampire in return for saving the life of one of Darren's best friends, Steve Leonard. ** In the second book, The Vampire's Assistant, Crepsley notes that Darren is quite lonely and brings him back to the freak show, where he befriends a snake-boy, Evra Von, and a human, Sam Grest. ** In the third book, Tunnels of Blood, Crepsley brings Darren Shan and Evra Von to his hometown, where one of the vampires' enemies, a Vampaneze named Murlough, is murdering innocent people. * In the second trilogy, known as Vampire Rites, Darren learns about the vampire clan and seeks their acceptance. ** In the fourth book, Vampire Mountain, Mr. Crepsley and Darren make their ascent up Vampire Mountain and learn about the rites of the vampires. ** In the fifth book, Trials of Death, Darren faces the Trials of Initiation, nicknamed Trials of Death, to gain the recognition of other vampires as one of the youngest vampires to be recruited in decades. ** In the sixth book, The Vampire Prince, Darren finds out about a traitor among them and tries to stop plans to destroy the vampire clan. He himself becomes a Vampire Prince, in this book. * In the third trilogy, known as Vampire War, Darren learns he may have a larger role to play in the fate of the vampires (and of the world) than he had ever thought. ** In the seventh book, Hunters of the Dusk, the hunt for the Lord of the Vampaneze, who is destined to destroy the vampire clan, begins. ** In the eighth book, Allies of the Night, Darren meets some of his past friends who now fit into his quest. ** In the ninth book, Killers of the Dawn, Darren faces the Lord of the Vampaneze for the second time. * In the fourth trilogy, known as Vampire Destiny, Darren is forced to make some difficult decisions, finally taking his destiny into his own hands and dealing with the consequences. ** In the tenth book, The Lake of Souls, Darren travels to an unfamiliar land to find out who his best friend, Harkat Mulds, used to be; as a \\"Little Person\\", Harkat's mind sans memories was placed into a new body after his death. ** In the eleventh book, Lord of the Shadows, Darren finds out more about the Lord of the Shadows and gets closer to his last confrontation with the Lord of the Vampaneze. **In the twelfth book, Sons of Destiny, Darren faces the Lord of the Vampaneze for a final fight, and changes his destiny forever. Main characters=Darren Shan's Vampires= The vampires in The Darren Shan Saga are different from vampires found in popular culture. They are alive, meaning that they can be killed by a well-placed bullet, mutilation, decapitation or piercing of the heart (though they will wake up within a day or less if their neck is broken). Vampires do not have fangs and they do not drink blood from the neck. Rather, they drink blood from the victim by cutting a vein with their hard, and sharp nails; drinking small amounts of blood, and then healing it with their saliva. Their nails can also be used to scale walls in a spider-like manner. Draining all of a human's blood would have a vampire absorb a part of the spirit of the victim, allowing the vampire to see into their memories (Darren does this in The Vampire's Assistant, to save the spirit of his dying friend). Vampires have a partial immunity to Sunlight; which means they can stay in pure daylight for 4-5 hours before disintegrating or burning up. However, despite this, Vampires can be active during the day (provided they stay in the shade). By contrast, Half-Vampires have complete immunity to Sunlight by default. Vampires are not bothered by garlic, silver, or holy objects. Fresh human blood is the most nutritious for vampires, but they can feed on preserved human blood or the blood of certain animals if necessary. Some animals' blood, however, is toxic to vampires. Vampires cannot reproduce, due to all their fluids being frozen. Vampires are created via blood-to-blood contact with humans, traditionally through the fingertips, but if any creature, human or animal, were to orally ingest vampire blood, it would be driven into a murderous frenzy and then die (similar to rabies). Full Vampires age one year in appearance for every ten human years that pass (1/10), where as half- vampires age one year in appearance for every five human years that pass (1/5). This comes into play in the series when Darren meets an old girlfriend he had; now they are adults but Darren still looks about the same as he did when they first met. The oldest vampire in the series is Paris Skyle, who was \\"Blooded\\" at age two and lived for over eight hundred years. Vampires cast reflections and shadows but cannot be photographed due to a particular vibration of their atoms. Also, as in folklore, vampires sleep in coffins. Vampires are considerably stronger, tougher, and fitter than humans; able to outperform humans in any physical activity and run at speeds faster than the human eye can follow, a process called \\"Flitting\\". Flitting causes a static charge to build up in a vampire's body, which Mr. Crepsley learned to use to force open locks. A vampire's senses are all similar to that of predators, allowing them to see in darkness, hear heartbeats, and track scents. Their bones and teeth are stronger than those of humans, allowing them to endure incredible amounts of physical trauma, are resistant to most chemicals and diseases, and are able to heal and recover much quicker than humans. A vampire's healing factor is not as effective as in most fiction, though they are more resistant to fatal injury compared to humans and other living creatures, and, unlike the beautiful vampires of Anne Rice, most of Shan's vampires are very average, normal and plain in appearance. More abilities include breathing an invisible gas that renders a human unconscious, telepathically communicating with other vampires and humans (three vampires could also mentally command spiders), and locating vampires and humans whose thought patterns they have learned to recognize. The blood of snakes, rats, and cats are poisonous to them. Vampire society is ruled by honor, personal pride, and tradition. They have a strict hierarchy with higher ranking vampires having absolute rule over lower ranking ones, though they exercise their powers in moderation and are respectful of those beneath them. There are far fewer female vampires than male ones. Vampire matings last only ten or fifteen years with the couple then choosing to re-mate or go their separate ways. Vampires are forbidden to use projectile weapons like guns, bows, and crossbows as they view these as dishonourable, preferring hand-to-hand fighting with swords, axes, etc., or throwing weapons such as a shuriken. Vampires live old fashioned lives: no vampire aside from Darren Shan is shown making references to pop culture, or using computers. Vampires see humans as a chaotic and slightly inferior race, but most value human lives. Some vampires form friendships with humans and many fall in love with them. Vampire Gavner Purl boasts a pair of pink underpants embroidered with elephants, a present from a former human girlfriend. Darren Shan's vampires do not follow the religions they did as humans, but worship an unidentified pantheon. They believe that the souls of good vampires are reborn as wolves in the eternal nights of a distant world called Paradise, while evil vampire souls remain bound to the Earth for eternity. They do have gods, but there are a great number of them and they are referred to as the Vampire Gods. Vampires believe they are descended from wolves, just as humans have evolved from primates. Wolves are held as the cousins of vampires. Wolves like vampires, especially since they have a scent that means no harm to them. =Vampaneze= In The Series of Darren Shan the Vampaneze are sworn rivals to the vampire believing that there is honour in killing their victims and claiming their souls. They were originally vampires who broke away from the clan (600 years before the third book) and claimed themselves a new race (Vampaneze) because of the different customs they held. A violent war followed, which eventually ended in a truce when human interference threatened the survival of both races, and both groups mutually agreed to stay out of each other's affairs. This extends even to those who have become insane such as Murlough - killing him risked bringing the wrath of the entire race down on Darren and Mr Crepsley's heads, and the vampires would be honour-bound not to intervene. The Vampaneze are considered antagonists, though they only appear that way due to the misleading image of Murlough, the Vampaneze Lord and the War of the Scars. Mr Crepsley himself noted that vampaneze had some positive traditions such as their refusal to lie and their sense of honour. The Vampaneze have purple skin and red hair, eyes, lips, and fingernails though it takes a couple of decades for this colouring to set in. This is a side effect due to drinking a lot of blood: though killing humans when draining their blood was originally a choice based on their beliefs, in the modern day their blood compels Vampaneze to kill when they drink. Many Vampaneze do not want to fight the vampires, and though Gannen Harst has sworn to protect the Lord of Vamapaneze, Steve Leonard, in the final book Harst does not stop Steve from putting himself in danger, as if he merely wants the war between Vampires and Vampaneze settled one way or the other. The Vampaneze are first mentioned in Tunnels of Blood and become a main part of the plot throughout the rest of the series. Examples of Vampaneze include Murlough and Gannen Harst. =Death's Touch sign= The Death's Touch sign is a hand position used in The Saga of Darren Shan series. It is used by vampires throughout Vampire Mountain to show their appreciation towards a dead vampire, or one that is likely to die. The sign involves placing one's middle finger on the right hand in the middle of the forehead, with the ring finger on the left eyelid, the index finger on the right eyelid, and the pinky and thumb outstretched. The sign itself translates to the saying, \\"Even in death, may you be triumphant\\". The sign first appears in the fifth book, Trials of Death, when Darren must take the Trials of Initiation. The vampires in the mountain direct the sign towards him to wish him good luck. Ratings The series The Saga of Darren Shan is rated 4.4/5 by Goodreads and 9/10 by Fantasy Book Review.

Vic is a skeletal figure wearing a suit who embodies the phrase \\"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\\" as well as a symbol of censorship. His eyes are covered by a riveted-on visor, his mouth is clamped shut, and his ears are closed with metal caps. Concept and creation The mythic creation of Vic Rattlehead is addressed in the song \\"The Skull Beneath the Skin\\" from the album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! Dave Mustaine sketched the original drawing of Vic for the album's front cover. However, Combat Records lost the artwork and improvised a completely different concept. The original artwork was recovered and placed on the reissue of Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!. The name of Vic stands for \\"victim\\" and Rattlehead comes from what Mustaine's mother used to say to him when he was headbanging: \\"Don't do that or you'll rattle something up in there!\\" This then led to the expression \\"to rattle one's head\\" meaning head-bang. According to Mustaine, the mascot represents his feelings about religious repression and freedom of expression. Appearances Vic was on the cover art of the band's first four albums (1985‚Äì1990): Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!, Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?, So Far, So Good... So What!, and Rust in Peace. Vic did not appear on the front cover of any albums or compilations from 1991 to 2000. However, when Megadeth tried to bring back a more \\"classic\\" vibe to their material, he returned for the 2001 album The World Needs a Hero, the 2004 album The System Has Failed, as well as the 2007 studio album United Abominations in a human form. He is identified by his visor, metal caps on his ears, and clamps on his mouth. Only Vic's face is shown in the mushroom cloud on the 2005 compilation Greatest Hits: Back to the Start. Vic was once again absent from the cover of Endgame, instead found in the album's booklet much like the inside cover of Youthanasia and Countdown To Extinction. His portrait image can also be found by joining the spine labels of the 7 albums Mustaine re-released in 2004. Vic was mentioned in the band's 2010 video \\"The Right to Go Insane\\" and featured on the cover art for the \\"Sudden Death\\" single. On the cover of Th1rt3en he is shown with his back turned. Vic can be seen very faintly on the Super Collider album artwork as a reflection in the center of the particle collider; it is revealed inside the cover and on the back that Vic is the Super Collider. On Dystopia, a robot version of Vic Rattlehead is seen. In 1993, Megadeth appeared as \\"Vic and the Rattleheads\\" at Rock City club Nottingham. Vic has made small appearances in the music videos for \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", \\"Wake Up Dead\\", \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\", and \\"Hangar 18\\". Vic also appears in the music video for \\"Moto Psycho\\" (At around 3:03) Redesign contest On January 29, 2006, an official contest was announced on DeviantArt to redesign the Megadeth icon. The contest stated: > After two decades of rocking, the heavy metal band Megadeth‚Äôs mascot Vic > Rattlehead needs a facelift and the band has commissioned DeviantArt to > redesign him!! Not only do you get the chance to redesign a mascot whose > image has appeared on several Megadeth albums as well as a myriad of band > merchandise, you can also win the biggest prizes we've ever offered for a > DeviantArt contest! The prizes were three different ESP electric guitars. The contest ended on February 14, 2006, and was judged by Mustaine, with the results posted on DeviantArt on March 15, 2006. United Abominations The cover art for Megadeth's eleventh album, United Abominations, revealed a redesigned Vic, using artwork from John Lorenzi, one of the DeviantArt contest entries, albeit not a winning entry. Vic appeared as an elderly man rather than a skeletal figure. He was, however, depicted with traits of the Four Horsemen mentioned in the album and shown inside the CD case‚Äîhe is accompanied by an angel wearing white with blood-stained wings (aka the \\"Angel of Deth\\", and an allusion to the Pestilence Horseman), has long black hair and a black cloak resembling the black horse of Famine, is wielding various firearms like the sword used by the War Horseman, and has pale, veinous-looking skin like that of Death, and is, of course, shown dealing death on a large scale. A reflection of the classic Vic can also be found on the far-right building on the front cover.

Her career in contemporary music began from her desire to help young composers of her generation get their compositions performed.TIME ‚Äì The Armenian Sisters Additionally, she enjoyed performing the music of established contemporary performers. She included these composers with the traditional repertoire in her performances. Early life and education Ajemian was born in Manhattan on January 26, 1924. She began her music studies early at the Institute of Musical Art, which later merged with the Juilliard School. After graduating from the Lincoln School, Ajemian continued her education at the Juilliard School, studying violin with √âdouard Dethier and chamber music with Hans Letz and Felix Salmon, and played in the Juilliard orchestra under Albert Stoessel and Edgar Shenkman. Musical career In 1946, while still a student of √âdouard Dethier at the Juillard Graduate School of Music, Ajemian won the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation Award. In the same year, she made her debut at Town Hall and received the Distinguished Achievement Medal from Mademoiselle magazine as the Young Woman of the Year in Music. Among the many honors that have followed, the Order of St. James appointed her a Knight of Malta for her lifelong support of contemporary classical music. With her pianist sister Maro Ajemian, she performed in Europe, Canada and throughout the United States in a wide repertoire including works which were written for them by such distinguished composers as John Cage, Henry Cowell, Alan Hovhaness, Ernst Krenek, Lou Harrison, Wallingford Riegger, Carlos Surinach, and Ben Weber. Together and separately, the Ajemian sisters recorded extensively for Columbia, RCA Victor, MGM and Composers Records, Inc. They were the first musicians to receive the Laurel Leaf Award of the Composers Alliance for Distinguished Service to American Music. Ajemian and her sister were equally known for their interpretations of the standard classical repertoire. A unique feature of the many television programs they taped for NBC‚Äôs Recital Hall and the National Educational Television Network was their series of programs comprising the complete cycle of all ten Beethoven Sonatas for Violin and Piano. They appeared as soloists under the batons of Dimitri Mitropoulos, Leopold Stokowski and Izler Solomon, and recorded with the latter two. Also during the 1940s, Ajemian co-founded the New York City-based organization Friends of Armenian Music Committee, which did much to launch the career of fellow Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness, via a series of well-received New York concerts of his music. These concerts were repeated in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Ajemian and her husband, George Avakian, started Music for Moderns, a Town Hall, in 1957. In the mid-sixties, Ajemian and her fellow violinist Matthew Raimondi founded the Composers String Quartet at the suggestion of Gunther Schuller, which quickly earned an international reputation and toured in more than 26 countries, including the Soviet Union, India, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and China. The Composers String Quartet recorded extensively for the Musical Heritage Society, Nonesuch Records, Composers Recordings, Inc. and Columbia Records among many others. The Quartet‚Äôs 1970 recording of Elliott Carter‚Äôs \\"First and Second Quartets\\" was honored by a Grammy nomination, received ‚ÄúStereo Review‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Chamber Music Recording of the Year‚Äù Award, and was acclaimed by High Fidelity as ‚ÄúBest Quartet of the Year‚Äù and one of the ‚ÄúFifty Greatest Albums of the Decade.‚Äù Time magazine called it ‚Äúan astonishingly brilliant and unique achievement.‚Äù Teaching The Quartet was in residence at Columbia University in New York City and the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. For many years, they were the primary performers at the Mt Desert Festival of Chamber Music in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Ajemian was a long-time member of the Columbia University music faculty and served as a judge for several music organizations, including the annual Naumburg Foundation Awards. Personal life She was married to George Avakian, a record producer and founding officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. They had three children: Maro, Anahid and Gregory.

SS-Freiwilligen Gebirgs-Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\")Official designation in German language as to ‚ÄûBundesarchiv-Milit√§rarchiv‚Äú in Freiburg im Breisgau, stores of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. was a German mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS during World War II. It served only in occupied Yugoslavia. The Waffen-SS was the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht. Formed in 1941 from both Germans and Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) volunteers and conscripts from the Banat, Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Hungary and Romania, the division fought a counter-insurgency campaign against communist-led Yugoslav Partisan resistance forces in the German-occupied territories of Serbia and Montenegro, and in the NDH. It was given the title Prinz Eugen after Prince Eugene of Savoy, an outstanding military leader of the Habsburg Empire who liberated the Banat and Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18. It was initially named the SS-Freiwilligen-Division Prinz Eugen (SS-Volunteer Division Prinz Eugen). Background After the invasion, occupation and dismantling of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941, the Wehrmacht placed Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica) and the Banat under a military government. Formation The division was formed in late 1941 following the Invasion of Yugoslavia, initially from German-speaking Danube Swabian Selbstschutz in the Banat, which was an autonomous area within the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. A key figure in the organisation of the division was the Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei (Police General) August Meyszner. \\"After the initial rush of Volksdeutsche to join, voluntary enlistments tapered off, and the new formation did not reach division size. Therefore, in August 1941, the SS discarded the voluntary approach, and after a favorable judgement from the SS court in Belgrade, imposed a mandatory military obligation on all Volksdeutsche in Banat, the first of its kind for non-Reich Germans. One of the reasons for the forced conscription of ethnic Germans was the disappointingly low number of volunteers for the division after the initial recruitments (no more than 5000). While the division remained \\"volunteer\\" in name, few of the conscripted ethnic Germans actively sought entry into the unit. SS Reichsf√ºhrer Himmler had announced that the wishes of the Volksdeutsche were irrelevant, while in connection with the Balkan Germans the SS head of recruitment Gottlob Berger remarked: \\"kein Mensch [k√ºmmert] [sich ja] darum, was wir unten mit unseren Volksdeutschen tun\\" (\\"no person cares what we do with our ethnic Germans in the South\\").Wittmann, A.M., \\"Mutiny in the Balkans: Croat Volksdeutsche, the Waffen-SS and Motherhood\\", East European Quarterly XXXVI No. 3 (2002), p. 258‚Äì260 Ethnic Germans in the Balkans were therefore powerless and could not oppose conscription into the SS. The unwillingness of ethnic Germans to serve in the unit is illustrated by a mutiny of 173 Croatian Germans of the division in 1943 in Bosnia. Apparently the men of mixed ancestry did not speak German and were mistreated by their superiors as a result. Himmler intervened personally in the problem and even ordered any NCO that insulted the mother of the Croatian German troops to be shot on the spot (the insulting of mothers being common in the Balkans).Wittmann, A.M., \\"Mutiny in the Balkans: Croat Volksdeutsche, the Waffen-SS and Motherhood\\", East European Quarterly XXXVI No. 3 (2002), p. 265 Many of these men preferred service in the Croatian Home Guard for a variety of reasons. In 1942, the Panƒçevo-based unit was declared a Mountain Division. They were issued with a significant amount of non-standard German weapons and used captured equipment such as Czech machine guns like the ZB-53 and French light tanks. They were provided with excellent German-made mountain artillery such as the 10.5 cm Gebirgshaubitze 40 howitzer and 7.5 cm Gebirgsgesch√ºtz 36 mountain gun. When the division was formed, it was assigned to the Balkans as an anti-Partisan mountain division. =1942= In October 1942, the division led a German-Bulgarian anti-guerrilla offensive by the name of Operation Kopaonik against the Chetniks in the Kopaonik, Goƒç and Jastrebac mountains of the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The operation was aimed at the destruction of the Rasina Corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, commanded by Major Dragutin Keseroviƒá, whose headquarters was located in the village of Kriva Reka. Germans and Bulgarians cleared the Chetnik free territory and in the process committed war crimes against the Serbian civilian population. The Chetniks successfully withdrew from the German-Bulgarian ring to territory that was beyond the reach of the occupation forces. Keseroviƒá and his troops had been participating in military operations against the Bulgarians and Germans for the previous year. The Chetniks were a threat to the Germans because they were able to break the German road communications and interfere with the movement of war materiel intended for Rommel's forces on the African front‚Äîthrough the Morava‚àíVardar valley. Losses were inflicted on Keseroviƒáev's detachments and the local population by the constantly pursuing enemy forces. The Germans, worried about a potential attack on the Trepƒça mine near Kosovska Mitrovica, from which they pulled significant amounts of lead and zinc, decided in the spring of 1942 to launch an attack involving some 20,000 soldiers. In early October 1942 the division was deployed in southwestern Serbia, in Kraljevo, U≈æice, Ivanjica, ƒåaƒçak, Ra≈°ka, Kosovska Mitrovica, and Novi Pazar. Elements of the 9th Bulgarian Infantry Division were also assigned to the attack. The Rasina Corps at that time had about 1,500 fighters under arms. On 5 October 1942 Phleps ordered the German and Bulgarian forces to destroy the Chetnik forces. A comprehensive attack was planned: 20,000 well-armed and fully trained German troops would encircle the Serbians from four directions using a precisely defined plan of fire. Because of the perceived importance of this operation and to observe the first military operations of the newly established SS Division, Reichsf√ºhrer- SS Heinrich Himmler travelled to Kraljevo in the German occupation zone. Himmler was in Kraljevo from 15 to 18 October 1942 and toured the division. German and Bulgarian forces began their attack on the Chetnik territory at dawn on 12 October 1942. As planned, the attack proceeded from four directions. German combat group \\"North\\" marched to the top of ≈Ωeljin, and a secondary group to the top of Kavalj. Combat group \\"South\\" conducted a comprehensive movement in the area around Gobelja, located 17 km northwest of Ra≈°ka. Combat group \\"West\\" concentrated its forces in the valley 5 km from Banje. Combat group \\"East\\" took a position west of Brus. Germans and Bulgarians made a ring around the Chetnik territory and forced the peasants into hiding. German combat groups \\"North\\", \\"West\\", and \\"South\\" proceeded along a front through the Chetnik territory in the direction of combat group \\"East\\", which was assigned the role of forming a wall to stop the Chetniks. However, Keseroviƒá had intelligence about the preparations and the movement of large German forces for an attack, and did not consider it useful to meet the German and Bulgarian forces on a wide front. He ordered his units to regroup into smaller squads for easy maneuvering and penetration. His tactic meant the Chetnik Rasina Corps was able to escape from the ring of enemy soldiers. The Germans and Bulgarians committed reprisals against the civilian population and burned several villages. The village of Kriva Reka, the location of Keseroviƒá's headquarters, suffered the most: 120 civilians were locked in the village church and burned to death by members of the 7th SS Division. In other villages in Kopaonik 300 civilians were killed; in the villages on Mount Goƒç 250 civilians were executed. The Germans killed a total of 670 civilians during this operation. The division's next action was in the Serbian- Montenegro border in the mountains east of the Ibar River and afterwards it took part in the Fourth anti-Partisan Offensive in the Zagreb-Karlovac area, where together with Italian forces attempted to defeat the Partisans commanded by Josip Broz Tito, the operation failed and most of the Partisans managed to evade the main attack. =1943= In Operation Weiss I, the Division advanced from Karlovac area against NOVJ units resistance and on January 29 captured informal partisan capital Bihaƒá. In Operation Weiss II it forced its way from western Bosnia to Mostar area in Hercegovina and also deployed units northwest of Sarajevo. In May the Division took part in operation against Chetniks. The Operation was successful and Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá was forced to retreat to Serbia with his headquarters. From 15 May ‚Äì 15 June, the division took a part in the Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive (Operation Schwartz) aiming to pin Tito's main force of about 20,000 Partisans against the Zelengora mountain, in southeastern Bosnia.Lampe, John, Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country, 2nd ed.

In 11-day fightings from May 20 division captured ≈†avnik. For this success major (Sturmbannf√ºhrer) Dietsche as well as commander Phleps received first two Knight's Crosses for the division.Otto Kumm: VORW√ÑRTS, PRINZ EUGEN! ‚Äì Geschichte der 7. SS-Freiwilligen-Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\", Munin-Verlag, Coburg 1978, page 243 In the following days the focal point of the battle shifted westward. After the main group of the Partisans headed by 1st Proletarian Division broke out of the encirclement, two battalions of the division that were moved to cover the left bank of the Sutjeska river and block the Partisan's escape route were surprised by the attack of three battalions of 1st Dalmatian and one from 5th Montenegro Brigade at Tjenti≈°te pushing them back. They recovered their positions during a night battle and decimated most Partisan units.Mirko Novoviƒá, Stevan Petkoviƒá: PRVA DALMATINSKA PROLETERSKA BRIGADA, Vojnoizdavaƒçki zavod, Beograd 1986, pages 176‚Äì211 (serbo- croatian) In the operation Schwartz the division suffered total losses of 613 men.NARA records, T-314, roll 560, frame 750‚Äì751 In August 1943, the division became a part of the XV Mountain Corps and was sent to the Dalmatian coast, to disarm the Italian forces in September 1943 after the Italian Government had surrendered to the Allies. In exploiting Italian capitulation, NOVJ succeeded in seizing control of the most part of the Dalmatian coast. In sixteen-days long battle the division, together with 92nd Motorized Regiment, pushed back NOVJ units and on September 29 reoccupied Split. In October, division participated in Operation Landsturm, another anti-Partisan operation in Omi≈°, Ploƒçe and Biokovo. In battles for Split and Biokovo coastline, division suffered losses of 1582 killed, wounded and missing in action. The division was reorganized on 22 October 1943 and was renamed the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. In November, the unit was attached to the V SS Mountain Corps and took part in anti-Partisan Operations Kugelblitz and Schneesturm in December 1943.German Order of Battle, Volume 3 By Samuel W.

In May division took part in Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive (Operation R√∂sselsprung) which began on 25 May 1944. This operation had the task of killing or capturing Tito, and the operation was spearheaded by the 500th SS Fallschirmj√§ger-Bataillon and supported by the Brandenburg Regiment. In this timespan many other ethnic groups joined the division, such as ethnic Croats, Hungarians, and over 1000 ethnic Serbs who volunteered for the division at General Phelps' office, most of whom were either ideologically or otherwise motivated to fight against the Partisans.Otto Kumm: VORW√ÑRTS, PRINZ EUGEN! ‚Äì Geschichte der 7. SS-Freiwilligen-Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\", Munin-Verlag, Coburg 1978, page 79 In May, June and July, the division also saw action in operations Freie Jagd, Rose and Feuerwehr. In August (12‚Äì30 August) the division was engaged in operation R√ºbezahl, aimed to prevent offensive of NOVJ forces from Montenegro into western Serbia. In September, the Soviet Red Army had advanced to the Balkans and the division suffered heavy casualties in defensive battles against Bulgarian, Soviet and NOVJ forces in the Nish region. On 21 September, Obergruppenf√ºhrer Artur Phleps‚Äîthe division's first commander‚Äîwas believed to have been killed when en route from Montenegro to Transylvania. The division's next action was the defence of the Kraljevo Bridgehead (Br√ºckenkopf Kraljevo) as the part of Army Corps M√ºller. This defence was essential for the success of Army Group E efforts to open a corridor which would allow the retreat of 350,000 German soldiers from Greece and the Aegean. In the beginning of November, the SS 1st Albanian Skanderbeg Division was disbanded and its remnants incorporated into the 14th Regiment of Prinz Eugen, which received its honor title Skanderbeg. =1945= In January 1945, the division was again in action against the Yugoslav army at Otok and Vukovar. In February it took part in Operation Wehrwolf against Yugoslav bridgehead in the Virovitica area. The retreat from Bosnia continued and Prinz Eugen retreated through the NDH in April 1945. On 10 May, the division retreated towards Celje in Slovenia where it surrendered to Yugoslav forces on 11 May. War crimes Researchers of the Institute of History in Karlovac established a number of 276 civilian inhabitants of Karlovac area, killed by 7. SS Division during Operation Weiss I in January 1943. In February, the division conducted, together with 369th and 717th division, an assault on Grmeƒç. Some 15,000 civilian inhabitants, frightened and unwilling to wait for Germans, broke through the German lines together with Partisans, but those left behind were destroyed mercilessly. Another drama of an attack on a refugee column happened on late February near Resanovci, during the Operation Weiss II, and resulted with hundreds of victims. According to official postwar investigation, the three German divisions were responsible for 3,370 killed civilians, and another 1,722 deported to concentration camps during the Operation Weiss. The division was infamous for its cruelty, and committed numerous atrocities in the area of Nik≈°iƒá in Montenegro: On 6 August, 1946, during the morning session at the N√ºrnberg trials, it was said that \\"The 7th SS Division, Prinz Eugen, is famed for its cruelty\\" and that \\"Wherever it passed-through Serbia, through Bosnia and Herzegovina, through Lika and Banija or through Dalmatia -everywhere it left behind scenes of conflagration and devastation and the bodies of innocent men, women, and children who had been burned in the houses.\\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/08-06-46.asp In late May and early June 1943, during Operation Schwartz, the division killed large number of civilians and prisoners of war. In the villages of Dub, Bukovac, Miljkovac, Duba and Rudinci, in the Piva area, all captured inhabitants were killed, regardless of age or sex. The total number of victims from these villages was around 400. On 12 July in the Muslim village Rotimlja, near Stolac, the 7th SS Division killed 66 civilians, 25 of which were younger than 15. On the same day, other units of the division killed 68 civilians, 36 younger than 15, in Muslim village of Ko≈°utica, near Sokolac. During its advancement towards Split, on 17‚Äì30 September 1943, the division killed 230 inhabitants of the villages in the Imotski, Sinj and Split area. After capturing Split, the division executed 48 Italian officers and three generals (General Raffaele Peligra, commander of the artillery of the XVIII Corps, General Poticardi, commander of the pioneers of the XVIII Corps, and General Alfonso Cigala Fulgosi, Commander of the 17th Littoral Brigade). On 5 November, the division executed 25 hostages in Sinj in a retribution for losses. The 2nd Battalion of the 14th SS Regiment of the division killed 1,525 civilians on 26‚Äì30 March 1944, in the villages between Kame≈°nica and Mosor near Split, in an action under command of V SS Corps. Out of the four commanders of the division, one (Phleps) was killed in battle, two of them were sentenced to death by hanging and executed in Belgrade 1947, and the fourth (Kumm) managed to avoid extradition to Yugoslavia by fleeing over the wall of the internment camp of Dachau.

He served as commander of the Kriegsmarine's destroyer forces and commanded the battleship Scharnhorst in the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943, during which the German ship was sunk. Bey was killed during that action. Career Bey joined the Kaiserliche Marine on 13 June 1916 and served in its destroyer arm. Following the end of World War I, he stayed in the navy and continued his career with the rise of the Nazi Party in power in Germany. By the start of World War II was a Fregattenkapit√§n (frigate captain). Bey led the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of the destroyers Z11 Bernd von Arnim, Z12 Erich Giese and Z13 Erich Koellner, as part of Kommodore Friedrich Bonte's force that carried General Eduard Dietl's mountain troops for the occupation of Narvik during the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940. In the following Battles of Narvik on 10 April and 13 April, Bey distinguished himself by leading a small group of destroyers in a brave though doomed action against a superior Royal Navy force that included the battleship . Bey was awarded with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 9 May 1940. The next day he was promoted to Captain and appointed commander of the German destroyer force (F√ºhrer der Zerst√∂rer), succeeding Commodore Bonte, who had been killed on 10 April in the first Battle of Narvik. Bey then commanded the destroyer screen protecting the ships of the Brest Group (Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Prinz Eugen) during Operation Cerberus (the ‚ÄúChannel Dash‚Äù) in February 1942. Of the three, Scharnhorst suffered extensive damage, having struck a naval mine laid off the Dover Straits. Battle of North Cape Promoted to Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral), on Christmas Day, 25 December 1943, Bey led a task force consisting of the battleship Scharnhorst and the destroyers Z29, Z30, Z33, Z34 and Z38 out of Alta Fjord in Operation Ostfront. The first and only surface sortie ordered by Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, Bey's objective was to intercept the Allied Convoy JW 55B en route to Murmansk. Bey's initial force of Scharnhorst and five destroyers was superior to the convoy's escorting British cruisers and destroyers in terms of firepower. However, Bey's flagship was outmatched by Admiral Bruce Fraser's battleship which led another Royal Navy fleet shadowing the convoy. Scharnhorst was expected to use her speed to avoid an engagement with Duke of York. Poor weather, heavy seas and inadequate Luftwaffe reconnaissance, prevented Bey from initially locating the convoy so he detached his destroyers to fan out and assist in the search. However, the storm meant that Bey's destroyers ending up playing no part in the battle. Bey guessed correctly and Scharnhorst then managed to locate the convoy by herself. In the first engagement of the ensuing Battle of North Cape, while trading fire with the British convoy's screening cruisers, Scharnhorsts radar was destroyed, rendering her blind. Scharnhorst was then caught by the more powerful HMS Duke of York and suffered critical damage before being sunk after several torpedo hits from British cruisers. Of Scharnhorsts crew of 1,968, Royal Navy vessels fished 36 men alive from the icy sea, not one of them an officer.

Rockies in northeastern British Columbia, Canada, and a member municipality of the Peace River Regional District. It has a area of , with a population of 1,987 (2016). The municipality incorporates a townsite and a large area of mostly Crown Land.BC Stats, Community Facts, 2006. The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional infrastructure connecting the new town to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1981 by the provincial government to service the coal industry as part of the British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation's Northeast Coal Development. In 1981, a consortium of Japanese steel mills agreed to purchase 100 million tonnes of coal over 15 years for US$7.5 billion from two mining companies, Denison Mines Inc. and the Teck Corporation, who were to operate the Quintette mine and the Bullmoose mine respectively. Declining global coal prices after 1981, and weakening Asian markets in the late 1990s, made the town's future uncertain and kept it from achieving its projected population of 10,000 people. The uncertainty dissuaded investment and kept the economy from diversifying. When price reductions were forced onto the mines, the Quintette mine was closed in 2000 production and the town lost about half its population. Coal prices began to rise after the turn of the century, leading to the opening of the Peace River Coal Trend mine by Northern Energy & Mining Inc. (now owned by Anglo American Met Coal) and the Wolverine Mine, originally owned by Western Canadian Coal, which was purchased by Walter Energy in 2010. After dinosaur footprints, fossils, and bones were discovered in the municipality, along with fossils of Triassic fishes and cretaceous plants, the Peace Region Paleontology Research Center opened in 2003. The research centre and a dinosaur museum were funded in part by the federal Western Economic Diversification Canada to decrease economic dependence on the coal industry. In 2018, the museum to change its operations from science-based to tourism- attraction. Lack of Funds Closes B.C.

This means the mines are effectively closed, but are still allowed to restart without needing to go through the process of getting a new mines act permit. Economic diversification has also occurred with oil and gas exploration, forestry, and recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include numerous trails, mountains, waterfalls, snowmobiling areas and provincial parks, such as Monkman Provincial Park, Bearhole Lake Provincial Park, and Gwillim Lake Provincial Park. History Archaeological evidence show a human presence dating back 3,000 years.Helm (2001), 67 The nomadic Sekani, followed by the Dunneza and then the Cree, periodically lived in temporary settlements around the future municipality.Helm (2001), 68‚Äì69 Formal exploratory and surveying expeditions were conducted by S. Prescott Fay, with Robert Cross and Fred Brewster in 1914, J.C. Gwillim in 1919, Edmund Spieker in 1920, and John Holzworth in 1923. Spieker coined the name Tumbler Ridge, referring to the mountains northwest of the future town, by altering Gwillim's map that named them Tumbler Range.Helm (2000), 45. Permanent settlers were squatters, five families by 1920, who maintained trap lines. In the 1950s and 1960s, oil and natural gas exploration and logging was conducted through the area, and 15 significant coal deposits were discovered.Helm (2000), 49, 76. Coal prices rose after the 1973 oil crisis leading to 40 government studies examining the viability of accessing the coal, given the 1,130 km (700 mi) to the nearest port and the mountainous barrier.Helm (2000), 76. With these coal deposits in mind, a purchasing agreement was signed in 1981 by two Canadian mining companies, a consortium of Japanese steel mills, and the governments of British Columbia and Canada. As part of the deal, the provincial government committed, under the North East Coal Development plan, to build a new town near the deposits, two highways off Highway 97, a power line from the W. A. C. Bennett Dam at Hudson's Hope, and a branch rail line through the Rocky Mountains. An alternative of using work camps staffed by people from Dawson Creek and Chetwynd was also considered. Massive initial investments were required as planning for the new town began in 1976 with the objective of having a fully functioning town ready before residents arrived.Halseth (2002), 38‚Äì39. Coordinated through the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs the town, regional infrastructure, and mining plants were all built simultaneously. When the municipality was incorporated in April 1981 the area was completely forested.\\"Tumbler Ridge looks ready for the builders\\", Alaska Highway News, December 30, 1981. During that year building sites and roadways were cleared and in the winter the water and sewerage system was built. In 1982, houses and other buildings were constructed. Full production at the mines was reached the following year. In early 1983, the families of the managers at the Bullmoose Minesite, led by Dean Sawas appealed to the British Columbia government and were able to create a new settlement, called Bullmoose Settlement. This was done because Dean's wife was expecting and he wanted his child to have something different to say about her birthplace. He wanted her to be able to say that a settlement had been created for her and that she was, and would always be the only one born at that place. At her birth, Alicia V. Sawas was also written into the Tumbler Ridge records as the first child born in the Quintette area. Bullmoose Settlement was closed down after the reduction in mine activities with just the one birth. In 1984, world coal prices were dropping and the Japanese consortium requested a reduction in the price of coal from the Tumbler Ridge mines. As price reduction requests continued, the concern over the viability of the mines led the BC Assessment Authority to lower the 1987 property assessments for the Quintette mine from CAD$156 million to $89 million and the Bullmoose mine $70 million to $43 million.Halseth (2002). This lowered their taxes as they tried to enforce the purchasing agreement at the Supreme Court of Canada. Their 1990 ruling required the Quintette Operations Company to reduce coal prices and reimburse the Japanese consortium $4.6 million. The company responded by reducing production, cutting employment, and applying for court protection from creditors. This allowed Teck to acquire 50% interest and take over management of the Quintette mine, but it was unable to stop further job losses.\\"More layoffs in northeast B.C.\\", CBC News, June 24, 1999. As most residents left town, apartment blocks were closed and the mine companies bought back all but 11 houses in the town. After 30% of the workforce had been laid off, new contracts with the Japanese consortium were signed in 1997, allowing re- hirings to begin, but with lower export levels. The North East Coal Development was projected to create a net benefit of CAD$0.9 billion (2000), but incurred a net loss of $2.8 billion and half the expected regional employment.Gunton, 505. The population declined as many residents were unable to find other work in the town, even as a sawmill for specialty woods opened in 1999. After Teck closed the Quintette mine in August 2000 and shifted production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine, the town council established the Tumbler Ridge Revitalization Task Force to investigate ways to boost and diversify the economy. The Task Force negotiated the return of the housing stock from the mines to the free market, grants from the province to become debt-free,\\"Tumbler Ridge gets $6-million bail out\\", CBC News, October 27, 2000. and stabilized funds from the province for healthcare and education.Halseth (2002), 182, 192. The discovery of dinosaur tracks in 2000 by two local boys while playing near a creek, led to major fossil and bone discoveries from the Cretaceous Period. To survey and study the finds, government funding was secured to found both the Tumbler Ridge Museum Foundation and Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre. After the Bullmoose mine exhausted its supply of coal in 2003, world coal prices increased, making exploration and mining in Tumbler Ridge economically feasible again. Western Canadian Coal opened new open-pit mining operations creating the Dillon mine using Bullmoose mining infrastructure, the Brule mine near Chetwynd using new infrastructure (projected 11-year life span),Ministry of Environment, July 6, 2006.Environmental Assessment Office, June 9, 2006. and the Wolverine mine.Western Canadian Coal, October 2003. These mines were purchased by Walter Energy in 2010, but world coal prices began to drop again in 2011, and in April 2014, Walter put their Canadian operations into \\"care and maintenance mode\\", laying off nearly 700 people. The Peace River Coal Trend Mine was issued its mines act permit in 2005, and was a partnership between NEMI Northern Energy and Mining Inc., Anglo American, Hillsborough Resources and Vitol Anker International. In 2011, Anglo American bought out the rest of the partners to become sole owner of the property. Anglo American started working on the Roman Pit next to their existing Trend operation in 2014, hoping to reduce the cost of production per tonne of coal. However, in late 2014, they announced the mine would be going into care and maintenance mode as well. As of Fall, 2015, there are no coal mines operating in Tumbler Ridge. However, HD Mining is continuing work on the Murray River Coal Mine, a proposed Underground Longwall Mine near Tumbler Ridge. The company was issued its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the BC Government in October 2015, though construction on the mine, if it were to go ahead, is not expected to begin until after a Mines Act Permit is issued, which is not expected until late 2016. On September 22, 2014, the area around Tumbler Ridge was designated North America's second Geopark. Demographics Tumbler Ridge's population trend, 1984‚Äì2006, BC Stats1984 & 1985 figures from Halseth (2002), 86.BC Stats, Municipal Census Populations, 1986‚Äì1996.BC Stats, Municipal Census Populations, 1996‚Äì2006. Population projections in 1977 were for 3,568 residents in 1981, 7,940 in 1985, and 10,584 in 1987, after which the level was expected to stabilize.Thompson et al. (1978), 25. However, requests for lower coal prices shortly after the production began placed a persistent insecurity over the viability of the mines, and therefore the town, discouraging long-term investments. Temporary work camps, where workers numbered between 200 and 2,000, were used during the construction of the town and mines. The planners of the town advised the mining companies to hire workers who were married, believing they would live in Tumbler Ridge longer and reduce employment turn-over.Thompson et al. (1978), 32 The population rose slowly to 3,833 people in 1984, nearly half the projected level.Halseth (2002), 86. The 1986 Canadian census, the first census to include Tumbler Ridge, recorded 4,566 residents after which in-migration ended and the population level began to fluctuate. The population peaked in 1991 at 4,794 people but then declined to a low of 1,932 people in 2001. Since then, population growth has been led by new mining activities and increased exploration following higher world energy prices. The town's population is currently in a state of flux as people dependent on the mines for work leave, while other people, attracted by the town's low rent, arrive. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"0\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 250px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;background-color:#EDD5A3\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Canada 2006 CensusStatistics Canada, 2001 Community Profiles. - style=\\"text- align:center;background-color:#ffebad;\\"   Tumbler RidgeBritish Columbia - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Median age42.2 years40.8 years - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Under 15 years old18%17% - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Over 65 years old11%15% - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Protestant (2001)43%31% - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Catholic (2001)29%17% } The Canada 2006 Census reported 2,454 residents living in 1,045 households and 765 families.Statistics Canada, 2006 Community Profiles. This was 27% more people than the previous census five years earlier when the town was at its lowest population level since opening. The median age increased from 38.8 years in 2001 to 42.2 in 2006, as the proportion of the population aged over 65 rose from 5% to 11%. In 2006, of those over 15 years of age, 62% were married, higher than the 54% provincial average. The town has few visible minorities as 94% of Tumbler Ridge residents were Canadian-born and 93% had English as their first language. Though not included as a minority, 9% of residents claimed to have an Aboriginal identity. Reflecting the nature of the industrial jobs available in town, in 2001, only 12% of residents between 20 and 64 years of age completed university, half of the provincial average, and 26% did not complete high school, much higher than the 19% provincial average. Crime rate in Tumbler Ridge, 1984‚Äì2005Police Services Division, pp. 101, 106‚Äì110, 151, 154. In 2005, the five officer Tumbler Ridge Royal Canadian Mounted Police municipal detachment reported 346 Criminal Code offences. This translated into a crime rate of 137 Criminal Code offences per 1,000 people, higher than the provincial average of 119 offences. During that year, the RCMP reported lower crime rates in Tumbler Ridge, compared with the provincial averages, in all categories except bicycle thefts, property damage, impaired driving, and cannabis-related offences. Until 2005, the town had a lower crime rate than the province, except between 2001 and 2003 after the Quintette mine closure and a large out-migration from the town. In 2004 the Tumbler Ridge RCMP reported no robbery or shoplifting offences, and only 4.5 theft-from-motor-vehicle offences per 1,000 people compared with 20 provincially. Geography and climate The townsite is located on a series of southern-facing gravel terraces on a ridge of Mount Bergeron, overlooking the confluence of the Murray and Wolverine Rivers.Thompson et al. (1978), 85. The site, above the floodplain of the Murray River, has well-drained soils with easy access to aquifers with potable water.PLEDA, 76. The rocks, mostly shale and mudstone but lacking quartzite, make the mountains less rugged than their neighbouring ranges.Helm (2000), 6. The terraces grow Lodgepole Pine, White Spruce, Trembling Aspen trees. Moose and elk are common.Thompson et al. (1978), 86‚Äì87.Helm (2001), 349. Escarpments to the east and north could pose a snow avalanche threat but are kept forested for stability.Thompson et al. (1978), 86. In 2006, the town was evacuated for several days as four forest fires approached the town.\\"More layoffs in northeast B.C.\\" CBC News, July 4, 2006. Major coal deposits indicate the site was a swampy forest during the Cretaceous.Helm (2000), 5. Paleontologists have discovered tracks or fossils from ankylosauria, ornithopods (including a Hadrosaurus), and theropods.Helm (2001), 57‚Äì61. Fossils of Cretaceous plants such as ferns, redwoods, cycads, and ginkgo, and Triassic fishes and reptiles such as coelacanths, Weigeltisaurus, and ichthyosaurs have been recovered.Helm (2001), 53‚Äì55, 61‚Äì63. The town experiences a continental climate. Arctic air masses move predominantly southwestly from the Mackenzie Valley towards the Rocky Mountains and through the mountains north of town.Thompson et al. (1978) 88‚Äì89. The town is in a rain shadow behind Mount Bergeron, though much of the precipitation is lost in the mountains beforehand. Town planners laid out the roads so that they run along wind breaks, and buildings and parks are located in wind shadows.Thompson et al. (1978), 95. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"0\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 250px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;background-color:#B8BFFE\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  WeatherFern Duperreault, Environment Canada, as cited in Helm (2001), 9.Tumbler Ridge (2004), 6. - style=\\"text-align:center;background-color:lavender\\" TimeAverage temperatureAverage precipitation - style=\\"text- align:center;background-color:white\\" January‚àí11.1 ¬∞C (12.0 ¬∞F)40.2 mm (1.6 in) - style=\\"text-align:center;background-color:white\\" July14.8 ¬∞C (58.6 ¬∞F)78.6 mm (3.1 in) - style=\\"text-align:center;background- color:lavender\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" Average annual precipitation : 519 mm (20.4 in) } After examining other resource towns in Canada, the planners followed socio-spatial guidelines and principles in physical planning.Thompson et al. (1978), 97. The coal mining facilities were well separated from the townsite to minimize the feeling of a company town. An attempt to mitigate potential lifestyle conflicts between families and childless households was made by separating the low-density, single-family dwellings from the low-rise apartments.Thompson et al. (1978), 99. The apartment blocks were planned for areas with clusters of trees and excellent viewscapes, but close to the town plaza.Thompson et al. (1978), 97, 99. The low-density residences that were more likely to have children living in them were oriented around elementary schools and parks. Cul-de-sacs were avoided in favour of better linkages and pedestrian access. Infrastructure The municipal border (red) encompasses over 1500 km2 (600 sq mi) of land. The townsite is on the northern end of the municipality where the rivers converge. Two highways diverge from Highway 97 and intersect in Tumbler Ridge: Highway 52 (Heritage Highway) which runs 98 km (61 mi) south at Arras, and Highway 29 which runs 90 km (56 mi) southeast from Chetwynd. At the intersection Highway 29 ends but Highway 52 continues south through Tumbler Ridge, then unpaved, it runs northeast to Highway 2 near the Alberta border. In town, the 28 km (17 mi) of paved roadsReed Construction, 23. are laid out in a curvilinear pattern that use two arterial roads, MacKenzie Way and Monkman Way, to connect each section of town. Service roads from the townsite to the mines and forestry areas are maintained by the industries but are unpaved. The unmanned Tumbler Ridge Airport, with its 1,219 m (4,000 ft) asphalt runway, is used by chartered and local flights. The closest airports with regularly scheduled flights are in Dawson Creek, Fort St John and Grande Prairie.Tumbler Ridge (2006), Flying to Tumbler Ridge. The rail line into town is a 132 km (82 mi) formerly electrified branch line through the Rocky Mountains constructed by BC Rail to transport coal to the Ridley Terminal at the Port of Prince Rupert. The branch line includes two major tunnels: the 9 km (6 mi) Table Tunnel and the 6 km (4 mi) Wolverine Tunnel. The town funds its own 14-member composite fire department with a paid Fire Chief and Protective Services Specialist, water treatment system, and sewage disposal system. Drinking water is drawn from two drilled wells south of the townsite where it is stored in a 7 million litre reservoir before being chlorinated and pumped into town. The storm sewers empty into the Murray River, but the sanitary sewage is processed through a lagoon system and released into the Murray River north of town. Both the town and the province, through the Northern Health Authority, operate the Tumbler Ridge Community Health Centre. The closest hospitals with over-night beds are in Chetwynd and Dawson Creek. The two public schools, Tumbler Ridge Elementary School and Tumbler Ridge Secondary School are run by the School District 59 Peace River South. Post-secondary courses, programs, and industry training are offered by Northern Lights College at the secondary school and community centre. Economy Quintette Coal Mine, Tumbler Ridge Tumbler Ridge was built to provide a labour force for the coal mining industry, which has remained the dominant employer throughout the town's history. The mining companies had a contract to sell 100 million tons of coal to a consortium of Japanese steel mills over 15 years for US$7.5 billion (1981). The Quintette Operating Corporation (QOC) was formed by partnership between Denison Mines (50%), Mitsui Mining (20%), Tokyo Boeki (20%), and other smaller firms, and began blasting at the Quintette mine in October 1982. The Bullmoose Operating Corporation was formed by the Teck Corporation (51%), Lornex (39%), Nissho Iwai (10%) and worked the smaller Bullmoose mine. The economic viability of the mining companies were in question since the world coal prices began falling in the early 1980s and the Japanese consortium requested reduced prices. After the Supreme Court ruled that the coal prices must be reduced, the QOC filed for court protection from its creditors allowing the Teck Corporation to take over management in 1992. By 1996, even as lay-offs continued, over half the town's labour force were employed at one of the two mines.Halseth (2002), 111. New contracts with the Japanese consortium, signed 1997, moved production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine but guaranteed production until 2003 when that mine was expected to be exhausted. The Quintette mine was closed altogether on August 31, 2000. While there was an intent by the town's planners to move to a more diversified economy, the few initiatives in this direction were not supported by the industries or local decision-makers.Halseth (2003), 145. Uncertainty about the town's future had been a serious concern to residents since the 1984 price reduction demands, but it was not until the closure of the Quintette mine that the town seriously investigate a diversification. Since then employment has been generated in tourism (attractions from dinosaur fossil discoveries, outdoor recreation, and nearby provincial parks), forestry, and oil and gas exploration. A $1.4 billion Murray River coal mine project near Tumbler Ridge, operated by HD Mining International, a company majority-owned by Huiyong Holdings Group, a private company from China uses long-wall mining in which \\"coal is extracted along a wall in large blocks and then carried out on a conveyor belt.\\" Penggui Yan, CEO of HD Mining and its controlling shareholder, was a manager of the state-owned China Shenhua Energy Co (CSEC), China's largest coal company, which had developed a highly advanced long-wall mining technology. In 2013 HD mining brought in 52 workers from China through the federal Temporary Foreign Worker Program(TFWP) claiming a requirement of the job is an ability to speak Mandarin. Diana Mehta (July 5, 2013) \\"Temporary Foreign Worker Program May Be Distorting Labour Market Needs: Study\\", Huffington Post The hiring was challenged in a Vancouver federal court by two labour unions in April 2013,\\"B.C. Mine's Temporary Foreign Workers Case In Federal Court\\", April 9, 2013, Huffington Post The unions claimed there were qualified Canadian job applicants, however the case was dismissed by Justice Russell Zinn who found there was nothing to support the unions claim.Jeremy Nuttall (May 21, 2013) \\"Judge dismisses HD Mining court challenge by unions\\", canoe.ca Culture, recreation and media After dinosaur trackways were discovered in 2000, and bones in 2002, the Tumbler Ridge Museum Foundation began excavations and opened the Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre.McCrea (2003). Fossils and bones are displayed at both locations. Tours and educational programs related to dinosaur, the trackways, and the wilderness are offered.Tumbler Ridge Museum (2008). Kinuseo Falls in the Monkman Provincial Park Tumbler Ridge's location among the Rocky Mountains has allowed for the development of numerous trail systems for motorized and non-motorized recreation. The trails and open areas span numerous mountains. Kinuseo Falls along the Murray River in the Monkman Provincial Park is the most popular destination for visitors to Tumbler Ridge.Helm (2001), 261. Two other provincial parks are just outside the municipal boundaries: Bearhole Lake Provincial Park and Gwillim Lake Provincial Park. Annual events held in Tumbler Ridge include the Grizfest Music Festival, Emperor's Challenge ‚Äì promoted as the most beautiful and most challenging half-marathon in the world ‚Äì and the Ridge Ramble Cross-Country Ski Race. The Grizfest Music Festival (formerly Grizzly Valley Days) is a two-day concert held on the August long weekend, and includes a parade, dance, art show, and other community-wide events.Grizfest, 2007. The Emperor's Challenge, also in August, is a 21 km (13 mi) marathon up Roman Mountain.Emperor's Challenge, 2007. Tumbler Ridge has one newspaper published in the community, the locally owned and operated Tumbler Ridge News (formerly Community Connections). The Tumbler Ridge Observer formerly covered the town and was published by the Peace River Block Daily News in Dawson Creek. The Ridge Blog was a short-lived online news source. One newsletter, Coffee Talk, based out of Chetwynd, is circulated in the town. No radio station, or television station broadcasts from the town but there are local repeaters for stations from larger centres. In Fall 2014 Tumbler Ridge was designated a full member of UNESCO's Global Geopark Network. Comprising 7,822 km2, the geopark highlights the geological heritage of the area such as Cretaceous dinosaur tracks and bone bed and fossils of Triassic fishes and marine reptiles. Government and politics Tumbler Ridge district hall The District of Tumbler Ridge's council-manager form of municipal government is headed by a mayor (who also represents Tumbler Ridge on the Peace River Regional District's governing board) and a six-member council; these positions are subject to at-large elections every three years. Don McPherson was elected mayor on November 15, 2014, succeeding Darwin Wren. Sherry Berringer was elected as school trustee for a third term, sitting on the board of School District 59.School District 59 (2005). The city funds a volunteer fire department headed by full-time fire chief Dustin Curry. Tumbler Ridge is part of the Peace River South provincial electoral district, represented, since 2013, by Mike Bernier in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Prior to Bernier, the riding was represented by Blair Lekstrom who was elected in the 2001 provincial election, with 72% support from the town's pollsElections BC (2001). and re-elected in 2005 with 64%Elections BC (2005). and in 2009 with 70% support.Elections BC (2009). Before Lekstrom, Peace River South was represented by Jack Weisgerber as a member of the Social Credit Party of British Columbia (1986‚Äì1994) and Reform Party of British Columbia (1994‚Äì2001). In 1996, as leader of the Reform Party, Weisgerber won re-election despite the Tumbler Ridge polls placing him second to the New Democratic Party candidate.Elections BC (1996). Federally, Tumbler Ridge is in the Prince George‚ÄîPeace River riding, represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Conservative Party Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer. Before Zimmer, who was elected in May 2011, the riding was represented by Jay Hill since 1993. The riding was represented by Frank Oberle of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1972 to 1993. Oberle served as Canada's Minister of Science and Technology in 1985 and Minister of Forestry in 1989.

In 2017 he was appointed Vice Provost of Educational Technologies of New York University (NYU), after serving as Chief Information Officer at NYU Shanghai from 2014 to 2017. He also is an associate professor at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute and Associate Arts Professor at the Tisch School of the Arts' Interactive Telecommunications Program. His courses address, among other things, the interrelated effects of the topology of social networks and technological networks, how our networks shape culture and vice versa. He has written and been interviewed about the Internet since 1996. His columns and writings have appeared in Business 2.0, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Harvard Business Review and Wired. Shirky divides his time between consulting, teaching, and writing on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies. His consulting practice is focused on the rise of decentralized technologies such as peer-to-peer, web services, and wireless networks that provide alternatives to the wired client‚Äìserver infrastructure that characterizes the World Wide Web. He is a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's advisory board. In The Long Tail, Chris Anderson calls Shirky \\"a prominent thinker on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies.\\" Education and career Photograph of Shirky taken by Creative Commons chairman and MIT Media Laboratory former director Joi Ito. After graduating from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in fine art in 1986, he moved to New York. In the 1990s he founded the Hard Place Theater, a theatre company that produced non-fiction theater using only found materials such as government documents, transcripts and cultural records and also worked as a lighting designer for other theater and dance companies, including the Wooster Group, Elevator Repair Service and Dana Reitz. During this time, Shirky was vice-president of the New York chapter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and wrote technology guides for Ziff Davis. He appeared as an expert witness on cyberculture in Shea v. Reno, a case cited in the U. S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Communications Decency Act in 1996. Shirky was the first Professor of New Media in the Media Studies department at Hunter College, where he developed the MFA in Integrated Media Arts program. In the Fall of 2010, Shirky was a visiting Morrow Lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government instructing a course titled: \\"New Media and Public Action\\". Views In his book Here Comes Everybody, Shirky explains how he has long spoken in favor of crowdsourcing and collaborative efforts online. He uses the phrase \\"the Internet runs on love\\" to describe the nature of such collaborations.The Internet Runs on Love: Here Comes Everybody , SuperNova Talk In the book, he discusses the ways in which the action of a group adds up to something more than just aggregated individual action borrowing the phrase \\"more is different\\" from physicist Philip Warren Anderson. Shirky asserts that collaborative crowdsourced work results from \\"a successful fusion of a plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain with the users.\\" He states that the promise of what the user will get out of participating in a project leads to a person's desire to get involved. Collaborators will then choose the best social networking tool to do the job. One that \\"must be designed to fit the job being done, and it must help people do something they actually want to do.\\" The bargain, Shirky states, defines what collaborators expect from each other's participation in the project. Shirky's 'Promise, Tool, Bargain' premise restates aspects of the Uses and Gratifications Theory of mass media research. He points to four key steps. The first is sharing, a sort of ‚Äúme-first collaboration‚Äù in which the social effects are aggregated after the fact; people share links, URLs, tags, and eventually come together around a type. This type of sharing is a reverse of the so-called old order of sharing, where participants congregate first and then share (examples include Flickr, and Delicious). The second is conversation, that is, the synchronization of people with each other and the coming together to learn more about something and to get better at it. The third is collaboration, in which a group forms under the purpose of some common effort. It requires a division of labor, and teamwork. It can often be characterized by people wanting to fix a market failure, and is motivated by increasing accessibility. The fourth and final step is collective action, which Shirky says is ‚Äúmainly still in the future.‚Äù The key point about collective action is that the fate of the group as a whole becomes important. Shirky also introduces his theory of mass amateurization: Combined with the lowering of transaction costs associated with creating content, mass amateurization of publishing changes the question from \\"Why publish this?\\" to \\"Why not?\\" Tied to mass amateurization is the idea of publish-then-filter which is now required due to the mere size and amount of material being created on a daily basis. Shirky calls this mass amateurization of filtering a forced move. He uses the Portland Pattern Repository, which introduced the wiki concept that inspired Wikipedia, as an example of this new marriage of mass content creation and mass filtering. In 2010 Shirky published Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age which expands on themes introduced in Here Comes Everybody. The book follows concepts he introduced in a Web 2. 0 conference presentation April 23, 2008 called \\"Gin, Television, and Social Surplus\\", Herein he popularizes the concept of cognitive surplus, the time freed from watching television which can be enormously productive when applied to other social endeavors. Technology has turned many past consumers into producers. This new production capacity, combined with humanity's willingness to share, can change society if applied to civic endeavors. Shirky introduces Cognitive Surplus as a continuation of his work in Here Comes Everybody. \\"This book picks up where that one left off, starting with the observation that the wiring of humanity lets us treat free time as a shared global resource, and lets us design new kinds of participation and sharing that take advantage of that resource.\\" Shirky has also written about \\"algorithmic authority,\\" which describes the process through which unverified information is vetted for its trustworthiness through multiple sources. =Institutions vs collaboration= In July 2005, Shirky gave a talk titled \\"Institutions vs collaboration\\" as a part of TEDGlobal 2005. This presentation reveals many of the ideas and concepts that would ultimately be presented in Here Comes Everybody and in future TED talks. Shirky compares the coordination costs between groups formed under traditional institutions and those formed by groups which \\"build cooperation into the infrastructure.\\" Classic institutions have to create economic, management, legal and physical structures and inherently, by creating these rigid structures, must exclude large numbers of people. Companies like Flickr, however, having built \\"cooperation into the infrastructure\\" of their company, do not have to build massive infrastructure nor exclude large groups of potential contributors. Shirky states that since many social systems follow the Pareto principle wherein 20% of contributors account for 80% of contributions, traditional institutions lose out of the long tail of contributors by turning only the few that dominate the distribution into employees. The cooperative infrastructure model escapes having to lose this resource. Shirky presents an institution as enabler and institution as obstacle concept. The relatively small number of high-volume contributors can be assimilated, as employees, into the old-style corporate model and thus can live in an \\"institution-as-enabler world\\". The long tail of contributors, however, who make few and infrequent contributions, see institutions as an obstacle as they would never have been hired, therefore, disenfranchised. Shirky argues that an idea or contribution may be infrequent and significant. Furthermore, all of the long tail contributors, taken in aggregate, can be substantial. One pitfall of the \\"mass amateurs\\" creating their own groups is that not all niches that are filled will be positive ones; Shirky presents pro-ana groups as an example. Shirky closes by stating that the migration from institutions to self-organizing, collaborative groups will be incomplete and will not end in a utopian society. Rather, chaos will follow as was created by the advent of the printing press before it, and that this period of transition will last roughly fifty years. Shirky claims that our actions and behavior are generated by convenience. Writer and analyst Megan Garber writes: ‚ÄúThe more people we have participating in media, and the more people we have consuming it‚Äîand the more people we have, in particular, creating it‚Äîthe better. Not because bigger is implicitly better than the alternative compact, but because abundance changes the value proposition of media as a resource.\\" According to Jay Baer by making collaboration more convenient for the user, it will eventually become a more commonplace. Further, enhancing the outcome of collaboration will instill motivation within the users. According to Audrey Tang, Shirky has pioneered the notion of a \\"cognitive surplus\\", to describe the way that time spent on the internet can have an increasing social value.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source- enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang =Evolution of asymmetric media= In June 2009, Shirky participated in a TED@State talk titled \\"How cellphones, Twitter and Facebook can make history\\" aka \\"How social media can make history.\\" In the talk, he explains that this is the first time in history that communication is possible from many to many. In the past, communication to a large group excluded the possibility of having a conversation, and having a conversation meant not interacting with a group and instead was necessarily a one-to-one structure. Shirky labels this incongruous exchange as asymmetric. In Shirky's view, this feature is one of the main reasons that the internet revolution is different from communication revolutions that preceded it. The second difference between the twentieth and twenty-first century communication revolution, Shirky states, is now all media is digitized. This means that the Internet now encapsulates all forms of media from the past and the medium itself has become the site of exchange, not just a means of exchange. Finally, the Internet allows people to create content, thus the line between producers and consumers has become blurred. As Shirky puts it, \\"Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape, a new producer joins as well.\\" Even countries like China, as Shirky gives as an example, go to great lengths to control information exchange on the Internet but are having trouble as the \\"amateurization\\" of media creation has effectively turned every owner of a cellphone and Twitter account into a journalist. The populace as a whole, Shirky claims, is a force much harder to control than a handful of professional news sources. He compares the \\"Great Firewall of China\\" to the Maginot Line as both were built to protect from external threats but that is not where the majority of content is being created in this new media landscape. As an example of the potential of this two-way, collaborative environment Shirky believes we are now living in, he presents as a case study MyBarackObama.com. Over the issue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, members of the website were upset over Obama's announcement that he was changing his stance and that now he was going to sign the bill \\"that granted immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons.\\" Despite the disagreement between the President and the posters opposed to his altered view, Shirky cites the mere fact that the President posted a reply to their concerns, instead of persecuting/ignoring the group, as hope for the future of this new form of mass media. =Shirky principle= In April 2010, Kevin Kelly cited the phrase \\"Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution\\", and called it the \\"Shirky Principle\\", as the phrasing reminded him of the clarity of the Peter Principle. =Communal value vs civic value= In June 2010, Shirky participated in TED@Cannes wherein he spoke about cognitive surplus and its role furthering communal and civic value. The talk was titled, \\"How cognitive surplus will change the world,\\" and the possibility for change, which Shirky presents, runs the spectrum at one end with communal value being increased and at the other end with civic value being furthered. Digital technology has allowed human generosity and \\"the world's free time and talents,\\" which Shirky calls cognitive surplus, to combine and create a new form of creative expression. This creative expression can take the form of lolcats or endeavors such as Ushahidi; the former Shirky says increases communal value, \\"it is created by the participants for each other\\" for simple amusement, whereas the latter he cites furthers civic value meaning the group action is taken to benefit society as a whole. Shirky then presents the view that society lives under social constraint and that these social constraints can create a culture that is \\"more generous than\\" the environment created by contractual constraints alone. Understanding where the economic or contractual motivation of a situation ends and where the social part begins, Shirky claims is key when designing to maximize generosity. This being the case, to have society use its \\"trillion hours a year of participatory value\\" to advance civic value, society itself simply needs to prize, and collectively praise, endeavors like Ushahidi. Clay Shirky wrote an essay about the aspects of online community building through broadcast media. As members of a broad social community and users of media outlets, Shirky suggests ways in which we can build up this type of society. Shirky suggests five different things to think about when dealing with broadcast media outlets: Audiences are built. Communities grow. Communities face a tradeoff between size and focus. Participation matters more than quality. You may own the software, but the community owns itself. The community will want to build. Help it, or at least let it. =Response to Evgeny Morozov on consulting for the Libyan government= In March 2011, Shirky responded to questions raised by Evgeny Morozov about consulting he had done for the Libyan government. Morozov tweeted \\"With Clay Shirky consulting the Libyan govt, it's now clear why dictators are so smart about the Web\\". Shirky explained he had been invited in 2007 to speak in Boston to Libya's IT Minister. Shirky stated the talk was \\"about using social software to improve citizen engagement in coastal towns. The idea was that those cities would be more economically successful if local policies related to the tourist trade were designed by the locals themselves.\\" Shirky added that nothing came of the project beyond his initial talk. He defended his underlying desire to expand representative government in Libya and concluded that \\"the best reason to believe that social media can aid citizens in their struggle to make government more responsive is that both citizens and governments believe that.\\" =Reaction to SOPA= In January 2012, at TED Salon NY, Shirky gave a talk titled \\"Why SOPA is a bad idea.\\" He cites SOPA as a way for traditional, mass media producers to \\"raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs.\\" After an offending internet site is identified, with the identification process itself not specified in the bill, the targeted site will be removed from the Domain Name System (DNS). Shirky claims since you can still use the static IP address of the site in question, removal from DNS is futile. He identifies the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 as a law that was able to delineate between sharing with your friends as being legal and selling for commercial gain as illegal. Unsatisfied, media companies, Shirky claims, continued to push government to create more sweeping legislation which would hinder any form of sharing. This pressure, in 1998, created the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was now legal for media companies to sell uncopyable material although uncopyable digital material does not exist. To remedy this fact, Shirky states that media companies now tried to break consumer's computer hardware to create the illusion that the media they purchased was indeed uncopyable. Whereas DMCA was \\"surgical,\\" SOPA is \\"nuclear\\" since the law stipulates any sites pointing to \\"illegal\\" content may be censored. Ultimately, Shirky points out the public- at-large is by far the largest producers of content and they are the ones which will be censured. They will be presumed guilty until they can prove the content they published is not illegal. This turns the American legal system on its head. He closes by encouraging Americans to contact their senators and congressmen and reminding them they prefer \\"not to be treated like a thief.\\" =Distributed version control and democracy= On June 29, 2012, Shirky participated in Session 12: Public Sphere of TEDGlobal 2012. Shirky made the observation that many of the technological advancements in communication throughout history, from the printing press to the television, were heralded as harbingers of world peace yet ended up creating greater dissent. \\"The more ideas there are in circulation, the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.\\" However, Shirky claims, with this increased \\"arguing,\\" comes an increased \\"speed\\" of information exchange. Shirky cites \\"The Invisible College\\" as an example of a group that was able to utilize this effect created by the printing press, via the scientific journal, to help launch the scientific revolution. He then states we are in a similar period today with open-source programmers and their use of distributed version control or DVCS. DVCS, he argues, allows for \\"more arguments\\" to be made into \\"better arguments\\". DVCS also allows for \\"cooperation without coordination\\" which Shirky states is \\"the big change\\". He then suggests that DVCS fits naturally with law as it, and software development, are \\"dependency-related.\\" Shirky presents another application for DVCS ‚Äì drafting legislation. He cites Open Legislation,\\"nysenate/OpenLegislation\\". GitHub. Accessed 10 October 2017 a listing of legislative information from the New York State Senate and Assembly, as an early step in that direction. The talk culminates with Shirky posing the open question of whether or not government will transition from striving towards one-way transparency to mutual collaboration and suggests if it does, there is already a \\"new form of arguing\\" centered around DVCS to aid the transition.

The summit party comprised Richard Grant, Chris Bonington, and Sherpa Ang Nyima. In terms of elevation, isolation (distance to a higher summit, namely Annapurna I East Peak, ) and prominence (), Annapurna II does not rank far behind Annapurna I Main, which serves as the western anchor. It is a fully independent peak, despite the close association with Annapurna I Main which its name implies. Annapurna II is the 16th highest mountain in the world.

It is a terminal for the BC Ferries route across the inlet to Saltery Bay, linking the Lower Sunshine Coast with the Upper Sunshine Coast. Earls Cove is the at the north end of the Sechelt Peninsula and on the east side of the mouth of Jervis Inlet, adjacent to Agamemnon Channel, across which is Nelson Island. The BC Ferries docks BC Ferry arriving at Earls Cove Origin of name Earls Cove was named indirectly after an early pioneer of the area, Mr. Earl: the name was officialized in the plural form (rather than the possessive \\"Earl's\\") at the request of the community, as there were several families named Earl in the area. Access and transportation Earls Cove is accessed by ferry terminal and paved highway. From the Lower Mainland, BC Ferries provides service from Horseshoe Bay to Langdale. From Langdale, Highway 101 runs to the end of the Sunshine Coast at the community of Lund; Earls Cove, and the ferry from Earls Cove to Saltery Bay, is approximately midway between Langdale and Lund. The distance from Vancouver to Earls Cove is 136 kilometres (85 mi). The ferry trip across the mouth of Jervis Inlet provides passengers with scenery little changed from when Captain George Vancouver explored the area in 1792. =Earls Cove Ferry Terminal= The Earls Cove Ferry Terminal is a BC Ferries terminal with two berths that links Highway 101 across Jervis Inlet to Saltery Bay. Known as the Sechelt ‚Äì Powell River (Earls Cove‚ÄìSaltery Bay) ferry, it is about long and serviced by the MV Island Sky. The trip by ferry from Earls Cove to Saltery Bay takes about 50 minutes. Climate The Sunshine Coast lives up to its name - generally winters are mild and wet, and the summers drier than many other coastal areas. Average temperatures range from 4¬∞C (39¬∞F) in January to 18¬∞C (64¬∞F) in July. Average rainfall is about 100 cm (39 in); mild weather patterns mean that snowfall in the area is very light. The temperate climate has made this a popular area for retirees and vacationers looking for outdoor recreational opportunities of all sorts. Attractions Nearby Sakinaw and Ruby Lakes are noted for their trout fishing in season. They are also freshwater havens for canoers and kayakers. Ruby Lake Lagoon is home to over 80 species of birds, and to other animals. Wildlife watchers can observe Wood Duck, painted turtles, beavers, otters, elk, deer and bears. The northern terminus of the Suncoaster Trail, a 33 km (21 mi) trail popular with hikers and bikers, is at Klein Lake, just east of Earls Cove. NIHO Land & Cattle Company (owners of recreational land) strongly recommend before attempting any hike in this region you first purchase a hiking guide from a local bookstore. There are several provincial parks in the area, including Musket Island Marine Park. Ambrose Lake Ecological Reserve preserves a small coastal lake, adjacent bogland, and surrounding forest, and is open to the public for non-destructive pursuits like hiking, nature observation and photography.

Some well-known Kafi poets are Baba Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast and Khwaja Ghulam Farid. This poetry style has also lent itself to the Kafi genre of singing, popular throughout South Asia, especially Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Over the years, both Kafi poetry and its rendition have experienced rapid growth phases as various poets and vocalists added their own influences to the form, Tribute: The legendary maestro by Shaikh Aziz, Dawn (newspaper), 05 Jul, 2009. creating a rich and varied poetic form, yet through it all it remained centered on the dialogue between the Soul and the Creator, symbolized by the murid (disciple) and his Murshid (Master), and often by lover and his Beloved. The word Kafi is derived from the Arabic kafa meaning group. The genre is said to be derived from the Arabic poetry genre, qasidah, a monorhyme ode that is always meant to be sung, using one or two lines as a refrain that is repeated to create a mood. Kafi poetry is usually themed around heroic and great romantic tales from the folkfore, often used as a metaphor for mystical truths, and spiritual longing.Kafi South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, by Peter J. Claus, Sarah Diamond, Margaret Ann Mills. Taylor & Francis, 2003. . p. 317.Kafi Crossing boundaries, by Geeti Sen. Orient Blackswan, 1998. . p. 133. Kafi singing In musical terms, kafi refers to the genre of Punjabi and Sindhi classical music which utilizes the verses of kafi poets such as Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain. Kafi music is devotional music, normally associated with the Sufi orders or Tariqah of Islam in South Asia, and was sung by dervishes or fakirs (Islamic mendicants), solo or in groups, as an offering to their murshid, spiritual guide. It is characterized by a devotional intensity in its delivery, and as such overlaps considerably with the Qawwali genre. Just like Qawwali, its performances often took place at the dargahs (mausoleums) of various Sufi saints in the region. However, unlike Qawwali, the musical arrangement is much simpler and may only include one harmonium, one tabla, one dholak and a single vocalist. The emphasis remains on the words rather than the music itself, since the central aim of Kafi music is to convey the essence of the mystical lyrics. The central verse is often repeated. There are no fixed styles of singing of Kafi. Traditionally dervishes in Sindh used instruments like Yaktaro, a one-stringed plucked instrument, and wooden clappers, chappars, though many contemporary singers have chosen their own variations Rise of Kafi singing Some of the early notable exponents of this form in the 1930s, when classical singing became highly popular, were Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana, who used the dhrupad style in his rendition of Sindhi Kafis, and his contemporary in Sindhi kafi singing, Ustad Allahdino Noonari, who used the fusion form. Kafi has gained a higher profile in the West in the late 20th century, thanks to the Pakistani singer Abida Parveen, who, like qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, has performed in front of the Western audiences. Sanam Marvi from Hyderabad is another singer and vocalist, performing Kafi based Sufi songs.

It is the economic and symbolic center of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area. History and redevelopment Reinvestment in the area in the mid-1990s spurred a rebirth in Downtown, with the residential population growing from 7,261 in 1990 to 9,599 in 2000 and 11,693 in 2010. It had the largest population growth, by percentage, of any Cleveland neighborhood over that time. The neighborhood's population was estimated at 15,000 in September 2017 (of which slightly more than 800 were owner-occupied condominiums), with another 1,000 rental units becoming available by the end of 2017. The Downtown Cleveland Alliance, a nonprofit which promotes the area, said that the neighborhood's population will hit more than 20,000+ by 2020 when all 17 anticipated housing projects were completed, making it one of the most populated downtown districts of cities of its size. Between 2010 and 2014, Downtown Cleveland saw more than $4.5 billion in residential and commercial developments. In 2012, Forbes included Downtown Cleveland in a list of \\"15 U.S. Cities Emerging Downtown\\". As of 2000, 100,000 people worked in the district, which in 2012 contained more than 16 million square feet of rentable office space.  Public Square  The heart of downtown and the city's first settled area, Public Square was laid out by city founder Moses Cleaveland in 1796 and has remained largely unchanged.Cleveland: A Concise History, 1796-1996 (pg 7), 1997 It consists of a large open space, cut into quadrants by Ontario Street and Superior Avenue. Public Square is the symbolic heart of the city, and has hosted presidents, vast congregations of people, and a free annual 4th of July concert by the Cleveland Orchestra. At one time, Public Square was fenced off and inaccessible to vehicles. In 1860, the Perry Monument, a memorial to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's victory in the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, was dedicated in the center of Public Square. In 1892, it was moved out of the square, which by then had the fences removed after lobbying by commercial interests. Public Square is also home to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, which commemorates residents of Cuyahoga County who served in the Civil War. Public Square also features a statue of Cleaveland; a statue of Tom L. Johnson, the city's most famous mayor; a large amount of shrubbery and other landscaping; and a large public fountain. The Consulate-General of Slovenia in Cleveland is in the 55 Public Square building.\\"Welcome on a webpage of the Consulate General of the Republic of Slovenia in Cleveland, USA..\\" Consulate-General of Slovenia in Cleveland. Retrieved on January 31, 2009. Notable buildings on Public Square include the Terminal Tower, home to Tower City Center, 200 Public Square - the former BP Building (renamed in 2005), as well as Key Tower, the tallest building in Ohio and one of the tallest in the United States. Public Square is also home to the historic Old Stone Church, completed in 1855. The west side of Public Square was to become the headquarters of the Cleveland Trust Company, then called Ameritrust, but the project was cancelled after Ameritrust was purchased and merged into Key Bank, leaving that side of the square open to this day, with only a surface parking lot on the site. The classic Higbee's department store building is home to the Jack Cleveland Casino, since its opening on May 14, 2012.  Historic Warehouse District  St. Clair Avenue in the Historic Warehouse District Originally an early residential neighborhood, The Warehouse District was built into a warehousing and shipping neighborhood during the industrial rise of Cleveland, Within the past few decades, it has been converted again back into an entertainment, dining, and residential hub. The Warehouse District is the largest downtown neighborhood by population, and continues to grow with an assortment of shops, clubs, bars, and loft condos/apartments. West Sixth Street is known as the heart of the district. Famously, the 17-story Rockefeller Building sits on the corner West Sixth and Superior Ave erected by John D. Rockefeller. The Historic Gateway District. Winter on East 4th Street.  Historic Gateway District  Revitalization of the Historic Gateway District began in the 1990s with the Gateway complex, which included construction of Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the homes of the MLB Cleveland Indians, NBA Cleveland Cavaliers, and AHL Cleveland Monsters. The Gateway complex was built on parking lots on the site of a former produce market. The baseball stadium and basketball arena are connected to Tower City Center, and RTA's rail transit system, via an enclosed walkway. The neighborhood includes retail, housing, and a large variety of restaurants. East 4th Street District East 4th Street is a popular restaurant and entertainment street near Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. It is home to Cleveland's House of Blues, Iron Chef Michael Symon's Lola Bistro, comedy club/restaurant Pickwick and Frolic, as well as a dozen other dining and retail storefronts. The neighborhood is home to hundreds of residents who live in the apartments and loft condominiums above the storefronts. The neighborhood also houses the Cleveland Arcade, the first indoor shopping mall in the United States.  Theater District  Playhouse Square's Ohio Theater. Home to the second-largest performing arts complex in the U.S., Playhouse Square Center in the Cleveland Theater District is downtown's cultural heart. The area is dominated by five historic theaters built during the 1920s -- State, Ohio, Allen, Hanna, and Palace theaters are all located in a cluster near the intersection of Euclid Avenue and E. 14th Street. Additionally, the smaller theaters include the 14th Street Theater, Kennedy's Theater, Westfield Insurance Studio Theater, Second Stage, and Helen Rosenfeld Lewis Bialosky Lab Theatre. WVIZ-TV 25 (PBS), WCPN FM 90.3 (NPR), and classical music station WCLV FM 104.9 (collectively known as \\"Ideastream\\") teamed up with Playhouse Square to renovate the former Playhouse Square Building, an empty office building, transforming it into One Playhouse Square, a downtown broadcast headquarters. The building is now known as the Idea Center, and includes high definition television studios, control rooms, radio studios, and performance space fronting Euclid Avenue, as well as a variety of high-tech business startups and other tenants located on the building's upper floors. Residents of the district include Cleveland Playhouse and Cleveland State University performing arts. In spring 2014, a $16 million outdoor streetscape transformation was completed. Focusing primarily on lighting and signage, a centerpiece of a 4,600-piece LED crystal chandelier hangs over the Euclid Ave and East 14th Street intersection 24-feet off the ground. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is the largest outdoor chandelier in the world. Other additions include four gateway signs spanning entry points, a large 1920s-era \\"Playhouse Square\\" sign at East 13th Street and Euclid Ave intersection, a fire pit at Star Plaza, a 28-foot-tall digital display, and architectural lighting to show off details of the historic buildings.  Civic Center  Cleveland City Hall The Civic Center district holds Cleveland's governmental and public buildings. The most visible structure is the Justice Center Complex, consisting of the Cleveland Police Department headquarters and Cuyahoga County Jail. Other notable structures include Cleveland City Hall, Cuyahoga County and Cleveland Municipal Courts, Public Auditorium, Cleveland Public Library main buildings, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse, and the Cleveland Metropolitan School District administration building. The Public Malls, Malls A, B, and C, also known as the Burnham Malls, hold public green space and gardens fronting the lake. The Fountain of Eternal Life, also known as the War Memorial Fountain, is centered on the Mall A. On the western edge, Willard Park is host to the controversial public art, known as the Free Stamp. On the eastern edge sits Fort Huntington Park, containing a statue of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry commemorating the Battle of Lake Erie, a statue of Clevelander Jesse Owens, and the Cleveland Police Department memorial of officers killed in the line of duty. A major addition to the area is the $465 million Global Center for Health Innovation and Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland.  Nine- Twelve District  Reserve Square Apartments. Cleveland's financial district, the area around East 9th street from Lake Erie south to Prospect Avenue, serves as corporate or regional home to many firms in the financial, business, legal, communications and publishing sectors of the city's economy. Architecturally, the area is characterized by large, glass office towers built predominately in the 1950s to 1980s. The tallest is Erieview Tower at 40-stories, the centerpiece of the largely unbuilt Erieview Urban Renewal Project of the 1960s. The Galleria was added to the tower in the 1980s originally as a shopping mall, but today serves as a mix of small stores, office space, gardens under the glass, radio headquarters, and a food court. The 31-story One Cleveland Center is nicknamed the \\"silver chisel\\" due to its distinct shape. The seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, is located at the heart of the district on E.9th. There is a large cluster of high-rise downtown housing in this area, largely concentrated in the East 12th Street area. Alexander Mann's U.S. headquarters and Medical Mutual headquarters are present here. The City Club of Cleveland is housed in the City Club Building, which is at the corner of East Ninth and Euclid. WKYC, the local NBC affiliate, has its broadcast center on Lakeside Avenue on the northern end of the district. WOIO, the CBS affiliate, and WUAB, the CW affiliate, both owned by Gray Television are housed in Reserve Square on East 12th Street. Good Karma Broadcasting houses its two stations, WWGK and WKNR, inside the Galleria at Erieview. =Short Vincent= East 9th Street with the Roxy Burlesque in 1973. Short Vincent, located between East 6th and East 9th Street, is short street that once served as one of Cleveland's major entertainment districts and a center for the city's nightlife. Densely packed with restaurants, dive bars, jazz clubs, and bounded by the risqu√© Roxy Burlesque Theater and the art deco Bond Clothing Store, the district first emerged in the late 1920s and reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Short Vincent became the \\"gathering place for gamblers, sports figures, racketeers, lawyers, and newspapermen\\" and \\"offered good food, underworld gossip, and the odds on anything.\\" The street's Theatrical Grill served as the \\"headquarters\\" for notorious mobster Shondor Birns, but also hosted visiting celebrities such as Judy Garland and Dean Martin. Mobster Danny Greene and boxing promoter Don King were also regulars on the Short Vincent. The north side of the street was considered the \\"respectable\\" side, while the south side was a center for the numbers racket and was \\"studded with girlie shows.\\" The pavement between the two sides \\"was referred to as the Gaza Strip.\\" The area fell into decline by the 1960s and 1970s and disappeared as an entertainment district with the expansion of National City Bank and the demolition of long-time Short Vincent establishments in the late 1970s. Today the street forms part of the Nine-Twelve District.  North Coast Harbor District  North Coast Harbor and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Great Lakes Science Center, Cleveland Browns Stadium, Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum and the USS Cod, North Coast Harbor is the tourist district of downtown Cleveland. The North Coast District is home to the city's port, although there are long-term plans to move the port west of the river and open up the area for housing and lakefront development. North Coast is also the former home of Cleveland Stadium. The city was once known to some as the \\"Mistake on the Lake\\" although this pejorative has fallen out of common use. Cleveland Stadium was torn down after the former Cleveland Browns franchise left the city in 1995, and was replaced with FirstEnergy Stadium, which serves as the home of the reborn NFL football franchise. Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport is located east of the Rock Hall, and serves as a commuter and business airport that reduces small aircraft traffic at the larger Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, located southwest of downtown. The district fronts Lake Erie on the north and also includes Voinovich Park and a fishing pier. Plans for the city's lakefront include adding thousands of housing units, retail shops, a marina, and other amenities to North Coast Harbor, see \\"Lakefront Plan\\" below.  Campus District  School of Communication at CSU with the Rhodes Tower in background The Campus District is a downtown Cleveland neighborhood just east of the central business district. The district is bordered by Lakeside Avenue to the north, Broadway Avenue to the south, East 17th Street to the west and East 30th Street to the east. Members of the Campus District include Cleveland State University, St. Vincent Charity Medical Center, Cuyahoga Community College and more. Cleveland State University has in past years been derided as an open enrollment commuter school, but has moved to dispel that belief. The university is progressing through a master plan to raise standards, enrollment, and rebuild its fortress-like campus. CSU plans to build a college town adjacent to downtown, including new retail, restaurants and housing to serve an increase of resident students planned to be in the thousands. The university's desire to attract more traditional college students and begin to raise its stature as a research university figure into these plans a great deal, and CSU opened its second residence hall, a complete retrofit of Fenn Tower, in the fall of 2006. Over the past decade, CSU has partnered with the city and other area stakeholders to transfer technology research into startup companies and enterprises, improving the economy of the area and stimulating downtown life in the Quadrangle. As part of CSU, the Wolstein Center, formerly the CSU Convocation Center, is located in the Campus District, and serves as the home of CSU Men's Basketball and various concerts and special events throughout the year.  Flats district  The Flats The Cuyahoga River splits The Flats in half where the two sides are referred to appropriately as the East Bank of the Flats and the West Bank of the Flats. While the East Bank of the Flats was once the popular nightlife district in Ohio, its demise in the early 2000s spurred a complete redevelopment where a majority of the existing buildings were demolished. In its place, an 8-story Aloft Hotel and a 21-story office tower were built. Restaurants, apartments, and a riverside promenade are planned for Phase II of this mixed-use project. The West Bank of the Flats contains the majority of the district's residential population, primary stemming from a set of apartments and condos known as Stonebridge. The areas also boasts bars, restaurants, jet ski rental, strip clubs, and, most recently, the home of the Greater Cleveland Aquarium. Historically significant, the Flats were the place Moses Cleaveland first landed when he founded the city. It was also the location of some of the earliest populations of Cleveland. Throughout much of Cleveland history, it became almost entirely industrial. By the 1980s, it had become the famous nightlife area that lasted until the early 2000s. The current state of the Flats is in mixed-use redevelopment.  New developments and projects =Euclid Corridor= Cleveland's Main Street, Euclid Avenue, and Terminal Tower. The $197 million Euclid Corridor Transportation Project connected downtown, Midtown, and University Circle by introducing bus rapid transit (BRT) to the city in the form of the HealthLine. The project involved a total reconstruction of Euclid Avenue from Public Square to beyond University Circle (located approximately east of downtown), and included bus-only lanes with center-median station boarding, priority signaling, and fast commute times. In addition to transit and road improvements, the transportation project also invested heavily in the Euclid Avenue streetscape, rebuilding the street from storefront to storefront, removing old vaults and streetcar tracks, and building new sidewalks, lighting, and landscaping. The project included a large public arts component, with different areas of the Euclid Corridor route being addressed by local and national artists. The project is expected to spur investments in residential, retail, office, and mixed-use redevelopments, including over 4,000 residential units along the corridor. In addition to the BRT line, the Downtown Cleveland Alliance funded a study on retail feasibility on the avenue, focusing on the area between CSU and Public Square.The Plain Dealer, Business C1. March 30, 2007. Global Center for Health Innovation and Cleveland Convention Center Global Center for Health Innovation under construction in 2012. The window shape is meant to mimic DNA structure. A $465 million Global Center for Health Innovation, previously known as the Medical Mart, and Cleveland Convention Center opened in the summer of 2013. The 1.1-million-square-foot campus consists of a 235,000-square-foot Global Center for Health Innovation and a 750,000-square-foot Convention Center. The LEED Silver-certified Convention Center includes a 225,928-square-foot exhibit hall divisible into three halls, as well as 46,166 square feet of total ballroom space, made up of three grand ballrooms totaling 32,193 square feet and two junior ballrooms totaling 10,937 square feet. Views of Lake Erie from a 9,520-square-foot patio completes the northern border of the complex. The project was funded by a 0.25 percent increase in Cuyahoga County sales tax. Permanent tenants include Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, Philips Healthcare, GE Healthcare, Johnson Controls, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals. Flats East Bank A multiphase, $500 million mixed-use redevelopment along the East Bank of the Flats is being developed and financed by the Wolstein Group and Fairmount Properties. = Phase I = Opening in June 2013, the $275 million first phase included a 23-story office tower, 8-story Aloft hotel, restaurants, and a 16,000 sq. ft. health club, The office tower has been named the \\"Ernst and Young building.\\" The two anchor tenants include the law firm Tucker Ellis and West, and the largest tenant, Ernst and Young. The 450,000 sq. ft. office tower is all Class A office space and features a green, open-air rooftop terrace. The initial opening restaurants and bars included Ken Stewart's, Lago, Flip Side and Wileyville. Two Waterfront Line Rapid stations, Settlers Landing station and Main Avenue station received $375,000 upgrades. Work at both stations includes replacing brick and concrete pavers, repairing the glass shelters, and demolishing ticket booths. At Settlers Landing, crews will restore eight etched glass panels that act as wind screens. The artwork depicts scenes of Cleveland's settlement and the evolution of transportation. = Phase II = Several Restaurants (Alley Cat, Crop East Bank), bars (Beerheads, Punch Bowl Social), 1200-foot boardwalk, and 243 Apartments opened as a part of Phase 2 in 2015. West Bank of the Flats A $33 million Greater Cleveland Aquarium opened on Jan 21, 2012, located at the FirstEnergy Powerhouse as the only freestanding aquarium in the state of Ohio. The aquarium takes up 70,000 square feet in the powerhouse's basement and contains over a million gallons of water in 42 tanks. The main feature of the aquarium is Marinescape‚Äôs Seatube¬Æ, a 145-foot-long clear tunnel, known as a Seatube. The attraction was constructed around the building's architectural characteristics‚Äîincluding its smokestacks, columns and narrow hallways. Developers were not allowed to modify the structure or paint some walls because the old complex is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Greater Cleveland Aquarium was the first in the United States by New Zealand-based developer Marinescape NZ Ltd., who has built more than 20 aquariums in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Jacobs Pavilion at Nautica is a 5000-seat outdoor amphitheater. In 2012, it underwent in $1 million upgrade that included a new entrance constructed 200 feet north of the old one, creating space for an expanded riverfront plaza. Other upgrades included new brick pavement for the plaza and new fencing. In the fall of 2010, the Trust for Public Land and the Cleveland Rowing Foundation successfully purchased seven acres of commercial riverfront land for $3.2 million. The partnership is converting the vacant concrete-covered site into Rivergate Park, a new recreational center in the Flats. Officially opened in May 2011, the park preserves public access to the Cuyahoga River for access to activities including kayaking, canoeing, rowing and dragon boating. Long term plans include a canoe/kayak launch facility, concessions, and public restrooms. Cleveland Metroparks will replace the concrete and gravel on their land and replace it with grass, trees and other park amenities. Cleveland‚Äôs Crooked River Skate Park will be built on 15,000 square feet of city owned land. It is located along the river and adjacent to the Cleveland Metroparks new Rivergate Park. The total cost is projected to be $758,000. Groundbreaking will occur in 2013. Cleveland State University expansion Cleveland State University campus continues to undergo a $500 million expansion. Recently completed projects include a new Student Center ($55 million), Euclid Commons Dorms (5 buildings costing $60 million), \\"College Town\\" (373 new residential units), Middough Building ($20 million) and College of Education and Human Services Building ($37 million), Upcoming projects include converting the Mather Mansion into a boutique hotel and the construction of a $45 million Center for Innovation in Health Professions. One block north of campus along Chester Ave, the privately developed Langston Apartments will add over 300 apartments units. The $54 million project opened Phase I in 2012, with Phase II opening in 2013. Completed Projects The corner of Euclid Ave and East Ninth Street shows the Cleveland Trust Company Building, 1010 Euclid Ave, and the base the Ameritrust Tower Relocation of the Cuyahoga County Administrative Headquarters, being developed by Geis Company, is spurring a $200 million mixed-use development at the corner of Euclid Avenue and East Ninth Street. The properties involved include the 29-story Ameritrust Tower, the attached 1010 Euclid Avenue building, the historic Cleveland Trust Company Building, and the so-called \\"P and H\\" buildings, located on the Prospect Avenue side of the complex. Additionally, two parking garages on the south side of Prospect Ave along East Ninth Street will anchor the parking aspect. The P and H buildings will be razed and the site will become the home of a new, eight- story Cuyahoga County headquarters building, in which the county will lease for 26 years. Building size is expected to be 220,000 square feet. The plan calls for creating 210 high-end apartments in the former office tower and part of the building at 1010 Euclid, although portions of the building will be retained as office space in case the county needs to expand in the future. A proposed hotel on the lower floors of the 29-story tower is being considered. The Cleveland Trust Company Rotunda and 1010 Euclid Ave ground floor will house a full-service Heinen's grocery store set to open Fall 2014. In November, 2015, another prominent Northeast Ohio retailer, Geiger's, opened a new store just east of Heinen's in the former Truman Building, now known as the Ivory. =Residential conversions and new construction= The Avenue District in June 2010 Downtown Cleveland had the largest percent population growth in the 2010 Census for the entire city of Cleveland.

The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 2016.  First house  Sunninghill Park was originally part of Windsor Forest until 1630, when King Charles I granted it to Thomas Carey. Around 1633, it was purchased by Sir Thomas Draper and sold in 1769 by his great grandson, Thomas Draper Baber, to Jeremiah Crutchley, whose family owned it until it was sold in 1936 by Percy Edward Crutchley (whose maternal grandparents were the owners of Eldon House in London, Ontario).Robin and Terry Harris, eds. The Eldon House Diaries: Five Women's views of the 19th century Toronto: Champlain Society, 1994, page 343. The first significant house was built on the estate in the late Georgian period in the early 19th century, being a stucco building of two stories with later additions. It served as the headquarters of the American Ninth Air Force from November 1943 to September 1944. The Crown Estate Commissioners purchased the property from Philip Hill in 1945. The main house was to be occupied by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after their wedding in November 1947. However, the house burned down on 30 August 1947 before their wedding, so they rented Windlesham Moor instead. In the mid-1960s, the site was considered for a new home for Princess Margaret.

The following year, construction began on a two-storey red brick house to be the home of the Duke and Duchess of York. The architect responsible was Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, Balmoral Estate Architect and Professor at Heriot-Watt University. Construction was completed in 1990. The house had six reception rooms, 12 bedrooms, and 12 bathrooms, comparable in size to most larger UK instances built since World War II. It was the first newly built royal home since Bagshot Park, which was built in 1879 for the Duke of Connaught. In the British tabloid press, the home was often referred to as 'SouthYork', a play on words for the 'Southfork' estate on the popular 1980s soap opera Dallas'. It was also \\"mocked for its resemblance to a Tesco-style supermarket\\". Following the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, it was announced that the Duke of York was to be designated her former home Royal Lodge, Windsor instead. The Duke of York and his former wife shared the family's home until 2004, when he moved to the Royal Lodge, the refurbishment of which was funded by taking out a mortgage on Sunninghill Park.

Her debut album Beloved One, released in 1993, included guitar work by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. Her second album, Regarding the Soul (1995), integrated her singing, songwriting and harp- playing. The Map (1998) was a collaboration with Mainieri. Their first child, Ruby Anna, was born on November 19, 2000. Dee also recorded a children's album, Can You Hear Lullaby (2001), which featured guest vocals Everett Bradley, Curtis King and Julie Dansky and instrumental work by her husband. Dee went back into the studio and recorded a solo album, Patch of Blue, which was released in 2005. Unlike previous work, all eight songs were originals, except Fly Away whose music was co-written with her husband, who played vibraphone on the album. Patch of Blue did not include any guitar work. Instead, it featured Dee's harp and vocals, with backing from the Tosca String Quartet and several woodwind players. Impact on harp music Dee was the first pop singer to participate in the Lyon & Healy Jazz and Pop Harp Festival (1999), sharing the stage with jazz harpists Park Stickney and Deborah Henson- Conant. Dee plays a Lyon & Healy electric harp in her recordings and live performances. Her incorporation of harp in singer-songwriter and pop music also influenced the new generation of young singer-songwriter-harpists, such as Joanna Newsom and Habiba Doorenbos.

He was an executive of the agricultural machinery company founded by his father that became International Harvester. Charles's successful stewardship of the family firm left him with the means and leisure to indulge his interests in the arts and natural sciences. His activities and benefactions in the US were centered on Chicago and Miami; he also aspired to found an art museum in Spain. Early life Mrs. Charles Deering, John Singer Sargent Deering was born July 31, 1852, in South Paris, Maine, the son of Abby Reed Barbour and William Deering. His father was a successful businessman then engaged real estate speculation and in the manufacture and sale of woolens.Carstensen, \\"William Deering.\\" In 1856, Charles's mother died, and, the following year, his father married Clara Barbour Cummings Hamilton, a cousin of his late wife. The two children of this marriage were James Deering (1859‚Äì1925) and Abby Marion Deering (later Mrs Richard Flint Howe). Charles remained close to his half-brother and sister throughout his life.Carstensen, \\"William Deering\\"; Scott and Harshe, pp. 55‚Äì59. Charles attended Kents Hill School, graduating in June 1869. At first, he set his sights on a career in the Navy. Obtaining a midshipman's warrant, he entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he graduated second in the class of 1873. He served as a naval officer until 1881, when he resigned in order to join his father's company. Naval service shaped Deering by exposing him to the cultures of Europe and Asia. He supplemented these experiences with extensive personal travel, developing cosmopolitan tastes, a cosmopolitan outlook, and a particular affinity with the arts of Spain. While still in the Navy, Charles met and married Ana Rogers Case, the daughter of Rear Admiral Augustus Ludlow Case; the couple wed in 1875 in Newport, Rhode Island. Ana Deering died October 31, 1876, shortly after giving birth to a son, Charles Case Deering (1876‚Äì1924).Scott and Harshe, pp. 3, 30‚Äì32. Deering was a gifted amateur artist, and while still in the Navy he used his free time to become acquainted with leading artists and to visit the world's great art galleries. He began a lifelong habit of collecting art, both by acknowledged masters and contemporaries. In 1876, he met the painter John Singer Sargent, who became a close friend. Other artist-friends included sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens, the Swedish artist Anders Zorn, and Catalan artist Ramon Casas i Carbo.Scott and Harshe, pp. 36‚Äì37. In 1893, Deering took time off from his other duties to study painting in Paris under Zorn for an entire season.Scott and Harshe, p. 15. Throughout his life, Deering enthusiastically supported and championed the work of many living artists while also avidly purchasing hundreds of older, more obscure works along with many acknowledged masterpieces. Business career By 1881, William Deering's business activities had shifted to Illinois, where some earlier investments had led to his founding the Deering Harvester Company.Carstensen. As it grew, he enlisted both his sons in running the company. Charles moved to Chicago, taking up permanent residence in Evanston and becoming the company's secretary. His father retired in 1901. In 1902, J. P. Morgan financed a deal that combined Deering Harvester and the company founded by Cyrus McCormick, along with several others, to form the International Harvester Company. Charles Deering became chairman of the board of the newly created company. He served in this capacity until 1910, when he retired. Art patronage and collecting Deering devoted the rest of his life to art collecting and to the creation of several estates in the United States and Europe. Deering dreamed of creating an art center in Spain,Scott and Harshe, p. 52. and in 1910 he had the Palau Maricel built with the help of the artist Miquel Utrillo i Morlius in Sitges, a town just south of Barcelona. The building was connected by a bridge across the lane to a second building he purchased, which now houses the Museu Maricel. A portrait of him by Catalan artist Ramon Casas i Carb√≥ can be seen in the museum, which is open to visitors. The Palau Maricel is also open to visitors, but only in the summer. Deering's hope was that the complex would become a magnet for artists and artistic life, where people of many nations would come to make art and study.Scott and Harshe, pp. 17‚Äì18. In addition, Deering's own large and many-sided collection of Spanish art and decorative objects would be on display. In the end, however, Deering abandoned much of this plan. Instead, much of his collection was given to the Art Institute of Chicago, while other works were transferred to his estate at Cutler, Florida.Scott and Harshe, p. 18. Florida estates Charles Deering, at Brickell Point, Miami, 1917, by John Singer Sargent. Beginning around 1890, the William Deerings began wintering in Florida, first around St. Augustine, and later in the vicinity of Miami.Rybcynski and Olin, pp. xv‚Äìxvi; Ceo and Lombard, p. 21. Visiting them, both Charles and his half-brother became deeply interested in South Florida. Around 1908, Charles purchased some 212 acres of land in Buena Vista. In 1910, he hired Clinton Mackenzie to design a Spanish-style villa for the property. He hired the great Chicago landscape architect Ossian Cole Simonds to lay out the grounds.Fairchild 1947, p. 57. Here he supported the New York Botanical Garden by providing them 25 acres to grow cacti.Rothra 1995, p. 88 Around this time, Deering made the acquaintance of botanist David Fairchild and allowed the US Department of Agriculture to establish an experimental station on 25 acres of his property. Deering became an avid naturalist and preservationist. The book Ornamental Gardening in Florida by Charles Simpson is dedicated to him.Simpson 1916, Deering correctly foresaw that development would soon engulf the Buena Vista property, and by 1913 he had begun buying land further down on the coast, along Old Cutler Road. By 1915, he had acquired several hundred acres near Cutler and moved his winter quarters there permanently. His Buena Vista estate was broken up by developers during the land boom of 1925.Fairchild 1938, p. 419. Deering built a fine stone house on his second property. Now named the Charles Deering Estate, it is open to the public as a museum and nature preserve. Meanwhile, his brother James built an estate, Villa Vizcaya, on Biscayne Bay in Coconut Grove. Charles Deering was also a member of the famous Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia. Family In 1883, Deering had married Marion Dennison Whipple, the daughter of Major General William Dennison Whipple. The Deerings had three children: Roger, Marion, and Barbara (later Mrs. Richard Ely Danielson). On July 6, 1914, Deering's daughter Marion (1887‚Äì1965) married Chauncey McCormick in Paris over his objections. After a civil ceremony, a religious rite was held at James Deering's Paris residence. Mrs. McCormick became a patron of art in Chicago and \\"one of the nation's richest women\\". Her son Brooks McCormick (1917‚Äì2006) was the last family member to head International Harvester. Death and memorial library Charles Deering died February 5, 1927, in Miami. In 1930, construction began on the Charles Deering Library at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Funding was provided primarily through donations made by the Deering, McCormick, and Danielson families. Dedicated in 1933, it served as Northwestern's primary library until 1970, when an adjacent library was constructed. The Deering Library now houses certain special collections of the Northwestern University Library, along with art, music, government information, maps, and the University Archives. Deering's son Roger (1884‚Äì1936) also was an art patron and benefactor to Northwestern.

(Face One) was also the first Sopor Aeternus album to be released in multiple formats, including a double vinyl edition and an A5-sized boxed set edition; both were limited pressings, of 500 and 3,000 copies, respectively. It was also the first to be promoted with an accompanying video.Youtube, Dead Lovers' Sarabande promo Overview Dead Lovers' Sarabande, as a whole, is a transitory death suite detailing the unnamed protagonist's mourning of her lover and her desire to rejoin him in the afterlife. Major recurring themes in the work include loneliness and the dreadful feeling of loss when someone dear dies. The story of the first part centers around Cantodea assisting her husband in committing suicide; although he is said to be suffering, the exact cause is not mentioned. In \\"Hades \\"Pluton\\"\\", she attempts to make a deal with otherworldly beings in order to recover her husband but refuses it eventually. Anna-Varney Cantodea later admitted that Dead Lovers' Sarabande was dedicated to, but not about, the late Rozz Williams, former frontman of deathrock band Christian Death. Musically, a shift was made towards folk music and chamber pieces, with more prominent passages for string instruments. For the first time, live brass and woodwinds players were used instead of synthesized instruments; the leap to organic strings occurred on The inexperienced Spiral Traveller. Whereas previous albums contained some wall of sound production techniques, (Face One) was more intimate and featured minimalist arrangements. Songs also became more drone- like, with the use of pedal tones and repeated melodies carried across several instruments; this is most notable on opener \\"Across the Bridge\\" and the album's longest piece, \\"The Sleeper\\". \\"Hades \\"Pluton\\"\\" is based on the rhythm of the Roky Erickson song, \\"Night of the Vampire\\". Dead Lovers' Sarabande (Face One) was re-released on CD with newly packaged artwork in 2004.

Highgrove House, the country residence of Anne's brother, Charles, Prince of Wales, is centred six miles away in the parish of Doughton, near Tetbury. The first cousin of their mother, HM The Queen, Prince Michael of Kent, owned nearby Nether Lypiatt Manor for 26 years from 1980.\\"News In Brief: New home for Prince Michael\\", The Guardian, London, 8 Jan 1981. History The manors of Minchinhampton and Avening formed the basis of the later Gatcombe Park estate. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries they were granted to Lord Windsor, whose family sold mostly undeveloped land by that date comprising them to Philip Sheppard in 1656. The core hillside land of the former estates, which was chiefly within the parish bounds of Gatcombe, was left in the will of Samuel Sheppard, who died in 1770, to his brother Edward. Accordingly, a new manor house was built from 1771 to 1774 for Edward Sheppard, a local clothier. The house and estate were purchased in 1814 by the successful speculator and theoretical economist David Ricardo, MP, and altered to the designs of George Basevi (a relation), c. 1820.Gatcombe Park (House), Grade II* listing It features Bath stone construction, and comprises five main bedrooms, four secondary bedrooms, four reception rooms, a library, a billiard room and a conservatory; staff accommodation and its steep-sloping grounds are a separately listed (Grade II) parkland.Gatcombe Park (Park and Garden) Grade II Residence of Princess Royal The house and home farm were bought by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976 for Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips; the price was not disclosed but is believed to have been between ¬£500,000 and ¬£750,000.Glasgow Herald, 24 June 1976, p. 1The Australian Women's Weekly, 21 July 1976, p. 4 The previous owner was Lord Butler of Saffron Walden, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a former Home Secretary, who had inherited the house from his father-in-law, the art collector Samuel Courtauld. Courtauld had acquired it from the Ricardo family in 1940.RM Hartwell, ed., Introduction, Ricardo Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (Penguin Classics 1971), p. 37 The Crown paid for the renovation and redecoration of the house for Princess Anne and Captain Phillips, who moved into it in November 1977. In 1978 the owners' land was increased by the purchase of Aston Farm to the east.Map and grade II listing of farmhouse that shows intervening Minchinhampton Golf Course and Field Farm While Princess Anne's first marriage subsisted, the property thus covered approximately , of which the bulk of its of woodland was part of the park land, including a lake containing brown trout. These properties had extensive stabling for horses, including a new stable block, and the underlying land of an airstrip is within the ownership of Aston Farm. The estate was divided when the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips were divorced, and today the princess lives at Gatcombe Park with her second husband, Sir Timothy Laurence. After the divorce, for some years Mark Phillips lived at Aston Farm with his second wife; but he later moved to America. Their children Peter and Zara Phillips each had a cottage on the estate until they married. , Peter and his wife, Autumn, were living in London. Zara and her husband, Mike Tindall, at first lived in Cheltenham after they were married in 2011, but in January 2013 they sold their house and came to live on the Gatcombe estate.\\"Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall sell home for move to Princess Royal's estate,\\" telegraph.com, 9 January 2013, accessed 11 January 2013.\\"A Life in the Day: Zara Phillips, the Queen‚Äôs eldest granddaughter\\" Sunday Times, 18 April 2015, accessed 11 June 2015.

The construction, while not functorial, is a fundamental tool in scheme theory. In this article, all rings will be assumed to be commutative and with identity. Proj of a graded ring=Proj as a set= Let S be a graded ring, where S = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\ge 0} S_i is the direct sum decomposition associated with the gradation. The irrelevant ideal of S is the ideal of elements of positive degree S_+ = \\\\bigoplus_{i > 0} S_i. We say an ideal is homogeneous if it is generated by homogeneous elements. Then, as a set, : \\\\operatorname{Proj} S = \\\\\\\\{P \\\\subset S \\\\text{ homogeneous prime ideal, } S_+ ot\\\\subset P \\\\\\\\} For brevity we will sometimes write X for \\\\operatorname{Proj} S. =Proj as a topological space= We may define a topology, called the Zariski topology, on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S by defining the closed sets to be those of the form :V(a) = \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Proj} S \\\\mid a \\\\subseteq p \\\\\\\\}, where a is a homogeneous ideal of S. As in the case of affine schemes it is quickly verified that the V(a) form the closed sets of a topology on X. Indeed, if (a_i)_{i\\\\in I} are a family of ideals, then we have \\\\bigcap V(a_i) = V \\\\left(\\\\sum a_i\\\\right) and if the indexing set I is finite, then \\\\bigcup V(a_i) = V \\\\left(\\\\prod a_i\\\\right). Equivalently, we may take the open sets as a starting point and define : D(a) = \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Proj} S \\\\mid a \\\\; ot\\\\subseteq\\\\; p \\\\\\\\}. A common shorthand is to denote D(Sf) by D(f), where Sf is the ideal generated by f. For any ideal a, the sets D(a) and V(a) are complementary, and hence the same proof as before shows that the sets D(a) form a topology on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S. The advantage of this approach is that the sets D(f), where f ranges over all homogeneous elements of the ring S, form a base for this topology, which is an indispensable tool for the analysis of \\\\operatorname{Proj} S, just as the analogous fact for the spectrum of a ring is likewise indispensable. =Proj as a scheme= We also construct a sheaf on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S, called the ‚Äústructure sheaf‚Äù as in the affine case, which makes it into a scheme. As in the case of the Spec construction there are many ways to proceed: the most direct one, which is also highly suggestive of the construction of regular functions on a projective variety in classical algebraic geometry, is the following. For any open set U of \\\\operatorname{Proj} S (which is by definition a set of homogeneous prime ideals of S not containing S_+) we define the ring O_X(U) to be the set of all functions : f \\\\colon U \\\\to \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\in U} S_{(p)} (where S_{(p)} denotes the subring of the ring of fractions S_p consisting of fractions of homogeneous elements of the same degree) such that for each prime ideal p of U: # f(p) is an element of S_{(p)}; # There exists an open subset V of U containing p and homogeneous elements s, t of S of the same degree such that for each prime ideal q of V: #* t is not in q; #* f(q) = s/t. It follows immediately from the definition that the O_X(U) form a sheaf of rings O_X on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S, and it may be shown that the pair (\\\\operatorname{Proj} S, O_X) is in fact a scheme (this is accomplished by showing that each of the open subsets D(f) is in fact an affine scheme). =The sheaf associated to a graded module= The essential property of S for the above construction was the ability to form localizations S_{(p)} for each prime ideal p of S. This property is also possessed by any graded module M over S, and therefore with the appropriate minor modifications the preceding section constructs for any such M a sheaf, denoted \\\\tilde{M}, of O_X-modules on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S. This sheaf is quasicoherent by construction. If S is generated by finitely many elements of degree 1 (e.g. a polynomial ring or a homogenous quotient of it), all quasicoherent sheaves on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S arise from graded modules by this construction., Corollary 15.4.3. The corresponding graded module is not unique. =The twisting sheaf of Serre= :For related information, and the classical Serre twist sheaf, see tautological bundle A special case of the sheaf associated to a graded module is when we take M to be S itself with a different grading: namely, we let the degree d elements of M be the degree (d + 1) elements of S, and denote M = S(1). We then obtain \\\\tilde{M} as a quasicoherent sheaf on \\\\operatorname{Proj} S, denoted O_X(1) or simply O(1), called the twisting sheaf of Serre. It can be checked that O(1) is in fact an invertible sheaf. One reason for the utility of O(1) is that it recovers the algebraic information of S that was lost when, in the construction of O_X, we passed to fractions of degree zero. In the case Spec A for a ring A, the global sections of the structure sheaf form A itself, whereas the global sections of O_X here form only the degree-zero elements of S. If we define : O(n) = \\\\bigotimes_{i = 1}^n O(1) then each O(n) contains the degree-n information about S, and taken together they contain all the grading information that was lost. Likewise, for any sheaf of graded O_X-modules N we define : N(n) = N \\\\otimes O(n) and expect this ‚Äútwisted‚Äù sheaf to contain grading information about N. In particular, if N is the sheaf associated to a graded S-module M we likewise expect it to contain lost grading information about M. This suggests, though erroneously, that S can in fact be reconstructed from these sheaves; however, this is true in the case that S is a polynomial ring, below. This situation is to be contrasted with the fact that the spec functor is adjoint to the global sections functor in the category of locally ringed spaces. =Projective n-space= If A is a ring, we define projective n-space over A to be the scheme :\\\\mathbb{P}^n_A = \\\\operatorname{Proj} A[x_0,\\\\ldots, x_n]. The grading on the polynomial ring S=A[x_0,\\\\ldots, x_n] is defined by letting each x_i have degree one and every element of A, degree zero. Comparing this to the definition of O(1), above, we see that the sections of O(1) are in fact linear homogeneous polynomials, generated by the x_i themselves. This suggests another interpretation of O(1), namely as the sheaf of ‚Äúcoordinates‚Äù for \\\\operatorname{Proj} S, since the x_i are literally the coordinates for projective n-space.  Examples of Proj  * If we let the base ring be A = \\\\mathbb{C}[\\\\lambda], then \\\\operatorname{Proj}(A[X, Y, Z]/(ZY^2 - X(X - Z)(X - \\\\lambda Z))) has a canonical projective morphism to the affine line \\\\mathbb{A}^1_\\\\lambda whose fibers are elliptic curves, except at the points \\\\lambda = 0,1 where the curves degenerate into nodal curves. * The projective hypersurface \\\\operatorname{Proj}\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{C}[X_0,\\\\ldots,X_4]/(X_0^5 + \\\\cdots + X_4^5) \\\\right) is an example of a Fermat quintic threefold which is also a Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold. * Weighted projective spaces can be constructed using a polynomial ring whose variables have non-standard degrees. For example, the weighted projective space \\\\mathbb{P}(1,1,2) corresponds to taking \\\\operatorname{Proj} of the ring A[X_0,X_1,X_2] where X_0, X_1 have weight 1 while X_2 has weight 2. * Having a bigraded ring corresponds to taking a subscheme of a product of projective spaces. For example, the bigraded algebra \\\\mathbb{C}[X_0,X_1,Y_0,Y_1], where the X_i have weight (1,0) and the Y_i have weight (0,1), corresponds to the ring of \\\\mathbb{P}^1_X \\\\times \\\\mathbb{P}^1_Y. Global Proj A generalization of the Proj construction replaces the ring S with a sheaf of algebras and produces, as the end result, a scheme which might be thought of as a fibration of Proj's of rings. This construction is often used, for example, to construct projective space bundles over a base scheme. =Assumptions= Formally, let X be any scheme and S be a sheaf of graded O_X-algebras (the definition of which is similar to the definition of O_X- modules on a locally ringed space): that is, a sheaf with a direct sum decomposition : S = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\geq 0} S_i where each S_i is an O_X-module such that for every open subset U of X, S(U) is an O_X(U)-algebra and the resulting direct sum decomposition : S(U) = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\geq 0} S_i(U) is a grading of this algebra as a ring. Here we assume that S_0 = O_X. We make the additional assumption that S is a quasi-coherent sheaf; this is a ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù assumption on the sections over different open sets that is necessary for the construction to proceed. =Construction= In this setup we may construct a scheme \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S and a ‚Äúprojection‚Äù map p onto X such that for every open affine U of X, : (\\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S)_{p^{-1}(U)} = \\\\operatorname{Proj} (S(U)). This definition suggests that we construct \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S by first defining schemes Y_U for each open affine U, by setting : Y_U = \\\\operatorname{Proj} S(U), and maps p_U \\\\colon Y_U \\\\to U, and then showing that these data can be glued together ‚Äúover‚Äù each intersection of two open affines U and V to form a scheme Y which we define to be \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S. It is not hard to show that defining each p_U to be the map corresponding to the inclusion of O_X(U) into S(U) as the elements of degree zero yields the necessary consistency of the p_U, while the consistency of the Y_U themselves follows from the quasi- coherence assumption on S. =The twisting sheaf= If S has the additional property that S_1 is a coherent sheaf and locally generates S over S_0 (that is, when we pass to the stalk of the sheaf S at a point x of X, which is a graded algebra whose degree-zero elements form the ring O_{X,x} then the degree-one elements form a finitely-generated module over O_{X,x} and also generate the stalk as an algebra over it) then we may make a further construction. Over each open affine U, Proj S(U) bears an invertible sheaf O(1), and the assumption we have just made ensures that these sheaves may be glued just like the Y_U above; the resulting sheaf on \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S is also denoted O(1) and serves much the same purpose for \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{Proj}} S as the twisting sheaf on the Proj of a ring does. = Proj of a quasi-coherent sheaf = Let \\\\mathcal E be a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme X. The sheaf of symmetric algebras \\\\mathbf{Sym}_{O_X}(\\\\mathcal E) is naturally a quasi-coherent sheaf of graded O_X-modules, generated by elements of degree 1. The resulting scheme is denoted by \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E). If \\\\mathcal E is of finite type, then its canonical morphism p : \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E)\\\\to X is a projective morphism.EGA, II.5.5. For any x\\\\in X, the fiber of the above morphism over x is the projective space \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E(x)) associated to the dual of the vector space \\\\mathcal E(x):=\\\\mathcal E\\\\otimes_{O_X} k(x) over k(x). If \\\\mathcal S is a quasi-coherent sheaf of graded O_X-modules, generated by \\\\mathcal S_1 and such that \\\\mathcal S_1 is of finite type, then \\\\mathbf{Proj}\\\\mathcal S is a closed subscheme of \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal S_1) and is then projective over X. In fact, every closed subscheme of a projective \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E) is of this form.EGA, II.5.5.1. =Projective space bundles= As a special case, when \\\\mathcal E is locally free of rank n+1, we get a projective bundle \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E) over X of relative dimension n. Indeed, if we take an open cover of X by open affines U=\\\\operatorname{Spec}(A) such that when restricted to each of these, \\\\mathcal E is free over A, then : \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E)_{p^{-1}(U)} \\\\simeq \\\\operatorname{Proj} A[x_0, \\\\dots, x_n] = \\\\mathbb{P}^n_A = \\\\mathbb{P}^n_U, and hence \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathcal E) is a projective space bundle.  Example of Global Proj  Global proj can be used to construct Lefschetz pencils. For example, let X = \\\\mathbb{P}^1_{s,t} and take homogeneous polynomials f,g \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] of degree k. We can consider the ideal sheaf \\\\mathcal{I} = (sf + tg) of \\\\mathcal{O}_X[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] and construct global proj of this quotient sheaf of algebras \\\\mathcal{O}_X[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]/\\\\mathcal{I}. This can be described explicitly as the projective morphism \\\\operatorname{Proj}(\\\\mathbb{C}[s,t][x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]/(sf + tg)) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1_{s,t}.

This field holds the promise of engineering damaged tissues and organs by stimulating the body's own repair mechanisms to functionally heal previously irreparable tissues or organs. Regenerative medicine also includes the possibility of growing tissues and organs in the laboratory and implanting them when the body cannot heal itself. When the cell source for a regenerated organ is derived from the patient's own tissue or cells, the challenge of organ transplant rejection via immunological mismatch is circumvented. This approach could alleviate the problem of the shortage of organs available for donation. Some of the biomedical approaches within the field of regenerative medicine may involve the use of stem cells. Examples include the injection of stem cells or progenitor cells obtained through directed differentiation (cell therapies); the induction of regeneration by biologically active molecules administered alone or as a secretion by infused cells (immunomodulation therapy); and transplantation of in vitro grown organs and tissues (tissue engineering).  History  The ancient Greeks postulated whether parts of the body could be regenerated in the 700s BC. Skin grafting, invented in the late 19th century, can be thought of as the earliest major attempt to recreate bodily tissue to restore structure and function. Advances in transplanting body parts in the 20th century further pushed the theory that body parts could regenerate and grow new cells. These advances led to tissue engineering, and from this field, the study of regenerative medicine expanded and began to take hold. This began with cellular therapy, which led to the stem cell research that is widely being conducted today. The first cell therapies were intended to slow the aging process. This began in the 1930s with Paul Niehans, a Swiss doctor who was known to have treated famous historical figures such as Pope Pius XII, Charlie Chaplin, and king Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Niehans would inject cells of young animals (usually lambs or calves) into his patients in an attempt to rejuvenate them. In the year 1956, a more sophisticated process was created to treat leukemia by inserting bone marrow from a healthy person into a patient with leukemia. This process worked mostly due to both the donor and receiver in this case being identical twins. Nowadays, bone marrow can be taken from people who are similar enough to the patient who needs the cells to prevent rejection. The term \\"regenerative medicine\\" was first used in a 1992 article on hospital administration by Leland Kaiser. Kaiser's paper closes with a series of short paragraphs on future technologies that will impact hospitals. One paragraph had \\"Regenerative Medicine\\" as a bold print title and stated, \\"A new branch of medicine will develop that attempts to change the course of chronic disease and in many instances will regenerate tired and failing organ systems.\\" The term was brought into the popular culture in 1999 by William A. Haseltine when he coined the term during a conference on Lake Como, to describe interventions that restore to normal function that which is damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time.https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf0450/ Viola, J., Lal, B., and Grad, O. The Emergence of Tissue Engineering as a Research Field. Arlington, VA: National Science Foundation, 2003. Haseltine was briefed on the project to isolate human embryonic stem cells and embryonic germ cells at Geron Corporation in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He recognized that these cells' unique ability to differentiate into all the cell types of the human body (pluripotency) had the potential to develop into a new kind of regenerative therapy. Explaining the new class of therapies that such cells could enable, he used the term \\"regenerative medicine\\" in the way that it is used today: \\"an approach to therapy that ... employs human genes, proteins and cells to re-grow, restore or provide mechanical replacements for tissues that have been injured by trauma, damaged by disease or worn by time\\" and \\"offers the prospect of curing diseases that cannot be treated effectively today, including those related to aging\\". Later, Haseltine would go on to explain that regenerative medicine acknowledges the reality that most people, regardless of which illness they have or which treatment they require, simply want to be restored to normal health. Designed to be applied broadly, the original definition includes cell and stem cell therapies, gene therapy, tissue engineering, genomic medicine, personalized medicine, biomechanical prosthetics, recombinant proteins, and antibody treatments. It also includes more familiar chemical pharmacopeia‚Äîin short, any intervention that restores a person to normal health. In addition to functioning as shorthand for a wide range of technologies and treatments, the term ‚Äúregenerative medicine‚Äù is also patient friendly. It solves the problem of confusing or intimidating language discourage to patients. The term regenerative medicine is increasingly conflated with research on stem cell therapies. Some academic programs and departments retain the original broader definition while others use it to describe work on stem cell research. From 1995 to 1998 Michael D. West, PhD, organized and managed the research between Geron Corporation and its academic collaborators James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University that led to the first isolation of human embryonic stem and human embryonic germ cells, respectively. In March 2000, Haseltine, Antony Atala, M.D., Michael D. West, Ph.D., and other leading researchers founded E-Biomed: The Journal of Regenerative Medicine. The peer- reviewed journal facilitated discourse around regenerative medicine by publishing innovative research on stem cell therapies, gene therapies, tissue engineering, and biomechanical prosthetics. The Society for Regenerative Medicine, later renamed the Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology Society, served a similar purpose, creating a community of like-minded experts from around the world. In June 2008, at the Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team, of the University of Barcelona, performed the first tissue engineered trachea (wind pipe) transplantation. Adult stem cells were extracted from the patient's bone marrow, grown into a large population, and matured into cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, using an adaptive method originally devised for treating osteoarthritis. The team then seeded the newly grown chondrocytes, as well as epithelial cells, into a decellularised (free of donor cells) tracheal segment that was donated from a 51-year-old transplant donor who had died of cerebral hemorrhage. After four days of seeding, the graft was used to replace the patient's left main bronchus. After one month, a biopsy elicited local bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back successfully. In 2009, the SENS Foundation was launched, with its stated aim as \\"the application of regenerative medicine ‚Äì defined to include the repair of living cells and extracellular material in situ ‚Äì to the diseases and disabilities of ageing\\". In 2012, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team improved upon the 2008 implant by transplanting a laboratory-made trachea seeded with the patient's own cells. On September 12, 2014, surgeons at the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation Hospital in Kobe, Japan, transplanted a 1.3 by 3.0 millimeter sheet of retinal pigment epithelium cells, which were differentiated from iPS cells through Directed differentiation, into an eye of an elderly woman, who suffers from age-related macular degeneration. In 2016, Paolo Macchiarini was fired from Karolinska University in Sweden due to falsified test results and lies. The TV-show Experimenten aired on Swedish Television and detailed all the lies and falsified results.  Research  Widespread interest and funding for research on regenerative medicine has prompted institutions in the United States and around the world to establish departments and research institutes that specialize in regenerative medicine including: The Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine at Columbia University, the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University, the Center for Regenerative and Nanomedicine at Northwestern University, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the British Heart Foundation Centers of Regenerative Medicine at the University of Oxford. In China, institutes dedicated to regenerative medicine are run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, among others. = In Dentistry = A diagram of a human tooth. Stem cells are located in the pulp in the center. Regenerative medicine has been studied by dentists to find ways that damaged teeth can be repaired and restored to obtain natural structure and function. Dental tissues are often damaged due to tooth decay, and are often deemed to be irreplaceable except by synthetic or metal dental fillings or crowns, which requires further damage to be done to the teeth by drilling into them to prevent the loss of an entire tooth. Researchers from King‚Äôs College London have created a drug called Tideglusib that claims to have the ability to regrow dentin, the second layer of the tooth beneath the enamel which encases and protects the pulp (often referred to as the nerve). Animal studies conducted on mice in Japan in 2007 show great possibilities in regenerating an entire tooth. Some mice had a tooth extracted and the cells from bioengineered tooth germs were implanted into them and allowed to grow. The result were perfectly functioning and healthy teeth, complete with all three layers, as well as roots. These teeth also had the necessary ligaments to stay rooted in its socket and allow for natural shifting. They contrast with traditional dental implants, which are restricted to one spot as they are drilled into the jawbone. A person‚Äôs baby teeth are known to contain stem cells that can be used for regeneration of the dental pulp after a root canal treatment or injury. These cells can also be used to repair damage from periodontitis, an advanced form of gum disease that causes bone loss and severe gum recession. Research is still being done to see if these stem cells are viable enough to grow into completely new teeth. Some parents even opt to keep their childrens' baby teeth in special storage with the thought that, when older, the children could use the stem cells within them to treat a condition. =Extracellular matrix= Extracellular matrix materials are commercially available and are used in reconstructive surgery, treatment of chronic wounds, and some orthopedic surgeries; as of January 2017 clinical studies were under way to use them in heart surgery to try to repair damaged heart tissue. = Cord blood = Though uses of cord blood beyond blood and immunological disorders is speculative, some research has been done in other areas. Any such potential beyond blood and immunological uses is limited by the fact that cord cells are hematopoietic stem cells (which can differentiate only into blood cells), and not pluripotent stem cells (such as embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate into any type of tissue). Cord blood has been studied as a treatment for diabetes. However, apart from blood disorders, the use of cord blood for other diseases is not a routine clinical modality and remains a major challenge for the stem cell community. Along with cord blood, Wharton's jelly and the cord lining have been explored as sources for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and as of 2015 had been studied in vitro, in animal models, and in early stage clinical trials for cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurological deficits, liver diseases, immune system diseases, diabetes, lung injury, kidney injury, and leukemia.

The range of what is often described as a hotliner varies from a sailplane with ailerons to 7000 watt competition F5b planes. General characteristics of a hotliner are: * Sailplane with at least aileron and elevator control * Electric motor * Ability to climb at an angle of 70 degrees or more, usually vertical climbs. Hotliners have been around since the early 1990s and became popular almost a decade later.  History  The first hotliner was Hans-Dieter Levin's Aeronaut Sinus, described in a German magazine. Originally, hotliners were electric sailplanes with remotely controlled ailerons, capable of flying faster than the models of the period that only had rudder and elevator controls. Levin tested his Sinus with a Speed 600 motor and an 8x4.5?(diameter(inches)/pitch(incher per revolution)) prop and a 7 cell NiCad battery pack. In this configuration a climb at more than 70¬∞ was not possible. However, the term, hotliner, has since evolved to mean models with a fast climb rate. Aileron-equipped electric models which are not so fast are called warmliners. Typically hotliners are launched at full throttle and reach a high altitude.

Cancer specific T-cells can be obtained by fragmentation and isolation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or by genetically engineering cells from peripheral blood. The cells are activated and grown prior to transfusion into the recipient (tumour bearer) Cell therapy (also called cellular therapy, cell transplantation, or cytotherapy) is a therapy in which viable cells are injected, grafted or implanted into a patient in order to effectuate a medicinal effect, for example, by transplanting T-cells capable of fighting cancer cells via cell-mediated immunity in the course of immunotherapy, or grafting stem cells to regenerate diseased tissues. Cell therapy originated in the nineteenth century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness. Although such attempts produced no positive benefit, further research found in the mid twentieth century that human cells could be used to help prevent the human body rejecting transplanted organs, leading in time to successful bone marrow transplantation as has become common practice in treatment for patients that have compromised bone marrow after disease, infection, radiation or chemotherapy. In recent decades, however, stem cell and cell transplantation has gained significant interest by researchers as a potential new therapeutic strategy for a wide range of diseases, in particular for degenerative and immunogenic pathologies. Background Charles-√âdouard Brown-S√©quard - tried to stop aging by injecting animal testicle extract Cell therapy can be defined as therapy in which cellular material is injected or otherwise transplanted into a patient. The origins of cell therapy can perhaps be traced to the nineteenth century, when Charles-√âdouard Brown-S√©quard (1817‚Äì1894) injected animal testicle extracts in an attempt to stop the effects of aging. In 1931 Paul Niehans (1882‚Äì1971) - who has been called the inventor of cell therapy - attempted to cure a patient by injecting material from calf embryos. Niehans claimed to have treated many people for cancer using this technique, though his claims have never been validated by research. In 1953 researchers found that laboratory animals could be helped not to reject organ transplants by pre-inoculating them with cells from donor animals; in 1968, in Minnesota, the first successful human bone marrow transplantation took place. In more recent work, cell encapsulation is pursued as a means to shield therapeutic cells from the host immune response. Recent work includes micro-encapsulating cells in a gel core surrounded by a solid, but permeable, shell. Bone marrow transplants are the most common and well established cell transplantation therapies. The first recording of a successful bone marrow transplant, dates back to 1956 by dr. E Donnall Thomas, who treated a leukemia patient with their twin-siblings bone marrow. In general, for patients presenting damaged or destroyed bone marrow, for example after chemotherapy and/or radiation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), bone marrow derived cells can be infused into the patients blood stream. Here the injected cells are able to home into the afflicted bone marrow, integrate, proliferate and recover or re-establish its biological function e.g. the haematopoiesis. Annually an estimated 18,000 patients require potentially life-saving bone marrow transplants in the USA. For a long time, bone marrow transplantation was the only clinically applicable method of cell transplantation, however, since the 1990s, cell therapy has been investigated for a wide scale of pathologies and disorders. Cell therapy provided a novel approach to effectuate therapeutic efficacy. Previously, medical agents could only be effective by directing and inducing the patients own cells. However, in many diseases and disorders, cell are compromised by e.g. senescence, limited blood supply (ischemia), inflammation, or simply a reduction in the number of cells. Cell therapy offers a new strategy that supports the introduction of new and active cells to restore previously compromised or deteriorated tissue- and organ structures. As such, in recent times, cell therapy has been recognized as an important field in the treatment of human disease, and investigations are ongoing in articular cartilage, brain tissue, spine, heart, cancers, etc. As a consequence cell therapy as a strategy has been attracting significant investments by commercial entities which suggest strong prospects for future growth.  Mechanisms of action  Cell therapy is targeted at many clinical indications in multiple organs and by several modes of cell delivery. Accordingly, the specific mechanisms of action involved in the therapies are wide-ranging. However, there are two main principles by which cells facilitate therapeutic action: #Stem, progenitor, or mature cell engraftment, differentiation, and long term replacement of damaged tissue. In this paradigm multipotent or unipotent cells differentiate into a specific cell type in the lab or after reaching the site of injury (via local or systemic administration). These cells then integrate into the site of injury, replacing damaged tissue, and thus facilitate improved function of the organ or tissue. An example of this is the use of cells to replace cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, to facilitate angiogenesis in ischemic limb disease, or the production of cartilage matrix in intervertebral disc degeneration. #Cells that have the capacity to release soluble factors such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which act in a paracrine or endocrine manner. These factors facilitate self-healing of the organ or region by inducing local (stem) cells or attracting cells to migrate towards the transplantation site. The delivered cells (via local or systemic administration) remain viable for a relatively short period (days-weeks) and then die. This includes cells that naturally secrete the relevant therapeutic factors, or which undergo epigenetic changes or genetic engineering that causes the cells to release large quantities of a specific molecule. Examples of this include cells that secrete factors which facilitate angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis.Deuse, T., C. Peter, et al. (2009). \\"Hepatocyte growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor gene transfer maximizes mesenchymal stem cell-based myocardial salvage after acute myocardial infarction.\\" Circulation 120(11 Suppl): S247-54. This mode of action is proposed by companies such as Pluristem and Pervasis that use adherent stromal cells or mature endothelial cells to treat peripheral artery disease and arteriovenous access complications.  Cell therapy strategies =Allogeneic Cell Therapy= In allogeneic cell therapy the donor is a different person to the recipient of the cells. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the allogenic methodology is promising because unmatched allogenic therapies can form the basis of \\"off the shelf\\" products. There is research interest in attempting to develop such products to treat conditions including Crohn's disease and a variety of vascular conditions. =Autologous Cell Therapy= In autologous cell therapy, cells are transplanted that are derived from the patients own tissues. Multiple clinical studies are ongoing that obtain stromal cells from bone-marrow, adipose tissue, or peripheral blood to be transplanted at sites of injury or stress; which is being actively explored for e.g. cartilage and muscle repair. It could also involve the isolation of matured cells from diseased tissues, to be later re-implanted at the same or neighboring tissues; a strategy being assessed in clinical trials for e.g. the spine in preventing disc reherniation or adjacent disc disease. The benefit of an autologous strategy is that there is limited concern for immunogenic responses or transplant rejection. Nevertheless, an autologous strategy is often costly due to patient-by-patient processing, thus preventing the option to create large quality-controlled batches. Moreover, autologous strategies generally do not allow for product quality and effectiveness testing prior to transplantation, as it is highly donor (thus patient) dependent. This is a particular concern as often the patient functioning as donor is diseased, and this can impact cell potency and quality. =Xenogeneic Cell Therapy= In xenogeneic cell therapies, the recipient will receive cells from another species. For example, the transplantation of pig derived cells to humans. Currently, xenogeneic cell therapies primarily involve human cell transplantation into experimental animal models for assessment of efficacy and safety, however future advances could potentially enable xenogeneic strategies to humans as well.  Types of cells =Human embryonic stem cells= Research into human embryonic stem cells is controversial, and regulation varies from country to country, with some countries banning it outright. Nevertheless, these cells are being investigated as the basis for a number of therapeutic applications, including possible treatments for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. =Neural Stem Cell Therapy= Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the subject of ongoing research for possible therapeutic applications, for example for treating a number of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. =Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy= MSCs are immunomodulatory, multipotent and fast proliferating and these unique capabilities mean they can be used for a wide range of treatments including immune-modulatory therapy, bone and cartilage regeneration, myocardium regeneration and the treatment of Hurler syndrome, a skeletal and neurological disorder.Oh SKW and Choo ABH (2011) The Biological Basis  Stem Cells. In: Murray Moo-Young (ed.), Comprehensive Biotechnology, Second Edition, Volume 1, pp. 341‚Äì365. Elsevier. Researchers have demonstrated the use of MSCs for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Horwitz et al. transplanted bone marrow (BM) cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings to patients suffering from OI. Results show that MSCs can develop into normal osteoblasts, leading to fast bone development and reduced fracture frequencies. A more recent clinical trial showed that allogeneic fetal MSCs transplanted in utero in patients with severe OI can engraft and differentiate into bone in a human fetus. Besides bone and cartilage regeneration, cardiomyocyte regeneration with autologous BM MSCs has also been reported recently. Introduction of BM MSCs following myocardial infarction (MI) resulted in significant reduction of damaged regions and improvement in heart function. Clinical trials for treatment of acute MI with Prochymal by Osiris Therapeutics are underway. Also, a clinical trial revealed huge improvements in nerve conduction velocities in Hurler's Syndrome patients infused with BM MSCs from HLA-identical siblings. =Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation= Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), derived from bone marrow or blood, are cells with the abilities to self-renew and to differentiate into all types of blood cells, especially those involved in the human immune system. Thus, they can be used to treat blood and immune disorders. Since human bone marrow grafting was first published in 1957, there have been significant advancements in HSCs therapy. Following that, syngeneic marrow infusion and allogeneic marrow grafting were performed successfully. HSCs therapy can also render its cure by reconstituting damaged blood-forming cells and restoring the immune system after high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate disease. There are three types of HSC transplantation: syngeneic, autologous, and allogeneic transplants. Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins. Autologous transplantations use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence avoid complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic transplantations involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant). In addition to bone marrow-derived HSCs, the use of alternative sources such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) has been increasing. In comparison with bone marrow-derived HSC recipients, PBSC recipients afflicted with myeloid malignancies reported a faster engraftment and better overall survival. The use of UCB requires less stringent HLA loci matching, although the time of engraftment is longer and graft failure rate is higher. =Differentiated or Mature cell transplantation= Alternative to stem- or progenitor cells, investigations are exploring the transplantation of differentiated cells that only possess low or no proliferation ability. This tends to involve specialized cells able to facilitate specific function in the patients body (for example, transplantation of cardiomyocytes to repair heart function or islet cell transplantation for establishing insulin homeostasis in diabetes patients) or support/regenerate the extracellular matrix production of specific tissues (for example intervertebral disc repair by transplanting chondrocytes). Alternative medicine In alternative medicine, cell therapy is defined as the injection of non-human cellular animal material in an attempt to treat illness. Quackwatch labels this as \\"senseless\\", since \\"cells from the organs of one species cannot replace the cells from the organs of other species\\" and because a number of serious adverse effects have been reported. Of this alternative, animal-based form of cell therapy, the American Cancer Society say: \\"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. It may in fact be lethal ...\\". Manufacturing Despite being one of the fast growing areas within Life Sciences, the manufacturing of cell therapy products is largely hindered by small scale batches and labour-intensive processes.

It was once the site of an amusement park. The main intersection is dominated by Saint Thomas Moore Roman Catholic Church and the Howe Convenient Market. Located in northeastern Pennsylvania, Lake Ariel was founded by settlers with the name of Jones, and thus was once known by its people as Jonestown. Although when the town began it was formed of only a few family farms, Jonestown soon expanded due to the Pennsylvania Coal Company's Gravity Railroad. It brought workers and soon businesses were needed to fulfil their needs, including a post office named Ariel, which would later lead to the change in name of the town. Image:Theviewoflakeariel2.JPG Image:TheViewofLakeAriel3.JPG History First settled in 1822 by the Jones family, the town was first called The Stock Farm and later Jonestown or Jones Pond. The first farm was located at the south end of the lake. = Lake Ariel Park = Lake Ariel Park was a major destination for many in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Lake Ariel Park, Since the late 19th century through the 20th century, Lake Ariel has had various thriving businesses. There were numerous sawmills, and Lake Ariel also had different factories such as a cheese factory and a chair factory. Many locals also held jobs at the ice houses and Lake Ariel Park. Lake Ariel Park was a major tourist area for the community. It contained a pavilion for picnics and dancing. There were also rides such as a waterslide, a rollercoaster called the Cyclone, carousels, and miniature train rides. The park also had a beach where visitors could go swimming or boating. The owners of Lake Ariel Park also purchased an airplane so that their visitors could pay to get rides in the plane. The Lake Ariel Park also led to the increased popularity of the Lake Ariel Hotel which was formerly known as the Columbia Hotel. The Lake Ariel Hotel stood in disrepair for many years until it was finally torn down in 2011. Unfortunately, the Lake Ariel Park had a worse fate. Due to summer hurricanes and bad winters the park had to be closed down in the early 1950s. Some businesses did withstand the test of time. John T. Howe started his gas station in 1919, the business was passed down to his son and is still in business today. It now is called Howe Convenient Market. It is a gas station and store but it is not in the original building. Another business that had a few changes but is still running today is the Wayne Garage. It was built in 1915, making it the oldest business in Lake Ariel. After it was sold to new owners in 1958 it was changed to a body shop and remains one today. Image:LakeArielPAHOTEL.JPGThe Lake Ariel Hotel in recent years. It was torn down in 2011. The original St. Thomas More was dedicated in 1942. In 1996 the construction for the expansion of the church began; the rectory was torn down and rebuilt across the street, the church was converted into a steeple and offices and a new, larger church was built connected to it. A church from the past that remains unchanged today is the Avoy Christian Church, not only is it still standing but it still has services on Sunday. The Gravity Pentecostal Church is also still intact today, but it is now used as a house. Image:StThomasMooreSteeple.JPGThe original St. Thomas Moore Church in Lake Ariel PA. You can see the new church in the background. The Lake Ariel Elementary school has gone through many changes in its time. The original building is no longer the educational institute. The building known today as the Lake Ariel Elementary School was formerly known as the Lake Consolidated School. It was built in 1936 and in the 1950s in held the grades kindergarten through 12th. Since a new high school was built in Varden in 1973 it has been used solely as an elementary school. The Lake Ariel Elementary School closed down in 2011, after a new elementary school was built in a nearby town. The building was demolished in mid to late 2016 Present day The center of Lake Ariel is the setting of most of the community's businesses, although there are numerous others. Image:HowesGasStation.JPGHowe Convenient Market Lake Ariel also contains many churches and religious institutions. St. Thomas More's Catholic Church is located in the center of the community, while several Protestant churches are located at various places in the community.

It is the second of a two-album suite detailing the mourning of a lover who has recently passed. Like Face One, Face Two was also released in multiple formats, including a double vinyl edition and an A5-sized boxed set edition; both were limited pressings, of 500 and 3,000 copies, respectively. Overview Dead Lovers' Sarabande, as a whole, is a transitory death suite detailing the unnamed protagonist's mourning of her lover and her desire to rejoin him in the afterlife. Major recurring themes in the work include euthanasia, necrophilia, decay and loneliness. In (Face Two), the protagonist seems to have accepted the fact that her lover is dead and they will no longer share the same life they have led. She decides to continue loving him as she always have, despite his memory haunting her. She concludes by admitting that \\"it's easier to love the dead\\" and that she would truly be alone if Love was considered everything in life, rather than Death or Loneliness. Anna-Varney Cantodea later admitted that \\"Dead Lovers' Sarabande\\" was dedicated to, but not about, the late Rozz Williams, former frontman of deathrock band Christian Death. The album retains the focus on folk music and chamber pieces presented by (Face One), but transplants many of the string instruments for brass arrangements. Electric guitar is featured on \\"If Loneliness was all\\", for the first time since \\"Todeswunsch - Sous le soleil de Saturne\\". The influence of drone music is still present on songs like \\"Procession/Funeral March\\". \\"Va(r)nitas, vanitas...\\" contains elements of \\"Feralia Genetalia\\" from \\"Voyager\\" - The Jugglers of Jusa. As a subtle joke, Cantodea referenced her own name in the song title, effectively translating it as \\"Varney, vanity... (...all is vanity).\\" \\"Dead Lovers' Sarabande\\" (Face Two) was re-released on CD with newly packaged artwork in 2004.

Upper Burma in orange; British Burma (Lower Burma) and other British possessions in pink Upper Burma (, also called Upper Myanmar) refers to a geographic region of Burma (Myanmar), traditionally encompassing Mandalay and its periphery (modern Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway Regions), or more broadly speaking, Kachin and Shan States. In the Burmese language, people originating from Upper Burma are typically called a-nya tha (), whereas those from Lower Burma are called auk tha (). The term was first used by the British to refer to the central and northern area of what is now modern day Burma (Myanmar). After the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, Lower Burma was annexed by the British Empire, while Upper Burma remained independent under the Burmese Empire until the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. Upper Burma was also known as Burma proper and the Kingdom of Ava. Historically, Upper Burma was predominantly Bamar (whereas Lower Burma was historically Mon-speaking until the early 19th century), while the Frontier Areas, as designated by the colonial administration, included ethnic minority areas, such as the Shan States and modern Kachin State. This distinction between Upper and Lower Burma is also found in some government departments (for instance, the Ministry of Education has departments assigned to Upper or Lower Burma), while some newspapers make a distinction between the two bodies. The Burmese language edition of The Myanmar Times is an example; the newspaper devotes a section to news from Upper Burma. In terms of linguistic differences, there are minute differences between the variants of Burmese spoken by Upper Burmese, especially in vocabulary choice (such as kinship terms that differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family, which is not made in Lower Burmese speech). However, there is remarkable uniformity in the Burmese spoken throughout the Irrawaddy River valley, which also includes the delta-lying and coastal region of Lower Burma.

Variations represent popular national dishes in Puerto Rico, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It usually consists of large pieces of meat, tubers and vegetables served in a broth. Variations Sancocho de guand√∫ con carne sal√° (Sancocho with pigeon peas and salted meat. Sancocho de espinazo de cerdo (Pork spine sancocho) from Colombia. In Puerto Rico, sancocho is considered a fairly rustic dish. It is made with chicken and smoked ham (Sancocho de gallina), top round beef (sancocho), pork feet with chickpeas (sancocho de patitas), or beef short ribs with chorizo. There are several versions and every household has their own take on sancocho, but a true Puerto Rican sancocho always calls for corn on the cob, a variety of tubers, guineos, sofrito, and saz√≥n. Other vegetables and flavoring can include celery, carrots, ginger, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, or√©gano, wine, and rum. The hearty stew is served with a small bowl of rice, pique criollo, tostones, and bread. In Venezuela, sancochos are prepared throughout the country, recognized as a typical meal of the weekend. The stew can be beef (usually in the Llanos region), chicken (usually central and western region), beef stomach and shank (simply called \\"tripe\\") or goat (here called \\"goat tripe\\", typical of western Falc√≥n and Lara states) and fish or seafood (usually East and Caribbean coast). When mixing two types of meat (chicken and beef, etc.) is called crossover or \\"cruzado\\". Among vegetables and traditional spices for all varieties are yam, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, potato, cassava, jojoto (maize/corn), celery (celeriac), taro (mafafa/malanga), pumpkin (squash), cabbage, Chinese taro or Chirel hot pepper, cilantro, and green or topocho banana. These soups are major Venezuelan cuisine dishes that are not usually accompanied by other foods. Consumed at lunchtime or in the evening, the stew is a common dish at celebrations, usually served during or after meals ‚Äî the latter, according to popular belief, to relieve hangover. For this reason, it is typical to serve this dish for lunch on Christmas or New Year's Day. It is usually served with cassava or with arepas. Some people add lemon juice (especially fish). There are variants of the same, as the \\"cruzado\\" and the three-phase, when three types of meat are combined. Undeniably, the popularity of this dish is seen at celebrations: Instead of saying you are going to a party, it is common to \\"go to a sancocho.\\" Colloquially, it is often simply called \\"soup\\". In some regions (as in Zulia state) it is given the name sop√≥n. Sancocho is a traditional food in Colombia made with many kinds of meat (most commonly chicken, hen, pork ribs, cow ribs, fish, and ox tail) with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables such as tomato, scallion, cilantro, and mazorca (corn on the cob), depending on the region. Some top it off with fresh cilantro, onion and squeezed lime ‚Äî a sort of \\"pico de gallo\\", minus the tomato. It is also served with a side of sliced avocado and a plate of white rice, which is usually dipped in with each spoonful of soup. In the \\"Sierra\\" of Ecuador, sancocho, also known as fritada, is a comfort food made with pork. In the coastal region, it is similar to the Colombian sancocho. It has the typical ingredients: yuca, plantain, and corn \\"choclo\\". It can be made of fish, hen, chicken, oxtail, or beef. Due to cultural differences, it can cause confusion when people go from one region to the other. The Peruvian sancocho is called \\"sancochado\\" a baseline: meat chunks, corn, rice, and potatoes. In the Dominican Republic, \\"sancocho\\" is considered one of the national dishes, along with \\"la bandera\\" (the flag), consisting of white rice, generally red beans and meat, usually chicken. There is a variant called sancocho cruzado or sancocho de siete carnes, which includes chicken, beef and pork, with other meats. Sancocho de siete carnes means \\"seven meat sancocho\\" and is considered the ultimate sancocho dish. Longaniza, a type of pork sausage, is also used. Sancocho de gallina (hen sancocho) is common as well, often made for special occasions or on weekends. While sancocho de habichuela (bean sancocho) and sancocho de guandules are common, other types of sancocho are very rare. There is a similar dish in Costa Rica: It is called olla de carne (meat pot). Also known as sancocho de gallina, it is the national dish of Panama. The basic ingredients are chicken, √±ame (adding flavor and acting as a thickener, giving it its characteristic texture and brightness), and culantro (giving it most of its characteristic flavor and greenish tone); often yuca, mazorca (corn on the cob) and otoe are added. Other optional ingredients include √±amp√≠ (as the Eddoe variety of Taro is known), chopped onions, garlic and oregano. It is frequently served with white rice on the side, meant to be either mixed in or eaten with each spoonful. Hot sauce is frequently added, depending on regional and individual preferences. Regional varieties include Sancocho chorrerano (a specialty of the town of La Chorrera, which is only made with free-range chicken, onions, garlic, chili peppers, oregano and √±ameUn abanico de sabores paname√±os ) and Sancocho chiricano (a specialty from Chiriqu√≠ Province and the heartiest variety, containing squash in addition to all basic and optional ingredients mentioned before, having a yellowish color as a result). It is often recommended as the best remedy for a hangover. It is used as a metaphor for the country's racial diversity due to the varied ingredients that contribute their particular properties to and having an equally important role in the cooking process and final product. In El Salvador, it is a stew made with the offal of cattle, such as the stomach. Reflecting its Spanish influence, sancocho is eaten in the Philippines, where the hearty stew is made with fish, beef shanks, three kinds of meat, chicken, pork butt, bacon, chorizo de bilbao and morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) as well as yucca, potatoes, cilantro, corn, cabbage, bok choy, carrots and string beans. Known as cocido in the Philippines, it is often confused with puchero Filipino, which may use ham and different sausages.

Haynes is best known for his work as longtime guitarist with the Allman Brothers Band and as founding member of the jam band Gov't Mule. Early in his career he was a guitarist for David Allan Coe and The Dickey Betts Band. Haynes also is known for his associations with the surviving members of the Grateful Dead, including touring with Phil Lesh and Friends and the Dead. In addition, Haynes founded and manages Evil Teen Records. Personal background and style In addition to singing and playing acoustic and electric guitar, Haynes is also a songwriter. He spent his formative years in Asheville, North Carolina, where he was born, and lived with his two older brothers and his father, Edward Haynes. He began playing guitar at age 12. His primary guitar is a Gibson Les Paul '58 Reissue Electric Guitar. His choice of a '58 is most likely because of Duane Allman's famed '58 Les Paul and the tone he achieved with that, rather than the more commonly used '59 Les Paul model, popularized by guitarists such as Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. Haynes has referred to himself as a \\"Gibson man\\", often playing Gibson Firebird and Gibson ES-335 models as well as the Les Paul models. This was acknowledged by the American guitar maker Gibson which has included a limited edition Warren Haynes signature Les Paul in its product line; built according to Haynes' specifications and modeled on his '58 Les Paul. Haynes is married to Stefani Scamardo, a DJ for Sirius radio and the long-time manager of Gov't Mule.  Influences  In a 2006 interview with Gibson.com's Backstage Pass Haynes explains his early influences: \\"When I first started - chronologically speaking - Hendrix and Clapton and Johnny Winter were the first three people I got turned on to. That was the Cream era of Clapton. Then eventually, I heard the Allman Brothers and everybody else from that era that I stole something from (laughs). Of course, I would read interviews with all these people and find out who they listened to. And they all listened to B.B. King and Freddie King and Albert King and Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and Elmore James, so I would go back and discover that stuff.\\" Professional career=Early years= Warren Haynes joined David Allan Coe's touring and recording band in 1980 when he was 20 years old. He remained with Coe's band for four years. Shortly after, Haynes got a gig with The Nighthawks, while continuing to play with local musicians and doing session guitar and vocal work. One notable achievement of this period is a song he co-wrote with Dennis Robbins and Bobby Boyd for country musician Garth Brooks, titled \\"Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House\\", which was released on the album No Fences and remained the number 1 single on Billboard's Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for twenty weeks. =Dickey Betts Band and The Allman Brothers Band= Around 1987, Haynes got a call to perform backup vocals on a studio album by Dickey Betts, along with Dennis Robbins. Betts, who had concentrated on his solo career following the break-up of The Allman Brothers Band, decided to add Haynes to his band as his guitarist after the session. With Matt Abts on drums and Johnny Neel on keyboards, the now formed Dickey Betts Band released the 1988 album Pattern Disruptive. In the same year, Haynes also co-wrote the title track for Gregg Allman's solo album Just Before the Bullets Fly. In 1989, The Allman Brothers Band decided to reunite, and Betts recruited Haynes to join the band. Also joining were Neel on keyboards and Allen Woody on bass guitar. Haynes has since played on four well-received studio albums, including the gold certified Where It All Begins (1994). It was that same year when Warren played to his biggest audience ever with the Allman Brothers at Woodstock '94. Haynes and Woody left the group in March 1997 to focus solely on their side project Gov't Mule. Shortly after Woody's untimely death on August 26, 2000, Haynes began appearing with The Allman Brothers Band again in 2000 alongside young guitar prodigy Derek Trucks. He returned to the band as a full-time member shortly thereafter. On January 8, 2014, Haynes and Trucks jointly announced their respective plans to leave the ABB by the end of 2014, following the conclusion of the band's celebration of its 45th anniversary, with the band subsequently announcing that they would disband at the same time. =Gov't Mule= Haynes playing with Gov't Mule in 2008. In 1994, Haynes formed Gov't Mule with Abts and Woody. Haynes and Woody initially split time between Gov't Mule and The Allman Brothers Band, but after The Allman Brothers' last show of their 1997 run at New York's Beacon Theatre on March 26, 1997, both left the band to focus on Gov't Mule full-time. They released three albums and became known for their powerful live performances. Some of these performances have been released as official live albums (Live at Roseland Ballroom, Live... With a Little Help from Our Friends and Mulennium; the latter two capture consecutive New Year's Eve shows). On August 26, 2000, Allen Woody died unexpectedly. Following his death, a decision was made to finish the tour acoustically as the \\"Smile at Half-Mast\\" tour. Gov't Mule released two studio albums (The Deep End, Volume 1 and The Deep End, Volume 2) and a live album/DVD (The Deepest End, Live in Concert) featuring many of Woody's favorite bass players. In 2003, Andy Hess (bass) and Danny Louis (keyboard/organ) were added as permanent members to the group. Late the following year, this lineup released their first studio effort, Deja Voodoo, which later included an EP of newly recorded material titled Mo Voodoo. After recording 2006's High & Mighty, Gov't Mule also released a dub EP titled Mighty High and a DVD titled Tale of 2 Cities that contained two full performances recorded in 2004 and 2006. The two shows on the DVD captured the first show of the Deja Voodoo Tour and the last show of the High & Mighty Tour, serving to encapsulate what was created over those two years. In 2008, Andy Hess left Gov't Mule to pursue other projects and was replaced by relative unknown, Jorgen Carlsson. By a Thread, the first studio album from Gov't Mule featuring Carlsson, was released in 2009 on Haynes' own label, Evil Teen Records. In 2010, they went back to the vault and released Mulennium, a three-disc recording of a show from New Year's Eve 1999 in Atlanta. This was the first official recording released of the original trio since the death of Allen Woody in 2000. It also featured an appearance by Little Milton, one of Haynes's guitar heroes from his youth. =The Dead= Since the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, Haynes has performed and toured with many of the surviving members of the Grateful Dead. In 1997, Haynes and Abts came onstage to jam with Bob Weir and Rob Wasserman in a small club. The performance was being filmed for Robert Mugge's film on Robert Johnson, Hellhound on My Trail. Then in 1999, Phil Lesh approached him to play lead guitar and sing for his solo group Phil Lesh and Friends. He played regularly with Lesh for 3 years and has continued making occasional appearances in the ever evolving lineup of his \\"friends\\" in subsequent years. In 2004, when The Dead (remaining members of the Grateful Dead) were in need of a new guitarist, they called upon Haynes to come play lead and sing for that summer's \\"Wave That Flag Tour\\". His run with The Dead ended on a night where he came in with them, then performed a solo acoustic set, and then ended the night playing with The Allman Brothers Band and started out on his next tour with them. He played lead guitar for The Dead again in late 2008 when they performed at a benefit at Penn State for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, later touring with them in the spring of 2009. =Solo artist and guest appearances= Haynes playing an acoustic set with Gov't Mule, early in the band's career, at a record store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 1993, Haynes released his first solo album, Tales of Ordinary Madness, which was produced by former Allman Brother keyboardist Chuck Leavell. He toured briefly in support of the record with various musicians, including Danny Louis. In 2003 and 2004, Haynes released two solo acoustic albums, The Lone EP, a collection of live performances and Live From Bonnaroo which documents his solo performance (part acoustic, part electric) at the 2003 Bonnaroo Music Festival. When not touring with one of his electric bands, Haynes will often take time out to do solo acoustic shows, which include a variety of well-known and rare covers along with his own material. In 2004, Warren Haynes performed five full-length solo acoustic shows, as well as opened 23 times for The Dead and once for The Allman Brothers Band. He has also made 45 song appearances and 28 concert appearances with Dave Matthews Band, including on two released live albums: Live at Central Park Concert in 2003, in which he performed \\"Cortez, the Killer\\", and \\"Jimi Thing\\", and Live at Piedmont Park where he performed \\"What Would You Say\\". In 2005, Haynes performed a one time only show under the name Warren Haynes & Friends. The band included Abts on drums, Dave Schools of Widespread Panic on bass, John Medeski of Medeski Martin & Wood and Skerik, the avant-garde sax player of bands such as Critters Buggin' and Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. The group played a selection of blues songs, including songs of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Tom Waits, and Gov't Mule standards. The band was also featured as the house band during a number of tapings of Last Call with Carson Daly in early February 2005. During one of these tapings, the scheduled musical act was absent, so Haynes performed an acoustic rendition of U2's One. The song also appeared on his Live from Bonnaroo album. In 2008, Haynes covered the Bob Dylan song \\"I Shall Be Released\\" with Coheed and Cambria, as well as their song Welcome Home, as part of an encore the band played during their shows in support of Neverender. After recording Gov't Mule's By a Thread album, Haynes formed The Warren Haynes Band. The group included George Porter, Jr. on bass, Ivan Neville on keys and Raymond Weber on drums. Also joining them on keys was Ian McLagan, as well as vocalist Ruthie Foster and Ron Holloway on tenor sax. The Warren Haynes Band made their debut performance at Haynes' annual Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina on December 11, 2010. The album Man in Motion was released in May 2011 and debuted in the Billboard Top 20. An extensive tour occurred after the release through the rest of 2011; the touring version of the band included Holloway, drummer Terence Higgins of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, bassist Ron Johnson, keyboardist Nigel Hall, and various vocalists, either Foster, Alfreda Gerald, or Alecia Chakour. The Warren Haynes Band's \\"Live at The Moody Theater\\" 2CD/1DVD package came out in April 2012 on Stax Records. The lineup on the recording consisted of Warren Haynes (lead vocals and guitar), Ron Holloway (saxophone), Ron Johnson (bass), Terence Higgins (drums), Nigel Hall (keyboards) and Alecia Chakour (backing vocals). Haynes has stated that his further solo efforts might take him into still other fields. \\"There are other projects I want to do, too,\\" he relates. \\"I'm interested in recording a singer-songwriter oriented album with more acoustic instruments, a jazzy instrumental CD and a straight-up blues record. But like Man in Motion, those albums will have to wait until the time is right.\\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, he has remained active writing material that deals with subject matter he has not touched on in the past. Budnick, Dean https://relix.com/articles/detail/warren-haynes-on-the-power-of-live/ Relix The Christmas Jam Starting in 1988, Haynes put together an annual charity benefit show, inviting musicians originally from his home town of Asheville who were home for Christmas, the only time of year they would all be in town at the same time. The first show, held at the 45 Cherry club in Asheville on December 29, 1988, was dubbed \\"The Christmas Jam: Musician's X-Mas Reunion.\\" Some of the artists at the first Christmas Jam were Warren Haynes, Mike Barnes, Matt Sluder, The Crystal Zoo, The Stripp Band, Ronnie Burgin and the McBad Brothers Band. In the initial years the proceeds from the concert were donated to various charities but eventually the organizers decided to focus on Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit that constructs and preserves homes; advocates for fair and just housing policies; and provides training and access to resources to help families improve their shelter conditions. In tribute to his financial support of Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity, a Habitat neighborhood in Buncombe County, North Carolina, has a street named after Haynes, and another subdivision was named in honor of Warren and Stefanie Hayne's son. In 2002, Haynes was presented with the key to the city by Asheville mayor Charles Worley. In 2003, Worley proclaimed December 18 as \\"Warren Haynes Day\\" in Asheville. The event has continued to grow every year and is now dubbed \\"Warren Haynes Presents: The Christmas Jam.\\" Due to increasing audience demand, the show was eventually moved to the Asheville Civic Center. In 2008, for its twentieth anniversary, \\"The Christmas Jam\\" consisted of two nights of music; including \\"The Christmas Jam By Day,\\" a series of events including daytime concerts, movie screenings, and art, photo, and poster exhibits taking place in downtown Asheville on the days leading up to the show. The event reverted to one night in 2009, but retained \\"The Christmas Jam By Day,\\" and included the new \\"Christmas Comedy Jam.\\" The same format was repeated in 2010. Instructional videos Haynes has recorded two instructional videos: Electric Blues & Slide Guitar and Acoustic Slide and the art of Electric Improvisation. He discusses his influences and shows an array of techniques such as \\"call and response\\", string bending, vibrato, slide guitar in standard tuning and some acoustic open tuning licks in G and E tunings. For the demonstrations of the electric improvisation section of the second video, he is accompanied by Allen Woody and Matt Abts. Taping policy All of Warren Haynes' projects allow audio taping and trading. He does not approve of video recording or photography of his performances and does not provide access to soundboard patches. The Allman Brothers Band also allows taping and trading, but does not allow distribution of their shows via the internet using such applications as BitTorrent. The reason given for this restriction is that it is more communal to trade person-to-person. In a 2005 USA Today article, Haynes stated that while tape-trading may cut into band profits, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks due to an increased fanbase.accessdate=2014-05-28 Discography This discography lists those releases involving Warren Haynes, including his various bands, other projects and guest appearances. =Solo recordings and Warren Haynes Band= * Tales of Ordinary Madness, 1993 * The Lone EP, 2003 (live) * Live at Bonnaroo, 2004 (live) * Man in Motion, 2011 * Live at the Moody Theater, 2012 (live CD/DVD) * Ashes & Dust, 2015 (featuring Railroad Earth) =With The Allman Brothers Band= * Seven Turns, 1990 * Shades of Two Worlds, 1991 * An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set, 1992 (live) * Where It All Begins, 1994 * An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set, 1995 (live) * Hittin' the Note, 2003 ‚Äì also production credits * One Way Out, 2004 (live) ‚Äì also production credits * Play All Night: Live at the Beacon Theatre 1992, 2014 (live) ‚Äì also production credits =With Gov't Mule= * Gov't Mule, 1995 * Live at Roseland Ballroom, 1996 (live) * Dose, 1998 * Live...

He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.AIS Athletes at the Olympics At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles Woods, with teammates Michael Grenda, Kevin Nichols, and Michael Turtur, won the 4000m team pursuit. Critics did not give them much chance. The team was coached by Charlie Walsh and dubbed Charlie's Angels. In the final the Australians defeated the US by 3.86 seconds, even though the Australians were riding conventional bikes while the Americans had high-tech machines. Woods told The Border Mail in 2004, \\"Expectations weren't high for us from the press, but we thought we would do pretty well. We had a close team.\\" In the 4000m individual pursuit Woods was beaten for bronze by Leonard Nitz (USA). In the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul Wayne McCarney, Stephen McGlede, Scott McGrory, Brett Dutton and Woods won the bronze medal for the team pursuit, defeated by the USSR (gold) and German Democratic Republic (silver). In the individual pursuit Woods won the silver medal. Woods won a bronze medal in the team pursuit in the 1996 Summer Olympics. At the 1986 Commonwealth Games he won the individual pursuit event. In the 1990 Melbourne to Warrnambool Classic Woods set the record of 5h 12m or 50.9 km/h for this 265 km race.

It is now home to many vacation homes and cottages. Though the end of the west arm of the lake is less than from Lake Michigan, Walloon Lake's surface elevation is over higher. The Bear River drains from the east end of the lake in Walloon Lake village, winding east then north down to its outflow into Lake Michigan at the south end of Petoskey. History Walloon Lake was originally named Talcott. As the story goes, a local butcher, J. R. Haas, saw the name Walloon Lake on an old railroad map and tried to discover the history behind the name. It is thought that a group of Walloons from Belgium settled the land at the north end of the lake, which was then called Bear Lake. No trace of this settlement has ever been found. Nobel Prize winning author Earnest Hemingway spent his early summers on Walloon Lake, and his boyhood home still is occupied by relatives on Lake Grove Road. Earnest Hemingway notably recovered from World War One at Walloon, and the lake was his inspiration for a number of his works. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway_Cottage Ecology Locals refer to their cottages as being on the \\"west arm\\", or the \\"foot\\", etc. The lake covers and is primarily fed from groundwater. Its maximum depth is just over . Recently, the introduction of the invasive zebra mussel has made the clear waters even clearer. For a few months after the ice melts (usually in April), it is possible to see to the bottom of the lake at depths up to 30 feet. Current use Real-estate value has increased rapidly since the 1970s, and many large houses have been built around the lake. There are two currently active camps on the lake: Camp Daggett and Camp Michigania built on the site of the prior Camp Huntington/Sherwood which was purchased in 1962 by the University of Michigan's Alumni Associationhttps://alumni.umich.edu/camp- michigania/the-michigania-story/. Starting around 2010, the area on the foot of the lake began redevelopment. New condominiums were constructed. In the next few years, a restaurant was built, and a retail store was created on the site of the old SI's marine. In 2014 developers broke ground on a new hotel to sit in between the marina and condominiums. Transportation Indian Trails provides daily intercity bus service between St. Ignace and East Lansing, Michigan.

He was born in Montevideo, on September 3, 1791 and died on October 6, 1862. He was the son of the Treasurer of the Royal Treasury, Jacinto Acu√±a de Figueroa. Education and career Acu√±a's father sent him to study in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His early education was at the Convent of San Bernardino, and he completed his studies in Buenos Aires at the Royal College of San Carlos, from which returned in 1810, prompted by the invasion of the city, having pursued studies in Arts. He returned to Montevideo, where he wrote poems while working for his father. There was no printing press in Montevideo, so none of his works were published at that time. He went on to become the author of the words of the national anthems of Uruguay and Paraguay. He did not subscribe to the independence cause, but remained loyal to the colonial governments of Francisco Javier El√≠o and Gaspar de Vigodet, and after Montevideo fell in 1814, at 25 years old, he was exiled to the Portuguese Court in Rio de Janeiro, where he performed diplomatic functions for Spain. His father, on the other hand, remained in Montevideo, where he was confirmed in office by the new government because of his capacity for the job. He returned to Montevideo in 1818, after the fall of Jos√© Artigas, the city falling under Portuguese rule, under which it would remain. Besides his literary work, he occupied posts such as state treasurer (succeeding his father), a member of the committee on the censorship of theatrical works (in 1846), and director of the Public Library and Museum (1840‚Äì1847). Works In 1857, Acu√±a's poems were published in a book, and the national anthem of Uruguay, which dates from 1833, appeared. Acu√±a also had an extensive literary work, compiled by himself in 1848 and published posthumously in 1890 in 12 volumes under the general title of \\"Complete Works\\". It consists of numerous poems, stories, etc. Many of his works have a strong satirical tone. An anthology of his poems was published in 1965 in the collection of Uruguayan classics by the Artigas Library. One of his most curious poems is the Salve Multiforme (Multiform Salve), about which the author says: Salve Multiforme has two applications, two different objectives. The first, most essential and specific objective is purely religious, the second has a secular or political application. Under that first aspect it is a tribute of veneration and applause inexhaustible to the divine queen of heaven, it is the prayer of the Salve presented and reproducible in almost infinite ways: so many that many millions of years of continuous and incessant reading would not be enough to complete all possible paraphrases of this more or less diverse prayer, which, according to this method, can be formed. (...) The author has divided the salve into 44 fragments, placed successively in as many columns, numbered from 1 to 44. Each fragment has, in its own column, 26 paraphrases of itself, or at least similar related words, and combined with any of the 27 fragments of the preceding and subsequent columns, without breaking the sense of the Salve, which always maintains its grammatical syntax, without repeating, in an entire Salve, a fragment already used in it. (...) As a result, therefore, taking at random any fragment from the 1st column, another one from the 2nd, another from the 3rd., etc.., continuing that way up to column 44, a complete paraphrase of the salve will always be formed, perhaps elegant, perhaps weak, but never inappropriate or incoherent in its meaning. Having, therefore, 27 fragments in the 1st column, freely combined with any of the following 27 and these with the successive column, and so progressively and mutually with the other columns, it is evident that millions upon millions of Salves can be combined and merged, more or less differently, i.e., with more or fewer differences among fragments. On reaching column 44 the word amen is added, which is in the last or supplementary column, to properly end each of the prayers. Acu√±a also wrote the lyrics for the national anthem of Paraguay. He died in Montevideo on October 6, 1862.

The first \\"season\\" of the game had players looking for \\"The Receda Cube\\" (referred to simply as \\"The Cube\\"), a priceless scientific and spiritual artifact to the people of a fictional metropolis known as \\"Perplex City\\", that had been stolen and buried somewhere on Earth. The game offered a real-life ¬£100,000 reward (approx. $130,000 or ‚Ç¨115,000) to whoever found it. Like most alternate reality games, the story of Perplex City is told through blogs, puzzles, and other various media. The game began in April 2005, and was won by Andy Darley of Middlesex, UK, who found The Cube in a wooded area in Northamptonshire, UK on 2 February 2007.Digital Treasure Hunt gets Winner, a BBC story. According to Mind Candy, the first wave of cards for the new game season, called Perplex City Stories, would be released on March 1, 2007. However, in June 2007, they released an announcement which declared that the second season was on indefinite hold.  Background = Perplex City = Perplex City is a massive fictitious metropolis that has an unknown number of connections to Earth. It has a near-future feel to it, with advanced mobile technology, neuro-enhancing pharmaceuticals and kilometer-high skyscrapers. There is also a slightly more Utopian element to city life than we commonly find on Earth. The most important characteristic of the city's culture is the importance they place on puzzles and other mental pursuits. Their leading competitive event, the Academy Games, is primarily a competition of intellectual skill rather than physical strength. In fact, nearly every part of their culture touches upon the cryptic and mind. Their religions fall loosely around a mythology of building, construction and technology, none of which are explicitly theistic. The Cube is, in all cases, a sacred and holy object, and rightfully so. It possesses a range of unusual properties which many believe to be of a supernatural origin. = Citizens of Perplex City = Key figures in city life include Sente Kiteway, Master of The Academy (The academy being an advanced learning institution in the city) and former custodian of the Cube. His two daughters, Scarlett and Violet, communicate regularly with the people of Earth through their blogs. Pietro Salk, an investigative reporter for leading newspaper The Sentinel, produced many leads before he was unceremoniously killed off for getting too close to the truth. The team at the Academy tasked with returning the Cube (and ostensibly authors of the puzzle cards) are also frequently in touch, and Kurt McAllister is an important ally to players on Earth.  Plot  An artifact called the Receda Cube (pronounced /Reh-kay- duh/) is stolen from the Perplex City Academy and makes its way to Earth. A Cube Retrieval Team (CRT) is formed to search for the Cube. Because citizens of Perplex City are unable to travel to Earth, the Master of Perplex City Academy, Sente Kiteway, asks for help in finding the Cube from the citizens of Earth, offering to share any leads or clues that he or the CRT may get. Clues to the location of the Cube are periodically left by the person who stole it, known only as Combed Thunderclap. It is discovered that an organization called the Third Power and a Cube-worshipping cult called the Reconstructionists are also looking for the Cube. While the people of Earth are left to search for the Cube on Earth, various citizens of Perplex City, particularly Kurt McAllister and Sente‚Äôs two daughters, Scarlett and Violet, attempt to find additional clues in Perplex City and to discover the identity of Combed Thunderclap. The former three discover the lab in which the Cube was made. They find that the Cube was built by Sente and can be used as a weapon and a teleporter. The Cube is finally found by the people of Earth in Northamptonshire, England; they also determine that it was Violet who stole the Cube and hid it on Earth,Violet Underground in an effort to keep it out of the hands of the Third Power. Puzzle cards Mind Candy sells a series of collectible puzzle cards. They are sold in booster packs, with each pack containing six random cards from the total possible 256 cards. Cards are divided into sets and subsets of varying rarity and difficulty. Unlike CCGs such as Magic: The Gathering or Pok√©mon, though, the cards are not designed for competitive player-versus-player \\"combat\\". Instead, each card depicts a different puzzle, with the rarer cards also featuring more complex riddles. Cards are marked with unique identifiers which can then be entered onto the Perplex City website, earning points and a place on a leaderboard. Many cards contain hidden features, such as ultraviolet or heat-sensitive inks, and they cover a broad range of themes from pop-culture trivia to cryptography and logic brainteasers. Each card is a member of a four-card set. If all four cards are solved by a player, they receive double points for each card in the set. = Unsolved cards = As of February 2020, two cards from the first season are yet to be solved: * Riemann (S1, Card #238) apparently asks players to prove the Riemann hypothesis. * Billion to One (S1, Card #256) features the face of a man, with a caption in Japanese that reads ÁßÅ„ÇíË¶ã„Å§„Åë„Å™„Åï„ÅÑ, which translates to \\"Find Me.\\" His image has been spread to social networking sites, in attempts to locate and make contact with this person. = Out of print cards = Two cards are no longer in circulation. The cards were excluded from wave-three print runs because they did not fit on the print layout. While these problems have been rectified, Mind Candy has no plans to replace or reprint these cards in the future. They are: *Card #238 (Riemann) - chosen to be excluded due to the complete inability of the card to be solved for the foreseeable future. *Card #245 (Relativity) - chosen to be excluded more or less at random, but the decision was no doubt influenced by the fact that the problem and solution are quite complex.  ARG features  The puzzle cards are intended as an introduction to the characters and story of Perplex City itself, and the deeper mysteries of the Cube theft. Clues found on the cards direct players to various websites, blogs, emails, phone calls, and SMS messages, originating from Perplex City. These often feature puzzles of their own, whose solutions lead to further puzzles. Frequently these puzzles require players to co-operate in reaching various goals. Perplex City has been running since late 2004, much longer than the traditional ARG. Its longevity has allowed for a number of events that simply would not be possible within a two- month traditional lifespan of an ARG. Some examples of this include: * Players wrote a book to enable a character to become a \\"published author\\" and gain access to relevant archives.Seaside Press , in-game website with a real-life link to purchase the book online. * A full-length CD of cryptic techno music was released by a Perplexian musician. * A banner plane flew across Manchester with a keyword that enabled access to a new area of the game. * Sixty players attended an in-game event in search for clues, only for one of their own to be revealed as a mole and escape in a black helicopter.PXC Live Event: A Mole Amongst Thee ARGN, October 30, 2005 * 220 people participated in the first Perplex City Academy Games in London, a high-tech scavenger hunt across the capital.London Live Event from Perplex City official site. A month later, a similar event was held in New York.New York PCAG Tournament The Scarlett Kite, March 8, 2006  Board Game  In late 2006, Mind Candy released Perplex City: The Board Game. Players solve anagrams, logic problems, visual puzzles, and trivia questions to collect a set of colored stones. Players can also challenge one another for their collected stones. To win, the last stone must be collected through challenging another player. The rules insert maintains an in-universe approach to Perplex City, giving background about its puzzle- loving citizens and a fictional history of the board game.  Mind Candy  The Mind Candy cards were first released in select outlets arounds the world, but are increasingly readily available from retailers both on- and offline. On September 7, 2006, Mind Candy announced that GameStop was to begin carrying Perplex City cards in 700 stores in the United States.Perplex City News accessed September 26, 2006 As of September 26, 2006, some 682,425 cards have been marked as solved on the Perplex City leaderboard, with 45,215 players registered. Mind Candy received a round of venture capital worth $3 million from Index Ventures, an investor in Skype and other technology companies.VCs invest in alternate reality ZDNet News: December 6, 2005 In June 2007 Mind Candy announced that it would be putting season 2 of its ARG on hold indefinitely. Mind Candy's focus later moved to the Moshi Monsters franchise and the Perplex City project was abandoned. Reception The reviewer from the online second volume of Pyramid stated that \\"The object of the game is, well . . . that depends. The whole game is incremental. At its simplest, the idea is to solve the poser on a card. If you want to become 200,000 very real dollars richer (apparently they can do bank transfers across the dimensional gulf), you need to suck as much information as you can out of as many sources as you can, including the cards, some scattered websites, and even real people (or their cell phones), to unlock where on Earth the Cube has been hidden.\\"  See also  * Alternate reality game * Masquerade (book) * Eric Harshbarger, Perplex City puzzle designer * Andrea Phillips, Perplex City writer & designer * Naomi Alderman, Perplex City writer * Russell Tate, Perplex City Illustrator ReferencesExternal links *User-run catalog of all available puzzle cards *Wiki Project Category:Alternate reality games Category:Puzzles ","title":"Perplex City"},{"id":"2285139","text":"Cyril \\"Sonny\\" Moorman (born 1955) is an American power blues guitarist. His style is sometimes compared to that of the Duane Allman, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Lonnie Mack, Gov't Mule, and occasionally Warren Haynes. Moorman's parents owned a nightclub called the \\"Half-Way Inn\\" located halfway between Hamilton, Ohio and Middletown, Ohio on Ohio State Route 4 where he was able to watch musicians who played there, such as Lonnie Mack, from an early age. Moorman attended Michigan State University and also graduated from the Musicians Institute in Hollywood. He also owned a music lesson studio in Fairfield, Ohio called Rock School, and now offers guitar lessons out of 3rd Street Music in Hamilton, Ohio. He has been a member of Warren Zevon's touring band and the Tomcats with members of Sly and the Family Stone. One of his signature tunes is his cover of Lonnie Mack's Cincinnati Jail.

Cryptography is used to protect digital information on computers as well as the digital information that is sent to other computers over the Internet. Classification There are many software products which provide encryption. Software encryption uses a cipher to obscure the content into ciphertext. One way to classify this type of software is by the type of cipher used. Ciphers can be divided into two categories: public key ciphers (also known as asymmetric ciphers), and symmetric key ciphers. Encryption software can be based on either public key or symmetric key encryption. Another way to classify software encryption is to categorize its purpose. Using this approach, software encryption may be classified into software which encrypts \\"data in transit\\" and software which encrypts \\"data at rest\\". Data in transit generally uses public key ciphers, and data at rest generally uses symmetric key ciphers. Symmetric key ciphers can be further divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers typically encrypt plaintext a bit or byte at a time, and are most commonly used to encrypt real-time communications, such as audio and video information. The key is used to establish the initial state of a keystream generator, and the output of that generator is used to encrypt the plaintext. Block cipher algorithms split the plaintext into fixed-size blocks and encrypt one block at a time. For example, AES processes 16-byte blocks, while its predecessor DES encrypted blocks of eight bytes. There is also a well-known case where PKI is used for data in transit of data at rest. Data in transit Data in transit is data that is being sent over a computer network. When the data is between two endpoints, any confidential information may be vulnerable. The payload (confidential information) can be encrypted to secure its confidentiality, as well as its integrity and validity. Often, the data in transit is between two entities that do not know each other - such as in the case of visiting a website. As establishing a relationship and securely sharing an encryption key to secure the information that will be exchanged, a set of roles, policies, and procedures to accomplish this has been developed; it is known as the public key infrastructure, or PKI. Once PKI has established a secure connection, a symmetric key can be shared between endpoints. A symmetric key is preferred to over the private and public keys as a symmetric cipher is much more efficient (uses less CPU cycles) than an asymmetric cipher. There are several methods for encrypting data in transit, such as IPsec, SCP, SFTP, SSH, OpenPGP and HTTPS. Data at rest Data at rest refers to data that has been saved to persistent storage. Data at rest is generally encrypted by a symmetric key. Encryption may be applied at different layers in the storage stack. For example, encryption can be configured at the disk layer, on a subset of a disk called a partition, on a volume, which is a combination of disks or partitions, at the layer of a file system, or within user space applications such as database or other applications that run on the host operating system. With full disk encryption, the entire disk is encrypted (except for the bits necessary to boot or access the disk when not using an unencrypted boot/preboot partition). As disks can be partitioned into multiple partitions, partition encryption can be used to encrypt individual disk partitions. Volumes, created by combining two or more partitions, can be encrypted using volume encryption.https://www.jetico.com/web_help/bcve3_enterprise/html/01_introduction/02_what_is_ve.htm Volume Encryption File systems, also composed of one or more partitions, can be encrypted using filesystem-level encryption. Directories are referred to as encrypted when the files within the directory are encrypted. File encryption encrypts a single file. Database encryption acts on the data to be stored, accepting unencrypted information and writing that information to persistent storage only after it has encrypted the data. Device-level encryption, a somewhat vague term that includes encryption-capable tape drives, can be used to offload the encryption tasks from the CPU. Transit of data at rest When there is a need to securely transmit data at rest, without the ability to create a secure connection, user space tools have been developed that support this need. These tools rely upon the receiver publishing their public key, and the sender being able to obtain that public key. The sender is then able to create a symmetric key to encrypt the information, and then use the receiver's public key to securely protect the transmission of the information and the symmetric key. This allows secure transmission of information from one party to another. Below are some examples of software that provide this type of encryption. * GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) * Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Performance The performance of encryption software is measured relative to the speed of the CPU. Thus cycles per byte (sometimes abbreviated cpb), indicating the number of clock cycles a microprocessor will perform per byte of data processed, are the usual unit of measurement. Cycles per byte serve as a partial indicator of real-world performance in cryptographic functions. Applications may offer their own encryption called native encryption, including databases applications such as Microsoft SQL, Oracle, and MongoDB, and commonly rely on direct usage of CPU cycles for performance. This often impacts the desirability of encryption in businesses seeking greater security and ease of satisfying compliance, by impacting the speed and scale of how data within organizations through to their partners.

Angelos (born July 4, 1929) is an American trial lawyer and baseball executive from Baltimore, Maryland. Angelos is the majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, a team in the American League of Major League Baseball.  Early life and education  Angelos is the son of John (a bar owner) and Frances Angelos, who immigrated to the United States from Menetes, Karpathos, Greece. Peter Angelos married Georgia Kousouris in 1966, and they had two children together, John and Louis. Angelos' family settled in the working- class neighborhood of Highlandtown, and lived in a row house. Angelos' father owned a local tavern, and his father mostly spoke Greek at home. After graduating from Patterson Park High School, Angelos attended the University of Baltimore, where he earned a bachelor's degree. He then attended law school at night at the University of Baltimore School of Law, and was named class valedictorian.  Career =Law practice= Angelos passed the bar in 1961 and opened an office specializing in handling product-liability cases for employees, almost always on a contingency basis. In one of his cases, he represented some 8,700 steelworkers, shipyard workers, and manufacturers' employees in a consolidated-action asbestos poisoning suit that was partially settled in 1992. Angelos' take from that litigation alone has been estimated at $330 million. He served a brief stint on the Baltimore City Council and ran for mayor on the city's first interracial ticket in 1967, and lost. In March 1996 Maryland hired Angelos to represent the state in its suit against tobacco companies with a 25% contingency fee. After Angelos filed suit on behalf of the state the trial court ruled that the state's recovery would be limited to subrogation of losses through programs such as Medicaid; this would have effectively ended the state's case. Angelos successfully lobbied the state legislature to change the law to allow the state's suit to proceed. The state legislature also cut Angelos' fee to 12.5%. Eventually he settled for $150 million paid over five years. Angelos also represented the state of Maryland in a suit against Philip Morris and suing Wyeth, the makers of part of the diet pill combination fen-phen. As of 2019, Angelos's law firm currently had offices in Baltimore, Towson, and Cumberland, Maryland; Philadelphia, Bethlehem, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Knoxville, Tennessee. The firm is headquartered in the historic One Charles Center building in downtown Baltimore which was purchased by Angelos for $6 million in 1996. =Politics= A lifelong Democrat, Angelos began his political career with an unsuccessful run for State Senate in 1958. He went on to hold a seat on the Baltimore City Council from 1959 to 1963. He was the first Greek-American to be elected to the council. Though Angelos became known for demanding governmental oversight and fiscal responsibility, few of his calls for investigations into city agencies and spending led to lasting change. In 1963 he ran unsuccessfully for City Council President, losing to Thomas D'Alesandro III, scion and namesake of a popular former Mayor of Baltimore. He lost the primary for the 1967 Baltimore Mayor's race (on the city's first racially integrated ticket, as Clarence Mitchell III was running for City Council President)‚Äîagain to D'Alesandro, who received nearly 75% of the vote and went on to beat Republican Arthur W. Sherwood in the general election. Three times in the 1960s he unsuccessfully challenged Republican incumbents in the Maryland Legislature. He has also used his influence with the small business community to call for the continuation of Maryland's Contributory negligence laws while most of the United States has adopted the more equitable distributory negligence system. Angelos donated $272,000 to the independent expenditure-only committee (Super PAC) Draft Biden which sought to induce Vice President Joe Biden to enter the 2016 Democratic Primary for President. =Horse racing= Angelos breeds and races Thoroughbred horses and in 1998 purchased the Ross Valley Farm in Baltimore County. =Baltimore Orioles= In 1993 Angelos assembled a group of investors to purchase the Orioles from New York venture capitalist Eli Jacobs. While Angelos was the principal investor, contributing $40 million, his fellow Oriole group owners included novelist Tom Clancy, filmmaker Barry Levinson, and tennis player Pam Shriver. On October 4, 1993, Jacobs sold the Orioles to Angelos' group for $173 million, the highest price paid for a sports franchise at that time. Angelos took over as managing partner and principal owner of the team. His official titles with the club are Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Angelos immediately became a hands-on owner and was willing to pay high salaries to talented free agents. Under Angelos' direction, the Orioles signed four high-priced free agents in 1994: Rafael Palmeiro, Sid Fernandez, Chris Sabo, and Lee Smith. As one of the newest members of the elite group of baseball owners, Angelos was expected to abide by the owners' decisions quietly without offering any alternatives or using his experience with labor law to negotiate with the players' union. Angelos did not like that arrangement and he did not particularly care if the world found out. When the other owners signed a document cancelling the rest of the 1994 baseball season, including the World Series, Angelos refused to sign it because it blamed the players for the impasse. When the owners formed a committee to negotiate the strike, they did not include Angelos, despite his experience as a labor-management negotiator. When talks between the players and the owners stalled in December 1994, and the owners voted to impose a salary cap, Angelos was one of three dissenters to the arrangement. What brought him into the public eye, however, was his refusal to field replacement players should the strike last into the 1995 major league baseball season. Angelos announced his decision about replacement players early in 1995 and was hailed in blue-collar Baltimore as a champion of the worker. As his fellow owners mulled what action to take against Angelos‚Äîeverything from a $250,000 fine for each game missed to forcing the sale of the Orioles‚Äîthe strike was finally settled in time for regular season play with major leaguers. Angelos arranged for a two-game exhibition series to be played between the Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team in 1999. The Orioles won the first game, played in Havana, while the Cuban team won the second game, held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. In 2000, the team's general manager, Syd Thrift, told The Washington Times that the team had a practice of not signing players who had defected from Cuba, which he attributed to Angelos' desire to avoid doing \\"anything that could be interpreted as being disrespectful\\" by the Cuban government. Angelos denied the existence of such a policy. Subsequent investigations by Major League Baseball and the United States Department of Justice did not find evidence that the absence of Cuban players on the Orioles' roster or in its minor league system was due to discrimination.Probe of Orioles finds no violations The Washington Times Since he became owner of the Orioles, Angelos has been a controversial figure. In the early years of his ownership, Angelos was repeatedly criticized by the The Baltimore Sun for the team's performance, but has been praised by his associates for his work ethic and dedication. His stance during the 1994 baseball strike was extremely popular with fans. Critics accused Angelos rapidly hiring and firing baseball managers, and reportedly overruling their decisions. However, Angelos' decision to hire Andy MacPhail as the team's General Manager and President of Baseball Operations in 2007 was met with general approval. In May 2009, a Sports Illustrated article reviewing owners of Major League Baseball franchises rated Angelos as the worst owner in the Major Leagues. The article notes that the methodology \\"was not scientific\\" and \\"weighing heavily in the decision was the team's success or failure on the field.\\" Two weeks later, Brady Anderson, a member of the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame, responded in an op-ed to The Baltimore Sun, writing that Angelos deserves to be on a list of the \\"best owners in baseball.\\" On April 16, 2010, a Fox Sports article suggested that Angelos allegedly denied a job to Cal Ripken, Jr. when Ripken offered to come work for the franchise in a supporting role to help the O's young talent develop. A day later, ESPN, MLB.com and The Baltimore Sun wrote that the Fox Sports story was inaccurate.If Ripken calls, Orioles owner interested MLB.com Angelos denied that the two had spoken about potential opportunities with the Baltimore Orioles, but said he welcomed future discussions on the topic.Orioles' Angelos denies that Ripken requested job in front office The Baltimore SunOrioles ready to talk if Ripken wants job ESPN On April 19, 2010, Cal Ripken Jr. issued a statement denying the Fox Sports story. In the statement, Ripken expressed an interest in returning to baseball and described his relationship with Angelos as \\"very good.\\" Ripken has considered return to Orioles MLB.com Angelos' health began to fail in recent years, and his sons Louis and John began to take on more leadership roles in the Orioles as he focused more on his health. In February 2019, Major League Baseball informed the Orioles that they had until June to inform the League on who was currently controlling the team. This would require the team to name a new control person to represent them, although it would have no bearing on who succeed Angelos as principal owner. In October 2019 John P. Angelos, vice president of the Orioles, stated that neither he nor his father Peter had any plans to relocate the Orioles outside of Baltimore, contrary to rumors. Charity Angelos is known for various acts of charity and philanthropy, having contributed millions to civic and community institutions around Maryland. He has donated millions of dollars to Democratic Party and its candidates, and is a major supporter of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation (Baltimore, Maryland). He is the largest individual donor to the University of Baltimore and pledged $5 million to the school in 2008. In 2010, The Baltimore Sun reported that Angelos had recently donated $10 million to the university.Peter Angelos remains a powerful paradox The Baltimore Sun The same report notes that during the particularly hot summer of 2010, Angelos anonymously donated $300,000 to keep Baltimore city pools open. =Awards= He was named \\"Marylander of the Year\\" by The Baltimore Sun in 1988, with a citation that read: \\"Measured by professional accomplishments and contributions to his city and region, he is the Marylander of this decade.\\" Angelos was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1996.Peter Angelos, Esq.

Band 2: Das 19. Jahrhundert und gro√üe Themen der Geschichte Preu√üens. Verlag De Gruyter, Berlin 1992, , p. 340 books.google It embodied agreements between the two principal powers of the German Confederation, Prussia and Austria, over the governing of the 'Elbe Duchies' of Schleswig, Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg. Background Schleswig (until 1864 Danish fief), Holstein and Lauenburg (until 1864 German Confederation) The Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been united under Danish rule since 1460. While Schleswig north of the Eider River was a Danish fief, the Duchies of Holstein officially remained an estate of the Holy Roman Empire which the Kings of Denmark held as an Imperial fief. In 1815 King Frederick VI of Denmark also acquired the adjacent Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. Both Holstein and Lauenburg were member states of the German Confederation since 1815. When in 1858 the Danish national liberal Council President Carl Christian Hall drafted the 'November Constitution' in order to link Schleswig more closely to the Danish kingdom, he sparked German protests, and troops of the German Confederation eventually occupied Holstein and Lauenburg in 1863. In the following Second Schleswig War, Denmark was defeated and according to the Treaty of Vienna signed on 30 October 1864 had to cede the Elbe Duchies to victorious Prussia and Austria. After the war, the two powers faced the issue of governing the provinces formerly held by the Danish royal House of Gl√ºcksburg in personal union. Prussia aimed at the annexation of the territories as provinces with her state territory, against the strong resistance of the Austrians, who persisted on the status of autonomous duchies of the Confederation ruled as a condominium. To ease tensions, the Prussian minister-president Otto von Bismarck met with the Austrian envoy Gustav von Blome at the spa town of Bad Gastein in the Austrian Alps. Content In the negotiations, the administration of the gained territories was split between the two powers: Prussia would rule over Schleswig and Austria over Holstein. Austria would officially renounce Saxe-Lauenburg, which would be ruled by the Prussian king in personal union for a purchase price of 2.5 million Danish rigsdalers. The eleven articles of the agreement signed on 14 August 1865 covered: * abandoning the shared administration (condominium) of Schleswig and Holstein * Prussian control of Schleswig * Austrian control of Holstein (which was sandwiched between Schleswig to the north and Prussian Lauenburg to the south) * the Prussian crown purchasing Austria's right to Lauenburg * Prussian transit rights on military roads through Holstein to Schleswig * Prussian rights to construct a canal and a telegraph-line through Holstein to Schleswig * setting up a German Confederation Navy * designating a headquarters for the proposed navy at Kiel in Holstein under Prussian sovereignty * designating Rendsburg as a Fortress of the German Confederation. The treaty was ratified by both parties on 19 August. King William I of Prussia went on to rule Lauenburg in personal union and assumed the ducal title. Aftermath Prime Minister Bismarck, 1862 Bismarck's negotiation skills had apparently been underestimated by Blome. Though Prussia benefitted from the treaty, the minister-president noted that the 'bonding of cracks' did not answer the German question nor did it ease the Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry. Moreover the treaty ran counter to the legal basis of the German Confederation, which led to the refusal by the smaller Confederation states and turned out detrimental to the reputation especially of the Austrian side. The European powers reacted strongly, the French emperor Napoleon III responded with protest, while the British saw their interests in the North Sea as threatened; the treaty was nevertheless appreciated by Russia in view of her enmity with Austria after the Crimean War. The Gastein Convention marked the end of all attempts to seek a peaceful solution of the German question. It soon collapsed due to Bismarck's successful efforts to provoke a war with the Austrian Empire as well as to eliminate Austria from the German Confederation. The Austrian government had tolerated the rule of Duke Frederick VIII of Schleswig- Holstein, much to the chagrin of Prussia. On 1 June 1866 Austria asked the Federal Convention for a resolution on the status of Holstein, which Prussia regarded as a breach of the mutual agreement. Under this pretext, Prussian troops entered Holstein nine days later which led to the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, also known as the Seven Weeks' War. The Peace of Prague in 1866 confirmed Denmark's cession of Schlewig and Holstein, which were both annexed by Prussia, but promised a plebiscite to decide whether north Schleswig wished to return to Danish rule. This provision was bilaterally set aside by a resolution of Prussia and Austria in 1878. Instead the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein was created in 1868. Both territories were to be admitted to the Zollverein (German Customs Union), headed by Prussia, of which Austria was not a member.

Overview Songs from the Inverted Womb builds on the chamber music-inspired sound of the Dead Lovers' Sarabande albums by adding more conventional song structures and by adding a live drummer. With even more expressive arrangements and enhanced songwriting, Inverted Womb shares many properties with progressive rock.

As the album is dedicated to \\"Little Seven\\", much of the lyrics revolves around finding and caring for the dead boy, as well as other dead children; most of the lyrical imagery revolves around familial plots in small towns in the Middle Ages. \\"Saturn devouring his Children\\" deals with necrophagia (the act of eating a corpse), while \\"There was a Country by the Sea\\" is an epic tale of finding a boy in a foreign land who has built a catacomb underneath his house; the boy explains to the protagonist that he was able to seal away his mother's bones using \\"jet-black granules\\" \\"piled up in a certain, specific form\\", but he remains ever vigilant in the tomb so that she will not return to life. \\"R√©sum√©... -\\" was used by Bam Margera in two of his films: Haggard: The Movie and CKY3; \\"Eldorado\\" also made an appearance in CKY3.

Davidson, 405 U.S. 34 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case resulting in the grant of habeas corpus relief to a soldier, Joseph Parisi, seeking an honorable discharge as a conscientious objector. The case was argued on October 19 and 20, 1971, and decided on February 23, 1972. The respondent was then Major General Phillip B. Davidson. Parisi had brought a petition to Federal District Court that the Army's refusal to discharge him constituted habeas corpus - that in effect he was being unlawfully imprisoned. As a result, court-martial charges were brought against him by the Army.

Clothing frequently articulates rank or privilege, but accessories and external entities of varying functionality may also serve to mark out leaders - from finger rings to personal aircraft. Presidential symbols Presidential symbols include many various insignia or other devices to denote a president's position. Some symbols follow accepted constitutional or diplomatic standards: flags, sashes, entrance Marches or a medallion or necklace. The use of the symbols mostly occurs for domestic purposes. Examples of such symbols include the American presidential march \\"Hail to the Chief\\", and the presidential sashes worn by the presidents of Latin America nations. More practical, semi-symbolic features also abound: bodyguards may lurk semi- overtly; a head of state may use a special aircraft (see for example Air Force One). European presidents sometimes dress archaically for formal occasions. Such special clothing sets them apart - and may well militate against women aspiring to such high office when tradition expects them to wear (say) knee- breeches. Royal/Imperial symbols Ruling dynasties often exploit pomp and ceremony with the use of regalia: crowns, robes, orb and sceptres, some of which are reflections of formerly practical objects. The use of language mechanisms also support this differentiation with subjects talking of \\"the crown\\" and/or of \\"the throne\\" rather than referring directly to personal names and items. Monarchies provide the most explicit demonstration of tools to strengthen the elevation of leaders. Thrones sit high on daises leading to subjects lifting their gaze (if they have permission) to contemplate the ruler. Architecture in general can set leaders apart: note the symbolism inherent in the very name of the Chinese imperial Forbidden City. The culture and legends about the ruling family may build on myths of divine-right and describe the ruler or the Son of Heaven. Court ceremonial highlights symbolic distance between a royal/imperial leader and follower, in a hierarchical system which cultivates a social system and power network at whose centre is the monarch. Bowing and curtseying remain as examples of the self-abasement of hand-sucking, bowing and scraping, prostration, kowtowing and proskynesis formerly demanded. Sometimes colour plays a special role in advertising monarchical status: thus the once very rare pink/maroon dye color became a symbol reserved for imperial clothing - see purple. Archaic touches often symbolically recall a glorious historical past: thus horse-drawn carriages replace everyday motor-vehicles for royal state occasions, and courtiers and flunkeys in elaborate dress grant a sense of ancient distance. And monarchs emphasize the remaining traces of their divine right to rule when undergoing anointing at the hands of the Church during coronation ceremonies. Socio- political leadership symbols Overlapping with and/or emulating royalty, a ruling class or an aristocracy can devote much of its energy into \\"keeping up appearances\\" and emphasizing the purity of noble blood by apartness. Symbolism can aid this process cheaply. A coat-of-arms (perhaps in the form of a banner or on note-paper) or the wearing of a sword can incur less expense than maintaining a stately home. The visible presence of servants or slaves reminds underlings of social distance. Patronage, especially of fashion, provides one of the most symbolic attributes of social leaders or would-be leaders. Compare conspicuous consumption. Military leadership symbols Apart from more elaborate uniform and their distinguishing marks (epaulettes, caps, medals), senior military officers may traditionally carry a baton or affect a similar substitute (such as a swagger stick or cane). Compare staff of office. Banners, pennants and guidons serve (or served in the past) to identify leaders as rallying-points or field command-posts. Traces of these continue on staff cars or on naval ships, for example: see broad pennant and compare the concept and origin of a flagship. Ecclesiastical leadership symbols Religious dignitaries often use vestments to emphasize the overall sacred nature of their organization. But some touches identify leaders and make them more imposing: a bishop's mitre, for example, a cardinal's red hat, a papal tiara or a papal ring. Less flamboyant faiths may use subtler symbolism to set religious leadership, holiness or saintliness apart: the understated dark vestments of the Protestant clergyman, the relatively unobtrusive clerical collar, or even the nakedness of a stereotypical Hindu ascetic fakir. Gender-related leadership symbols Ownership of a harem has both practical and symbolic uses for leaders in traditional polygamous societies: harems spread genes and symbolically demonstrate wealth and status. Within such harems whole systems of symbolism may develop: the use of exclusive and inaccessible apartness, veiling, and the employment of eunuchs. Cultures which practise serial monogamy feature harem-analogous symbolism in the flaunting of trophy wives. Items such as codpieces may suggest the assumed superiority of one gender-role over another: or symbolic leadership (implied by implied potency) within patriarchal structures. A slightly less extreme example, but one more common in modern times, expresses power relationships (and thus leadership symbolism) through the use of the phrase \\"wearing the trousers\\". Ancient Egyptian pharaohs used a stylised artificial labdanum-soaked goats- hair beard as one of the regalia of rulership: a clear case of associating a male attribute with leadership. Symbols of leadership in offices The suit continues to mark out the managerial class (which pretends to leadership functions) as a whole from ordinary blue-collar or non-suited workers. Suits stand at the apex of a system of dress code details: international standard business attire, with largely symbolic associations; see for example: * Collar (clothing) * Business casual * Necktie * White-collar worker At the top levels of a bureaucratic organisation, senior leaders often attempt to merge the practical with the symbolic, making the perks of office appear functional: they may claim larger cars, smaller computers, an entrance guarded by a (non- digital) personal assistant, a large but uncluttered desk and (especially) a \\"corner office\\" with an aesthetically uplifting view.

It was developed by Nextech and Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Sega in 2003 (Japan), THQ (2004, Europe) and Atlus USA (2004, America), as the sequel to Shining Soul and part of the Shining series. The game is a dungeon crawling hack and slash, playing similarly to Diablo or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. It features eight playable characters, ten dungeons tied into a storyline, and eight hidden dungeons to explore. The game supports multiplayer via link cable as well as single player. Gameplay The game features eight character classes which can be improved up to level 200. Each is customisable with a variety of weapons, spells, support abilities, and attributes. Different classes who can use the same weapons attack differently with them. For example, the Warrior's spear attack is a thrust, while the Archer throws his spear over a distance. Each usable spell in the game has its own spellbook, and only classes with that spell on their skills list can use the spellbook to cast the spell. *Warrior - A well balanced melee class. Default name: Eric (Alex in Japanese). *Archer - Attacks from afar using bows and spears, and summons forest creatures. Default name: Rwinn (Luin in Japanese). *Sorceress - Uses a variety of offensive elemental spells from a distance. Default name: Premiera (Pamela in Japanese). *Dragonute - The slowest but toughest melee class. Default name: Tyroth (Tiros in Japanese). *Priestess - Specializes in healing and support spells. Default name: Prim. *Dark Wizard - Uses Dark elemental spells. Default name: Armand (Bloodstar in Japanese). *Brawler - The most powerful and quick offensive melee class, but suffers from low defense. Default name: Zachs (Sachs in Japanese). *Ninja - A swift medium-ranged class using a mix of spells and physical attacks. Default name: Raizen. *??? - A Dark wizard similar to Armand; secret character who becomes available after beating the game once. Has no default name. Each character is able to equip up to three weapons and three items for use, and switch between them at any time. The player can get 3 extra slots for either by equipping the Backpack or Knapsack. Attacks are performed by tapping the attack button, or holding to charge a more powerful attack. Beyond regular equipment, a \\"Soul\\" item can also be equipped; it is charged by defeating enemies, and unleashed to inflict massive damage on nearby enemies. They come in various elemental types and levels of effectiveness. They are graded on the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV and V, with V being the strongest and taking the longest to charge up. Characters also have resistances to a number of elements: Fire, Ice, Thunder, Light, Dark and Poison. These can be raised by equipment, but also through endurance: by taking damage of a particular elemental kind, they can increase their resistance to it, but being killed by an attack of that type will decrease the resistance level by a point. =Multiplayer= The multiplayer is very similar to that of Diablo. The player characters navigate the dungeon and attack monsters. Players can give items to each other by throwing or dropping them. The party can only move to the next area when every player character has either passed the exit point of the current area or died. Opening the inventory window does not pause the game (in singleplayer or multiplayer), so some players can reorganize their inventory while others engage in combat. Some classes are more useful in multiplayer, such as the priestess or archer. Plot Shining Soul II has little connection to the storyline of the rest of the series aside from a reference to the events of Shining Soul in the introduction. However, an alternate universe version of Boken from Shining Force appears as a major NPC, traditional Shining mascot Yogurt is hidden in one of the stages, and a number of dungeons from the original Shining Soul appear as short hidden dungeons. Centuries after the defeat of Dark Dragon in Shining Soul, light had become too strong, opening the way to a resurgence of darkness. A crystal in the possession of King Marcel and Queen Yvonne of Klantol, which throughout the story reflects the current balance of light and darkness, turns from shining to cloudy. An alchemist named Gillespie, a member of a dark order, the Chaos Knights, worms his way into the friendship of King Marcel's most trusted knight, Deatharte. Gillespie then disappears, leaving something called \\"the forbidden fruit\\" with Deatharte. Driven by curiosity, Deatharte eventually eats the fruit and is corrupted by darkness. Later, a tournament at the Klantol Colosseum is interrupted by news that Princess Camille has been abducted. King Marcel orders Deatharte to search for her. Deatharte pretends to obey, but instead goes to join the Chaos Knights. Since Marcel is also concerned about an army of goblins mustering near the castle, he sends a promising young participant in the tournament (the player character) to investigate. Penetrating the goblin fort, the young hero not only confirms that the goblins were planning an attack on the castle, but learns that they abducted Camille and delivered her to the evil witch Wizari, who plans to sacrifice her to increase her power. The hero defeats the goblins and recovers the key to Camille's prison. Since Deatharte has naturally still not returned, Marcel relies upon the young hero to journey to Wizari's palace and save Camille. He succeeds in doing this and slaying Wizari. The celebration is short-lived, as normally peaceful beings are driven mad by darkness. The hero's investigations of these incidents takes him to the mainland of Klantol, where he uncovers a plot by the Chaos Knights to conquer the world. Meanwhile, Princess Camille sneaks away to find Gillespie and manages to learn the password to the Chaos Knights' hidden stronghold. She is later trapped in Koldazhek Cave, but is rescued by the hero and tells him the password. Infiltrating the Chaos Knights' stronghold, the hero slays both Gillespie and Deatharte, who had become leader of the Chaos Knights. The defeat of the Chaos Knights, however, causes a violent shift in balance from darkness to light, awakening a destructive power called Chaos, which even the forces of darkness fear. Marcel, Yvonne, Camille, and the court wizard are spirited away by Chaos. A former knight guides the hero to a passage to Chaos's realm. The hero goes there and defeats Chaos, rescuing the four prisoners and restoring balance to the world. Reception Shining Soul II received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. The earliest reviews came from Electronic Gaming Monthly (nearly four months prior to the game's release), Game Informer (nearly three months prior), and Nintendo Power (nearly two months prior).

Green for Warner Bros., starring Barbara Stanwyck as Lily Powers, and featuring George Brent. Based on a story by Darryl F. Zanuck (under the pseudonym Mark Canfield), Baby Face is about an attractive young woman who uses sex to advance her social and financial status. Twenty-five-year-old John Wayne plays a supporting role as one of Powers' lovers. Marketed with the salacious tagline \\"She had it and made it pay\\",‚ÄúIt‚Äù refers to the idea of indefinable but powerful sex appeal publicized by Elinor Glyn in her famous‚Äîand, at the time, infamous‚Äî book, It. Glyn adapted her novel for the screen, for the 1927 film of the same name starring Clara Bow, who thereafter was known as ‚Äúthe It girl‚Äù. the film's open discussion of sex made it one of the most notorious films of the Pre-Code Hollywood eraTuran, Kenneth (2004) Never Coming to a Theater Near You: A Celebration of a Certain Kind of Movie. Public Affairs . p.375 and helped bring the era to a close as enforcement of the code became stricter beginning in 1934. Mark A. Vieira, author of Sin in Soft Focus: Pre- Code Hollywood has said, \\"Baby Face was certainly one of the top 10 films that caused the Production Code to be enforced.\\" In 2005, Baby Face was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Plot Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) works for her father Nick (Robert Barrat) in a speakeasy in Erie, Pennsylvania during Prohibition. Since the age of 14, her father has had her sleep with many of his customers. The only man she trusts is Cragg (Alphonse Ethier ), a cobbler who admires Friedrich Nietzsche and advises her to aspire to greater things. Lily's father is killed when his still explodes. Cragg tells Lily to move to a big city and use her power over men. She and her African-American co-worker and best friend Chico (Theresa Harris) hop a freight train to New York City, but are discovered by a railroad worker who threatens to have them thrown in jail. As she unbuttons her blouse she says \\"Wait ... can't we talk this over?\\" It is strongly implied that she has sex with him to change his mind. In New York, Lily goes inside the Gotham Trust building. She seduces the personnel worker to land a job. Her subsequent rise through the building symbolizes her progress in sleeping her way to the top. In the filing department, Lily begins an affair with Jimmy McCoy Jr. (John Wayne), who recommends her for promotion to his boss, Brody (Douglass Dumbrille). She seduces Brody and is transferred to the mortgage department. Brody and Lily are caught in flagrante delicto by a rising young executive, Ned Stevens (Donald Cook). Brody is fired, but Lily claims Brody forced himself on her. Ned believes her and gives her a position in his accounting department. Although Ned is engaged to Ann Carter (Margaret Lindsay), the daughter of First Vice President J. P. Carter (Henry Kolker), Lily quickly seduces him. When Ann calls to say she will be visiting, Lily arranges to have Ann see her embracing Ned. Ann runs crying to her father, who tells Ned to fire Lily. He refuses, so J. P. calls Lily to his office to fire her himself. Lily claims she had no idea Ned was engaged and that he was her first boyfriend. She seduces J. P., and he installs her in a lavish apartment, with Chico as her maid. Ned tracks her down on Christmas Day, but she spurns him. He later returns to her apartment to ask her to marry him, but finds J. P. there. He shoots and kills J. P., then himself. Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), the grandson of Gotham Trust's founder and a notorious playboy, is elected bank president to handle the resulting scandal. The board of directors, learning that Lily has agreed to sell her diary to the press for $10,000, summons her to a meeting. She tells them she is a victim of circumstance who merely wants to make an honest living. The board offers her $15,000 to withhold her diary, but Courtland, seeing through her and using her claim that she simply wants to restart her life, instead offers her a position at the bank's Paris office. She reluctantly accepts. She also changes her name. When Courtland travels to Paris on business, he is surprised and impressed to find Lily not only still working there, but promoted to head of the travel bureau. He soon falls under her spell and marries her. Unlike her previous conquests, Courtland knows what she is, but admires her spirit nonetheless. While on their honeymoon, he is called back to New York. The bank has failed due to mismanagement, which the board unfairly pins on Courtland. He is indicted, and tells Lily he must raise a million dollars to finance his defense. He asks her to cash in the bonds, stocks and other valuables he gave her, but she refuses and books passage back to Paris. While waiting for the ship to leave, she changes her mind and rushes back to their apartment. When she arrives, she discovers Courtland has shot himself. She tearfully professes her love for him. On the way to the hospital, the ambulance attendant assures her that he has a good chance. Lily accidentally drops her jewelry case, spilling money and jewels on the floor. When the attendant points this out, she tearfully tells him they do not matter anymore. Courtland opens his eyes, sees Lily, and smiles at her.

Production head Darryl F. Zanuck wrote the treatment for the film and sold it to Warner Bros. for a dollar. The Great Depression was having a devastating effect on the film industry at the time, and many studio personnel were voluntarily taking salary cuts to help. Zanuck did not need the money because he was drawing a weekly salary of $3,500. He later left Warner Bros. and became the head of production at 20th Century Fox. Aside from its depiction of a seductress, the film is notable for the \\"comradely\\" relationship Lily has with African-American Chico, who is her co-worker in Erie, Pennsylvania, and comes with her to New York City. She later becomes Stanwyck's maid, but their relationship remains friendly, and not that of a mistress and her servant. At one point in the film, one of her lovers urges her to \\"send away that incredible colored woman\\", to which Stanwyck responds, with finality, \\"She stays.\\" Stanwyck had influence on the film's script. It was her suggestion that Lily had been forced by her father to sleep with the customers of his speakeasy. Baby Face was shot in 18 days, and cost $187,000. A publicity still from this film aptly shows Barbara Stanwyck posing next to a stepladder,Sin in Soft Focus, p.157 representing Lily's step-by-step up the ladder of success, as she seduces one man after another. =Music= An instrumental version of the 1926 hit song \\"Baby Face\\", composed by Harry Akst, is played over the opening credits and in later scenes. \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" by W. C. Handy is also used repeatedly. Theresa Harris (\\"Chico\\") sings it twice and an instrumental version is heard at the close of the final scene. Censorship After its initial limited release, the Hays Office recommended that the film be pulled from distribution entirely because of multiple violations of the Production Code. Extensive correspondence took place between Zanuck and Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. and the Association of Motion Picture Producers (AMPP) about ways to make the film more acceptable to state and city censors. The primary change was to alter the ending to one which showed Lily losing everything and returning to her roots in her home town, where she is content to live a modest lifestyle, thus showing the audience that her sexual vices were not ultimately rewarded. Also, Lily's status as a \\"kept woman\\" was made less obvious, and the scene where she seduces a railroad worker in a boxcar, while her friend Chico is on the other side of the car, singing \\"Saint Louis Blues\\", was cut. Another significant change was that the cobbler's enthusiasm for Nietzschean philosophy was replaced by his becoming the moral voice of the film, showing that Lily had been wrong to use her body to succeed. The cobbler's original speech was:Sin in Soft Focus, pp.148-49 The altered version, with the cobbler as the voice of morality, was: The new lines were dubbed onto an over-the-shoulder shot of the cobbler. The New York State Censorship Board rejected the film's original version in April 1933, and Warners made the changes described above, as well as cutting some sexually suggestive shots. In June 1933 the Board passed the revised version, which then had a successful release.Kehr, Dave (January 9, 2005) \\"A Wanton Woman's Ways Revealed, 71 Years Later\\", The New York Times The film was also initially rejected by the censorship board in Virginia. The uncensored version remained lost until 2004, when it resurfaced at a Library of Congress film vault in Dayton, Ohio. George Willeman is credited with the discovery. The restored version premiered at the London Film Festival in November 2004. In 2005 it was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film RegistryStaff (December 20, 2005) \\"Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry\\" (press release) Library of Congress and also was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 best movies of the last 80 years. Turner Classic Movies shows the uncensored version. Reception=Box office= According to Warner Bros the film earned $308,000 domestically and $144,000 foreign. =Critical response= Reviews contemporary with the film's release were not positive. Mordaunt Hall in The New York Times panned the film, calling it \\"an unsavory subject, with incidents set forth in an inexpert fashion,\\" while a review in The New York Evening Post said \\"You cannot escape the belief that Lily is a vixen of the lowest order and that the men who play with her are doomed to perish in the flames.\\" See also * Pre-Code sex films * List of rediscovered films References Notes Bibliography * Doherty, Thomas Patrick (1999) Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema 1930‚Äì1934.

It is named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967. His original wording was: The law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming. In colloquial terms, it means software or automated systems end up \\"shaped like\\" the organizational structure they are designed in or designed for. Some interpretations of the law say this organizational pattern mirroring is a helpful feature of such systems, while other interpretations say it's merely a result of human nature or organizational bias. Variations Eric S. Raymond, an open-source advocate, restated Conway's law in The New Hacker's Dictionary, a reference work based on the Jargon File. The organization of the software and the organization of the software team will be congruent, he said. Summarizing an example in Conway's paper, Raymond wrote: Raymond further presents Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law, stated as: Yourdon and Constantine, in their 1979 book on Structured Design, gave a more strongly stated variation of Conway's Law: James O. Coplien and Neil B. Harrison stated in a 2004 book concerned with organizational patterns of Agile software development: Supporting evidence An example of the impact of Conway's Law can be found in the design of some organization websites. Nigel Bevan stated in a 1997 paper, regarding usability issues in websites: \\"Organisations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organisation rather than the needs of the users of the site.\\" Evidence in support of Conway's law has been published by a team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Business School researchers who, using \\"the mirroring hypothesis\\" as an equivalent term for Conway's law, found \\"strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis\\", and that the \\"product developed by the loosely-coupled organization is significantly more modular than the product from the tightly-coupled organization\\". The authors highlight the impact of \\"organizational design decisions on the technical structure of the artifacts that these organizations subsequently develop\\". Additional and likewise supportive case studies of Conway's law have been conducted by Nagappan, Murphy and Basili at the University of Maryland in collaboration with Microsoft, and by Syeed and Hammouda at Tampere University of Technology in Finland.

When a patient becomes unconscious, the muscles in the jaw commonly relax and can allow the tongue to slide back and obstruct the airway. This makes airway management necessary, and an NPA is one of the available tools. The purpose of the flared end is to prevent the device from becoming lost inside the patient's nose.  Sizes  As with other catheters, NPAs are measured using the French catheter scale, but sizes are usually also quoted in millimeters. Typical sizes include: 6.5 mm/28FR, 7.0 mm/30FR, 7.5 mm/32FR, 8.0 mm/34FR, and 8.5 mm/36FR.  Indications and contraindications  These devices are used by emergency care professionals such as EMTs and paramedics in situations where an artificial form of airway maintenance is necessary, but tracheal intubation is impossible, inadvisable, or outside the practitioner's scope of practice. An NPA is often used in conscious patients where an oropharyngeal airway would trigger the gag reflex. They are contraindicated in patients with severe facial trauma, as they may have an altered facial anatomy (particularly concerning the nasal passageways) and inserting an NPA may cause additional harm to the patient.  Insertion  The correct size airway is chosen by measuring the device on the patient: the device should reach from the patient's nostril to the earlobe or the angle of the jaw.Daniel Limmer and Michael F. O'Keefe. 2005. Emergency Care 10th ed. Edward T. Dickinson, Ed. Pearson, Prentice Hall. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Page 147. The outside of the tube is lubricated with a water-based lubricant so that it enters the nose more easily. The device is inserted until the flared end rests against the nostril.

Apart from the above, Conway is perhaps most famous for developing the concept of coroutines. Conway coined the term coroutine in 1958 and he was the first to apply the concept to an assembly program. He later authored a seminal paper on the subject of coroutines, titled \\"Design of a Separable Transition-diagram Compiler\\", which included the first published explanation of the concept. In this paper, he proposed organizing a compiler as a set of coroutines, which allows using separate passes while debugging and then running a single pass compiler in production. Another famous paper is his 1958 proposal of an UNCOL, a Universal Computer Oriented Language, which attempted to provide a solution to economically produce compilers for new programming languages and computer architectures. Conway wrote an assembler for the Burroughs model 220 computer called SAVE. The name SAVE was not an acronym, but a feature: programmers lost fewer punched card decks because they all had \\"SAVE\\" written on them. His work on Pascal compiler for Rockwell Semiconductor (an immediate-turnaround Pascal trainer for the Rockwell AIM-65) led to an arrangement between Apple and Think Technologies (where he served as a principal) under which the latter produced the original (1984) Mac Pascal and Apple II Instant Pascal. In the 1970s, he was involved with the MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi- Programming System) medical programming language standard specification for the National Bureau of Standards. He also wrote a reference book on MUMPS in 1983. Conway was granted a US patent in 2001 on \\"Dataflow processing with events\\", concerned with programming using graphical user interfaces. The patent expired in 2019. In 2002 Conway obtained a teacher license for high school math and physics in Massachusetts. He taught at Chelsea High School until 2006.

The neighborhood caters to wholesale selling and has more than 4,000 overwhelmingly independently owned and operated retail and wholesale businesses selling apparel, footwear, accessories, and fabrics. Status and boundaries The Fashion District has no official, government-recognized status. It is recognized as a subdistrict of Downtown by the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council (DLANC),https://dlanc.com/boundary-map/https://fashiondistrict.org Los Angeles Fashion District which states its boundaries as: *to the west, Main Street *to the south, Washington Blvd. (west of Alameda Street) and 26th St. (east of Alameda St.) *to the east, the Los Angeles River (DLANC definition) or by the Fashion District's definition, Paloma Street, three blocks east of San Pedro Street.https://fashiondistrict.org/_files/docs/lafd_map_final_expansion-- forprint.pdf *to the north, generally 7th St. and Skid Row and the Arts District In earlier documents, the DLANC defined the eastern parts of what it now terms the Fashion District as the Warehouse District, Produce District, and Southern Industrial District.\\"Vision Downtown\\", Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council, sources dated 2012-3 History The identification of a \\"garment district\\" is relatively new in Los Angeles' history as a large city. In 1972 the Los Angeles Times defined the L.A. Garment District as being along Los Angeles Street from 3rd to 11th Street, an area that today straddles the border of Skid Row and the very northwest end of the current Fashion District. At the time, the newspaper stated that 2,000 garment manufacturers were located in that area, which was \\"virtually unknown to most Los Angeles residents\\". By 1982 the district was a roughly 20 block area from Maple to Main and 7th to 12th streets and had become a popular place for Angelenos to seek fashions at cheaper prices. There were about 500 retail outlets, and key destinations for shoppers included the Cooper Building, the Fashion Center Building and \\"The Alley\\", now known as Santee Alley. On January 2, 1996 the Garment District formally began changing the area‚Äôs name and image to the Los Angeles Fashion District through one of the City‚Äôs first BIDs (Business Improvement District). At the time the Fashion District was composed of 56 blocks and since then, has nearly doubled the definition of its size to the current 107 blocks. Workers are mostly Latin American and Asian immigrants.https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9rp5p8d3 BID organization The LA Fashion District BID states that it \\"has pioneered a collaborative effort among area stakeholders that continues to foster a clean, safe, and vibrant environment for everyone who experiences the district.

It is the only such facility in the US, and is among nine worldwide. The lab is supported by the National Science Foundation and the state of Florida, and works in collaboration with private industry. Currently the lab holds a world record of possessing the world's strongest magnet for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. The 33-ton series connected hybrid (SCH) magnet broke the record during a series of tests conducted by MagLab engineers and scientists. The instrument reached its full field of 36 Tesla on 15 November 2016. History=Proposal and award= In 1989 Florida State University (FSU), Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a new national laboratory supporting interdisciplinary research in high magnetic fields. The plan proposed a federal-state partnership serving magnet-related research, science and technology education, and partnering industry. The goal was to maintain the competitive position of the US in magnet-related research and development. Following a peer-review competition, the NSF approved the FSU-led consortium's proposal. =Competing proposal by MIT= In a competing proposal to the NSF, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the University of Iowa, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Argonne National Laboratory, had suggested improving the existing world-class Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory at MIT. On September 5, 1990, MIT researchers asked the 21 members of the National Science Board (NSB) to \\"review and reconsider\\" its decision. With $60 million at stake in the NSF grant, MIT stated it would phase out the Francis Bitter Lab if it lost its appeal, the first of its kind in NSF history. The request was turned down September 18, 1990. =Early years= The laboratory's early years were spent establishing infrastructure, building the facility, and recruiting faculty. The Tallahassee complex was dedicated on October 1, 1994, to a large crowd, with keynote speaker Vice President Al Gore. Mission The lab's mission, as set forth by the NSF, is: \\"To provide the highest magnetic fields and necessary services for scientific research conducted by users from a wide range of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, biology and geology.\\" The lab focuses on four objectives: * Develop user facilities and services for magnet-related research, open to all qualified scientists and engineers * Advance magnet technology in cooperation with industry * Promote a multidisciplinary research environment and administer in-house research program that uses and advances the facilities * Develop an educational outreach program =Education and Public Outreach= The National MagLab promotes science education and supports science, engineering, and science teachers through its Center for Integrating Research and Learning. Programs include mentorships in an interdisciplinary learning environment. Through the Magnet Academy,Magnet Academy the lab's website provides educational content on electricity and magnetism. The National MagLab also conducts monthly tours open to the public, and hosts an annual open house with about 5,000 attendees. Special tour and outreach opportunities are also available to local schools. In an interview on Skepticality, Dr. Scott Hannahs said, \\"If you come by on the third Saturday in February I believe we have an open house and we have Tesla coils shooting sparks and we melt rocks in the geochemistry group and we measure the speed of sound and we have lasers and potato launchers and we just have all sorts of things showing little scientific principles and stuff. We get together and we have about 5,000 people show up to come and tour a physics lab which is a pretty amazing group of people.\\" Programs Diagram of the 45 Tesla hybrid magnet =Florida State University programs= The Tallahassee laboratory at Florida State University is a 34,374 square meter (370,000 sq ft.) complex and has approximately 300 faculty, staff, graduate, and postdoctoral students. Its director is physicist Gregory Scott Boebinger. Its chief scientist is Laura Greene. DC field program The facility contains 14 resistive magnet cells connected to a 48 megawatt DC power supply and of cooling equipment to remove the heat generated by the magnets. The facility houses several magnets, including a 45 Tesla hybrid magnet, which combines resistive and superconducting magnets. The lab's 41.4 Tesla resistive magnet is the strongest DC (continuous-field) resistive magnet in the world, and the 25 Tesla Keck magnet has the highest homogeneity of any resistive magnet. NMR spectroscopy and imaging This program serves a broad user base in solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy and MRI and diffusion measurements at high magnetic field strengths. The lab develops technology, methodology, and applications at high magnetic fields through both in-house and external user activities. An in-house made 900 MHz (21.1 Tesla) NMR magnet has an ultra-wide bore measuring 105 mm (about 4 inches) in diameter, this superconducting magnet has the highest field for MRI study of a living animals. Ion cyclotron resonance The Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry program is involved in instrument and technique development and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Under the leadership of director Alan G. Marshall, the program continuously develops techniques and instruments and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The program has several instruments, including a 14.5 Tesla, 104 mm bore system. Electron magnetic resonance The most common form of EMR is electron paramagnetic/spin resonance (EPR/ESR). In EPR experiments, transitions are observed between the mS sublevels of an electronic spin state S that are split by the applied magnetic field as well as by the fine structure interactions and the electron- nuclear hyperfine interactions. This technique has applications in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics and materials research. Magnet science and technology The Magnet Science and Technology division is charged with developing the technology and expertise for magnet systems. These magnet projects include building advanced magnet systems for the Tallahassee and Los Alamos sites, working with industry to develop the technology to improve high- field magnet manufacturing capabilities, and improving high field magnet systems through research and development. Also at the lab's FSU headquarters, the Applied Superconductivity Center advances the science and technology of superconductivity for both the low temperature niobium-based and the high temperature cuprate or MgB2-based materials. The ASC pursues the superconductors for magnets for fusion, high energy physics, MRI, and electric power transmission lines and transformers. In-house research The in- house research program utilizes MagLab facilities to pursue high field research in science and engineering, while advancing the lab‚Äôs user programs through development of new techniques and equipment. =Condensed matter group= The condensed matter group scientists concentrate on various aspects of condensed matter physics, including studies and experiments involving magnetism, the quantum hall effect, quantum oscillations, high temperature superconductivity, and heavy fermion systems. =Geochemistry Program= The geochemistry research program is centered around the use of trace elements and isotopes to understand the Earth processes and environment. The research interests range from the chemical evolution of Earth and solar system through time to local scale problems on the sources and transport of environmentally significant substances. The studies conducted by the geochemistry division concern terrestrial and extraterrestrial questions and involve land-based and seagoing expeditions and spacecraft missions. Together with FSU's Chemistry and Oceanography departments, Geochemistry has started a program in Biogeochemical Dynamics. =Other programs= Other programs include cryogenics, optical microscopy, quantum materials and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The lab also has a materials research team that researches new ways to make high strength magnetic materials using more common and cheaper elements. =Los Alamos National Laboratory Pulsed Field Facility= Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico hosts the Pulsed Field Facility, which provides researchers with experimental capabilities for a wide range of measurements in non-destructive pulsed fields to 60 Tesla. Pulsed field magnets create high magnetic fields, but only for fractions of a second. A 100 Tesla multi-shot magnet is being jointly constructed by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. The laboratory is located at the center of Los Alamos. In 1999-2000, the facility was relocated into a new specially designed Experimental Hall to better accommodate user operations and support. The program is the first and only high pulsed field user facility in the United States. The facility provides a wide variety of experimental capabilities to 60 Tesla, using short and long pulse magnets. Power comes from a pulsed power infrastructure which includes a 1.43 gigawatt motor generator and five 64-megawatt power supplies. The 1200-ton motor generator sits on a 4800-short ton (4350 t) inertia block which rests on 60 springs to minimize earth tremors and is the centerpiece of the Pulsed Field Laboratory. The facility's magnets include a 60 Tesla long-pulse magnet that is the most powerful controlled-pulse magnet in the world. =University of Florida Programs= The University of Florida is home to user facilities in magnetic resonance imaging or (MRI) with an ultra-low temperature, ultra-quiet environment for experimental studies in the High B/T (high magnetic field/low temperature) Facility. Facilities are also available for the fabrication and characterization of nanostructures at a new nanoscale research facility operated in conjunction with the university's Major Analytical and Instrumentation Center. High B/T Facility The High B/T Facility is part of the Microkelvin Laboratory of the Physics Department and conducts experiments in high magnetic fields up to 15.2 Teslas and at temperatures as low as 0.4 mK simultaneously for studies of magnetization, thermodynamic quantities, transport measurements, magnetic resonance, viscosity, diffusion, and pressure. The facility holds world records for high B/T in Bay 1 for short term low field capabilities and world records for high field long time (> 1 week) experiments. The research group leads the world in collective studies of quantum fluids and solids in terms of breadth and low temperature techniques (thermometry, NMR, ultrasound, heat capacity, sample cooling.) Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy The Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy program contains facilities for the Mag Lab's NMR Program that complement the facilities at the lab's headquarters in Tallahassee. The program is located at the University of Florida's McKnight Brain Institute. Their instruments include a 600 MHz NMR magnet with 1 mm triple-resonance, high-temperature superconducting probe, which delivers the highest mass sensitivity of any probe at any frequency in the world.

Each player chooses one of the major powers from the 1950s/1960s era and controlled their economic and military buildup during each turn, much like Risk.  Board  The board is an azimuthal projected map of the Earth looking down at the North Pole. Each of the six playable \\"countries\\" are different bright colors while unplayable regions are various shades of brown depending on their economic and military \\"value\\". The six countries and their colors are: United States (Blue), Soviet Union (Red), China (Yellow), India (Green), Western Europe (Purple), and South America (Orange), Each of the player countries are worth 10 points, while the brown regions vary from 2, 4, 6, and 8.  Pieces  For the board is a small circlet holder with colored flags to remind players which countries are in alliance. This piece is largely viewed as a gimmick, though various house rules may have different uses for these pieces. Each player may build, in their captured regions, a balance of factories, mills (both square), and military bases (round). Each player is awarded every turn a number of I-Beams, red Military Threat chips, white Popular Support chips, and black Economic Pressure chips. The I-Beams are produced by a player's Mills and are used to build more Factories, Bases, and Mills. Economic Pressure chips come from the amount of Mills a player owns. Popular Support chips come from the number of Factories one owns. Military Threat chips come from the number of Bases one has. There is also a set of cards with various situations that players must respond to. They can be as simple as gaining two I-Beams, to losing three red chips. The cards are similar to the community chest and chance cards of Monopoly.  Strategy  Allies are welcomed and may help struggling players get out of trouble, or create an unbeatable force that will crush the remaining weak players. Eventually though everyone must defeat their opponents to win the game. The game calls for a balance of social skills, economic knowledge, and military tactics.  Premonition of the Cuban Missile Crisis  One of the primary strategies of the game is to threaten an invasion by deploying one's military and economic power cards unless an opposing player dismantles their bases in one of the brown regions. This scenario came true one year after the game was released in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 when U.S. President John F. Kennedy demanded that the Soviet Union dismantle its bases in Cuba and the world came close to the brink of nuclear war. After the crisis was over, sales of the game shot up.

The Institute's areas of interest include Parkinson's disease, stroke, motor neurone disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, addiction, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain development in premature babies, Huntington's disease, depression, schizophrenia, brain function in health and disease, heart failure, and dementia. Affiliated with the University of Melbourne and the Austin Hospital, the Institute is located in the Melbourne suburbs of and in Victoria. It is the largest brain research group in the southern hemisphere and employs approximately 600 staff and students. The Institute is led by its Director, Professor Steven Petrou, who specialises in the underlying electrophysiological basis of genetic childhood epilepsies. History The origins of the institute are based on the 1947 work of the founder, Dr. Derek Denton, and the investigation of the team of scientists, Prof R D Wright, Prof J P Coghlan and Prof Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan into the control of salt and water balance in health and disease. The Institute was formally established in 1971 by the Victorian Government and named in honour of Howard Florey, an Australian Laureate of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine who helped to isolate the active principle of penicillin and developed the first manufacturing process for the antibiotic. The Institute conducted research into physiological control of body fluid and electrolyte balance, especially the regulation of the adrenal salt-retaining hormone, aldosterone; micro measurement of hormones; hybridization histochemistry; instincts that control ingestion; and the Relaxin hormone. Previously known as the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, in 1997 the Institute‚Äôs focus broadened to encompass brain disorders. From 1997 to 2007, the neuroscientist Professor Frederick Mendelsohn AO, led the institute. On 1 July 2007 the legislation that created the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine was repealed, and the Florey amalgamated with the Brain Research Institute and the National Stroke Research Institute to become collectively known as the Florey Neuroscience Institutes (FNI). As part of the amalgamation process, a new research facility was constructed to house the FNI, the Mental Health Research Institute and researchers from the University of Melbourne. In 2012, with the amalgamation of the Mental Health Research Institute and the Florey Neuroscience Institutes, the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health was formed. Research now includes psychiatric conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and on neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

The school now also has an auditorium, a teaching theater, dance rooms, technology rooms, a piano lab, a choir/band hall, and a library with computers where the students can do research. It also has a two-story parking garage, an auto shop, and large track and field. In 2012 Richard Connelly of the Houston Press ranked Reagan as the sixth most architecturally beautiful high school campus in Greater Houston.

A. Cotton, G. Wilkinson, Interscience, 2d Edition, 1966 The term is usually applied to solid ionic compounds that contain the oxide anion O2‚àí and two or more element cations. Typical examples are ilmenite (FeTiO3), a mixed oxide of iron (Fe2+) and titanium (Ti4+) cations, perovskite and garnet. The cations may be the same element in different ionization states: a notable example is magnetite Fe3O4, which contains the cations Fe2+ (\\"ferrous\\" iron) and Fe3+ (\\"ferric\\" iron) in 1:2 ratio. Other notable examples include red lead , the ferrites,Alex Goldman (1990), Modern ferrite technology and the yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12,K. Byrappa, Masahiro Yoshimura (2001), Handbook of hydrothermal technology. William Andrew. 870 pages. used in lasers. The term is sometimes also applied to compounds of oxygen and two or more other elements, where some or all of the oxygen atoms are covalently bound into oxoanions. In sodium zincate , for example, the oxygens are bound to the zinc atoms forming zincate anionss.D. Trinschek, M. Jansen (1996): \\"Na2ZnO2, ein neues Natriumzinkat\\".

Prior to the Consumer Credit Act, legislation covering consumer credit was slapdash and focused on particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and hire-purchase agreements. Following the report of the Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by a general election, the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974. The Act introduces new protection for consumers and new regulation for bodies trading in consumer credit and related industries. Such traders must have full licenses from the Office of Fair Trading, which may be suspended or revoked in the event of irregularities. The Act also regulates what may be taken as security, limits the ways in which credit organisations can advertise and gives the County Court the ability to intercede in the case of unfair or unjust credit agreements. It also gives additional rights to the debtor, including certain limited rights to cancel concluded agreements. The Act was amended by the Consumer Credit Act 2006. Background=Early evolution of consumer protection= Consumer credit regulation was ignored by both Parliament and the courts for over 800 years, with the judges and Members of Parliament taking the attitude that there was no reason to interfere with fairly concluded contracts. The first piece of legislation to deal with consumer credit was the Bills of Sale Act 1854, which required bills of sale to be registered. This allowed the courts to intervene for the first time, since an unregistered bill of sale was void and could not be claimed by creditors.Goode (1979) p.1 This act was followed by the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882, which provided limited protection for debtors. Outside of these acts, however, little was done between 1854 and 1900, and moneylenders used this to their advantage, sometimes abusively; the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Money-Lending in 1898 included testimony from one moneylender who admitted he charged 3,000% interest, while another had worked under 34 different aliases to avoid having notoriety associated with his name.Goode (1979) p.3 As a result of this report the Moneylenders Act 1900 was passed, which required registration for moneylenders and allowed the courts to dissolve \\"unfair\\" moneylending agreements. This act had two main weaknesses, however; firstly, many of the debtors who would like to sue their moneylender to have the agreement cancelled were by definition poor, and could not afford legal representation. Secondly, the Act only focused on specific types of lenders; lending by a single moneylender was covered, lending by a bank was not. In 1927 a second Moneylenders Act was passed, which required licensing as well as registration and forbade moneylenders from employing agents, canvasses or sending out unsolicited advertisements. Unfortunately the 1900 and 1927 Acts also covered commercial transactions, and since people lending money in a commercial area were not excluded as banks were, a slight infraction could make a loan completely irrecoverable. This was partially solved with the passing of the Companies Act 1967, which allowed the Board of Trade to give individual moneylenders licenses saying that they were acting as banks, not moneylenders.Goode (1979) p.4 As a result of the restrictions on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of hire-purchase developed. These were first regulated by the Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932, which only covered Scotland; England and Wales was first covered by the Hire-Purchase Act 1938, later amended by the Hire-Purchase Act 1954 and the Hire-Purchase Act 1964. The 1965 Act applied to all hire-purchase agreements worth less than ¬£2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.Goode (1979) p.8 =Crowther Committee= In 1965 the Crowther Committee was established to look at the state of consumer credit law in the United Kingdom.Keenan (2005) p.420 Chaired by Lord Crowther, the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971.Goode (1979) p.5 The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending.Goode (1979) p.6 Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a Consumer Sale and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use. The reaction to the report from consumer and business organisations was overwhelmingly positive, but the government initially did nothing, since the Department of Trade and Industry wanted time to work out the particular details of any Acts. Their hand was eventually forced by Baroness Phillips a year later, who initiated a debate in the House of Lords on the matter. The government's official statement was that they were willing to accept almost all the recommendations made about consumer credit, they did not wish to legislate on lending and securities. In February 1973 they created a voluntary code which they expected those lending to observe. The code set out guidelines for loaning money to individuals and disclosing the cost of the loan. In September 1973 the government issued a white paper titled Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit in which they indicated they were planning to implement almost all of the Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from ¬£2,000 to ¬£5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under hire-purchase agreements.Goode (1979) p.9 Formation of the Act The Act was first introduced to Parliament as the Consumer Credit Bill at the beginning of November 1973, and initially ran to 96 pages. It was given its second reading on 14 November, and was welcomed by both the government and opposition. By February 1974 it had passed through the Committee Stage, but its progress was cut short by a general election in the same month. Thanks to the support of the opposition to the original bill this did not make a significant impact, and the new administration immediately reintroduced the bill in the House of Lords. It was passed on 31 July 1974, and immediately received the Royal Assent.Goode (1979) p.10 The final version of the act contained 193 sections and 5 schedules, much larger than the original 96 pages.Goode (1979) p.37 Provisions of the Act The Act is divided into 12 sections, and is \\"designed to provide a comprehensive code regulating the consumer credit and consumer hire fgb and almost every aspect of a credit granting operation\\".Goode (1979) p.38 =Part I: Director General of Fair Trading= The office of Director General of Fair Trading was created by the Fair Trading Act 1973, with the Director appointed by the government for a five-year term. Consumer credit was not originally part of his duties (although the scope of his role did contain some elements of consumer credit) and the Crowther Committee had recommended the creation of a separate Consumer Credit Commissioner, something included in the original bill. When the bill was resurrected after the February 1974 general election, however, it was decided that the duties should instead be given to the Office of Fair Trading, and for this purpose a separate division (the Division of Consumer Credit) was set up within the OFT.Goode (1979) p.42 Section 1 of the Act gives the Director General of Fair Trading the duties of administering the licensing system set up by the Act, supervising the working and enforcement of the Act and any regulations made by it and, if appropriate, enforce the Act and regulations himself. The DGFT is also tasked with advising the government about social and commercial developments within the United Kingdom, and any actions taken to enforce the Act and its orders and regulations. Section 4 of the act requires him to disseminate any appropriate information and advice about consumer credit to the people of the United Kingdom. This allows him to educate the public about consumer credit, and was intended to be conducted through organisations such as the Citizens Advice Bureau. The Director's duties under this Act overlap slightly with those given by the Fair Trading Act, but are still an expansion over his original role.Goode (1979) p.43 The Director General is tasked with issuing licenses, and under Section 35 of the Act, the Director is required to maintain a register containing all appropriate information related to licenses and applications for licenses. The register was created on 2 February 1976, and is kept at Chancery House in London.Goode (1979) p.47 The Enterprise Act 2002 formally substituted the Office of Fair Trading for the Director General of Fair Trading for the purposes of this Act.Enterprise Act 2002 S.278-9 =Part II: Credit agreements, hire agreements and linked transactions= Part II contains definitions for many types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit agreements, regulated consumer hire agreements and partially regulated agreements. Regulated agreements A regulated consumer credit agreement is defined as an agreement between two parties, one of whom (the debtor) is an individual, and the other of whom (the creditor) is \\"any other person\\", in which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not exceeding ¬£5,000 (this figure was subsequently increased to ¬£25,000 and under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 there is no upper limit). An exception to this definition is so-called \\"exempt agreements\\", which are agreements made where the creditor is a land improvement company, a charity, a friendly society, a trade union, an insurance company or \\"a body corporate named or specifically referred to in any public general Act\\".Consumer Credit Act 1974 S.16(1) The definition of \\"agreement\\" is given as any discussion which produces a legal relationship; a contract. As such the decision of courts as to whether an agreement constituted an \\"agreement\\" under the Act rests with English contract law, and is not discussed within the Act. In many cases this is largely academic, however, since unless one party tries to contest the existence of a contract any agreement can proceed regardless of its validity under contract law.Goode (1979) p.53 \\"Individual\\" is defined as including a partnership or other unincorporated body, but not corporations registered at Companies House or created by an Act of Parliament or Royal Charter, such as the BBC. The definition also excludes \\"corporations sole\\", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, industrial and provident societies are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of \\"person\\" includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.Goode (1979) p.55 A regulated consumer hire agreement is defined as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase.Goode (1979) p.56 The agreement must be \\"capable of subsisting\\" for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than ¬£5,000 total and not be an \\"exempt agreement\\". \\"Goods\\" are defined as chattels personal, with \\"capable of subsisting\\" simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement does not have to exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.Goode (1979) p.57 Partially regulated agreements Partially regulated agreements are those consumer hire or consumer credit agreements which are not an exempt agreement but are exempt from certain provisions of the Act. What these provisions are depends on the type of agreement; small agreements, non-commercial agreements and contracts with a foreign element. Small agreements are defined in Section 17 of the act as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed ¬£30 and regulated consumer hire agreements which do not require the hirer to pay more than ¬£30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under ¬£30 to avoid regulation.Goode (1979) p.58 Small agreements are exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.Goode (1979) p.59 The Act is primarily aimed at commercial and professional traders, and as a result excludes non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements are defined by the Act as agreements where neither the creditor nor debtor are providing the transaction for business purposes in any way. Non-commercial agreements are exempt from Part V of the Act.Goode (1979) p.60 Contracts with a foreign element would not normally be mentioned in Acts of Parliament, which are deliberately constructed to avoid giving the law extraterritorial effect. In this case, however, the Act contains provisions for contracts with a foreign element, which due to the nature of commerce are common (a credit card issued in the United Kingdom, for example, which is used on holiday in France). As a result, Section 16(5) specifically excludes contracts \\"having a connection with a country outside the United Kingdom\\" from the Act.Goode (1979) p.62 =Part III: Licensing of credit and hire businesses= The previous Acts on commercial credit provided no mechanism to regulate and enforce the rules, and the Consumer Credit Act's licensing system was the first major regulatory process within British consumer credit law. Licenses are required to carry out a consumer credit or consumer hire business, with exceptions for local authorities and corporate bodies allowed by an Act of Parliament to carry out consumer credit business. All other bodies must apply to the Consumer Credit Licensing Branch of the Office of Fair Trading for a license.Goode (1979) p.106 Types of license There are two types of license given ‚Äì group licenses and standard licenses. Group licenses are issued by the Director General of Fair Trading to cover a group of people in those activities described in the license. Group licenses can be issued following an application, or simply voluntarily by the Director. Holders of a group license do not have to apply individually and are not vetted individually, and holding a group license does not prevent members from also applying for a standard license. The group licenses are intended for cases where individual screening is not in the public interest; for example, when bodies are so large and established that their reputation is without question and individual screening would take too much time. Bodies currently holding group licenses include the Law Society of England and Wales and the Law Society of Northern Ireland, both professional associations of solicitors. The Director has the ability to exclude named individuals from group licenses to prevent obvious abuse.Goode (1979) p.109 Standard licenses are licenses issued by the Director General to an individual. It can only be provided following an application, not at the Director General's discretion like a group license, and covers certain activities in a fixed period. Initially there was no obligation to issue licenses, but an amendment to the bill in Parliament means that the Director General is required to issue a license on the application of any person, providing that person is a fit person to engage in such activities and the name he applies to be licensed under is not misleading or undesirable. The license allows an individual or a partnership to trade under those names listed on the license, and is divided into seven categories: *Category A: Consumer credit business *Category B: Consumer hire business *Category C: Credit brokerage *Category D: Debt-adjusting and counselling *Category E: Debt-collecting *Category F: Credit reference agencies Holders of a license are obliged to inform the Director General when there is a change made within the office of a corporate licensee, an unincorporated body or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the Consumer Credit Bulletin, the weekly journal of the Office of Fair Trading. A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.Goode (1979) p.117 A license can be terminated on the death of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the Mental Health Act 1959, a bankruptcy deal under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders.Goode (1979) p.119 These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.Goode (1979) p.120 =Part IV: Seeking business= The Act specifically controls the way in which traders and companies seek business. Prior to this individual aspects had been controlled ‚Äî advertisement by moneylenders had been strictly regulated since the Moneylenders Act 1927 ‚Äî but no other aspects of consumer credit were regulated at all. While this was acceptable for large and respectable institutions, the evolution of less reputable trading organisations necessitated some kind of regulation, and the Consumer Credit Act was the first statute to provide such controls for consumer credit organisations. It covers three main areas: advertising, canvassing and quotations and the display of information. No regulations have yet been made on quotations or the display of information.Goode (1979) p.140 Advertising The advertising provisions apply to any advertisement published for the business carried out by the advertiser which indicates he is willing to provide credit or provide goods to be hired. \\"advertisement\\" is taken to mean any form of advertisement, including a publication, television or radio broadcast, the display of signs, labels or goods, the distribution of samples, circulars, catalogues or price lists or the exhibition of picture, models or films, or in \\"any other way\\". Previous legislation such as the Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1967 limited the definition of advertisement to visual advertisements and excluded oral communications and radio broadcasts, which are included by the Act. The test of whether an oral communication counts as an \\"advertisement\\" is whether or not the communication is made for drawing attention to the advertiser's business or for answering a specific enquiry without promoting the business. In R. v Delmayne [1970] 2 QB 170 the High Court of Justice decided that even replying to an enquiry can amount to an advertisement if framed in such a way that it is calculated to attract business.Goode (1979) p.141 Part IV only applies to \\"public\\" advertising published to promote a business ‚Äî as such circulars given to employees advertising such terms would not be considered \\"advertisements\\". Advertisements are not regulated by the Act if the advertiser is not involved in a consumer credit business, consumer hire business or a business in which he provides credit to individuals.Goode (1979) p.142 Under Part IV, the Secretary of State can make regulations limiting the form and content of advertisements covered by the Act. The regulations can also specifically include certain terms or facts, and failing to follow them constitutes an offence. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that no advertisement contains misleading information, that advertisements provide the reader with a \\"reasonable picture\\" of the terms and conditions and that the reader is aware that the availability and terms of credit may be affected by factors such as the age and employment of the applicant.Goode (1979) p.144 Canvassing The Crowther Committee recommended that doorstep canvassing for loans should be completely prohibited. The original provisions in the bill were indeed extremely stringent, and caused potential problems for other businesses, but were significantly amended and now only affect the canvassing they were intended to prevent. Canvassing is defined as a situation in which an individual (the canvasser) solicits the entry of another individual (the consumer) into an agreement based on his oral representations during a visit by the canvasser to \\"any place\\" for the purpose of making such representations. Exceptions to \\"any place\\" are places where business is carried out, either permanently or temporarily, by the creditor, owner, supplier, canvasser, employer of the canvasser or the consumer. There is no requirement that the oral solicitations take place in person - they can come over the telephone, or be trying to induce another individual to convince the consumer into entering an agreement.Goode (1979) p.147 =Part V: Entry into credit or hire agreements= Part V of the Act deals with four elements of entering into a credit or hire agreement; pre-contract disclosure, the formalities of entry into a regulated agreement, cancellation of a regulated agreement and its consequences and withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement and its consequences. In some cases, specific information must be disclosed before a contract is made, with the standard provision that contracts where this is not followed are unenforceable without an order from the courts.Goode (1979) p.181 Formalities There are certain formalities for entry into a regulated agreement, mostly based on the documentation that must be provided. Under Section 60, the Secretary of State is required to make certain regulations covering the format that contracts must take. These regulations must ensure that the debtor is made aware of the rights and/or duties conferred on him by the agreement, the amount and rate of the total charge for credit, the protection and remedies available to him and \\"any other matters which, in the opinion of the secretary of state, it is desirable for him to know about in connection with the agreement\\". The Act allows the Director General of Fair Trading to waive certain requirements if it appears, on the application of a consumer credit business, that to enforce them would be impracticable.Goode (1979) p.182 Section 61 lays out the formalities required for a regulated agreement. The terms must be found in a signed and legible document, a copy of the unsigned agreement must be supplied to the debtor or hirer, a copy of the signed document must be supplied to the debtor or hirer and a notice advising the debtor or hirer of his rights of cancellation must be included with the signed and unsigned copies. The \\"signed and legible document\\" is described in Section 61 as a document which contains all the prescribed terms, other than implied terms, and is, when presented to the debtor or hirer for signature, in such a state that all its terms are legible. Such a document must be in the form \\"prescribed by regulations\\".Goode (1979) p.183 The regulations in question are the 1983 Regulations (Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 (SI 1983/1553)). These regulations laid down specific rules regarding certain \\"prescribed terms\\". For example, a regulated credit agreement had to contain prescribed information about the amount of credit, the length of any fixed term loan, the amount of monthly repayments and so on. If a lender failed to comply with the prescribed regulations then the agreement would not be \\"properly executed\\" under section 61 and could then be challenged as \\"irredeemably unenforceable\\" under section 127. Withdrawals Part V contains several provisions relating to the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These are similar to those found in the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at common law; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.Goode (1979) p.190 The right to cancel a confirmed agreement was introduced by the Hire-Purchase Act 1964, mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right of cancellation is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a notice of writing given to the creditor or an agent of the creditor within six days of the agreement being made.Goode (1979) p.202 =Part VI: Matters arising during currency of credit or hire agreements= Section 75 protects consumers who use a credit card to pay for goods valued between ¬£100 and ¬£30,000 where the goods are not delivered or do not match the description given of the goods, or where the condition or functionality of the goods has been misrepresented. This section provides for credit card issuers to be jointly and severally liable along with the supplier for compliance with the contract of supply.Money, Section 75: Your free credit card purchase protection, accessed 24 July 2019Consumer Credit Act 1974, section 75 Originally this provision applied to payments for goods valued between ¬£30 and ¬£10,000. The limits were increased under the Consumer Credit (Increase of Monetary Limits) Order 1983, effective from 1 January 1984 (for the lower limit increase to ¬£100) and 20 May 1985 (for the upper limit increase to ¬£30,000).Consumer Credit (Increase of Monetary Limits) Order 1983 =Part VII: Default and terminationPart VIII: Security= The Act was the first attempt by the Government of the United Kingdom to provide coherent rules relating to the taking of securities when dealing with consumer credit. Other than the Bills of Sale Acts there had been little law on securities before this, apart from a few provisions in the Hire-Purchase Acts. The Consumer Credit Act devoted an entire part of the Act to security, mostly between debtor and creditor, with third-party rights and regulations mostly governed by common law. The Act provides the form of securities, requires certain information and documents to be supplied, controls the enforcement of securities and provides certain circumstances in which securities can be considered void.Goode (1979) p.260 \\"Security\\" is defined by the Act to mean any form of mortgage, bond, indemnity, guarantee or other right provided by the debtor as \\"security\\" to the consumer credit or hire- purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both \\"real\\" securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given at the request of the debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.Goode (1979) p.261 Certain other formalities must be observed; under Section 105, a security is not considered properly executed unless a document is signed on or on behalf of the debtor. This document must conform to certain regulations; the terms must be legible when it is presented to be signed, it must give all the terms and conditions other than implied terms, a copy must also be presented and if the security is provided before the regulated agreement is made, a copy of the security agreement must be given to the debtor within seven days of the regulated agreement being made.Goode (1979) p.262 If the formalities are not complied with the security agreement becomes unenforceable without a court order.Goode (1979) p.263 The Act does not provide for any civil or criminal sanctions for creditors who enforce the agreement without a court order, however, but it may lead to the revocation or suspension of the creditor's license.Goode (1979) p.265 =Part IX: Judicial control= Part IX gives the courts wide powers to re-open credit deals deemed extortionate and gives them control over regulated agreements. Section 189 establishes that \\"courts\\" means the county court; all problems are to be brought to the county court, although certain situations relating to extortionate credit agreements can be sent to the High Court.Goode (1979) p.321 Orders The County Court at Watford: the County Court deals with the majority of judicial actions brought under the Act. The courts are allowed to issue enforcement orders for cases where the contract has been infringed upon, except in situations where the contract has not been signed or the terms are not set out in the contract, in which case they are permanently unenforceable. The courts are also prohibited from making enforcement orders where the owner or creditor did not give a copy of the agreement to the debtor or hirer before the contract commenced. Other than this the court is obliged to issue such orders. There are also situations in which orders can be made even when there has been no infringement. These are when the debtor or hirer has died, to recover protected goods without the consent of a debtor and to enforce a land mortgage.Goode (1979) p.323 The courts can also make \\"time orders\\" providing for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non- payment of money or both. These orders are made at the discretion of the courts after an application for an enforcement order.Goode (1979) p.325 The time orders can also cover statutory bailment in the case of hire-order or hire-purchase agreements.Goode (1979) p.326 If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re- enacts Section 35 of the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.Goode (1979) p.330 Other orders are \\"special orders\\", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and transfer orders. Return orders are orders from the court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor if he does not return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment of the rest of the goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the returned goods.Goode (1979) p.332 Credit bargains The courts have long held equitable jurisdiction to set aside \\"harsh and unconscionable bargains\\", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The Moneylenders Act 1900 allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were \\"harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief\\", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used in the field of consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.Goode (1979) p.334 The Consumer Credit Act provided guidelines for the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the court‚Äôs jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter the terms of the agreement or order the return of any security.Goode (1979) p.341 This only covers consumer credit agreements, not hire agreements.Goode (1979) p.335 =Part X: Ancillary credit businesses=Definitions An ancillary credit business is defined in Section 145 of the Act as any business that works in credit brokerage, debt adjusting, debt collecting, debt counselling or as a credit reference agency.Goode (1979) p.346 Credit brokers are people involved in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally in exchange for a commission. Under the Act, \\"credit broker\\" includes not only mortgage brokers and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for hire-purchase agreements and solicitors who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.Goode (1979) p.347 Debt adjusting is when a company or individual negotiates with the creditor or owner in an agreement on behalf of the debtor to change the terms for the discharge of the debt, takes over the debt in exchange for payment by the debtor or engages in \\"any similar activity concerned with the liquidation of a debt\\". This is again a wide area; the base definition covers, for example, solicitors and accountants who act as negotiators for clients who owe money to a third party. There are certain exceptions; a solicitor negotiating for the settlement of his client's debts is not considered to be working as a debt adjuster thanks to Section 146 of the Act, which excludes \\"a solicitor engaging in contentious business\\" as defined in the Solicitors Act 1957.Goode (1979) p.348 Debt counselling is the giving of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer hire agreements. This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of if it is free legal advice; as a result the Citizens Advice Bureau, for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to \\"procure payment of debts due\\" under consumer credit agreements and consumer hire agreements. Those who \\"purchase\\" debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.Goode (1979) p.349 Exceptions for these definitions are provided under Section 146 if the credit broker, debt adjuster, debt counsellor or debt collector is the creditor or owner under the credit agreement, the supplier under the agreement, a credit broker who has acquired the business of the supplier or somebody expressly excluded from certain definitions, such as a solicitor. The provisions for suppliers only come into effect when the credit is a loan, so that the supplier and creditor are different people. The exceptions do not include people who \\"buy\\" the roles above by purchasing the debts, such as professional debt buyers or financial houses.Goode (1979) p.350 Credit reference agencies are covered separately from other ancillary credit businesses, and are defined in Section 148 as individuals or companies which carry on a business \\"comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant to the financial standard of individuals, being information collected by the agency for that purpose\\". This definition was the subject of much academic debate, because the holding of the license for a credit reference agency involves a duty to supply information on credit status which the company might prefer to keep confidential. There are exceptions; the information must be collected for the purpose of giving it to others, so the fact that a bank, for example, has that information, does not mean they need to obtain a license as a credit reference agency.Goode (1979) p.351 Licensing and other matters Part III of the Act applies directly to ancillary credit businesses, who must obtain a license. As with standard credit agreements, agreements made by an unlicensed ancillary trader are only enforceable against the other party if the Director General of Fair Trading issues an order which applies to the agreement. Under Section 149, creditors have an onus to make sure that the credit brokers they obtain business from are duly licensed. Again, if the broker is unlicensed, the agreement between the debtor and creditor is only enforceable when the Director General makes an order saying so. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1978.Goode (1979) p.353 Part IV of the Act also applies to ancillary credit businesses in relation to advertising, canvassing and quotations, as well as ways in which business can be sought. The Act also limited the brokerage fees that credit brokers can charge. Under Section 155, if the brokerage work does not lead to the client entering into an agreement with a creditor within 6 months of the work, the entire fee (minus the sum of ¬£1) is refundable to the client. The Director General at the time indicated that those businesses which flouted Section 155 would be refused a license. These provisions came into force on 1 April 1977.Goode (1979) p.354 =Part XI: Enforcement of ActPart XII: Supplement=Implementation of the Act Some elements of the Act came into force on 31 July 1974, the day it was passed, but many were left to be brought in later at the discretion of the government. This process was \\"painfully slow\\", with almost nothing apart from the licensing system being active in 1979. Section 141, which requires enforcement actions of a regulated credit or linked transaction to be pursued in the county court, came into force on 19 May 1985 through the statutory instrument \\"Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Commencement No. 8) Order 1983\\". The Act repealed the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, the Advertisements (Hire Purchase) Act 1967, the Moneylenders Act 1900, the Moneylenders Act 1927, the Pawnbrokers Act 1872 and the Pawnbrokers Act 1960. The Act was influential outside the United Kingdom, and was studied in both the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations. It formed the basis of a 1979 Directive on Consumer Credit of the European Union. The Act did not go to the full extent suggested by the Crowther Committee's report, with protection only being available for consumers, not for the credit industry.Rogerson (1975) p.436 The Act was widely supported by all sides of the political spectrum, and by academia. Arthur Rogerson compared it to the Law of Property Act 1925 in that, like the 1925 Act, it \\"represents fundamental rethinking of an area of great economic significance, which has resulted in the sweeping away of a chaos of obsolete rules, and the substitution for them of a simpler and better enforced body of law\\".Rogerson (1975) p.435 See also * Consumer Credit Act 2006 * Credit risk *Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) *Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2001] UKHL 52 ReferencesBibliography ;Primary sources  ;Secondary sources   External links  *The Office of Fair Trading * Consumer Credit Act * Consumer Credit Act 2006 - reform of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 *Business Link - Applying for a licence *Scanned copy of the original Act Category:Consumer protection law Category:Consumer protection legislation Category:Consumer protection in the United Kingdom Category:1974 in law Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1974 ","title":"Consumer Credit Act 1974"},{"id":"2285316","text":"Elysian Park neighborhood boundaries Park entrance, with Broadway on the right, about 1900 Waterfall and rock garden behind the former Police Academy, 1956 Los Angeles Police Academy, 2005 Dodger Stadium, 2007 Night view from the Park Row Bridge overlooking California State Route 110 and Downtown Los Angeles, 2018 Elysian Park is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California, with a mostly low-income community of 2,600+ people.

His parents were Shrikant Thackeray (younger brother of Bal Thackeray) and Kunda Thackeray (younger sister of Bal Thackeray's wife Meena Thackeray). As a child he learnt tabla, guitar and violin. Thackeray is a graduate of Mumbai's Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art Upon graduation he joined Marmik, the weekly magazine of Bal Thackeray, as a cartoonist.MNS official website Accessed October 2011. Political career Raj Thackeray resigned from his uncle's party in January 2006 and announced his intention to start a new political party. On 9 March 2006 in Mumbai, Thackeray founded \\"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena\\" party. At the time of the party's foundation, Thackeray stated that he does not want to have hostilities with his uncle who \\"was, is and always will be(his) mentor\\". In February 2008 Raj Thackeray led a violent movement against the dominance of migrants from the North Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Maharashtra and more so in its commercial capital of Mumbai. His party and Shiv Sena banned Australian cricketers participating in IPL 3 from playing in Mumbai as a protest against the attack on Indian students in Australia. At a rally in Shivaji Park, Raj warned that if the dadagiri (intimidating dominance) of these people (North Indians) in Mumbai and Maharashtra continued, he would be compelled to make them leave the metropolis. Raj was arrested along with a Samajwadi Party leader, Abu Azmi, but was released on paying a penalty of . =2008‚Äì2009= In July 2008, Raj issued a public warning that shops in Mumbai needed to have Marathi signboards in addition to the existing English signboards. He warned that after one month, MNS workers would start blackening non-Marathi signboards. While there had been a law to this effect passed earlier by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, it had not been enforced. In September 2008, MNS workers resorted to blackening signboards, to enforce the demand, after which most shop owners complied. Six MNS workers were arrested but later released on bail. Jaya Bachchan, veteran actor and MP of Samajwadi Party, during the Music launch of the Hindi film Drona, said 'Hum UP (Uttar Pradesh) ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log Maaf Kijiye' (We are people of UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please excuse). Thackeray commented that she had no business alluding to all the people of Maharashtra in that statement. He threatened to ban all Bachchan films unless Jaya apologised in a public forum for hurting Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theatres featuring films affiliated to her.It was only after Amitabh tendered an apology that the screening resumed. Following Raj's threat, Maharashtra Police acted against Raj, issuing a gag order preventing him from speaking to the media. In October 2008, Jet Airways laid off 800 temporary workers and announced layoffs of an additional 1100 workers. The laid-off workers included Marathi as well as North-Indians. Thackeray was asked to intervene. Following this, Raj Thackeray declared that most of these workers had paid security deposits to the company, and he would meet Jet management to plead their case. Unless Jet Airways cancelled the layoffs, his party would not allow any Jet Airways plane to take off from any airport in Maharashtra. Within 12 hours of Raj Thackeray's declaration, Jet chairman Naresh Goyal reversed the layoffs and reinstated the sacked employees. He said that he did it on his own and that there was no political pressure on him. =2009‚Äì2011= On 2 October 2009, MNS workers disrupted the screening of the film Wake Up Sid on its release in a few Pune and Mumbai theatres, after Raj objected to references in the movie to \\"Bombay\\" rather than \\"Mumbai\\". The city of Mumbai was referred to as \\"Bombay\\" in many scenes and in some songs (lyrics by Javed Akhtar). The film's producer, Karan Johar, visited Raj's residence to apologise, and agreed to all of Raj's terms, including an apology on each of the 700 frames in the film. Telecom companies in Maharashtra had been providing customer service in English & Hindi only. Raj demanded that all telecom companies operating in Maharashtra start providing the service in Marathi also and set a deadline of 27 February 2010, after which his party MNS would launch an agitation. Following this demand, all telecom companies complied, introducing Marathi as an additional option in their customer service. In Dec 2011, Raj Thackeray meeting a group from MES (Maharshtra Ekikaran Samiti) advised them that they should revisit their stand of merging Belgaum with Maharashtra in the interest of Marathi speaking people of Belgaum. In a major departure from the earlier held stand of traditional right wing groups of Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray pointed out that a practical approach rather than an emotional one is the need of the hour. However, he advocated that if the supreme court itself gives a decision in favour of Belgaum's merger, he would welcome it but the local situation in belgaum should not be vitiated for the sake of it. He asked the MES leaders to first identify the real issue as to whether marathis in belgaum are being targeted for espousing the cause of Marathi language or because they were supporting the merger of Belgaum with Maharashtra. Lamenting that strikes and bandhs only add to the misery of the Marathi-speaking community in Belgaum, Thackeray said: \\"If the Karnataka government is ready to respect the Marathi people, their culture and language, then there is nothing wrong in Belgaum being there.\\" His comments were strongly criticised by his cousin Uddhav as a cruel joke on the Marathi manoos.  Views  Raj Thackeray and his party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, state that Maharashtra State, Marathi language and Marathi Manoos are subverted by the influence of Marathi politicians.MNS official website Accessed October 2011. He has opposed migration into Maharashtra from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\\"Do political movements need to obey the law? What about Advani rath yatra, Modi‚Äôs Godhra outrage?\\" ExpressIndia.com. Retrieved 25 October 2011 Raj reproached North Indian leaders for politicising Chhath Puja, a festival popular in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand calling it a \\"drama\\" and a \\"show of numerical strength\\". He stated that the Chhath Puja was a political gimmick by some parties to attract the north Indian vote. He demanded that they only celebrate Maharashtra day and not it in Maharashtra. A petition was filed in the Patna civil court on 8 February against him for his remarks. His statements were criticised from political leaders, especially those from the North Indian states. He accused migrants of swamping Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, in search of jobs. The MNS chief also accused migrants of disrespecting the local culture. In 2008, expressing his stance on new migrants settling in Mumbai, Raj said, \\"New immigrants to the city should be denied entry into the city, while those already staying here should show respect to the Marathi 'manoos' and his culture\\". Thackeray and his party have been criticised for use of violence during their agitations, especially directed towards immigrants from UP and Bihar. On use of violence, Thackeray says that violence is a part of all agitations in Indian politics, and there are several cases of much more violence carried out by other parties and organisations. According to him, the incidences of violence involving members of his party have been unduly highlighted by North Indian politicians and journalists. Thackeray had initially praised former Chief Minister of Gujarat and incumbent Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi for his governance, and the development of Gujarat during his tenure as chief minister. He had also expressed support for Modi for the post of Prime Minister for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Although later on, he regretted his support for Modi and since then has been a vocal critic of him and the NDA government.For the 2019 elections to the Loksabha, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, did not contest any seats, and instead Raj Thakeray urged the party supporters to vote for the NCP‚ÄìCongress alliance, with Thakeray campaigning for candidates belonging to these parties. Thackeray-led MNS criticised the centre's move to award the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, to Adnan Sami, claiming that Sami was not an original Indian citizen. Personal life Thackeray is married to Sharmila Wagh, daughter of Marathi cinema photographer, producer-director Mohan Wagh. They have a son, Amit Thackeray and a daughter, Urvashi Thackeray.

He was the brother of King Ferdinand III of Castile and Le√≥n, and father of Queen Maria of Molina, wife of King Sancho IV. He became Lord of Molina and Mesa after his first marriage to Mafalda Gonz√°lez de Lara, the heiress of those lands. Family origins Alfonso was the son of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and his second wife, Queen Berengaria of Castile. On his father's side he was the grandson of King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n and his first wife, Urraca of Portugal. On his mother's side his grandparents were King Alfonso VIII of Castile and his wife, Eleanor of England. His siblings included King Ferdinand III of Castile and Le√≥n, Berengaria, Constance, and Eleanor. Life Alfonso was born near the city of Le√≥n in 1202. As the son of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and Berengaria of Castile, he witnessed the bad relations between the two kingdoms during his childhood, after the annulment of his parents' marriage. At the Battle of Navas de Tolosa (1212), his father and the King of Portugal were the only kings from the Iberian Peninsula who did not take part, in contrast to those of Castile, Aragon, and Navarre. In fact, Alfonso IX took advantage of the absence of his cousin Alfonso VIII to invade Castile. In 1222 Ferdinand III found himself at odds with Gonzalo P√©rez de Lara, Lord of Molina, due to the latter's support of Alfonso IX. But the two kings managed to come to terms, ratifying the Treaty of Zafra in 1223. Berengaria played an active role in the negotiations. The aim of Gonzalo's martial actions, including the devastation of some villages near Medinaceli, was to foment an uprising of Castilian nobles against Ferdinand in support of his father.View of the castle of Molina de Arag√≥n, seat of the Lordship of Molina. Ferdinand was now bitterly opposed to the autonomy enjoyed by Gonzalo and his family, the House of Lara, one of the most powerful in the realm alongside that of Haro. He laid siege to the Castle of Zafra, where Gonzalo took refuge with his retainers and family. Gonzalo ultimately surrendered and accepted the conditions imposed on him. The first of these was that the Lordship of Molina would not, upon his death, pass to Gonzalo's son, Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara \\"the Disinherited\\", but rather to his daughter Mafalda Gonz√°lez de Lara, who would meanwhile marry infante Alfonso de Molina. Thus the Crown would establish control over the Lordship of Molina. The Treaty of Zafra was the prelude to the future annexation of the Lordship of Molina by the Crown of Castile. Pedro Gonzalez de Lara \\"the Disinherited\\" left for the Kingdom of Aragon and always considered himself the legitimate lord of Molina. In his last will, executed in 1268, he bequeathed the lordship to infante Fernando de la Cerda, the first-born son of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage between Alfonso of Molina and Mafalda Gonz√°lez de Lara took place in 1240, and upon the death of Mafalda's father, Gonzalo P√©rez de Lara, infante Alfonso, through his wife, became Lord of Molina in 1243 and governed the lordship for the rest of his life, at first jointly with his wife, and then, after her death, alone, just as stipulated in the marriage contract. He, and later his daughter Blanca, expanded the provisions of the fueros of the Lordship of Molina. According to contemporary chroniclers, Alfonso of Molina was a man possessed of considerable virtues as well as a calm temperament. In 1230, on the death of his father Alfonso IX, he could have sought the throne of Le√≥n, since Alfonso IX did not wish to bequeath it to his other son Ferdinand III, who was already King of Castile. In fact Alfonso IX named as his heirs his two daughters, infantas Sancha and Dulce. However, thanks to a substantial financial compensation, they renounced the throne of Le√≥n in the Treaty of Benavente, ratified with Ferdinand in the presence of the many magnates and prelates of the realm. Alfonso of Molina, who had previously refused the throne, was rewarded by the king with his favor, with distinctions, and with many gifts, lands, and privileges. He accompanied his brother on most of his military campaigns and was closely identified with the cause of the Reconquista as well as whatever enterprises the king might undertake. Campaign in Andalusia and the Battle of Jerez (1231) In 1231, while he visited the main cities of Le√≥n after having taken possession of it, Ferdinand reportedly sent his son Infante Alfonso, then nine years of age and living in Salamanca, to lay waste to the Almohad Caliphate territories around C√≥rdoba and Seville, accompanied by √Ålvaro P√©rez \\"the Castilian\\" de Castro and the magnate Gil Manrique. Nevertheless, various historians have indicated that the infante Alfonso to which contemporary chronicles refer was not the king's son, but rather his brother, Alfonso of Molina. But according to the version which holds that the infante Alfonso present at the Battle of Jerez was actually King Fernando III's son, \\"he sent Don Alvar de Castro, the Castilian, to go with him, to watch over the infante and as commander of the army, for the infante was very young and not yet so energetic, and Don Alvar P√©rez was a respected and very energetic man.\\"alc√°zar of Jerez de la Frontera. The Battle of Jerez, waged in 1231, spelt defeat for the forces of the Emir of Al-Andalus. From Salamanca, and passing through Toledo where they were joined by 40 knights, they made their way toward And√∫jar. From there, they began to devastate the countryside around Cordoba, and later the provincial town of Palma del R√≠o. They exterminated all the inhabitants and seized the town, then proceeded toward Seville and Jerez de la Frontera, and camped there near the Guadalete River. Emir Ibn Hud, who had gathered a large army of seven divisions, positioned himself between the Castilians and Jerez, forcing them to give battle. During the subsequent engagement, known as the Battle of Jerez, the Castilians defeated Ibn Hud in spite of his numerical superiority. Later, King Alfonso X referred to the 1231 battle as follows: \\"It is fitting that you who are hearing this story know that the thing in the world that most broke the Moors, why they had to lose Andalusia and the Christians gain it from them, was this battle of Jerez. That is how the Moors were shattered. They could never again muster the daring nor the effort which they had previously against the Christians, such was the level of the shock and fear they experienced on that occasion.\\" After his victory in the Battle of Jerez, √Ålvaro P√©rez de Castro the Castilian returned to Castile and handed Infante Alfonso over to his father the king, who was in Palencia. Conquests of Cordoba and Seville and actions during the reign of Alfonso X (1236‚Äì1272) In 1236 Alfonso of Molina distinguished himself in the conquest of Cordoba, the old capital of the Caliphate of Cordoba. Twelve years later, in 1248, he took part in the siege of Seville and captured the Torre de Oro. He also occupied a part of the √Ålcazar of Seville, which was known as the \\"Walls of the Infante of Molina\\". Alfonso X taking possession of the sea after the conquest of C√°diz. Mat√≠as Moreno. 1866. In the division of the territory of Seville proclaimed on 1 May 1253, almost a year after the death of his brother Ferdinand III and during the reign of his nephew Alfonso X, Infante Alfonso of Molina received large grants and was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the land distribution due to his status as younger brother of Ferdinand III. The late king had asked his son Alfonso X in his will to hold him in high regard. Later life In 1254 he entered the Order of Calatrava, obliged to wear their habit and assured that on his death his body would be buried in the order's main monastery. He attended the Valladolid Cortes of 1258, whose main purpose was to obtain money to fund Alfonso X's designs on the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. He also attended the Toledo Cortes of 1259, whose purpose was the same, and the Jerez Council of 1268. He attended the wedding of Infante Fernando de la Cerda, first-born son and heir of Alfonso X, to Blanche of France, held in Burgos on 30 November 1269. Death and burial In his 1254 will, made at the time he entered the Order of Calatrava, Alfonso of Molina stipulated that he be buried in the church of the castle of Calatrava la Nueva, headquarters of the order, located in what is today Ciudad Real province. Alfonso of Molina died in Salamanca on 6 January 1272 at the age of 70. Alfonso's body was provisionally buried in the monastery of San Francisco in Salamanca, which is no longer extant. Later, his remains were transferred to Calatrava la Nueva as specified in his will, and placed in a sumptuous sepulchre which lay under an arch in the main chapel of the monastery's church. This sepulchre and his remains have not survived to the present day. Marriage and children Alfonso of Molina married, in 1240, Mafalda Gonz√°lez de Lara, Lady of Molina, daughter of Gonzalo P√©rez de Lara, 3rd Lord of Molina and Mesa, and his wife, Sancha G√≥mez de Trava. They had two children: * Fernando Alfonso of Molina (1242‚Äì1250). * Blanca Alfonso of Molina (1243‚Äì1292), who inherited the Lordship of Molina after her father's death. In 1269, she married Alfonso Fern√°ndez de Castilla, illegitimate son of Alfonso X. In 1244, widowed of his first wife, he married his second, Teresa Gonz√°lez de Lara, daughter of Count Gonzalo N√∫√±ez de Lara, Lord of Belorado, and his wife Mar√≠a D√≠az I de Haro. They had a daughter: * Juana Alfonso of Molina (1245/1246- after 1307), in 1269 married Lope D√≠az III de Haro, Lord of Biscay, who was killed by Sancho IV of Castile in Alfaro in 1288. She was the mother of Diego L√≥pez IV de Haro (died 1289) and Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro, Lady of Biscay, who married infante John of Castile \\"el de Tarifa\\". He married, in 1260 as this third wife, Mayor Alfonso de Meneses (c. 1230 ‚Äì after 1265), Lady of Meneses and Villanueva, widow of Gonzalo Gil of Villalobos and daughter of Alfonso T√©llez de Meneses \\"el Mozo\\", 4th Lord of Meneses, San Rom√°n and Villanueva, and his first wife Mar√≠a Y√°√±ez de Lima.

Alfonso of Molina also had several illegitimate children from various extramarital relationships: * Juan Alfonso of Molina (1225‚Äì1293) was declared legitimate by Pope Innocent IV in a bull published 14 October 1243. He was dean of Burgos Cathedral, and later Bishop of Palencia from 1278 to 1293. In order to be named Bishop of Palencia he had to receive a dispensation, which was published by Pope Alexander IV on 24 January 1259. * Urraca Alfonso (1225/1230? - ?) married Garc√≠a G√≥mez Carrillo \\"el de los Garfios\\" ('he of the hooks'), lord of Mazuelo and defender of the fortress of Jerez de la Frontera. * Berengaria Fern√°ndez (1230/1235? - 1272), Lady of Melgoso and Caldelas, she was the daughter of the Portuguese noblewoman Teresa Fern√°ndez de Bragan√ßa.

It was manufactured by Cadaco-Ellis and designed by baseball player Ethan Allen. The game first appeared in 1941 and a special version is still sold today. It was the best-selling baseball board game of all time, and is the only such game to have been distributed through mass market channels and toy stores for any extended period of time. The annual versions of the game were discontinued in the mid-1990s due to the loss of market share to video games and greatly increased player licensing costs, but a commemorative version was issued in 2003. Unlike more simulation-focused competitors, most notably Strat-o-Matic Baseball, ASB is aimed at a younger audience and is simpler to play. The initial target audience was boys 9‚Äì12 years old. It simulates batters' performance well, but makes no attempt to model the performance of individual pitchers. Nevertheless, many fans passionately bought each year's cards and collected statistics from neighborhood leagues, some amassing as many as 2,500 games worth of paper box scores and comparing those totals with the actual players' statistics. Game play The game board for ASB has two spinners on top of a diagram of a baseball field. A hole for a baserunner peg is cut at the location of each base. A cardboard back panel is inserted into cut-out slots in the board, displays the key to the game cards and cardboard wheels that can be turned to display the correct inning, the number of outs and the score. Each circular player card has a series of lines and numbers arranged in a circle around its center. The card is placed on a spinner, which the batting player spins. (Aficionados would spin the metal pointers with rubber bands to avoid blisters.) Once the spinner came to rest between two lines, the number for that section defined what happened to that batter. If one or more runners were on base, the pitching player would spin the other spinner, which displayed zones that defined whether runners advanced, scored or were out on the play. Some special plays, as well as attempted steals, required the use of two special pink situation cards, which went on the pitching player's spinner and indicated the result when spun. There were no pitching cards nor fielding cards, although pitchers' batting statistics were present on their cards. This made the game inherently less mathematically accurate than its older-audience rivals. The chart for the meaning of each number on the cards is below. The earliest versions of ASB utilized this list: *1 Home Run *2 Ground out, double play with runner on first base *3 Runner reaches base on error *4 Fly out, all runners advance *5 Triple *6 Ground out, all runners advance *7 Single, runners advance one base *8 Fly out, runner on third base scores, others hold *9 Walk (Base on balls) *10 Strikeout *11 Double *12 Ground out, runners advance if forced *13 Single, runners advance two bases *14 Fly out, runners hold their bases Later versions featured a simpler chart, augmented by second spins on the fielding player's side (presumably to give that player more to do), with only the \\"3\\" section fundamentally changed: *1 Home Run *2 Ground out *3 Fly out (Formerly Safe on error) *4 Fly out *5 Triple *6 Ground out *7 Single *8 Fly out *9 Walk (Base on balls) *10 Strikeout *11 Double *12 Ground out *13 Single *14 Fly out For the 1975 release, the batting chart was reduced to the eight possible results: *1 Home Run *2 Triple *3 Double *4 Single *5 Fly Out *6 Ground Out *7 Base on Balls *8 Strikeout All other rules of the game match those of regular baseball. Players Until about 1980 ASB had a mix of current Major League stars and Hall of Fame players. As more athletes (and their estates) asserted licensing rights over the use of their names the old-time players were dropped from the game, although a handful of individuals were included occasionally in an annual set. Each of the then current players were asked to sign off on a release form granting permission to include their batting statistics in the game. This practice continued for almost 50 years after the introduction of the game. Although a few declined, most agreed despite the fact that they were not compensated for being included. In 1995 the game came under the MLBPA license, which made the design of the game cards more sophisticated but also added significantly to the cost of production. Since the change in its business model to absorb the MLBPA royalties Cadaco has stopped issuing regular annual updates to the game, and its publishing future remains unclear. Although numbers have varied, the typical ASB boxed set contained 40 player cards for early sets, and 63 player cards for later sets. Cards During most of its history ASB has had annual updates of its boxed board game with new players and updated stats. During some eras Cadaco- Ellis has also sold older cards by mail, and in recent years the cards have become popular on eBay. As part of the special 2003 commemorative version, Cadaco also issued separate individually packaged sets of player cards for an All-Star Player Pack, the 2003 Ultimate Series (New York Yankees vs. Florida Marlins) and the 2003 Fantasy Series (Boston Red Sox vs. Chicago Cubs). These held action photos to further identify them as being collectible baseball cards. There is a significant collectors market for older cards, which are broken down into several eras (all years are approximate) as printing technology evolved: *1941-1958‚ÄîBlack and white cards printed on heavy cardboard, with die-cut center opening so the card can be put on a cardboard block to hold it steady beneath the spinner on the game board. Most if not all years' cards in this era have solid dark green backs. *1959-1962‚ÄîOld time players' cards are printed in red instead of black. The cardboard is lighter weight. *1962-1967‚ÄîCurrent players are on multicolored cards with blue-gray backgrounds and with key colors indicating American or National League. Old time players' cards have red backgrounds. Wooden baserunner pegs were also replaced with plastic pegs at this time. *1968-1988‚ÄîThe game board is redesigned and the cardboard block to hold the cards beneath the spinner is replaced with a plastic holder on which the spinner rests; the card is inserted in the top of the holder and is centered beneath the spinner. This eliminated the need for the die-cut hole in the middle of the card, making them less likely to tear. Some die-hard players, accustomed to holding the cards through the center hole, manually cut holes in the new cards. *1989-1991, 1993, 2003-2004‚ÄîPlayer photographs are added to the cards, in part to try to increase their collector value. Variants The published 1941 game was considered only a first draft. In 1975, Cadaco did try a version with 8 categories instead of 14, but the cards were already collected by dedicated players and the re-design was abandoned by Cadaco. Despite the increases in complexity, the game was intended for boys, not adults.

It was developed in 1983 as a medication for Soviet Cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort led by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (–í–∞–ª–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ê—Ö–∞–ø–∫–∏–Ω–∞). In Russia it is now available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. Uses A few small clinical studies have shown possible links between prescription of phenylpiracetam and improvement in a number of encephalopathic conditions, including lesions of cerebral blood pathways, traumatic brain injury and certain types of glioma. Phenylpiracetam reverses the depressant effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam, increases operant behavior, inhibits post-rotational nystagmus, prevents retrograde amnesia, and has anticonvulsant properties. Phenylpiracetam is typically prescribed as a general stimulant or to increase tolerance to extreme temperatures and stress. Phenylpiracetam has been researched for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pilot-cosmonaut Aleksandr Serebrov described being issued and using Phenylpiracetam, as well as it being included in the Soyuz spacecraft's standard emergency medical kit, during his 197-days working in space aboard the Mir space station.

The Serbsky Center, Moscow Institute of Psychiatry, and Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology are reported to have confirmed the effectiveness of Phenylpiracetam(Phenytropil) describing the following effects: improvement of regional blood flow in ischemic regions of the brain, reduction of depressive and anxiety disorders, increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psychoactivating(sic) effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of sleep, and an anticonvulsant action, though with the side effect of an anorexic effect in extended use. =Animal Model Research= In Wistar rats with gravitational cerebral ischemia, Phenylpiracetam reduced the extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of carotid arteries to a greater extent than did piracetam. Operant behavior Phenylpiracetam is known to increase operant behavior. In tests against a control, Sprague-Dawley rats given free access to less-preferred rat chow and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given methylphenidate, d-amphetamine, and phenylpiracetam. Rats given 1 mg/kg amphetamine performed an average of 150% as much work and consumed 50% as much non-preferred rat chow than control rats; rats given 10 mg/kg Methylphenidate performed 170% as much work and consumed similarly; and rats given 100 mg/kg Phenylpiracetam performed an average of 375% as much work, and consumed little non-preferred rat chow. Pharmacology Phenylpiracetam binds to Œ±4Œ≤2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mouse brain cortex with IC50 = 5.86 ŒºM. In rats, scopolamine is used to model memory impairment. It impairs performance in the conditioned passive avoidance reflex test, increases cortical nACh and hippocampal NMDA receptor densities, and decreases striatal D1 and cortical benzodiazepine receptor densities. Phenylpiracetam demonstrates antiamnestic activity by restoring performance in the passive avoidance test and partially reversing each of these scopolamine-induced receptor density changes. Experiments performed on Sprague-Dawley rats in a European patent for using Phenylpiracetam to treat sleep disorders showed an increase in extracellular dopamine levels after administration. The patent asserts discovery of phenylpiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor as its basis. Phenylpiracetam may also act as a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, making it an NDRI. Availability Phenotropil 100 mg from Russia While not prescribed as a pharmaceutical in the West, in Russia it was available as a prescription medicine under the name Phenotropil until April 2017. Phenylpiracetam is not scheduled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.List of Controlled Substances Since 2020, it is available as Nanotropil Novo. Athlete doping Because it increases physical stamina and provides improved tolerance to cold weather, it appears on the lists of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the World Anti-Doping Agency. This list is applicable in all Olympic sports.https://www.wada- ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2016-09-29_-_wada_prohibited_list_2017_eng_final.pdf Page-6 See also * Doping in sport * Methylphenylpiracetam, a methylated analog * Phenylpiracetam hydrazide * Phensuximide, a succinimide analog * Racetams * Phenibut, also included in cosmonaut medical kits References Category:Acetamides Category:Drugs in sport Category:Drugs in the Soviet Union Category:Nicotinic agonists Category:Nootropics Category:Norepinephrine- dopamine reuptake inhibitors Category:Phenyl compounds Category:Racetams Category:Russian drugs Category:Russian inventions Category:Stimulants Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances ","title":"Phenylpiracetam"},{"id":"2285374","text":"Olearius is a surname.

Biography=Early years= Dynes was born in Ontario, Canada, where he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Western Ontario in 1964. He then earned master's (1965) and doctorate (1968) degrees in physics from McMaster University. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1984. =Career = Dynes worked at Bell Laboratories from 1964 to 1990, studying semiconductors and superconductors. He then became professor of physics at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), in 1991. In 1996 he became Chancellor of the UCSD campus, then in 2003 was chosen to be the 18th President of the University of California system. Dynes' scientific honors include the 1990 Fritz London Memorial Prize in Low Temperature Physics and his 2001 election to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences, a society to which he was elected in 1989. Dynes is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dynes remains active in his research and heads a modest sized low temperature physics laboratory at Berkeley.
