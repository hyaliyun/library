The United Front was assembled by key leaders of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, particularly president Burhanuddin Rabbani and former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud. Initially it included mostly Tajiks but by 2000, leaders of other ethnic groups had joined the Northern Alliance. This included Abdul Rashid Dostum, Dr.Abdullah Abdullah, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Abdul Qadir, Asif Mohseni and others. The Northern Alliance fought a defensive war against the Taliban government. They received support from Iran, Russia, Turkey, India, Tajikistan and others, while the Taliban were backed , weaponized & trained by Pakistan Army. By 2001 the Northern Alliance controlled less than 10% of the country, cornered in the north-east and based in Badakhshan province. The US invaded Afghanistan, providing support to Northern Alliance troops on the ground in a two-month war against the Taliban, which they won in December 2001. With the Taliban forced from control of the country, the Northern Alliance was dissolved as members and parties supported the new Afghan Interim Administration, with some members later becoming part of the Karzai administration. Commanders and factions The United Front was formed in late 1996 against the Taliban government by opposition factions. Since early 1999, Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only main leader able to defend his territory against the Taliban, and as such remained as the main de facto political and military leader of the United Front recognized by members of all the different ethnic groups. Massoud decided on the main political line and the general military strategy of the alliance. A part of the United Front military factions, such as Junbish-i Milli or Hezb-e Wahdat, however, did not fall under the direct control of Massoud but remained under their respective regional or ethnic leaders. Military commanders of the United Front were either independent or belonged to one of the following political parties: * the Sunni Tajik-dominated Jamiat-e Islami and Shura-e Nazar, led by Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Massoud * the Sunni Uzbek and Turkmen- dominated Junbish-i Milli, led by Abdul Rashid Dostum * the Sunni Pashtun- dominated Eastern Shura, led by Haji Abdul Qadeer * the Shia Tajik and Hazara- dominated Harakat-e Islami, led by Asif Mohseni * the Shia Hazara-dominated Hezb-e Wahdat, led by Muhammad Mohaqiq and Karim Khalili Military commanders and subcommanders of the United Front included * From northern Afghanistan: Bismillah Khan Mohammadi (Jamiat-e Islami), Atta Muhammad Nur (Jamiat-e Islami), Mohammed Daud Daud (Jamiat-e Islami), Mohammed Fahim (Jamiat-e Islami), Gul Haidar (Jamiat-e Islami), Muhammad Mohaqiq (Hezb-e Wahdat), Abdul Rashid Dostum (Junbish-i Milli), Qazi Kabir Marzban; * From eastern Afghanistan: Haji Abdul Qadeer (Eastern Shura), Hazrat Ali (Eastern Shura), Jaan Daad Khan, Abdullah Wahedi, Qatrah and Najmuddin; * From southern Afghanistan: Qari Baba, Mohammad Arif Noorzai and Hotak; * From western Afghanistan: Ismail Khan (Jamiat-e Islami), Doctor Ibrahim, and Fazlkarim Aimaq; * From central Afghanistan: Sayed Mustafa Kazemi (Hezb-e Wahdat), Said Hussein Aalemi Balkhi, Akbari, Mohammad Ali Jawed, Karim Khalili (Hezb-e Wahdat) and Sher Alam Ibrahimi (Ittehad-e Islami). The two main political candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election both worked for the United Front: * Abdullah Abdullah (was a close friend of Ahmad Shah Massoud and the foreign minister of the alliance) * Hamid Karzai (his father was killed by the Taliban, he subsequently went on a diplomatic mission to gather support for Massoud in Europe and the U.S in 2000/2001) History=Background= thumb270pxAfghanistan after the Soviet retreat.

After the fall of the Soviet-backed communist Najibullah government in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period to be followed by general elections. According to Human Rights Watch: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan. Afghanistan expert Amin Saikal concludes in Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival: In addition, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as competitors for regional hegemony, supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other. According to Human Rights Watch, Iran was backing the Shia Hazara Hezb-e Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari in order to \\"maximize Wahdat's military power and influence\\".GUTMAN, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington, D.C. Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and his Ittehad-e Islami faction. A publication by the George Washington University describes: Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war. Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project. Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders. Human Rights Watch writes: Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was under the control of local leaders not affiliated with the central government in Kabul. In 1994, the Taliban ‚Äì a movement originating from Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam‚Äìrun religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan ‚Äì also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force.Matinuddin, Kamal, The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994‚Äì1997, Oxford University Press, (1999), pp. 25‚Äì26 In November 1994 they took control of the southern city of Kandahar and subsequently expanded their control into several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan not under the central government's control. Massoud (red), Dostum (green) and Taliban (yellow) territories. In late 1994, most of the militia factions which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's Minister of Defense Ahmad Shah Massoud. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt.Amnesty International. \\"Document ‚Äì Afghanistan: further information on fear for safety and new concern: Deliberate and arbitrary killings: Civilians in Kabul\\". November 16, 1995. Accessed at: Amnesty.org The Islamic State government took steps to restore law and order. Courts started to work again. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process but they refused as they opposed a democratic system. The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under Ahmad Shah Massoud. Amnesty International, referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report: The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses which led analysts to believe the Taliban movement had run its course. At that point Pakistan and Saudi Arabia drastically increased their support to the Taliban. Many analysts like Amin Saikal describe the Taliban as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests. On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia, prepared for another major offensive against the capital Kabul, Massoud ordered a full retreat from the city.Coll, Ghost Wars (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14. The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. =Creation of the United Front= Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, former enemies, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum, Hazara troops led by Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir. Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai, Abdullah Abdullah and Masood Khalili. From the Taliban conquest of Kabul in September 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as Badakhshan, Kapisa, Takhar and parts of Parwan, Kunar, Nuristan, Laghman, Samangan, Kunduz, Gh≈çr and Bamyan. =Pakistani military interference= Due to the involvement of Indian intelligence (RAW) in supporting the Northern Alliance, Pakistan looked to neutralise this threat by cultivating the Taliban. In 2001 alone, according to several international sources, 28,000‚Äì30,000 Afghans, which took refuge in Pakistan during Afghan jihad, 14,000‚Äì15,000 Afghan Taliban and 2,000‚Äì3,000 Al Qaeda militants were fighting against anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan as a roughly 45,000 strong military force. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ‚Äì then as Chief of Army Staff ‚Äì was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and Bin Laden against the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Of the estimated 28,000 Afghan refugees returned from Pakistan fighting in Afghanistan, 8,000 were militants recruited in madrassas filling regular Taliban ranks. A 1998 document by the U.S. State Department confirms that \\"20‚Äì40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are returned Afghans from Pakistani refugee camps\\". Human Rights Watch wrote in 2000: On August 1, 1997 the Taliban launched an attack on Sheberghan, the main military base of Abdul Rashid Dostum. Dostum has said the reason the attack was successful was due to 1500 Pakistani commandos taking part and that the Pakistani air force also gave support. In 1998, Iran accused Pakistan of sending its air force to bomb Mazar-i-Sharif in support of Taliban forces and directly accused Pakistani troops for \\"war crimes at Bamiyan\\". The same year Russia said that Pakistan was responsible for the military expansion of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan by sending large numbers of Pakistani troops, some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the anti-Taliban United Front. In 2000, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the Taliban, with UN officials explicitly singling out Pakistan. The UN secretary-general implicitly criticized Pakistan for its military support and the Security Council stated it was \\"deeply distress[ed] over reports of involvement in the fighting, on the Taliban side, of thousands of non-Afghan nationals\\". In July 2001, several countries including the United States, accused Pakistan of being \\"in violation of U.N. sanctions because of its military aid to the Taliban\\". In 2000, British Intelligence reported that the ISI was taking an active role in several Al Qaeda training camps. The ISI helped with the construction of training camps for both the Taliban and Al Qaeda. From 1996 to 2001 the Al Qaeda of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri became a state within the Taliban state. Bin Laden sent Arab and Central Asian Al-Qaeda militants to join the fight against the United Front among them his Brigade 055. With the fall of Kabul to anti-Taliban forces in November 2001, ISI forces worked with and helped Taliban militias who were in full retreat. In November 2001, Taliban, Al-Qaeda combatants and ISI operatives were safely evacuated from Kunduz on Pakistan Air Force cargo aircraft to Pakistan Air Force bases in Chitral and Gilgit in Pakistan's Northern Areas in what has been dubbed the \\"Airlift of Evil\\". The role of the Pakistani military has been described by international observers as well as by the anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud as a \\"creeping invasion\\". The \\"creeping invasion\\" proved unable to defeat the severely outnumbered anti-Taliban forces. =Taliban massacres= According to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been \\"15 massacres\\" between 1996 and 2001. They also said, that \\"[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself\\". Al Qaeda's so-called 055 Brigade was also responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters \\"carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\\". =Ahmad Shah Massoud= After longstanding battles especially for the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish-i Milli forces alongside allied Hezb-e Wahdat forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile. Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside Afghanistan who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Pakistan army, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud money and a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview: > The Taliban say: \\"Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with > us\\", and they would keep the highest office in the country, the > presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns > mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the > state. We can not accept their conditions of compromise, or else we would > have to give up the principles of modern democracy. We are fundamentally > against the system called \\"the Emirate of Afghanistan\\". > There should be an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself > happy. And I think that can only be assured by democracy based on consensus. Massoud wanted to convince the Taliban to join a political process leading towards democratic elections in a foreseeable future. He also stated: > The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced > from the people now. They are weaker than in the past. There is only the > assistance given by Pakistan, Osama bin Laden and other extremist groups > that keep the Taliban on their feet. With a halt to that assistance, it is > extremely difficult to survive. In early 2001 the United Front employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals. Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society including the Pashtun areas. In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban. Many civilians fled to the area of Ahmad Shah Massoud. National Geographic concluded in its documentary \\"Inside the Taliban\\": \\"The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud\\". In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women's Rights Declaration. At the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed Kabul government of the early 1990s. Already in 1999 the United Front leadership ordered the training of police forces specifically to keep order and protect the civilian population in case the United Front would be successful. In early 2001 Ahmad Shah Massoud addressed the European Parliament in Brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan. He stated that the Taliban and Al Qaeda had introduced \\"a very wrong perception of Islam\\" and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year. On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent. On September 9, 2001, two Arab suicide attackers, allegedly belonging to Al Qaeda, posing as journalists, detonated a bomb hidden in a video camera while interviewing Ahmed Shah Massoud in the Takhar province of Afghanistan. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to a hospital. He was buried in his home village of Bazarak in the Panjshir Valley. The funeral, although taking place in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people. The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the attacks in the U.S. two days later, which killed nearly 3,000 people and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. John P. O'Neill was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, John O'Neill told two of his friends, > We're due. And we're due for something big. ... Some things have happened in > Afghanistan [referring to the assassination of Massoud]. I don't like the > way things are lining up in Afghanistan. ... I sense a shift, and I think > things are going to happen. ... soon. O'Neill died the following day, when > the south tower collapsed. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, United Front troops ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul with American air support in Operation Enduring Freedom, using intelligence reports offered by Iran during the Six plus Two Group meetings at the United Nations Headquarters. In November and December 2001 the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government of Hamid Karzai in late 2001. =Post 9/11= United Front troops lined up next to the runway at Bagram Airfield in Parwan Province. (December 16, 2001) After the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the United Front succeeded in retaking Kabul from the Taliban with air support from US-led forces during Operation Enduring Freedom.* In 2019, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy remarked that the U.S. partnership with the Northern Alliance was a very successful model that was later followed in northern Iraq and Syria. Despite fears of a return to the chaos similar to that of the 1992‚Äì1996 civil war, all the Afghan leaders met in Germany to create a new government. Hamid Karzai was chosen to lead the country and most key positions were given to Tajik members of the Northern Alliance. This created a major international issue. While Pakistan has always favored Afghanistan's major ethnic group, the Pashtun, India saw an opportunity for increasing its regional power by jumping on board with the support of the Northern Alliance in the early days of the war.Atul Aneja, \\"High Stakes for India\\" The Hindu, October 8th 2001. With both nations seeking to increase or maintain their regional power through opposing factions on the ground, the conflict in Afghanistan has increasingly been seen by observers as a proxy-war between these powers. From 2002 to 2004 Afghanistan witnessed relative calm. By 2006, however, with the support of Pakistan, a Taliban insurgency was increasingly gaining strength. In 2010, Afghan President Karzai decided that the only way to end the Taliban insurgency is to call for peace. This process became accepted and supported by all international partners of Afghanistan, except by several key figures of the Northern Alliance such as Abdullah Abdullah, Ahmad Zia Massoud, Mohammad Mohaqiq, and others. The opposition, by then splintered into several parties, warned that Karzai's appeasement policy could come at the cost of Afghanistan's political and economic development, and the progress made in areas such as education and women's rights. As the opposition leaders were excluded from secret talks with the Taliban by NATO and the Karzai administration and Karzai's political rhetoric was increasingly adjusted to Taliban demands, United Front leaders, in late 2011, regrouped to oppose a return of the Taliban to Afghanistan. Legacy Between 1996 and 2001, the Northern Alliance blocked the Taliban and al-Qaeda from gaining control of the entirety of Afghanistan. Many internally displaced persons found shelter in areas controlled by Ahmad Shah Massoud. After the September 2001 attacks in the United States, U.S. air raids followed by ground troops of the United Front ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul. Between November and December 2001, the United Front gained control of most major Afghan cities. Had it not been for the United Front, the U.S. would have needed to deploy large number of ground troops, as was done in the Iraq War. The United Front was influential in the transitional Afghan Government of Hamid Karzai from 2001 until 2004. Notably, Mohammed Fahim became the Vice President and Defense Minister, Yunus Qanuni became the Minister of Education and Security Advisor and Abdullah Abdullah became the Foreign Minister. Most foreign observers expected this dominance to continue and for Fahim or Qanuni to be selected as Karzai's Vice President in the 2004 elections. However, Karzai instead selected Ahmad Zia Massoud, younger brother of the former United Front leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. Karzai easily won the 2004 Presidential election with 55.4% of the vote, followed by three former leaders of the Northern Alliance, Quanuni (16.3%), Mohaqiq (11.7%) and Dostum (10%). Some of the military strength of the UIF has now been absorbed into the military of Afghanistan, while many of the remaining soldiers were disarmed through a nationwide disarmament program. The existence and strength of the Afghan National Army has significantly reduced the threat of the former UIF elements attempting to use military action against the new NATO-backed Afghan government. Most of the country's senior military personnel are former members of the UIF, including Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Some members of the alliance are now part of the United National Front (Afghanistan) which is led by Rabbani and includes some former leaders of the UIF such as Yunus Qanuni, Mohammed Fahim, and Abdul Rashid Dostum. The United National Front has positioned itself as a \\"loyal\\" opposition to Hamid Karzai. Others like Abdul Rasul Sayyaf claim to be loyal to Hamid Karzai while, however, following their own agenda. Abdullah Abdullah, a doctor of medicine and one of Ahmad Shah Massoud's closest friends, ran as an independent candidate in the 2009 Afghan presidential election and came in second place. On November 1, 2009, Abdullah, however, quit the runoff election because of widespread allegations of election fraud. Some of his followers wanted to take to the streets but Abdullah called for calm. Massoud Khalili, another of Ahmad Shah Massoud's close friends, became ambassador to India and subsequently to Turkey, while the younger brother of Massoud, Ahmad Wali Massoud, serves as ambassador to the United Kingdom. Massoud's ex-commander Bismillah Khan Mohammadi was chief- of-staff of the Afghan National Army, then as Minister of the Interior followed by Minister of Defense. One of Massoud's close intelligence agents, Amrullah Saleh, became director of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) in 2004 but had to resign in 2010. =Reformation (2011)= The National Front of Afghanistan, which was created by Ahmad Zia Massoud, Abdul Rashid Dostum and Mohammad Mohaqiq in late 2011 to oppose peace talks with Taliban, is generally considered as a reformation of the military wing of the United Front. Meanwhile, much of the political wing has reunited under the National Coalition of Afghanistan led by Abdullah Abdullah. Former head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Amrullah Saleh, has created a new movement, Basej-i Milli, with support among the youth. It mobilized about 10,000 people in an anti-Taliban demonstration in the capital Kabul in May 2011. Former Northern Alliance strongman Mohammed Fahim, Vice President of Afghanistan, remained in an alliance with Hamid Karzai until Fahim's death in 2014. Human rights issues (1996‚Äì2001) The human rights situation during combat was heavily dependent on the specific commander and his troops. The situation for different leaders and their troops of the United Front thus shows sharp contrasts. Also, the quality of life of the Afghan population was heavily dependent on the specific leader that was directly controlling the area in which they lived. Sharp contrasts could also be witnessed regarding life and structures in those areas. =Area of Ahmad Shah Massoud= Ahmad Shah Massoud controlled the Panjshir area, some other parts of Parwan and Thakhar province. Some parts of Badakshan were under his influence while others were controlled by Burhanuddin Rabbani. Badakshan was the home region of Rabbani. Massoud created institutions which were structured into several committees: political, health, education and economic. In the area of Massoud women and girls were allowed to work and to go to school, and in at least two known instances Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage. Women also did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. While it was Massoud's stated conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion that could only be achieved through education. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans fled from the Taliban to the areas controlled by Massoud. There was a huge humanitarian problem as there was not enough to eat for both the existing population and the internally displaced Afghans. In 2001, Massoud and a French journalist described the bitter situation of the displaced people and asked for humanitarian help. =Area of Abdul Rashid Dostum= Northern Alliance troops under General Dostum's command in Mazar-e Sharif, December 2001 Until the conquest of Balkh by the Taliban in 1998, Abdul Rashid Dostum controlled the following provinces: Samangan, Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab, and Baghlan provinces. According to Human Rights Watch many of the violations of international humanitarian law committed by the United Front forces date from 1996‚Äì1998 when Dostum controlled most of the north. According to Human Rights Watch in 1997, some 3,000 captured Taliban soldiers were summarily executed in and around Mazar-i Sharif by Dostum's Junbish-i Milli forces under the command of Abdul Malik Pahlawan. The killings followed Malik's withdrawal from a brief alliance with the Taliban and the capture of the Taliban forces who were trapped in the city. With the U.S. War on Terror, troops loyal to Dostum also returned to combat. In December 2001, during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, between 250 and 3,000 (depending on sources) Taliban prisoners were shot and/or suffocated to death in metal truck containers. The prisoners were killed while being transferred from Kunduz to Sheberghan. This became known as the Dasht-i-Leili massacre In 2009, Dostum denied the accusations. Dostum belonged to those commanders making their own, often draconian, laws. Human Rights Watch has released documents alleging widespread crimes targeted against the civilian population. Human Rights Watch asked to actively discourage and refuse support in any way to any group or coalition that includes commanders with a record of serious violations of international humanitarian law standards, specifically naming Abdul Rashid Dostum; Muhammad Mohaqiq, a senior commander of the Hezb-e Wahdat; Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the erstwhile Ittehad-e Islami; and Abdul Malik Pahlawan, a former senior Junbish-i Milli commander.

He was the only coach in NCAA history to take three separate schools to the NCAA Tournament in his first year coaching the teams. In 21 years as a collegiate coach, he made 18 postseason appearances. Previously, he coached Xavier University for seven seasons, where he achieved great success. He spent his first year of coaching at the collegiate level at Loyola College in Maryland, where he took the Greyhounds to the team's first modern-day NCAA Tournament appearance. Prosser was the Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year in 2003. Early life Prosser was born and raised in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania suburb of Carnegie and graduated from Carnegie High School, where he played football and basketball. He played basketball and rugby union at the United States Merchant Marine Academy where he earned a degree in nautical science in 1972. Prosser coached at Linsly Military Institute in Wheeling, West Virginia, where he achieved a 38‚Äì9 record. He then was hired as a history teacher at Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he coached his teams to a state championship in 1982, five regional championships and three conference titles over a period of six years and a record of 104‚Äì48. Prosser would say later in his career that he would be happy if he were still teaching and coaching at Central Catholic High. One of the players on his championship team was Doug Wojcik, former head coach at the College of Charleston. Prosser earned his master's degree in secondary education from West Virginia University while he taught at Wheeling Central. Coaching Prosser coached 15 seasons as head coach at the collegiate level. He began his college coaching career when he was hired by Coach Pete Gillen as an assistant coach for eight seasons at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, starting with the 1985‚Äì86 season, and he became Gillen's top assistant. His collegiate head coaching career began at Loyola College in Maryland on April 1, 1993. Besides replacing Tom Schneider who had resigned in the midst of a then-school-worst 2-25 season, Prosser inherited a program that had completed its sixth straight losing campaign.McMullen, Paul. \\"Loyola hires Xavier aide for basketball,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Thursday, April 1, 1993. In his only season at Loyola, the Greyhounds finished with a 17-13 overall record and won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championship to earn its first-ever NCAA Division I Tournament berth. He returned to Xavier exactly one year later on April 1, 1994 to succeed Gillen who had accepted a similar position at Providence College two days prior.Lambrecht, Gary. \\"NCAA TOURNAMENT: Prosser leaves Loyola, heads back to Xavier,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Friday, April 1, 1994. Prosser became the second-winningest coach in Xavier history after Gillen. Prosser began his career at Wake Forest in 2001 and led the Demon Deacons to the NCAA tournament in each of his first four years there. Prosser is credited for sparking participation in the Wake Forest student Screamin' Demons and increasing attendance with game-time antics, like having the Demon Deacon mascot enter Lawrence Joel on a Harley Davidson and filling the coliseum with Zombie Nation's \\"Kernkraft 400\\" at tip-off and when the Deacons would go on a run. During Prosser's tenure as head coach, home season tickets sold out for the first time ever in 2004. During the 2004‚Äì05 season, the team was ranked #1 by the Associated Press for the first time in the school's history and won a school-record 27 games. At Wake Forest, Prosser won 100 games faster than all but two ACC coaches. In 2003, his Demon Deacons squad became the first from the ACC to ever lead the nation in rebounding. In the summer of 2007, Prosser had organized what was said to be a top-five recruiting class for the upcoming year. Prosser was the collegiate coach of current or former NBA players Aaron Williams, James Posey, David West, Josh Howard, Darius Songaila and Chris Paul; he won national recruiting wars for Paul and Eric Williams. He amassed a career record of 291‚Äì146 (.666).Veteran Wake Forest coach Prosser dies at 56 - Men's College Basketball - ESPN Every senior whom Prosser coached earned his degree in four years. =Coaching style= His teams were known for their fast tempo and offensive explosiveness. During his last two troubling seasons, he would quote Thomas Paine, Henry David Thoreau, Friedrich Nietzsche or William Shakespeare to his players to inspire them. The spring semester prior to summer exhibition tours, Prosser would require that every member of his team take a one-credit class on the history of the place they would be visiting. He would also attend the class and write the required term paper. Personal life Prosser and his wife Nancy met in Cincinnati. He had two sons, Scott and Mark, who are from his first marriage to Ruth Charles. Mark was formerly the head coach at Division II Brevard College, served as an assistant coach at Winthrop University, and is now head coach at Western Carolina. An avid sports fan, Prosser was a follower of the Pittsburgh Steelers since childhood and would often find sports bars to watch their games while on the road. He was at Three Rivers Stadium to witness the Immaculate Reception. He also saw Roberto Clemente's 3,000th and final hit, and the last game ever played at Three Rivers Stadium. He once hitchhiked across the country. Prosser earned a reputation in college basketball for a keen intellect and sense of humor. He enjoyed reading the books of Robert Ludlum, along with biographies and books on history, philosophy and politics. The athletic director at Loyola, Joe Boylan, said that Prosser was a \\"renaissance man coaching basketball.\\" Former Xavier player Dwayne Wilson said, \\"He always liked to read history books, so he was always quoting something‚Äîwhether it be Winston Churchill or another great author‚Äîhe was always quoting somebody on something.\\" Prosser stated, in an interview that aired just after his death, that his favorite quote was from Ralph Waldo Emerson: \\"He was a transcendentalist in America in the 1830s who said 'Our chief want in life is someone who will make us do what we can.' I thought that was a powerful statement that we need to be around people who challenge us to be as good as we can be.\\" Since 2009, Prosser's legacy has been celebrated in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with the annual READ Challenge as part of the Skip Prosser Literacy Program. The READ Challenge, a collaboration between Wake Forest Athletics and the Wake Forest Department of Education with support from the Winston-Salem based literary nonprofit Bookmarks, encourages and supports reading among fourth-grade students in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools. In the fall of 2019, a total of 1,441 fourth graders from 29 elementary schools participated in the READ Challenge. 903 fourth-graders read 1500 or more minutes before winter break, the highest participation total since 2014. Death On July 26, 2007, Prosser collapsed in his office around noon after jogging at the Kentner Stadium track adjacent to his office in the Manchester Athletic Center on Wake Forest's campus. A staff member found him unresponsive around 12:45 pm; medical personnel performed CPR and used a defibrillator in efforts to revive Prosser. He was rushed to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:41 pm from an apparent \\"sudden massive heart attack\\". He was 56 years old. The announcement of Prosser's death was delayed until later in the day because his wife was traveling to Cincinnati and had not yet been reached. Players were gathered and taken to an off-campus location without their cell phones to guard them from reports of Prosser's death. Prosser ate lunch the previous day with his predecessor as Wake Forest coach, then University of South Carolina coach Dave Odom. Prosser then ate dinner with his son Mark, who was also in Florida recruiting, before flying to North Carolina Thursday morning. Two funeral masses were held for Prosser. The first was on July 31, 2007 at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Clemmons, North Carolina, near the Wake Forest campus (due to seating limitations, this service was televised by closed circuit television to Wait Chapel on campus).

Wrack (born 23 May 1962) is a British trade unionist and former firefighter. He was elected General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) in May 2005. Politics Wrack joined the Labour Party Young Socialists in Salford in 1978 and was a member of Farnworth Constituency Labour Party during the period in which the local MP John Roper left Labour to join the Social Democratic Party. Wrack subsequently moved to London, working for a time in the DHSS before joining the fire service. Wrack was active in the Labour Party Young Socialists before going on to join the Socialist Party, which he had left by the time he was elected to lead the FBU in 2005. His union disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 2004 but reaffiliated in November 2015. In March 2016, he rejoined Labour Party. In September 2017, he was listed at Number 87 in 'The 100 Most Influential People on the Left'. Service in the London Fire Brigade Wrack joined the London Fire Brigade in 1983. He was initially posted to Silvertown Fire Station in the east London borough of Newham, which was closed during a round of cuts in 2014. in 1988 he transferred to Kingsland fire station in Hackney where he spent most of his fire service career on the green watch. Kingsland Fire Station was also closed during the cuts of 2014 and Wrack attended the protest at the closure. Wrack held various positions in the Fire Brigades Union at branch, area and regional level. He worked with Mick Shaw on the North East London Area Committee where both became at various stages secretary and chair. Shaw went on to become the FBU President. Gillender Street Fire In July 1991, whilst North East London Area Secretary of the FBU, Wrack attended the fatal fire at Gillender Street at which two firefighters, Terry Hunt and David Stokoe were killed. Wrack had previously worked with Hunt. Matt Wrack and the then FBU London Regional Secretary (later MP) Jim Fitzpatrick, investigated the incident and produced the FBU report. The London Fire Brigade was later served with two improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive. Organising in the FBU Wrack was involved in various rank and file and left wing groupings within the FBU, including the Fire Brigades Broad Left (FBBL) which also involved the then union president, Ronnie Scott. The FBBL emerged with the background of the 1984/85 miners strike and during campaigns against the abolition of metropolitan county councils by the then Conservative government. The FBBL produced the bulletin Guideline between 1984 and 1989. Between 1991 and 1995, Wrack helped produce and edit Flame, a bulletin of Militant supporters within the fire service. Homerton 11 In early 2000, Wrack was closely involved in the campaign around the FBU Homerton 11, eleven members who were suspended from work and disciplined by the London Fire Brigade management. The campaign by the FBU involved representation at the disciplinary cases and a workplace campaign to organise opposition and prepare for industrial action. Wrack and Andy Dark (current FBU Assistant General Secretary) acted as the principal disciplinary representatives whilst also working to build the wider campaign. Despite initial threats of dismissal, none of the eleven was dismissed and the campaign proved a turning point for the FBU in London in advance of the 2002/3 pay dispute.http://www.fbu.me.uk/newspress/ffmag/2000/0700/ffjul00.pdf 2002/03 fire service pay dispute and election as general secretary Wrack was the FBU London Regional Organiser during the 2002/3 industrial dispute over pay. He became a leading critic of the strategy followed by the FBU leadership at the time. After being elected London Regional Secretary in 2004, he was elected Assistant General Secretary in 2005. Wrack then defeated incumbent General Secretary Andy Gilchrist on 5 May 2005 after Gilchrist had served one five- year term. This followed widespread discontent over the settlement reached by Gilchrist with the government that ended the 2002-03 pay dispute. The election was marred by ill feeling arising from the recent strikes. Wrack won 63.9% (12,883 votes) of the vote. Wrack stood for re-election in 2010 and was challenged by John McGhee, a longstanding ally of former general secretary Andy Gilchrist. Wrack was re-elected. He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress in 2006 and has been re-elected since. He was subsequently elected onto the TUC executive committee. He was returned unopposed for a third term as FBU general secretary in 2014. Strikes over fire service 'modernisation' In the years following Wrack's election the FBU saw an unprecedented number of local disputes as employers embarked on various ‚Äòmodernisation‚Äô schemes which saw changes to shift systems and cuts to jobs number in local fire and rescue services. These included strikes in Suffolk, West Midlands, and Hertfordshire. The Hertfordshire dispute saw the decision of the Labour government to provide no military cover during industrial action, a decision which would have significant impact on future fire service industrial disputes. Strike action in Merseyside in 2006 led to an accusation from the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) that the union was pursuing a political agenda in an attempt to disrupt ‚Äòmodernisation‚Äô. In 2009 South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service threatened to dismiss and re-employ the workforce in order to impose non-agreed shift arrangements. This led to a further strike. The same threat of dismissal and re-employment to impose shift changes also led to strikes in London in 2010. The campaign included some large-scale protests and confrontations with strike-breakers, including incidents in which two FBU members were injured. Pensions dispute with the coalition government The general election of 2010 saw the creation of the coalition government. A central plank of its programme was the introduction of changes to public sector pensions. The FBU developed a campaign focused both on issues of fairness but also arguments around the needs of firefighting as an occupation and, in particular, the physical fitness standards which were required as a result.http://www.fbu.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/04/9217-FBU-Pension-Bulletin-no-9-March-13LR.pdf The FBU balloted members in 2013 and a 78% Yes vote was returned for strike action. The subsequent dispute was the longest in the history of the FBU. The campaign resulted in Parliamentary debate in December 2014, after the Labour front bench agreed to support a challenge to the new firefighter pension regulations.http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2014-15/454 Following the loss of the vote in Parliament, the FBU called a further strike in February 2015. This was accompanied by a mass rally which saw Parliament Square and Downing Street taken over by the protesters. The FBU held a recall Conference to debate options. No further strike action was called. After the election of the Conservative government in May 2015 the FBU launched a legal challenge over the changes, alleging age discrimination in the way ‚Äòtransitional protection‚Äô arrangements were introduced. Fire and rescue service campaigns and major incidents In 2008, Wrack launched a new report for the FBU on firefighter deaths in the line of duty. This was accompanied by a lobby of Parliament. This was followed by a series of reports addressing challenges facing the fire and rescue service. These included reports into attacks on firefighters,http://www.fbu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/3839-FBU- Attacks-Low-res.pdf floods (2007 and 2015),http://www.fbu.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2010/12/4166-FBU-Floods-LOW-RES.pdf and on the fire service role in relation to climate change. The FBU also challenged what it claimed to be a simplistic cost base approach of the Audit Commission to fire service matters. The FBU also challenged the drift toward increasing emergency response times across UK fire and rescue services.http://www.fbu.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2010/11/6367-Its-about-time-LOW-RES2.pdf Through these, Wrack and the FBU argued that the shift towards ‚Äòlocalism‚Äô and the ending of national standards and inspection were creating an increasingly fragmented fire and rescue service. This was an issue Wrack had addressed in a 2008 lecture to the Centre for Research in Employment Studies at the University of Hertfordshire.https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/2696/S103.pdf?sequence=1 In December 2006 an explosion and fire took place at a fireworks storage facility at Marlie Farm in East Sussex. Two employees of East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service were killed and a number injured. The FBU launched cases for compensation on behalf of the family of one of the deceased, Brian Wembridge, and on behalf of the injured firefighters. Despite losing the case in court, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service continued to refuse payment of compensation and appealed against the decision. Wrack condemned this move and the FBU launched a campaign for the appeal to be dropped and compensation paid in relation to those killed or injured at the incident. Austerity, cuts and public ownership Wrack has participated in the various campaigns against austerity since the election of the coalition government at the 2010 general election. While much of the left has focused on tax avoidance, Wrack has argued for an approach which also addresses issues of ownership of the economy. The FBU published pamphlets on public ownership of the banks and public ownership of the energy companies. Wrack successfully moved a motion at the TUC in 2012 calling for public ownership of the banks and financial services sector, the first time such a motion had been carried by the TUC in its history. Climate change Wrack spoke at the 2008 Campaign for Climate Change trade union conference and at the Time to Act demonstration on climate change in March 2015. Wrack led the FBUs response to the 2007 and 2013-14 floods, calling for a statutory duty on the FRS in England and Wales on flooding. Wrack commissioned two FBU reports on flooding in 2008 (for the Pitt Review) and in 2014 as well as the union's own climate change report in 2010. Salary and Solidarity fund Wrack pledged prior to election to take a salary \\"based on average earnings of FBU members\\". The salary of the FBU general secretary is set by the union's executive council and endorsed by the union's conference. It is based on a direct link to an Area Manager within the fire and rescue service, so that any pay rises reflect those agreed on behalf of FBU members. In order to meet his election pledge, Wrack has set aside a portion of his salary and placed it into a separate fund which is used to support trade union and labour movement campaigns, hardship funds, initiatives in the UK and around the world. Wrack was interviewed about his stance on his salary for a BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2015. Personal life Wrack was born in Manchester but has lived in east London since 1981. He lives in Leytonstone, East London with his wife, Sheila Wrack. They have four grown up children.

Usually, the term is used to refer to reversal of lanes which are normally configured for travel in one direction; routinely changing the configuration of reversible lanes (such as during rush hour) is not normally considered contraflow lane reversal. Emergency evacuation In an emergency evacuation, contraflow lane reversal roughly doubles the number of lanes available for evacuation traffic. Crossover sections are used to move outgoing traffic to these lanes. All incoming traffic is blocked until the end of the evacuation. Contraflow lane reversal is usually done on freeways and other controlled-access roadways; however, some examples listed below (particularly in South Carolina) are divided and undivided roadways. Use of contraflow lane reversal is generally considered to be an emergency measure, as the contraflow lanes (and any associated ramps at interchanges) lack proper signage, signals, and other traffic control devices needed to orderly conduct traffic in the opposite direction. Generally, a significant number of police officers or other officials are needed to manually direct traffic during a lane reversal (especially at interchanges, where ramp traffic in the wrong direction must intersect with other roadways that are operating normally). =Hurricane evacuation= Hurricane evacuation route marking near the Texas Gulf Coast From the 1990s, many states in the Southeastern United States adopted hurricane evacuation routes from coastal areas using contraflow lane reversals on Interstate Highways. State highway departments have coordinated on plans for traffic direction with state highway patrol agencies, constructed highway median crossovers, and installed signage for drivers and barriers and swing arms to inhibit wrong-way collisions. Most evacuation plans involve only a single state; however, the states of Louisiana and Mississippi have developed coordinated plans to evacuate the New Orleans metropolitan area by using Interstate 55 and Interstate 59. Current contraflow evacuation plans exist for: * Alabama ** Mobile via I-65 Modular Jersey barriers are semi-permanently installed as a median barrier between the left and second-from-left bridges, along Interstate 4 near Tampa. They can be quickly removed to allow some eastbound traffic to transfer to the westbound lanes when contraflow is enacted. * Florida (While the following contraflow plans exist, at the beginning of the 2017 hurricane season, Florida launched an emergency shoulder use scheme for hurricane evacuations along portions of I-4, I-10, & I-75. It is not clear if the contraflow plans on these sections of highway will remain updated or will be scrapped. In the days before Hurricane Irma, officials chose to implement emergency shoulder use on sections of I-4 & I-75 rather than contraflow.) ** Jacksonville, via I-10 ** Pensacola, via I-10 (eastbound) ** South Florida (Miami/Fort Lauderdale), via Florida's Turnpike and Alligator Alley ** Southwest Florida, via I-75 ** The Space Coast, via SR 528 ** Tampa Bay, via I-4 Crossing gates at the interchange between Interstate 16 and Interstate 95, used to prevent westbound access to I-16 during contraflow, Pooler, GA * Georgia ** Savannah, via I-16 * Louisiana ** Lafayette, via I-49 ** Lake Charles, via I-10 and I-210 ** New Orleans metropolitan area, via I-10, I-12, I-55, I-59, and the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway * Maryland ** Ocean City, via US 50 and Maryland Route 90 * Massachusetts ** Cape Cod via US-6, Route 3, and Route 28Cape Cod Emergency Traffic Plan, Massachusetts Department of Transportation, retrieved June 10, 2016 * Mississippi ** Mississippi Gulf Coast, via I-59 and US-49http://www.mdot.state.ms.us/Home/EmergencyPreparedness/pdf/ContraflowPlan.pdf ** New Orleans metropolitan area, via I-55 * New Jersey ** Jersey Shore, via Route 47/Route 347, Garden State Parkway, Atlantic City Expressway, Route 72/Route 70, Route 35, and Route 138/I-195 * South Carolina ** Beaufort, via U.S. 21 ** Charleston, via I-26 ** Georgetown County, via U.S. 17 ** The Grand Strand, via U.S. 501 ** Hilton Head Island, via U.S. 278 * Texas ** Corpus Christi, via I-37 ** Houston, via I-10, I-45, I-69 (U.S. Highway 59), and U.S. 290 ** Freeport, Surfside Beach, and Lake Jackson via SH 288 and SH 36. ** Rio Grande Valley, via I-2 (U.S. Highway 83) from Harlingen to McAllen, I-69E (U.S. Highway 77) from Brownsville to Harlingen, I-69C (U.S. Highway 281) from Pharr to Falfurrias * Virginia ** The Hampton Roads area, via I-64 Highway reconstruction When roads are undergoing construction amid heavy traffic, one lane of traffic may be blocked and another lane reversed. =Single track roads= Single track roads are often closed during reconstruction. =Two- lane arterials= Traffic controllers direct traffic through half of a roundabout with STOP / SLOW signs, using contraflow conditions A construction worker or police officer directs traffic with a \\"Stop/Slow Paddle\\", which is a sign displaying \\"STOP\\" on one side and \\"SLOW\\" on the other. The sign is turned, and the other side proceeds. Traffic signals are also sometimes used, especially during bridge construction or any situation in which a lane must be closed during times when construction crews are not at work. Other cases include treating the street as a temporary one-way street in areas in which several nearby parallel streets are available as a detour for the opposing side. =Roads with four or more lanes= If road construction necessitates the complete closure of one half of a road with four or more lanes, two lanes of traffic may be shifted to the other roadway. If the road being constructed is a highway, the used half is called a semi-highway. =Freeways and motorways= When controlled-access highways undergo reconstruction, both sides are often reduced to one lane. In some cases, traffic may be shifted onto one half, making it a temporary two-lane freeway corridor. An example of this is Interstate 10 in Arizona, in which eastbound traffic is reduced to one lane and shifted onto the westbound half of the road. Another technique is to treat the rightmost hard shoulder as a travel lane. On a six-lane freeway (i.e., one containing three lanes in each direction), a third lane may be kept open for the busier direction, or the shoulder may be opened to allow for four lanes of traffic but with little or no shoulder space; emergency breakdown areas may be added. In these situations, temporary \\"YIELD\\" or \\"STOP\\" signs are usually posted on merge ramps on freeways, expressways, and uncontrolled roads with interchanges. In such cases, opposing directions are separated by jersey barriers, or in rare circumstances, traffic cones. Sporting events At the beginning and end of major sporting events, the center turn lanes of roads around a stadium or arena may be used to accommodate event traffic. Because these lanes are typically not subject to lane control, this can be considered a limited form of contraflow reversal. I-93 in Concord, New Hampshire after completion of a NASCAR race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, looking south. Once a year, upon completion of NASCAR races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, New Hampshire, a form of contraflow lane reversal, referred to as \\"borrow a lane\\" is conducted on Interstate 93 in Concord, New Hampshire. In this case, the left lane of northbound Interstate 93 is temporarily \\"borrowed\\" to use as a third southbound lane. Southbound traffic has the option of transferring to the \\"borrowed\\" lane north of the Interstate 393 interchange and can travel southbound in the left northbound lane to allow a bypass of heavy race traffic entering I-93 southbound from I-393 at Exit 15. The two lanes of traffic in the normal southbound lanes, and traffic in the bypass \\"borrowed\\" lane rejoin on the southbound side of the interstate just south of the Interstate 89 interchange in Bow. Contraflow lane reversal is also used for Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series races at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. For these races, two-lane Pennsylvania Route 115 becomes one-way southbound between Interstate 80 and the track the morning of the race until everyone has arrived at the track. After the race concludes, PA 115 becomes one-way northbound between Pocono Raceway and I-80 until everyone has left the track.

Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, Gallucci met Modest Mouse‚Äôs Isaac Brock in Seattle, Washington in 1993, playing guitar with the band intermittently before joining full-time to record several singles that would eventually appear on the album Sad Sappy Sucker, released by independent record label K Records in 2001. While in Modest Mouse, Gallucci co-founded the punk bands Area 51 and Death Wish Kids, featuring members that would go on to form The Murder City Devils. Area 51 recorded one single with Nation of Ulysses‚Äô Tim Green, and Death Wish Kids would record two singles before disbanding. The Murder City Devils formed in 1996, consisting of members Spencer Moody, Dann Gallucci, Derek Fudesco, Coady Willis and Nate Manny. That year, the band released two singles, Three Natural Sixes (Hopscotch Records #5) and Dance Hall Music (Empty Records MTR-354), and signed with the Die Young Stay Pretty label, a subsidiary of Sub Pop. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1997. In 1996, Gallucci co-wrote and played guitar on the Modest Mouse songs ‚ÄúTrailer Trash‚Äù and ‚ÄúBankrupt on Selling,‚Äù which appeared on the album The Lonesome Crowded West, released by Up Records in 1997. Pitchfork Media ranked \\"Trailer Trash\\" #63 in their list ‚ÄúThe Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s.‚Äù In 1998, The Murder City Devils released their second full-length album, Empty Bottles, Broken Hearts. The album saw an increased use of electric organ, and that same year they recruited Leslie Hardy as their full-time keyboard player. To support the record, the band embarked on a yearlong North American tour, playing with At the Drive-In, Pearl Jam, and Built to Spill. After a short break, the band released their third full-length album In Name and Blood in 2000 followed by the Thelema EP in 2001. Keyboardist Leslie Hardy left the band mid-tour and was replaced by Nick Dewitt for their final concerts. The band's farewell concert on October 31, 2001 at Seattle's Showbox Theater was recorded and released by Sub Pop in 2003, titled R.I.P. and included two previously unrecorded songs. It was also released on DVD in 2005. After the breakup of The Murder City Devils, Gallucci returned to Modest Mouse full-time from 2001 to 2005, co-writing and playing on the band‚Äôs fourth full-length album, Good News for People Who Love Bad News, released by Epic April 6, 2004. In addition to guitar, Gallucci played Mellotron, keyboards, piano, Glockenspiel, drum loops, timpani, and percussion. The first two singles from the album were \\"Float On\\" and \\"Ocean Breathes Salty,\\" both of which debuted on American radio stations in the first half of 2004. The album was released to widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album five out of five stars, saying, \\"Ultimately, what makes Good News so successful is that it retains the melancholy mood of past works, while at the same time adding depth and maturity.\\"Tiny Mix Tapes Review Spin gave it an A and said it was \\"Half expansive, burnished radio-rock, half swampy Delta hoodoo-hollerin' that reeks of Brock's Southern sojourn.\\" Filter gave it a score of 92% and said that it would soon be \\"one of the best albums of 2004\\". Billboard' gave it a favorable review and called it \\"a daring yet accessible disc\\". The New York Times also gave it a favorable review and called it \\"the best Modest Mouse album yet.\\" It was Planet Sound's #1 Album of 2004. It was also nominated for a Grammy in 2005 for Best Alternative Album. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in August 2004.Searchable Database Retrieved 22 November 2011. Note: User must define 'Artist' search parameter as \\"Modest Mouse\\". As of March 19, 2007, it had sold 1,509,675 copies in the United States. In 2003, Gallucci formed the band A Gun Called Tension with Sean Reveron of The Beta Band, Exodus 77, and The Free Association. A mix of dancehall, hip hop, reggae and punk, the band released a self-titled album on Cold Crush in 2003. Gallucci left Modest Mouse in 2005 to pursue a career in audio engineering and production. Graduating from The Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences in Phoenix, AZ in 2007, he spent a year and a half working at Seattle‚Äôs Avast! Studios, where he assisted producer Phil Ek on several records. In addition, he worked on releases by the bands Triumph of Lethargy and Past Lives. In order to round out his audio engineering skills, Gallucci began touring as a live sound engineer. In 2008, he worked as monitor engineer for M.I.A., and from 2009 to 2011 he worked as front of house engineer for Cold War Kids, Miike Snow, The xx, and Warpaint. In 2011, Gallucci recorded the single ‚ÄúFashionable‚Äù for Cold War Kids, joining the band later that year to play guitar and produce their next record. In preparation, Gallucci and the band decided to build their San Pedro rehearsal space into a studio. Gallucci produced, engineered, and played on the album, while sharing mixing duties with Lars Stalfors. Dear Miss Lonely Hearts was released April 2, 2013 on Downtown Records, debuting at number 51 on the Billboard 200. The single \\"Miracle Mile\\" reached #22 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, giving Cold War Kids at that point the highest charting single of their career. Critics saw the album as a return to form for the band. Heather Phares of AllMusic felt the record played to the group's strengths: \\"Dear Miss Lonelyhearts is more about what the band does best rather than breaking new ground, and the result is some of Cold War Kids' most promising and satisfying music since their debut.\\" On October 21, 2014, Cold War Kids released their fifth full-length album, Hold My Home on Downtown Records. Again, Gallucci produced, engineered, and played on the record and co-mixed with Lars Stalfors. Hold My Home spawned two singles: \\"All This Could Be Yours\\" and \\"First\\", which became the band‚Äôs new highest charting single, spending two months at number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, over six months in the top five, and over eight months in the top ten. AllMusic's Heather Phares praised the production throughout the album, calling it the band's best work since Robbers & Cowards, concluding that, \\"with 'Hold My Home', they emerge as a more straightforward band, and also a more confident and engaging one.\\" Philip Cosores of Paste credited new members Gallucci and Plummer for raising the album's taste level over the previous two records and giving the band a whole new identity. Before leaving Cold War Kids in 2016, Gallucci produced, engineered, mixed (with Lars Stalfors), and played on the albums Dear Miss Lonelyhearts and Hold My Home, as well as the EPs Tuxedos, Five Quick Cuts, and A Million Eyes. From 2011 to 2014, Gallucci would return to Modest Mouse on an intermittent basis, eventually co-writing three songs on their album Strangers to Ourselves. Additionally, Gallucci played on recording sessions with Modest Mouse and OutKast‚Äôs Big Boi at the rapper‚Äôs Stankonia Studios in Atlanta, GA. In 2016, Gallucci became the producer of the public radio show Bullseye with Jesse Thorn.

The station has a commercial-free news/talk radio format and is the flagship station of the Ici Radio-Canada Premi√®re network for Atlantic Canada. CBAF is owned and operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBAF was launched in 1954, the first French-language radio station for the Moncton area at 1300 kHz. In 1980, the station was granted a rebroadcaster on FM at 88.5 MHz, to offset AM radio reception problems in the Moncton area. The CBC operated both transmitters until 1988, when the AM transmitter signed off and the FM transmitter became the station's primary frequency.Decision CRTC 87-569 History The construction of a new CBC station in Moncton was started in 1953 at an expected cost of $450,000. CBAF went on the air on February 20, 1954. Studios and offices were then located at St. George Street in the former Assomption Building, a four-storey structure built in 1955 by the Soci√©t√© l'Assomption (the former Assomption Building is not the current Place Assomption on Main Street in Moncton). Today known as the Maison Commerce House, it overlooks St. George and Archibald Streets. The premiere French-language radio station for the Atlantic region, CBAF offered programming from the CBC's French-language network headquarters in Montreal, Quebec. In 1957, CBAF had a radiated power of 5,000 watts and used a single directional antenna pattern. The transmitter was located in the nearby village of Saint Anselme. In 1968, a regional French-language production centre was set up at the Moncton studios. In 1970, CBAF with its Radio-Canada television station CBAFT, and the CBC English-language counterpart CBA relocated to their new studios and offices on Archibald Street (today known as University Avenue) beside the H√¥tel-Dieu de l'Assomption Hospital, which was renamed the Dr. Georges-L. Dumont Regional Hospital by the Government of New Brunswick in 1967. April 10, 1980 saw an FM rebroadcaster at Moncton (CBAF-26-FM) on 88.5 MHz to duplicate the programming of CBAF. The duplicate channel was needed in order to offset severe night-time coverage deficiencies of the AM signal and to improve the reception of the station in outlying areas. CBAF was to have gone silent by November 1, 1985 but the CBC kept it going until the plug was finally pulled in 1988. In the end, CBAF operated on 1300 kHz with a power of 5,000 watts (single directional pattern). CBAF-26-FM operated on 88.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50,000 watts. The FM repeater became CBAF-FM, following the closure of the AM signal. The Radio-Canada network was renamed \\"Premi√®re Cha√Æne\\" on September 1, 1997, later becoming \\"Ici Radio-Canada Premi√®re\\" in August 2013. Rebroadcasters 1 On July 25, 2013, the CBC filed and application to the CRTC to convert CBAF-21 1230 to 91.1 FM;2013-1065-6 this was approved January 10, 2014.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-9, CBAF-FM Moncton ‚Äì New transmitters in Saint-Quentin and Kedgwick , \\"\\"CRTC\\"\\", January 10, 2014 On August 15, 2013, the CBC filed and application to the CRTC to convert CBAF-20 990 to 98.1 FM.2013-1151-3 this was approved January 10, 2014. =Former rebroadcasters= CBAF-FM-5 in Halifax and CBAF-FM-15 in Charlottetown were once satellites of CBAF, but are now stations in their own right despite retaining rebroadcaster-like callsigns.

It is in Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington.  Description  At high Mount Deception is the second highest peak of the Olympic Mountains, after Mount Olympus. It is the highest peak of the eastern Olympics. Mount Deception's prominence is , making it the 17th most prominent peak in Washington. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Olympus at to the west. Mount Deception is located in the northeast portion of the Olympics Mountains just northeast of Mount Mystery between Deception Creek and Royal Creek. The region is known as Royal Basin and includes the upper reaches of Royal Creek. Mount Deception lies at the head of Royal Basin. This location puts it in the rain shadow of the Olympics, resulting in far less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. Although Mount Deception is the highest peak in the eastern Olympics, it is not visible from Seattle. Sunrise on Mount Deception as seen from Marmot Pass Radiating northward from the shoulders of Mount Deception are Gilhooley Tower, The Needles, Mount Clark (), Mount Walkinshaw (), and the northeasterly running spur known as Gray Wolf Ridge. To the east and south are Mount Fricaba, Hal Foss Peak, Mount Mystery, and Little Mystery. Two small glaciers hug the mountain's north-facing basalt slopes.USGS topographic maps Mount Deception sits on the boundary between the drainage basins of the Dungeness River, to the north, and the Dosewallips River, to the south and east. Deception Creek, a tributary of the Dosewallips River, drains the southern slope of Mount Deception. Gray Wolf Pass is located about west of Mount Deception. The pass connects the Dungeness and Dosewallips drainage basins.  History  Mount Deception had been given the name Mount Holmes by the Seattle Press Expedition in honor of John H. Holmes of the Boston Herald. Later, G.A. Whitehead of the U.S. Forest Service renamed it Mount Deception due to the difficulty mountaineers had in locating climbing routes on the often cloud-covered peak. Recreation Martin Peak centered Unlike the peaks of Gray Wolf Ridge, which are scalable for fit and determined day hikers, mountaineering skills are necessary for Mount Deception itself. While not a particularly technical climb, it is steep and exposed. If a climber falls and does not arrest immediately, loose rock and rotten snow may make it difficult to stop falling for some distance. Fatalities have occurred on Mount Deception and the National Park Service recommends climbers be experienced in self-arrest skills, rock climbing, and route-finding. The adjacent Needles are typically regarded as providing better, and somewhat more difficult, mountaineering objectives in the Royal Basin area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Deception is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are June through September. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion caused by glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

It describes a person who sees two pairs of footprints in the sand, one of which belonged to God and another to him or herself. At some points the two pairs of footprints dwindle to one; it is explained that this is where God carried the protagonist. Content This popular text is based in Christian beliefs and describes an experience in which a person is walking on a beach with God. They leave two sets of footprints in the sand. The tracks represent stages of the speaker's life. The two trails dwindle to one, especially at the lowest and most hopeless moments of the person's life. When questioning God, believing that the Lord must have abandoned his love during those times, God gives the explanation, \\"During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.\\" Authorship and origin The authorship of the poem is disputed, with a number of people claiming to have written it. In 2008, Rachel Aviv in a Poetry Foundation article discusses the claims of Burrell Webb, Mary Stevenson, Margaret Fishback Powers, and Carolyn Joyce Carty. Later that year, The Washington Post, covering a lawsuit between the claims of Stevenson, Powers and Carty, said that \\"At least a dozen people\\" had claimed credit for the poem. The three authors who have most strenuously promoted their authorship are Margaret Powers (n√©e Fishback), Carolyn Carty, and Mary Stevenson. Powers says she wrote the poem on Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, in mid-October, 1964. Powers is among the contenders who have resorted to litigation in hopes of establishing a claim. She is occasionally confused with American writer Margaret Fishback. Powers published an autobiography in 1993. Carolyn Carty also claims to have written the poem in 1963 when she was six years old based on an earlier work by her great-great aunt, a Sunday school teacher. She is known to be a hostile contender of the \\"Footprints\\" poem and declines to be interviewed about it, although she writes letters to those who write about the poem online.A collection of poetry by Carty with a claim to authorship of \\"Footprints\\" was published in 2004. Mary Stevenson is also a purported author of the poem circa 1936. A Stevenson biography was published in 1995. =Popular use of phrase= Before its appearance in the 1970s, the phrase \\"footprints in the sand\\" occurred in other works. The most dominant usage in prose is in the context of fictional or nonfiction adventure or mystery stories or articles. Prominent fiction includes Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe and Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story Foot-prints on the Sea-shore published in the Democratic Review. Hawthorne published the story again in Twice-Told Tales and it has been reprinted many times since. A line in the story reads, \\"Thus, by tracking our foot-prints in the sand, we track our own nature in its wayward course, and steal a glance upon it, when it never dreams of being so observed. Such glances always make us wiser.\\" Non- fiction includes the 1926 post-kidnapping discovery of Aimee Semple McPherson in the northern Mexican desert. In the two centuries before 1980, when \\"Footprints\\" entered popular American culture, many books, articles, and sermons appeared with \\"Fooprints in the Sand\\" as a title. Some of them concerned the lives of Christian missionaries. Footprints and Living Songs is an 1883 biography of hymn-writer Frances Ridley Havergal. In 1839, \\"A Psalm of Life\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow contained the lines: ::Lives of great men all remind us ::We can make our lives sublime, ::And, departing, leave behind us ::Footprints on the sands of time. Within a decade, the last phrase of the poem was being used in public discourse without attribution, apparently on the assumption that any literate reader would know its origin. In some usages \\"of time\\" disappeared; later, \\"on\\" seems to become \\"in\\". \\"The Object of a Life\\" (1876) by George Whyte-Melville includes the lines: ::To tell of the great example, the Man of compassion and woe; ::Of footprints left behind Him, in the earthly path He trod, ::And how the lowest may find Him, who straitly walk with God was published in the widely read (and plagiarized) Temple Bar. The lines here are strikingly similar in many respects to those seen in contemporaneous hymn lyrics and later poetry. =Biblical background= Deuteronomy 1:31 presents the concept of \\"God bearing you\\". The 1609 Douay- Rheims Bible Old Testament translation from Latin into English uses the wording, \\"And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.\\" In 1971, the New American Standard Bible used the language \\"and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you\\". Nearly identical wording is used in other late 20th century translations, including the New International Version of 1978. =Possible 19th century origins= May Riley Smith's poem \\"If\\", published without attribution in the Indianapolis Journal in 1869, includes a stanza that describes God's footprints in the sand next to a boy's: ::If I could know those little feet were shod in sandals wrought of light in better lands, ::And that the foot-prints of a tender God ran side by side with his, in golden sands, ::I could bow cheerfully, and kiss the rod, since Benny was in wiser, safer hands. June Hadden Hobbs suggested that the origin of the modern \\"Footprints\\" is in Mary B. C. Slade's 1871 hymn \\"Footsteps of Jesus\\" as \\"almost surely the source of the notion that Jesus's footprints have narrative significance that influences the way believers conduct their life stories...it allows Jesus and a believer to inhabit the same space at the same time...Jesus travels the path of the believer, instead of the other way around.\\" A similar argument could be made for Footprints of Jesus by L. B. Thorpe as published in the 1878 The International Lesson Hymnal. Aviv suggests that the source of the modern \\"Footprints\\" allegory is the opening paragraph of Charles Haddon Spurgeon's 1880 sermon \\"The Education of the Sons of God\\". He wrote: \\"And did you ever walk out upon that lonely desert island upon which you were wrecked, and say, 'I am alone, ‚Äî alone, ‚Äî alone, ‚Äî nobody was ever here before me'? And did you suddenly pull up short as you noticed, in the sand, the footprints of a man? I remember right well passing through that experience; and when I looked, lo! it was not merely the footprints of a man that I saw, but I thought I knew whose feet had left those imprints; they were the marks of One who had been crucified, for there was the print of the nails. So I thought to myself, 'If he has been here, it is a desert island no longer.'\\" In 1883, an American encyclopedia of hymns by female writers included Jetty Vogel, an English poet. Vogel's \\"At the Portal\\" follows someone looking at their footprints as they deviate from the proper path. Vogel's hymn has an angel's footsteps but lacks the \\"I carried you\\" of the modern \\"Footprints\\". In 1892, the Evening Star ran a short story \\"Footprints in the Sand\\" written by Flora Haines Loughead for the Star. The work uses a metaphor for Christ, of a father following footprints in the sand of another's child headed for danger, as he wonders, \\"Why was it that there was nowhere any sign of a larger footprint to guide the little babyish feet?\\" =Possible 20th century origins= In 1918, Mormon publication The Children's Friend re-published the Loughead piece (credited, but misspelled \\"Laughead\\"), ensuring a wider distribution in the western states. Chicago area poet Lucille Veneklasen frequently submitted poems to the Chicago Tribune in the 1940s and 1950s; one entitled \\"Footprints\\" was published in the Tribune in late 1958: ::I walked the road to sorrow‚Äîa road so dark with care, so lonely, I was certain that no one else was there. ::But suddenly around me were beams of light, stretched wide; and then I saw that someone was walking by my side. ::And when I turned to notice this road which I had trod, I saw two sets of footprints‚ÄîMy own... and those of God. Veneklasen's poem appeared occasionally in newspaper obituaries, commonly lacking attribution, and often with the decease substituted for \\"I\\". In 1963 and 1964, the Aiken Standard and Review in South Carolina ran a poem by frequent contributor M. L. Sullivan titled \\"Footprints\\". This was a bit of romantic verse that moves from sadness at \\"lone footprints in the sand\\" to close with \\"our footprints in the sand\\". Early documentable history The earliest known formally dated publications of any variants of the poem are from 1978, with three different descriptions of the person and also the setting. The first to appear in July, 1978, in a small Iowa town newspaper, is a very concise (six-sentence) version featuring an \\"elderly man\\" and \\"rocky roads\\". There is no attribution for this piece, and this version does not seem to have appeared in any other publication. ::An elderly man, who had lived his life and left this world to go and meet his Maker asked the Lord a question. ::\\"As I'm looking down on the paths I've trod, I see two sets of footprints on the easy paths. ::But down the rocky roads I see only one set of footprints. ::\\"Tell me, Lord, why did you let me go down all those hard paths alone?\\" ::The Lord smiled and simply replied, \\"Oh, my son, you've got that all wrong! ::I carried you over those hard paths.\\" The second and most complete early appearance was in a September 1978 issue of Evangel, a semi-monthly Church of God publication. This version is similar to the \\"Carty\\" version but is credited to \\"Author Unknown--(Submitted by Billy Walker)\\". A third version appeared in October, 1978, in two California papers, first in Oakland and twelve days later in Shafter, with a \\"young woman\\" and a \\"sandy pathway\\" in a \\"desert wilderness\\". This version does not appear to have re-emerged later. ::[A] young woman who was going through hard times ... began to pray to God for help. ::... [S]uddenly in her mind's eye she saw two sets of footprints side by side on a sandy pathway. ::Immediately her spirits lifted because she interpreted this to mean that God was with her and was walking beside her. ::Then the picture changed. She now saw the footprints located in a vast desert wilderness, and instead of two sets of footprints, there ::was only one. ::Why was God no longer beside her? As despair settled back over her, she began to cry. ::Then the inner voice of God softly spoke and said, \\"I have not left you. The one set of footprints is mine. ::You see, I am carrying you through the wilderness.\\" In 1979, additional appearances occurred: two in small Louisiana and Mississippi newspapers, one in a Catholic journal, two in widely syndicated newspapers columns, one on a nationwide radio program and reprinted by two small papers, and one in a prominent evangelist's biography. In January, 1979, the Opelousas, Louisiana, Daily World published a near exact Carty version but with a \\"My dear child\\" mutation at the end, and no attribution. In March, the Winona Times presented a Powers-like version with \\"a certain elderly man ... walking along a sea shore\\" where \\"Out of the waves shot rays of light, mystic and wonderful that played across the sky illuminating scenes from his life\\". He was \\"sorely troubled and his life had been at its saddest and lowest ebb.\\" The March, 1979 issue of Liguorian, a monthly publication of the Catholic Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, published a complete, nearly unmodified first-person version following Carty, but attributed to \\"Author Unknown\\". Christian televangelist and columnist Robert Schuller noted in his column that a reader had sent him a story; it is unclear whether the version presented in the column‚Äîwhich casts a \\"pilgrim\\" as the human character‚Äîwas used verbatim or was rewritten by Schuller: this particular version has not been re-published after the column's original nationwide publication during March‚ÄìAugust, 1979. ::[A] pilgrim arrived in heaven and God said to him, \\"Would you like to see where you've come from?\\" ::When the pilgrim responded that he would, God unfolded the story of his whole life and he saw footprints from the cradle to the grave. ::Only there were not only the footprints of the pilgrim, but another set of prints alongside. ::The pilgrim said, \\"I see my footprints, but whose are those?\\" ::And the Lord said, \\"Those are My footprints. I was with you all the time.\\" ::Then they came to a dark, discouraging valley and the pilgrim said, \\"I see only one set of footprints through that valley. ::I was so discouraged. You were not there with me. It was just as I thought--I was so all alone!\\" ::Then the Lord said, \\"Oh, but I was there. I was with you the whole time. ::You see, those are MY footprints. I carried you all through that valley.\\" In April, 1979, the Havre Daily News in Montana published a variant of the Carty version told in first person with slightly different punctuation and a \\"never, never\\" alteration to match the \\"precious, precious child\\" of the previous sentence. The author of the local weekly column noted that it had been supplied by a friend who had \\"first heard [it] when Paul Harvey quoted it on his radio program.\\" It is unknown whether the listener had copied it down from memory or received a written version from Mr. Harvey or elsewhere. No recordings or transcriptions of Mr. Harvey's daily radio news and commentary broadcasts are known to have survived. A verbatim copy of the Havre instance ran in a small, inmate-produced newsletter published by the Napa State Hospital, in July, 1979. Advice columnist Ann Landers published an exact copy of the Stevenson version in July, 1979. The column indicates that the correspondent who provided the work, claims to have carried a tattered copy around \\"for years\\" with no further explanation of its publication source. She printed the piece again in late February 1982 in response to reader demand and noted that it had also appeared in Reader's Digest. The 1982 republication added a novel phrase \\"I would never desert you\\". Christian televangelist Jerry Falwell's 1979 biography, Jerry Falwell: Aflame for God, opens a chapter with an expanded \\"a man dreamed\\" version. Humorist and columnist Erma Bombeck published a condensed version of Stevenson's variant in July 1980. During the 1980 United States presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan used a variant of \\"Footprints\\", with himself as the human, as the closing lines in an August speech to evangelical leaders in Dallas, Texas. President Reagan used \\"Footprints\\" again in a speech at the annual National Prayer Breakfast on February 5, 1981. These versions appear to be Stevenson paraphrases. Advice columnist Dear Abby ran a Carty version attributed to \\"Author Unknown\\" in late 1981. Influence An artistic rendering of the scene the poetry inspires In 1983, Cristy Lane released country gospel version of the song called \\"Footprints in the Sand\\". The song peaked at No. 64 on the Billboard Country chart and No. 30 on the U.S. Christian chart. The 1983 television movie Choices of the Heart closes with lead character Jean Donovan reciting a condensed version of Powers/Carty. In 1984, Ken Brown published a version of the poem in rhyme and rhythm as opposed to the more commonly known free form versions popular today. In 1994, English singer Chris de Burgh included a summary of the poem as the fourth stanza in his song \\"Snows of New York\\" in the album This Way Up: In my dream we walked, you and I to the shore / Leaving footprints by the sea / And when there was just one set of prints in the sand / That was when you carried me. Per Magnusson, David Kreuger, Richard Page, and Simon Cowell wrote a song based on the poem, called \\"Footprints in the Sand\\", which was recorded by Leona Lewis. It appears on Lewis's debut album Spirit. Another song inspired by the poem called \\"Footprints\\" was recorded by Dancehall/Reggae group T.O.K. The poem is parodied in the Half Man Half Biscuit song \\"Footprints\\", off the 1993 album This Leaden Pall. In the song, the Lord explains the fact that there is only one set of footprints this way: \\"During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, that must have been when I was appearing on . . . Junior Kick Start!\\" The poem was also the inspiration and chorus for the G-Unit song \\"Footprints\\", from their 2003 debut album \\"Beg For Mercy\\". The poem was used in the memorial service for Air France Flight 447 on 3 June 2009. In 2016, a larger-than-life sculpture inspired by the poem was installed at Pippen Memorial Park in Carthage, Texas. See also *Third Man factor ReferencesExternal links *Who wrote \\"Footprints\\"?

The momentum operator is, in the position representation, an example of a differential operator. For the case of one particle in one spatial dimension, the definition is: :\\\\hat{p} = - i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} where is Planck's reduced constant, the imaginary unit, and partial derivatives (denoted by \\\\partial) are used instead of a total derivative () since the wave function is also a function of time. The \\"hat\\" indicates an operator. The \\"application\\" of the operator on a differentiable wave function is as follows: : \\\\hat{p}\\\\psi = - i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} In a basis of Hilbert space consisting of momentum eigenstates expressed in the momentum representation, the action of the operator is simply multiplication by , i.e. it is a multiplication operator, just as the position operator is a multiplication operator in the position representation. Note that the definition above is the canonical momentum, which is not gauge invariant and not a measurable physical quantity for charged particles in an electromagnetic field. In that case, the canonical momentum is not equal to the kinetic momentum. At the time quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s, the momentum operator was found by many theoretical physicists, including Niels Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld, Erwin Schr√∂dinger, and Eugene Wigner. Its existence and form is sometimes taken as one of the foundational postulates of quantum mechanics. Origin from De Broglie plane waves The momentum and energy operators can be constructed in the following way.Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, =One dimension= Starting in one dimension, using the plane wave solution to Schr√∂dinger's equation of a single free particle, : \\\\psi(x, t) = e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}(px - Et)}, where is interpreted as momentum in the -direction and is the particle energy. The first order partial derivative with respect to space is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(x, t)}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\frac{ip}{\\\\hbar} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}(px - Et)} = \\\\frac{ip}{\\\\hbar} \\\\psi. This suggests the operator equivalence : \\\\hat{p} = -i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial x} so the momentum of the particle and the value that is measured when a particle is in a plane wave state is the eigenvalue of the above operator. Since the partial derivative is a linear operator, the momentum operator is also linear, and because any wave function can be expressed as a superposition of other states, when this momentum operator acts on the entire superimposed wave, it yields the momentum eigenvalues for each plane wave component. These new components then superimpose to form the new state, in general not a multiple of the old wave function. =Three dimensions= The derivation in three dimensions is the same, except the gradient operator del is used instead of one partial derivative. In three dimensions, the plane wave solution to Schr√∂dinger's equation is: : \\\\psi = e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-E t)} and the gradient is : \\\\begin{align} abla \\\\psi &= \\\\mathbf{e}_x\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\mathbf{e}_y\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\mathbf{e}_z\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\left ( p_x\\\\mathbf{e}_x + p_y\\\\mathbf{e}_y+ p_z\\\\mathbf{e}_z \\\\right)\\\\psi \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\psi \\\\end{align} where and are the unit vectors for the three spatial dimensions, hence : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} = -i \\\\hbar abla This momentum operator is in position space because the partial derivatives were taken with respect to the spatial variables. Definition (position space) For a single particle with no electric charge and no spin, the momentum operator can be written in the position basis as:Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}}=-i\\\\hbar abla where is the gradient operator, is the reduced Planck constant, and is the imaginary unit. In one spatial dimension this becomes: :\\\\hat{p}=\\\\hat{p}_x=-i\\\\hbar{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x}. This is the expression for the canonical momentum. For a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, during a Gauge Transformation, the position space wave function undergoes a local U(1) group transformation, and \\\\hat{p}\\\\psi = - i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} will change its value. Therefore, the canonical momentum is not gauge invariant, and hence not a measurable physical quantity. The kinetic momentum, a gauge invariant physical quantity, can be expressed in terms of the canonical momentum, the scalar potential and vector potential :Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{P}} = -i\\\\hbar abla - q\\\\mathbf{A} The expression above is called minimal coupling. For electrically neutral particles, the canonical momentum is equal to the kinetic momentum. Properties=Hermiticity= The momentum operator is always a Hermitian operator (more technically, in math terminology a \\"self-adjoint operator\\") when it acts on physical (in particular, normalizable) quantum states.See Lecture notes 1 by Robert Littlejohn for a specific mathematical discussion and proof for the case of a single, uncharged, spin-zero particle. See Lecture notes 4 by Robert Littlejohn for the general case. (In certain artificial situations, such as the quantum states on the semi-infinite interval [0,‚àû), there is no way to make the momentum operator Hermitian. This is closely related to the fact that a semi-infinite interval cannot have translational symmetry‚Äîmore specifically, it does not have unitary translation operators. See below.) =Canonical commutation relation= One can easily show that by appropriately using the momentum basis and the position basis: : \\\\left [ \\\\hat{ x }, \\\\hat{ p } \\\\right ] = \\\\hat{x} \\\\hat{p} - \\\\hat{p} \\\\hat{x} = i \\\\hbar. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are conjugate variables. =Fourier transform= One can show that the Fourier transform of the momentum in quantum mechanics is the position operator. The Fourier transform turns the momentum-basis into the position-basis. The following discussion uses the bra‚Äìket notation: Let \\\\psi = \\\\psi(x) be a wave packet \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = 1, \\\\psi' the Fourier transform of \\\\psi : : \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\hat{p}  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = h \\\\langle \\\\psi'  \\\\hat{x}  \\\\psi' \\\\rangle So momentum = h x spatial frequency, which is similar to energy = h x temporal frequency. : \\\\langle x  \\\\hat{p}  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = - i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\psi ( x ) The same applies for the position operator in the momentum basis: : \\\\langle p  \\\\hat{x}  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dp} \\\\psi ( p ) and other useful relations: : \\\\langle p  \\\\hat{x}  p' \\\\rangle = i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dp} \\\\delta (p - p') : \\\\langle x  \\\\hat{p}  x' \\\\rangle = -i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\delta (x - x') where stands for Dirac's delta function. Derivation from infinitesimal translations The translation operator is denoted , where represents the length of the translation. It satisfies the following identity: : T(\\\\varepsilon)  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\int dx T(\\\\varepsilon)  x \\\\rangle \\\\langle x  \\\\psi \\\\rangle that becomes :\\\\int dx  x + \\\\varepsilon \\\\rangle \\\\langle x \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\int dx  x \\\\rangle \\\\langle x - \\\\varepsilon  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\int dx  x \\\\rangle \\\\psi(x - \\\\varepsilon) Assuming the function to be analytic (i.e. differentiable in some domain of the complex plane), one may expand in a Taylor series about : :\\\\psi(x-\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\psi(x) - \\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{d \\\\psi}{dx} so for infinitesimal values of : : T(\\\\varepsilon) = 1 - \\\\varepsilon {d \\\\over dx} = 1 - {i \\\\over \\\\hbar} \\\\varepsilon \\\\left ( - i \\\\hbar { d \\\\over dx} \\\\right ) As it is known from classical mechanics, the momentum is the generator of translation, so the relation between translation and momentum operators is: : T(\\\\varepsilon) = 1 - {i \\\\over \\\\hbar} \\\\varepsilon \\\\hat{p} thus : \\\\hat{p} = - i \\\\hbar { d \\\\over dx }. 4-momentum operator Inserting the 3d momentum operator above and the energy operator into the 4-momentum (as a 1-form with metric signature): :P_\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\frac{E}{c},-\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\right) obtains the 4-momentum operator; :\\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\hat{E},-\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}}\\\\right) = i\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}, abla\\\\right) = i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_\\\\mu where is the 4-gradient, and the becomes preceding the 3-momentum operator. This operator occurs in relativistic quantum field theory, such as the Dirac equation and other relativistic wave equations, since energy and momentum combine into the 4-momentum vector above, momentum and energy operators correspond to space and time derivatives, and they need to be first order partial derivatives for Lorentz covariance. The Dirac operator and Dirac slash of the 4-momentum is given by contracting with the gamma matrices: : \\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu = i\\\\hbar \\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu = \\\\hat{P} = i\\\\hbar\\\\partial \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/ If the signature was , the operator would be :\\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\hat{E},\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}}\\\\right) = -i\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}, abla\\\\right) = -i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_\\\\mu instead.

Most frequently found in Tasmania and southeast mainland Australia, it is a member of the genus Myrmecia, subfamily Myrmeciinae, and was formally described and named by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. This species is known for its ability to jump long distances. These ants are large; workers and males are about the same size: for workers, and for males. The queen measures roughly long and is similar in appearance to workers, whereas males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. Jack jumper ants are primarily active during the day and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodlands, and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stingers to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper ant. The average worker has a life expectancy over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant is a part of the Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes. Their sting generally only causes a mild local reaction in humans; however, it is one of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, four deaths were due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation). Taxonomy and common names Original holotype specimen (abdomen missing) Ponera ruginoda The specific name derives from the Latin word pilosa, meaning 'covered with soft hair'. The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Myrmecia pilosula from specimens he collected in Hobart in Tasmania. There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen, and male. The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London. In 1922, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species. However, John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the subgenus Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the subgenus in 1943. William Brown synonymised Promyrmecia due to the lack of morphological evidence that would make it distinct from Myrmecia and later placed the jack jumper ant in the genus in 1953. One synonym for the species has been published ‚Äì Ponera ruginoda (also titled Myrmecia ruginoda), described by Smith in the same work, and a male holotype specimen was originally described for this synonym. P. ruginoda was initially placed into the genera Ectatomma and Rhytidoponera, but it was later classified as a junior synonym of the jack jumper ant, after specimens of each were compared. The M. pilosula species complex was first defined by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery. The species complex is a monophyletic group, where the species are closely related to each other, but their actual genetic relationship is distant. Members of this group include M. apicalis, M. chasei, M. chrysogaster, M. croslandi, M. cydista, M. dispar, M. elegans, M. harderi, M. ludlowi, M. michaelseni, M. occidentalis M. queenslandica, M. rugosa, and M. varians. Additional species that were described in this group in 2015 include M. banksi, M. haskinsorum, M. imaii, and M. impaternata. Their characteristic jumping motion when agitated or foraging inspires the common name \\"jack jumper\\", a behaviour also shared with other Myrmecia ants, such as M. nigrocincta. This is the most common name for the ant, along with \\"black jumper,\\" \\"hopper ant\\", \\"jumper ant\\", \\"jumping ant\\", \\"jumping jack\\" and \\"skipper ant\\". It is also named after the jumping-jack firecracker. The species is a member of the genus Myrmecia, a part of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. Description Close-up view of a specimen: These ants attack with both mandibles and stingers. Like its relatives, the ant possesses a powerful sting and large mandibles. These ants can be black or blackish-red in colour, and may have yellow or orange legs. The ant is medium-sized in comparison to other Myrmecia species, where workers are typically long. Excluding mandibles, jack jumpers measure in length. The ant's antennae, tibiae, tarsi, and mandibles are also yellow or orange. Pubescence (hair) on the ant is greyish, short and erect, and is longer and more abundant on their gaster, absent on their antennae, and short and suberect on their legs. The pubescence on the male is grey and long, and abundant throughout the ant's body, but it shortens on the legs. The mandibles are long and slender (measuring ), and concave around the outer border. The queen has a similar appearance to the workers, but her middle body is more irregular and coarser. The queen is also the largest, measuring in length. Males are either smaller or around the same size as workers, measuring . Males also have much smaller, triangular mandibles than workers and queens. The mandibles on the male contain a large tooth at the centre, among the apex and the base of the inner border. Punctures (tiny dots) are noticeable on the head, which are large and shallow, and the thorax and node are also irregularly punctuated. The pubescence on the male's gaster is white and yellowish. Distribution and habitat Two workers stand guard in front of the entrance to their nest Jack jumper ants are abundant in most of Australia, being among the most common bull ant to be encountered. The ants can be found in the south-western tip of Western Australia, where it has been seen in the sand hills around Albany, Mundaring, Denmark and Esperance. The ant is rarely sighted in the northern regions of Western Australia. In South Australia, it is commonly found in the south-east regions of the state, frequently encountered in Mount Lofty (particularly the Adelaide Hills), Normanville, Hallett Cove and Aldgate, but it is not found in north-western regions. There are dense populations on the western seaboard of Kangaroo Island. Jack jumpers are widespread throughout the whole of Victoria, but the species is uncommon in Melbourne. However, populations have been collected from the suburb of Elsternwick, and they are commonly found in the Great Otway Ranges, with many nests observed around Gellibrand. In New South Wales, nests are found throughout the entire state (with the exception of north-western New South Wales), but dense populations are mostly found in the Snowy Mountains, Blue Mountains and coastal regions. The ants are widespread in the Australian Capital Territory. In Queensland, the ants are only found along the south-eastern coastlines of the state, where populations are frequently encountered in the Bunya Mountains, Fletcher, Stanthorpe, Sunshine Coast, Tamborine Mountain and Millmerran, and have been found as far north as Rockhampton. The ant also resides in all of Tasmania, and their presence in the Northern Territory has not been verified. Jack jumper ants live in open habitats, such as damp areas, forests, pastures, gardens, and lawns, preferring fine gravel and sandy soil. Colonies can also be spotted around light bushland. Their preferred natural habitats include woodlands, dry open forests, grasslands, and rural areas, and less common in urban areas. Their nests are mounds built from finely granular gravel, soil, and pebbles, measuring in diameter and can be as tall as 0.5 m (20 in) in height. Two types of nests for this species have been described, one being a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, the other being a complex structure surrounded by a mound. These ants use the sun's warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat in a quick duration, providing the nest with solar energy traps. They decorate their nests with seeds, soil, charcoal, stones, sticks, and even small invertebrate corpses. They also camouflage their nests by covering them with leaf litter, debris, and long grass. Nests can be found hidden under rocks, where queens most likely form their colonies, or around small piles of gravel, instead. Their range in southern Australia, like other regional ant species, appears like that of a relict ant. Jack jumpers have been found in dry sclerophyll forests, at elevations ranging from , averaging . Rove beetles in the genus Heterothops generally thrive in jack jumper nests and raise their brood within their chambers, and skinks have been found in some nests. Worker dragging a pebble Populations are dense in the higher mountain regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north- west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and uses rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry soil, and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not. Pest control of the jack jumper ant is successful in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals such as bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests if they are in a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens have an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests. Behaviour and ecology Worker foraging on top of a dry flower Primarily diurnal, workers search for food during the day until dusk. They are active during warmer months, but are dormant during winter. Fights between these ants within the same colony is not uncommon. They are known for their aggression towards humans, attraction to movement, and well developed vision, being able to observe and follow intruders from 1 m (1.1 yd) away. This species is an accomplished jumper, with leaps ranging from . William Morton Wheeler compared jack jumper ants to \\"Lilliputian cavalry galloping to battle\\" when disturbed, due to their jumping behaviour. He further wrote that they also made a ludicrous appearance as they emerge from their nests, in a series of short hops. While no studies have established whether or not these ants contain alarm pheromones, their relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaws, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination is unknown. =Prey= Worker foraging on a branch Unlike many other ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey, using rapid movements of the head and body to focus on their prey with their enlarged eyes. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, typically foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which are effective in both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, thus can sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. They often hunt for spiders, and sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ants have been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants, or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets. Mature adult ants of this species mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects they find are given to their larvae. However, larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size. Workers mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the honeydew, which is taken to their nests to feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger ones. =Predators and parasites= Blindsnakes of the family Typhlopidae are known to consume Myrmecia broods, although smaller blindsnakes avoid them since they are vulnerable to their stings. Predatory invertebrates such as assassin bugs and redback spiders prey on jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants, and echidnas, particularly the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) hunt jack jumper ants, eating their larvae and eggs. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants by trying to make the ant sting them. The jack jumper ant is a host to the parasite gregarines (Gregarinasina). Ants that host this parasite change colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown jack jumpers were dissected and found to have Gregarinasina spores, while black jack jumpers showed no spores. If it is present in large numbers, the parasite interferes with the normal darkening of the cuticles while the ant is in its pupal stage. The cuticle softens due to the gregarine parasite. =Lifecycle= Like every ant, the life of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). They develop through complete metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Pupae can also eclose (emerge from their pupal stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for. Based on observations of six worker ants, the average life expectancy of the jack jumper is around 1.3 years, but workers were shown to live as little as 1.12 years or as long as 1.6, with the queen living much longer than the workers at 10 years or more. These data give a life expectancy of 401‚Äì584 days, with an average of 474 days. Egg clumping is common, as observed in laboratory colonies. These clumps are often carried by worker ants, and these clumps would contain two to 30 eggs, without any larvae to hold them together. This confirms that eggs from jack jumper colonies do not always lie singly apart. George C. Wheeler and Jeanette Wheeler (1971) studied and described larvae collected from New South Wales and South Australia. They noted that very young larvae of the jack jumper were in length, with two types of body hair. They also described young larvae (matured from very young larvae) at , but with similar body characteristics to mature larvae, at . =Reproduction= Drones (males) emerging from their nest Queens are polyandrous, meaning that queens can mate more than once; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight, and the effective number of mates per queen ranges from 1.0 to 11.4. Most queen ants only mate with one or two males. If the number of available male mates increases, the number of effective matings per queen decreases. Colonies are polygynous, meaning that a colony may house multiple queens; one to four queens typically inhabit a colony, and in multiple-queen colonies, the egg- laying queens are unrelated to one another. Based on a study, 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous (78.57%), showing that this is common in jack jumper colonies. When the queen establishes a nest after mating, she will hunt for food to feed her young, making her semiclaustral. Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1,000. Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals. Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates, having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens. Colonies are mainly polygynous with polyandrous queens, but polyandry in jack jumper colonies is low in comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated to each other, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, suggestions exist of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away. As colonies closer to each other are more genetically similar, independent colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try to return to their nests that they came from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will be similar to the queen's birth nest. Genetics The jack jumper ant genome is contained on a single pair of chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 alleles. Interaction with humans=History= The earliest known account of ant sting fatalities in Australia was first recorded in 1931; two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from the jack jumper ant or M. pyriformis. Thirty years later, another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Historical and IgE results have suggested these two species or perhaps another species were responsible for all recorded deaths. Between 1980 and 2000, four deaths have been recorded, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 years old and had cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis were detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting. Before venom immunotherapy, whole body extract immunotherapy was widely used due to its apparent effectiveness, and it was the only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown to reduce the risk of systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies. In 2003, Professor Simon Brown established the jack jumper desensitisation program, although the program is at risk of closure. Since the establishment of the program, no death has been recorded since 2003. However, the ant may be responsible for the death of a Bunbury man in 2011. =Incidence= The extent of the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy prevalence rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia, due to a high proportion of the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of honeybee stings. One in three million annually die of general anaphalaxis in Australia alone. Over 90% of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by the jack jumper. The ant is notorious in Tasmania, where most fatalities have been recorded. In 2005, over a quarter of all jack jumper sting incidents were sustained in Tasmania; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476,000 people. Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants. =Venom= The jack jumper ant and its relatives in the genus Myrmecia are among the most dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Their venom contains haemolytic and eicosanoid elements and histamines. It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity, which includes phospholipase A2 and B, hyaluronidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase. The venom of the ant also contains several peptides; one being pilosulin 1, which causes cytotoxic effects, pilosulin 2, which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3, which is known to be a major allergen. Other pilosulins include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5. The peptides have known molecular weights. The LD50 (lethal dose) occurs at a lower concentration than for melittin, a peptide found in bee venom. Its LD50 value is 3.6 mg/kg (injected intravenously in mice). Loss of cell viability in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures the proportions of cells that glow in the presence of fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein‚ÄìBarr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering cell viability; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1. 20 percent of jack jumper ants have an empty venom sac, so failure to display a sting reaction should not be interpreted as a loss of sensitivity. Substantial amounts of ant venom have been analysed to characterise venom components, and the jack jumper has been a main subject in these studies. An East Carolina University study which summarised the knowledge about ant stings and their venom showed that only the fire ant and jack jumper had the allergenic components of their venom extensively investigated. These allergenic components include peptides found as heterodimers, homodimers and pilosulin 3. Only six Myrmecia ants, including the jack jumper, are capable of inducing IgE antibodies. Due to the vast differentiation of venom produced in each Myrmecia species, and other species sharing similar characteristics to the jack jumper ant, diagnosing which ant is responsible for an anaphylactic reaction is difficult. A review of a patients history with allergies while identifying a positive result of venom specific IgE levels helps to identify the species of ant that caused a reaction. =Signs and symptoms= Reactions to the ants sting show similar symptoms to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and swelling of the lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps are the most common causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs. In individuals allergic to the venom (about 2‚Äì3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects such as the western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients with a history of systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years. In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom study was conducted, with the goal of determining which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to stings from ants of genus Myrmecia. Of the 265 patients who reacted to such a sting, 176 were from the jack jumper, 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions. Most people recover uneventfully following a mild local reaction and up to about 3% of individuals suffer a severe localised reaction. Most individuals who suffer from severe localised reactions will most likely encounter another reaction if stung again. Fatalities are rare, and venom immunotherapy can prevent fatalities. =First aid and emergency treatment= The flowering plant Carpobrotus glaucescens is useful to ease the pain from a sting If no signs of an allergic reaction are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days. Emergency treatment is needed in a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis. There are several bush remedies used to treat jack jumper stings (and any other Myrmecia sting). The young tips of a bracken fern provide a useful bush remedy to treat jack jumper stings, discovered and currently used by indigenous Australians. The tips are rubbed on the stung area, and may relieve the local pain after getting stung. Another plant used as a bush remedy is Carpobrotus glaucescens (known as angular sea-fig or pigface). =Desensitisation and prevention= The Royal Hobart Hospital in Hobart, Tasmania offers a desensitisation program for people who are prone to severe anaphylactic reactions to jack jumper ant stings Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) to the jack jumper sting venom has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis, but the standardisation of jack jumper venom is yet to be validated. Unlike bee and wasp sting immunotherapy, jack jumper immunotherapy lacks funding and no government rebate is available. Venom is available; however, no commercial venom extract is available that can be used for skin testing. Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme. The Royal Hobart Hospital offers a desensitisation program for patients who have had a severe allergic reaction to a jack jumper sting. However, the program may face closure due to budget cuts. Professor Simon Brown, who founded the program, commented, \\"Closing the program will leave 300 patients hanging in the lurch\\". There is a campaign to make the program available in Victoria. The Royal Adelaide Hospital runs a small-scale program that desensitises patients to the ant's venom. Patients are given an injection of venom under the skin in small amounts. During immunotherapy, the first dose is small, but will gradually increase per injection. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body. Follow-ups of untreated people over thirty with a history of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation. It is suggested that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised to stay away from all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.

These wide primary routes were designed to accommodate the city tram network of the era, but the side streets are generally narrow, and with multiple cars in 21st century households and limited off-road driveways, traffic issues are commonplace, exacerbated by commuters parking their vehicles near the station, which has no formal car park. Croftfoot's location bordering the existing railway but with the only direct access across the tracks being footpaths (Castlemilk Road is a continuation of the road of the same name running through Bankhead / King's Park with an almost identical appearance of housing style, but does not connect other than by a pedestrian underpass) means all vehicles approaching from the north must either travel around Spittal - a detour of from Bankhead Road at Croftfoot station - or via Menock Road - a detour of from Castlemilk Road at King's Park Avenue - to enter the area.

It is usually designed to plug into the ear canal of the user. Operation A crystal earpiece typically consists of a piezoelectric crystal with metal electrodes attached to either side, glued to a conical plastic or metal foil diaphragm, enclosed in a plastic case. The piezoelectric material used in early crystal earphones was Rochelle salt, but modern earphones use barium titanate, or less often quartz. When the audio signal is applied to the electrodes, the crystal bends back and forth a little with the signal, vibrating the diaphragm. The diaphragm pushes on the air, creating sound waves. The plastic earpiece casing confines the sound waves and conducts them efficiently into the ear canal, to the eardrum. The diaphragm is generally fixed at its outer edge, relying on bending to operate. The air path in the earpiece is generally a horn shape, with a narrowing column of air which increases the air displacement at the eardrum, increasing the volume. Application Crystal earpieces are usually monaural devices with very low sound fidelity, but high sensitivity and impedance. Their peak use was probably with 1960s era transistor radios and hearing aids. They are not used with modern portable media players due to unacceptable sound quality. The main causes of poor performance with these earpieces are low diaphragm excursion, nonlinearity, in-band resonance and the very short horn shape of the earpiece casing. The resulting sound is very tinny and lacking in bass. Modern headphones use electromagnetic drivers that work similarly to speakers, with moving coils or moving iron cores in a magnetic field. One remaining use for crystal earpieces is in crystal radios. Their very high sensitivity enables them to use the very weak signals produced by crystal radios, and their high impedance (on the order of 20 kilohms) is a good match for the typical crystal radio. They have also been used as microphones, with their high output requiring less amplification.

Biography Elizabeth was born on 15 April 1677, the second daughter of Sir Charles Halket, baronet, of Pitfirran, Fife, and his wife Janet, daughter of Sir Patrick Murray. In 1696 she married Sir Henry Wardlaw, 4th Baronet, of Pitreavie and together they had three daughters and a son. The ballad of Hardyknute, published in 1719 as an old poem, was supposed to have been discovered by her in a vault at Dunfermline, but no manuscript was ever produced. In 1724 Allan Ramsay included the poem in The Ever Green, his anthology of Scottish poetry. In the 1767 edition of Percy's Reliques the poem was ascribed to Lady Wardlaw. The ballad of Sir Patrick Spens (F. J. Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, ii. 17) has also been asserted to be her work, one of the supporters of the theory being Robert Chambers (Remarks on Scottish Ballads, 1859). The level of accomplishment in Hardyknute, however, gives no reason for supposing that Lady Wardlaw was capable of producing Sir Patrick Spens.

Because there is a plurality of Christian accounts of Eucharist, there is a plurality of practices and traditions concerning the norms for participation in that case of a Christian who has an intellectual disability. Some Christian traditions maintain that a theological understanding of the sacrament is necessary to receive Eucharist and, therefore, do not administer the sacrament to intellectually disabled persons. Other Christian traditions maintain that spiritual devotion to the real presence of Jesus Christ is necessary to receive the Eucharist and, therefore, administer the sacrament to intellectually disabled persons under particular conditions‚Äîpresuming the benefit of the sacrament can be received even if the Eucharist is not consumed. Still other Christian traditions understand the practice of Eucharist principally as a communal expression of community solidarity or unity and, therefore, administer the sacrament indiscriminately during the liturgy. History Both the theological and material history of how intellectually disabled persons have participated in the sacrament of Eucharist is available to researchers. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of printed text and challenges of translation, that theological and material history is generally unfamiliar to non-specialists. Nevertheless, advances in the digitization of rare texts has allowed for an unprecedented rediscovery of Ancient, Medieval, and Early Modern Christian practices and teaching on how persons who \\"lack the full use of reason\\" participate in the Christian sacraments. There is a well documented contemporary prejudice against premodern accounts of intellectual disability / mental illness, which supposes that premodern philosophers and theologians took those forms of impairment to be instances of demon possession. Although that contemporary prejudice has been wholly discredited by historians, the association has lingered in the popular imagination of western Christians‚Äîsuch that many contemporary Christian traditions and communities do not administer the sacrament of Eucharist to intellectually disabled and/or mentally ill persons. Roman Catholicism Thomas Aquinas maintained that all cognitively impaired Christians have a right to the Eucharist and that the sacrament should not be withheld from such persons, except in the most extreme of circumstances (STh III.80.9). According to Aquinas, the extreme circumstance that warrants withholding the Eucharist from a cognitively impaired Christian is if the Christian is entirely incapable of expressing their desire to receive the Eucharist. The worry of Aquinas is that the Eucharist would be forced upon someone who does not want to participate in the sacrament. The Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church (and those bodies in full communion with it) has official policy about how the sacraments should be administered in the case of adult Christians who lack the use of reason. The rationale is developed on the understanding that persons who lack the use of reason, like infants, need the assistance of others to participate in the sacraments of the Church. See Canons 96-99. Thus, ecclesial care for infants provides the principles for the ecclesial care of intellectually disabled persons. Regarding the administration of Eucharist to children and other persons who lack the use of reason, Canon 913 states :\\"¬ß1. The administration of the Most Holy Eucharist to children requires that they have sufficient knowledge and careful preparation so that they understand the mystery of Christ according to their capacity and are able to receive the body of Christ with faith and devotion.\\" :\\"¬ß2. The Most Holy Eucharist, however, can be administered to children in danger of death if they can distinguish the body of Christ from ordinary food and receive communion reverently.\\" This policy is reflected in the positions published by many Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. For example, in the section regarding preparation for First Communion: :Children who are mentally retarded are to be admitted to the Eucharist when they express a desire for the sacrament and in some way manifest their reverence for it. In cases of profound retardation, the Eucharist may be shared without further requirements, as long as the child is able to consume the sacred elements. Additionally, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated in its Guidelines for the Celebration of the Sacraments with Persons with Disabilities (approved 1995): :the criterion for reception of holy communion is the same for persons with developmental and mental disabilities as for all persons, namely, that the person be able to distinguish the Body of Christ from ordinary food, even if this recognition is evidenced through manner, gesture, or reverential silence rather than verbally. Pastors are encouraged to consult with parents, those who take the place of parents, diocesan personnel involved with disability issues, psychologists, religious educators, and other experts in making their judgment. If it is determined that a parishioner who is disabled is not ready to receive the sacrament, great care is to be taken in explaining the reasons for this decision. Cases of doubt should be resolved in favor of the right of the baptized person to receive the sacrament. The existence of a disability is not considered in and of itself as disqualifying a person from receiving the eucharist. In an effort to better reach marginalized populations, such as those struggling with autism and other developmental disabilities, while at the same time providing for their religious education, organizations have emerged offering online alternatives to traditional Faith Formation in keeping with the USCCB's Guidelines. Similar to the Roman Catholic view, Eastern Catholic Churches which practice infant communion, favor the right of intellectually disabled Christians to receive the Eucharist. Orthodox Christianity Orthodox Christianity makes Communion available to all baptized and chrismated church members who wish to receive it, regardless of developmental or other disabilities. The theory is that the soul of the recipient understands what is being received even if the conscious mind is incapable of doing so, and that the grace imparted by Communion \\"for the healing of soul and body\\" is a benefit that most especially should not be denied in such cases. This is consistent with the practice of Infant Communion in Eastern Orthodoxy. Orthodox Christians typically receive the Sacrament of Confession before receiving the Eucharist (see Eucharistic discipline). However, for those who are either mentally incapable of recognizing or recalling their sins, or who are mentally or physically incapable of communicating their sins to a priest, this requirement is dispensed with, just as it is for very young children. Protestantism The Church of Scotland says this regarding those with learning difficulties: :\\"Notwithstanding the terms of Section 13 above [which obliges a Kirk Session to test the faith and understanding of a baptised person before authorising admission to the Lord's Table (ed.)] there is nothing in the law of the Church which would automatically disqualify a person with learning difficulties from admission to the Lord's Table and from having his or her name added to the Communion Roll of a congregation.\\" In most evangelical Christian churches, the only requirement for any individual to participate in Communion is that the person professes to have a personal relationship with God and to have accepted Jesus Christ as his or her Savior. Before Communion in these churches, the policy is usually verbally outlined and the decision is left up to the individual.

It was created under Title IX of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (P.L. 103-236 SEC. 900) to conduct \\"an investigation into all matters in any way related to any legislation, executive order, regulation, practice, or procedure relating to classified information or granting security clearances\\" and to submit a final report with recommendations. The Commission's investigation of government secrecy was the first authorized by statute since the Wright Commission on Government Security issued its report in 1957. The Commission issued its unanimous final report on March 3, 1997. Key findings The Commission's key findings were: *Secrecy is a form of government regulation. *Excessive secrecy has significant consequences for the national interest when policy makers are not fully informed, the government is not held accountable for its actions, and the public cannot engage in informed debate. *Some secrecy is important to minimize inappropriate diffusion of details of weapon systems design and ongoing security operations as well as to allow public servants to secretly consider a variety of policy options without fear of criticism. *The best way to ensure that secrecy is respected, and that the most important secrets remain secret, is for secrecy to be returned to its limited but necessary role. Secrets can be protected more effectively if secrecy is reduced overall. *Apart from aspects of nuclear energy subject to the Atomic Energy Act, secrets in the federal government are whatever anyone with a stamp decides to stamp secret. This inevitably produces problems where even the President of the United States may make mistakes that might have been avoided with a more open system. *A new statute is needed to set forth the principles for what may be declared secret. Senator Moynihan reported that approximately 400,000 new secrets are created annually at the highest level, Top Secret. That level is defined by law as applying to any secret that, were it to become public, would cause \\"exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\\" In 1994, it was estimated that the United States government had over 1.5 billion pages of classified material that were at least 25 years old. In 1995 President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12958 updated the national security classification and declassification system. This Executive Order established a system to automatically declassify information more than 25 years old, unless the government took discrete steps to continue the classification of a particular document or group of documents.

Cold War secrecy The Commission findings regarding government secrecy in the early Cold War period have led to a reevaluation of many public perceptions regarding the period. By 1950, the United States government was in possession of information which the American public did not know: proof of a serious attack on American security by the Soviet Union, with considerable assistance from an enemy within. Soviet authorities knew the U.S. government knew. Only the American people were denied this information. One revelation of the Venona project intercepts is that many Americans who spied for the Soviet Union were never prosecuted. To do so the government would have to reveal what it knew. On 29 May 1946, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a high administration official a memorandum reporting \\"an enormous Soviet espionage ring in Washington.\\" Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson was (falsely) at the top of the list. Truman distrusted Hoover and suspected Hoover of playing political games. Acheson's inclusion at the top of the list automatically discredited other accusations which were on target, Alger Hiss and Nathan Gregory Silvermaster. In late August or early September 1947, the Army Security Agency informed the FBI it had begun to break into Soviet espionage messages. Truman had never been told of the existence of the Venona project, and always insisted Republicans had trumped up the loyalty issue for political gain. The prosecutors in the internal-security cases of the 1940s did not know they had not been given all, or even the best government evidence, against the Rosenbergs, and others. The Venona project materials would have been conclusive in establishing the cast of characters in the Soviet spy networks. Government secrecy allowed critics of the Rosenberg and Hiss cases to construct elaborate theories about frame-ups and cover-ups. For years the Rosenbergs' defenders demanded that the government reveal its secrets about the case. When Secrecy Commission forced the disclosure of documents, the secrets revealed the government's case was even stronger. \\"Over the years,\\" said Ronald Radosh, \\"the Rosenbergs' defenders have loudly demanded the release of government documents on the case, only to deny the documents' significance once they are made public.\\" As archives of the Cold War are opened, the original case made against Soviet espionage in the United States has received ever more conclusive corroboration. Loyalty There is much information within a bureaucracy which could be used to injure the Government, or the national interest if revealed by disloyal persons to hostile nations or, for that matter, to hostile internal elements. It appears that the three-tiered gradation of today, Confidential/ Secret/Top Secret was adopted by the U.S. military from British forces in France in 1917, and was institutionalized with the Espionage Act of 1917. The U.S. Civil Service Commission, established by the Pendleton Act in 1883, was debarring persons relating to \\"loyalty\\" as late as 1921. The Commission Report quotes Max Weber, > Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the professionally > informed by keeping their knowledge and intentions secret ... Bureaucracy > naturally welcomes a poorly informed and hence a powerless parliament‚Äîat > least insofar as ignorance somehow agrees with the bureaucracy's interests. In March 1947 President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, establishing the Federal Employee Loyalty Program, providing uniform investigation standards and procedures, and authorizing the creation of Loyalty Review Boards across the Government. The Truman Order‚Äîbased on the findings of an interdepartmental committee established in 1946‚Äîwas superseded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's issuance of Executive Order 10450 in April 1953, which provided that \\"[t]he appointment of each civilian officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be made subject to an investigation,\\" and made each agency head responsible for ensuring that \\"the employment and retention in employment of any civilian officer or employee within the department or agency is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\\" While abolishing the Truman Order program, including the Loyalty Review Boards within the Civil Service Commission, the new Order also made clear that \\"the interests of national security require that all persons privileged to be employed in the departments and agencies of the Government, shall be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States.\\" In this manner, a broader \\"security\\" program was established across the Government. The political pressure had increased with the passage of legislation in 1950 \\"[t]o protect the national security of the United States by permitting the summary suspension of employment of civilian officers and employees of various departments and agencies. ... \\" In addition, beginning in March 1948, the Attorney General's List was published on a regular basis‚Äîwith members of organizations included on such a list to be denied employment in the federal government or defense industries as well as the right to a U.S. passport. During the 1952 presidential campaign, Dwight D. Eisenhower promised to root out Communists and other security risks from government and defense industry employment‚Äî suggesting that their presence had been tolerated too easily by the Truman administration despite the existence of rules to address \\"loyalty\\" concerns. In his first State of the Union address Eisenhower promised a new system \\"for keeping out the disloyal and the dangerous.\\" Executive Order 10450 soon followed. Senator Joseph McCarthy praised the new Executive Order. The New York Times reported, \\"The new program will require a new investigation of many thousands of employees previously investigated, as well as many more thousands who have had no security check.\\" In November 1953, Attorney General Herbert Brownell would allege in a speech that Truman had nominated a Soviet spy‚Äîsenior Treasury Department official Harry Dexter White‚Äîto serve as the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund, despite what Brownell said was the President's awareness of White's involvement in Soviet espionage. And on December 3, 1953, President Eisenhower directed that a \\"blank wall be placed between Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and secret data\\"‚Äîmarking the beginning of the process that led to the Atomic Energy Commission's suspension of Oppenheimer's security clearance later in December and its 4-to-1 decision on June 28, 1954, against restoring the clearance.

She was the first heroine to use the name, and for a time was replaced by Ice. She is also one of the few ice themed superheroines in the DC Universe. She first appeared in Super Friends #9 (Dec 1977). Fictional character biography=Global Guardians= Sigrid Nansen received her powers as the result of an experiment funded by the Norwegian government. In an attempt to please both her overbearing scientist mother (who constantly belittled her for not having a boyfriend and not being a top scientist) and the Norwegian government, Sigrid reluctantly agreed to the experiments. The goal was to duplicate the abilities of what at the time were a legendary tribe of Ice-people; the experiment was a success, though as a side-effect Sigrid's skin was permanently turned blue. Taking the name Icemaiden, she joined the Global Guardians as her country's representative to that international super- team. =Legends= During the DC miniseries Legends (1986) the people of the United States were turned against all heroes, superheroes, and metahumans; the President even decreed that no costumed hero could operate legally. This did not affect the Global Guardians, however, who worked outside of the US. During this time, what Sylvester Pemberton referred to as the \\"Great Super-Hero Scare\\"Infinity Inc Special 1, 1987 Doctor Mist sent Icemaiden, along with Rising Sun, the Tasmanian Devil, and the Green Flame to Canada to run security for the international Trade Conference. Icemaiden fell victim, however, to the group calling itself Injustice Unlimited, and was hypnotized into serving the villains. This resulted in her traveling to Greenland with Jade and the new Icicle on a mission to find and free Solomon Grundy. In the end the villains were defeated and Icemaiden regained her free will.Infinity Inc. #32-37 =Resignation= Upon the discovery of a real tribe of Ice-people, their princess Tora Olafsdotter (Ice) joined the Global Guardians. This led Sigrid to quit the team. =Justice League= Years later, after Ice had left the Global Guardians, joined the Justice League International, and was killed by the Overmaster, Sigrid re-emerged. She chose to honor the fallen heroine by serving as her replacement in the Justice League. There were hints of a romantic relationship with her teammate Fire, but this was all part of a plan hatched by Sigrid. Realizing Fire was not coping with Ice's death (and Fire was attempting to control her, much like her mother had done growing up), she physically remade herself resemble Ice and showed romantic feelings toward Fire. The shock made Fire realize that Ice was gone, and she could not recreate the past. During her time in the JLA, she was disliked and criticized by Guy Gardner, who had also not come to terms with Ice's death. She left active duty with the League after she and several others were heavily wounded during the attack of the Hyperclan (White Martians). Later recovered, Sigrid resumed her super-hero career and is assumed to have eventually joined an unofficial branch of Justice League Europe. That League chapter was, however, infiltrated by the Mist, who apparently lured Icemaiden away and subsequently disguised herself as the blue-skinned heroine before killing three League members: Crimson Fox, Amazing Man, and Blue Devil. In the same story, it was revealed that Mist covertly contacted Icemaiden and informed her of a supposed threat facing her homeland of Norway, and she must defeat the threat without informing anyone until afterwards. Icemaiden left during the middle of the night, and Mist replaced her within the JLE by the next morning. The JLE did not know that Mist replaced Icemaiden until Mist began her attacks against them. Mist informed Crimson Fox that the threat she informed Icemaiden about was not real, and that she had sent Icemaiden on an ultimately fruitless search so that she could disguise herself as Icemaiden and replace her on the team.Starman #38 =One Year Later= After the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, it was revealed that Icemaiden had at some point been abducted by the supervillain Warp, a capture paid for by a mysterious \\"organ-napper\\" who turned out to be former film actress Delores Winters. Winters‚Äîbelieved to have been killed decades earlier by the Ultra-Humanite‚Äîlonged for new flesh to replace her own aging skin and had her personal physician surgically flay the Icemaiden in order to harvest her superpowered skin. Icemaiden did not die, however, and eventually was placed, comatose, into a hydration womb within a facility of S.T.A.R. Labs.JSA Classified #19-20, Jan-Feb 2007. DC Comics. Later, in the same story, the hydration womb is cracked. It is unknown if Icemaiden survived. It is mentioned in this story that Icemaiden has alabaster skin, although she had blue skin in all of her prior appearances save for her appearance in Extreme Justice.Extreme Justice #10-11, Nov-Dec 1995 Delores was recently killed in a battle with Batwoman, and her corpse was taken by the Justice League. It is unknown if they will be able to remove the skin. Relationships Sigrid is one of the few bisexual superheroines operating in the DC Universe. She was flirtatious with Nuklon during their time together in the JLA, and then later became involved with Olivia Reynolds, the ex- girlfriend of Hal Jordan.Justice League America #110, #113 She also showed interest in Judaism during her conversations with Nuklon. Powers and abilities Icemaiden possesses abilities surrounding ice, snow and cold. Sigrid's powers are not natural as they are the result of scientific experiments, imitating the Nordic mythical Ice-people. Whether it was a success because she had a dormant gene is unknown. Icemaiden can control small quantities of snow and ice, and project ice shields and icicles from her body, but her greatest ability is to become very cold and create ice armor in times of great stress. Her powers are closely linked to her mental state.

It is the muscle responsible for \\"flaring\\" of the nostrils. Some people can use it to close the nostrils to prevent entry of water when underwater. It consists of two parts, transverse and alar: * The transverse part (compressor naris) arises from the maxilla, above and lateral to the incisive fossa; its fibers proceed upward and medially, expanding into a thin aponeurosis which is continuous on the bridge of the nose with that of the muscle of the opposite side, and with the aponeurosis of the Procerus. It compresses the nostrils and may completely close them. * The alar part (dilator naris) arises from the maxilla over the lateral incisor and inserts into the greater alar cartilage. Its medial fibres tend to blend with the depressor septi, and has been described as part of that muscle. Like all the other muscles of facial expression, nasalis muscle is innervated by the seventh cranial nerve: the facial nerve.

It was released under Epic Records and produced by Jack Douglas, a frequent collaborator of the band. The album did not reach the Billboard 200 chart but did \\"bubble under\\" at number 207 for one week in April 1977.Whitburn, Joel. Bubbling Under Singles & Albums (1998): 311  Overview  Most of the songs have a more raw sound akin to hard rock bands of the period compared to the group's later more polished power pop style, and the song lyrics deal with more extreme subject matter than later albums. For instance, \\"The Ballad of T.V. Violence\\" is about serial killer Richard Speck, \\"Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School\\" is about an ephebophile, and \\"Oh, Candy\\" is about a photographer friend of the band, Marshall Mintz, who committed suicide.  Critical reception  The album was generally well- received by critics with favorable comparisons to the Beatles and the Who, with critics likening Robin Zander's vocals to John Lennon's. Charles M. Young, writing for Rolling Stone, said the album had a \\"heavy emphasis on basics with a strain of demented violence\\" and that the lyrics \\"run the gamut of lust, confusion and misogyny, growing out of rejection and antiauthoritarian sentiments about school‚Äîall with an element of wit.\\" Ira Robbins of Trouser Press noted the album's \\"wall-of-guitar sound\\" and said the band was \\"sarcastic, smart, nasty, powerful, tight, casual, and destined for something great.\\"  Track listing  All songs written by Rick Nielsen except where noted. Note: The original vinyl record had \\"Side A\\" printed on the label on one side and \\"Side 1\\" printed on the other, a humorous touch reflecting the band's conviction that they didn't have any \\"B material\\". The placement of the track listing on the jacket seemed to indicate \\"Hot Love\\" was the first track on the album. When the album was released on CD in the mid-1980s, it followed the same sequence. However, when the album was re-issued in 1998, the band's preferred sequence was used, placing \\"Side 1\\" before \\"Side A\\" and included five bonus tracks: Personnel ;Cheap Trick * Robin Zander ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Rick Nielsen ‚Äì lead guitar, mandocello, vocals * Tom Petersson ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals * Bun E.

Big Black released a cover of \\"He's a Whore\\" as a single with a picture sleeve in the style of Cheap Trick's album cover. The back of the sleeve was a similar take on the German band Kraftwerk and their song, \\"The Model\\". Big Black's version was included as a bonus track on the CD release of their second album, Songs About Fucking. The Methadones covered \\"He's a Whore\\" on 21st Century Power Pop Riot, an album of covers released in 2006. Concrete Blonde covered \\"Mandocello\\" on Still in Hollywood.

Traditionally, provable security is asymptotic: it classifies the hardness of computational problems using polynomial-time reducibility. Secure schemes are defined to be those in which the advantage of any computationally bounded adversary is negligible. While such a theoretical guarantee is important, in practice one needs to know exactly how efficient a reduction is because of the need to instantiate the security parameter - it is not enough to know that \\"sufficiently large\\" security parameters will do. An inefficient reduction results either in the success probability for the adversary or the resource requirement of the scheme being greater than desired. Concrete security parametrizes all the resources available to the adversary, such as running time and memory, and other resources specific to the system in question, such as the number of plaintexts it can obtain or the number of queries it can make to any oracles available. Then the advantage of the adversary is upper bounded as a function of these resources and of the problem size. It is often possible to give a lower bound (i.e. an adversarial strategy) matching the upper bound, hence the name exact security. References * M. Bellare, A. Desai, E. Jokipii and P. Rogaway.

During the 1990s the group fell into decay. Most of its cadres later defected to the Taliban, including the spiritual leader of the Taliban Mohammed Omar. The movement was also weakened by the founding of the breakaway National and Islamic Prosperity Party of Afghanistan, formed by Maulawi Muhammad Osman Salekzada, which captured much of the HIIs following in northern Afghanistan. After the death of its leader, Mohammed Nabi Mohamadi, in Pakistan in 2001, the leadership of the movement was taken over by his son Ahmad Nabi Muhammadi. Under its new leadership the name of the movement was changed to Islamic and National Revolution Movement of Afghanistan (Harakat-e Inqilab-e Islami wa Melli-ye Afghanistan).

She was laid down on 29 November 1966 by Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington; launched 21 June 1969; and commissioned on 28 March 1970. She is the fifth United States Navy ship named after Detroit, Michigan, the largest city in the state of Michigan, and the river of the same name. Detroit served for 35 years operating primarily with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf regions. Service history=1970-1980= After her initial shakedown cruise, Detroit departed Bremerton for her first operational home port, Newport, Rhode Island, rounding the horn of South America en route. In March 1971, she was involved in a minor collision with a US Navy oiler off the coast of South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Detroit deployed for six months of extended operations with the 6th Fleet, returning to Newport in December 1971. In April 1972 the Detroit escorted USS Saratoga CV-60 to the southern tip of Africa on her way to support the war in Vietnam. Detroit refueled Saratoga then returned to home port. Detroit made her second deployment with 6th Fleet to the Mediterranean on 1 December 1972, returning to Newport in July of the following year. On 12 December 1973, while the ship was undergoing repairs and upkeep in Newport, Detroit suffered an explosion in her after engine room exhaust stack which caused extensive material damage. A shore establishment realignment led to Detroit's home port shift to Norfolk, Virginia in January 1974. Detroit sailed from Norfolk 14 July 1974, en route to her third Mediterranean deployment in support of 6th Fleet operations. In addition to her normal taskings, she participated in contingency operations related to the Cyprus crisis, completing this task in December 1974 before returning to Norfolk. Detroit sailed for her fourth Mediterranean deployment on 19 August 1975 and completed over 200 replenishments before returning to Norfolk on 28 January 1976. On 13 July 1976, Detroit sailed north to commence her first shipyard overhaul at Bath Iron Works in Maine. The NATO Sea Sparrow missile system and new communications capabilities were added prior to her return to Norfolk in July 1977. Detroit sailed from Norfolk on her fifth Mediterranean deployment on 4 April 1978, returning on 26 October 1978. She and her CH-46 helicopter detachment conducted 232 underway and vertical replenishments during this deployment, serving in a Task Group led by USS Forrestal(CV-59). After another five-month Mediterranean deployment in 1979, Detroit returned to Norfolk for a short six-month turn-around in preparation for her seventh Mediterranean deployment, commencing on 14 July 1980. A Suez Canal transit followed National Week exercises, and the new routine became the support of U.S. 7th Fleet‚Äôs Indian Ocean Battle Group operating in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf. Returning through the Suez, Detroit proceeded to service 6th Fleet units prior to visiting Lisbon, Portugal, in late November. Detroit returned to Norfolk on 11 December 1980. =1981-1989= On 10 June 1981 Detroit ran aground when she veered from the dredged channel and ran aground in shallow water in Hampton Roads while the ship was entering port. She was refloated four days later after fuel and weapons were removed. There was no apparent damage to ship or injuries to the crew, but the commanding officer was relieved of command for the incident. Detroit departed Norfolk on 25 June 1981 for her eighth Mediterranean deployment. She serviced 6th Fleet and NATO units and participated in the missile exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, when two Libyan aircraft were shot down by F-14 Tomcats from USS Nimitz (CVN-68). Detroit returned to Norfolk on 8 November 1981. In January 1982, Detroit began her second shipyard overhaul at Norfolk Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company‚Äôs Berkeley Yard in Chesapeake, Virginia. The focus of this overhaul was on the engineering plant and the crew‚Äôs living quarters. Her defensive capability was also upgraded by the addition of two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS Mark 15 guns. Detroit left the yard in January 1983. On 20 October 1983, Detroit departed for deployment with the 6th Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, Detroit was the principal combat logistics force ship supporting U.S. and Allied units of the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force, in Beirut, Lebanon. Throughout the height of the crisis, Detroit provided logistical support to two carrier battle groups, the battle group and the deployed Marine Amphibious Ready Group. On 9 January 1984 Detroit suffered a fuel fire in her forced-draft blower while moored at Souda Bay, Crete. Some crew members were treated for smoke inhalation. When she returned to Norfolk on 2 May 1984, Detroit had completed 301 replenishments, a new ship‚Äôs record. In February 1985, Detroit completed an extensive three-month repair availability. From July through October 1985, she participated in fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea, as well as in \\"Ocean Safari 85\\" operating above the Arctic Circle in Norway's Vestfjord. During these operations, Detroit encountered a severe storm consisting of extreme cold and heavy seas. As a result, Detroit suffered the loss of a large section of main deck railing, several deck fixtures and the ship‚Äôs solid brass bell. Detroit put in for repairs in Dunoon, Scotland before continuing operations. In August 1985, Detroit successfully completed the first Operational Propulsion Plant Examination given to an AOE by the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Propulsion Examination Board. In March 1986, Detroit departed Norfolk for her tenth deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She supported three carrier operations off the coast of Libya in March and April 1986. In September 1986, she returned to Norfolk. Beginning in the fall of 1986 the Detroit was once again sent in for an overhaul following her deployment. Starting in Virginia at Norfolk shipbuilding, she went through what was supposed to be a rapid turn around, with primary work on her engines. Following the departure, with numerous delays, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for exercises and crew training. While there she suffered a major malfunction to her engines that would hamper her from 1987 - 1990. She was sent to Philadelphia for more work on her engines that lasted from 1987 -1988. Upon her return to Norfolk her suffered a fatality in her engine room with a sailor being scalded with live steam. The summer of 1988 found Detroit back in the European theater, participating in Exercise Teamwork 88 replenishing U.S. and NATO allies in the Norwegian fjords. After officially changing homeports in October 1989, Detroit was underway in support of law enforcement operations in the Caribbean Sea. =1990-1999= In May 1990, Detroit arrived at Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey where she was homeported until decommissioning in 2005. In August 1990, Detroit deployed to the Mediterranean for the 11th time since commissioning, but was diverted to the Red Sea in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. She remained on station in the Red Sea through the remainder of the year. On 17 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced with Detroit as one of two fast combat support ships on station. Detroit's crew worked non-stop for the remaining three months of what ultimately became a nine-month deployment. Detroit commenced a six-month dry docked phased maintenance availability in May 1991 at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. In May 1992, Detroit returned to 6th Fleet in support of MED 2-92. This deployment proved to be remarkably successful for Detroit and her crew. Detroit participated in the insertion and retrieval of United States Army and Navy Special Forces during the Exercise Ellipse Bravo, and rescue efforts to the TCG Muavenet, a Turkish warship, after it was struck by a missile from the USS Saratoga. USS Detroit during a dual underway replenishmentDetroit returned to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a dry docked phased maintenance availability in July 1993. Shipyard repairs were completed in January 1994 and the ship immediately commenced work-ups for her next deployment. On 20 October 1994, Detroit was underway for her 13th Mediterranean deployment. Prior to arriving in the Mediterranean, the ship was tasked to take station in the Arabian Sea in support of U.S. Naval Forces. Detroit returned to the 6th Fleet in December 1994. She remained in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, providing logistics support for the remainder of the deployment. On 22 November 1996, Detroit deployed with the battle group for her 14th Mediterranean deployment. Detroit performed operations in the Adriatic Sea, as well as transiting the Suez Canal, joining the U.S. 5th Fleet in support of Operation Southern Watch. Additionally, she participated in exercise \\"Inspired Siren 2-97\\" and a variety of other multi-national exercises. Detroit returned to Earle, New Jersey on 22 May 1997. She was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation during this deployment. From July through November 1997, Detroit underwent a four-month phased maintenance availability, which extended the life of her propulsion plant at least another ten years. Detroit earned the Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet 1997 Battle Efficiency Award and the 1997 Chief of Naval Operations Ship-Helo Safety Award. Upon completion of the basic phase of training in preparation for her next deployment in support of the battle group Detroit then known as the \\"Dirty D\\" deployed for her 15th Mediterranean/Persian Gulf Deployment in November 1998. Responding to a national crisis, she sped her way from Earle, New Jersey to the Persian Gulf to complete the fastest transit in combat logistics force history. Detroit was key in Operation Desert Fox by providing ammunition, combat stores, fresh fruits and vegetables, and fuel to battle group units participating in the operation. On Thanksgiving Day, Detroit had the pleasure of hosting the Chief of Naval Operations for a brief visit while import Jebel Ali. During the deployment, Detroit was notified that she was awarded four individual \\"E‚Äôs\\" for excellence during 1998 in supply and logistics, mission area excellence, engineering and damage control, and operations and communications - a clean sweep in all mission areas. In May 1999, Detroit returned to her homeport. On 8 November 1999, Detroit began a four-month docking phased availability at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. =2000-2005= On 27 August 2000, Detroit was involved in a collision with approximately 100 miles off the Virginia Capes. Damage to both ships was minor. Detroit deployed with the Enterprise battle group to the Persian Gulf 2 October 2003 and returned to her homeport 1 March 2004. The USS Detroit was proclaimed as the Grand Champion of Fleet Week 2004 in New York City, New York on May 30, 2004. The Culinary Competition was held on board the USS Intrepid at the Sea, Air and Space Museum ‚Äì Technology Hall.

Detroit was decommissioned on 17 February 2005 and berthed at the inactive ships maintenance facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Detroit was brought to Port of Brownsville, Texas for final disposal in October 2005. The remains of the ship were sent to a scrap heap in Mexico. Ship's crest Crest of Detroit Detroit's emblem was constructed by a member of the ship's pre-commissioning crew. This was the rationale: 1\\\\. A profile of the first Detroit 2\\\\. A flaming mine to symbolize ordnance 3\\\\. A wheat-filled cornucopia to symbolize provisions 4\\\\. A fuel valve to symbolize petroleum products 5\\\\. Electron paths to symbolize the nuclear era 6\\\\. Five stars to represent the five ships named Detroit named in honor of the City of Detroit, Michigan 7\\\\. The ship's motto, Superare Optimum; \\"To Surpass the Finest.\\" The first Detroit was a 19-gun sloop captured from the British in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. Her black hull and white sails are set against a background of light blue sky and deep blue sea. The symbols for ordnance, provisions, and petroleum products are set along the electron paths that symbolize the modern nuclear age. These symbols reflect the mission of the fast combat support ship: to support naval forces at sea in the theater of operations.

He served as Vice President of Afghanistan under the Mujahideen from January 1993 to 1996. Biography Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi was born in 1920 in Baraki Barak district of the Logar Province. His grand father who migrated to Logar, was originally from the central Ghazni province. Mohammadi received his initial Islamic education from his religious father while he received secondary and high Islamic education from various, well-known scholars in the Logar Province in Afghanistan. In 1946 when he was 26, he finished all Islamic education and began to teach. Soon he got famous for his profound classical knowledge, intellectual enlightenment, practical wisdom and pure spirituality. Students from all around Afghanistan gathered around him and it were these students most of which later became a part of his Islamic Revolutionary Movement or Harakat-i- Inqilab-i-Islami and The Taliban Movement. This was during a time when Afghanistan had lost many of its Islamic traditions and communism was slowly beginning to spread throughout the country. He eventually contacted several Ulema and created a strong union of religious scholars with which to oppose Soviet propaganda and to attempt to inform the general population on the problems of communism. =Political activities= In 1958, some of the other scholars were already carrying out anti-communist activities Molvi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi Mojadidi family, began preaching against communism to people who would listen, traveling far and wide to many of the provinces in Afghanistan. In 1965, he was elected to the Afghan parliament from his home district of Barak-i-Barak in Logar Province representing the traditional religious scholars. As one of only a handful of religious scholars in the parliament, he took it upon himself to be a first line of defense against the Marxist deputies such as Babrak Karmal, Hafizullah Amin, Noor Ahad and Anahita Ratebzad and strongly opposed the Marxist movement in Afghanistan. Nabi's most famous experience in the parliament was the altercation with Babrak Karmal that led to Karmal being hospitalized. He is also known for a comprehensive speech in a parliament session that was played across Afghanistan via radio stations. File:Muhammadi Parliment.jpgMuhammadi with fellow Afghan Parliamentarians. =Coup= Daud Khan came to power at the end of the parliament session in a 1973 coup. When the parliament was dissolved by President Daud, Nabi Muhammadi returned to teaching in madrasas, first in Logar and then in Helmand. Another coup known as The Saur Revolution in 1978 brought Noor Mohammad Taraki to power. Saur Revolution (, ) (also written Sawr Revolution) is the name given to the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) takeover of political power from the government of Afghanistan on 28 April 1978. The coup was soon followed by imprisonment and mass killing of the prominent Afghan religious scholars, tribal leaders and reformers. After his brother Mullah Jan got captured, and who was later martyred by the Taraki Government, Muhamamd Nabi Muhammadi fled and migrated to Quetta city of neighboring Pakistan. There he proceeded to gather a large number of religious scholars in order to make qualified political and military activities inside Afghanistan against the Soviet occupation.http://aan- afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=2745 =Islamic Revolutionary Movement= The coup resulted in a massive disgorgement of Afghan religious leaders over the border to Pakistan. Most of these leaders congregated in Peshawar and tried to make contact with the leadership of two already established organization Hezb-e Islami and Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan which they had heard of prior to their arrival because of their declaration of jihad and clandestine distribution of publications critical of President Daud. Newly arrived members of the ulema urged the principals to reunify, but Rabbani and Hekmatyar each refused to accept the other's party as the umbrella. The compromise that was arrived at this time was the creation of a new alliance that was to be called Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami Afghanistan (The Islamic Revolutionary Movement of Afghanistan). After various candidates were proposed and rejected for the position of amir, the assembled members of the ulama decided in early September 1978 on Maulavi Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi as the leader of the new alliance. After nearly four months, engineer Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani separated from Harakat e Inqilab e Islami and founded their own parties by the name of Hizb-e-islami and Jamiat-e-islami. Molvi Mohammad Nabi carried the leadership of Harakat. Harakat e inqilabi islami was one of the seven parties that were officially recognized by the Pakistani government and was funded by the US and Arab countries through the Pakistani government. Mohammadi was among Afghan leaders who met President Reagan at the White House during the war. Reagan called the rebel leaders \\"freedom fighters.\\" Through continuous struggle the Afghan Mujahideen succeeded in their mission, and the Russian forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 after the loss of tens of thousands of its soldiers. In 1992 the pro-Moscow government in Kabul collapsed, and the Mujahideen took power. File:Molvi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi.jpgDuring Afghan Jihad in 1980s =Vice President= Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi became the Vice President of Afghanistan in the Mujahideen government. However, when the Mujahideen leaders opened their weapons at each other and the civil war in Afghanistan started, he resigned from his post and forbade the troops loyal to him from taking part in the war. He remained in Pakistan and tried his best to stop the war between Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Burhanuddin Rabbani and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. In 1996, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Most of the Taliban leaders were the students of Molvi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi. Mohammadi, however, maintained a good relationship with the Taliban. =Death= Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi died in Pakistani hospital on 21 April 2002. He had been suffering from tuberculosis. His body was brought to Logar, Afghanistan and was given a guard of honour by the government of Afghanistan.

While other robots would have to be instructed on each individual step of completing a larger task, Shakey could analyze commands and break them down into basic chunks by itself. Due to its nature, the project combined research in robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. Because of this, it was the first project that melded logical reasoning and physical action. Shakey was developed at the Artificial Intelligence Center of Stanford Research Institute (now called SRI International). Some of the most notable results of the project include the A* search algorithm, the Hough transform, and the visibility graph method. History Shakey was developed from approximately 1966 through 1972 with Charles Rosen as project manager. Other major contributors included Nils Nilsson, Alfred Brain, Sven Wahlstrom, Bertram Raphael, Richard Duda, Peter Hart, Richard Fikes, Richard Waldinger, Thomas Garvey, Jay Tenenbaum, Helen Chan Wolf and Michael Wilber. The project was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Now retired from active duty, Shakey is currently on view in a glass display case at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The project inspired numerous other robotics projects, most notably the Centibots. Software Shakey in 1972 The robot's programming was primarily done in LISP. The Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) planner it used was conceived as the main planning component for the software it utilized. As the first robot that was a logical, goal-based agent, Shakey experienced a limited world. A version of Shakey's world could contain a number of rooms connected by corridors, with doors and light switches available for the robot to interact with. Shakey had a short list of available actions within its planner. These actions involved traveling from one location to another, turning the light switches on and off, opening and closing the doors, climbing up and down from rigid objects, and pushing movable objects around. The STRIPS automated planner could devise a plan to enact all the available actions, even though Shakey himself did not have the capability to execute all the actions within the plan personally. An example mission for Shakey might be something like: \\"An operator types the command \\"push the block off the platform\\" at a computer console. Shakey looks around, identifies a platform with a block on it, and locates a ramp in order to reach the platform. Shakey then pushes the ramp over to the platform, rolls up the ramp onto the platform, and pushes the block off the platform. Mission accomplished.\\" Hardware Physically, the robot was particularly tall, and had an antenna for a radio link, sonar range finders, a television camera, on- board processors, and collision detection sensors (\\"bump detectors\\"). The robot's tall stature and tendency to shake resulted in its name: Research results Peter Hart discussed Shakey's firsts in a talk at Google in February 2015. The development of Shakey resulted in several results that have had far- reaching impact on the fields robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as computer science in general. Some of the more notable results include the development of the A* search algorithm, which is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently traversable path between points; the Hough transform, which is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing; and the visibility graph method for finding Euclidean shortest paths among obstacles in the plane.. Media and awards Shakey's creators at the IEEE Milestone award event at the Computer History Museum, February 2017: (from left) Richard O. Duda, Tom Garvey, IEEE President Elect Jim Jeffries, Peter E. Hart, Nils J. Nilsson, Richard Fikes, Helen Chan Wolff, Claude Fennema, Bertram Raphael, Mike Wilber. After SRI published a 24-minute video in 1969 entitled \\"SHAKEY: Experimentation in Robot Learning and Planning\\", the project received significant media attention. This included an April 10, 1969 article in the New York Times; In 1970, Life referred to Shakey as the \\"first electronic person\\"; and in November 1970 National Geographic Magazine covered Shakey and the future of computers. The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence's AI Video Competition's awards are named \\"Shakeys\\" because of the significant impact of the 1969 video. Shakey was inducted into Carnegie Mellon University's Robot Hall of Fame in 2004 alongside such notables as ASIMO and C-3PO. Shakey has been honored with a prestigious IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing. Shakey was showcased in the BBC ‚Äì Towards Tomorrow: Robot (1967) documentary.

History Bellahouston Estate in the parish of Govan was purchased in 1726 by James Rowan of Marylands and his family resided there until 1824. Upon the death of Thomas Rowan in that year, the estate passed to a relative by marriage, one Moses Steven of Polmadie. During his lifetime he increased the size of the estate, buying land at Weariston and a house and land at Dumbreck. The whole became known as Bellahouston. Upon the death of Moses in 1871, the Estate passed to his sisters who, according to his wishes, established a trust which would dedicate the estate for 'charitable, religious and educational purposes' within greater Glasgow. The trust became operative when Elizabeth Steven died in 1892. The Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 was held in Bellahouston Park and attracted over 13 million people. The park has been the focal point of the visits by two popes to the city of Glasgow: On 1 June 1982 Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass attended by around 250,000 worshippers (reputedly the largest crowd ever assembled in Scotland). Twenty eight years later on 16 September 2010 Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass close to the same spot as his predecessor. Bellahouston Park contains several sports facilities, including the Palace of Art, Sports for Excellence Centre, Bellahouston Sports Centre and the Glasgow Ski Centre (which is also home to Bellahouston Road Runners). The park also contains \\"House for an Art Lover\\" based on designs by architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, on which construction was completed in 1996. It was also the site of the futuristic Art Deco skyscraper, the Tait Tower, which was completed in 1938, but was subsequently demolished.

It was founded by Ian Allan (1922‚Äì2015). In 1942 Ian Allan, then working in the public relations department for the Southern Railway at Waterloo station, decided he could deal with many of the requests he received about rolling stock by collecting the information into a book.Interview for The Last Days of Steam, Timeshift BBC Four, broadcast 5 April 2012 The result was his first book, \\"ABC of Southern Locomotives\\". This proved to be a success, contributing to the emergence of trainspotting as a popular hobby in the UK, and leading to the formation of the company.Trainspotting explained and its rise and fall Rail.co.uk 20 October 2014 The company has grown from a small producer of books for train enthusiasts and spotters to a large transport publisher.

They moved to Wallace, Idaho where she oversaw the dining hall of the Wallace Hotel and her husband worked for the Northern Pacific Railroad. May and Al were part of a group of miners that struck it rich when discovering a vast silver mine.

She became a member of the Spokane Equal Suffrage Club and first vice-president of the Washington Equal Suffrage Association, which was then led by Emma Smith DeVoe. She became a well-known suffrage leader, but her outspoken style and unconventional behavior contrasted sharply with that of the more moderate Emma Smith DeVoe, a national suffrage organizer who was active in Tacoma, Olympia and Seattle. There was a great deal of conflict between the two, but they achieved their goal in 1910. Hutton attended the Democratic National Convention in 1912.

Life and career James was born in Hampton, Virginia. He directed the 1997 feature film Prefontaine and the TV movies Passing Glory and Joe and Max. One of his more recent films, The Interrupters, a portrayal of a year inside the lives of former gang members in Chicago who now intervene in violent conflicts, was released in January 2011, after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is his sixth feature length collaboration with his long-time filmmaking home, the non-profit Chicago production studio Kartemquin Films, and is also his fifth feature to be accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. While working with Kartemquin Films, James has produced many films that pursue social inquiry and change. Their collaborations include the 1994 hit Hoop Dreams, which is one of James' best known works. Kartemquin films, a non-profit group that produces films promoting \\"social inquiry\\", is based in Chicago. Much of James' work is based in the area, predominately the inner cities and impoverished areas. Their collaborations often touch on the topics of sports and race, including the ESPN 30 for 30 film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. On September 7, 2012, it was announced via social networking site Twitter that James would be involved in the making of a documentary on the life of film critic Roger Ebert which eventually became the 2014 effort Life Itself. He directed the documentary film Head Games which follows football player and wrestler Chris Nowinski's quest to uncover the truth about the consequences of sports related head injuries. Influences He is a graduate of James Madison University. His work, he tells journalist Robert K. Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life, was strongly influenced by the Oscar-winning film Harlan County, USA: > There've been many documentaries over the years that have powerfully > impacted me. I think this one came along at the time when I was more > interested in being a feature filmmaker than a documentary filmmaker. So it > came along at the beginning of a process of moving from an interest in > feature film to documentaries, and that's where my career has taken me. It > came along at the right time for me. It helped me see, \\"Ah, this is more > what I want to do.\\" James also pulls influence from the original definition of the term cin√©ma v√©rit√© as it applies to the Rouch/Morin method of filmmaking. Just as with Rouch and Morin, the \\"people on camera and we in the audience are continually reminded that a film is being made, that we are watching a film.\\" We are reminded of this through James' presence on screen as well as his cinematic editing techniques, in order to obtain, what he believes is a more accurate depiction of truth.

It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self- awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence. As described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the bias results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, \\"the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.\\" Colloquially, people experiencing this bias are said to be at the top of \\"Mount Stupid,\\" although this is not used in scientific articles about the Dunning-Kruger effect. Original study The psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study, \\"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\\". The identification derived from the cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who, on April 19, 1995, robbed two banks while his face was covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make it invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an invisible ink. Other investigations of the phenomenon, such as \\"Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence\\" (2003), indicate that much incorrect self-assessment of competence derives from the person's ignorance of a given activity's standards of performance. Dunning and Kruger's research also indicates that training in a task, such as solving a logic puzzle, increases people's ability to accurately evaluate how good they are at it. In Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself (2005), Dunning described the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect as \\"the anosognosia of everyday life\\", referring to a neurological condition in which a disabled person either denies or seems unaware of his or her disability. He stated: \\"If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent ... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is.\\" In 2011, Dunning wrote about his observations that people with substantial, measurable deficits in their knowledge or expertise lack the ability to recognize those deficits and, therefore, despite potentially making error after error, tend to think they are performing competently when they are not: \\"In short, those who are incompetent, for lack of a better term, should have little insight into their incompetence‚Äîan assertion that has come to be known as the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect\\". In 2014, Dunning and Helzer described how the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect \\"suggests that poor performers are not in a position to recognize the shortcomings in their performance\\". Later studies Dunning and Kruger tested the hypotheses of the cognitive bias of illusory superiority on undergraduate students of introductory courses in psychology by examining the students' self-assessments of their intellectual skills in logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, abductive), English grammar, and personal sense of humor. After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning, overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile. Moreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to estimate their class rank correctly after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception. The study \\"Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability\\" (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of illusory superiority to test subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their own perceptions of other people. The study \\"How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance\\" (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues. The participants' knowledge of geography was tested; some tests were intended to affect the participants' self-view positively and some were intended to affect it negatively. The participants then were asked to rate their performances; the participants given tests with a positive intent reported better performance than did the participants given tests with a negative intent. To test Dunning and Kruger's hypotheses, \\"that people, at all performance levels, are equally poor at estimating their relative performance\\", the study \\"Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons\\" (2006) investigated three studies that manipulated the \\"perceived difficulty of the tasks, and, hence, [the] participants' beliefs about their relative standing\\". The investigation indicated that when the experimental subjects were presented with moderately difficult tasks, there was little variation among the best performers and the worst performers in their ability to predict their performance accurately. With more difficult tasks, the best performers were less accurate in predicting their performance than were the worst performers. Therefore, judges at all levels of skill are subject to similar degrees of error in the performance of tasks. In testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study \\"Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent\\" (2008), reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, \\"poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve\\". Individuals of relatively high social class are more overconfident than lower- class individuals. Mathematical critique The Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is a statement about a particular disposition of human behavior, but it also makes quantitative assertions that rest on mathematical arguments. The effect relies on the quantifying of paired measures consisting of (a) the measure of the competence people can demonstrate when put to the test (actual competence) and (b) the measure of competence people believe that they have (self-assessed competence). Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment. A 2008 study by Joyce Ehrlinger summarized the major assertions of the effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \\"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\\". The effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures, The most common graphical convention is the Kruger‚ÄìDunning type graph used in the seminal paper. That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the effect. Additional graphs used by other researchers who argued for the legitimacy of the effect include (y-x) versus (x) cross plots and bar charts. The first two of these studies depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competence in introductory chemistry, and the third depicted their accuracy in self-assessing their competence in business classes. Recent researchers who focused on the mathematical reasoning behind the effect studied 1,154 participants' ability to self-assess their competence in understanding the nature of science. These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions, driven by ceiling/floor effects (exacerbated by measurement error) causing censoring. To expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1,154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior. The researchers then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence. But the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper and the Numeracy researchers' real data were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \\"self- assessment signal.\\" The researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self- assessments. About half of the 1,154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within ¬±10 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within ¬±15 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5,000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency. Groups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self- assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence. A third Numeracy paper by these researchers reports from a database of over 3000 participants to illuminate the effects of privilege on different ethnic and gender groups of college students. The paper confirms that minority groups are on average less privileged and score lower in the cognitive test scores and self-assessed confidence ratings on the instruments used in this research. They verified that women on average self-assessed more accurately than men, and did so across all ethnic groups that had sufficient representation in the researchers' database. Cultural differences in self- perception Studies of the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect. The study \\"Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self- improving Motivations and Malleable Selves\\" (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group. Popular recognition In 2000, Kruger and Dunning were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of the scientific work recorded in \\"their modest report\\". \\"The Dunning‚ÄìKruger Song\\" is part of The Incompetence Opera, a mini-opera that premiered at the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017. The mini-opera is billed as \\"a musical encounter with the Peter principle and the Dunning‚ÄìKruger Effect\\".

Their relationship began when she was seventeen years old; he was 45 and still living with his first wife, Olga Khokhlova. It ended when Picasso moved on to his next relationship, with artist Dora Maar. In Picasso's paintings, Walter appears as blonde, sunny and bright, as in Le R√™ve (1932), in contrast to his darker portrayal of Dora Maar, whom Picasso painted as the tortured \\"weeping woman\\".

Author Herbert T. Schwartz dates their first meeting back to January 1925 at Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris; whereas author Roy MacGregor-Hastie dates the encounter up to 8 January 1928. At the time Picasso was married to Olga Khokhlova, a Russian ballerina, with whom he had a five- year-old son. He and Walter, then seventeen years old, began a relationship which was kept secret from his wife until 1935. From 1927 onwards, Walter lived close to Picasso's family, who lived in an apartment provided by and next door to his art dealer and friend, Paul Rosenberg, in Rue La Bo√©tie. From 1930, she stayed in a house opposite Picasso's at Rue La Bo√©tie 44.famsf.org, \\"Picasso: The Women Behind the Artist\\" In July 1930, Picasso bought a castle at Boisgeloup close to Gisors in the Normandie, which he used as a studio for sculptures mainly.

When Picasso's then-wife Olga was informed by a friend that her husband had a longtime relationship with a woman who was expecting a child, she immediately left Picasso and moved to the South of France with their son, Paulo. Picasso and Olga never divorced, although Picasso was intent on it and explored the legal possibilities, Olga was \\"bitterly opposed to the whole thing\\"O'Brian, Patrick, Picasso, Collins, 1989, p. 299; instead she impounded his work until he came to terms eventually paying her a large allowanceO'Brian, Patrick, Picasso, Collins, 1989, p. 300, they lived separately until her death in 1955. On 5 September 1935, Picasso and Marie's daughter, Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n, called \\"Maya\\", was born. Marie and Maya stayed with Picasso at Juan-les-Pins in the South of France from 25 March to 14 May, 1936, and then at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre, from Versailles, where Picasso visited on the weekends and some weekdays to play with his daughter. Maya also modeled for some of his paintings, including Maya with Doll (1938). Marie-Th√©r√®se became jealous when Picasso fell in love with Dora Maar, a surrealist photographer and model for Picasso, in 1935. Once, she and Maar met accidentally in Picasso's studio when he was painting Guernica. Asked about this in later life, Picasso allegedly remarked that he had been quite happy with the situation and that when they demanded that he choose between them, he told them that they would have to fight it out themselves, at which point the two women began to wrestle. The art historian and friend of Picasso, John Richardson, says this story was not true, that both Dora Maar and Picasso told him it never happened and there is no direct evidence that it ever did. More likely the event is imagined from the pictorial representation of Walter and Maar who appear as if in battle at opposite ends of the composition of Guernica.Richardson, John, Picasso, Magic Sex and Death, Channel 4, 2001 Whereas Picasso portrays Dora in his works of art as dark and in pain, as The Weeping Woman, he painted Marie-Th√©r√®se as just the opposite, blonde and bright.Sothebys, Simon Shaw, \\"Reign of the Blonde Muse: An Interview with Diana Widmaier-Picasso\\", 17 Oct 2012 = Later years and death = In 1940, Marie and Maya moved to Paris, Boulevard Henri IV no 1, since the house at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre was occupied during World War II.

Western Christianity It is one of the four ways approved in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church for administering Holy Communion under the form of wine as well as of bread: \\"The norms of the Roman Missal admit the principle that in cases where Communion is administered under both kinds, 'the Blood of the Lord may be received either by drinking from the chalice directly, or by intinction, or by means of a tube or a spoon' (General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 245). As regards the administering of Communion to lay members of Christ's faithful, the Bishops may exclude Communion with the tube or the spoon where this is not the local custom, though the option of administering Communion by intinction always remains. If this modality is employed, however, hosts should be used which are neither too thin nor too small, and the communicant should receive the Sacrament from the Priest only on the tongue\\" (General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 285b and 287).Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum, 103 \\"The communicant must not be permitted to intinct the host himself in the chalice, nor to receive the intincted host in the hand. As for the host to be used for the intinction, it should be made of valid matter, also consecrated; it is altogether forbidden to use non-consecrated bread or other matter.\\"Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum, 104 Intinction occurs in some Old Catholic Churches, and intinction is common in some Anglican Churches, which often give the communicant the choice of drinking from the chalice or receiving by intinction. In many Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopal, and Methodist churches the communicant, not the minister, dips the host in the chalice. This is the practice in some Baptist and Congregational Churches as well, often using grape juice in place of wine. In 2009, one diocese of the Anglican Church of Canada banned intinction in the belief that it can spread disease. Eastern Christianity In the Eastern Orthodox Church, leavened bread is employed for the Eucharist. Traditionally, the consecrated bread is placed in the chalice and is given together with the consecrated wine directly into the communicant's mouth with a small spoon. Some of the Byzantine-rite Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with the Church of Rome adopted intinction during the early 20th century, dividing the bread into pieces long enough to be partially dipped in the consecrated wine and placed on the communicant's tongue. This is the practice at least of the Melkite Greek Catholic ChurchDick, Ignatios. Melkites: Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholics of the Patriarchates of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem. Newton, MA: Sophia Press, 2004, p. 147; photographs of Divine Liturgy at Melkite church in Heliopolis, Egypt and the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church.Video clip on the site of the Greek Catholic Exarchate Some Eastern Catholic Churches (for instance, the Ethiopic Rite Catholics of Ethiopia and Eritrea) have adopted the use of unleavened bread, justifying it by reference to the ancient Jewish practice of using only unleavened bread at Passover meals, and give Communion by intinction. The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts Eastern Orthodox practice with regard to the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts has varied historically and geographically. At this Liturgy, which is customarily used only on weekdays of Great Lent, no prayers of consecration take place but communion is distributed with bread with wine poured into it that were consecrated and reserved at the Divine Liturgy the Sunday before. Wine is placed in the chalice at the Presanctified Liturgy, and the presanctified Eucharist is placed into the wine. In the Greek and ancient Russian practice, this is understood as a \\"second consecration\\" in which the wine then becomes consecrated by contact with the consecrated bread that has had the consecrated wine poured into it on the previous Sunday In modern Russian practice, however, it is not considered consecrated. It is said to remain ordinary wine and is used only to facilitate swallowing the bread and so that the people can receive Communion in their customary way. This view is a subject of some controversy. The already consecrated bread used in this Liturgy has been united, at the time it is reserved, with the consecrated wine by placing some of the consecrated wine on the bread with the spoon. In the Russian tradition the wine is placed so that it traces out a cross. Also in the Russian tradition, whichever of the ministers is to consume the remaining elements at the end of the Presanctified Liturgy partakes of the bread alone when he receives Communion at that service and does not drink from the chalice so that he does not break his pre-Communion fast. The Greek (and ancient Russian) tradition is that the wine in the cup is sanctified, once a portion of the bread, on which consecrated wine has previously been poured, is placed in it at the \\"union\\" after the Fraction.

It is adjacent to the Erieview Tower, a 40-story office building. The Galleria is a few blocks away from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  History  The concept for the Galleria began in 1985, when Richard E. Jacobs, who had just bought the Cleveland Indians baseball team, also bought the Tower at Erieview, which had opened in 1964. Jacobs began planning to convert the plaza that lay in front of the tower into a shopping center to serve the Cleveland area. The result was the Galleria, a glass-enclosed mall, opened in late 1987. It was the first major retail venture in Downtown Cleveland since the 1920s. The Galleria, which helped spark Cleveland's downtown revitalization in the 1990s, had become very empty due to its lack of a department store anchor and its perception as being far from the center of Downtown action. In 2005, the mall had only 36 tenants out of a possible 66. In 2003, The Galleria and Tower at Erieview were purchased by Werner Minshall, who made a proposal to close the mall and convert it into a convention center. This did not happen and Minshall changed his approach to try to revive the mall by filling it with local tenants. So far, this plan has been very slow to develop, but it has seen success: a few area businesses have bought retail space, and several area vendors set up stands during the week and sell their goods. There are a few non-retail businesses and groups on the second floor. Another feature of the Galleria is its food court, which attracts downtown workers on weekdays. At one point, the Galleria was noted for the business \\"Gardens under Glass\\", an urban farm beneath the mall's atrium. Gardens under Glass closed in 2013. More recently, the Parker Hannifin Downtown YMCA has moved in to occupy a considerable portion of the Galleria and is now open. In 2019, James Kassouf and a group of investors purchased the property for $17.7 million.

The problem arises because public goods belong to society as a whole, and are generally not traded in the market. Because market prices cannot be used to value them, researchers ask a sample of people how much they are willing to pay for the public good, wildlife preservation for example. The results can be misleading because of the difficulty, for individual society members, of identifying the particular value that they attach to one particular thing which is embedded in a collection of similar things (e.g. The Tower of London within the set of all globally important historic monuments or Caernarvon Castle within the set of all Welsh Scheduled Monuments). A similar problem occurs with a wider selection of public goods (for example whether spending on preserving a specific wetland is more important than preserving a specific persons life for the next two years using taxpayers' money). The embedding effect suggests the contingent valuation method is not an unbiased approach to measuring policy impacts for cost-benefit analysis of environmental, and other government policies. Policy implications Few government policies are independent of any other governmental policy. Most policies involve either substitute or complementary relationships with others at either the same or different intergovernmental level. For example, the protection of coastal water quality is a goal of both state and multiple federal agencies. The Clean Water Act, wetlands protection programs, and fisheries management plans all address coastal water quality. These policies may be substitutes or complements for each other. These relationships complicate the application of the contingent valuation method. The resulting problems that may be encountered have been called the part-whole bias and sequencing and nesting (see below). One method of overcoming some aspects of this problem is to ask two questions (1) How much would you be willing to contribute to a specific tax fund for the whole set of items to be preserved? (e.g. all Coral Sea areas west of Australia) followed by (2) How much of this would you like to give to the preservation of the specific named item? (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef). These questions may also be supplemented by questions which ask about the respective importance of alternatives e.g. whether the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef is more/the same/less important than other public goods such as poor relief, health care, education etc. Part-Whole Bias If the contingent valuation method is used to elicit willingness to pay for two government policies independently (the parts) the sum of the independently estimated willingness to pay amounts may be different from the willingness to pay elicited for both projects (the whole). This result is troubling if the projects are geographically related, for example, different wilderness areas (McFadden, 1994). This result does not violate the nonsatiation axiom of consumer theory if projects are perfect substitutes (Carson and Mitchell, 1995). Several applications of the contingent valuation method have found an absence of part-whole bias (e.g., Whitehead, Haab, and Huang, 1998). Sequencing and Nesting A related issue occurs with the sequential valuation of projects. Consider a two-part policy valued in two different sequences. The willingness to pay for a project when valued first will be larger than when the question is placed second. Independent valuation, in effect valuing each project at the beginning of a sequence, will always lead to the largest of the possible willingness to pay estimates. This result is expected for the value of public goods estimated with the contingent valuation method due to substitution and income effects (Hoehn and Randall, 1989; Carson, Flores, and Hanemann, 1998).

Dmitri Lipskerov is a winner of the Moscow Komsomol Prize and also the youngest member of the Soviet Writers Union, which he joined in 1989. In 1991 he had left the Soviet Union to go to the US, where he lived until 1993. Following the above-mentioned events, Dmitri had turned away from writing plays. The journal Noviy Mir published the writer's first novel Sorok let Chanchzhoe (The Forty Years of Chanchzhoeh) appeared in Novyi Mir in 1996, and the following year was published by Vagrius. The novel quickly gained fame and was included in the shortlist of the Russian Booker Award. In 1997-1998 he was the author of the television game Zolotaya Likhoradka (Gold Rush), which appeared on ORT. In 1998 Lipskerov together with a state deputy Andrey Skoch became a co-founder of the Debut prize for works of fiction by young Russian writers. During the first year, he was head of the jury as well as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 2000-2001 Vagrius published the author's three-volume of works and later in 2002 ‚Äì a five-volume collection of works in the publishing house Exmo-Press. In 2004 the publishing house Olma-Press releases another three-volume of works. AST joined in by publishing an eight- volume collection in 2007 and a five-volume collection later in the years. Altogether, Dmitri Lipskerov is an author of 11 novels, dozens of tales and stories, adding to more than 20 plays. In 2006-2010 Dmitri was a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation in the position of a Deputy Chairman of the Commission on Culture. In 2008 he established a literature prize Neformat. The president thanked Dmitri Lipskerov for his contribution to the development of domestic literature and active social activity. The author rarely gives interviews, preferring a concealed lifestyle. A little-known fact about Dmitri is that his book Vsyakiy Kapitan Primadonna (Any Captain is a Primadonna) was published after Dmitri himself sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, from the Caribbean to Europe, having never before had any experience sailing. The book includes comical snippets that are excerpts from his real- life experience of crossing the Atlantic with only two other people on board. Lipskerov lives in Moscow, and in addition to his literary work, is known as a successful restaurant owner. Dmitri's most prominent restaurant, cleverly named, Ris i Riba (Rice and Fish) was one of the largest and oldest, and widely regarded as one of the best sushi establishments in Moscow and all of Russia. He has two children: Konstantin and Sofia. Controversy On June 3, 2005, Lipskerov (together with radio personality A.Gordon) has circulated an \\"Open letter to journalists of radio station Echo of Moscow\\" Site of 'Human rights Organization', in Russian expressing support for state-run campaign against Mikhail Khodorkovsky directed on takeover of his oil company Yukos which culminated in Khodorkovski's conviction and imprisonment. In subsequent discussions Transcript from Russian Radio Liberty there followed allegations of revival of Soviet tradition of KGB-orchestrated participation of intelligentsia in 'public campaign of protest' along with staged show trials.

The College is divided in the units of Arts and Sciences and the Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The College is located on the River Campus of the University of Rochester, though some departments maintain facilities on other campuses. The College was established in 1955 upon the merger of the separate colleges for men and women at the university. Undergraduate academics The Genesee River Flags denote the home countries of students currently attending the college Main quadrangle Walkway between Rush Rhees library and the Frederick Douglass building Undergraduate education at the College has no required subjects or core curriculum common to all students. The only class that resembles a requirement is WRT 105 or Reasoning and Writing in the College, which serves as the primary writing requirement, though it is not required with certain test scores. It is also not a single class, but rather a set of courses with different subjects to allow for diversity of interest. All undergraduates are required to pursue study in three areas of knowledge: humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Aside from a concentration, which falls into one of the areas of study, undergraduate students must complete at least one \\"cluster\\" of related courses (usually 3-4 courses) within each of the remaining areas. For example, a student with a concentration in mathematics, a natural science field, must complete at least one cluster in the humanities and one in social sciences. A second concentration or a minor also satisfies this requirement. The only exceptions are students concentrating in an accredited engineering field (biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, electrical and computer engineering or mechanical engineering), who are only required to have one cluster in either humanities or social sciences. Tuition and financial aid 2013-14 River Campus undergraduate tuition is estimated at $45,372. Total charges (including room and board, fees, books, and personal expenses) is approximately $61,340.University of Rochester Financial aid page More than $40 million is given in financial aid (does not include federal and state grants and loans). Most Rochester undergraduates receive some form of financial assistance, including academic merit scholarships. More than 95 percent of Ph.D. students receive financial aid, usually enough to cover tuition and living expenses. Departments and concentrations Students may take courses from any of the many departments within the College. Each department may offer concentrations, minors, clusters or other degree programs. There are also many interdepartmental programs and students have the option of creating their own courses of study with a special application.

According to the Documentation of the human population of the territory, the Imraguen people lived on the Banc d'Arguin National Park for thousands of years, and its population had probably been larger. Militarily powerless, the Imraguen were traditionally reduced to the degrading lower-caste status of Znaga, forcibly ruled and taxed (horma) by more powerful Berber, Hassane and Zawia tribes, such as the Oulad Delim and Ouled Bou Sbaa. In 2008, the Imraguen people occupied 9 small villages along the coastline.

The Imraguen people are the only ones authorized to fish in the Banc d'Arguin area, as long as they use their traditional fishing techniques. The number of fishes caught for each species is limited and strongly reinforced by the Mauritanian authorities. In 2004, the Imraguen people agreed to preserve the shark and ray species in the Banc d'Arguin National Park (which became a UNESCO world heritage site in 1989) and traded their nets for money. The Imraguen people blame the new oil and gas explorations around the Banc d'Arguin area, along with a new road adjacent to the area, as the main factors for the reduction of fish reproduction in the area. At the Arkeiss village, it is possible for tourists to practice \\"sports fishing\\" in the Banc d'Arguin and gather up to 5 kilos of fish.

It is located along the South Saskatchewan River downstream from Gardiner Dam and the Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station. History Settlement of the area began in the early 1900s with farmers and immigrants moving into the area looking for farmland. Outlook officially started as a settlement on August 26, 1908 when the Canadian Pacific Railway commenced the auction of lots. On November 23, 1908 the citizens of Outlook welcomed the first train which arrived from Moose Jaw. Within the month the CPR was running a tri-weekly train service carrying huge piles of lumber, however the supply of workers and materials was far outweighed by the demand for more buildings. The Outlook CPR Station building was built in 1909 and a year later, on November 1, 1910, Outlook was officially declared a town. In 1912 the Skytrail bridge crossing the South Saskatchewan River was finished, allowing both passenger and commercial traffic to cross the river in the area for the first time without using the ferry. DemographicsArts and culture Outlook's arts program includes the Equinox Theatre, a community theatre group that puts on one to two productions a year. They have put on such productions such as Anne of Green Gable(starring Marcia Orton as Anne, and Alexander Haugen as Gilbert) and The Little Mermaid (starring Madeline Codling as Ariel, and Gavin Fleck as Prince Eric). In the past, the group would work in Conjunction with the LCBI theatre group. The Outlook and District Community Arts Council recently opened an art gallery in the Town Office Building.

Geography Map of civil parish of Helsby within the former borough of Vale Royal The village is situated on the A56 main road between Chester and Runcorn. The neighbouring settlements are Dunham-on-the-Hill, Frodsham, Elton and Alvanley. Helsby is a semi-rural village, with many dairy and arable farms, but is also in close proximity to a number of industrial plants around the Mersey estuary including the former Royal Dutch Shell Stanlow oil refinery (now Essar) the Quinn Glass manufacturing plant, the Kemira fertiliser plant on Ince Marshes and the chemical manufacturing site (previously ICI chemicals, now Ineos Chlor) and power station at Rocksavage. There are few jobs in Helsby itself, due to the larger surrounding cities of Chester and Runcorn offering better prospects and a wider range of careers. The Tesco supermarket is one of the biggest employers in Helsby. The village is popular with commuters as a residential area, due to its links to the M56 motorway and rail networks. History On Helsby Hill, the remains of a promontory hillfort, 1.9ha in area, have been excavated. A buried soil was found under the hillfort containing fossilised pollen dating to the late Mesolithic to early Neolithic, between 7000 and 3001BC.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH8237 Revealing Cheshire's Past HER number 1007/2 Further evidence suggests a burning episode dating to the early Neolithic occupation or woodland clearance dating to 4000BC to 2351 BC.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH22371 Revealing Cheshire's Past HER number 1007/1 The bivallate hillfort is protected on the south and east by two parallel ramparts and an unusual type of inturned entrance 11 yards (10 m) wide. There were three phases of hillfort construction at Helsby. The first stone rampart was constructed in the middle to late Bronze Age (1250-1050 cal BC) and consisted of a bank of well dressed, outer face of sandstone blocks and an irregular inner face, which was built on a slight batter; it was approximately 4 yards (3.5m) wide. A socketed bronze axe found at Helsby in 1925.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH8042 Revealing Cheshire's Past HER number 1004 This was followed by a series of colluvial deposits against the internal face of the stone rampart that formed the second phase of activity. The third and final phase was the re-building of the rampart in the post-Roman period, dating as late as 530 AD suggesting early Saxon re-occupation of the hillfort.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH8237 Reveal Cheshire's Past HER number 1007/2 Helsby was located on the strategically important Roman road between Chester and Wilderspool near Warrington. The road existed between c. 79‚Äì410 AD to link the garrison of Deva to Wilderspool, which produced pottery that supplied the north west of England.http://potsherd.net/atlas/Ware/WPMO Potsherd ‚Äì Atlas of Roman Pottery The Roman road passed at the foot of Helsby Hill probably following the route of Old Chester Road. Helsby Hill and Woodhouse Hillfort 2010 On the top of the hill a Roman bronze sestertius of the emperor Tiberius minted in Rome in AD22 was found and just off Vicarage Lane in 1958, an uninscribed Roman altar of red sandstone was discovered with a carved jug on one side and an axe and knife on the other.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH7695 Revealing Cheshire's Past HER number 1008 The first known settlers of Helsby were the Vikings in the 10th century. In fact, the name 'Helsby' is likely to be derived from the Viking name Hjallr-by, meaning \\"the village on the edge\\" (placenames with the suffix \\"by\\" often denote Viking/Danish origins, e.g. Derby, Grimsby, Whitby, etc.). However, Old Norse suggests that Hjalli means edge and Hjallr means constructed platform or scaffold.http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Hjalli Nordic names The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the Norman name of Hellesbe. The Manor of Helsby was owned by a series of aristocratic landowners, most recently the Marquis of Cholmondeley. In the 13th century Helsby was deemed a demesne manor under the lordship of Dunham-on-the-Hill, by a family called Hellesby. Later it passed to Thornton and then to Frodsham. The earliest mention of the original, timber Old Hall, was in a contract for the construction of additional work in stone in the mid 15th century. The wooden part of the hall perished in a fire in the 16th century when it was leased to one of the Hatons of Helsby. The later hall probably derived its name from its proximity to the older site. It was built of brick at the end of the 18th century and was used as a farmhouse.http://rcplive.cheshire.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MCH7697 Revealing Cheshire's Past HER number 1012/1 Helsby Hill was the location of a rare public execution when William Henry Clarke was hung in chains on 21 April 1791 after being convicted of robbing the Warrington Mail.http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution-content.php?key=9920 British Executions In 1968, Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Welsh Defence Movement), a Welsh republican movement, blew up a water pipe at Hapsford near Helsby. The water pipe was carrying water from Chester to Liverpool. Community A Methodist church was established in 1800, 70 years before the Anglican church was built in 1870. Helsby is home to two primary schools (Helsby Hillside and Hornsmill) that serve the east and west of the village respectively with the former being in close proximity to one of the most successful secondary schools in Cheshire: Helsby High School. The village was once home to many pubs, the majority of which were adjacent to the A56 road. In the centre of the village, the Railway Inn currently offers Greenalls cask ale and is frequently host to live music; it recently changed licensee and a refurbishment is rumoured for January 2018. The old Helsby train station waiting rooms houses the very popular Beer Heroes craft ale Tap Room which provides a vast library of craft ales to buy and take away, as well as beers on draft. Two other pubs, the Robin Hood and the Horse & Jockey, were acquired by developers for conversion to residential properties. On 23 September 2011, the Robin Hood pub caught fire, causing roads to be closed throughout the village for some hours, and subsequently the building(s) were demolished. The Horse & Jockey was demolished in 2019 and a housing development has been built. The pub sign is to be displayed in the local community centre. On the western edge of the village is the Horns Mill (formerly the Helsby Arms and before that the Brown Cow), a pub and restaurant that has changed hands on several occasions during recent years, and also closed down briefly, but reopened in January 2014. The village has been in the press for its hugely successful community Christmas event, Ho Ho Helsby, which was held for the second time on 2 December 2017. There was an estimated attendance of 2,500 people enjoying artisan stalls, ice skating, reindeer, live music from local musicians on stage all day and a twilight procession of floats featuring local schools, community groups and businesses. The village is known for its community spirit, epitomised in the fund raising efforts for Ho Ho Helsby which is entirely voluntary, as well as knitted angels which are hidden around the village in the run up to Christmas Day. The village also has its own craft beer, Ho Ho Helsbeer, brewed in a brewery less than two miles away. Behind the Railway Inn is the Courtyard, Helsby, a development of holiday cottages in period barn conversions offering a place to stay in the village, close to the North Cheshire Way footpath. There is also \\"Homestead Boutique Cottages\\" offering accommodation on Lower Robin Hood Lane. Future It has been proposed that a waste incinerator be constructed at Ince Marshes, near Helsby. A public inquiry was held and as a result the Government has given permission to build it. Transport=Railway services= The railway came to Helsby in 1850, with the construction of the line between Chester and Warrington. Helsby railway station has won awards as one of the best kept unmanned stations in the UK. The signal box at Helsby Junction is still operated manually. Services are operated at approximately hourly intervals by Transport for Wales to Manchester Piccadilly and in the other direction to Chester and Llandudno. There is also a minimal (Parliamentary) service operated by Northern to neighbouring Ince & Elton and Stanlow & Thornton with trains terminating at Ellesmere Port where a connection is made with the Merseyrail electric service to Liverpool. =Bus services= There are frequent bus links: X30 (Warrington to Chester), and X2 (Runcorn to Ellesmere Port). All these run Monday to Saturday only. Industry The factory site at the western end of the village has for many years been the main source of employment in the village. Originally built in the 1880s by the Telegraph Manufacturing Company, as the Britannia Telegraph Works, the factory was used to manufacture cables, and was most recently owned by BICC Electronic Cables. It employed up to 5,000 people at its peak (from the Second World War until 1970), but continued to decline following a series of redundancy initiatives started in 1970, and the site eventually closed in 2002. The site was then redeveloped for retail, light industrial and residential purposes. The first completed development on the site was a Tesco supermarket, which opened in September 2005. In 2005 cable manufacturing returned to Helsby when Heat Trace Limited, a British specialist cable manufacturer, took over one of the last remaining industrial buildings on the site to expand their operations, taking advantage of the existence of the electron beaming unit on the site for the irradiation of their specialist heating cables. Landmarks=Helsby Hill= Helsby Hill The village sits at the foot of a wooded sandstone hill above sea level. Helsby Hill has steep cliffs on the northern and western sides and is a prominent landmark rising above the Cheshire Plain and overlooking the Mersey estuary. Much of the hill is owned and managed by the National Trust. It is the site of Helsby hill fort, an ancient British hillfort, and more recently acquired a concrete pillar trig point on its summit. The top of the hill also has a former Royal Observer Corps post, which was abandoned in 1992. Visitors who see Helsby Hill from the M56 or on the train can sometimes see a man's face within the cliff face from east, west and sometimes from the north. This is referred to as the \\"Old Man of Helsby\\". ;Access to hill Numerous footpaths, running from the public roads encircling the hill, give ready access for walkers. One such path, known as Hill Road, runs through a large sandstone cutting, which was the route of a railway in the Second World War. The hilltop offers views of the Welsh hills and, on exceptionally clear days, Snowdon. The landmarks of Liverpool can clearly be seen beyond the Helsby marshes, Stanlow Oil Refinery, Kemira Fertiliser Plant and the Manchester Ship Canal. Also on very clear days, visitors can see across Lancashire, past Bolton, to Winter Hill; in mid- morning (when the sun is reflecting off it), it is often possible to see the large white section on top of the Winter Hill TV Mast. The view looking back is not as diverse, but the Peckforton Hills and Beeston Castle can be discerned. During the particularly dry summer of 2018 a wild fire on top of the hill was visible for many miles. Mainly gorse and bracken the fire blazed over the cliff face and was contained after many hours. ;Rock climbing The craggy face of the hill provides many routes for rock climbers at a range of grades from easy climbs suitable for beginners (some of which do not require ropes), to challenging climbs up to a grade 6c. The cliff is also split into two lateral sections. The main face is easily accessible from the ground. At the top is a large grassy area, followed by an easily accessible 10-foot (or thereabouts) cliff to the summit, which is excellent for bouldering. Despite its often slimy appearance, the cliff's sandstone composition means it dries out quickly after rain, and, after several accidents, several large metal spikes were placed at the top of the main cliff for top-rope climbing that offer extra safety for climbers worried about the sandstone's crumbly nature. =Mountskill Quarry= 200px Sandstone was extracted from a working quarry from the early 19th century until the 1920s. Much of the stone was transported by ferry to Liverpool and Birkenhead, where several buildings, including the Customs House near Canning Dock, were built of Helsby stone. The quarry originally had its own dedicated horse-drawn tramway link to Ince Pier. After stone production ceased, it was not until the late 1980s that an alternative use was found for the site and in the intervening decades the derelict site was used as a tip by local residents. The site was acquired by the former Vale Royal Borough Council in 1988 and transformed into a woodland park, which was opened in 1990. 'Helsby Quarry Woodland Park' is now managed by Cheshire West and Chester Council. It contains a range of trees including oak, sycamore, rowan, silver birch, willow and beech‚Äîsome of which grew naturally during the site's period of dereliction, and some of which were planted specifically in preparing the woodland park. The woodland and grassland are inhabited by many animal and bird species. Aside from the wildlife, the geology of the site is one of its most significant features and it is designated a Regionally Important Geological Site. The site features exposed rock walls and a tunnel, which enable sandstone formations from the Triassic period (251‚Äì199 million years ago) to be viewed.  Notable people  * J.

Hunter : Racing Calendar - Page xxv 1842 December 20, 1796April 21, 1850), was a Hungarian statesman, leader of the upper house of the Diet, member of the Board of Academy of Sciences, hero of the 1838 Pest flood. A prominent and wealthy Hungarian aristocrat, son of Baron Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi and Ilona Cserei, he was born at Zsib√≥ (now Jibou), and was educated at his father's castle by M√≥zes Pataky in a liberal and patriotic direction. He inherited his father's physical strength, and he further trained himself in different sports, such as horse-riding and swimming. He was a celebrity in his age for his sportsman's accomplishments. Early career Wessel√©nyi entered politics in 1818, taking minor positions at numerous County Diets, as was customary with the upper nobility his family belonged to. He went on a grand tour of Western Europe with his friend, Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi in 1821 and 1822. Realizing their native Hungary's need to catch up with the development of other European states, they become leading figures of the progressive opposition in the Upper House, promoting a program of reform and economic and national development. Hungary was under the foreign rule of the Habsburg emperors, who treated any native reform movement with deep suspicion. The Habsburg government, fearing unrest and independence efforts, took increasingly oppressive measures to curb the nationalist movement. Accomplishments Wessel√©nyi abolished several feudal laws and customs on his own estates, freed his serfs, built and ran schools on his own money, and organized lectures on modern agriculture for his former subjects. He established a printing press in Kolozsv√°r to promote his ideas. In 1833 he published a political book titled Prejudices (Bal√≠t√©letek), which was immediately banned by the Habsburg government. In the Diet of 1834, he became one of the political leaders of the opposition. He held several speeches on current topics attacking feudal institutions, and printed and distributed the minutes of the Diet in order to give publicity to the debates. For these activities, the government took him to trial for inciting unrest, operating a printing press without royal permission, and also for one of his speeches, where he called for general land-redemption. His long-lasting trials (two at the same time) became a focal point of the country's political life and reform movement. His legal representative was Ferenc K√∂lcsey. During the 1838 Pest Flood, he saved many lives by rowing about the flooded city and rescuing people from rooftops, gaining nationwide admiration. Prison Finally his trials ended and he was sentenced to 3 years in prison. After serving 2 months in the casemates of the Buda castle, he started to suffer from a serious eye ailment, and he was permitted to travel to Gr√§fenberg (now L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k) in Silesia with his family in order to cure his illness. He returned in 1843, almost completely blind and a wreck of his former self. He moved back to Zsib√≥, and served in minor positions within the local county government. Subsequently, he did much for agriculture, children's homes and the introduction and extension of the silk industry in Hungary. Last years Wessel√©nyi Monument, built 1902 in ZalƒÉu by J√°nos Fadrusz Seriously ill, he still took part in the initial stages of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and had a key role in persuading the Transylvanian Diet to proclaim union with Hungary, one of the important goals of the Revolution. Seeing the development and radicalization of the events, similar to his friend, Count Sz√©chenyi, and also many from the reform-minded aristocracy, he also became disillusioned. In September 1848 he left the country under the pretext of continuing his medical treatment in Gr√§fenberg. He stayed there, accompanied by his wife, Anna Lux, who faithfully supported and tended him through his illness. Wessel√©nyi died in 1850, while returning to Hungary from Gr√§fenberg. Among his other accomplishments, he is remembered for his support of the development of Hungarian agriculture, the introduction and extension of the silk industry, and his support for children's homes and child care. He was elected to the Board of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1830, and in 1831 he received honorary membership of the institution. From 1902, a statue of Wessel√©nyi by artist J√°nos Fadrusz has stood in the center of ZalƒÉu.

The land lies on the south facing slopes of Corstorphine Hill, from which it provides extensive views of the city. Built in 1913, and owned by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, it receives over 600,000 visitors a year, which makes it Scotland's second most popular paid-for tourist attraction, after Edinburgh Castle. As well as catering to tourists and locals, the zoo is involved in many scientific pursuits, such as captive breeding of endangered animals, researching into animal behaviour, and active participation in various conservation programs around the world. Edinburgh Zoo was the first zoo in the world to house and to breed penguins. It is also the only zoo in Britain to house Queensland koalas and giant pandas. The zoo is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), and the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions. It has also been granted four stars by the Scottish Tourism Board. The zoo gardens boast one of the most diverse tree collections in the Lothians.  History  The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) was founded as a registered charity in 1909 by an Edinburgh lawyer, Thomas Hailing Gillespie. The Corstorphine Hill site was purchased by the Society with help from the Edinburgh Town Council in early 1913. Gillespie's vision of what a zoological park should be was modelled after the 'open design' of Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, a zoo which promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, and stood in stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The design and layout were largely the product of Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law Frank Mears but Sir Robert Lorimer was involved in some of the more architectural elements including the remodelling of Corstorphine House at its centre.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer The Scottish National Zoological Park was opened to the public in 1913 and was incorporated by Royal Charter later that year. In 1948, following a visit by His Majesty King George VI, the Society was granted the privilege of adding the prefix 'Royal' to its name. It remains the only zoo with a Royal Charter in the United Kingdom. Edinburgh Zoo's long association with penguins began in January 1914, with the arrival of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today. After Tom Gillespie retired, Gilbert D. Fisher was appointed director-secretary of the zoo in 1956. He held the post till he retired in 1971.Obituary of Mr. Gilbert Fisher, The Scotsman, 15 July 1985, p.2. In 1986, the Society acquired the Highland Wildlife Park at Kingussie, south of Inverness. The zoo and the park work together in providing the most appropriate captive habitat possible in Scotland. Public visitation trips between both sites are organised frequently by the RZSS. The zoo still retains the original charter, which drives its active breeding programme, and biodiversity, conservation and sustainability initiatives. The RZSS provides multiple ways for the public to help support its mission, including a membership club, animal adoption, donations, legacies and volunteering.  Animals and exhibits =Budongo Trail= Named after the Budongo Forest in Uganda, the Budongo Trail facility houses a troop of 18 common chimpanzees; 9 males (David, Louis, Qafzeh, Paul, Rene, Frek, Kindia, Liberius and Velu) and 10 females (Cindy, Pearl, Lucy, Eva, Sophie, Lianne, Heleen, Kilimi, Edith and Masindi). The main building features viewing galleries, a lecture theatre and interactive games and displays designed to teach visitors about the chimpanzee's lifestyle and social structure. =Living Links= Living Links is built around a field station and research centre for the study of primate behaviour. The exhibit features enclosures housing common squirrel monkeys and tufted capuchins. =Penguins Rock= Two king penguins Edinburgh Zoo is well known for housing penguins in its collection, the first three being king penguins, which arrived in January 1913. The zoo's current penguin pool, named \\"Penguins Rock\\", is 65 metres long, 3.5 metres deep at its deepest point, contains 1.2 million litres of water, and houses colonies of gentoo, king, and rockhopper penguins. =Giant pandas= Tian Tian, the female giant panda, who came to the zoo with her male companion in late 2011 In 2011, Edinburgh Zoo leased two giant pandas, a male named Y√°ng GuƒÅng (ÈôΩÂÖâ, meaning \\"sunshine\\") and a female named Ti√°n Ti√°n (ÁîúÁîú, meaning \\"sweetie\\"), from the Bifengxia Breeding Centre in China at a cost of $1m a year. The zoo spent ¬£285,000 building an enclosure especially for the pandas, and they will remain at the zoo for a maximum of ten years before being returned to China. Edinburgh Zoo is currently the only zoo in the United Kingdom that houses giant pandas. =Brilliant Birds= Opened in 2011, Brilliant Birds is a walk-through aviary housing several species of exotic birds. The aviary's indoor section houses Nicobar pigeons, Bali starlings, pied imperial pigeons, chestnut-backed thrush, Victoria crowned pigeons, and a big hairy armadillo, while the outdoor section houses rainbow lorikeets. =Wee Beasties= Opened in 2017, \\"Wee Beasties\\" is an indoor exhibit displaying some the zoo's smaller species, including blue poison dart frogs, Natal Midlands dwarf chameleons, axolotl, jungle nymphs, mudskippers, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, a Chilean rose tarantula, and an aquarium tank containing tropical fish such as percula clownfish, Lamarck's angelfish and yellow tangs. =Koala Territory and Wallaby Outback= Koala Territory was first opened in 2005, and houses three koalas, two males named Gooanroo and Toorie, and a female named Alinga. Toorie is the offspring of Alinga and Goonaroo, another joey named Yooranah was born to Alinga and Goonaroo in 2013, but died in 2016. Koala Territory is decorated with Aboriginal-inspired artwork, and features a garden of eucalyptus plants. Wallaby Outback is a walk-through exhibit next to Koala Territory housing swamp wallabies, and was opened in 2015. =Animal Antics= A daily show in which keepers demonstrate the natural skills of animals to an audience of visitors. Keepers use positive reinforcement training with every animal, which means that the animals that are present at the talks are never forced. Because of this, the animals used in Animal Antics vary between shows. =Other mammals= Other notable mammal species in the zoo's collection include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, Gr√©vy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wildcats, Malayan tapirs, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red pandas, and Barbary macaques. =Other birds= A Stanley crane. Other notable bird species in the zoo's collection include Darwin's rhea, Chilean flamingos, snowy owls, Egyptian vultures, eastern white pelicans, waldrapp ibis, red-fronted macaws, hamerkop, vulturine guineafowl, and southern cassowary. =Military animals= A statue of Nils Olav Some of the zoo's animals have held military rank. * Wojtek was a bear adopted in Iran by the Polish II Corps and enlisted into the 22nd Artillery Supply Company to allow him to travel when the troops were posted. He served in the Middle East and during the Battle of Monte Cassino and retired to Edinburgh Zoo when the Polish troops, billeted in Scotland, demobilised. * Sir Nils Olav, a king penguin, was the mascot and Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian King's Guard. He was adopted in 1972 when the King's Guard were in the city for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, given the rank of visekorporal (lance corporal), and promoted each time the corps visited the city. He died in 1987 and his successor, Nils Olav II, inherited his rank. Nils was visited by the Norwegian King's Guard on 15 August 2008 and awarded a knighthood. The honour was approved by the King of Norway, King Harald V. During the ceremony a crowd of several hundred people joined the 130 guardsmen at the zoo to hear a citation from King Harald the Fifth of Norway read out, which described Nils as a penguin \\"in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood\\". Future developments In 2019, Edinburgh Zoo announced the development of a new enclosure for giraffes, and launched a Crowdfunder campaign to raise money for the project.https://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/support-us/giraffes/ The giraffe house is intended to be the first of five large scale projects the zoo is planning as part of the \\"Edinburgh Zoo's Big 5\\" initiative, these include updated enclosures for the sun bears, rhinoceros and king penguins, as well as a new tropical house with free-roaming monkeys and birds.https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/giraffes Research and conservation Edinburgh Zoo is home to a primate behavioural research centre, Living Links. Living Links consists of a field station and research centre that was developed in a partnership with the University of St Andrews. The centre houses capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys originating from the forests of South America, and offers researchers opportunities to study primate behaviour. Budongo Trail, a chimpanzee enclosure, was opened in May 2008 by The Princess Royal. Budongo Trail is a naturalistic enclosure which can house up to 40 chimps. It includes a large outdoor area and three separate indoor areas for the chimps together with observation areas and a lecture theatre for the public. The RZSS is the principal sponsor in the long term study and conservation of a group of approximately 60 chimpanzees as part of the Budongo Conservation Field Station in Uganda, Africa. Amidst the opening of Budongo Trail, Jane Goodall described it as a \\"wonderful facility\\" where primates \\"are probably better off [than] living in the wild in an area like Budongo [Forest], where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like Congo, where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially.\\"Mike Wade, Zoos are best hope, says Jane Goodall. The Times, 20 May 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2008. Gentoo penguins - adults and chicks In July 2006, a cull of invasive brown rats on the Scottish island of Canna was deemed a provisional success and after two years of observation, during which time no rats were observed, the island was declared officially rat free by the Environment Minister, Mike Russell on 7 June 2008. The rats had been outcompeting the rare local wood mouse, known as the Canna mouse and also endangering local seabird populations. The National Trust for Scotland which own the island invested ¬£500,000 employing exterminators from New Zealand to cull the estimated 10,000 brown rats. in co-operation with RZSS, approximately 150 Canna mice were captured and homed at Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park. 40 mice were returned to the island in late 2006 with the remaining being re-introduced in stages. In May 2008, a joint application submitted by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) was approved by the Scottish Government allowing for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver to the Knapdale Forest in Mid- Argyll. If the trial is successful then the European beaver will be the first mammal to be reintroduced to the United Kingdom. Beavers have been extinct in Scotland since the 16th century, when they were hunted for their pelt, meat and medicinal properties (use of castoreum). Zoo gardens Before being acquired by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‚ÄòLa Bagatelle‚Äô. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‚ÄòJohn Downie‚Äô and ‚ÄòJames Grieve‚Äô. Today, the zoo has one of the most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public. Controversies Organisations that remain critical of Edinburgh Zoo's work include the Animal Liberation Front, who have voiced their distaste for the quality of the enclosure that formerly housed polar bears. The Born Free Foundation has also stated several times that the zoo fails in its conservation work, as well as opposing the zoo's plans to house elephants. Edinburgh Zoo received a public backlash on Twitter after the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) recommended that they should cull three red river hog piglets after an unplanned birth. A protest took place under the #savethehogs tag on Thursday 3 February 2011. The Twitter campaign was started by OneKind, with major support from Captive Animals Protection Society. On Friday 4 February 2011, it was announced that the #savethehogs campaign had been successful and the zoo would attempt to re-home the piglets. The zoo also came under criticism for plans to charge ¬£20 per person for visitors to watch the necropsy of an animal. A OneKind spokesman criticised the idea, largely due to the timing of the event, which was scheduled to take place two months after the zoo announced a ¬£2 million loss in profits, making the necropsy seem like a \\"Money-making drive\\". Following various internal issues and allegations relating to senior staff, the zoo was subject to investigations relating to its charitable status. The Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) held an inquiry into the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, and one director was fired while two others were suspended. The zoo suspended its chief operating officer and acting chief executive Gary Wilson while it investigated allegations made against him. In February 2012, the zoo was told to conduct a full review of its financial controls following an inquiry into complaints about how the zoo was run in 2011. The report by the OSCR cleared the zoo of misconduct but found \\"areas of governance that could be improved\\". =Animal escapes= In July 2011, the zoo's monkey house had to be closed after a gelada escaped from its enclosure. The animal vaulted an electric fence as it tried to escape whilst visitors looked on. In May 2012, several hundred zoo visitors were forced to seek shelter after a family of red river hogs escaped from keepers and ran amok. Those who had taken refuge in the monkey house later described scenes where zoo workers pursued the animals with various equipment including brushes and dart guns. Though the drama lasted over an hour, the adult hogs were recaptured unharmed. In August 2012, a scarlet ibis escaped from the zoo and went on the loose in the city after a squirrel had chewed a hole in the netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo. In September 2012, zoo customers were escorted indoors when a Heck bull escaped from its enclosure. The 600 kg animal with three feet long horns was loose for over 40 minutes, until zoo workers and vets managed to restrain him by using tranquilliser darts.

St Anne's Chapel in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w Biography He moved to Poland after 1550, most probably from Florence, and became the court artist of king Sigismund II Augustus of Poland, his queen consort Anna Jagiellonka and his successor Stefan Batory of Poland. Santi Gucci's workshop in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w became a notable school which attracted many future artists and became one of the centres of Mannerist art and culture in Poland. For his merits for the Polish crown he was ennobled, accepted into the ranks of the szlachta and given a Zetynian Coat of Arms. One of the most successful and fruitful artists of his epoch, Gucci built or reconstructed a number of palaces of notable people in all parts of the Polish Republic. Among them was the Firlej family castle in Janowiec on the Vistula (1565‚Äì1585), for whom he also sculpted a Mannerist tomb in a local parish church (c. 1586). For the Piotr Myszkowski family he erected a new palace in KsiƒÖ≈º Wielki (1585‚Äì1595), Mir√≥w Castle. He also erected the ≈Åobz√≥w palace (1585‚Äì1587), in Krak√≥w, and expanded the castle in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w (1591‚Äì1600). He is also supposed to be the architect of the Pi≈Ñcz√≥w synagogue. One of his most notable works is the integral design and funerary monuments in the Bartolommeo Berrecci's Sigismund's Chapel in the Wawel Cathedral. The chapel, often referred to as the pearl of Italian Renaissance north of the Alps, housed the graves of King Sigismund Augustus of Poland and Anna Jagiellonka. Between 1594 and 1595 he also refurbished the Mariacka Chapel to house the tomb of Stefan Batory. Others among his major works include the Branicki family chapel in Niepo≈Çomice (1596) and St. Anne's Chapel in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w.

Generally, they operate from early June to early August. Players use wooden baseball bats, hence the common nickname of these leagues as \\"wood bat leagues\\". To find a collegiate summer team, players work with their college coaches and prospective teams' general managers. They report to summer leagues after completing their spring collegiate season with their NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and NWAC teams. Some players arrive late due to their college team's postseason play, which sometimes runs into early June. In some cases, players are drafted during the collegiate summer season. These draftees can remain with their collegiate summer team until they sign a professional contract. During the season, players are housed by volunteer host families and bussed to and from road games. The leagues vary greatly in their attendances, quality of play, and ability to attract scouts.

Through iconography and visual narratives that celebrate ‚Äúthe beauty of the bittersweetness of life,‚Äù his work brings together the worlds of popular culture and fine art. Baseman‚Äôs career includes illustration for clients including The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and The Wall Street Journal and the bestselling board game Cranium; as well as animation for the Emmy and BAFTA award-winning series and feature film ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äôs Pet‚Äù for ABC/Disney. He is a frequent speaker at international conferences on graphic and multidisciplinary arts and visual communications. Recent projects include a collaboration with COACH; a documentary ‚ÄúMythical Creatures‚Äù about his family heritage; a traveling retrospective that featured hundreds of his paintings, photographs, videos, and toy and costume designs.  Early Life and Education  Gary Baseman was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He was the first American-born child of four to Ben and Naomi Baseman, both Holocaust survivors originally from Eastern Poland (now Ukraine). His parents believed strongly in the American Dream, and instilled in their son democratic ideals, using their right to vote, unionize, and advocate for issues that resonated with them. Having experienced horrific history, they encouraged their son to show empathy and compassion for others, as well as be true to oneself. The influence of media and Hollywood, blended with LA‚Äôs influential art scene, led to how Baseman would perceive and produce art. > ‚ÄúI grew up in the center of the city, the son of immigrants, attending > public school with kids with different backgrounds. Our house was blocks > away from CBS Television City. My mom worked at Canter‚Äôs in the Fairfax > District, where people from the industry and rock-n-rollers would often > land. I was a latchkey kid whose parents were often working, and whose older > siblings were out on their own. Television was like my babysitter. Early > on, my brother brought animation cels from Hanna-Barbera Studios home for me > to play with. While sitting and drawing at the coffee table in the living > room, I‚Äôd watch hours of cartoons and comedies and dramas.‚Äù Baseman graduated magna cum laude from UCLA in communications, inspired by the First Amendment (which protects free speech, religion, press, assembly, right to petition), and developed into an effective visual problem-solver and message-maker.  Pervasive art  While Baseman is a figure in the Los Angeles art world, he is also situated within an international cultural movement that includes both mainstream and underground artists. Baseman cites Yoshitomo Nara, Takashi Murakami, and the illustrator William Joyce as contemporaries. Baseman coined the term pervasive art as an alternative to the lowbrow art label. Baseman uses the term didactically to describe a broad shift in his and others' work to more visible avenues of art-making. He has stated that his goal is to \\"blur the lines between fine art and commercial art.\\" According to Baseman, pervasive art can take any medium, and need not be \\"limited to one world, whether that is the gallery world, editorial world, or art toy world.\\" Today, artists whom Baseman might refer to as pervasive are part of a larger movement with a recognizable \\"pop\\" sense, but not necessarily a shared artistic mission. However, by virtue of where these artists are shown and in what ways they garner public attention, it can be said that all pervasive artists in some way play with the boundaries between high and low art. Among artistic peers, critics, and Baseman followers, pervasive art referred to an aesthetic that was until recently, limited to the mediums of album art, comic books, cartoons, graffiti, and speciality galleries. Now, pervasive art is largely realized in multiple mediums and across a range of industries, from fashion design, advertising and graphic design, to toy design, film, music collaboratives, and music videos. Cult- status street artists like Banksy, new wave comics illustrators like Gary Panter, Japanese pop artists, post-punk and hip hop artists, and graphic artists like Shepard Fairey all contribute to a highly visible aesthetic that is virtually ubiquitous in contemporary culture. Baseman himself exemplifies pervasive art in that he works commercially and also remains an independent fine artist. While he creates products that are sold to a mass market, he also shows in museums and galleries, selling original artworks to collectors. Baseman employs traditional art practices such as painting, printmaking, sculpture, drawing, and collage. For Baseman, being a pervasive artist means staying true to a particular message and aesthetic no matter the medium employed.  Career = Illustration = As Tom Teicholz pointed out in his 2013 interview \\"Going Home with Gary Baseman\\", ‚ÄúAfter graduating from UCLA, Baseman pursued a commercial art career while continuing to make art, ‚Äúon the side.‚Äù He did a short stint at an ad agency, but that did not really agree with him, so he began to pursue work as a commercial illustrator. To make his American Dream come true and despite his parents‚Äô initial objections, Baseman moved to New York in 1986.‚Äù > ‚ÄúThe advertising and publishing and art world were all in New York. Every > major artist was in New York, and at the time if you lived in L.A. you were > a substandard regional artist. You had to go there‚Äù, Gary Baseman has said. From 1986-1996, Baseman worked as an illustrator in New York. He established himself during this period as an in-demand artist with a unique visual sense and the ability to generate sharp, witty messages. He earned several awards from American Illustration, Art Directors Club, and Communication Arts. Baseman refers to his illustration work, and to his general process, as message-making. Baseman's drawings have been published in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Time, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times. He has had major independent and corporate clients such as AT&T; Corporation, Gatorade, Nike, Inc., and Mercedes-Benz. Baseman created the visual identity for the best-selling board game Cranium. After ten years in New York, Baseman returned to Los Angeles to explore opportunities in art and entertainment. = Fine art = By the end of the 1990s, Baseman realized his creativity could extend beyond the world of illustration. His desire to learn and explore other areas of art would result in an explosive creative period for him that blurred lines and expanded audiences as he explained: > ‚ÄúI had a hunger for many things. I started looking at my legacy and thinking > ‚Äòwhat am I leaving behind me‚Äô? I loved the editorial work, but it didn‚Äôt > seem rich enough. I had a fear of creating my own body of work and bringing > it out into the world. It always stems from a fear of failure or that people > won‚Äôt be interested. But I didn‚Äôt let that stop me. While doing my editorial > work, even if I had an assignment, I couldn‚Äôt stop experimenting with my own > things and painting like crazy, but still always made sure to hit my > professional deadlines. At the same time, I also wanted to do TV; I created > two pilots for Nickelodeon that never got created in the end. I was > expanding in different ways, getting bigger within the toy world and > participating in exhibitions. At the time, I was gradually giving up the > editorial work, so it was an easier transition.‚Äù In 1999, Baseman exhibited \\"Dumb Luck and Other Paintings About Lack of Control\\" at the Mendenhall Gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibition established Baseman's transition from illustration to fine art, during a time when many of his artist-friends, like Mark Ryden, the Clayton Brothers, and Eric White made similar moves. Since then, Baseman has exhibited in museums and galleries throughout the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Baseman's work is featured in the permanent collections of the Laguna Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. and the Museum of Modern Art in Rome. Baseman had his first major art museum retrospective, \\"Gary Baseman: The Door is Always Open\\", in 2013 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, California. The exhibition presented more than 300 artworks (including paintings, photographs, toys, sketchbooks, and videos) in an experiential home environment in which guests were invited to sit on a sofa or at the dining room table and explore, participate and visit. The Door is Always Open has since traveled to MOCA Taipei, Taiwan (Summer 2014) and to Shanghai chi K11 Art Museum (Winter 2015). = Toby = Toby is one of Baseman's most recognizable characters, an adventurous cat that loves unconditionally. Named after one of Baseman's childhood friends, Toby is your best friend and keeper of your secrets. In 2005, Toby first appeared in drawings, paintings, and plush toys in the exhibition For the Love of Toby at Billy Shire Fine Arts in Culver City, California, marking the official beginning of Toby as a bridge between character development, toy culture, and fine art. Debuted at a crucial moment when popular culture and lifestyle strongly influenced art, Toby represents an important aspect of 21st century art: art everywhere, in multiple media and platforms. In Summer 2015, Baseman commemorated Toby's 10th year as a formal artwork, blurring the lines of fine art and toy culture. HAPPY TOBY TO YOU! at Hong Kong Times Square showcased works from the first Toby art exhibition, photographs, and videos of Toby's adventurous world travels, and a birthday party sculptural installation of Toby and other Baseman characters. The exhibition was housed in another experiential environment conceptualized by Baseman and co-designed by Hjalti Karlsson of New York-based design firm karlssonwilker. = Fashion and toys = Baseman has translated many of his characters into toys and figurines, clothing, handbags, and other accessories. Prominent characters include Toby, Hotchachacha, \\"the little devil who steals haloes,\\" and ChouChou who \\"dispels hate and fear, and oozes Creamy Gooey Love out of his belly button.\\" For toy, figurine, and limited edition projects, Baseman has collaborated with Critterbox, Toy2R, Kidrobot, Pretty in Plastic, The Loyal Subjects, and 3DRetro. Fashion collaborations include Swatch, Hobbs & Kent, Harvey's, Poketo, and Frau Blau. In 2015, Baseman collaborated with Coach's Creative Director, Stuart Vevers, for the Baseman x COACH 2015 Spring Collection. The collection introduced an original series of Baseman characters (Buster Le Fauve, Emmanuel Hare Ray, Kiki, Buddy Boy, Butch), capturing the attitude of New York City and developed with the Coach girl in mind. In Summer 2015, Coach released the Baseman x Coach Wild Beast collection, featuring handbags, apparel, and accessories with Baseman's reimagined animal print. = Television = In 1998, Baseman created the Disney animated series Teacher's Pet, about a dog who dresses as a boy because he wants to go to school. Baseman claims the character Spot was based on his dog at the time, Hubcaps. The series aired on ABC from 2000‚Äì2002, and the feature film of the same name came out in 2004.Saltz, Ina. \\"Smearing the Boundaries.\\" HOW Design. June 2008: 80. The cartoon included the voice talents of Nathan Lane, Debra Jo Rupp, Jerry Stiller, David Ogden Stiers, Mae Whitman, and Wallace Shawn. The film featured Kelsey Grammer, Paul Reubens, and Estelle Harris.IMDb. Accessed December 15, 2010. Baseman won the Outstanding Individual in Animation Emmy for Production Design in 2003. The show also won 2 Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program 2001 and 2002; Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program: Nathan Lane in 2001; and a BAFTA Emmy for Best International Children's Program in 2001. Baseman also worked on an animated short for the Nickelodeon television series, KaBlam! The short was called The Louie & Louie Show, following the adventure of a hamster and a chameleon both named Louie. Baseman animated the sketch, and was directed by Tom McGrath. The short only aired once. = Performance = Baseman added performance art to his oeuvre in 2009 with \\"La Noche de la Fusion,\\" a mythical holiday festival celebrating the bittersweetness of existence by fusing cultures and blurring the lines of reality. Shown in 2009 at the Corey Helford Gallery in Culver City, the event featured games, live music, dancers, and live models of Baseman's characters such as Toby, ChouChou, Hotchachacha, Skeleton Girl, Hickey Bat Girl, Bubble Girl, and Butterfly Girl. In June 2010, Baseman presented \\"Giggle and Pop!\\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Live action costumed ChouChous played in the La Brea Tar Pits along with performers dressed as Baseman's WildGirls, who were renamed \\"Tar Pit Girls\\" for the occasion. The characters performed a dance choreographed by Sarah Elgart and the audience joined in with singer- songwriter Carina Round, who performed a song she composed for the event. In July 2013, Toby's Secret Society came alive in \\"Secrets and Truths,\\" a spectacular art performance created by Gary Baseman with choreography by Sarah Elgart, costumes by Swinda Reichelt, and music by LA- and Iceland-based Cassette Recordings Collective ‚Äì arrangement by Scott Hackwith. Created in conjunction with Baseman's The Door is Always Open exhibition at the Skirball Cultural Center, the performance featured Veritas, the Goddess of Dreams, the Princess of Secrets, the Sacred Magi, and the WildGirls performing a special ritual that unveiled \\"Secrets and Truth.\\" In February 2015, Baseman created \\"The Secret Order of the Camellias,\\" a site-specific installation and performative space at the Serpentine Gallery in London that commemorated the Baseman x Coach 2015 Spring collection. Showcasing the wild beast characters that protect secrets and represent loyalty and friendship, guests participated in a special rite of passage into the Secret Order by offering their deepest darkest dreams at the Shrine of Buster Le Fauve. Inspiring wonder and passion for life, Gary Baseman initiated an adventurous few who faced their fears and desires. = Film = Baseman and director David Charles launched a Kickstarter campaign in July 2014 to fund one of Baseman's personally meaningful creative projects, a film documentary called \\"Mythical Creatures\\". The film began in 2012 when Baseman first traveled to Eastern Europe on a Fulbright Fellowship, detouring to his parents' hometowns which had not been visited by any family member in over 60 years. Mythical Creatures aims to connect the stories of the Holocaust to an entirely new generation through Baseman's parents' dark experiences during World War II. The film combines live action documentary elements, along with extensive animated sequences, and other storytelling techniques. Baseman says, \\"It's really about taking all of the different narratives from the myths I've been told and mixing them with my characters to try and find my truth,\\" he says. \\"We're not doing it in a straightforward historical way. It's really an exploration of my psyche.\\" Mythical Creatures has the support of the Sundance Institute's New Frontier Story Lab and the Museum of the Holocaust in Los Angeles.

The most well-known material with NTE is water at 0~4 ¬∞C. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential engineering, photonic, electronic, and structural applications. For example, if one were to mix a negative thermal expansion material with a \\"normal\\" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to use it as a thermal expansion compensator what might allow for forming composites with tailored or even close to zero thermal expansion.  Origin of negative thermal expansion  There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, Rigid Unit Modes and phase transitions. Recently, Liu et al. showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in ). Alternatively, large negative and positive thermal expansion may result from the design of internal microstructure.  Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems  Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. ice, graphene, etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. , , beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper, it was shown that negative thermal expansion (NTE) is also realized in single-component close-packed lattices with pair central force interactions. The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed for the interatomic potential, \\\\Pi(x), at the equilibrium distance a : \\\\Pi(a) > 0, Where \\\\Pi(a) is shorthand for the third derivative of the interatomic potential at the equilibrium point: \\\\Pi(a) = \\\\left.\\\\frac{d^3 \\\\Pi(x)}{dx^3}\\\\right_{x=a} This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. An approximate necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper \\\\Pi'(a)a > -(d-1)\\\\Pi(a), where d is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is caused by anharmonicity of interatomic potential only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both \\\\Pi and \\\\Pi' are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.  Materials  Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit negative thermal expansion is zirconium tungstate (). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes). Other materials that exhibit NTE behaviour include other members of the family of materials (where A = or , M = or ) and and , though and only in their high temperature phase starting at 350 to 400 K. also is an example of controllable negative thermal expansion. Cubic materials like and also and are especially precious for applications in engineering because they exhibit isotropic NTE i.e. the NTE is the same in all three dimensions making it easier to apply them as thermal expansion compensators. Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below ‚Äì200 ¬∞C). In its liquid form, pure water also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984 ¬∞C. ALLVAR, a titanium-based alloy, shows NTE over a wide temperature range, with a -30 ppm/¬∞C instantaneous coefficient of thermal expansion at 20 ¬∞C. Rubber elasticity shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material. Carbon fibers shows NTE between 20¬∞C and 500¬∞C. This property is utilized in tight-tolerance aerospace applications to tailor the CTE of carbon fiber reinforced plastic components for specific applications/conditions, by adjusting the ratio of carbon fiber to plastic and by adjusting the orientation of the carbon fibers within the part. Quartz () and a number of zeolites also show NTE over certain temperature ranges. Fairly pure silicon (Si) has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 K and 120 K. Cubic Scandium trifluoride has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts. exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion. Shape memory alloys such as NiTi are a nascent class of materials that exhibit zero and negative thermal expansion.  Applications  Forming a composite of a material with (ordinary) positive thermal expansion with a material with (anomalous) negative thermal expansion could allow for tailoring the thermal expansion of the composites or even having composites with a thermal expansion close to zero. Negative and positive thermal expansion hereby compensate each other to a certain amount if the temperature is changed. Tailoring the overall thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) to a certain value can be achieved by varying the volume fractions of the different materials contributing to the thermal expansion of the composite. Especially in engineering there is a need for having materials with a CTE close to zero i.e. with constant performance over a large temperature range e.g. for application in precision instruments. But also in everyday life materials with a CTE close to zero are required. Glass-ceramic cooktops like Ceran cooktops need to withstand large temperature gradients and rapid changes in temperature while cooking because only certain parts of the cooktops will be heated while other parts stay close to ambient temperature. In general, due to its brittleness temperature gradients in glass might cause cracks. However, the glass-ceramics used in cooktops consist of multiple different phases, some exhibiting positive and some others exhibiting negative thermal expansion. The expansion of the different phases compensate each other so that there is not much change in volume of the glass-ceramic with temperature and crack formation is avoided. An everyday life example for the need for materials with tailored thermal expansion are dental fillings. If the fillings tend to expand by an amount different from the teeth, for example when drinking a hot or cold drink, it might cause a toothache. If dental fillings are, however, made of a composite material containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of tooth enamel.

They were: *The inhabitants of conquered towns which had been deprived of local self-government, who possessed the jus conubii (right of legal marriage) and jus commercii (right to engage in lawful business), but no political rights. Caere is said to have been the first example of this (353 BC). Hence the expression \\"in tabulas Caeritum referre\\" came to mean \\" to degrade to the status of an aerarius.\\" *Full citizens subjected to civil degradation (infamia) as the result of following certain professions (primarily the performing arts), of dishonourable acts in private life (for instance stuprum) or of conviction for certain crimes. *Persons \\"branded\\" (stigmatized by receiving a nota, essentially a \\"black mark\\") by the censor. Those who were thus excluded from the tribes and centuries had no vote, were incapable of filling Roman magistracies and could not serve in the army. According to Theodore Mommsen, the aerarii were originally the non-assidui (non-holders of land), excluded from the tribes, the comitia and the army. By a reform of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus in 312 BC these non-assidui were admitted into the tribes, and the aerarii as such disappeared. But in 304, Fabius Rullianus limited them to the four city tribes, and from that time the term meant a man degraded from a higher (rural) to a lower (urban) tribe, but not deprived of the right of voting or of serving in the army. The expressions tribu movere and aerarium facere, regarded by Mommsen as identical in meaning (\\"to degrade from a higher tribe to a lower\\"), are explained by Greenidge the first as relegation from a higher to a lower tribe or total exclusion from the tribes, the second as exclusion from the centuries. Other views of the original aerarii are that they were: artisans and freedmen (Niebuhr); inhabitants of towns united with Rome by a hospitium publicum, who had become domiciled on Roman territory (Lange); only a class of degraded citizens, including neither the cives sine suffragio nor the artisans (according to Johan Nicolai Madvig); identical with the capite censi of the Servian constitution (Belot, Greenidge).

The clashes started in Linz and took place principally in the cities of Vienna, Graz, Bruck an der Mur, Judenburg, Wiener Neustadt and Steyr, but also in some other industrial cities of eastern and central Austria.Frederick L. Schuman, Europe On The Eve 1933-1939 (1939) pp 55-92 online.  Origins of the conflict  The Schlingerhof in Floridsdorf, where a large cache of weapons was based, and in 1934 used by the Republikanischer Schutzbund After the end of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in 1918, the state of Austria was created as a parliamentary democracy. Two major factions dominated politics in the new nation: socialists (represented politically by the Social Democratic Workers' Party) and conservatives (politically represented by the Christian Social Party). The socialists found their strongholds in the working class districts of the cities, while the conservatives could build on the support of the rural population and of most of the upper classes. The conservatives also maintained close alliances with the Catholic Church, and could count among their ranks some leading clerics. As in most of the nascent European democracies of the time, politics in Austria took on a highly ideological flavour. Both the socialist and the conservative camp did not merely consist of political parties, but possessed far-ranging power structures, including their own paramilitary forces. The conservatives began organising the Heimwehr () in 1921‚Äì23; in response, the Social Democrats organised paramilitaries called the Republikanischer Schutzbund () after 1923. Altercations and clashes between these forces (at political rallies, etc.) occurred frequently. A first major incident ensued early in 1927, when members of Hermann Hiltl's Frontk√§mpfervereinigung (\\"Front Fighters Union\\" ‚Äî a paramilitary association likewise affiliated with the conservative camp) shot and killed an eight-year- old boy and a war veteran marching with the Schutzbund in a peaceful counter- demonstration in Schattendorf (Burgenland). In July, three defendants in the case were acquitted, which led to outrage in the left-wing camp. On 15 July 1927, a general strike occurred, and demonstrations took place in the capital. After the storming of a police station, security forces started shooting at demonstrators. An angry group of people then set fire to the Palace of Justice (Justizpalast), seen as a symbol of a flawed and partial judicial system. Altogether, 89 people (85 of them demonstrators) lost their lives in this July revolt, and many hundreds suffered injury. Surprisingly, the violence soon died down and the factions took their battle from the streets back into the political institutions. However, the travails of the First Republic only got worse in the following years. The Great Depression also showed its effects in Austria, resulting in high unemployment and massive inflation. In addition, from 1933 ‚Äî the year Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany ‚Äî National Socialist sympathisers (who wanted a unification of Austria with Hitler's Germany) threatened the Austrian state from within.  Conflict  On 4 March 1933, Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfu√ü suspended the Austrian Parliament. In a close vote (on railway workers' wages) in the National Council, each of the three presidents of parliament resigned their position in order to cast a ballot, leaving nobody to preside over the meeting. Even though the bylaws could have resolved this situation, Dollfuss used this opportunity to declare that parliament had ceased to function, and blocked all attempts to reconvene it, also threatening to use military force against the parliamentarians, should they try to reconvene. The Social Democratic Party had thus lost its major platform for political action. The conservatives, facing pressure and violence not only from the left but also from Nazis infiltrating from Germany, could now rule by decree on the basis of a 1917 emergency law, without checks on their power, and began to suspend civil liberties. They banned the Schutzbund and imprisoned many of its members. February fights: Federal Army soldiers take position in front of the Vienna State Opera On 12 February 1934, a force, led by Heimwehr commander in Vienna Emil Fey, searched Hotel Schiff in Linz, a property belonging to the Social Democratic Party. Linz Schutzbund commander Richard Bernaschek was the first to actively resist, sparking off armed conflict between a conglomeration of the Heimwehr, the police, the gendarmerie and the regular Federal Army against the outlawed, but still existent, socialist Schutzbund.Brook-Shepherd 280‚Äì81. Skirmishes between the two camps spread to other cities and towns in Austria, with the heat of the action occurring in Vienna. There, members of the Schutzbund barricaded themselves in city council housing estates (Gemeindebauten), the symbols and strongholds for the socialist movement in Austria, such as Karl-Marx-Hof. Police and paramilitaries took up positions outside these fortified complexes and the parties exchanged fire, initially only with small arms. Fighting also occurred in industrial towns such as Steyr, Sankt P√∂lten, Weiz, Eggenberg (Graz), Kapfenberg, Bruck an der Mur, Graz, Ebensee and W√∂rgl. An apparently decisive moment in the events came with the entry of the Austrian armed forces into the conflict. Though the army remained still a comparatively independent institution, chancellor Dollfuss ordered Karl-Marx-Hof shelled with light artillery, endangering the lives of thousands of civilians and destroying many flats before forcing the socialist fighters to surrender.Reppe 79. The fighting ended in Vienna and Upper Austria by 13 February, but continued heavily in Styrian cities, especially in Bruck an der Mur and Judenburg, until 14 or 15 February. After that, there were only small groups of socialists fighting against the armed forces, or fleeing from them. By 16 February 1934, the Austrian Civil War had ended.  Fallout  Memorial stone for a police officer killed on 12 February 1934 in Linz during the warSeveral hundred people (including paramilitaries, members of the security forces and civilians) died in the armed conflict; more than a thousand suffered wounds. The authorities tried and executed nine Schutzbund leaders under the provisions of martial law. In addition, over 1,500 arrests were made. Leading socialist politicians, such as Otto Bauer, were forced into exile.Brook-Shepherd 283. John Gunther reported that Schutzbund members received \\"mercilessly severe\\" sentences. The incidents of February 1934 were taken as a pretext by the government to prohibit the Social Democratic Party and its affiliated trade unions altogether. In May, the conservatives replaced the democratic constitution by a corporatist constitution modelled along the lines of Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy; therefore the socialists coined the term 'Austrofascism' although the underlying ideology was essentially that of the most conservative elements in the Austrian Catholic clergy, a feature inconsistent with both Italian Fascism and Nazism. The Patriotic Front (Vaterl√§ndische Front), into which the Heimwehr and the Christian Social Party were merged, became the only legal political party in the resulting authoritarian regime, the St√§ndestaat.  Long-term effects  Memorial to the victims and fighters at the place where the civil war started, in the courtyard of the Hotel Schiff in Linz. Though small in scale in an international comparison (and small in scale indeed in the light of the events of the Second World War which soon followed), the Austrian Civil War nevertheless proved a decisive moment in the history of the Republic. After the Second World War, when Austria re-emerged on the political landscape as a sovereign nation, politics again fell under the domination of the Social Democrats and the conservatives, who now formed a party called the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP). However, so as to avoid a repeat of the bitter divisions of the First Republic, the leaders of the Second Republic were determined to put the idea of broad consensus at the heart of the new political system. The concept of the 'Grand Coalition' was introduced, in which the two major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) shared in the government and avoided open confrontation. This system brought with it stability and continuity, but ultimately led to other political repercussions (also see Proporz). But the events of the Austrian Civil War had persuaded many in the political establishment (and, indeed, the population at large) that a slow pace of political reform was a small price to pay for social stability.

Another signature feature of the series is its Edit mode, a character creation feature with many options to customize appearances, wrestling moves and character A.I. behavior. Unlike many other pro wrestling games, most Fire Pro games are not licensed by any major professional wrestling promotion, but feature likenesses of real-life wrestlers under different names. Games in the series generally utilize 2-D sprite-based graphics, with some later games incorporating 3D graphical elements. The spin-off King of Colosseum series features polygonal 3D graphics. Most of the titles in the Fire Pro Wrestling series have been released in Japan, although some of the games have seen releases in North America. Series features Unlike many other pro wrestling games, most games in the Fire Pro Wrestling series are not licensed by any major professional wrestling promotion, but feature likenesses of real-life wrestlers under different names. Games in the series generally utilize 2-D sprite-based graphics, with some later games incorporating 3-D graphical elements. The spin-off series King of Colosseum features polygonal 3-D graphics. The Fire Pro Wrestling series of games distinguish themselves from other wrestling games by combining several unique features. One feature is the focus on a timing-based grappling control system. The grappling control system encourages the use of complex strategy, built on working up to using increasingly powerful moves on your opponent. The timing-based system also stands in contrast to the button-mashing tactics with which most 2-D wrestling gamers are familiar. Another feature of Fire Pro Wrestling games is the inclusion of a large roster of playable wrestlers and fighters from different promotions located around the world. The wrestlers and promotions are renamed from their real-life counterparts to avoid copyright, and represent many different styles of professional wrestling: North American WWE style sports-entertainment, Mexican lucha-libre, various styles of Japanese puroresu: athletic junior- heavyweight style, realistic strong-style, women's joshi wrestling, and violent hardcore wrestling, as well as different styles of mixed martial arts. A variety of match types are available in the Fire Pro Wrestling series of games, with flexible settings for the rules within each match. This complements the variety of wrestlers available as playable characters. Different match types include conventional singles and tag-team wrestling matches, extreme hardcore matches such as the \\"Landmine Death Match\\" or \\"Electric Barbed Wire Cage Match\\", and various types of mixed-martial-arts matches. Another distinguishing feature of the Fire Pro Wrestling series of games, particularly the later games in the series, is the inclusion of an extensive and highly detailed wrestler creation and edit mode. The edit mode of Fire Pro Wrestling games allows players to build game characters with a high level of attention to detail. Appearance characteristics, such as clothing and ring attire, and physical build, head and facial features, can be customized for a created wrestler. A detailed set of wrestling and fighting moves, drawn from the large pool of moves built into each game, can also be assigned to a created wrestler. The edit mode of Fire Pro Wrestling games also allows players to make detailed changes to the CPU logic of an edited wrestler, making it possible for a skilled creator to create a wrestler that behaves very much like his real-life counterpart, even when controlled by the computer. Later titles in the series allowed for customization of other aspects of professional wrestling, including changing the design of the ring mat, creating customized championship belts, and creation and editing of referees. The detailed character creation and edit mode of the Fire Pro Wrestling games became an influential feature that was eventually added to other wrestling and sports games. The combination of features included in Fire Pro Wrestling games allows players to create \\"dream matchups\\" between wrestlers from different promotions, or different eras in the history of professional wrestling, as well as matches between real-life wrestlers and fighters, fictional characters and non-wrestling celebrities. Overview Beginning with the first title in the series from Human Entertainment, Fire Pro Wrestling Combination Tag for PC Engine in 1989, the Fire Pro Wrestling series eventually produced editions of games for many systems, notably the Super Famicom, Sega Saturn, Game Boy Advance, Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2. Human also released a wrestling game outside the Fire Pro Wrestling series in 1989 for Game Boy. Titled Pro Wrestling in its native Japan, it was released internationally as HAL Wrestling. Most of the titles in the Fire Pro Wrestling series have been released exclusively in Japan, although some of the games have seen releases in North America. The series became popular in Japan, but did not see an international release until after Spike took over the franchise in 2000. Early games in the Fire Pro Wrestling series were popular outside Japan with import gamers, and at least one game, Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium for Super Famicom, received an unofficial fan translation through video game console emulators. Fire Pro Wrestling A for the Game Boy Advance was released internationally as Fire Pro Wrestling in 2001, and was one of the titles initially available when the Game Boy Advance was launched in Japan and North America. Four editions of the game have received official English translations: Fire Pro Wrestling (2001) and Fire Pro Wrestling 2 (2002) for the GBA, Fire Pro Wrestling Returns for PS2 (2007), and Fire Pro Wrestling World for the Steam PC platform and PS4 (2017/2018) . At the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, it was announced that a 3-D avatar-based version of Fire Pro Wrestling would be released for the Xbox 360 in 2011. It was not released until September 21, 2012. In hopes of appealing to a more casual audience, the developers decided on debuting a new gameplay engine that would use a button- mashing minigame system to perform moves, and not using the well-reviewed timing elements from previous versions of the game. On February 24, 2017, Spike Chunsoft debuted a website featuring a teaser video of the series making a possible return. Less than a week later, on March 3, Fire Pro Wrestling World would be officially announced, returning the series to its roots, in terms of graphical presentation and gameplay mechanics. Also, the new game would be the first in the series to incorporate online multiplayer gameplay on the PC via Steam and the PlayStation 4 console. Fire Pro Wrestling World was released to Early Access on Steam for the PC platform on July 10, 2017, and left Early Access, to a full release, on December 18, 2017.

Illustration by Christian Krohg. Vagn √Ökesson was a Norseman of the late 10th century, mentioned in the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga. At the age of 12, Vagn, a precocious warrior, applied for admission to the mercenary brotherhood of the Jomsvikings. According to the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga, Vagn was the son of Aki, a son of the Jomsviking chieftain Palnatoke. Intrigued by the courage displayed by Vagn, his grandfather Palnatoke allowed him (after first attempting to dissuade him) to prove his worth with a duel against Sigvaldi Strut- Haraldsson, whom Vagn defeated. He was admitted to the order despite the Jomsviking rule that no man under the age of 18 be allowed to join. Palnatoke adopted Vagn, who is described as one of the most fearless of the Jomsvikings, as a sort of prot√©g√©. Vagn's courage stand in sharp contrast to the pragmatism (some would say cowardice) displayed by Sigvaldi. After Palnatoke's death, Sigvaldi became leader of the order. At the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr, he ordered a retreat, an order which Vagn angrily refused to obey. According to the saga, Vagn even threw his spear in Sigvaldi's direction, but missed. Vagn managed to survive the battle with honor and was spared by Eir√≠kr H√°konarson, while Sigvaldi became the object of ridicule. References *Hollander, Lee M., Trans. The Saga of the Jomsvikings.

The magic angle is a root of a second-order Legendre polynomial, , and so any interaction which depends on this second-order Legendre polynomial vanishes at the magic angle. This property makes the magic angle of particular importance in magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In magnetic resonance imaging, structures with ordered collagen, such as tendons and ligaments, oriented at the magic angle may appear hyperintense in some sequences; this is called the magic angle artifact or effect. Mathematical definition Magic angle The magic angle Œ∏m is : \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{m} = \\\\arccos \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\arctan \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\approx 0.955\\\\,32\\\\ \\\\text{rad} \\\\approx 54.7^\\\\circ \\\\\\\\! , where arccos and arctan are the inverse cosine and tangent functions respectively. Œ∏m is the angle between the space diagonal of a cube and any of its three connecting edges, see image. Another representation of the magic angle is half of the opening angle formed when a cube is rotated from its space diagonal axis, which may be represented as arccos ‚àí or 2 arctan radians ‚âà 109.4712¬∞. This double magic angle is directly related to tetrahedral molecular geometry and is the angle between two vertices and the exact center of a tetrahedron (i.e., the edge central angle also known as the tetrahedral angle). Magic angle and nuclear magnetic resonance Magic angle effect seen on MRI of the shoulder In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, three prominent nuclear magnetic interactions, dipolar coupling, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA), and first-order quadrupolar coupling, depend on the orientation of the interaction tensor with the external magnetic field. By spinning the sample around a given axis, their average angular dependence becomes: :\\\\left\\\\langle 3\\\\cos^2\\\\theta -1 \\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( 3\\\\cos^2\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{r} -1 \\\\right)\\\\left( 3\\\\cos^2\\\\beta -1 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\! , where Œ∏ is the angle between the principal axis of the interaction and the magnetic field, Œ∏r is the angle of the axis of rotation relative to the magnetic field and Œ≤ is the (arbitrary) angle between the axis of rotation and principal axis of the interaction. For dipolar couplings, the principal axis corresponds to the internuclear vector between the coupled spins; for the CSA, it corresponds to the direction with the largest deshielding; for the quadrupolar coupling, it corresponds to the z-axis of the electric-field gradient tensor. The angle Œ≤ cannot be manipulated as it depends on the orientation of the interaction relative to the molecular frame and on the orientation of the molecule relative to the external field. The angle Œ∏r, however, can be decided by the experimenter. If one sets Œ∏r = Œ∏m ‚âà 54.7¬∞, then the average angular dependence goes to zero. Magic angle spinning is a technique in solid-state NMR spectroscopy which employs this principle to remove or reduce the influence of anisotropic interactions, thereby increasing spectral resolution. For a time-independent interaction, i.e. heteronuclear dipolar couplings, CSA and first-order quadrupolar couplings, the anisotropic component is greatly reduced and almost suppressed in the limit of fast spinning, i.e. when the spinning frequency is greater than the width of the interaction. The averaging is only close to zero in a first-order perturbation theory treatment; higher order terms cause allowed frequencies at multiples of the spinning frequency to appear, creating spinning side-bands in the spectra. Time-dependent interactions, such as homonuclear dipolar couplings, are more difficult to average to their isotropic values by magic angle spinning; a network of strongly coupled spins will produce a mixing of spin states during the course of the sample rotation, interfering with the averaging process. Application to medical imaging: The magic angle artifact The magic angle artifact refers to the increased signal observed when MRI sequences with short echo time (TE) (e.g., T1 or proton density spin-echo sequences) are used to image tissues with well-ordered collagen fibers in one direction (e.g., tendon or articular hyaline cartilage). This artifact occurs when the angle such fibers make with the magnetic field is equal to Œ∏m. Example: This artifact comes into play when evaluating the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder. The magic angle effect can create the appearance of supraspinatus tendinitis. Reinforced rubber To achieve optimal loading in a straight rubber hose the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54.7 angular degrees, also referred to as the magic angle. The magic angle of 54.7 exactly balances the internal-pressure-induced longitudinal stress and the hoop (circumferential) stress.

It was located in the hilly western Himalaya promontory bordering Tibet in the northern part of colonial Punjab region. The territory of this former state is now part of Kinnaur and Shimla districts of the present Himachal Pradesh state. The erstwhile Bushahr state was traversed by the Sutlej river. It was bordered on the west by the Kulu, Lahaul and Spiti states and by Tehri Garhwal on the east. It had an area of 8,907 km¬≤. History Map of the Bashahr state, 1911 Bashahr and Tehri Garhwal shown in yellow in an 1863 map of Eastern Punjab The erstwhile Bushahr state was occupied by a Gorkha king from central Nepal from 1803 to 1815. Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Sikh state in the Punjab, intervened in 1809 and drove the Nepalese army east of the Satluj river. A rivalry between Nepal and the British East India Company over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1815‚Äì16) or the Gurkha War. Both parties eventually signed the Treaty of Sugauli, following which the Gurkhas were expelled from Kamru, the capital of Bushahr. In 1898, Bushahr state was taken over by the British administration, although the R√¢ja remained nominally in charge. After British occupation, the Bushahr state was by far the largest of the 28 Simla Hills States. There was a tax revolt by Bushahr's peasants in 1906. =Heads of State= The original seat of the rulers of the erstwhile Bushahr state was at the Kamru Fort, in the village of Kamru at the banks of the Baspa River at Sangla in Kinnaur. The fort is currently abandoned and houses an idol of Kamakhya Devi (Kamakshi Dev), which is believed to have been brought several centuries ago from Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. The rulers subsequently moved to Sarahan. The Palace of the \\"Raja of Bushahr state\\" at Sarahan (\\"The Srikhand view\\") was built by order of Raja Padam Singh for his lodging in September 1917. The current residence of the \\"Raja of Bushahr state\\" is at the Padam Palace at Rampur, Shimla district. The town of Rampur may have been founded by Raja Kehri Singh in the 17th century or by Raja Ram Singh in the 18th. The rulers moved down from their traditional seat in Sarahan to the banks of the river Sutlej. Bushair was one of the richest princely states in the hills and was an important center for trade between Tibet, Kinnaur and the lower areas. With a personal gun salute of 9 guns, the ruler of Bashahr was the only Hills \\"Raja\\" amongst India's upper class of princely salute states, but was not entitled to the style of His Highness until independence in 1947.

A materials science engineering graduate of Brown University, Shapiro has also received an SM in engineering from MIT and an SM in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management as a Leaders for Manufacturing Fellow (now Leaders for Global Operations program).http://lgo.mit.edu/ Both of these degrees from MIT were earned in 1991.Henderson et al., \\"Barriers to Effective Process Improvement\\", Production and Operations Management, Vol 7, No. 1, Spring 1998 He studied furniture design under Tage Frid and Hank Gilpin at the Rhode Island School of Design for two semesters and attended Harvard University's Graduate School of Design for the first year of a three year Master's program. Career From 2008 to 2012, Shapiro served as President of the Metropolitan Television Alliance, LLC (MTVA). The MTVA was formed by the New York area television broadcast stations shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Those attacks completely destroyed New York‚Äôs analog and digital over-the-air television broadcast infrastructure. The MTVA‚Äôs mission was to coordinate the recovery and the initial rebuilding of that infrastructure at the Empire State Building, and to locate and develop permanent facilities to replace those lost in 2001. This effort included the relocation of stations to temporary facilities in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the design and construction of analog and digital facilities at the Empire State Building to meet ongoing broadcast needs, and investigation of the design and construction of the possibility of facilities on top of One World Trade Center (the Freedom Tower). In addition, the MTVA investigated methods to further enhance over-the-air digital signals originating from the Empire State Building facility. This work was funded by a granthttp://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/otiahome/dtv/nyc911.html administered by the Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) within the National Telecommunications and Infrastructure Administration (NTIA), an office of the Department of Commerce. Previously Shapiro served four years as Vice President of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, covering the Media and Telecommunications sectors. He was responsible for attracting investment and expansion of domestic and international companies to NYC, and to serve as an advocate for companies and industries in their dealings with city government. Shapiro joined the EDC with experience stretching across both electronic media and telecommunications services and technology, including Sony, the FCC, ABC Television Network and the Internet. At Sony Corporation of America he served as Vice President of Broadband Services, responsible for new business opportunities based on emerging technologies and standards, with particular focus on the strategic integration of Sony‚Äôs US e-business initiatives.

Barrett Parkway Ernest W. Barrett Parkway (more commonly Barrett Parkway) is a major thoroughfare in the northwestern part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, in the north-central part of Cobb County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels from the southeastern edge of Kennesaw to a point north of Marietta, and continues on in both directions under other names. The portion of Barrett Parkway between Interstate 575 (I-575/SR 5) and US 41/SR 3 (Cobb Parkway) is designated State Route 5 Connector. The road is named after Ernest W. Barrett, the first chairman of the Cobb County Board of Commissioners in the 1960s, after home rule was enacted under a Georgia State Constitution amendment. The initial portion was constructed through Barrett family land, enabling it to be later sold for major development. Much of the original Barrett Parkway was taken from the two-lane Roberts Road, which generally went from Cobb Parkway (constructed around 1949 for US 41) to Bell's Ferry Road and served an area that was rural in nature. During the 1980s, dramatically-increased land development, most notably the extension of I-75 in 1977 (which cut Roberts Road in half south of Barrett Parkway), the construction of I-575 in 1980, and the completion of the major regional Town Center at Cobb shopping mall in 1986, strained the road to capacity, and was subsequently widened to six lanes (three in each direction, plus turn lanes) with a median by the Cobb County Department of Transportation. Turn lanes were only at the numerous traffic lights. In the mid-1990s, Barrett Parkway was extended by a completely new median-divided highway southwest of US 41 to Burnt Hickory Road, then by widening Ridgeway Road south to SR 120, west of the city of Marietta. This was briefly called West Cobb Parkway (which created potential confusion with Cobb Parkway). Today, Barrett Parkway is densely packed east of Old 41 Highway with major shopping centers and restaurants. West of Old 41 Highway, Barrett Parkway is mostly residential, but increasingly commercial near the intersection of SR 120 (Dallas Highway). The southeast side of the road is more affiliated with Marietta and the northwest more with Kennesaw. A large industrial park lies to the west. Stilesboro Road east from Barrett Parkway, and Old US 41 south from it, meet at the historic Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, next to the visitor center. Barrett Parkway is unique in that even though it is a major area route, it remains under local control (with exception to the state route portion) and was built entirely with county funds. Combined with the East‚ÄìWest Connector and Cumberland Parkway, the route doubly serves as a western bypass of Marietta and connects the two major malls of the county, Cumberland Mall and Town Center at Cobb. The route could possibly also carry a bypassed SR 5 in the future, as the city of Marietta has been planning to have it moved away from downtown Marietta entirely, though no action has yet been taken on that measure. Renaming In 2003, the county commission extended the name of the parkway southward along other roads. This included the short Ridgeway Road (to which the parkway itself was extended) which originally ran only from Burnt Hickory Road in the north, about south to SR 120\\\\. Villa Rica Road, which was realigned westward at SR 120 to meet Ridgeway to complete the loop, also had its parkway-widened portion renamed. Where a new highway was built to replace Villa Rica Road, what became \\"Old Villa Rica Road\\" at the time was then returned to being just \\"Villa Rica Road\\" again. The very short Villa Rica Way at SR 120 still retains that name, but was the original northern terminus for Villa Rica Road before its realignment to meet Ridgeway. As a result of these changes, the Barrett Parkway name now ends at the east‚Äìwest Connector near Austell. Its northeastern end is at Bells Ferry Road, east of which it continues as Piedmont Road (not to be confused with SR 237, the Piedmont Road in Atlanta). That road curves down around to the south, meeting SR 120 again on the other side of Marietta; here SR 120 is called Roswell Road. In November 2009, the long viaduct over the flood plain of Noses Creek and its tributary Ward Creek was named the William \\"Bill\\" G. Jordan Bridge, in honor of the civil engineer who designed it.The Marietta Daily Journal - Marietta bridge to be named after its creator. Mdjonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-28. It is located south of Villa Rica Road and north of Macland Road (SR 360) at . Due to the environmental impact, this was the last and most expensive section to be built. Widening Despite being only a few years old, the newer section of Barrett Parkway is already slated to be widened. After a small minority of residents approved a sales tax increase in a little-known referendum in September 2005, one of the projects to be funded is making it a six-lane highway from US 41 to SR 120. This would give it as many lanes as some much busier roads in the county, and would contradict promises made to residents before initial 1990s construction. It would also bring the highway right up to the backs of many homes. The project was expected at the time to cost nearly 50 million tax dollars, including 38 million from the special local option sales tax, which also taxes basic necessities like groceries. Reliever projects Previously, the only other east‚Äìwest route across the Town Center area was Chastain Road, one exit to the north on both I-75 and I-575, which travel parallel to each other between the Barrett and Chastain exits. Both of these are choked with traffic, particularly due to the mall (which can take nearly an hour to travel across during Christmas shopping weekends), and due to the rapid expansion of Kennesaw State University (KSU, which now covers several location distant from the main campus). Because of this, two new parallel routes were planned. , the South Barrett Reliever is partly completed, extending the four-lane divided Barrett Lakes Boulevard southwestward down formerly two-lane Greers Chapel Road to Cobb Parkway (where it continues as Ridenour Road, renamed from its historic name for a new development of expensive homes adjacent to it). This portion was completed by 2011. According to medium-range plans, the original Roberts Road behind (south of) Costco will later be widened in the same manner, and eventually reconnected with itself across I-75 south of The Home Depot on the other side. In longer-range plans, a new roadway will be constructed from this point eastward to Bells Ferry Road, including a second bridge across I-575. This would take the road through untouched forest and next to a neighborhood around Laura Lake, which feeds Noonday Creek. The North Barrett Reliever consisted of reconnecting the severed portions of Big Shanty Road, which from I-75's construction in the early 1970s until July 2012 traveled only from Bells Ferry Road west under I-575 to Busbee Parkway. Instead of terminating before I-75 as it did, it now continues west across a former go-kart track to the other side, crossing Barrett Lakes Boulevard and a bridge over an unnamed tributary of Noonday Creek, to meet the southern tip of a loop road south of Chastain Road. To carry traffic around the KSU area, the western half of that road was also widened to four-lane divided with turn lanes like the rest of Big Shanty Road (west of Chastain Meadows Parkway), and the name was changed to match as well, again making for a single continuous Big Shanty Road to all the way north of Chastain, and leaving the eastern half of the loop as a three-lane side street. To complete this, traffic on I-75 was detoured in 2011 onto temporary roadways in the very wide median where trees used to be, and much of the dirt removed to construct new bridges, a project done by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). Completed and opened in early June 2012, the detour roads and the rest of the dirt below them and the bridges was removed during the remainder of the month, and the already-completed portions of the road on either side were quickly connected under the bridges for the July opening. This new alternate route connects KSU with its new soccer stadium, and would also be a bus rapid transit station and an interchange with the reversible express lanes on the proposed Northwest Corridor HOV/BRT. There is also a further \\"wish list\\" that includes ramps from I-575 southbound to I-75 northbound, and vice versa, so that traffic will not have to use Chastain or Barrett to do so. However, this is unlikely to affect traffic, as very few cars do this, and the few motorists that do would be unlikely to make a backtrack of extra just to use the ramps. The ramps would also likely be expensive due to the large amount of rock in the area, as is seen on both freeways where they cross the ridge immediately north of where they split. Interchanges and traffic management The road was exit 116 and is now mile 269 on I-75. It was exit 1 and is still mile 1 on I-575, which originally had no northbound exit to or southbound entrance from Barrett Parkway. Those ramps were not built until the late 1980s or early 1990s, a few years after the mall opened. In August 2007, new ramp meters have been installed by GDOT on both the northbound and southbound entrance ramps, and were activated along with the others on I-575 in 2008, as part of the Georgia Navigator intelligent transportation system. Cobb DOT also operates a traffic camera at this interchange, at Mall Boulevard to its immediate west, at the southwest corner of the I-75 northbound intersection, and at Barrett Lakes Boulevard. Adverse conditions observed on these cameras are displayed on small variable message signs to drivers coming from the northwest on US 41, or from the southwest on Barrett Parkway, just before Old 41 (which becomes Main Street in Kennesaw and Kennesaw Avenue in Marietta). These are the last intersections before US 41 and Barrett meet, allowing drivers to take an alternate route if necessary. To the east, another camera is located at Piedmont Road and Canton Road, however there are no message signs in this direction. Elsewhere along the road, in either direction, there are no cameras or message signs at all.Traffic Maps :: Maps. Georgia Navigator. Retrieved on 2010-11-28. Other sections=East‚ÄìWest Connector= In southwest Cobb, at Powder Springs Road (original SR 5), Barrett Parkway changes name to East‚ÄìWest Connector, and bends southeast. Its intersection with Austell Road (currently SR 5) is a major commercial district, with a number of big-box retailers. The northwest corner is also home to Cobb Hospital. This section was constructed around 1986, while the section to Hicks Road was done in 1988. From here, it then travels east to SR 280 (South Cobb Drive), through the Concord Covered Bridge Historic District. In order to protect the historic covered bridge (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and the natural area around it, it does not connect with Concord Road (called Spring Road through Smyrna), but rather travels under it. Additionally, the bridge carrying it over the highway has wooden siding, so that it blends-in much better with the area, looking somewhat like a boxcar. A rust-colored bridge made of weathering steel carries the Silver Comet Trail over the highway. This section was built last while these concerns were addressed. This area is also notable for the deep, gorge- like cuts into the rock, like between the Silver Comet Trail and Concord Road overpasses.photos Built before the extension of Barrett Parkway, part of the eastward extension of this roadway was derived from an extended portion of Fontaine Road. The point where the two meet is now a trailhead for the Silver Comet Trail. =Cumberland Parkway= The highway becomes Cumberland Parkway at South Cobb Drive, and continues roughly northeast toward Atlanta Road (the original US 41; called Marietta Boulevard nearby in Atlanta). The northeast corner of that intersection is now home to a mixed-use development, which is in contrast to the newly developed residential area around it. The road continues generally northeastward, crossing I-285, and ending at Cumberland Boulevard, opposite the Costco entrance to Cumberland Mall. That entire stretch of roadway is in the Vinings area. =Piedmont Road= Piedmont Road is the continuation of Barrett Parkway on the northeastern end, heading east from Bells Ferry Road. From there, it crosses Canton Road (former SR 5) and Old Piedmont Road (a previous alignment), and the Georgia Northeastern Railroad tracks. It crosses Sandy Plains Road at the Sandy Plains community, and meets Allgood Road and then Sewell Mill Road, its original end before being extended to Roswell Road (SR 120) around 1987. This road was widened to four lanes in three phases during the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. It is mostly residential and entirely divided, with pin oak, holly, and other smaller trees in the medians, and left-turn lanes. This is the largest link between the mall and east Cobb.

The tunnel stretches under the Chapel- en-le-Firth to Glossop Road. Although one side has been blocked up, it remains one of the oldest rail-related tunnels in the world and was also the site of one of the earliest rail-related accidents, when a laden carriage rolled into two horses, killing them. History The tunnel was built in 1796 for the Peak Forest Tramway. Designed by Benjamin Outram, it was built out of gritstone with ashlar coping. Originally considered as an open cutting, it was designed in the style of canal tunnels, so as to not disturb the owners of the nearby Stodhart Lodge. It ran for about under the road between Chapel-en-le- Frith and Glossop, as a single track route. It remained a single-track route when the rest of the tramway was doubled, becoming a bottleneck on the line. The tunnel is also the site of one of the earliest railway accidents: six laden wagons broke free from their horses and rolled back into a following team, killing both horses and injuring an apprentice. One side of the tunnel was filled in during road realignment in 1949, so it is only accessible from the other side. The tunnel was designated a grade II* listed building on 3 September 1985 and is on the Buildings at Risk Register. From the 1950s part of the tunnel and about of track was tar sealed and used to test Ferodo brakes. The tunnel was used to test the effect of humidity on brakes. Until May 2013, it was considered to be the earliest rail-related tunnel in the world, but is now believed to be pre-dated by Fritchley Tunnel on the Butterley Gangroad at Fritchley, also in Derbyshire.

It is one of the most widely used techniques for activation and dissociation of mass selected precursor ion in MS/MS. It involves the direct introduction of low-energy electrons to trapped gas-phase ions.  History  Electron-capture dissociation was developed by Roman Zubarev and Neil Kelleher while in Fred McLafferty's lab at Cornell University. Irradiation of melittin 4+ ions and ubiquitin 10+ ions (trapped in FT-MS cell) by laser pulses not only resulted in peculiar c', z fragmentation but also charge reduction. It was suggested that if FT cell is modified to trap cations and electrons simultaneously, secondary electrons emitted by UV photons increases the charge reduction effect and c‚Ä≤, z‚Ä¢ fragmentation. Replacing UV laser with EI source led to the development of this new technique.  Principles  Electron- capture dissociation typically involves a multiply protonated molecule M interacting with a free electron to form an odd-electron ion. Liberation of the electric potential energy results in fragmentation of the product ion. :[\\\\ce{M} + n\\\\ce{H}]^{n+} + \\\\ce{e^- ->} \\\\bigg[ [\\\\ce{M} + n\\\\ce{H}]^{(n-1)+} \\\\bigg]^* \\\\ce{-> fragments}. Rate of electron capture dissociation not only depends on the frequency of ion‚Äìelectron fragmentation reactions but also on the number of ions in an ion‚Äìelectron interaction volume. Electron current density and cross-section of ECD is directly proportional to fragmentation frequency. An indirectly heated dispenser cathode used as an electron source results in larger electron current and larger emitting surface area. :\\\\text{Efficiency of ECD MS/MS} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total number(abundance) of fragment ions}}{\\\\text{Total number (abundance) of precursor ions}} ECD devices can be of two forms. It can trap analyte ions during the ECD stage or can undergo flow through mode where dissociation takes place as analyte ions flows continuously through the ECD region. Flow through mode has advantage over other mode because nearly all the analyte ion beam is used. However, that decreases the eÔ¨Éciency of ECD for flow through mode. ECD produces significantly different types of fragment ions (although primarily c- and z-type, b-ions have been identified in ECDLiu, H. & H√•kansson, K. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom (2007) 18: 2007. doi:10.1016/j.jasms.2007.08.015; Haselmann and Schmidt, RCM 21:1003-1008, 2007; Cooper JASMS 16:1932-1940, 2005.) than other MS/MS fragmentation methods such as electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) (primarily a and x types), collision-induced dissociation (CID) (primarily b and y type) and infrared multiphoton dissociation. CID and IRMPD introduce internal vibrational energy in some way or another, causing loss of post- translational modifications during fragmentation. In ECD, unique fragments (and complementary to CID) are observed, and the ability to fragment whole macromolecules effectively has been promising. Although ECD is primarily used in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, investigators have indicated that it has been successfully used in an ion-trap mass spectrometer.Baba et al., Anal. Chem., 76:4263‚Äì4266, 2004. ECD can also do rapid integration of multiple scans in FTICR-MS if put in a combination with external accumulation. ECD is a recently introduced MS/MS fragmentation technique and is still being investigated. The mechanism of ECD is still under debate but appears not to necessarily break the weakest bond and is therefore thought to be a fast process (nonergodic) where energy is not free to relax intramolecularly. Suggestions have been made that radical reactions initiated by the electron may be responsible for the action of ECD. In a similar MS/MS fragmentation technique called electron-transfer dissociation, the electrons are transferred by collision between the analyte cations and reagent anions.  Applications = Disulfide bond cleavage = ECD itself and combined with other MS is very useful for proteins and peptides containing multiple disulfide bonds. FTICR combined with ECD helps to recognize peptides containing disulfide bonds. ECD could also access important sequence information by activation of higher charged proteins. Moreover, disulfide bond cleavage takes place by ECD of multiply charge proteins or peptides produced by ESI. Electron capture by these proteins releases H atom, captured by the disulfide bond to cause its dissociation. :RS-SR' + \\\\bullet H -> R-S(H) \\\\bullet S-R' -> RSH{} + \\\\bullet SR' ECD with UV-based activation increases the top-down MS sequence coverage of disulfide bond containing proteins and cleaves a disulfide bond homolytically to produce two separated thiol radicals. This technique was observed with insulin and ribonuclease, which led them to cleave up to three disulfide bonds and increase the sequence coverage. = Post-translational modifications = ECD-MS fragments can retain posttranslational modifications such as carboxylation, phosphorylation and O-glycosylation. ECD has the potential to do the top-down characterization of the major types of posttranslational modifications in proteins. It successfully cleaved 87 of 208 backbone bonds and provided the first direct characterization of a phosphoprotein, bovine Œ≤ casein, simultaneously restricting the location of five phosphorylation sites. It has advantages over CAD to measure the degree of phosphorylation with a minimum number of losses of phosphates and for phosphopeptide/phosphoprotein mapping, which makes ECD a superior technique. Schematic diagram of Atmospheric pressure electron capture dissociation (AP-ECD) source = Coupling of ECD with separation techniques = ECD has been coupled with capillary electrophoresis (CE) to gain insight into structural analysis of mixture of peptides and protein digest. Micro-HPLC combined with ECD FTICR was used to analyze pepsin digest of cytochrome c. Sequence tags were provided by analysis of a mixture of peptides and tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin when LC ECD FTICR MS was used. Additionally, LC-ECD-MS/MS is provides longer sequence tags than LC-CID-MS/MS for identification of proteins. ECD devices using radio frequency quadrupole ion trap are relevant for high-throughput proteomics. Recently, Atmospheric pressure electron capture dissociation (AP-ECD) is emerging as a better technique because it can be implemented as a stand-alone ion-source device and doesn‚Äôt require any modification of the main instrument. = Proteomics = Analysis of proteins can be done by either using top-down or bottom-up approach. However, better sequence coverage is provided by top-down analysis. Combination of ECD with FTICR MS has resulted in popularity of this approach. It has also helped in determining the multiple modification sites in intact proteins. Native electron capture dissociation (NECD) was used to study cytochrome c dimer and has been recently used to elucidate iron-binding channels in horse spleen ferritin. = Synthetic polymers = ECD studies of polyalkene glycols, polyamides, polyacrylates and polyesters are useful for understanding composition of polymer samples. It has become a powerful technique to analyze structural information about precursor ions during MS/MS for synthetic polymers. ECD's single bond cleavage tendency makes the interpretation of product ion scans simple and easy for polymer chemistry.

He manufactured many revolvers for civilian and military use, including the Galand Revolver (also called the Galand-Sommerville or Galand-Perrin), the Tue Tue, and the tiny Le Novo. The Velo-dog, developed from the Tue Tue and the Novo, was designed by Charles-Fran√ßois' son Ren√© in 1904. The original Galand revolver was a double-action, open frame (no strap across the top of the cylinder) revolver patented in 1868. Military versions were produced in 9 mm while civilian versions were made in 12 mm. The gun is easily recognizable due to its long extraction lever, which stretches under the gun to form the trigger guard. Pulling the lever forward separates the barrel and cylinder from the rest of the gun. At the same time the extractor plate is blocked which catches any cartridges in the cylinder, thereby extracting them. The first model was manufactured both in Liege and in Birmingham, England by the British arms firm Braendlin and Sommerville, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Galand-Sommerville. Sommerville shared the patent for the case extracting system with Galand. The Galand-Perrin is an identical model which uses the Perrin cartridge (7 mm, 9 mm, and most famously 12 mm). The Galand's double-action mechanism allowed for rapid firing but the longer trigger pull made this less accurate than single-action fire. The Galand's self-extracting system made loading the revolver much faster than contemporary gate-loaded pistols such as the Colt Peacemaker. First distributed in October 1868, the Galand revolver sold briskly in France, at least in part due to fears over the looming Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Despite France's loss to the Germans the Galand performed successfully and the Imperial Russian Navy adopted the Galand model 1870 revolver in 1871. This revolver was manufactured under contract by Nagant and Goltiakoff in Russia in 1878. The Romanian Army also adopted the Galand. In 1872 Galand improved the design with a closed frame, but failed to win a French military contract and began aiming most of his production at the civilian market. In 1893 Galand introduced the 8 mm Tue Tue (kill kill) hammerless pocket revolver, which continued in production until about 1935. Later versions were also sold in .32 S&W; and .38 ACP, and some had an external hammer. The tiny Le Novo revolver, with a hinged trigger and no trigger guard, also featured a folding grip. After Charles-Fran√ßois Galand's death in 1900 his son, Ren√©, continued the business until 1942. He created the Velo-dog, a truly peculiar conceit in personal defence weapons. The name is a contraction of v√©locip√®de (bicycle) and dog. The weapon was originally marketed as a defence for bicyclists during the bicycle craze which started at the end of the 19th century. Like the Le Novo the Velodog originally used a 5.5 mm center fire cartridge; it was also available in .22 caliber and 6.35 mm.

He became famous for his paintings, mostly of animals and country landscapes. He was the first living self-taught artist to have a painting hung at the Tate in London, titled Cat and Mouse. Life Lloyd was the son of a policeman who had taken up farming. He had worked on his father's farm until the age of 19, when he too joined the police force. He had a variety of jobs before the war: gas-works stoker; bus conductor; builder's labourer; lamp-lighter; until he was accepted for the famous and exclusive British Army regiment of the Coldstream Guards. He served with distinction in his regiment overseas during the war. On demobilisation he married Nancy, she was a teenager and he in his forties, he returned to the land and took a job as a wagoner in Shropshire. He, his wife and four children bought a small holding at Triangle, near Halifax, in the Pennines. Although he had done some paintings as a young man, it was not until he was forty, that he began to paint in earnest. He and his family moved to Skirpenbeck, East Riding of Yorkshire in 1950. He took on the job as a cowman. There were now so many paintings, laboriously constructed dot by dot (pointillism). His wife Nancy decided it was time that Lloyd's work was seen by more people. Without telling her husband she wrote to Sir Herbert Read and he paid Lloyd a visit to see his paintings, and bought a couple of them. Herbert Read sent some to various galleries in London. In 1958 Lloyd held his first one-man show at (the late) Arthur Jeffress Gallery in London. All but 2 of the 32 paintings being held were sold within hours of opening. The rapidly expanding Lloyd family (eight children, and one who died young) moved to a council house further into the village and Lloyd took a job with the Derwent Plastics Company at Stamford Bridge, the money was better and the hours easier, he did shift work so he could paint by day and work by night. He devoted all his spare time (except for the pub) to painting. He never painted in a studio; he would usually just paint in the living room with the children playing around him. By the early 1960s he had stopped working at the Derwent Plastics factory to paint full- time. In 1961 he was commissioned by the York City Art Gallery under the Evelyn Award Scheme to paint the view of Cliffords Tower, York, for the gallery's collection. L.S. Lowry also produced a painting of Cliffords Tower. At the closure of Arthur Jeffress Gallery, Lloyd was taken on by the Portal Gallery, where his paintings still remain. His first one-man show there was in 1964 followed by others in 1966, 1968 and 1971. He never titled or dated his paintings. In 1963 Eric Lister of the Portal Gallery introduced Lloyd to film director Ken Russell. The result was that the BBC Monitor series made a television documentary film about his life and work, The Dotty World of James Lloyd. Two years later Lloyd was chosen to play (with no previous acting experience) the part of Henri Rousseau in Ken Russells 'Monitor' film on the great French naive painter, Always on Sunday.BRIEFING/WHO & WHY: Dose of BBC jitters The Observer 27 June 1965: 18. The photographer David Bailey bought several paintings by Lloyd and became a very good friend. When his book Goodbye Baby and Amen, an album of Bailey's portraits of celebrities of the 1960s was published, Lloyd featured prominently. He was also commissioned to paint a picture for the 1969/1971 book The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics. Other galleries who acquired his work were Leeds City Art Gallery, Bowes Museum and Thomas's College, York. He was also noticed by collectors abroad and his work was collected by Museums and Galleries as far apart as Caracas, Venezuela, and Zacreb, Yugoslavia. He won the International Best Primitive Painter Award in 1973, with his painting Boy with Horse.

He was also a liberation theologian and a supporter of the Fanmi Lavalas political party, as well as heading the Miami, Florida-based Haitian Refugee Center from 1977 to 1990. In 2004, he became internationally noted as an opponent of the interim government of Prime Minister G√©rard Latortue following the overthrow of the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat. He was arrested twice for his political work, leading Amnesty International to designate him a prisoner of conscience. In his obituary, the Associated Press described him as being \\"often considered the Martin Luther King Jr. of Haiti\\". Background G√©rard Jean-Juste was born in 1946 in Cavaillon, Haiti. A Roman Catholic, Jean-Juste attended a Canadian seminary before becoming the first Haitian to be ordained in the U.S. at Brooklyn's Church of St. Avila. Following his ordination, he worked for a time in a rural parish in Haiti, an experience which increased his commitment to liberation theology and the service of the poor. In 1971, however, Jean- Juste was asked to sign a loyalty oath to the Jean-Claude Duvalier government. He refused and fled to the U.S. There he served at Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross while also completing bachelor's degrees in engineering technology and civil engineering at Northeastern University. Observing the due process violations that many Haitian refugees faced in the 1970s, Jean-Juste founded the Miami-based Haitian Refugee Center to assist them. He would supervise the organization from 1977 to 1990. A major point of his advocacy was to change to the U.S.'s differing treatment of Cuban and Haitian refugees; Jean-Juste argued that while the former were treated as political and granted asylum accordingly, the latter were almost always viewed as economic refugees, despite having fled the dictatorship of Duvalier. As part of his work with the organization, Jean-Juste picketed Miami's Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy, calling him a racist for failing to advocate on behalf of refugees. As punishment, Jean-Juste was forbidden by his church superiors from celebrating Mass in the area. He also found himself in trouble with church hierarchy for conducting Catholic funeral services for refugees who had drowned at sea regardless of their religious background. Return to Haiti Jean-Juste returned to Haiti in 1991, becoming a \\"prominent supporter\\" of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, and his Fanmi Lavalas party. Following a military coup by Raoul C√©dras that unseated Aristide less than a year after his election, Jean-Juste then spent the next three years in hiding. When Aristide resumed office in 1994, Jean-Juste resumed his work as well, becoming rector of Saint Claire's church in Port-au- Prince. One of his legacies is a food program for hungry children in the St. Claire's neighborhood, which continues to be supported by the What If? Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Berkeley, CA. Opposition to the Latortue government and arrests In 2004, Aristide was again deposed by a military coup. Jean-Juste became an outspoken critic of the U.S.-supported interim government that followed, headed by G√©rard Latortue. He soon became a \\"target\\" of government pressure, leading a brief arrest in late 2004 on charges of hiding pro-Aristide soldiers. In July 2005, Jean-Juste and Fanmi Lavalas were accused by Haitian state media of involvement in the death of journalist Jacques Roche. Roche, a columnist for Le Matin had been kidnapped on July 10, held for ransom, and \\"tortured with extreme cruelty\\" before being found dead four days later. When attending Roche's funeral on July 21, Jean- Juste was attacked by a group of mourners and arrested; he was then held without charges on suspicion of involvement in the murder. As Jean-Juste had been in Miami for the duration of the kidnapping, international organizations generally found the charges to be \\"laughable\\". His New York Times obituary, for example, describes the charges as \\"universally regarded as politically motivated\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for the legitimate expression of his opinions\\". Signs calling for Jean-Juste's release reportedly became a common sight around the Miami neighborhood of Little Haiti. At the time of his arrest, Jean-Juste was being considered as a Fanmi Lavalas candidate for the 2006 presidential election. However, electoral authorities ruled that Jean-Juste could not be properly registered as a candidate due to his incarceration, prompting Fanmi Lavalas to threaten to boycott the poll. Jean-Juste later endorsed the eventual winner, Ren√© Pr√©val. Leukemia and release In late December 2005, Paul Farmer, a U.S. physician who co-founded Partners in Health, examined Jean-Juste and confirmed that he had chronic lympocytic leukemia, telling a reporter that \\"Father Gerry's in serious trouble if he isn't released from jail to receive proper medical attention in the United States.\\" Jean-Juste was given temporary release from prison to seek care in Miami in early 2006. However, he returned to Haiti in November 2007 to defend himself against the still-pending charges. When asked about his experience with weapons, he replied, \\"My rosary is my only weapon\\".

Stubbs is best known for his work and promotion of country music on WSM, a radio station with a nighttime clear channel signal broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, United States. He was also one of two regular announcers for the long-running Grand Ole Opry carried on WSM on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights. He was on the air on weekday evenings from 7 pm to midnight, Central Time, on WSM. WSM's powerful nighttime clear channel signal allows WSM to be heard in a large part of the US and Canada. As a result, Stubbs has many regular listeners in all parts of the US and Canada in areas far away from Nashville. A fifth-generation resident of Montgomery County, Maryland, he graduated from Gaithersburg High School and became a fiddle player with a traditional bluegrass band, The Johnson Mountain Boys. After a decade, the band split up and Stubbs has only played sporadically since. Stubbs' first radio job was a weekly bluegrass show for WYII in Williamsport, Maryland, in 1983 where he earned $20 per program. In 1984, he was hired by WAMU in Washington, D.C. and worked alongside the veteran country deejay Gary Henderson. He received his own show in 1990 but continued to do odd-jobs such as house-painting to supplement his income. \\"No one gets rich in radio\\", he observed. The Eddie Stubbs Show on WAMU was discontinued in April 2007. He developed a friendship with the country singer Kitty Wells and her husband, the guitar player and singer Johnnie Wright, and played with them during D.C. area appearances. They eventually convinced Stubbs to move to Nashville in 1995 and join them full-time. But within seventeen days of arriving in the country music capital, he was hired by The Grand Ole Opry as a regular announcer. \\"Five people up for the job, and the new kid in town gets the gig? If that's not God, I don't know what is,\\" said Stubbs. In 2002, Stubbs was named the Country Music Association's Large Market Air Personality of the Year. The alternative weekly, Nashville Scene, named him Best Country Deejay, and he has also been listed in Nashville Life Magazine's \\"100 Coolest People\\". On July 21, 2020, Stubbs announced that he is retiring from WSM and the Grand Ole Opry, effective July 29, 2020. In October 2020, he was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame as a member of the Johnson Mountain Boys.

Seated at the head of the Senegal River, the Khasso kingdom was composed of FulasIn ; in . who had immigrated to the area and integrated with the local Malink√© and Sonink√© populations. S√©ga Doua (r. 1681 - 1725) is remembered as the first Fankamala (king) of the Khasso, and his dynasty would last until the death of his descendant Demba S√©ga in 1796. Following a civil war between his sons Dibba Samballa et Demba Maddy, the kingdom fragmented into five smaller states, the most powerful of which was Dembaya under Hawa Demba Diallo (r. 1810-1833). Like the Bambara Empire to the east, the Khasso kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the European settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the French. In 1857, Toucouleur conqueror El Hadj Umar Tall attacked the Khasso as part of his jihad, but was repulsed at Medina Fort with the aid of the Khasso's French allies, particularly General Louis Faidherbe. However, the Khasso found themselves increasingly under French control until they were assimilated into French Sudan in 1880.

Storyline=2001= Alpha Team started out as a basic top secret group, under the leadership of Dash Justice. At that time, Ogel had made evil orbs that could turn ordinary civilians into mindless drones to serve as his slaves. However, he was defeated when Alpha Team entered the picture and broke the power of the evil orbs to restore the drones back to normal. They captured Ogel and destroyed the orb machine (found in the Alpha Team video game). However, Ogel managed to escape. =2002= In 2002, Alpha Team changed slightly. The toyline is known as Mission: Deep Sea. Ogel is back with more sinister looking drones that remained from the year 2001. Ogel also had re-engineered the evil orb so that it causes mutations and uses it to mutate sea creatures to serve him. Ogel's left hand was replaced by a transparent red hook that can still hold things (the Lego minifigure). It is uncertain of how he got the red hook. Rumor has it that he lost his left hand while battling Alpha Team. Alpha Team's helper, TeeVee (a television with legs and antennae) can now turn into a deep sea rover for small openings and scouting around the sea embankment. In the webtoon, Into the Deep, Ogel's sinister plan for the mutant sea animals was destroyed when Dash reversed the orb factory controls, thus reverting all the sea animals back to normal. However, Ogel escaped again by detaching the cockpit on his Mutant Squid vehicle. =2003= Alpha Team did not appear this year, with only a promotional set, \\"Dash The Diver\\", being released. =2004= Alpha Team went into a massive revision. The Alpha Team symbol was changed, Crunch and Cam were replaced by Diamond Tooth and Arrow (respectively), and Ogel replaced his red hook with a transparent blue hook. Alpha Team has more tech than usual. Their vehicles have a new feature: they can initiate Alpha Mode, a feature that transforms one vehicle to another without disassembling and rebuilding. This time, Ogel's plan has gone from mind controlling to causing damage to the world. His plan was to freeze the world at his base in Antarctica with ice orbs, and as revealed later, to freeze time itself as well. Ice Orbs are completely different from the evil orbs Ogel made earlier, as they no longer cause mutations/brainwashing, but instead freeze everything on touch. Alpha Team tracked him down to Antarctica and ended up battling each other. While Alpha Team raced to Ogel's fortress in a desperate gamble to stop him from freezing time, Ogel ended up freezing almost all of Alpha Team. However, Charge and TeeVee couldn't be found in the iceboxes. =2005= When all hope was lost, drones started to behave randomly and they began to steal interesting landmarks. Then Zed, a special agent of Alpha Team, arrived at Antarctica. He melted the ice around the other agents and set off on his own mission. While the other agents were stopping Ogel's drones, Ogel appeared in the Scorpion Orb Launcher, his own vehicle that could convert into the Viper Escape. Ogel and Zed battled. At the same time, the Lego Magazine had invited fans to write their own stories of who won and what will happen next. The Lego Magazine didn't show the results, but it was assumed that Zed had won the conflict and the world was restored to normal. While the Lego Company didn't give the 2004 subtheme an official name, (like Mission Deep Sea) fans coined the name \\"Mission Deep Freeze\\" for the series. Characters=Alpha Team= Main Characters *Dash Justice: The main protagonist of Alpha Team. Motion Expert and Team Leader. Very brave but quite cocky. Loves the seaside. Team Color: Black/Blue *Crunch: Explosives Expert. Team Color: Green *Radia: Lasers Expert. She controls the cockpit area in the Mobile Command Center. Extremely beautiful. Team Color: Purple/Pink *Charge: Electricity Expert. His gloves apparently allow him to fly with jets in them, as shown on the cover of the video game. Team Color: Blue/Red *Cam Attaway: Motors Expert and mechanic. Team Color: Red *Flex: Ropes expert. Team Color: Orange *Diamond Tooth: Mining Expert. Team Color: Green *Arrow: Alpha Team mechanic. Team Color: Yellow Other Characters *Gearbox: All that is known about this agent is that he built the Tundra Tracker. *Zed: Special agent and the pilot of the Blizzard Blaster. Team color: Silver *Tee-Vee: Team's assistant. TeeVee, as the name suggests, was originally a Television with legs. He then became an underwater robot for Mission Deep Sea. In the final mission for Alpha Team, he was a fully functional android. =Ogel= *Ogel: The ruthless villain of the series. He has been the main villain in each year of the series, constantly coming up with schemes to defeat Alpha Team. His first plot was to use Mind Control Orbs to turn regular people into mindless skeleton-like Drones. These Drones were reverted to normal when the Orbs were destroyed. Ogel returned the following year with a new plan to use mutated sea creatures to control the world's oceans. That plan was thwarted when Agent Dash reversed the controls to the Orb making machine. Ogel's underwater base was destroyed, but Ogel escaped before it exploded. His most recent plan for domination was freezing the world with new Ice Orbs that could freeze anything. His plan succeeded, but he was then stopped by special agent Zed in his Blizzard Blaster. He used to be in love with Radia. \\"Ogel\\" is LEGO spelled backwards. In an issue of the LEGO Club Magazine, it was explained that this was due to him representing the exact opposite of LEGO (LEGO is fun, Ogel hates fun, etc.). Ogel is a direct descendant of Vladek, a villain in the Knights Kingdom series. . Greg Farshtey, the writer of Bionicle, Lego Exo-Force, and Alpha Team, among others, has stated that he is his favorite non-Bionicle villain. This Ogel is the main antagonist villain of Alpha Team. *Skeleton Drones: Ogel's minions, who are people who have been affected by Mind Control Orbs. Their appearance changes numerous times during the series. *Super Ice Drone: A Skeleton Drone with a black head that pilots the Scorpion Orb Launcher. Evil Orbs An Evil Orb is Ogel's main tool for all the missions. There are three types. *Mind Control Orb: This orb takes control of ordinary Lego Town citizens and turns them into skeleton-like mindless drones. *Mind Control Orb 2.0: Same as first, only it also causes mutations and allows Ogel to take over mutated sea creatures minds as well as humans. *Ice Orb: Freezes anything it touches. Ogel Bases Ogel has had several bases in the series. *Ogel Island Laboratories: Ogel grows the plants used in the evil orbs here in his massive greenhouses and ships them out in Plant Shipping Crates. They are sent out by his Trouble Train. *Goo Caverns: Ogel harvests the goo from his Trouble Train used in the evil orbs here which are put in barrels. Both Plant Shipping Crates and barrels of goo are put in his Trouble Sub and shipped to the Deep Sea Orb Factory. *Deep Sea Orb Factory: The plants and goo are unloaded from his Trouble Sub. Also, all the components of the evil orbs are put together here, at the D.O.O.M. (Device for Ominous Orb Manufacturing) Machine. *Ogel's Hidden Arctic Command Base: Ogel loads the evil orbs from his undersea base onto the Boggle Rocket here. His plan was to launch them all over the world and turn everyone into his slaves. =Bases Found in Sets= Ogel has several bases in the form of LEGO sets. All of his hideouts have a big skull on them . *Ogel Control Center: Ogel and his drones load Evil Orbs into the Boggle Rocket, allowing him to drop them on civilians and turn the world into his slave. This set differs from the other bases as Dash usually makes a second appearance in a smaller vehicle. *Ogel's Mission Deep Sea Base: This base allows Ogel to fire menacing Evil Orb Missiles at unsuspecting AT agents by surprise. It sports a missile launcher, two Skeleton Drones, two Orb Missiles, and Evil Orb and Ogel as defense forces. This set also featured Dash in his AT Sub. And also included Ogel's Aqua-Gator. (A sub that is made to look like an alligator.) *Ogel Mountain Fortress This is where ice orbs are created and where Ogel hatches the plan to freeze the world. In the set, it includes Ogel, two drones, and two Alpha team agents: Arrow and Dash. The set also includes the Solar Speeder: the Alpha team scout vehicle equipped with only a missile launcher that can open the gate of Ogel's fortress.

It is the most common type of heat exchanger in oil refineries and other large chemical processes, and is suited for higher-pressure applications. As its name implies, this type of heat exchanger consists of a shell (a large pressure vessel) with a bundle of tubes inside it. One fluid runs through the tubes, and another fluid flows over the tubes (through the shell) to transfer heat between the two fluids. The set of tubes is called a tube bundle, and may be composed of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Theory and application Two fluids, of different starting temperatures, flow through the heat exchanger. One flows through the tubes (the tube side) and the other flows outside the tubes but inside the shell (the shell side). Heat is transferred from one fluid to the other through the tube walls, either from tube side to shell side or vice versa. The fluids can be either liquids or gases on either the shell or the tube side. In order to transfer heat efficiently, a large heat transfer area should be used, leading to the use of many tubes. In this way, waste heat can be put to use. This is an efficient way to conserve energy. Heat exchangers with only one phase (liquid or gas) on each side can be called one- phase or single-phase heat exchangers. Two-phase heat exchangers can be used to heat a liquid to boil it into a gas (vapor), sometimes called boilers, or to cool the vapors and condense it into a liquid (called condensers), with the phase change usually occurring on the shell side. Boilers in steam engine locomotives are typically large, usually cylindrically-shaped shell-and-tube heat exchangers. In large power plants with steam-driven turbines, shell-and- tube surface condensers are used to condense the exhaust steam exiting the turbine into condensate water which is recycled back to be turned into steam in the steam generator. They are also used in liquid-cooled chillers for transferring heat between the refrigerant and the water in both the evaporator and condenser, and in air-cooled chillers for only the evaporator. Shell and tube heat exchanger design There can be many variations on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent in the shape of a U, called U-tubes. File:U-tube heat exchanger.PNG In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. File:Straight-tube heat exchanger 1-pass.PNG Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. File:Straight-tube heat exchanger 2-pass.PNG There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance. Counter current heat exchangers are most efficient because they allow the highest log mean temperature difference between the hot and cold streams. Many companies however do not use two pass heat exchangers with a u-tube because they can break easily in addition to being more expensive to build. Often multiple heat exchangers can be used to simulate the counter current flow of a single large exchanger. =Selection of tube material= To be able to transfer heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through the width of the tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure. =Applications and uses= The simple design of a shell and tube heat exchanger makes it an ideal cooling solution for a wide variety of applications. One of the most common applications is the cooling of hydraulic fluid and oil in engines, transmissions and hydraulic power packs. With the right choice of materials they can also be used to cool or heat other mediums, such as swimming pool water or charge air. There are many advantages to shell and tube technology over plates: * One of the big advantages of using a shell and tube heat exchanger is that they are often easy to service, particularly with models where a floating tube bundle is available.Heat Exchanger Shell Bellows Piping Technology and Products, (retrieved March 2012)(where the tube plates are not welded to the outer shell). It is particularly interesting in applications where the cold medium is charged with particles or prone to fouling: it is the case for marine applications and the maintenance of heat exchangers with shell and tube technology is quick and efficient compared to other technologies. * The cylindrical design of the housing is extremely resistant to pressure and allows all ranges of pressure applications Design and construction standards * Standards of the Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA), 9th edition, 2009 * EN 13445-3 \\"Unfired Pressure Vessels - Part 3: Design\\", Section 13 (2012) * ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, Part UHX See also *Boiler or Reboiler *EJMA *Fired heater *Fouling or scaling *Heat exchanger *NTU method as an alternative to finding the LMTD *Plate and frame heat exchanger *Plate fin heat exchanger *Pressure vessel *Surface condenser ReferencesExternal links *Shell- and-Tube Heat Exchangers Construction Details *Basics of Shell and Tube Exchanger Design *Basics of Industrial Heat Transfer *Specifying a Liquid_Liquid Heat Exchanger *A Free Book - Thermal Design of Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers *Shell and tube heat exchanger calculator for shellside Category:Heat exchangers ","title":"Shell and tube heat exchanger"},{"id":"2289175","text":"The Khassonk√© heartland in Mali.

The bridge passes over Canoe Pass in the Fraser River Estuary and connects Ladner with Westham Island. The bridge's length is approximately 325 m (1066 feet). The bridge was constructed between 1909 and 1912 and has undergone extensive refitting over the years.  Improvements = Electrical Swing Motor = Electrical operation of the swing span was adapted in 1974. Previous to that time the bridge was manually operated by lifting a steel plate in the deck of the bridge and inserting a ten-foot bar into a lever. The operator would walk in a clockwise circle to open the span for marine traffic and then reverse the operation to close. The bridge still has this manual capacity. Remarkably a single-armed gentleman operated the bridge in this fashion until the age of 71, retiring when the electrical motor was installed. = Increase Load Restrictions = TransLink contracts Mainroad Contracting Ltd. and improves the load restriction to 50 tonnes (originally 20 tonnes).  Popularity  Part of the bridge consists of one of the few remaining wooden 'Howe Trusses' in existence and has been recognized and storied by both 'Canadian' and 'National' Geographic Societies. It is an occasional chosen location for film and TV productions. One of the most famous was an episode of the X-Files TV series, \\"Kill Switch\\". The bridge is a favourite of photographers in general and particularly bird-watchers as Westham Island Road is also the only route by road to the Riefel Island Bird Sanctuary. It is one of the oldest swing-bridges operating in BC. TransLink, the regional transportation authority, is responsible for the bridge. The bridge opens on request for marine traffic.

Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a just cause removal of an elected official by statute or recall election. Malfeasance in office contrasts with \\"misfeasance in office\\", which is the commission of a lawful act, done in an official capacity, that improperly causes harm; and \\"nonfeasance in office,\\" which is the failure to perform an official duty. An exact definition of malfeasance in office is difficult: many highly regarded secondary sources (such as books and commentaries) compete over its established elements based on reported cases. This confusion has arisen from the courts where no single consensus definition has arisen from the relatively few reported appeal-level cases involving malfeasance in office. England and Wales Under English law, misconduct in public office is a criminal offence at common law which dates back to the 13th century.Crown Prosecution Service - Guidelines on Misconduct In Public Office The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It is confined to those who are public office holders, and is committed when the office holder acts (or neglects to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office. The Crown Prosecution Service guidelines on this offence say that the elements of the offence are when: # A public officer acting as such. # Wilfully neglects to perform one's duty and/or wilfully misconducts oneself. # To such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in the office holder.In the decision not to prosecute Damian Green the Director of Public Prosecutions formulated this as \\"the breach must have been such a serious departure from acceptable standards as to constitute a criminal offence; and to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in the public official;\\" citing the Court of Appeal in the case of Attorney General's Reference No.3 of 2003 [2004] EWCA Crim 868 # Without reasonable excuse or justification. The similarly-named misfeasance in public office is a tort. In the House of Lords judgement on the BCCI case, it was held that this had three essential elements:House of Lords judgements on Three Rivers District Council and Others v. The Governor and Company of The Bank of England # The defendant must be a public officer # The defendant must have been exercising his power as a public officer # The defendant is either exercising targeted malice or exceeding his powers \\"Misconduct in public office\\" is often but inaccurately rendered as \\"misconduct in a public office\\", which has a different meaning. United States The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals summarized a number of the definitions of malfeasance in office applied by various appellate courts in the United States. The court then went on to use yet another definition, \\"malfeasance is the doing of an act which an officer had no legal right to do at all and that when an officer, through ignorance, inattention, or malice, does that which they have no legal right to do at all, or acts without any authority whatsoever, or exceeds, ignores, or abuses their powers, they are guilty of malfeasance.\\" Nevertheless, a few \\"elements\\" can be distilled from those cases. First, malfeasance in office requires an affirmative act or omission. Second, the act must have been done in an official capacity‚Äîunder the color of office. Finally, that that act somehow interferes with the performance of official duties‚Äîthough some debate remains about \\"whose official\\" duties. In addition, jurisdictions differ greatly over whether intent or knowledge is necessary. As noted above, many courts will find malfeasance in office where there is \\"ignorance, inattention, or malice\\", which implies no intent or knowledge is required. See also * Abuse of power * F.

On August 12, 2003, Rountree walked into the First American Bank (now Citibank N.A.) in Abilene, Texas, to hand a large envelope to the teller marked \\"robbery.\\" Moments later, Rountree sped off in a 1996 Buick Regal with $2,000.00 in small bills. He was arrested shortly thereafter when a witness wrote down his car license plate number. The robbery at First American Bank was his third in five years. Rountree's first robbery took place in 1998 when at the age of 86, he held up SouthTrust Bank in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was arrested shortly afterward and was later convicted. Rountree was sentenced to three years probation. His second robbery was at Nations Bank in Pensacola, Florida. He was again caught and convicted, this time receiving a sentence of three years in prison. Rountree's third and final heist earned the then 91-year-old man 12 years in federal prison. He died at US Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri on October 12, 2004. Rountree claimed the loss of a considerable fortune, including the Rountree Machinery Company, was the motivation for his crimes. He believed a Corpus Christi, Texas bank was responsible for his personal bankruptcy. A documentary based on the story of Rountree, This Is Not A Robbery was an official selection for the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.

The coconut-based alcoholic beverage is similar to eggnog, sometimes being called the Puerto Rican Eggnog. The mixed drink is made with Puerto Rican rum, coconut milk, cream of coconut, and sweetened condensed milk. Eggs and other spices and flavoring can be added, such as ginger, lemon zest, star anise, cinnamon, and cloves.Coquito Recipe - Puerto Rican Rum Eggnog  History  The traditional Christmas drink, Coquito, was originally found in Puerto Rico. However, drinks similar to Coquito can be found all throughout the Caribbean. There are two different theories about the origin of the drink. Some believe the person who created Coquito is unknown along with how the recipe began. Others say that the Puerto Rican drink was brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish during Puerto Rico's colonial period. The Spanish took their version of \\"eggnog\\" and combined it with the local rum creating Coquito. As they continued to travel and settle in other areas the drink followed them creating different variations around the Caribbean. The variations are very similar to what they considered the original recipe: egg, milk, sugar, and spirit. Although this was seen as the original ingredients, Puerto Rico altered it by adding coconut. The recipe has 4 main ingredients: 1. Coconut Milk 2. Coconut Cream 3. Puerto Rican rum and 4. Sweetened Condensed Milk, but is not limited to these. The Puerto Rican mix drink resembles eggnog and is usually served after dinner in a shot glass. The drink is known to be sweet and strong (with rum). Many families have their own variations of the recipe that are passed down through generations. The drink will be seen as early as Thanksgiving and as late as D√≠a de los Reyes. That being said the drink makes its main appearance during the Christmas season. Coquito has become much more popular as more people hear about the drink. The drink can be found bottled in supermarkets and grocery stores for consumers to buy pre-made. Along with being in stores, there are competitions like Coquito Masters, which is an annual competition at the Museo del Barrio in New York City. Variations There are many variations of Coquito based on location and family traditions. Although all these variations are unique in their own way, they all have one thing in common and that is rum. Coquito can be served in shot glasses or small cups and is usually garnished with grated nutmeg or cinnamon. Preparation Depending on the ingredient of choice, Coquito can be prepared over the stove top or in a blender. If looking for convenience, a quick way to prepare Coquito is to process the ingredients in a blender with the option of using ground spices for more flavor. After Coquito is prepared and chilled for a few hours it is ready to be served.  Events  El Museo del Barrio in New York City hosts an annual Coquito Tasting Contest called Coquito Masters on Three Kings Day in January. The competition was first established in 2002 and continues each year. The Competitors bring forth their best recipes including traditional ingredients as well as fusion mixes.

The rifle is only used by Finland. History The rifle was developed in the late 1980s in response to a requirement to replace the 7.62mm RK 62 service rifle. Between 1988 and 1990, the SAKO company developed the M90 prototype, which was a substantially upgraded variant of the RK 62. Changes to the original design included the fire control and safety selector, whose lever was transferred to the left side of the receiver housing, the cocking handle cut-out in the bolt carrier assembly was covered with a strip of metal. The cocking handle itself was placed at an upward angle (enhancing left-handed reloading), the rear sight assembly was installed on a sliding tangent with 150 and 300 m range adjustments and the rifle was equipped with a folding tubular stock with a latch modeled on the locking solution employed in the SIG SG 540 rifle. The M90 was also equipped with a multifunction muzzle device and manual gas valve, enabling the use of rifle grenades. Some advertisements released in Finland in the 1990s suggested that SAKO was going to produce the M90 in 5.56 NATO caliber. However, this type was never produced. Two prototypes were developed by SAKO, known as the RK 92, were delivered to the FDF for combat trials.http://www.redstararms.com/uploads/ak295TP.pdf After undergoing further testing and implementing several changes (among them, the selector mechanism was reverted to the familiar RK 62 configuration) the rifle was introduced into service with the Finnish Army as the 7.62 RK 95 TP. Deliveries to the Finnish started in 1995 and ended at 1997 with further orders ceasing in 1998.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=3512http://www.military- today.com/firearms/sako_m95.htm The first RK 95 with the serial number 960,001 was presented by SAKO representatives to the Military Museum in Helsinki, which is on display. Prior to the adoption of the RK 95, several Chinese and East German-based AKs were purchased by Finland to easily arm mobilized Finnish soldiers in the 90s. In 2015, the RK 95 is supplemented by the FN SCAR-L, which is used by Finnish special forces units.https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/02/27/finland-adopts-scar-l- for-special-forces/ Design details Marine with RK 95 TP assault rifles. in U.S. and Finland exercises in Black Sea Rotational Force 2014. =Operating mechanism= The RK 95 TP is a select-fire, gas-operated firearm using the Kalashnikov-pattern operating system with a long stroke gas piston rod coupled to the bolt carrier as in the AK rifle. The rotating bolt locks into battery via two locking lugs. =Features= The weapon's spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and enclosed in one of the locking lugs while the ejector is a fixed protrusion of the internal bolt carrier guide rail. The firearm uses a hammer-type firing mechanism and a trigger group that enables semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. The fire selector switch, which is also the manual safety toggle, can occupy one of three positions: the top \\"safe\\" setting (the trigger and bolt carrier are both disabled mechanically), the middle setting (marked with three dot symbols) produces continuous fire and the bottom setting (single dot) activates a disconnector for single fire mode. The weapon's barrel has a multipurpose muzzle attachment, which performs the role of a muzzle brake, flash suppressor and a mounting base for launching rifle grenades. The gas block incorporates a manually adjustable gas regulator that isolates and disconnects the gas system in the closed position and a lug at its base‚Äîused to attach a blade bayonet (i.e. KCB-type bayonet). The RK 95 TP has a plastic-coated tubular metal shoulder stock that folds to the right side and features an internal compartment used to store a cleaning rod. Both the forward handguard and pistol grip are made of a lightweight synthetic. For maintenance the weapon is field stripped into the following components: the receiver and barrel, bolt carrier, bolt, return mechanism, gas tube, receiver cover and magazine. =Feeding= The RK 95 TP is chambered for the intermediate 7.62√ó39mm M43 cartridge, due to its reliability in cold and harsh weather/terrain conditions. The rifle feeds from curved box magazines made of an impact- resistant polymer (empty weight: 0.16 kg), with a 30-round capacity of double- stacked cartridges. These magazines are also interchangeable with standard AK-47/AKM magazines. =Sights= The rifle comes with adjustable iron sights, consisting of a forward post and an L-shaped dual-aperture rear flip sight with settings for firing at ranges of 150 and 300 m. The front sight, corrected for windage and elevation, is mounted in a semi-shrouded post on top of the gas block, and the rear sight‚Äîon the receiver top cover. For operation in low-level lighting conditions the rifle uses subdued self-luminous tritium gas vials, installed in a separate folding post attached to the base of the front sight and deployed manually, and in the rear sight assembly in a fixed notch sight, exposed by rotating the rear sight arm 180¬∞ forward around its pivot axis. Additionally the rifle can be adapted to use various optical sights (i.e. the Trijicon ACOG or night vision equipment such as the Patria VV 2000 passive night sight), through the use of a receiver-mounted side- rail.http://www.redstararms.com/uploads/ak295TP.pdf A detachable cheek riser is employed when using optics. =Accessories= The rifle can be used with a barrel-mounted bipod or a 40 mm underslung grenade launcher attachment. A railed gas block attachment was also developed for the weapon and is used to mount tactical accessories. It can also use a mounted suppressor. Variants=M92S= A civilian 7.62mm-caliber semi-automatic variant was manufactured and marketed as the M92S.http://americanshootingjournal.com/sako-m92s-based- on-the-ak/ This was marketed to civilians, as well as for law enforcement sales. One way to tell this apart from the RK 95 TP is the absence of an automatic sear axis. =M95S= The M95S is a semi-auto variant of the RK 95 TP. =M95 (5.56 NATO)= An export variant of the rifle was also produced, modified to use the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge with the SS109 bullet, fed from plastic 30-round curved magazines. The barrel has four right-hand grooves with a rifling twist rate of 185 mm (1:7 in), and has a muzzle velocity of using standard ammunition. Small numbers of this variant were made in order to show to clients for potential contracts that call for the purchase of the RK 95 TP in 5.56 NATO caliber in trade shows and arms conventions.

It was initially developed by O.D.L. Strack at the University of Minnesota. It is similar in nature to the boundary element method (BEM), as it does not rely upon discretization of volumes or areas in the modeled system; only internal and external boundaries are discretized. One of the primary distinctions between AEM and BEMs is that the boundary integrals are calculated analytically. Flow around impermeable cylinders. Solved with the AEM using 20 coefficients in the series expansions.  Mathematical basis  The basic premise of the analytic element method is that, for linear differential equations, elementary solutions may be superimposed to obtain more complex solutions. A suite of 2D and 3D analytic solutions (\\"elements\\") are available for different governing equations. These elements typically correspond to a discontinuity in the dependent variable or its gradient along a geometric boundary (e.g., point, line, ellipse, circle, sphere, etc.). This discontinuity has a specific functional form (usually a polynomial in 2D) and may be manipulated to satisfy Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin (mixed) boundary conditions. Each analytic solution is infinite in space and/or time. Commonly each analytic solution contains degrees of freedom (coefficients) that may be calculated to meet prescribed boundary conditions along the element's border. To obtain a global solution (i.e., the correct element coefficients), a system of equations is solved such that the boundary conditions are satisfied along all of the elements (using collocation, least- squares minimization, or a similar approach). Notably, the global solution provides a spatially continuous description of the dependent variable everywhere in the infinite domain, and the governing equation is satisfied everywhere exactly except along the border of the element, where the governing equation is not strictly applicable due to the discontinuity. The ability to superpose numerous elements in a single solution means that analytical solutions can be realized for arbitrarily complex boundary conditions. That is, models that have complex geometries, straight or curved boundaries, multiple boundaries, transient boundary conditions, multiple aquifer layers, piecewise varying properties and continuously varying properties can be solved. Elements can be implemented using far-field expansions such that model containing many thousands of elements can be solved efficiently to high precision. The analytic element method has been applied to problems of groundwater flow governed by a variety of linear partial differential equations including the Laplace, the Poisson equation, the modified Helmholtz equation, the heat equation, and the biharmonic equations. Often theses equations are solved using complex variables which enables using mathematical techniques available in complex variable theory. A useful technique to solve complex problems is using conformal mapping which maps the boundary of a geometry, e.g. an ellipse, onto the boundary of the unit circle where the solution is known. In the analytic element method the discharge potential and stream function, or combined the complex potential, is used. This potential links the physical properties of the groundwater system, the hydraulic head or flow boundaries, to a mathematical representation in a potential. This mathematical representation can be used to calculate the potential in terms of position and thus also solving groundwater flow problems. Elements are developed by solving the boundary conditions for either of these two properties, hydraulic head or flow boundary, which results in analytical solutions capable of dealing with numerous boundary conditions. A contemporary student of Strack's who is a proponent of the Analytic Element Method (AEM) in groundwater modeling applications is Dr. David Steward of Kansas State University.  Comparison to other methods  As mentioned the analytic element method thus not rely on discretization of volume or area in the model, as in the finite elements or finite different methods. Thus, it can model complex problem with an error on the order of machine precision. This is illustrated in a study which modeled a highly heterogeneous, isotropic aquifer by including 100,000 spherical heterogeneity with a random conductivity and tracing 40,000 particles. The analytical element method can efficiently be used as verification or as a screening tool in larger projects as it may fast and accurately calculate the groundwater flow for many complex problems. In contrast to other commonly used groundwater modeling methods, e.g. the finite elements or finite different method, the AEM does not discrete the model domain into cells. This gives the advantage that the model is valid for any given point in the model domain. However, it also imposes that the domain is not as easily divided into regions of e.g. different hydraulic conductivity, as when modeling with a cell grid. While there are some solutions that deals with this, e.g. there exist solutions for implementing a vertically varying properties or structures in an aquifer in an AEM model.

Artist's conception of two DBS wires/electrodes in the human brain Enlarged artist's conception of two DBS wires/electrodes with multiple contact points in each wire Wirehead is a term first used in works of science fiction to refer to various kinds of interaction between human beings and technology, or to a person who makes use of such technology. In its most common usage, the \\"wirehead\\" concept refers to technologies involving electrical wiring that is implanted in or otherwise connected to a human brain and used to deliver safe amounts of electricity either to the whole brain or to more specific areas of the brain, often the so-called \\"pleasure centers\\" or reward circuitry.\\"THE PLEASURE CENTRES\\" McGill University Though the concept of \\"wireheading\\" originated in science fiction, electrical brain stimulation and related technologies have long been studied in neuroscience and psychiatry and are routinely used in therapeutic and research settings. Usage of the science fiction term has since expanded to include these real-world applications. In fiction=Literature= In Larry Niven's Known Space stories, a \\"wirehead\\" is someone who has been fitted with an electronic brain implant known as a \\"droud\\" in order to stimulate the pleasure centers of their brain. Wireheading is the most addictive habit known (Louis Wu is the only given example of a recovered addict), and wireheads usually die from neglecting their basic needs in favour of the ceaseless pleasure. Wireheading is so powerful and easy that it becomes an evolutionary pressure, selecting against that portion of humanity without self-control. A wirehead's death is central to Niven's Gil \\"the Arm\\" Hamilton story \\"Death by Ecstasy\\", published by Galaxy Magazine in 1969, and a main character in the book Ringworld Engineers is a former wirehead trying to quit. Also in the Known Space universe, a device called a \\"tasp\\" which does not need a surgical implant (similar to transcranial magnetic stimulation) can be used to achieve similar goals: the pleasure center of a person's brain is found and remotely stimulated (considered a violation without seeking the person's consent beforehand). It is an important device in Niven's Ringworld novels. Niven's stories explain wireheads by mentioning a study in which experimental rats had electrodes implanted at strategic locations in their brains, so that an applied current would induce a pleasant feeling. If the current could be obtained any time the rats pushed the lever, they would use it over and over, ignoring food and physical necessities until they died. Such experiments were actually conducted by James Olds and Peter Milner in the 1950s, first discovering the locations of such areas, and later showing the extremes to which rats would go to obtain the stimulus again. Mindkiller, a 1982 sci-fi novel by Spider Robinson set in the late 1980s, explores the social implications of technologies that manipulate the brain, beginning with wireheading, the use of electric current to stimulate the pleasure center of the brain in order to achieve a narcotic high. In the Shaper/Mechanist stories by Bruce Sterling, \\"wirehead\\" is the Mechanist term for a human who has given up corporeal existence and become a computer simulation. In The Terminal Man (1972) by Michael Crichton, forty electrodes are implanted into the brain of the character Harold Franklin \\"Harry\\" Benson to control his seizures. However, his pleasure center is also stimulated, and his body begins producing more seizures in order to receive the pleasurable sensation. =Film and television= In the 1983 film Brainstorm, a wireless brain connection machine is made. A character named Hal Abramson abuses the device with a signal of neverending sexual pleasure. In season three, episode 10, \\"Awakening\\" of the television series The Outer Limits, a neurologically impaired woman receives a brain implant to help her become more like a typical human. In episode 41, \\"Zone Dancer\\" of the 1986 animated series The Centurions, the lead character Crystal Kane is accused of \\"Zone Dancing\\" (the series' term for computer hacking) and seen using a \\"droud\\" to interface her brain with computer networks in what is probably the first animated representation of cyberspace and virtual reality. The story, written by Michael Reaves, weaves a future noir tale of cyberpunk espionage, cloning, and private-eye procedural, all set in the universe of the animated series and makes copious references to William Gibson's Neuromancer. There is even a Zone Dancer named Gibson and, in what may be an homage to Larry Niven's Louis Wu, a cyberneticist named Dr. Wu. The title character of the television series House is a physician who suffers from chronic pain. In the episode \\"Half-Wit\\", House seeks a medical procedure to stimulate the \\"pleasure center\\" of his brain. Real-world examples Though electrical brain stimulation is exaggerated to its logical extremity in science fiction tropes such as wireheading, the technology and its application for medical purposes do indeed exist in the real world. The application of electricity to the brains of animals in order to study brain function has been practiced for nearly a century. In 1924, Hans Berger succeeded in recording the first human electroencephalogram (EEG). William Grey Walter wrote a paper in 1938 on the applications of electro-encephalography, the measurement of electrical activity in the brain using wires of different types. Wilder Penfield and Herbert Jasper used electrical stimulation of the human brain to find the places where their patients' seizures were coming from.\\"Stimulation of the human cortex and the experience of pain: Wilder Penfield's observations revisited\\" Laure Mazzola, Jean Isnard, Roland Peyron, Fran√ßois Maugui√®re .

He served as the dean of St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in the United States until June 30, 1992. Life=Early life= Meyendorff was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, into the √©migr√© Russian nobility as Ivan Feofilovich Meyendorf (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –§–µ–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ú–µ–π–µ–Ω–¥–æ—Ä—Ñ). He was the grandson of Baron General Feofil Egorovich Meyendorff. Meyendorff completed his secondary education in France and his theological education at the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris in 1949. In 1948, he also received a licentiate at the Sorbonne, and later earned a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sup√©rieures (1949) and a Dipl√¥me de l'√©cole pratique des Hautes Etudes (1954). He earned the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1958 with a groundbreaking doctoral thesis on the teachings of St. Gregory Palamas. =Theological career= In France, Meyendorff was an Assistant Professor of Church History at the St. Sergius Institute, and a Fellow at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. After his ordination to the priesthood in the Orthodox Church in 1959, Meyendorff and his family moved to the United States. There he joined the faculty of Saint Vladimir's Seminary, located in Tuckahoe, New York, as a Professor of Church History and Patristics. Additionally, he held successive joint appointments as a lecturer in Byzantine theology at Harvard University, Dumbarton Oaks (to which he returned for a semester as Acting Director of Studies in 1977), and as Professor of Byzantine History at Fordham University (from 1967). He also was Adjunct Professor at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary, both in New York City, and lectured widely on university campuses and at church events. He held the position of Dean of St. Vladimir's Seminary from March 1984 until June 1992. Meyendorff was a major voice in the Orthodox community and worked for the reunion of the three splinter groups into which the Russian Orthodox Church broke up after the Russian Revolution. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Orthodox Church in America as an independent entity in 1970, and urged the various Orthodox Churches in the United States, which were ethnically based, to grow closer together in their shared faith. He frequently represented the Orthodox tradition in ecumenical gatherings, such as the Uppsala Assembly held in 1968 by the World Council of Churches, during his tenure as Chairman of its Commission on Faith and Order (1967-1975). =Death and legacy= While on vacation at the family's summer home in Quebec following his resignation, Meyendorff took ill and was taken to St. Mary's Hospital in Montreal. He died there on 22 July as the result of pancreatic cancer. His son, Paul Meyendorff (born 1950), is currently Professor of Liturgical Theology at St. Vladimir's Seminary. Publications and courses Meyendorff's publications include the critical text and translation of Byzantine theologian Gregory Palamas (1959), as well as a number of books in the fields of theology and history, such as A Study of Gregory Palamas (French ed., 1959; Engl. 1964); The Orthodox Church (1963); Orthodoxy and Catholicity (1966); Christ in Eastern Christian Thought (1969); Byzantine Theology (1973); Marriage, an Orthodox Perspective (1975); Living Tradition (1978); Byzantium and the Rise of Russia (1980); The Byzantine Legacy in the Orthodox Church (1981); Catholicity and the Church (1983); and Imperial unity and Christian divisions. The Church 450-680 A.D. (1989); Rome, Constantinople, Moscow: Historical and Theological Studies (1996). His books have been published in a number of languages, including French, German, Italian, Russian, Greek, English, Finnish, Spanish, Dutch, Korean, Japanese, Serbian, Romanian, Polish, Hungarian and Chinese. Study of Gregory Palamas Meyendorff's doctoral dissertation on Palamas is considered to have transformed the opinion of the Western Church regarding Palamism. Before his study of Palamas, Palamite theology was considered to be a \\"curious and sui generis example of medieval Byzantium's intellectual decline.\\" Meyendorff's landmark study of Palamas however, \\"set Palamas firmly within the context of Greek patristic thought and spirituality\\" with the result that Palamism is now generally understood to be \\"a faithful witness to the long-standing Eastern Christian emphasis on deification (theosis) as the purpose of the divine economy in Christ.\\" Affiliations A member of several professional associations, Meyendorff served during different periods as President of the Orthodox Theological Society of America, President of the American Patristic Association, and a member of the Executive Committee, U.S. Committee for Byzantine Studies. He was a Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities (1976‚Äì77), and a Guggenheim Fellow (1981). During his service at the seminary, he held the positions of librarian, director of studies, and was long-time editor of St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly. His service to the church included positions as chairman of the Department of External Affairs of the Orthodox Church in America, as advisor to the Holy Synod, and as editor of the monthly newspaper The Orthodox Church. As a representative of the Orthodox Church, he participated in the activities of the World Council of Churches, having been Chairman of the Commission on Faith and Order (1967‚Äì75) and a member of the Central Committee. Committed particularly to inter-Orthodox unity and cooperation, he was one of the founders and the first general secretary of Syndesmos (World Fellowship of Orthodox Youth Organizations), and served later as its president. Awards Meyendorff held honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame and General Theological Seminary, and was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. Meyendorff was a Senior Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks. The Diploma of Honorary Member of the Leningrad Theological Academy was bestowed upon Fr John in May 1990. In June 1991, Fr John was awarded the Order of St Vladimir, 2nd Class, by Aleksy II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. International Conference From 9‚Äì11 February 2012, an International Conference \\"The Legacy of Fr John Meyendorff, Scholar and Churchman (1926-1992)\\" was held at the St. Sergius Institute in Paris, to honour the 20th anniversary of the passing away of Protopresbyter John Meyendorff.

It was named from the meaning \\"abode of love\\". The Agapemone community was founded by the Reverend Henry Prince in Spaxton, Somerset. The sect also built a church in Upper Clapton, London, and briefly had bases in Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk, Brighton and Weymouth. The ideas of the community were based on the theories of various German religious mystics and its primary object was the spiritualisation of the matrimonial state. The Church of England had dismissed Prince earlier in his career for his radical teachings. The Agapemonites predicted the imminent return of Jesus Christ. According to newspaper accounts, Prince's successor, John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, declared himself Jesus Christ reincarnate. The Agapemone community consisted mostly of wealthy unmarried women. Both Prince and Smyth-Pigott took many spiritual brides. Later investigations have shown that these \\"brides\\" were not solely spiritual and that some produced illegitimate children. In 1860, Prince lost a lawsuit brought on behalf of Louisa Nottidge by the Nottidge family and the group vanished from the public eye. It finally closed in 1956 when the last member died. Henry James Prince Henry Prince (1811‚Äì1899) Henry James Prince (1811‚Äì1899) studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, obtained his qualifications in 1832 and was appointed medical officer to the General Hospital in Bath, his native city. Compelled by ill health to abandon his profession, he entered himself in 1837 as a student at St David's College, Lampeter (now the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), where he gathered about him a band of earnest religious enthusiasts known as the Lampeter Brethren. The vice principal of the college contacted the Bishop of Bath and Wells who, in 1846, installed Prince as the curate of Charlinch in Somerset, where he had sole charge during the illness and absence of the rector, Samuel Starkey. Attendances at the church were small until, during one of the services, Prince acted as if he was possessed, throwing himself around the church. Congregations grew each week as the \\"possession\\" was repeated. The congregation was then divided with separate services for men and women. Subsequently, he separated them again into sinners and the righteous, the latter of which generally included females who were wealthy. The bishop was summoned to investigate the practices. By that time, Prince had contracted his first \\"spiritual marriage\\" and had persuaded himself that he had been absorbed into the personality of God and become a visible embodiment of the Holy Spirit. During his illness, Reverend Starkey read one of his curate's sermons, and was not only \\"cured\\" forthwith, but embraced his strange doctrines. Together they procured many conversions in the countryside and the neighbouring towns. In the end the rector was deprived of his living and Prince was defrocked. Together with a few disciples they started the Charlinch Free Church, which had a very brief existence, meeting in a supportive farmer's barn. Prince used money inherited on the death of his first wife, Martha, to marry Julia Starkey, the sister of the rector. They all moved to Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk where Prince started again to build a congregation, which grew over the subsequent one to two years. The Bishop of Ely then expelled them. Prince opened Adullam Chapel, which was also known as Cave Adullam, in the North Laine area of Brighton. Meanwhile, Starkey established himself at Weymouth. Their chief success lay in the latter town, and Prince soon moved there. Followers A number of followers, estimated by Prince at 500 but by his critics at one fifth of the number, were gathered together, and it was given out by \\"Beloved\\" or \\"The Lamb\\" (the names by which the Agapemonites designated their leader) that his disciples must divest themselves of their possessions and throw them into the common stock. This was done, even by the poor, all of whom looked forward to the speedy end of the present dispensation and were content, for the short remainder of this world, to live in common and, while not repudiating earthly ties, to treat them as purely spiritual. With the money thus obtained the house at Spaxton that was to become the \\"Abode of Love\\" was enlarged and furnished luxuriously, and the three Nottidge sisters, who contributed ¬£6,000 each, were immediately married to three of Prince's nearest disciples. Agnes, the eldest of the Nottidge sisters, objected to the spiritual marriage which entailed a celibate life and, as one writer reports, became pregnant by another member of the community; however, it is unlikely that she committed adultery because her husband never accused her, and she later gained sole custody of their child in 1850 after proving herself of good moral character before a court. Agnes wrote to her younger sister Louisa warning her not to come to Spaxton. Despite this Louisa travelled to Somerset to join them. Her mother Emily feared the spiritual and financial influence that Prince had established over her daughters. Emily instructed her son Edmund, her nephew Edward Nottidge, and her son-in-law, Frederick Ripley, to travel down to Somerset and to rescue her unmarried daughter, Louisa after her arrival. The three men succeeded in removing Louisa against her will in November 1846, and imprisoned her in 12 Woburn Place, a villa by Regents Park.Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849), reported in The Times: June 25‚Äì27, 1849 Following Louisa's persistent claims regarding the divinity of Henry Prince, her mother enlisted medical aid and had Louisa certified insane and then placed her in Moorcroft House Asylum, Hillingdon. Her treatment and forced incarceration in the asylum have remained of interest with respect to the rights of psychiatric patients; Dr Arthur Stillwell, the presiding physician, made notes on Louisa's condition and treatment, recorded in The Lancet. Louisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square, but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. In 1860 Louisa's brother, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that Louisa had given him as a result of his undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860). The Nottidges won the case, with costs. After the cases were resolved Louisa Nottidge returned to Spaxton and spent the rest of her life as one of the Agapemonites. In 1856, a few years after the establishment of the ‚ÄúAbode of Love‚Äù, Prince and Zoe Patterson, one of his virginal female followers, engaged in public ceremonial sexual intercourse on a billiard table in front of a large audience. The scandal led to the secession of some of his most faithful friends, who were unable any longer to endure what they regarded as the amazing mixture of blasphemy and immorality offered for their acceptance. The most prominent of those who remained received such titles as the \\"Anointed Ones\\", the \\"Angel of the Last Trumpet\\", the \\"Seven Witnesses\\" and so forth. Spaxton The Agapemone Chapel in Spaxton (2010). Extensive building work was undertaken to accommodate members and followers at Four Forks in Spaxton, to which Prince and his followers moved in the summer of 1846. Behind high walls were built a 20-bedroom house and attached chapel, as well as a gazebo, stables, and cottages, all set within landscaped gardens. The buildings were designed by William Cobbe. The buttressed chapel, with its pinnacles and stained glass, was completed in 1845; today, together with the attached house, it is a Grade II listed building. In 1899, Prince died at the age of 88. His followers buried Prince in the grounds of the chapel, with his coffin positioned vertically so that he would be standing on the day of his resurrection. In the early 20th century, a number of houses (some in the Arts and Crafts style) were built at Four Forks by members of the Agapemonites, including Joseph Morris and his daughter Violet. Since closure of the community, the chapel has been used as a studio for the production of children's television programmes, including Trumpton and Camberwick Green. The complex of buildings became known as Barford Gables and was put on the market in 1997. The chapel received planning permission for conversion into a residential house and was put on the market again in 2004. Upper Clapton Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites built the Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was designed by Joseph Morris (and his sons and daughters, some of whom lived with the sect) in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956, used by a splinter group, and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church. John Hugh Smyth- Pigott After Prince died in 1899 he was replaced by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Life. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime. John Hugh Smyth-Pigott continued his claimant of divinity both during and after the death of Mirza Gulam Ahmad. The house which may have belonged to Smyth-Pigott in St John's Wood was visited by John Betjeman in his film Metro-land. It is built in the neo-gothic style. It is currently the home of the television presenter Vanessa Feltz and was previously the home of Charles Saatchi. Smyth-Pigott died in 1927 and the sect gradually declined until the last member, Ruth, died in 1956. Her funeral in 1956 was the only time when outsiders were admitted to the chapel. Smyth- Pigott's grand daughter, Margaret Campbell, recalled that her grandmother (Ruth Preece) had warned her that there were many stories made up about Smyth- Pigott but that he was a 'good man'. Campbell argued that Smyth-Pigott, or Beloved as he was known, did not have affairs although he did have two bigamous wives. She claimed that both wives were happy with the arrangement (one being older and unable to have children) and that the sect had to be viewed as of its time, emerging shortly after religious emancipation in the 1830s. It allowed many rich women an alternative lifestyle to their other options of governess or wife and they lived in luxury at the Agapemone in Somerset until their death. She recalled growing up at the cult as a very happy experience in an interview to the Henley Standard in 2016, shortly before her death. Campbell argued that Beloved had once given a sermon in which he said, 'Christ is no longer here (pointing skywards) but here (pointing to his chest),' thereby expounding the central Christian doctrine of Christ within every Christian and that this had been twisted by the media for their own aims. Kate Barlow deftly dispels rumours of a 'revolving stage of virgins' as described by one newspaper at the time as myth in her memoir 'The Abode of Love' and details many interesting aspects of the cult such as its own signature tea served at 4pm every day.Kate Barlow, 'The Abode of Love' Books about the sect The Abode of Love by Aubrey Menen ‚Äì \\"an appallingly inaccurate popular account\\" according to one review ‚Äì is a novelisation of the history of the Agapemonites under Prince's leadership.

The adult Ayrshire cow weighs from . Ayrshires typically have red and white markings; the red can range from a shade of orange to a dark brown. They are known for their hardiness and their ability to convert grass into milk efficiently. The breed's strengths today are traits of easy calving and longevity. Origins. It is generally accepted that the breed originated in Ayrshire. However, Richard Feachem an acknowledged authority on the history of Scotland writes in his book (The North Britons - Hutchinson, 1965) \\"...a tradition which has lately been crowned with success by development of the Ayreshire breed;...foreigners admittedly to the country of their adoption...\\"  Etymology  The breed originated in the county of Ayrshire in Scotland before 1800. During the breed's development, it was referred to as the Dunlop, later the Cunningham, and finally, the Ayrshire. These are all parts of the County Ayr. Which strains of cattle were crossbred to create the Ayrshire is not known.  History  Although they are now native to Ayrshire, Scotland, many cattle historians believe the Ayrshire breed originated in Holland. In 1750, they were crossbred with other breeds of cattle, which led to their distinctive brown spots. The cattle were recognised as a distinct breed by the Highland and Agricultural Society in 1814. Many modern dairy farmers favour Ayrshires because of their longevity, hardiness, and easy calving. These traits are thought to have developed due to the rugged conditions of its native habitat. Ayrshire cattle were first brought to the United States in 1822, primarily to Connecticut and other parts of New England. The environment was similar to their native land of Scotland. The American Ayrshire Breed Association was founded in 1875. The Approved Ayrshire Milk programme, which licensed farms that owned Ayrshire cattle, began in the 1930s. Ayrshire milk was identified as being of higher quality compared to that of other breeds. Today, the cattle are owned by farmers in many areas of America, including New York and Pennsylvania.  Characteristics  The head of an Ayrshire cow The Ayrshire is considered to be a medium-sized breed by most conservation organisations and breed associations. The average adult individual \\"should weigh over at maturity.\\" Their milk production can reach or greater per annum. Ayrshire cattle are usually red and white in colour. The red colour can vary from very deep to a lighter shade; according to the U.S. Ayrshire Breeders' Association, \\"[t]here is no discrimination or registry restriction on color patterns for Ayrshires.\\" Calves are normally dehorned to reduce injuries to other cattle and human handlers. If they are not polled, their horns can grow up to in length. Due to the environment of their native Scottish lowlands, they are typically strong and adaptable to many farming methods. Compared to other dairy breeds, such as the Holstein-Friesian, Ayrshires are usually able to survive despite less feed and less fertile ground. =Temperament= A study of the social behaviour of Polish Black-and-White dairy cattle and their F1-crossbreds with Ayrshire, Jersey, Holstein-Friesian and Swedish Black-and- White breeds, found the Ayrshire crossbreeds were most dominant, least attacked by their group-mates and least susceptible to a group change. A further study found that among Ayrshire, Holstein, Jersey, Brown Swiss and Guernsey (the other common dairy breeds), the Ayrshire had the highest number of agonistic interactions, however, this was not related to bodyweight.  Population  In 2008, 63,356 Ayrshire cattle were registered in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Ayrshire cattle are classed as a \\"recovering\\" breed by the Livestock Conservancy, despite a significant decline in registrations over the last 30 years. This means more than 2,500 registrations occur annually, but the breed is \\"still in need of monitoring.\\"  References  External links  * U.S. Ayrshire Breeders Association * Ayrshire Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland Category:Dairy cattle breeds Category:Cattle breeds originating in Scotland Category:Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy ","title":"Ayrshire cattle"},{"id":"2289285","text":"Sheila Margaret MacRae (n√©e Stevens; 24 September 1921 ‚Äì 6 March 2014) was an English-born American actress, singer, and dancer.

Imprints include: Black Cat, Evergreen, Venus Library, and Zebra. Barney Rosset purchased the company in 1951 and turned it into an alternative book press in the United States. He partnered with Richard Seaver to bring French literature to the United States. The Atlantic Monthly Press, under the aegis of its publisher, Morgan Entrekin, merged with Grove Press in 1991. Grove later became an imprint of the publisher Grove/Atlantic, Inc. Early years Grove Press was founded in 1947 in Greenwich Village on Grove Street. The original owners only published three books in three years and so sold it to Barney Rosset in 1951 for three thousand dollars. Literary avant-garde Under Rosset's leadership, Grove introduced American readers to European avant-garde literature and theatre, including French authors Alain Robbe- Grillet, Jean Genet, and Eug√®ne Ionesco. In 1954 Grove published Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot after it had been refused by more mainstream publishers. Since then Grove has been Beckett's U.S. publisher. Grove is also the U.S. publisher of the works of Harold Pinter; in 2006 it published a collection called The Essential Pinter, which includes Pinter's Nobel Lecture, entitled \\"Art, Truth & Politics\\".In 2006 Grove published an anniversary bilingual edition of Waiting for Godot and a special four-volume edition of Beckett's works, with commissioned introductions by Edward Albee, J. M. Coetzee, Salman Rushdie, and Colm T√≥ib√≠n, to commemorate his centenary (April 2006). Grove was also the first American house to publish the unabridged complete works of the Marquis de Sade, translated by Seaver and Austryn Wainhouse. Grove also had an interest in Japanese literature, publishing several anthologies as well as works by Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe and others. Grove published most of the American Beats of the 1950s (Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Allen Ginsberg) as well as poets like Frank O'Hara of the New York School and poets associated with Black Mountain and the San Francisco Renaissance such as Robert Duncan. In 1963, Grove published My Life and Loves: Five Volumes in One/Complete and Unexpurgated, with annotations, collecting Frank Harris' work in one volume for the first time. From 1957 to 1973 Grove published Evergreen Review, a literary magazine whose contributors included Edward Albee, Bertolt Brecht, William S. Burroughs, Albert Camus, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nat Hentoff, LeRoi Jones, John Lahr, and Timothy Leary. Grove has also from time to time published mainstream works. For example, in 1978 it published the script from the George Lucas film American Graffiti under its Black Cat paperback imprint. Political works The defining movements of the 1960s in America‚Äîthe antiwar, civil rights, black power, counterculture, and student movements in the United States‚Äîalong with revolutions across the globe, were debated, exposed, and discussed in Grove‚Äôs publications as was the sexual revolution. Grove‚Äôs books challenged prevailing attitudes about sex through dozens of erotic books, many by \\"anonymous\\" authors; introduced the layperson to new directions in psychology through Eric Berne‚Äôs Games People Play; and gave voice to revolutionaries around the world, including Che Guevara and Malcolm X. They published works by Frantz Fanon and R√©gis Debray, and numerous books opposing the Vietnam war and the draft, including information on G.I. rights.Grove Press Records, Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center Censorship and obscenity battles Rejecting conventional notions of obscenity and morality, Grove gained a reputation as a controversial publisher committed to fighting censorship as it published some of the most well-known banned books. In 1959, Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of D.H. Lawrence‚Äôs Lady Chatterley's Lover. The U.S. Post Office Department confiscated copies sent through the mail. Rosset sued the New York city postmaster and his Lawyer Charles Rembar won in New York, and then on federal appeal. Grove‚Äôs success in publishing Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover paved the way for Rosset to publish another contested work that was ultimately cleared by the courts, Henry Miller's 1934 novel, Tropic of Cancer. The book contained explicit sexual passages and therefore could not be published in the United States. In 1961, Grove Press issued a copy of the work and lawsuits were brought against dozens of individual booksellers in many states for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the U. S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Miller v. California. (The Miller of the Miller case was unrelated to Henry Miller.) The William S. Burroughs novel Naked Lunch was banned in some parts of the world for approximately ten years. The first American publisher was Grove Press. The book was banned by Boston courts in 1962 due to obscenity, but that decision was reversed in a landmark 1966 opinion by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. This was the last major literary censorship battle in the US. Upon publication, Grove Press added to the book supplementary material regarding the censorship battle as well as an article written by Burroughs on the topic of drug addiction. Grove would publish several editions of the novel over the next four decades, including a \\"Restored Text\\" version in 2002. Grove also published the first American paperback editions of other Burroughs works including The Soft Machine, Nova Express and The Ticket That Exploded. Grove would also publish the final collection of the author's writings, the posthumously published Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs, and in 2008 published the American first edition of And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, the first release of a novel that Burroughs and Jack Kerouac had collaborated on in the mid-1940s. Grove had to defend its Evergreen Review on several occasions due to what was deemed objectionable content. Issues were occasionally seized by the authorities. After winning several battles over the printed page, Grove built on these victories and successfully defended the screening of Vilgot Sj√∂man‚Äôs Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow). Union conflicts In 1962, Grove had sales of $2 million, but after legal bills, lost $400,000. But by 1964, they were profitable, and by 1967, Grove went public and built its own headquarters. In 1970, the staff of 150 began organizing a union. Rosset fired some of the organizers (and later re-hired them in arbitration). The organizers responded with a picket line and an occupation of the building. Rosset called the police, and the occupiers left. His editor, Richard Seaver, talked to the pickets and convinced them to disperse. Grove distributed an anti-union information sheet, and the union vote failed, 86‚Äì34. After the vote, Grove fired half its workers.  1980s  In 1985 Rosset sold Grove Press to Ann Getty, Getty Oil, and Sir George Weidenfeld, a British Publisher. Rosset was fired a year later.

The caterpillars spin silk, which they then use to capture and eat snails. These are the first caterpillars known to eat snails (or mollusks of any kind). Some species are amphibious.

He started singing while in primary school in Taita. He went on to Government African School, in Pumwani in Nairobi. He then dropped out of Shimo la Tewa Secondary School, where he had joined Form Three, to pursue a musical career. It was while at Pumwani, he said in an interview, that he fell in love with a beautiful girl, \\"an angel,\\" to whom he composed and recorded Malaika (Angel) to console her when she was given away to an older man who could pay a bride price. Malaika was recorded at the Equator Sound Studios under the guidance of Charles Worrod, who went on to promote and distribute the ballad.

It includes contributions from talk radio personality Andrew Wilkow and former Misfits singer and Gotham Road frontman Michale Graves.

He batted and threw left-handed. A native of Springfield, Missouri, Long turned down an offer from the Green Bay Packers to play football, opting instead to play baseball. Career Long spent six seasons in the minor leagues, playing for five different organizations before he debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1951, ending that season with the St. Louis Browns. After three and one-half additional seasons in the minors, Pittsburgh gave Long another chance. He hit .291 with 79 RBIs, while collecting double-figure totals in extra-base hits with 19 doubles, 13 triples, and 16 home runs. In fact, Long led the major leagues in triples (13) in that 1955 season. Long, circa 1956 In 1956, Long posted career highs in home runs (27) and RBI (91), made the National League All-Star team, and put his name in the record books by hitting eight home runs in eight consecutive games between May 19 and May 28, breaking the previous mark of six straight games, shared by Ken Williams (1922), George Kelly (1924), Lou Gehrig (1931), Walker Cooper (1947) and Willie Mays (1955).United Press. \\"Pirates Trip Phils, 8-5, as Long Hits Homer in 6th Came in Row: His Four-Bagger Ties Major League Record Shared by Five Other Players\\".

Since then, the mark has been matched only by Don Mattingly (1987) and Ken Griffey, Jr. (1993), both in the American League. Traded to the Chicago Cubs in May 1957, Long belted 55 homers for them in two and a half seasons. In 1958 he became the first left-handed-throwing catcher since Jiggs Donahue in 1902. Long performed this feat in a pair of Cubs losses at Wrigley Field, during the first game of a doubleheader versus the Pirates on August 20 and on September 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In both cases, he had been shifted from first base in the ninth inning.Pittsburgh Pirates 4, Chicago Cubs 2 (first game of doubleheader); Wednesday, August 20, 1958 at Wrigley Field (box score) RetrosheetLos Angeles Dodgers 2, Chicago Cubs 1; Sunday, September 21, 1958 at Wrigley Field (box score) Retrosheet In 1959 he tied another home run record, when he hit back-to-back pinch-hit homers. In 1960 Long divided his playing time between the San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees. As a member of the Yankees, he faced his former Pirates team in the 1960 World Series. Long played for the Washington Senators during 1961 and 1962, but was also on the Yankees team that won the 1962 World Series over the Giants. He finished his playing career in 1963. Following his retirement, Long served as a Yankee coach and later as an umpire in minor league baseball. In a 10-season MLB career, Long was a .267 hitter with 805 hits, 132 home runs and 467 RBI in 1,013 games. He recorded a .988 fielding percentage as a first baseman. Dale Long died in Palm Coast, Florida at age 64 after a long battle with cancer.

Description The enfield has the head of a fox, forelegs like an eagle's talons, the chest of a greyhound, the body of a lion, and the hindquarters and tail of a wolf. O'Kelly The earliest known example of the enfield is the crest of the √ì Cellaigh clan of Ireland. √ì Cellaigh of U√≠ Maine are the most documented O'Kelly sept in early Irish history and annals. The enfield appears in Leabhar Ua Maine. The ancient tradition among the O'Kellys is that they have borne this fabulous animal since the days of King Tadhg M√≥r Ua Cellaigh who fell \\"fighting like a wolf dog\\" on the side of the High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. When Tadhg Mor fell this mythical beast issued from the nearby sea to protect the dead body of the chief until it was retrieved for proper burial by his kinsmen. The animal is sculptured on many old (-1650) tombstones of the O'Kelly family in the Abbey of Kilconnell (founded ca. 1353 by King William Buidhe √ì Cellaigh), and in the old church of Cloonkeen. In 1859, an excavation project found a bronze 15th century O'Kelly seal 20 ft deep in a bog, prompting considerable research on the origins of the O'Kelly enfield on the seal: Modern uses The beast was on the coat of arms of the Municipal Borough of Enfield, which was amalgamated with the Municipal Borough of Edmonton and the Municipal Borough of Southgate to form the London Borough of Enfield. It is unclear whether the beast has any historic connection with the town, but it still makes a striking example of canting arms. It is used on the logo and the modern coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield and as an emblem by some organisations there: for example, on the badges of Enfield County School, Chace Community School, Enfield Ignatians R.F.C. and of the football clubs Enfield (1893) F.C. and Enfield Town F.C., as well as Oneida FC. In Australia, it was used in the crest of the former City of Enfield, South Australia (which was named after the London borough), and is still used by the Enfield Brass Band. It is also used as the centrepiece of the squadron crest of 38 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force, in Queensland.

Among other things the Church of England spread around the world and, gradually developing autonomy in each region of the world, became the communion as it exists today.  Origins  St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin in Dublin. The only provinces of the Anglican Communion with a direct and unbroken history stretching back to the pre-Reformation church are to be found in Great Britain and Ireland: the Church of England, the Church in Wales, the Church of Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church. As its name suggests, the Scottish situation is unique; the national Church of Scotland is Presbyterian and for some years in the late 17th and early 18th centuries the Scottish Episcopal Church, despite its similarities to the Church of England, was regarded with some suspicion because of its occasional associations with Jacobite opposition to the House of Hanover. Although Henry VIII broke with the Church of Rome in the 1530s, he strongly resisted thereafter associating the English Church with the Continental Protestant Reformation. Henry's position was however, reversed in the brief reign of his young son Edward VI 1547‚Äì1553, when the leaders of the Church of England, especially Thomas Cranmer, actively sought to establish England in the centre of evolving Reformed churches. Cranmer's ambitions, however, were not widely shared amongst the bulk of laity and clergy; and accordingly, the return to the religious forms of traditional Roman Catholicism under Queen Mary was widely welcomed. The Elizabethan Settlement in England was broken in 1570 with the excommunication of Elizabeth. Although few, if any, concessions were made to the Papacy or to Roman Catholic doctrine, a small number of changes were then made to the Articles of Religion and to the Prayer Book, especially in relation the Real Presence and to the continuation of worship in more traditional forms. Only one of Mary's English and Welsh bishops conformed to the Elizabethan settlement, though all save 300 of the parish clergy subscribed. In Ireland the position was reversed; all bishops save two accepted the Elizabethan Settlement, but the bulk of parish clergy and laity remained loyal to the pope. In the period since 1553, Continental Reformed Protestantism had itself continued to develop, especially in Geneva and Heidelberg, but English divines who wished the Elizabethan church to take part in these developments were to be bitterly disappointed; Elizabeth refused any further change to the forms or structures of religion established in 1559. In particular, Protestant controversialists began to attack the episcopal polity, and the defined liturgy of the Elizabethan Church as incompatible with the true Reformed tradition; and, in response, defenders of the established church began, from the early 17th Century onwards, to claim these specific features as positively desirable, or indeed essential. The attempt to impose in Scotland a Prayer Book on the English model, drove the three kingdoms into civil war. However, the Puritan sympathies of the victorious Parliamentary armies in the English Civil War, and the consequential abolition during the Commonwealth of English bishoprics and cathedral chapters with the suppression of the Book of Common Prayer, resulted in English churchmen beginning to recognise Anglican identity as being distinct from and incompatible with the traditions of Presbyterian Protestantism. This distinction was formalised at the Restoration of Charles II, when the proposals of Puritan divines for further reform of the Prayer Book were thoroughly rejected; and 1,760 clergymen were deprived of their livings for failing to subscribe to the 1662 Book. From this date onwards dissenting Protestant congregations were to be found throughout England, and the established church no longer claimed or sought to comprehend all traditions of Protestant belief. In Ireland and in many of England's American Colonies, the numbers who subscribed to Presbyterian congregations formed the majority of the Protestant population; while in Scotland from 1689, following the accession of William and Mary, Presbyterian church polity was revived, and constituted in that kingdom, the established church; so that those ministers and congregations who continued to subscribe to the Anglican Episcopalian traditions eventually became a dissenting minority. In the 18th and 19th centuries, divines of the Church of England increasingly differentiated their faith from that of the Protestant churches. Controversy broke out into the open after 1829, with the removal of religious restrictions on political rights in the United Kingdom, following which elected members of the UK Parliament (the legal authority in England for definitions of religious faith), might include both Roman Catholics and Dissenters. The Tractarians undertook a re-examination of Anglican traditions of the 19th century; developing these into the general principle that Anglicanism represented a via media between Protestantism and Catholicism; or otherwise, that the Church of England together with the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, represented three 'branches' of the Universal Church, whose faith derived from Scripture and Tradition independent of legislative formulae. The issue was more pressing insofar as Anglican societies were engaging actively in missionary work, often in conjunction with Christians of other traditions; resulting in the foundation of new churches, especially in Africa. Anglican traditions implied an expectation that these churches should develop self- government and a locally based episcopacy; but it was unclear who had legal power to create such bishoprics, who had the authority to appoint to them, and what discretion such bishops would have to define local statements of faith and forms of worship. Matters came to a head with the case of John William Colenso appointed to the Bishopric of Natal in 1853. When Bishop Colenso published commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans and on the Pentateuch that questioned traditional teachings, he was deprived of his see by the bishops of the South African church in 1863; but then re-instated on appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1866. Whatever the merits of the Colenso case, the implied action of a British court in constraining matters of faith and discipline in a church outside the United Kingdom was instrumental in the decision to summon the first Lambeth Conference in 1867. As Britain's worldwide colonial empire grew, the Church of England began to spread with it. But at first no bishops were sent overseas; all colonial churches reported back to the Bishop of London. At the time of the American Revolution, there had already been considerable American demand for a local bishop; and after that event the Church of England in the new United States certainly needed to organize itself on a local basis.  Anglicanism in the colonies  The first Anglican service in North America was conducted in California in 1579 by the chaplain accompanying Sir Francis Drake on his voyage around the globe. The first baptisms were held in Roanoke, North Carolina, by the ill-fated Roanoke colony. The continuous presence of Anglicanism in North America, however, begins in 1607 with the founding of Jamestown, Virginia. By 1700 there were more than 100 Anglican parishes in British colonies on the mainland of North America, the largest number in Virginia and Maryland. The American War for Independence resulted in the formation of the first independent national church in the Anglican tradition. The 1609 wreck of the flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture, resulted in the settlement of Bermuda by the Company. This was made official in 1612 when the town of St. George's, now the oldest surviving English settlement in the New World, was established. It is the location of St. Peter's Church, the oldest-surviving Anglican church outside of the British Isles (Britain and Ireland) and the oldest surviving non-Roman Catholic church in the New World, also established in 1612. It remained part of the Church of England until 1978 when the Anglican Church of Bermuda was formed. The Church of England was the state church in Bermuda and a system of parishes was set up for the religious and political subdivision of the colony (they survive, today, as both civil and religious parishes). The parish of St. John the Baptist in the city of St. John's, Newfoundland (part of the Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador) is the oldest in Canada, founded in 1699 in response to a petition drafted by the Anglican townsfolk of St. John's and sent to the Bishop of London, Henry Compton. In this petition the people also requested help in the rebuilding of their church, which had been destroyed, along with the rest of the city, in 1696 by the French under the command of General Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. On August 12, 1787, Charles Inglis was consecrated Bishop of Nova Scotia with jurisdiction over all the British possessions in North America. In 1793 the see of Quebec was founded; Jamaica and Barbados followed in 1824 and Toronto and Newfoundland in 1839. Meanwhile, the needs of India were met, on the urgent representations in Parliament of William Wilberforce and others, by the consecration of T. F. Middleton as Bishop of Calcutta, with three archdeacons to assist him. In 1829, on the nomination of the Duke of Wellington, William Broughton was sent out to work as the Archdeacon of Australia. The first Anglican church in Latin America, St. John's Cathedral (Belize City), was built in the colony of British Honduras (Belize) in 1812. Soon afterwards, in 1835 and 1837, the sees of Madras and Bombay were founded; whilst in 1836 Broughton himself was consecrated as the first Bishop of Australia. Thus down to 1840 there were but ten colonial bishops; and of these several were so hampered by civil regulations that they were little more than government chaplains in episcopal orders. In April of that year, however, Bishop Blomfield of London published his famous letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, declaring that \\"an episcopal church without a bishop is a contradiction in terms\\" and strenuously advocating a great effort for the extension of the episcopate. The plan was taken up with enthusiasm and, in 1841, the bishops of the United Kingdom met and issued a declaration which inaugurated the Colonial Bishoprics Council. Subsequent declarations in 1872 and 1891 have served both to record progress and to stimulate to new effort. The Diocese of New Zealand was founded in 1841, being endowed by the Church Missionary Society through the council, and George Augustus Selwyn was chosen as the first bishop. Moreover, in many cases bishops have been sent to inaugurate new missions, as in the cases of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, Lebombo, Corea and New Guinea; and the missionary jurisdictions so founded develop in time into dioceses. It was only very gradually that these dioceses acquired legislative independence and a determinate organization. At first, sees were created and bishops were nominated by the crown by means of letters patent; and in some cases an income was assigned out of public funds. Moreover, for many years all bishops were consecrated in England, took the customary \\"oath of due obedience\\" to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and were regarded as his extraterritorial suffragans. But by degrees changes have been made on all these points.  America  In 1783 the parishes of Connecticut elected Samuel Seabury as their bishop and sent him to England for ordination. However John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury at the time, found that he had the authority neither to create new bishops without legislation nor to dispense with the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown which formed part of the ordination ceremony. Seabury then went to Scotland where, free from such legal difficulties, he was ordained in 1784. Eventually, with new legislation in place, the Archbishop of Canterbury was able to consecrate William White and Samuel Provoost as bishops for the new Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in 1787 and James Madison, Bishop of Virginia in 1790. The Protestant Episcopal Church held its first General Convention in 1785, and organized using a system of state conventions in place of dioceses. They adopted a constitution and canons and approved an American version of the Book of Common Prayer in 1789 in Philadelphia. William White, who had served as presiding officer of General Convention in 1785 and 1786, was also elected presiding officer of the 1789 convention. He was the first bishop to preside over the convention. When in a second session of the 1789 convention, Bishop Seabury was seated and the New England churches acceded to the constitution. The bishops then withdrew and Bishop Seabury became the first bishop to preside over a separate House of Bishops. The American church officially adopted the term \\"diocese\\" in 1839 with the formation of a second diocese in the state of New York.  Provincial organization  Local conditions soon made a provincial organization necessary, and it was gradually introduced. The bishop of Calcutta received letters patent as metropolitan of India when the sees of Madras and Bombay were founded; and fresh patents were issued to Bishop Broughton in 1847 and Bishop Gray in 1853, as metropolitans of Australia and South Africa respectively. Similar action was taken in 1858, when Bishop Selwyn became metropolitan of New Zealand; and again in 1860, when, on the petition of the Canadian bishops to the Crown and the colonial legislature for permission to elect a metropolitan, letters patent were issued appointing Bishop Fulford of Montreal to that office. Since then metropolitans have been chosen and provinces formed by regular synodical action, a process greatly encouraged by the resolutions of the Lambeth Conferences on the subject. The constitution of these provinces was not uniform. In some cases, as South Africa, New South Wales, and Queensland, the metropolitan see was fixed. Elsewhere, as in New Zealand, where no single city can claim pre-eminence, the metropolitan is either elected or else is the senior bishop by consecration. Two further developments must be mentioned: * The creation of diocesan and provincial synods, the first diocesan synod to meet being that of New Zealand in 1844, while the formation of a provincial synod was foreshadowed by a conference of Australasian bishops at Sydney in 1850; * Towards the close of the 19th century the title of archbishop began to be assumed by the metropolitans of several provinces. It was first assumed by the metropolitans of Canada and Rupert's Land, at the desire of the Canadian general synod in 1893; and subsequently, in accordance with a resolution of the Lambeth Conference of 1897, it was given by their synods to the bishop of Sydney as metropolitan of New South Wales and to the bishop of Cape Town as metropolitan of South Africa. Civil obstacles have hitherto delayed its adoption by the metropolitan of India.  Freedom from state control  By degrees, also, the colonial churches have been freed from their rather burdensome relations with the state. The Church of the West Indies was disestablished in 1868. Other colonial churches followed suit over the next few decades. In 1857 it was decided, in Regina v. Eton College, that the Crown could not claim the presentation to a living when it had appointed the former incumbent to a colonial bishopric, as it does in the case of an English bishopric. In 1861, after some protest from the crown lawyers, two missionary bishops were consecrated without letters patent for regions outside British territory: C. F. Mackenzie for the Zambezi region and J. C. Patteson for Melanesia, by the metropolitans of Cape Town and New Zealand respectively. In 1863 the privy council declared, in Long v. The Bishop of Cape Town, that \\"the Church of England, in places where there is no church established by law, is in the same situation with any other religious body.\\" In 1865 it adjudged Bishop Gray's letters patent, as metropolitan of Cape Town, to be powerless to enable him \\"to exercise any coercive jurisdiction, or hold any court or tribunal for that purpose,\\" since the Cape colony already possessed legislative institutions when they were issued; and his deposition of Bishop Colenso was declared to be \\"null and void in law\\" (re The Bishop of Natal). With the exception of Colenso the South African bishops forthwith surrendered their patents, and formally accepted Bishop Gray as their metropolitan, an example followed in 1865 in the province of New Zealand. In 1862, when the Diocese of Ontario was formed, the bishop was elected in Canada, and consecrated under a royal mandate, letters patent being by this time entirely discredited. And when, in 1867, a coadjutor was chosen for the bishop of Toronto, an application for a royal mandate produced the reply from the colonial secretary that \\"it was not the part of the Crown to interfere in the creation of a new bishop or bishopric, and not consistent with the dignity of the Crown that he should advise Her Majesty to issue a mandate which would not be worth the paper on which it was written, and which, having been sent out to Canada, might be disregarded in the most complete manner.\\" And at the present day the colonial churches are entirely free in this matter. This, however, is not the case with the Church in India. Here the bishops of sees founded down to 1879 receive a stipend from the revenue (with the exception of the bishop of Ceylon, who no longer does so). They are not only nominated by the crown and consecrated under letters patent, but the appointment is expressly subjected \\"to such power of revocation and recall as is by law vested\\" in the crown; and where additional oversight was necessary for the Church in Tinnevelly, it could only be secured by the consecration of two assistant bishops, who worked under a commission for the Archbishop of Canterbury which was to expire on the death of the bishop of Madras. Since then, however, new sees have been founded which are under no such restrictions.  Autonomy  By degrees, also, the relations of colonial churches to the Archbishop of Canterbury have changed. Until 1855 no colonial bishop was consecrated outside the British Isles, the first instance being Bishop MacDougall of Labuan, consecrated in India under a commission from the Archbishop of Canterbury; and until 1874 it was held to be unlawful for a bishop to be consecrated in England without taking the suffragan's Oath of Due Obedience. This necessity was removed by the Colonial Clergy Act of 1874, which permits the Archbishop of Canterbury at his discretion to dispense with the oath. But the most complete autonomy does not involve isolation. The churches are in full communion with one another and act together in many ways; missionary jurisdictions and dioceses are mapped out by common arrangement and even transferred if it seems advisable; e.g., the Diocese of Honolulu (Hawaii), previously under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was transferred in 1900 to the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on account of political changes. Missionary activity of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America resulted in creation of other provinces of the communion, including Brazil, Mexico, Central America, the Philippines and Japan. In Brazil and Japan the Church of England also had a presence, but the Episcopal Church work was more extensive and the Episcopal Church consecrated the first bishops. Though the See of Canterbury claims no primacy over the Anglican Communion analogous to that exercised over the Roman Catholic Church by the Pope, it is regarded with a strong affection and deference, which shows itself by frequent consultation and interchange of greetings. By this the Archbishop of Canterbury is held as the titular and spiritual head of the Anglican Communion, but his role is strictly an honorary one.  Lambeth Conferences  The conference of Anglican bishops from all parts of the world, instituted by Archbishop Longley in 1867 and known as the Lambeth Conferences, though even for the Anglican Communion they have not the authority of an ecumenical synod and their decisions are rather of the nature of counsels than commands, have done much to promote the harmony and co- operation of the various churches within Anglicanism. An even more imposing manifestation of this common life was given by the great Pan-Anglican Congress held in London between June 12 and June 24, 1908, which preceded the Lambeth Conference opened on July 5. The idea of this originated with Bishop Montgomery, secretary to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and was endorsed by a resolution of the United Boards of Mission in 1903. As the result of negotiations and preparations extending over five years, 250 bishops, together with delegates, clerical and lay, from every diocese in the Anglican Communion, met at Lambeth Palace, the opening service of intercession being held in Westminster Abbey. In its general character the meeting was but a church congress on an enlarged scale and the subjects discussed, e.g. the attitude of churchmen towards the question of the marriage laws or that of socialism, followed much the same lines. The conference had no power to decide or to legislate for the church, its main value being in drawing its scattered members closer together, in bringing the newer and more isolated parts into consciousness of their contact with the parent stem, and in opening the eyes of the Church of England to the point of view and the peculiar problems of the daughter-churches.  Bonn Agreement  In 1931 the Anglican Communion and the Old Catholics of the Union of Utrecht enter into full communion in the Bonn Agreement. Both the Old Catholics and the Anglicans agree on several key points: # Each communion recognises the catholicity and independence of the other and maintains its own. # Each communion agrees to permit members of the other communion to participate in the sacraments. # Inter-communion does not require from either communion the acceptance of all doctrinal opinion, sacramental devotion or liturgical practice characteristic of the other, but implies that each believes the other to hold all the essentials of the Christian faith. With this new inter-communion cross-episcopal ordinations began, further endorsing the apostolic succession within Anglicanism.  Modern history  Meetings began in 1937 about inter-communion between the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterians. After two years these talks arrived at no concrete conclusion because the Episcopalians insisted on the historic episcopate. The Presbyterians backed out of the talks in 1940.

He filled this role until 1854. Contributions and major works In 1825 Lassaigne partnered with Fran√ßois Leuret to publish \\"Recherches physiques et chimiques pour servir √† l‚Äôhistorie de la digestion\\" (Physical and chemical research for understanding digestion).

He became a chemical researcher, where he did research related to pure chemistry, inorganic chemistry, industrial chemistry, animal chemistry, and forensic chemistry, which led to many discoveries. His major works were studies about phosphoric ether, pyrocitric acid, pyro acids of the malic acid, chromium salts, and compounds of iodine. Lassaigne also did research on processes for the carbonization of organic matter. Lassaigne discovered new alkaloids and made major investigations related to toxicology of phosphorus and hydrocyanic acid. He also discovered new dyes, and in 1831 won an award by \\"Soci√©t√© d'Encouragement de l'Industrie\\" (Society for Encouragement of Industry) for his work on the process of enamel elaboration for pottery.

Traor√© Dynasty K√©n√©dougou was first established in the 1650s by the Senoufo people, who originate in modern-day Cote d'Ivoire. They began traversing the borders of Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana around the 13th century. The new kingdom was conveniently centered on the border of Mali and Burkina Faso. Its position was crucial to the exchange of desert and forest goods. Sadly, the Senoufo traditionalist practices put them at odds with the Muslims to their north. The Senoufo of Kenedougou adopted some Mand√© practices such as the king title of faama. Nanka Traor√© became K√©n√©dougou's first ruler and began the Traor√© dynasty, which would last into the late 19th century. There is little information about the kingdom's formative years, and approximately five to seven famas ruled between the foundation of the dynasty and Fama Douala ba I. K√©n√©dougou's existence was marked by relative peace compared to neighboring states of the period. K√©n√©dougou's Resistance This would all come to an end in the last quarter of the 19th century as the double threat of French colonialists and Samori Toure began swallowing up its commercial partners in the south, west and east. Possibly anticipating the inevitable outcome, Faama Tieba moved the capital of the kingdom to his mother's home city of Sikasso in 1877. There he built a new palace called the Mamelon on a strategic hill. The decision proved wise, as Tieba and his successor Babemba Traor√© fought a number of battles against both Samori Toure and the rapidly advancing French army. Ironically, the small kingdom of K√©n√©dougou would become one of the last major hold-outs against French ambitions in West Africa. The larger states were falling like dominoes to either Samori's Wassulu Empire or the French. Samori attacked Sikasso with an army of 12,000 men in April 1887, but failed to take the city. Then, from 1887 to 1888, the French besieged Sikasso but also met with defeat. In light of these threats, Tieba ordered the construction of a tata, or fortified wall, around the city in 1890. Parts of the tata have become one of present-day Sikasso's major tourist attractions. Following Tieba's death on January 1, 1893, his brother Babemba Traor√© assumed the throne. He held the French at bay for another five years. In 1897, the French conquered S√©gou, the capital of the K√©n√©dougou's northern neighbor, the Toucouleur Empire. This victory renewed the France's ambition toward Sikasso, and they prepared to take the city again determined to avenge the previous disgrace. French Conquest The French launched an artillery assault against Sikasso's tata in April 1898, and the city fell on May 1 of the same year. Rather than see the French take control of his city, Fama Babemba ordered his guards to kill him. The territory of the K√©n√©dougou Kingdom was soon assimilated into the colony of French Sudan, and later into the country of Mali. The memory of Tieba and Babemba are still revered to this day in Mali as symbols of African resistance to the French. ReferencesSources * Pascal James Imperato. Historical Dictionary of Mali.

Various tribes also inhabit(ed) Jolof (Jallof). ) of Senegal, West Africa. They closely resemble European fairies. The alternatively used name Bakhna Rakhna literally means good people, an interesting parallel to the Scottish fairies called Good Neighbours.Keightley, Thomas. \\"The Fairy Mythology: Illustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries\\", George Bell and Sons (1892), pp. 495-496.  Description  Yumboes are the spirits of the dead and, like many supernatural beings in African beliefs, they are completely of a pearly- white colour. They are sometimes said to have silver hair.Allardice, Pamela. Myths, Gods & Fantasy. ABC-CLIO (1991), p. 227. They stand about two feet tall. The Yumboes live beneath the Paps hills and come out to dance in the moonlight. They feast on large tables, waited on by servants who are invisible except for their hands and feet. Yumboes eat corn (which they steal from the humans) and fish (which they catch on their own). They invite both natives and foreigners to their feasts.  Background  The only source for yumboes is Thomas Keightley's book The Fairy Mythology. Keightley received his account from a woman who had lived on Goree Island, off the coast of Senegal, when she was a child. She had heard about the yumboes from a Wolof maid. Keightley remarked on the yumboes‚Äô resemblance to European fairies. However, they are also examples of the ancestral ghosts described in many African countries.  In popular culture  On Pottermore, yumboes appeared as African house elves and the mascots of Senegal's national quidditch team. One of the adventure gamebooks based on the television series Knightmare features yumboes as savage, flesh-eating creatures. Alighting on their island causes them to attack the player.

Based out of Lower Manhattan, its formation followed recommendations from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Governance , its Board of Directors has 27 members.Size of the Board of Directors was based on counting the number of names in the list. Based on past member lists, the number of board members is not constant. The Mayor of New York appoints seven members, including the chairperson. Ten additional members are appointed by the Mayor from nominees of the Borough Presidents and the Speaker of the New York City Council. Each Borough President nominates one member and the Speaker nominates five. Ten are appointed by the Chairperson from a list of persons approved by the Mayor. NYCEDC is not a New York City agency. Roles Through annual contracts with the City of New York, NYCEDC is a nonprofit organization that serves as the City‚Äôs primary entity for promoting and implementing economic development. , the NYCEDC had a role in setting rates of business taxation, an alternative to the passing of tax legislation. Specifically, the Corporation was charged with negotiating firm- specific tax incentives with businesses as encouragement to either relocate to, or remain in, New York City. The organization also: * Develops real estate, using partnerships between the public and private sectors. * Provides business, economic, and policy advice to the City, not-for-profit, and for- profit private sectors. * Manages City properties and assets, including manufacturing and distribution hubs and other infrastructure. * Invests in and provides financial tools that allow businesses and not-for-profits. * Conducts research, collects input from stakeholders, and launches initiatives. History NYCEDC was formed in 1991 as the result of a merger of two major not-for-profit and a handful of minor corporations which performed economic development services for the City. One of the major merger partners was the Public Development Corporation (PDC), formed in 1966 to rescue the City from its then-deteriorating economy by selling City property and leasing industrial space. PDC was responsible for construction of the Nassau Street Mall, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Jamaica Center, and the South Street Seaport, among other activities. The second major merger partner was the Financial Services Corporation (FSC) formed in 1980 to administer government financing programs that promote business expansion in New York City. Formation of the NYCEDC followed recommendations from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, who had been engaged in mid-1990 to \\"advise on the reorganisation of the NYC development system. Carl Weisbrod, formerly of PDC prior to its merger with FSC, was the first president of NYCEDC under the Dinkins administration. Weisbrod was succeeded by Charles Millard and Michael G. Carey under the Giuliani administration, followed by Andrew Alper, the first president appointed to the position during the Bloomberg administration. Robert C. Lieber was appointed in January 2007 and served until Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed him as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development & Rebuilding in December 2007. Seth Pinsky served as President from February 2008 to August 2013. =Applied Sciences NYC= One of NYCEDC‚Äôs largest initiatives to date is Applied Sciences NYC, a competition to create a new world-class engineering campus in NYC. In December 2011, Mayor Bloomberg announced the selection of a historic partnership with Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to create a groundbreaking, two-million-square foot applied science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island, to be called Cornell Tech. Applied Sciences NYC is expected to more than double the number of both full- time graduate engineering students and faculty in New York City. Over the next three decades the Applied Sciences NYC initiative is expected to generate more than $33 billion in overall nominal economic impact, add over 48,000 jobs, and launch nearly 1,000 spin-off companies. The Applied Sciences NYC initiative also includes the establishment of a campus in Downtown Brooklyn developed by a consortium led by NYU that focuses on the challenges facing cities, and a new institute for data sciences at Columbia University. =Other entities= New York City Industrial Development Agency (NYCIDA) is a public benefit corporation under New York State law that provides companies with access to tax-exempt bond financing or tax benefits to strengthen and diversify the City‚Äôs tax and employment base, helps businesses locate and expand their operations within New York City, and encourages economic development by retaining jobs and creating new ones. NYCIDA is administered by NYCEDC. New York City Capital Resource Corporation (NYCCRC), also administered by NYCEDC, is a local development corporation that provides lower-cost financing programs for eligible capital projects to qualified not-for-profit institutions and manufacturing, industrial, and other businesses.

Cornelis van Bijnkershoek (a.k.a. Cornelius van Bynkershoek) (29 May 1673, Middelburg ‚Äì 16 April 1743, The Hague) was a Dutch jurist and legal theorist who was educated at the University of Franeker. After two years study, he began to apply himself to jurisprudence. He later contributed to the development of international law in works like De Dominio Maris Dissertatio (1702); Observationes Juris Romani (1710), of which a continuation in four books appeared in 1733; the treatise De foro legatorum (1721); and the Quaestiones Juris Publici (1737). Online copy. Complete editions of his works were published after his death; one in folio at Geneva in 1761, and another in two volumes folio at Leiden in 1766. He was president of the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (Supreme Court of the Dutch Republic) from 1724 to 1743. Van Bynkershoek was especially important in the development of the Law of the Sea. In particular he furthered Hugo Grotius' idea that coastal states have a right to the adjoining waters the width of which had to correspond to the capacity of exercising an effective control over it, that he expressed in his famous book De Iure Belli Ac Pacis. Bynkershoek translated Grotius idea into practical terms, by arguing that such effective control has to correspond to the range of the coastal state's weapons: \\"terrae potestas finitur ubi finitur armorum vis\\". However, instead of him, it was Italian Ferdinand Galiami who calculated the range of the most advanced cannon at the time to three nautical miles or a league. This idea became common practice and was known as the \\"cannon shot rule\\" and was regarded as the internationally accepted measure of the width of the territorial sea.

The classic gables of Amsterdam‚Äôs canal houses inspired the arches and lateral gables and the wavy patterns refer to water. The segmented appearance is based on the skeleton of a crab.

The LMTD is a logarithmic average of the temperature difference between the hot and cold feeds at each end of the double pipe exchanger. For a given heat exchanger with constant area and heat transfer coefficient, the larger the LMTD, the more heat is transferred. The use of the LMTD arises straightforwardly from the analysis of a heat exchanger with constant flow rate and fluid thermal properties.  Definition  We assume that a generic heat exchanger has two ends (which we call \\"A\\" and \\"B\\") at which the hot and cold streams enter or exit on either side; then, the LMTD is defined by the logarithmic mean as follows: :The LMTD illustrated in a countercurrent temperature profileLMTD =\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T_A - \\\\Delta T_B}{\\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta T_A}{\\\\Delta T_B} \\\\right ) } =\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T_A - \\\\Delta T_B}{\\\\ln \\\\Delta T_A - \\\\ln \\\\Delta T_B} where ŒîTA is the temperature difference between the two streams at end A, and ŒîTB is the temperature difference between the two streams at end B. With this definition, the LMTD can be used to find the exchanged heat in a heat exchanger: : Q = U \\\\times A \\\\times LMTD Where Q is the exchanged heat duty (in watts), U is the heat transfer coefficient (in watts per kelvin per square meter) and A is the exchange area. Note that estimating the heat transfer coefficient may be quite complicated. This holds both for cocurrent flow, where the streams enter from the same end, and for countercurrent flow, where they enter from different ends. In a cross-flow, in which one system, usually the heat sink, has the same nominal temperature at all points on the heat transfer surface, a similar relation between exchanged heat and LMTD holds, but with a correction factor. A correction factor is also required for other more complex geometries, such as a shell and tube exchanger with baffles. Derivation Assume heat transfer is occurring in a heat exchanger along an axis z, from generic coordinate A to B, between two fluids, identified as 1 and 2, whose temperatures along z are T1(z) and T2(z). The local exchanged heat flux at z is proportional to the temperature difference: : q(z) = U (T_2(z)-T_1(z))/D = U (\\\\Delta\\\\;T(z))/D, where D is the distance between the two fluids. The heat that leaves the fluids causes a temperature gradient according to Fourier's law: ::\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,T_1}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}=k_a (T_1(z)-T_2(z))=-k_a\\\\,\\\\Delta T(z) ::\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,T_2}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}=k_b (T_2(z)-T_1(z))=k_b\\\\,\\\\Delta T(z) where ka and kb are the thermal conductivities of the intervening material at points A and B respectively. Summed together, this becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,\\\\Delta T}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,(T_2-T_1)}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,T_2}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,T_1}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}=K\\\\Delta T(z) where K=ka+kb. The total exchanged energy is found by integrating the local heat transfer q from A to B: : Q = \\\\int^{B}_{A} q(z) dz = \\\\frac{U}{D} \\\\int^{B}_{A} \\\\Delta T(z) dz = \\\\frac{U}{D} \\\\int^{B}_{A} \\\\Delta T \\\\,dz Use the fact that the heat exchanger area Ar is the pipe length B-A multiplied by the interpipe distance D: : Q = \\\\frac{U Ar}{(B-A)} \\\\int^{B}_{A} \\\\Delta T \\\\,dz = \\\\frac{U Ar \\\\int^{B}_{A} \\\\Delta T \\\\,dz}{\\\\int^{B}_{A} \\\\,dz} In both integrals, make a change of variables from z to Œî T: : Q = \\\\frac{U Ar \\\\int^{\\\\Delta T(B)}_{\\\\Delta T(A)} \\\\Delta T \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,\\\\Delta T}\\\\,d(\\\\Delta T)}{\\\\int^{\\\\Delta T(B)}_{\\\\Delta T(A)} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,z}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,\\\\Delta T}\\\\,d(\\\\Delta T)} With the relation for Œî T found above, this becomes : Q = \\\\frac{U Ar \\\\int^{\\\\Delta T(B)}_{\\\\Delta T(A)} \\\\frac{1}{K}\\\\,d(\\\\Delta T)}{\\\\int^{\\\\Delta T(B)}_{\\\\Delta T(A)} \\\\frac{1}{K \\\\Delta T}\\\\,d(\\\\Delta T)} Integration at this point is trivial, and finally gives: : Q = U \\\\times Ar \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\Delta T(B)-\\\\Delta T(A)}{\\\\ln [ \\\\Delta T(B) / \\\\Delta T(A) ]} , from which the definition of LMTD follows.  Assumptions and limitations  * It has been assumed that the rate of change for the temperature of both fluids is proportional to the temperature difference; this assumption is valid for fluids with a constant specific heat, which is a good description of fluids changing temperature over a relatively small range. However, if the specific heat changes, the LMTD approach will no longer be accurate. * A particular case for the LMTD are condensers and reboilers, where the latent heat associated to phase change is a special case of the hypothesis. For a condenser, the hot fluid inlet temperature is then equivalent to the hot fluid exit temperature. * It has also been assumed that the heat transfer coefficient (U) is constant, and not a function of temperature.

It travels from IL 47 in Yorkville to Interstate 55 (I-55) between Plainfield and Bolingbrook.  Route description  IL 126 at its western terminus IL 126 begins at an intersection with IL 47 in Yorkville, and travels as a rural two-lane road until it intersects historic Lincoln Highway and enters Plainfield as West Lockport Road. Immediately after crossing the DuPage River, it turns northeast onto Main Street, bypassing Downtown Plainfield, and intersects the concurrency of US 30 and IL 59 at North Division Street. It continues northeastward out of Plainfield on Main Street until it ends at an intersection with I-55. There is no access to IL 126 from northbound I-55. Likewise, there is no southbound I-55 access from IL 126\\\\. IL 126 westbound entering Kendall County For most of its length, IL 126 is an undivided two-lane surface road, until a high-speed ramp is used to access northbound I-55 at its eastern terminus. Congestion in Plainfield is increasing substantially on this highway, IL 59, and US 30 because of near-explosive growth in Plainfield, a southwest suburb of Chicago.  History  The history of IL 126, in both of its incarnations, is tied closely to the history of US 66\\\\. The original State Bond Issue Route 126 (SBI 126) was opened in 1930 to carry the then-new US 66 from Springfield to Litchfield, bypassing the numerous towns along IL 4\\\\. Initially, this road was marked as both US 66 and IL 126. In 1934, the concurrency of IL 126 was removed, and this road was known only as US 66. SBI 66 originally traveled from Plainfield to Welco Corners in present-day Bolingbrook, where it intersected SBI 4. However, by then, SBI 4 was also designated as US 66, which created confusion with IL 66, so, in 1935, IL 66 was given the route number \\"126\\", which had been removed from US 66 in southern Illinois, and the new IL 126 was extended west from Plainfield to Yorkville. In 1940, US 66 was rerouted through Plainfield to bypass congestion in Joliet, and IL 126 was truncated to travel only from Yorkville to Plainfield, with US 66 taking over IL 126 (SBI 66) from Plainfield to Welco Corners. When US 66 was rerouted in 1957 onto its new freeway alignment bypassing Plainfield, which would later become I-55, IL 126 was re-extended east from Plainfield along its pre-1940 route to meet I-55/US 66. This resulted in the section of the highway from Plainfield to I-55/US 66 having had four route numbers in its history: 66, 126, 66 (again), and 126 (again). Until US 30 was rerouted in 2008, IL 126 was concurrent with it for a short distance approaching Plainfield from the west, between Lincoln Highway and IL 126's turn to the northeast onto Main Street.

He played for Racing Club de Avellaneda and Hurac√°n before becoming a manager. He coached many teams during his career, being most notable the Racing Club de Avellaneda (where he won the Supercopa Libertadores, the first international title for the club since 1967), the Argentina national team (with 4 titles won) and Boca Juniors, where he won five titles in two years. The last team managed by Basile was Racing Club de Avellaneda, which he left in 2012. Playing career Racing Club, 1966 Born in Bah√≠a Blanca, Basile started his playing career at Club Bella Vista in his home city. From 1964 to 1970 he played for Racing Club, where he played as midfielder until the arrival of coach Juan Jos√© Pizutti, who moved him to the defensive line to play as centre-back. In that position, Basile formed a remembered defensive pair with Roberto Perfumo, winning three titles with the club, which reached its peak with the Intercontinental Cup won in 1967 to Celtic FC, the first intercontinental title for an Argentine team. Basile totalized 186 matches with Racing Club before moving to Hurac√°n, where he was a mainstay of the 1973 Metropolitano champions under coach C√©sar Luis Menotti.

The run-up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup looked smooth until a 5-0 defeat at home to Colombia. Following that traumatic event, Diego Maradona was brought back from retirement to take part in the play-off against Australia. In the World Cup itself, Argentina opened with two impressive victories over Greece and Nigeria. However, controversy was soon to appear. Maradona was tested for doping after the Nigeria match, and was suspended after ephedrine was found in his sample. Argentina still progressed to the last 16 despite a 2-0 defeat by Bulgaria, but morale was shattered and the team was eliminated after losing to Romania.

It runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel, a three joint muscle (knee, ankle and subtalar joints). The muscle is named via Latin, from Greek Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅ (gaster) 'belly' or 'stomach' and Œ∫ŒΩŒÆŒºŒ∑ (kn·∏ómƒì) 'leg', meaning 'stomach of leg' (referring to the bulging shape of the calf). Structure The gastrocnemius is located with the soleus in the posterior (back) compartment of the leg. The lateral head originates from the lateral condyle of the femur, while the medial head originates from the medial condyle of the femur. Its other end forms a common tendon with the soleus muscle; this tendon is known as the calcaneal tendon or Achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus, or heel bone. It is considered a superficial muscle as it is located directly under skin, and its shape may often be visualized through the skin. Deep to the gastrocnemius (farther from the skin) is the soleus muscle. Some anatomists consider both to be a single muscle‚Äîthe triceps surae or \\"three-headed [muscle] of the calf\\"‚Äîsince they share a common insertion via the Achilles tendon. The plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles, which is involved in \\"locking\\" the knee from the standing position. Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial to the mid-shaft of the tibia. =Variation= 10% to 30% of individuals have a sesamoid bone called the \\"fabella\\" in the lateral (outer) head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Function Along with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle. Its function is plantar flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint. The gastrocnemius is primarily involved in running, jumping and other \\"fast\\" movements of leg, and to a lesser degree in walking and standing. This specialization is connected to the predominance of white muscle fibers (type II fast twitch) present in the gastrocnemius, as opposed to the soleus, which has more red muscle fibers (type I slow twitch) and is the primary active muscle when standing still, as determined by EMG studies. = Motor pathway = The plan to use the gastrocnemius in running, jumping, knee and plantar flexing is created in the precentral gyrus in the cerebrum of the brain. Once a plan is produced, the signal is sent to and down an upper motor neuron. The signal is passed through the internal capsule and decussates, or crosses, in the medulla oblongata, specifically in the lateral corticospinal tract. The signal continues down through the anterior horn of the spinal cord where the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron. Signal propagation continues down the anterior rami (Lumbar 4-5 and Sacral 1-5) of the sacral plexus. The sciatic nerve branches off of the sacral plexus in which the tibial and common fibular nerves are wrapped in one sheath. The tibial nerve eventually separates from the sciatic nerve and innervates the gastrocnemius muscle. Thus, completing the plan the brain had originally started with, so that the actions of running, standing, and jumping could be executed. Clinical significance The gastrocnemius muscle is prone to spasms, which are painful, involuntary contractions of the muscle that may last several minutes. A severe ankle dorsiflexion force may result in an injury of the muscle, commonly referred to as a \\"torn\\" or \\"strained\\" calf muscle, which is acutely painful and disabling. The gastrocnemius muscle may also become inflamed due to overuse. Anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy (heat, massage, and stretching) may be useful. Anatomical abnormalities involving the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle result in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. History In a 1967 EMG study, Herman and Bragin concluded that its most important role was plantar flexing in large contractions and in rapid development of tension.

Biography Weston was the eldest son and heir of Sir Jerome Weston, High Sheriff of Essex for 1599, and the former Mary Cave. He was born at Roxwell, Essex, and was a student of the Middle Temple. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a number of constituencies including Maldon (1601‚Äì1603), Midhurst (in the parliament of 1604-1611), Essex (in the Addled Parliament of 1614), Arundel (1622), Bossiney (1624), Callington (1625) and Bodmin (1626). He was knighted in 1603. Arms of Sir Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, KG During the reign of King James I of England, Weston was sent on embassies to Bohemia, Brussels, and Spain. On the last assignment, he negotiated for the restitution of the Palatine. Upon his return to England in 1621, he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, and retained the post after the accession of Charles I; he proved a capable financial manager but incurred popular hatred as a (justly) suspected Roman Catholic, while also later earning the enmity of the (Catholic) queen, Henrietta Maria for refusing grants to her favourites. He opposed wars with Spain in 1623 and France in 1626, but managed to find ways of raising the money to fund them when required, even when it was impossible to secure the co-operation of Parliament.Kenyon, J. P. The Stuarts B.T. Batsford Ltd. 1959 p.72 Weston was elevated to the peerage on 13 April 1628 as Baron Weston of Nayland in Suffolk. He was subsequently made Lord Treasurer of England and invested with the Order of the Garter.Cokayne Complete Peerage 2000 Reprint Vol.1, p. 428 His policies proving highly unpopular, he escaped impeachment in 1629 only by the dissolution of Parliament. Nevertheless, he played an important role in the King's Personal Rule without Parliament, finding new sources of revenue while preventing any further increase in the King's expenditure, and being for a time the most influential of Charles's advisers. He persuaded the King to make peace with France in 1629 and Spain in 1630, removing the biggest drain on the treasury, and to sign the secret treaty with Spain in 1634. By the time he died in 1635, the Crown was solvent.Kenyon, J.P. Stuart England Penguin Books 1990 reissue p.126 On 17 February 1633, Weston was created Earl of Portland. Lord Portland was married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Pincheon of Writtle in Essex. His second wife was Frances Waldegrave of Borley in Essex. He had three children by his first marriage, including Lady Mary Weston (2 January 1603-after August 1678), who married the 2nd Lord Aston of Forfar in 1629, and Lady Elizabeth Weston, who married John Netterville, 2nd Viscount Netterville.

In 746 she and others left Wimborne Minster in Dorset to join her kinsman Boniface in his mission to the German people. She was a learned woman and was involved in the foundation of nunneries in Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt. She had a leading role in evangelizing the area. Leoba was acclaimed for many miracles: saving a village from fire; saving a town from a terrible storm; protecting the reputation of the nuns in her convent; and saving the life of a fellow nun who was gravely ill ‚Äì all accomplished through prayer.  Early life  She was born Leofgyth in Wessex to a noble family, the only child of elderly parents, Dynne and √Übbe. Her mother was related to Boniface, and Boniface was a friend of her father's. Her mother had a dream in which she would conceive \\"the chosen/ beloved\\" child of Christ. This dream also told her mother that her offspring was to lead a spiritual life, and to serve the church. The name \\"Leob\\" means \\"greatly loved\\", with Leofgyth being from Old Engish l√©of or l√≠of 'beloved, dear' and g√Ω√æ or g√∫√æ 'battle'. It is said that Leofgyth was trained first by abbess Edburga at Minster-in-Thanet,\\"Leoba, abbess of Tauberbischofsheim\\", Epistolae: Medieval Women's Latin Letters, Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning, Columbia University but Dame Catherine Wynbourne, O.S.B. says the evidence for this is slight, although Leoba may have periodically visited Thanet.Wynbourne O.S.B., \\"Leoba: A Study in Humanity and Holiness\\", Medieval Women Monastics, (Miriam Schmitt, Linda Kulzer, eds.), Liturgical Press, 1996 She entered the double monastery of Wimborne Minster as an oblate and was entrusted to the care of the Abbess Tetta. Later, Leoba entered the community as a nun. The nuns of Wimbourne were skilled at copying and ornamenting manuscripts, and celebrated for Opus Anglicanum, a fine needlework often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen, often decorated with jewels and pearls. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe.Brownlow, Canon. \\"The Brother and Sister and Saint Willibald\\", Report and Transactions - The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art, Vol. 23, 1891, p. 228 Willibald indicates that nuns as well as monks attended Winfred/Boniface's lectures at Nhutscelle, which was not far from Wimbourne. Boniface maintained correspondence with a number of religious houses in Britain. Leoba wrote Boniface requesting prayers for her parents. Some years later, he decided to invite some nuns to come from England to establish themselves in various parts of the country. To this end he sent a letter to Abbess Tetta requesting that she send Leoba and others to assist with his mission of spreading Christianity in Germany.Ellsberg, Robert. Blessed Among Us: Day by Day with Saintly Witnesses, Liturgical Press, 2016, p.559 Boniface specifically requested Leoba because he thought that many would benefit from her holiness and example. Leoba once experienced a dream in which a purple thread was coming from her mouth. She pulled the thread repeatedly until she rolled it into a ball. The labor of this caused her extreme fatigue and resulted in her waking up from her dream. Out of curiosity, she employed a fellow nun to seek out a nun who was known to reveal prophecies. This nun listened to the explanation of the dream and said that this dream represented the life of leadership that Leoba was to live and that she was destined to be a wise teacher and a great counselor.Thomas F.X. Noble. Soldiers of Christ: Saints and Saints‚Äô Lives from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Penn State University Press, 1995 In 748, Leoba, together with Thecla and others, traveled to Germany to aid Boniface in his apostolic labours.  Life as a missionary  Boniface established a convent in the Franconian town Tauberbischofsheim, where she became the abbess. He entrusted her with a great deal of authority, and Rudolf of Fulda indicates that she was not merely in charge of her own house but of all of the nuns who worked with Boniface. In 754, when Boniface was preparing a missionary trip to Frisia, he gave his monastic cowl to Leoba to indicate that, when he was away, she was his delegate. She was a learned woman, and in the following years she was involved in the foundation of nunneries in Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt. She had a leading role in evangelizing her area, and during her life she was credited with quelling a storm with her command. Additionally, bishops in Fulda consulted her, and she was the only woman allowed to enter into monasteries in Fulda to consult the ecclesiastical leaders on issues of monastic rule. She was also favoured in the court of Pippin III, and Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne, was her friend.  Later years  In her later years, she retired with a few other Anglo-Saxon nuns to an estate near Mainz in Schornsheim. The estate was given by Charlemagne for her exclusive use. She died on 28 September 782. Boniface's will had originally designated that Leoba was to be buried in his own tomb. When Leoba died, however, she was placed in a tomb near his.  Miracles  Leoba was acclaimed for many miracles: saving a village from fire; saving a town from a terrible storm; protecting the reputation of the nuns in her convent; and saving the life of a fellow nun who was gravely ill ‚Äì all accomplished through prayer. According to Rudolf of Fulda, Leoba's grave was the site of many miracles. These miracles include: freeing a man of tightly bound iron rings around his arms and curing a man from Spain of his twitching disorder. Due to these miracles, some of which were witnessed by Rudolf,Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúLioba‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921.

Her relics were translated twice and are now behind an altar in a church dedicated to Mary and the virgins of Christ in Petersburg in Fulda. Some fifty years after her death, Rudolf of Fulda was commissioned to write the acta of her life (Vita Leobae) in connection with this second translation of relics.

It first opened in 2000, but has been closed since it was seriously damaged by flooding during Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. It is currently owned by the Industrial Development Board (IDB) of New Orleans. Six Flags had leased the park from 2002 until 2009, when the lease was terminated during its bankruptcy proceedings. The former park is located in New Orleans East off Interstate 10. Despite various proposals to redevelop the site, it has remained abandoned, overgrown with plants, infested with wildlife and in poor condition. Despite these deterrents, videos and photos of the site have surfaced over the years from thrill-seekers and YouTube users. As a result, city officials became more diligent in securing the park and banning tours. The city has assigned police officers from the New Orleans Police Department to patrol the abandoned site and arrest offenders. In July 2019, mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the New Orleans government would explore the possibility of demolishing the site. This idea stemmed from reports that the park's wildlife and overall condition had been disturbing local residents. An analysis estimated that it would cost around $1.3 million to demolish the park. The city generates money for itself by leasing the park on-and-off as a filming location to various production companies. Functioning amusement park, 2000‚Äì05=Jazzland (2000‚Äì2002)= The park opened under the name Jazzland in 2000. It was operated by Alfa Smartparks (later Odgen Entertainment and now known as Palace Entertainment), but owned by a Spanish company called Parques Reunidos. Rides included Mega Zeph, a wooden roller coaster track built on a steel frame to prevent termite infestation and withstand hurricane-force winds. Mega Zeph was inspired by the old Zephyr roller coaster at the closed Pontchartrain Beach Amusement Park that was located next to Lake Pontchartrain by the University of New Orleans. The intent was to rebuild the Zephyr, but it was a smaller roller coaster, so that idea was scrapped in favor of the current larger Mega Zeph. Other rides included a junior steel coaster called Rex's Rail Runner, a wild mouse steel coaster and a common steel shuttle looping Vekoma boomerang rollercoaster called a Zydeco Scream. The park had a log flume called Cypress Plunge and a splashwater falls ride called Spillway Splashout. In addition, the park had common amusement park spinning rides and a carousel merry-go-round. The park was not profitable, as Alpha Smart Parks specialized in running water parks and smaller amusement arcade centers. In 2001, the lease was put up for sale, and in March 2002 Six Flags purchased the lease, although the park's name did not change that year. =Six Flags New Orleans (2003‚Äì2005)= The Batman ride at Six Flags New Orleans in 2004 In early 2003, Six Flags upgraded the park and renamed it Six Flags New Orleans. Six Flags added more shaded areas and many new flat spinning rides. The park was renamed Six Flags, and the \\"it's playtime!\\" theme was adopted that included a dancing old man, Mr. Six. They added a Bolliger & Mabillard inverted coaster named Batman: The Ride (a mirrored version of the B&M; Batman: The Ride coaster model) relocated from the defunct Thrill Valley in Japan, and a Vekoma multiple looping coaster called The Jester relocated from Six Flags Fiesta Texas. A water park that would be included in the admission (like Six Flags Parks such as Six Flags St. Louis and Six Flags America, for example) was in the planning stages in early 2005 and was going to be announced at the end of August. However, Hurricane Katrina was about to strike New Orleans, which put those plans and the continued operations of the park in question. The last day the park operated was August 21, 2005, eight days before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Weekday operations had ended a couple of weeks earlier, as schools start early in August in the New Orleans area and end in mid-May. The park was scheduled to reopen on August 27 or August 28, but once Katrina was forecast late on Friday, August 26 to directly hit New Orleans, the weekend re-opening was cancelled in order to prepare for the storm and begin evacuations. =Themed areas= * Main Street Square (Formerly Jazz Plaza) * Cajun Country * Pontchartrain Beach * DC Comics Super Hero Adventures * Looney Tunes Adventures (Formerly Kids' Carnival) * Mardi Gras * Good Time Gardens  Hurricane Katrina  Because the park was located next to Lake Pontchartrain, the park installed drainage pipes to protect it from flooding. Then on the morning of August 29, 2005, just after sunrise, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. New Orleans suffered $70 billion in damages as many people stayed at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and up to 1,464 people died in New Orleans. Over 80% of New Orleans was flooded. At the park, the water from Lake Pontchartrain overflowed onto the theme park after the park's drainage pipes failed to keep up with the flow of water and flooded the entire park for the duration of Katrina. After Katrina left New Orleans, the park was submerged deep. It took over a month for the water to leave the park, leaving devastation in its wake. After Hurricane Katrina The park still flooded two weeks after Hurricane Katrina The ruins of The Jester as seen in 2009 The park grounds are located on a low-lying section of Eastern New Orleans, with a earthen flood berm running along the perimeter, creating an artificial basin. As such, this area was heavily flooded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After the park's drainage pumps failed during the storm, the berm retained the combination of rainwater and sea water overflow from Lake Pontchartrain caused by Katrina's massive storm surge, submerging the entire park grounds in corrosive, brackish floodwater to a depth of for over a month. Due to the extensive water and wind damage received, the park was closed indefinitely without plans to reopen. Six Flags New Orleans sign after Hurricane Katrina Initial damage reports by Six Flags inspectors stated that the park buildings were 80% demolished, all of the flat rides (except for one which was being serviced off-site at the time of the storm) were effectively destroyed by long term salt-water immersion and both the wooden track and steel superstructure of the Mega Zeph were likely damaged beyond repair. The only large ride to escape relatively unscathed was the Batman: The Ride roller-coaster, due to its elevated station platform and corrosion-resistant support structure. The vandalism and post-Hurricane Katrina look of SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride in 2011 On July 1, 2006, having announced that the park would be closed \\"at least\\" through 2007, Six Flags announced that it had concluded its damage assessments and declared the park to be an \\"effective total loss\\"‚Äîwith no desire or intent by the company to undertake the prohibitive cost of rebuilding‚Äîand was in negotiations with the City of New Orleans to make an early exit from the 75-year lease which Six Flags entered into on the property in 2002. However, then-Mayor Ray Nagin said he planned to hold Six Flags to the lease agreement and force them to rebuild. If held to the terms of the lease agreement, Six Flags would have been legally obligated to rebuild the park on the same site, but only to the extent of the insurance money Six Flags received. Six Flags determined the value of assets destroyed by the storm at $32.5 million. As of September 2006, Six Flags had collected $11.5 million of insurance proceeds, bringing the insurance receivable balance to $24.4 million. In January 2007, Six Flags officials revealed to the New Orleans Times-Picayune that the company was suing its insurers for the remaining $17.5 million in coverage. The park had been one of the least profitable parks in the Six Flags portfolio. Though the park was located in New Orleans East near some of the area's more affluent neighborhoods, the park was originally budgeted to bring in tourists from the city's downtown attractions to supplement the city's relatively smaller population base (New Orleans had been experiencing a declining population before Hurricane Katrina). However, near the time that the storm struck, Six Flags had already begun closing some of its smaller, less profitable parks across the country. Hurricane Katrina cemented the New Orleans park as another of Six Flags' portfolio that would eventually close permanently. On December 15, 2006, Six Flags confirmed that it was removing Batman: The Ride for refurbishment and relocation to a new park, as it was considered to be the only salvageable ride. Batman: The Ride was reassembled at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio and opened under the new name Goliath on April 18, 2008. In addition to Batman: The Ride, Six Flags removed shade coverings, ride parts, lights, security cameras, planting structures and various other salvageable items. Besides Batman: The Ride, other rides were later removed from the park. Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam were removed in 2008 and taken to Great Escape in Queensbury, New York, where the ride was refurbished and reopened under the name Sasquatch on May 10, 2009. The Road Runner Express was removed in 2009 and taken to Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, where it was refurbished and reopened on May 28, 2011 under the same name. As late as the fall of 2009, the Six Flags website said the company was \\"still in the process of settling claims with its insurers due to substantial damage caused by Hurricane Katrina,\\" adding that the park would remain closed. The statement ended with \\"We know that it is still a difficult time for the residents of New Orleans and we remain committed to working with the city in support of the recovery efforts.\\"Archive.org snapshot of sixflags.com, September 21, 2009 Rides and attractions that are still standing=Main Street Square= * Zydeco Zinger (Fabbri Wave Swinger) =Cajun Country= * Muskrat Scrambler (L&T; Systems Wild Mouse) * Lafitte's Pirate Ship (Fabbri Pirate Ship) * Ozarka Splash (Hopkins Rides log flume formerly known as Cypress Plunge) * Gator Bait (Huss Airboat) * SpongeBob SquarePants The Ride (SimEx-Iwerks motion simulator) =DC Comics Super Hero Adventures= * Catwoman's Whip (Mondial Shake) * Joker's Jukebox (Wieland Schwarzkopf Polyp) * Lex Luthor's Invertatron (Soriani & Moser Super Loop on Top) =Pontchartrain Beach= * Beach Bang-Up (Reverchon Bumper Cars) * The Big Easy (Vekoma Ferris Wheel) * Zydeco Scream (Vekoma Boomerang) * Dizzy Lizzy (Fabbri Boomerang) =Mardi Gras= * The Jester (Vekoma Hurricane) * Mega Zeph (Custom Coasters International Double Out and Back wooden hybrid) * Krazy Krewe (Fabbri Cataclysm) * Mad Rex (Chance Morgan Wipeout) * Jocco's Mardi Gras Madness (Sally Corporation interactive dark ride) * Spillway Splashout (Hopkins Rides Shoot the Chutes) * Skycoaster (Skycoaster Inc.

Redevelopment proposals=Southern Star Amusement (2008‚Äì11)= Debris still on Ozarka Splash in 2011 In April 2008, Southern Star Amusement Inc. proposed to take over the site lease from the then-owner Six Flags, promising to expand the park to over 60 rides (more than double its pre-Katrina size), complete a water park that Six Flags had been planning, and add an RV park. Southern Star Amusement Inc. pledged to open the park as Legend City Adventure Park, with 60 rides in place, including a new water park by the summer of 2009 if the city approved the lease takeover, with the campground to follow. One issue concerning rebuilding was Six Flags' continued removal of infrastructure from the park. In a quarterly conference call Six Flags discussed plans to remove the S&S; Towers by 2009 with more ride removals to follow. Items from existing Jazzland rides, such as Mega Zeph's trains and Spillway Splashout's boats, were sent to other parks. On September 27, 2008, Southern Star stated on its website that it would no longer be trying to revive Six Flags New Orleans. A skateboarder jumps over a fallen alligator statue in 2011. In February 2009, Southern Star was taking another look at the park and considering a takeover bid with the City of New Orleans. Southern Star planned a scaled down effort, with intentions only to reopen the park with a water park added within the existing midway area. The idea was to reopen and build incrementally, saving about $50 million in improvements for the next few years. Given the poor economic situation at the time, this plan seemed to be the only way that the park could be saved. The basic idea was to use investors and Go Zone Bonds to raise the $35 to $40 million needed to just reopen the park with basic improvements that are needed to make a real recovery and profit. Southern Star's CEO Danny R. Rogers asked that Six Flags stop all removal action of equipment from the park, as the equipment in question belongs to the City of New Orleans and not Six Flags. The return of other equipment taken from the park by Six Flags was also requested. On August 18, 2009, it was announced that the land would be redeveloped into a Nickelodeon Universe theme/water park.Nickelodeon Enters Into Licensing Arrangement to Create a New Nickelodeon-branded theme/water park in New Orleans, Louisiana On September 18, 2009, the city of New Orleans fined Six Flags $3 million and ordered the park to vacate its lease. (On June 13, 2009, the Six Flags had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.) As of early 2010, the site was overgrown with debris and weeds. Removal of the debris and underbrush had begun.http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/wwl050508tpsixflags.d0c8f24c.html As of April 11, 2010, the site was still shut down with no clear future, since the city of New Orleans owned the property by this time and the plans for the Nickelodeon-branded theme park fell through three months after bonds failed to come through. On January 21, 2011, Southern Star went public with its third redevelopment plans for the park, posting a link on their company website. On January 26, 2011, Southern Star posted a Letter of Intent for the park on its website. The redevelopment plans gave a brief history of the property, pre and post-Katrina condition photos, development concept photos, written descriptions of each phase of the redevelopment procedure and business projections for when it opens. During \\"Phase I\\", Southern Star planned to restore what is left of the park, and expand it by adding more rides and reverting the park back to its original Louisiana theme. The park would be revamped to reflect Louisiana's history and heritage, with one of the proposed sections paying tribute to the now defunct Pontchartrain Beach, which closed in 1983. \\"Phase II\\" entailed adding a water park and future expansion phases included adding a youth sports complex, an on-site hotel/resort and a movie studio/backlot that would cater to the needs of various production companies filming in the New Orleans area. Plans also included developing an entertainment and shopping district within the park. These plans entailed utilizing all of the site of which only were to be developed and occupied by the remains of the Six Flags New Orleans park. The Letter of Intent from Southern Star set out a lease agreement between the city and the company stating Southern Star's proposed terms of the lease and its intent for utilizing and restoring the area. The company would enter a 75-year lease and take on the property in its current condition. Southern Star planned to take possession of the property prior to the establishment of the lease in order to provide preliminary security and repair/cleanup services. The lease would not have taken effect until Southern Star had taken possession of the property, started the cleanup process and provided proof of funding to the city. After that, the city had 15 days to execute its end of the agreement. Any and all improvements made would belong to the company and the lease would end in the year 2018. The plans never came to fruition, however. =Jazzland Outlet Mall (2011‚Äì14)= Entrance to the proposed Jazzland Outlet Mall In August 2011, the city of New Orleans called for proposals for redevelopment ideas for the site. Eight entrepreneurs stepped forward to suggest turning the property into a power plant, a theme park, or even an outlet mall. On November 29, 2011, the city of New Orleans chose two of the proposed projects: an outlet mall and a green theme park. On February 6, 2012, it was reported that the selection committee rejected the plan for the site of Six Flags New Orleans to become a theme park, leaving the upscale outlet mall as the only proposal being considered by the committee. Despite the committee's actions, one of the original eight entrepreneurs continued to try to get public support for their Jazzland Park proposal, which includes the addition of a water park and movie studio back lot.Jazzland Park On March 6, 2012, the city of New Orleans gave the green light to build Jazzland Outlet Mall to Provident Realty Advisors and DAG Development. The proposal was for a upscale outlet mall and entertainment boardwalk on the former theme park site, costing $40 million for part of Phase One and using some of the existing rides from the theme park. Construction would have taken between three and four years. During the planned period of due diligence and pre-construction, in March 2013 the development plans were abruptly called off. The developer cited competition from the planned expansion of Riverwalk Marketplace to include an outlet mall, making the Jazzland Outlet Mall concept unviable. However, as of the summer of 2013, Provident Realty Advisors and DAG Development has been back at the negotiating table with the city to come up with a new idea for the park; they will have to present a development plan to the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in October 2013, according to a contract. Once presented IDB will then accept or reject the proposal. The contract also states that construction of an outlet mall is to proceed, but it does not explicitly prohibit giving the developers an opportunity to put something else there. =Use as film shoot location (2011‚Äìpresent)= An image taken during the filming of Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters at the park In 2011, Killer Joe was filmed in the park featuring the wooden coaster Mega Zeph. Stolen was also filmed at the park that year. Stolen used the Main Street Square section to double as the Quarter. Additionally, a burning car was driven into the lagoon and the Orpheum Theatre was used as the home of the film's villain. The Industrial Development Board (IDB) agreed to let 20th Century Fox film the 2013 film Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters in the theme park during the summer of 2012 through August. Mega Zeph, Ozarka Splash and The Big Easy are three rides that have been shot for the film along with five other rides that the production crew had brought into the park, since all the original rides were rendered inoperable to shoot for the film. Before shooting at the park for five weeks, the production crew took two weeks to restore the derelict park into the needed condition by installing lighting and covering up graffiti on the buildings. The park portrays the fictional Circeland on the island of Polyphemus that was built by the goddess Circe, only to be destroyed by the cyclops Polyphemus. During the summer of 2013, portions of the park were being filmed for the movie Dawn of the Planet of the Apes until mid-August. The park was also used to film portions of the movie Jurassic World in June 2014. Jurassic World used the parking lot as the location for the Jurassic World park. Deepwater Horizon built its oil rig set in the parking lot. Deepwater Horizon was the last film to use the parking lot. No movie studio has signed up to use the park for filming since August 2015. In January 2015, the park was photographed as part of a photo essay/series by Cleveland-based photographer Johnny Joo. In this series, Joo documented the abandoned or historic structures of New Orleans, which still remained 10 years after Hurricane Katrina. He also documented portions of revitalization in the community of New Orleans to show how the area has been rebuilt after one of the largest natural disasters in United States history. In 2016, the video game Mafia III, is set in a fictional version of New Orleans. The abandoned amusement park in that game features a partially flooded site, a similar entranceway, and a roller-coaster which strongly resembles the Mega Zeph. In 2019, rapper NF used parts of the park for his music video for \\"Leave Me Alone.\\" = Dreamlanding Festival Park (2016‚Äì18) = In 2016, a group that included the former head of Southern Star came together to form \\"Dreamlanding Festival Park\\" in order to buy and rebuild this park, pending city council/mayoral approval. According to their website, the group was ready to spend over $100 million to re-open the park, with construction scheduled to begin in the summer of 2018, a stated opening date of 2019 and more coasters ready for 2020. At the same time, a waterpark would open in spring 2019. A festival park and an RV site were also in their plans as they awaited the city's approval to purchase the park. In 2018, on the Dreamlanding Festival Park website, the following statement was released: \\"It is very hard to walk away from all the time and efforts we have put into New Orleans but in truth the old Jazzland /Six Flags park has now reached a point of no return. On our last inspection and after further review we find that the Rides that were savable as well as the majority of buildings are no longer economically viable to salvage.\\" =Jazzland Paidia Company (2011‚Äìpresent)= The Six Flags New Orleans sign still being displayed as of May 2019. In 2011, eight groups, including the Paidia Company, responded to an RFP issued by the Mayor's office. Paidia proposed to re-open the park as Jazzland, the park's name until 2002. The company was not selected during the first RFP. A second RFP was issued in January 2014. Jazzland submitted the only proposal. The plans include newly designed themes for the park, a new Baritone Beach water park, Sportsman's Paradise Resort Hotel and a mixed-use retail/dining/entertainment area. A few rides would be rebuilt, but most would be new. A \\"Sportsman's Paradise\\" section would include the existing Jester coaster, the \\"Beach\\" would include Megazeph. Ozarka Splash would be rebuilt as a \\"sugar flume\\", using the state's sugar cane industry for its theme. In February 2017, the company submitted a purchase offer for the property. In May 2017, the IDB voted to turn over decision making power to the Mayor's office. In June 2018 the IDB renewed the cooperative agreement with the new Mayor, keeping the decision power with the mayor's office. Jazzland maintains its interest in purchasing the property.

The appellation is generally, but not only, applied to certain movements within Ashkenazic Orthodox Judaism, and used by some members of these groups as a self-reference. The term connotes the observance of Jewish religious law in a way that often exceeds its bare requirements. This not only includes the careful study of Torah, daily prayers, observing Shabbat and kashrut, and performing deeds of loving- kindness, but also many more customs and khumrot (prohibitions or obligations in Jewish life that exceed the requirements of Halakha). The term frum contrasts with frei (Yiddish and German for 'free'), which describes Jews who are secular or practice non-Orthodox observance, or \\"free from keeping the‚Ä¶ commandments.\\" Meaning Frum can be used in a negative sense for 'hypocritically pious', 'holier-than-thou', 'sanctimonious'; or in a positive sense for 'pious', 'devout', 'God-fearing', and 'upright'. The phrase frum and ehrlich captures the positive connotations of these words, to mean roughly 'upright' or 'righteous' (see tzadik). The question \\"is s/he frum?\\" asks whether the person is religious. Derived terms In Yinglish, frummer is used both as a noun for 'one who is frum', and as a comparative adjective, i.e. 'more frum'. The correct Yiddish comparative form of the adjective is, in fact, . Frumkeit describes the lifestyle of those who are frum. Frummer can also have a negative connotation, similar to chasid shoteh ('pious idiot'), which is how the Talmud (Sotah 21B) describes a man who sees a woman drowning, but refuses to save her, and says, \\"It is not proper to look at her, and rescue her.\\" A frummer in that sense is a person displaying a disproportionate emphasis on technical aspects of religion of one's daily life in a manner which actually violates the halakha in a specific case. (See Pikuach nefesh.) Another term with this meaning is frummie. A person who is frum from birth was born into a frum household and has remained observant. This contrasts with a baal teshuva (literally 'master of return'), a Jew who has become frum after a period or lifetime living a non-Orthodox lifestyle. Mode of dress head covering praying at the kotel, one wearing an additional spodik hat in the middle The New York Times defines the word frum as 'religiously observant'. For boys and men, covering the head is an identifier of religiosity. For women, being frum includes adherence to the laws of tzniut, such as modest dress covering the arms and legs. For married women, a head covering is another indicator.

Modern tank cars carry all types of liquid and gaseous commodities. Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities.  Description  It refers to material in either liquid or granular, particulate form, as a mass of relatively small solids, such as petroleum/crude oil, grain, coal, or gravel. This cargo is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car/railway wagon, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered \\"bulk\\") can be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry. The Baltic Exchange is based in London and provides a range of indices benchmarking the cost of moving bulk commodities, dry and wet, along popular routes around the seas. Some of these indices are also used to settle Freight Futures, known as FFA's. The most famous of the Baltic indices is the Baltic Dry Indices, commonly called the BDI.

Following the latter's death in 1936, Shcherbakov was transferred from his role as First Secretary to the lower role of Second Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Party Committee where he reported to Andrei Zhdanov. He was also a notable critic of Ivan Gronsky, the editor of the literary magazine Novy Mir between 1931 and 1937. He became First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Party Committee in 1938, a post he held until his death.World Statesmen.org During the German-Soviet War, Shcherbakov served as the head of the political directorate of the Red Army (with the rank of colonel general) in Moscow, and at the same time was director of the Soviet Information Bureau. According to Antony Beevor's book, Stalingrad, The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943, \\"One of the richest sources in the Russian Ministry of Defence central archive at Podolsk consists of the very detailed reports sent daily from the Stalingrad Front to Aleksandr Shcherbakov.\\" After suffering from years of alcoholism Shcherbakov died of heart failure on 10 May 1945, right after Victory Day, and the following year the town of Rybinsk was renamed Shcherbakov in his honour (its original name was restored in 1957). In January 1953, Tass announced that his death was hastened by Jewish doctors. This was the beginning of the Doctors' plot.

With a specific focus on rhetoric, some, such as Walter Ong, have suggested that the audience is a construct made up by the rhetoric and the rhetorical situation the text is addressing. Others, such as Ruth Mitchell and Mary Taylor, have said writers and speakers actually can target their communication to address a real audience. Some others, such as Ede and Lunsford, try to mingle these two approaches and create situations where audience is \\"fictionalized\\", as Ong would say, but in recognition of some real attributes of the actual audience. There is also a wide range of media studies and communication studies theories about the audience's role in any kind of mediated communication. A sub-culturally focussed and Marxism- inflected take on the subject arose as the \\"new audience theory\\" or \\"active audience theory\\" from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies during the 1980s.

This is a modern version of the hypodermic needle model. ;Uses and gratifications : People are not helpless victims of mass media, but use the media to get specific gratifications. ;Reception theory : The meaning of a \\"text\\" is not inherent within the text itself, but the audience must elicit meaning based on their individual cultural background and life experiencesJauss, H.R.

The audience actively selects what messages to pay attention to.Bauer, R. The Obstinate Audience: The Influence Process from the Point of View of Social Communication. The Zimmerman-Bauer study found that the audience also participates in the communication by influencing the message. Media effects Early research into media audiences was dominated by the debate about \\"media effects\\", in particular the link between screen violence and real-life aggression. Several moral panics fuelled the claims, such as the incorrect presumptions that Rambo had influenced Michael Robert Ryan to commit the Hungerford massacre, and that Child's Play 3 had motivated the killers of James Bulger. In the 1990s, David Gauntlett published critiques on media \\"effects\\", most notably the \\"Ten things wrong with the media effects model\\" article. Then, in the 2000s, he sought to develop new methods which would explore possible media influences using \\"creative\\" approaches, in which participants were asked to make things such as collage, video, drawings, and Lego models using metaphors.Gauntlett, David (2007), Creative Explorations: New approaches to identities and audiences, London: Routledge. Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies From the 1970s, researchers from the CCCS produced empirical research about the relationship between texts and audiences. Amongst these was The Nationwide Project by David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon. Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding model can be seen as the beginning of research into how audiences are active consumers rather than passive recipients.

This involves a broadening of the spiritual horizon through the formulation of a transpersonal ethic in which we do not only desire the best for all people but for all living beings. It is this aspect where worldcentrism is viewed as an expansion of sociocentrism where one focuses beyond self-needs to also extend care about the group, community, and society. The idea is that worldcentrism situates the positive aspects of egocentrism and sociocentrism in a larger context of concern so that consideration does not only include one's self or one's people but all peoples and all beings. Synonyms of worldcentric include global and planetary. There are also worldcentrists who maintain that living beings engage in autopoiesis (self-making, self-producing, and self-repairing), which renders these beings as ends-in-themselves and of equal ground value, in addition to whatever extrinsic or intrinsic value they possess. Wilber also sometimes refers to an ethical stage that is beyond the worldcentric, which he calls kosmocentric. In a kosmocentric awareness, one experiences a release of attachments of the gross realm and a radical recognition of evolutionary processes so that an individual is compassionately called to action and becomes capable of letting the gravity of outcomes go. Wilber used to associate these advanced ethical stages with mystical states, but since 2002 he has associated these advanced ethical stages with the development of complexity in the self-related lines of identity, studied by Susanne Cook- Greuter.

The yellowish nucleus was once the center of a normal spiral galaxy, and the ring which currently surrounds the center is 150,000 light years in diameter. The ring is theorized to have formed by a collision with another galaxy, which triggered a gravitational disruption that caused dust in the galaxy to condense and form stars, which forced it to then expand away from the galaxy and create a ring. The ring is a region of rampant star formation dominated by young, massive, hot blue stars. The pink regions along the ring are rarefied clouds of glowing hydrogen gas that is fluorescing as it is bombarded with strong ultraviolet light from the blue stars.

Biography  Chris Thompson in Br√∏nn√∏ysund (2008).Thompson was born in Ashford, Kent, England, but raised in New Zealand. His early musical experiences were whilst still at school with the band The Paragons that played at weekly church youth club dances. Later, as his talent became clear, the band was reformed as Dynasty with other musicians and achieved much local success on the New Zealand music scene. Thompson's last band in New Zealand was Mandrake, formed with university friends who played the Friday and Saturday night dances in and around Hamilton City. He went to Australia before returning to England in 1973 to pursue a musical career, eventually joining Manfred Mann's Earth Band in 1976. In 1978, he was featured in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, providing lead vocals for the song \\"Thunder Child\\". After several years with Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Thompson left in 1979 and formed the Los Angeles-based outfit Night, which enjoyed two hits during its lifetime. One of them, \\"If You Remember Me,\\" the unused theme song for Franco Zeffirelli's remake of The Champ, was initially credited solely to Thompson; later pressings of the single were credited to \\"Chris Thompson and Night.\\" (But this source gives lyric credit to Carole Bayer Sager for \\"If You Remember Me,\\" and the music credit to Marvin Hamlisch.) The song reached #17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #7 Adult Contemporary. It was a very minor hit in Canada (#91). After the band broke up in 1982, he rejoined the Earth Band. In 1980, he co-wrote and sang backing vocals on the track \\"No Stoppin' Us Now\\" with Patrick Simmons and Michael McDonald, on the Doobie Brothers' album One Step Closer. In 1983 he contributed vocals to Simmons' solo album Arcade as well as co-writing several of the tracks. In 1981, Thompson released his debut album, Out of the Night. This was followed by five more albums, most recently Won't Lie Down in 2001. In 1984, while functional lead singer for the re-formed Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Thompson lent lead vocals to \\"Runner,\\" which slowly climbed to become a USA and UK top 30 hit, propelled by then-hot MTV airplay. In 1986, Thompson was one of the four co- writers of the hit song \\"You're the Voice\\" - the others being Andy Qunta of Australian new wave outfit Icehouse, erstwhile Procol Harum lyricist Keith Reid and Maggie Ryder. He hoped to record the song in London but was turned down by record companies there who stated the song was \\"not commercial\\". He sent a demo to John Farnham, who had recently come off a five-year stint fronting the Little River Band. Farnham liked the song and agreed to record it for his forthcoming album, Whispering Jack. Farnham's release of \\"You're the Voice\\" was a worldwide hit, reaching top ten positions in many countries across the world. Also in 1986, Thompson sang vocals on a solo album by ex- Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. The album featured performances by artists such as Brian May (Queen), Pete Trewavas (Marillion), Ian Mosley (also from Marillion), and Bonnie Tyler. However, the album, entitled Feedback 86, was not released until 2002. In spite of his already busy schedule in 1986, Thompson still found the time to return to Manfred Mann for their new album, Criminal Tango, in addition to putting out some solo material. He recorded the song \\"It's Not Over\\" for the soundtrack to the film Playing for Keeps, and this track was also featured (with a slightly longer fade-out) on his new solo album, High Cost of Living, released later the same year. The following year, \\"It's Not Over\\" would be re-recorded by Starship, becoming a top-ten hit for the group. In 1989, Thompson recorded the single \\"The Challenge (Face It)\\" as the official theme song for the 1989 Wimbledon Tennis Championships. He co- wrote the song with Harold Faltermeyer. A year later, in 1990, Thompson worked again with Faltermeyer in writing the 1990 song for Wimbledon, Hold the Dream by Franzisca. Also in 1990, Thompson recorded the single \\"This Is The Moment\\" as the official theme song for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. In 1992, Thompson performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert as a backing musician, harmonising with respected backing vocalists Maggie Ryder and Miriam Stockley. He also joined The Brian May Band for their South American tour the same year. In 1995, Thompson performed \\"You're The Voice\\" in the Netherlands at the World Liberty Concert as the grand finale of the event. He also sang a studio version of it on the Alan Parsons The Very Best Live album (1995). In 2006 and 2007, he joined Jeff Wayne for a second time to tour as The Voice of Humanity in the live version of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds. According to the special features of the DVD Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds - Live on Stage, Thompson designed some artwork for the show. Thompson has been featured on several albums by artists such as Alan Parsons, Jan Hammer, Steve Hackett, Bonnie Tyler, Mike Oldfield, and Sarah Brightman, as well as providing backing vocals for Brian May of Queen, during his first few solo concerts in South America in 1992. Thompson has also been involved with the SAS Band (Spike's All Star Band) where he has performed numerous songs, especially from his repertoire with Manfred Mann's Earth Band.

Its bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm of this single-celled protist, by a luciferin-luciferase reaction in thousands of spherically shaped organelles, called scintillons. Physical characteristics N. scintillans is large for a dinoflagellate with a diameter of , though most are around . It has a ventral groove that holds a flagellum, an extension of the cell wall called a tooth, and a striated tentacle involved in ingestion that projects posteriorly. The flagellum does not move the organism, so the nonmotile N. scintillans depends on regulation of its buoyancy within the water column ‚Äì perhaps by controlling its cellular concentration of ions and ammonia. N. scintillans produces a string of mucus extending from the tip of the tentacle which then adheres to plankton and ascends rapidly through concentrations of its prey in the water column. Diet Long exposure image of bioluminescence of N. scintillans in the yacht port of Zeebrugge, Belgium N. scintillans is a heterotroph that engulfs, by phagocytosis, food which includes plankton, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, fish eggs, and bacteria. Diatoms are often found in the vacuoles within these single-celled creatures. These green nonfeeding symbioses can grow photoautotrophically for generations. Diatoms of Thalassiosira have been noted as a favored food source of these organisms. Distribution N. scintillans can be found widely distributed throughout the world, often along the coast, in estuaries, and shallow areas of the continental shelf that receive plenty of light, which promotes the growth of the phytoplankton that make up a large portion of the N. scintillans diet. Life cycle Noctiluca species are unusual among dinoflagellates in appearing to have a diplontic life cycle. \\"Blooms\\" N. scintillans populations can exhibit high concentrations due to high concentrations of the plankton on which they feed, which are likely due to environmental conditions such as well-mixed, nutrient-rich waters, seasonal circulation, and runoff from agricultural pollution. The glow produced by N. scintillans organisms can be perceived by humans as ghostly colored glow or bloom in the water, which appears when the water is disturbed. This gives N. scintillans the popular names \\"sea ghost\\" or \\"fire of sea\\". Bloom color partly derives from the pigments of organisms inside the vacuoles of N. scintillans. Blooms are often red in coastal areas of the North Sea. Green tides result from N. scintillans populations having green-pigmented prasinophytes (green algae, subphylum Chlorophyta) living in their vacuoles. N. scintillans does not appear to be toxic, but it feeds voraciously on phytoplankton, and while doing so, it accumulates and excretes high levels of ammonia into the surrounding water. This may add to the neurotoxins produced by other dinoflagellates, such as Alexandrium or Gonyaulax (syn. Lingulodinium) spp., that kill off other aquatic life in the area. Evolutionary development DNA sequence comparisons suggest that the closest relative of the genus Noctiluca is Spatulodinium. Spatulodinium pseudonoctiluca seems to be more closely related to N. scintillans than to other Spatulodinium species. N. scintillans is also placed within a classification scheme that has a class Diniferea, or Dinophyceae, which includes nonparasitic dinoflagellates that lack armor plating.

He mainly operated in the mountainous regions of Strandzha, Sakar and the eastern Balkan Mountains. During the feudal seditions in the Ottoman Empire, Stoyan (his nickname Indzhe comes from Ottoman Turkish ince, \\"slim\\") became the leader of a large gang of robbers. His band attempted to attack and rob the town of Kotel, but its inhabitants erected a three-metre high wall and drove them back. He later gave up robbing and began to patronize the poor Bulgarian population, according to one legend leading an insurrection in the early 19th century. In 1806 Indzhe moved to Moldova, where he enrolled in the local rulers' guard and continued to fight against the Ottomans, until dying in 1821 in the Battle of Sculeni. He is still remembered in Bulgarian folklore, and many folk songs honour him. The Bulgarian village of Indzhe Voyvoda in the Strandzha Mountain is named in his memory.

The name means 'flexible lizard' (Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒºœÄœÑŒøœÇ (') meaning 'bent' and œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ (') meaning 'lizard'). Description Restoration Camptosaurus is a relatively heavily built form, with robust hindlimbs and broad feet, still having four toes. Due to the separate status of Uteodon it has become problematic which material from the Morrison belongs to Camptosaurus. The specimens with certainty belonging to Camptosaurus dispar, from Quarry 13, have been recovered from very deep layers, probably dating to the Callovian-Oxfordian. The largest fragments from later strata indicate adult individuals more than long, and at the hips. The Quarry 13 individuals are smaller though. They have been described as reaching 6 meters (19.7 feet) in length and 785 ‚Äì 874 kg in weight.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Camptosaurus dispar.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. p. 219-221. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave an even lower estimate: a length of five metres and a weight of half a tonne.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 284 Earlier reconstructions, such as those by Marsh and Gilmore, were based on the skull of Theiophytalia and display an incorrect, more rectangular profile. The skull was in fact triangular with a pointed snout, equipped with a beak. Its teeth were more tightly packed in the jaw compared to other Morrison euornithopods. Museum curator John Foster describes them as having \\"thick median ridges on their lateral sides and denticles along their edges,\\" these features were similar to, but \\"more fully developed\\" than those in Dryosaurus. Camptosaurus teeth frequently exhibit extensive wear, which indicates that individuals in the genus had a diet of relatively tough vegetation. History of discovery Historical skeletal restoration by O.C. Marsh, with skull based on remains now referred to Theiophytalia On September 4, 1879 William Harlow Reed in Albany County, Wyoming found the remains of a small euornithopod. That same year Professor Othniel Charles Marsh described and named the find as Camptonotus, or \\"flexible back\\", from Greek Œ∫Œ¨ŒºœÄœÑœâ, \\"to bend\\" and ŒΩ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ, \\"back\\", in reference to the presumed flexibility of the sacral vertebrae. The holotype was YPM 1877, a partial skeleton. The genus was renamed Camptosaurus by him in 1885 because the original name was already in use for a cricket. In 1879, Marsh named C. dispar (type species of the genus) for material he received from his collectors at Quarry 13 near Como Bluff, Wyoming in the Morrison Formation and C. amplus based on the holotype YPM 1879, a foot found by Arthur Lakes at Quarry 1A. The foot was later shown to have belonged to Allosaurus. Throughout the 1880 and 1890s, he continued to receive specimens from Quarry 13 and in 1894 named two additional species: C. medius and C. nanus, based in part on size. Charles W. Gilmore named two additional species, C. browni and C. depressus in his 1909 redescription of the Marsh specimens. In the Morrison Formation, Camptosaurus fossils are present in stratigraphic zones 2-6.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. Outdated mount of a C. nanus skeleton at the AMNH, now thought to be a growth stage of C. dispar Then in 1980, Peter Galton and H.P. Powell in their redescription of C. prestwichi (see following), considered C. nanus, C. medius and C. browni to be different growth stages or different gender of the larger C. dispar, and therefore only C. dispar was a valid species. They also considered a skull, YPM 1887, in 1886 referred to C. amplus by Marsh, later confirmed by Gilmore, to belong to C. dispar as well. Gilmore had used this skull to describe the skull of Camptosaurus, but the specimen was recently shown by Brill and Carpenter not to belong to Camptosaurus. In 2007, they put it into its own genus and species, Theiophytalia kerri. Camptosaurus skeleton mounted in outdated quadrupedal posture, and with Theiophytalia skull, Natural History Museum of Milan Camptosaurus depressus was recovered from the Lakota Formation near the town of Hot Springs, South Dakota. It was described by Charles Gilmore in 1909 based on the holotype and only known specimen USNM 4753, a fragmentary postcranium, by the \\"narrowness or depressed nature of the ilia\\". Carpenter and Wilson (2008) referred this species to Planicoxa, as P. depressa, on the basis of similarities between its ilium and the holotype ilium of Planicoxa venenica. However, McDonald and colleagues (2010), and McDonald (2011) found that the horizontal postacetabular process of C. depressus is more likely a product of distortion. Therefore, McDonald put it into its own genus, Osmakasaurus. An additional species, Camptosaurus aphanoecetes, was named by Carpenter and Wilson in 2008 for specimens from Dinosaur National Monument. It differs from C. dispar in the lower jaw, shorter neck vertebrae, and straighter ischium ending in a small \\"foot\\" among other features. An analysis by Andrew McDonald and colleagues in 2010 suggested that like C. aphanoecetes is actually more closely related to more advanced iguanodonts (Styracosterna). It has been moved to the new genus Uteodon. Cast of a skull from Bone Cabin Quarry West, Wyoming While Marsh was describing Camptosaurus species in North America, numerous species from Europe were also referred to the genus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: C. inkeyi, C. hoggii, C. leedsi, C. prestwichi, and C. valdensis. C. inkeyi (Nopcsa, 1900) consists of fragmentary material, a dentary and articular from Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Ha≈£eg Basin in Romania. It is almost certainly a rhabdodontid and is no longer considered valid (nomen dubium). C. valdensis is a dubious dryosaurid, based on the holotype and only known specimen NHMUK R167, a poorly preserved left femur lacking the distal end. It is thus difficult to compare it to other dryosaurids, including the contemporary Valdosaurus canaliculatus. C. leedsi is probably a valid dryosaurid that has been moved to the new genus Callovosaurus. C. hoggii was originally named Iguanodon hoggii by Richard Owen in 1874 and was moved to Camptosaurus by Norman and Barrett in 2002.Norman D.B. and Barrett, P.M. 2002. Ornithischian dinosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous (Berriasian) of England. Palaeontology 68:161-189 It has since been transferred to the genus Owenodon. The remaining European species Camptosaurus prestwichii was recovered from Chawley Brick Pits, Cumnor Hurst in Oxfordshire in England. The fossil was found when a tramway was driven into the side of a hill. It was described by Hulke in 1880 as Iguanodon prestwichii, and then placed in its own genus Cumnoria by Seeley in 1888, but was soon sunk into Camptosaurus by Lydekker in 1889. However, Naish & Martill (2008), McDonald and colleagues (2010), and McDonald (2011) found that Seeley's original generic distinction was valid. Cumnoria has been recovered as a styracosternan, more closely related to advanced iguanodonts than to Camptosaurus dispar, similar to the case of Uteodon. Classification Marsh in 1885 assigned Camptosaurus to a family of its own: the Camptosauridae. Alternatively some authors considered it an early member of the Iguanodontidae. Modern phylogenetics has made Camptosaurus by definition part of the clade Ankylopollexia, of which group it would then be a basal member. This would mean that the genus is closely related to the ancestor of later iguanodontid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs and was more derived than contemporaries such as Dryosaurus, Drinker, and Othnielosaurus. In the 2010 and 2011 cladistic analyses of McDonald and colleagues, Camptosaurus was placed as follows: Restoration of six ornithopod dinosaurs, including Camptosaurus at the far left Paleobiology Camptosaurus dispar (blue) compared in size to a human and other iguanodonts Based on studies of other iguanodonts (clade Iguanodontia), scientists believe they may have been able to achieve running speeds of 25 km per hour (15 mph). A tiny 9 inch fossilized embryo, referred to Camptosaurus, was retrieved from Morrison Formation strata at Dinosaur National Monument in Utah.

Life Scottow emigrated to Massachusetts between 1630 and 1634 with his widowed mother Thomasina and older brother Thomas. He settled in Boston and was admitted to membership in the Old (South) Church in 1639. He married Lydia (surname unknown) in 1640, and they had seven children. He acquired considerable wealth trading with Acadia, dealing in waterfront property, and developing frontier settlements near Scarborough, Maine. In November 1658, William Crowne, proprietor of Nova Scotia, leased a portion of the colony to Scottow and Captain George Curwin (grandfather of Salem Witch Trials high sheriff George Corwin). He served as a captain in King Philip's War alongside pardoned pirate Peter Roderigo. He was survived by his wife and four children, three daughters and a son Thomas, who graduated from Harvard College in 1677.

This was less than two years after the infamous trials at Salem, which he addresses at length in his, Narrative of the Planting making this work an important contemporary source. Scottow again seems to come down on the side of presumed innocence and against the accusers whose testimony was fickle and inconsistent (\\"said, and unsaid\\").Scottow, reprint Coll. Mass. Hist. Soc (1858) p.313 He further blames a departure from the non-superstitious theology taught by Jean Calvin (\\"Geneva\\") and embraced by the earlier teachers:, \\"Can it be rationally supposed:? that had we not receded from having Pastors, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, and Churches doing their duty as formerly... that the Roaring Lion [the father of lies] could have gained so much ground upon us...\\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rKsyAQAAMAAJ&pg;=GBS.PA315 Scottow includes a tally, \\"...above two hundred accused, one hundred imprisoned, thirty condemned, and twenty executed.\\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rKsyAQAAMAAJ&pg;=GBS.PA315 WondersoftheInvisibleWorld-1693 In the previous decade, Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather, had both been industrious in New England's government and written several enthusiastic books on witchcraft. Scottow was also a close neighbor to one of the judges Samuel Sewall. In bringing the witchcraft trials to an end, Scottow seems to give credit to the relatively un-zealous leadership of the swashbuckling and non-literary governor, the native born William Phips \\"who being divinely destined, and humanely commissioned, to be the pilot and steersman of this poor be-misted and be-fogged vessel in the Mare Mortuum and mortiforous sea of witchcraft, and fascination; by heaven's conduct according to the integrity of his heart, not trusting the helm in any other hand, he being by God and their Majesties be-trusted therewith, he so happily shaped, and steadily steered her course, as she escaped shipwreck... cutting asunder the Circean knot of Inchantment... hath extricated us out of the winding and crooked labyrinth of Hell's meander.\\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rKsyAQAAMAAJ&pg;=GBS.PA318 Works * A Narrative of the Planting of the Massachusetts Colony (1694) (an 1858 reprint in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, volume IV of the Fourth Series, p 279-332) * Old Men's Tears for Their Own Declensions (1691) (Online edition, PDF) * Scottow edited and published a collection of early documents MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New- England, The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES (1696) (Online edition, PDF) containing materials by John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, John Allin, Thomas Shepard, and John Cotton. * Scottow is also credited with translating portions of an anti-Anabaptist or anti-Quaker work by Guido de Bres, La racine, source et fondement des anabaptistes ou rebaptisez de nostre temps (Rouen, 1565).

Teso refers to the traditional homeland of the Iteso, and Ateso is their language. Iteso is plural (two or more people from Teso), Etesot and Atesot are singular. Etesot is for male person from Teso and Atesot is feminine. Iteso are believed to have migrated from Abyssinia (Ethiopia). In Uganda, Iteso inhabit the districts of Soroti, Kumi, Katakwi, Amuria, Bukedea, Serere, Ngora, Pallisa, Kaberamaido, Tororo, Kapelebyong and Kalaki. Iteso are very generous and hospitable people. The cultural drink of Iteso is 'ajon' , commonly consumed in local ceremonies and social gatherings. They practice crop and animal farming and attach great value to land. History=Origins= Teso traditions relate that they originated somewhere in what is now Egypt in the area of Alexandra. They are believed to have descended from the Hebrew Joseph who had married a black Egyptian. Later when the Israeli slaves left Egypt for the promised land, the group followed the blue Nile river into Ethiopia. They then moved in a south easterly direction and settled in North Eastern Uganda, in what is now Karamoja. The word Karamoja lends itself into Karamojong which means \\" the old person is fatigued\\". Legend has it that either as a sect, a clan or of a similar tribal identity to the Karamojong, tt is from here that they obtained the name Iteso, a derivative word, meaning \\"graves\\". The oldmen--the Karamojong--- where concerned, perhaps even anxious that if these group of Karamojong moved on, they would die hence becoming \\"graves\\", from which the word \\"atesia\\" originates, and the tribal name, Iteso, took on. Some accounts indicate bible or scriptural influence where by the Iteso saw a land, part of the promise to Jacob, the grand son of Abraham, as a land divided by small rivers originating from the White Nile, theirs was the Upper Nile area. From the Ethiopian mountains is where they saw the land. They later migrated south West over a period of centuries. They are part of a larger group of Eastern Nilotic peoples(Ikatung'a,Oltung'a,Itung'a) which include; the Maa(Samburu and Maasai),Turkana of Kenya, Nyangatom of present-day Ethiopia, Karamojong and the Toposa of South Sudan. The Ateker further split into several groups, including Jie, Turkana, Karamojong and Teso. The Teso established themselves in present-day north-eastern Uganda and western Kenya near Mt.elgon, and in the mid-18th century some began to move farther south. During the course of this latter migration, conflicts ensued with other ethnic groups in the region, leading to the split of Teso territory into a northern and southern part. Teso warriors =Ugandan and Kenyan Teso= In 1902, part of eastern Uganda was transferred to western Kenya - leading to further separation of Teso. Northern Teso occupy the area previously known as Teso District in Uganda (now the districts of Amuria, Soroti, Kumi, Katakwi, Pallisa, Bukedea and Kaberamaido). Southern Teso live mainly in the districts of Tororo, Bugiri and Busia in Uganda, and Busia District in Kenya's Western Province. Uganda In Uganda, the Iteso live mainly in Teso sub-region, i.e., the districts of Amuria, Bukedea, Butebo, Kaberamaido, Kapelebyong, Katakwi, Kumi, Ngora, Serere and Soroti, but also in Bugiri and Pallisa, as well as in the districts of Tororo and Busia. They number about 3.2 million (9.6% of Uganda's population). Until 1980, they were the second largest ethnic group in Uganda. As of 2002 they were the fifth largest but this has remained questionable especially since there has never been any genocide that could have massacred more than a half of the Iteso populace. Most of the Iteso therefore contend that they are still the second largest ethnic group in Uganda. In fact the figure portrayed by UBOS is rather a political statement than an accurate recording of the Iteso in Uganda. Most Teso elites continue to argue that, since the national budget is disbursed based on population numbers, some individuals in government often manipulate these figures to suit their political interests and as such, as long as the current NRM government continues in power, the national population census figures can never be accurate but rather will continue to serve selfish political interests in order to justify why some areas in the country like Teso, remain poor and underdeveloped.2002 Uganda Population and Housing Census: Analytical Report (Uganda Bureau of Statistics) Kenya The Iteso in Kenya, numbering about 578,000, live mainly in Busia county. The Kenyan Teso people are an extension of their Ugandan counterparts in that they were merely separated by the partition of East Africa during the historic scramble and partition of Africa just like the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania and the Oromo of Kenya and Ethiopia. They are among the Plain Nilotic groups closely related to the Turkana, Karamojong, Toposa, Kumam, Lango and the Maa groups of the Maasai and Samburu. The prominent people in Teso include the current governor of Busia County, Hon Sospeter Ojaamong, Hon Albert Ekirapa, Ojamaa Ojaamong, Oduya Oprong, Pancras Otwani, educationists like Isogol Titus, Silvester Silver Omunyu and student leaders like Titus Adungosi,Odula Ongaria, Cyril Etiang, Meshack Patrick Emongaise, Samson Iliwa and Odeke Opama Silas Okatagoro(Information Scientist/ Teso Author). The Iteso people are located in Western Province of Kenya currently in Busia County which is in South of Mt. Elgon. In Busia county, they inhabit two subcounties currently, Teso North and Teso South Subcounties. Still, a large number of them inhabit parts of Bungoma and even Trans Nzoia Counties which are dominated by the Bukusu of the Luhya community. Teso people are the only Plains Nilotic people whose lifestyles underwent drastic changes. Having been pastoralists since time immemorial, these people are now the most successful farmers in both Western Kenya and Eastern Uganda. In recent years the people have changed much of their lifestyle. They used to exhume the dead after some time because of population pressure on their land and they no longer have bushes to dump the bones of people who died long time ago. Now they use cement graves‚Äîa sign that they have embraced new ways of dealing with the dead. They believe in one God (Akuj/amsabwa) and also in life after death.

Mack (born November 17, 1944) is a Senior Advisor to the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the former CEO & Chairman of the Board at Morgan Stanley, the New York-based investment bank and brokerage firm.  Early life and education  Mack was born in Mooresville, North Carolina, the son of Alice (n√©e Azouri) and Charles Mack. Mack's father's original family name was Makhoul; he came to the United States from Lebanon when he was 12 years old, following Mack's grandfather, who had arrived at Ellis Island in 1909. The family settled in North Carolina. Mack's father ran a wholesale grocery, clothing, and general merchandise store called John Mack & Son in Mooresville, North Carolina. The business occupied The John Mack Building from 1937 to the 1990s. Mack is the youngest of six sons. The family was Catholic. In 1968, Mack graduated from Duke University, where he attended on a football scholarship and majored in history. Mack's first job in finance was as a clerk at a small brokerage house during his junior year at Duke, after a cracked vertebra made it impossible for him to continue on his football scholarship.  Career = Morgan Stanley = Mack worked at several firms around Wall Street before starting his career at Morgan Stanley in 1972 as a salesman, and has since worked for the company for nearly thirty years. Rising steadily to positions of increasing responsibility, Mack eventually headed the firm's Worldwide Taxable Fixed Income Division from 1985 to 1992. In 1987, he became a member of the board of directors. In March 1992, he assumed responsibility for Morgan Stanley's day-to-day operations as chairman of the operating committee. He was named President of Morgan Stanley in June 1993. Mack served as president, chief operating officer and a director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. from May 1997 when the firm was created by the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, two of the world's leading financial services companies. In 2001, Mack left Morgan Stanley after a power struggle with Phil Purcell; Purcell became CEO of Morgan Stanley after the 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, of which Purcell was already CEO. = Credit Suisse = Six months later, in June 2001, Mack was hired as CEO of Credit Suisse, then known as Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB). Mack's time at Credit Suisse was marked much restructuring and by compliances issues created by Frank Quattrone's Technology Group. = Morgan Stanley redux = On June 30, 2005, Mack returned to Morgan Stanley as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, replacing Purcell. Mack was noted for stabilizing the firm and reenergizing its culture and client franchise, despite an economic downturn. Mack announced his retirement as Chief Executive Officer on September 10, 2009, which was effective January 1, 2010. In 2011, Mack retired from Morgan Stanley after more than 30 years as an investment banker. Former Co-President James P. Gorman succeeded him as CEO. = Kohlberg Kravis Roberts = In 2012, Mack joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as a Senior Advisor. = Rosneft = In 2013 Mack joined Rosneft, the Russian, state-owned, oil company that has BP as an investor of approximately 20%. In 2014 he announced his departure, shortly after the CEO Igor Sechin had sanctions imposed upon him by the US. Different reasons were given for his departure; Mack said his contract had only been for a year, while Rosneft spokespeople said he had decided to leave for personal reasons.  Insider trading accusations  In 2006, Mack was accused by former SEC investigator Gary J. Aguirre of insider trading. On October 5, 2006, the SEC recommended no action be taken against Mack. In late November 2006, Mack and Pequot were notified that the investigation had been closed and no action would be taken against them. Compensation While CEO of Morgan Stanley in 2006, Mack earned a total compensation of $41,399,010, which included a base salary of $800,000, stocks granted of $36,179,923, and options granted of $4,019,934. In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $1,235,097, which included a base salary of $800,000 and other compensation of $435,097. He did not receive any cash, stock, or options. In 2014, Mack defended the high fees paid to CEOs, saying on Bloomberg Television that the discussion of compensation was healthy, but that CEOs earn the rates. Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 Mack guided the firm through the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, building its capital position and overseeing the firm's conversion to a bank holding company. To stabilize the firm, he forged strategic alliances with China Investment Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Group and entered into a joint venture with Smith Barney, forming at the time the world's largest wealth management firm. During the crisis, Mack was advised by U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank Ben Bernanke to sell Morgan Stanley. He has stated that during negotiations he was under considerable pressure from the president of the New York Federal Reserve, Tim Geithner, to sell or merge Morgan Stanley to one of his competitors such as JP Morgan. Mack saw this as being contrary to the interests of Morgan Stanley shareholders and employees, similar to the demise of Bear Stearns in a forced sale to JP Morgan for $2 per share, (the deal was later revised to $10 a share), and insisted on finding other sources of financing instead.

The small restaurant overlooked Cala Montjoi, a bay on Catalonia's Costa Brava, and was described in UK newspaper The Guardian as \\"the most imaginative generator of haute cuisine on the planet\\". The restaurant was also associated with molecular gastronomy. The restaurant closed on 30 July 2011 and was reopened as a creativity centre in 2014.

Restaurant magazine judged El Bulli to be No. 1 on its Top 50 list of the world's best restaurants for a record five times‚Äîin 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and No. 2 in 2010. History The restaurant's location was selected in 1961 by Dr. Hans Schilling, a German, and his Czech wife Marketa, who wanted a restaurant for a piece of land he had purchased. The name \\"El Bulli\\" came from the French bulldogs the Schillings owned. The first restaurant was opened in 1964. The restaurant won its first Michelin star in 1976 while under French chef Jean- Louis Neichel. Ferran Adri√† joined the staff in 1984, and was put in sole charge of the kitchen in 1987. In 1990 the restaurant gained its second Michelin star, and in 1997 its third. El Bulli has published books on its development, menu and philosophy since 1993,elBullibooks ‚Äì Recopilaci√≥n de informaci√≥n sobre los libros publicados por elBulli (catalog). El Bulli. Retrieved 2010-09-16. in both large format, some including CD-ROMs, and small format for supermarket sales. Ferran Adri√†, Juli Soler, and Albert Adri√† published A Day at El Bulli in 2008. The book describes 24 hours in the life of El Bulli in pictures, commentary and recipes. Among the recipes included in the book are melon with ham, pine-nut marshmallows, steamed brioche with rose- scented mozzarella, rock mussels with seaweed and fresh herbs, and passion fruit trees. Anthony Bourdain described Albert Adri√†'s contributions thus: \\"His book is a shockingly beautiful catalog of his latest accomplishments here ... Pastry chefs everywhere‚Äîwhen they see this‚Äîwill gape in fear, and awe, and wonder. I feel for them; like Eric Clapton seeing Jimi Hendrix for the first time, one imagines they will ask themselves 'What do I do now?'.\\" Commercial products The kitchen at El Bulli Texturas is a range of products by brothers Ferran and Albert Adri√†. The products include the Sferificaci√≥n, Gelificaci√≥n, Emulsificaci√≥n, Espesantes and Surprises lines and are the result of a rigorous process of selection and experimentation. Texturas includes products such as Xanthan and Algin which are packaged and labeled as Xantana Texturas and Algin Texturas respectively. Xanthan gum allows the user to use a very small amount to thicken soups, sauces and creams without changing the flavour. Algin is a key component of the \\"Spherification Kit\\" and is essential for every spherical preparation: caviar, raviolis, balloons, gnocchi, pellets, and mini-spheres. Closure In 2010, Ferran Adri√† announced he would close El Bulli in 2012, due to the massive monetary loss it was incurring. He was quoted by The New York Times as planning to replace it with a culinary academy. He later denied the announcement, saying that The New York Times had misquoted him, and stated that El Bulli would reopen in 2014 after a two-year hiatus, as \\"initially planned\\" and would still serve food.Hanly, Catherine, ed. (22 February 2010). El Bulli will still serve meals when it reopens in 2014 . http://www.hot-dinners.com Hot Dinners]. Retrieved 2010-05-30. Adri√† later confirmed, in an October 2010 Vanity Fair article, that the restaurant would be closing permanently after July 2011. In 2011, their website stated: \\"On July 30th 2011 El Bulli will have completed its journey as a restaurant. We will transform into a creativity center, opening in 2014. Its main objective is to be a think-tank for creative cuisine and gastronomy and will be managed by a private foundation.\\"Notice on El Bulli's website. Archived April 2011. Anthony Bourdain interpreted the goal of the new El Bulli foundation to be an elite culinary and dining experience development workshop, hosting not only chefs but \\"architects, philosophers, [and] designers\\", and allowing them to \\"not just share [their] successes, but to share [their] mistakes or [their] process with the world as it's happening\\" by providing a forum to explore such concepts as \\"do we need a dining room?\\" Film El Bulli: Cooking in Progress is a documentary about the restaurant highlighting the iterative creative process that occurred behind the scenes. Directed by Gereon Wetzel, the film follows the creative team led by Ferran Adri√† through the whole 2008‚Äì2009 season. It premiered at the 2010 International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam. Somerset House In July 2013, Somerset House in London hosted an exhibition dedicated to the food of Ferran Adri√† and El Bulli. The exhibition looked back over the evolution of the restaurant's laboratory and kitchen. Multimedia displays examined the methods behind the creation of signature dishes and original sketches and hand written notes of the recipe creations were on display with plasticine models of the dishes that were served.

The school is one of six high schools in the Fayette County Public Schools district. Paul Laurence Dunbar High School is named after the 19th century African-American poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar, whose parents were from Kentucky.See the entries for \\"Matilda Dunbar,\\" \\"Joshua Dunbar\\" and \\"Paul Laurence Dunbar High School,\\" in the Notable Kentucky African Americans Database, University of Kentucky Libraries, Lexington, Kentucky.The school was opened in 1990. With an enrollment of over 2100, it is one of the largest public high schools in Kentucky, and was the largest during the 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07, and 2007‚Äì08 academic years.Enrollment reports from 2002‚Äì03 through 2008‚Äì09 are available from the Kentucky High School Athletic Association. It also houses the Math, Science, and Technology Center. The PLD student body, unlike that of most of the other schools named after Dunbar, has a substantial white majority, although African Americans and Hispanics make up roughly one sixth of the students. History The school name was part of a political deal made in 1965 with the city's African-American community. In the era of segregated schools, Dunbar High School, also named after the poet, was the city's lone surviving black high school (grades 10‚Äì12 of Douglass School had been shut down in 1963) and one of the main cornerstones of Lexington's black community. When Fayette County's schools integrated in 1967, Dunbar High was closed, with its students being bused to four previously white schools. Eventually, the county school board agreed that the next high school to open in Lexington would bear Dunbar's name, principally at the urging of the Rev. William Augustus Jones, Sr., senior minister of Lexington's oldest and largest black churchHistoric African American Churches: Lexington, KY CVB and a civil rights leader2001 Kentucky Civil Rights Hall of Fame whose five oldest children had graduated from Dunbar and embarked on careers of distinction.E.g., and To the board's credit, it kept its word, even though a full generation had passed since the original agreement. To keep the schools differentiated, the new school was given the poet's full name, rather than just the last name as with the old school. As an additional tribute to the old Dunbar High School, the gymnasium was named the \\"S.T. Roach Sports Center\\" for basketball coach Sanford T Roach, who led the school to a 512‚Äì142 record from 1942 to 1965, and is a member of the National High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. The new PLD adopted the original school colors of the old Dunbar High (which were red and black, but changed to green and white during the 1940s). The new high school did not, however, retain the former school's \\"Bearcats\\" mascot. A vote of the school's future students shortly before the school's opening favored \\"Bulldogs\\" and selected \\"The Victors\\", by Louis Elbel, as the basis of the fight song. The building of the original high school at 545 North Upper Street has since been converted to the Dunbar Community Center, which serves myriad cultural, educational and recreational needs for the city of Lexington. The Dunbar Community Center is operated by the city's department of Parks & Recreation. Academics Since opening, Dunbar has averaged more than 15 National Merit Semifinalists a year, with 71 in the last four years. Of the Class of 2008, 75% continued on to four-year colleges or universities, with another 17% attending two-year colleges or technical schools. As of 2017, Dunbar offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses in twenty subject areas.. In January 2019, Dunbar senior Rachel Seevers was named one of 40 finalists nationwide in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the nation‚Äôs oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors. Rachel is only Kentucky's fifth finalist in the last forty years. Her project also went on to win the Intel Young Scientist Foundation Award at the 2019 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), placing her second in the world. =Math, Science, and Technology Center= The Math, Science, and Technology Center, also known as MSTC, is a magnet program housed in Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. The program accepts 55 students each year, selected from the 2500 incoming high school freshmen in Fayette County. Many MSTC courses exceed the comparable AP curriculum. Many MSTC students have received perfect scores on both the SAT and ACT exams. MSTC graduates are each offered an average of 50 scholarships from different schools (valued at over 1 million), and have attended twenty of the top thirty universities and colleges in the country as ranked by U.S. News & World Report. =Academic team= The PLD academic team has won numerous, including Governor's Cup championships in 2000 and 2001.The Kentucky Association for Academic Competition Retrieved on March 17, 2010 In 2000, Dunbar's United States Academic Decathlon team won the state division for the first time and proceeded to nationals.

Dunbar's team began as a combination of travel and house league players in 2001, and are one of ten teams in the state of Kentucky. However, in 2002 the PLD Ice Hockey team went from being a \\"metro\\" team to a strictly all Dunbar student team with the help of PE/Health teacher Mr. Jonas. Dunbar ice hockey has played in both the \\"A\\" (varsity) and \\"B\\" (junior varsity) levels of Kentucky state hockey. Fine arts=Band= The Paul Laurence Dunbar band, currently led by director Brian Morgan, has won national acclaim; they are one of a handful of high school band programs to receive the Sudler Shield twice. The school's commitment to a quality band program was clear from the beginning, when Craig Cornish, coming away from three consecutive state marching band championships, and a 4th place Grand National Championship finalist band at North Hardin High School, was hired as director. In its second year of existence, Dunbar band won the 3A state championship. In 1998, then-assistant director Jeff Hood (who had also earned success and national acclaim as band director at George Rogers Clark and Beechwood) took over.

The current bridge is long and above the river. It is part of a private facility with an admission fee, and draws over 1.2 million visitors per year.  History  The bridge was originally built in 1889 by George Grant Mackay, a Scottish civil engineer and park commissioner for Vancouver. It was originally made of hemp ropes with a deck of cedar planks, and was replaced with a wire cable bridge in 1903. In 1910 Edward Mahon purchased the Capilano Suspension Bridge. \\"Mac\\" MacEachran purchased the Bridge from Mahon in 1935 and invited local natives to place their totem poles in the park, adding a native theme. In 1945, he sold the bridge to Henri Aubeneau. The bridge was completely rebuilt in 1956. The park was sold to Nancy Stibbard, the current owner, in 1983. Annual attendance increased, and in May 2004, Treetops Adventures was opened, consisting of seven footbridges suspended between old- growth Douglas Fir trees on the west side of the canyon, forming a walkway up to above the forest floor. Cliff Walk Capilano Suspension Bridge In June 2011, a new attraction called Cliffwalk was added to the park.  Incidents  In September 1999, a woman dropped her 18-month-old child with Down syndrome off the bridge. She claimed she stumbled accidentally and the child slipped from her grasp. The child was not seriously injured. The woman lost legal custody of her child to the child's father as a result of the incident. The woman took legal action against the owner of the bridge, her ex-husband and the Federal Department of Justice. The case against the owner of the bridge was settled in 2004. In 2006, a 300-year-old, 46-tonne Douglas fir tree toppled during a heavy snowstorm. The tree fell across the western end of the bridge. Park officials closed the bridge temporarily while repairs were performed. On June 6, 2010, a teenage tourist on a class trip from California climbed over a railing and fell more than from a fenced off viewing platform near the bridge. By the time rescue workers came to his aid, the victim was dead. The official RCMP finding was that the teen was under the influence of LSD at the time of the incident. On June 2, 2012, a 30-year-old tourist from Ontario died after falling near the bridge. Police say the victim was hiking through trails near the popular attraction when he climbed over a railing and fell to the riverbed below.  Popular culture  The bridge has been featured as a setting in episodes of several television series, including MacGyver, Sliders, The Crow: Stairway to Heaven, and Psych. In 1974, social psychologists Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron conducted a well-known experiment on the bridge. Men approached by a female researcher on the bridge were more likely to call her later than men approached on a more solid bridge across the river. Dutton and Aron argued that this supported the theory that the men were mis-attributing the arousal caused by fear to sexual attraction toward the woman. This research supported Stanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion. In June 2019, Korean Pop group NCT 127 created a video of their visit to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as part of the social media documenting their world tour NCT 127: The Origin.

He graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in 1935 and received his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1938. He worked for several New Deal agencies after graduating from law school and then served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, after which he moved back to the New York area, living in Scarsdale and working in Manhattan. In 1959, Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence. The U.S. Post Office confiscated copies sent through the mail. Rembar, working for Grove Press, sued the New York city postmaster and won in New York and then on federal appeal. Subsequently, he defended Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer and John Cleland's Fanny Hill the latter argued before the U.S. Supreme Court which played a major role in changing the nation's approach to obscenity. In 1968, he published a book documenting the trials called The End of Obscenity: The Trials of Lady Chatterley, Tropic of Cancer and Fanny Hill, which won a George Polk Award in journalism. In 1975, he published a collection of wide- ranging essays titled Perspective. In 1980 he wrote The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System, a general history of the evolution of Anglo- American law, written for the non-lawyer and non-historian.

The original name Schillerplatz was superseded in the early 1900s. It lies to the west of Konstablerwache with both squares linked by the Zeil, the central shopping area of the city.  The Hauptwache building  The former guard-house with a caf√© (front side) The Hauptwache plaza with the Kaufhof department store The Hole in the Hauptwache plaza Hauptwache in 1846, by William Fox Talbot (mirror image) The baroque building which gave the square its name was built in 1730. It was the headquarters of the city's Stadtwehr militia when Frankfurt was an independent city state (‚Üí Free City of Frankfurt) and also contained a prison. In the 18th century Frankfurt still had city walls and its own army. Until 1864 the place surrounding the building was called Paradeplatz reflecting its military function. In 1833 during the Frankfurter Wachensturm, the Hauptwache and the Konstablerwache were stormed in a failed effort by a small revolutionary force of native citizens, among others Gustav Koerner, and some people from different locations in Germany. When Prussia annexed the city in 1866 and took over military activities, the Hauptwache lost this role. The prison remained and the Hauptwache also became a police station. In 1904, the building was used as a caf√© and remains one to this day. It was the scene of the Hauptwache incident when French troops opened fire on students protesting against the French occupation of Frankfurt on 7 April 1920. Heavily burned in World War II bombing, it was reopened in a provisional form with an altered roof in 1954. In 1967, with the building of the U-Bahn tunnel through the city, it was dismantled so it could be moved and rebuilt over the new underground U-Bahn station. The plaza has undergone another major renovation when the S-Bahn station for suburban trains was opened in 1978. Today, Hauptwache station serves as one of the most important crosspoints of the Frankfurt public transport system. Eight of nine S-Bahn lines serve the station as well as six of nine U-Bahn lines.  The Plaza  The plaza has been reformed several times. Its current appearance is marked by a sunken terrace leading down to underground pedestrian area with shops and the public transport station. Frankfurters call the sunken area \\"das Loch\\" (). The plaza contains a number of different architectural styles. It is towered above and dominated by St. Catherine's Church.

About The Sealed Knot takes its name from the original Sealed Knot, a secret association aimed at the restoration of the monarchy, although the modern incarnation has none of the political affiliations of its namesake. Apart from reenactment, it is also involved in research into the history of the Civil War, and education (at the school or college level) about the same. History The Sealed Knot was founded by Brigadier Peter Young, who was a military historian and a Second World War veteran. The idea of the Sealed Knot re-enactment group started at a dinner party with a small group of friends on 28 February 1968 following the publication of \\"Edgehill 1642 ‚Äì the Campaign and the Battle\\". Within a few months it had 200 members and today has a membership of several thousand, making it the largest re-enactment society in Europe. The group is a registered charity, and has its own coat of arms. With its large membership and high profile the Sealed Knot is the largest and best known of all the many re-enactment and historical groups and societies in the UK.The Sealed Knot Official Website, http://www.thesealedknot.org.uk/ Its official journal, Orders of the Day, is published every two months and sent to all members.

He led a successful legal battle to publish the uncensored version of D. H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and later was the American publisher of Henry Miller's controversial novel Tropic of Cancer. The right to publish and distribute Miller's novel in the United States was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1964, in a landmark ruling for free speech and the First Amendment. Early life Rosset was born and raised in Chicago to a Jewish father, Barnet Rosset, and an Irish Catholic mother, Mary (n√©e Tansey).http://dongxi.net/b11tR/print He attended the progressive Francis Parker School, where he was best friends with renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Rosset also said that Robert Morss Lovett, the grandfather of Rosset's high school sweetheart, and professor of English at the University of Chicago had been a great influence on him. Rosset attended Swarthmore College for one year and then enlisted in the army in 1942. It was at Swarthmore that Rosset discovered the work of Henry Miller.  Career  During World War II, he served in the Army Signal Corps as an officer in a photographic company stationed in Kunming, China. In 2002, Rosset exhibited a collection of his War Photographs from his time in China in a New York Gallery. The exhibit included graphic photos of wounded and dead Chiang Kai- shek soldiers. Rosset's initial ambition was to be a filmmaker like his childhood friend Haskell Wexler. Rosset produced a documentary called Strange Victory about racism in a post World War II America. The film was a failure. After divorcing his first wife, painter Joan Mitchell, Rosset took courses at the New School for Social Research and worked for Monthly Review Press magazine. A friend of Joan Mitchell's told Rosset about Grove Press and that the original founders wanted to sell. Rosset purchased Grove Press for three thousand dollars.  Personal life  Rosset married five times. Rosset married American Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell in France in 1949. The couple settled in Greenwich Village but then later divorced. Mitchell was instrumental in Rosset's acquisition of Grove Press. Rosset's second wife was Loly Eckert, a sales manager at Grove Press. They had a son named Peter Rosset. He owned an East Hampton, Long Island quonset hut, previously used as a studio by painter Robert Motherwell. His final marriage was to Astrid Meyers. Rosset had three more children after Peter, son Beckett (named for Samuel Beckett) and two daughters‚ÄîTansey and Chantal.  Grove Press and Evergreen Review writers  Rosset introduced American readers to numerous significant writers, including Samuel Beckett (Nobel Prize in Literature 1969), Pablo Neruda (Nobel Prize 1971), Octavio Paz (Nobel Prize 1990), Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (Nobel Prize 1994), Harold Pinter (Nobel Prize 2005), Henry Miller, William S. Burroughs, Khushwant Singh, Jean Genet, John Rechy, Kathy Acker, Eug√®ne Ionesco and Tom Stoppard. Interviewed by Tin House publisher Win McCormack, Rosset talked about publishing Beckett: : I had actually read a little bit of Beckett in transition Magazine and a couple of other places. I was going to the New School. My New School life and the beginnings of Grove crossed over. At the New School, I had professors like Wallace Fowlie, Alfred Kazin, Stanley Kunitz and others, who were very, very important to me. I was doing a great deal of reading and writing papers for them, and one day I read in The New York Times about a play called Waiting for Godot that was going on in Paris. It was a small clip, but it made me very interested. I got hold of it and read it in the French edition. It had something to say to me. Oddly enough, it had a sense of desolation, like Miller, though in its language, its lack of verbiage, it was the opposite of Miller. Still, the sense of a very contemporary lost soul was compelling. I got Wallace Fowlie to read it. His specialty was French literature. His judgment meant a lot to me even though he was so different from me. He was a convert to Catholicism, he was gay, and incredibly intelligent. He read the play and told me that he thought - and this before anybody had really heard about it much - that it would be one of the most important works of the 20th Century. And Sylvia Beach got involved in it somehow. She was a friend and admirer of Beckett. Waiting for Godot just hit something in me. I got what Beckett writing was available and published it. He flew into the web and got trapped. He had been turned down by Simon and Schuster, I found out, much earlier, on an earlier novel.McCormack, Win, \\"Literary Fly Catcher\\": Barney Rosset , Evergreen Review, 104. In an interview with the Brooklyn Rail, Rosset spoke about the Henry Miller's Tropic of Capricorn being taken to court for obscenity charges: : We had a case in New York and, of course, he [Miller] wouldn't go to the court. I had lunch with him at a restaurant on sixth Avenue right near here called Alfred's with our lawyer and three or four other people, and then we had to go to court. But he wouldn't go. He'd been summonsed so he was breaking the law by not going. So we went into court, and the District Attorney questioned me and said, \\"You see that we have a jury here of men and women with children who go to school right near where that book is on sale, near the subway stop. What'd you think they feel to have their children reading this book?\\" So I took out the book and started reading and the jury started laughing and they thought it was wonderful. I said to them, \\"If your children got this book and read the whole book you ought to congratulate them.\\" And they loved it, and they refused to convict me of anything. That was a great pleasure. Miller couldn't leave this country until the decision was in, verified and so forth. For at least a year or two years, he couldn't go. It was so funny because they accused me of soliciting him to write the book‚Äîwrite Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn‚Äîin Brooklyn, and at that point I was only 8 years old!

Andromachus was the son of Achaeus who was a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Anatolia. His family was influential in Anatolia and had strong royal connections.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.8 Andromachus had three siblings; one brother: AlexanderBillows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism p.110 and two sisters: Antiochis and Laodice I.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism p.110 Andromachus was the father of Achaeus and his sister Laodice II was married to the Seleucid King Seleucus II Callinicus.Polybius, IV. 51Polybius, VIII. 22 As a result of this marriage, the future Seleucid kings, Seleucus III Ceraunus and Antiochus III the Great, were his nephews. During the course of a war between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, the Egyptian king Ptolemy III Euergetes took Andromachus prisoner; and when Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, Andromachus was still a prisoner in Egypt. Since Achaeus was anxious to secure his father's release, Ptolemy IV of Egypt‚Äôs chief advisor, Sosibius, regarded the captive nobleman as a very valuable piece to play in the political game. He had, perhaps, before the revolt of Achaeus, tried to strike a bargain with him‚Äîthe release of Andromachus as the price for Achaeus deserting the Seleucid king. When Achaeus did revolt, pushed by other circumstances, and without having made any compact with Egypt, there was even less reason to let Andromachus go. Sosibius was very unwilling to part with such a valuable individual; but around 220 BC the Rhodians intervened on behalf of Achaeus, changing the situation radically. The Rhodians' decision did not spring from altruism. It was a move with which they hoped to defeat the city-state of Byzantium, with which they were at war. Byzantium hoped to gain Achaeus' support against Rhodes and its allies. By obtaining Andromachus' release the Rhodians planned to foil the Byzantine plan and obtain Achaeus' support. They therefore sent an embassy to Ptolemy IV asking him to deliver Andromachus to them. While Ptolemy at first refused to free Andromachus, with further consideration, being anxious to please the Rhodians, the king yielded to their request and handed over Andromachus to them. This was done, and father and son were reunited. After these events, Andromachus disappears from history.Polybius, IV. 51 NotesReferences *Bevan, Edwyn R.; The House of Ptolemy, London, (1927), chapter 7 *Billows, R. A.

Mid-1980s In the mid-1980s, Nanjing Auto purchased designs and moulds from Isuzu and obtained technology from the Italian Iveco, the commercial vehicle unit of Fiat, participating in a spate of technology transfer deals circa 1980 that saw Japanese designs and machinery sold to Chinese buyers.Globalization of the automobile industry: the United States, Japan, and the People's Republic of China Pg. 140 By Xiaohua Yang, Google Book Search, 1995 The Iveco purchases allowed Nanjing Auto to produce a version of the Iveco Daily. 2000s In 2000 the design, and possibly the tooling, for SEAT's first generation Ibiza was purchased and the car sold in China as the Nanjing Yuejin Soyat.SEAT Ibiza celebrates 25th Anniversary seatcupra.net, Friday, 08 May 2009 =MG Rover=Acquisition of MG Rover Group assets Nanjing Auto acquired some assets of MG Rover Group and Powertrain Ltd in 2005 after the group had entered administration. According to the purchase agreement, Nanjing Auto bought MG, Austin, and some other dormant British car brands, and the production technology and equipment for the MG ZT and MG TF models. Some equipment and blueprints were repossessed by Honda, as its intellectual property is used in some of MG Rover vehicles, in particular, the Rover 45 and MG ZS, which were based on the Honda Domani. MG production plan Nanjing Auto decided to establish production bases for MGs at Longbridge and Nanjing. A plan to open another factory in Ardmore, Oklahoma, USA was not realized. The production of engines, transmissions and medium and low end vehicle products would be transferred to China, where a supply chain would also be set up. A production facility would be retained in the UK, with the original Longbridge site integrated to resume the production of MG TF sport cars. Meanwhile, by making use of the R&D; capability and personnel in the UK as well as that of China, the Euro IV engines and a new generation of vehicles would be developed and then produced in both China and the UK. In 2007, Nanjing Auto planned to build 13,000 cars based on the Rover 75 / MG ZT sedan, renamed MG 7. These cars would be mostly sedans (saloons), plus some MG 7T estate cars. It also planned 3,000 MG TF convertible sports cars. Pukou plant MG Foundation Laid The MG Factory of Nanjing Auto is located in the High-level New Technology Economic Development Zone in Pukou (a new district of Nanjing). The capacity of the Nanjing-MG Factory will reach 200,000 autos, 250,000 engines and 100,000 gear-boxes. The initial MG range consisted of just the MG 7 and the MG TF.Chinese plant rolls out first MG - BBC News. Retrieved 27 March 2007. Nanjing Auto also started production of the Rover Streetwise-based MG 3SW in 2008. Longbridge plant The plant at Longbridge was for many years one of the most important car making factories in Europe as well as the largest British-owned car manufacturing plant, making Austin cars for most of the 20th century. After the Abingdon plant closed in 1980, Longbridge was also from 1982 the home of MG and then of the Rover marque which gradually replaced Austin in the late 1980s. The site is owned by St. Modwen Properties which acquired in two deals in 2003 and 2004 for ¬£57.5 million and leased it back to MG Rover Group. A 33-year deal was signed in February 2006 between Nanjing Auto and St. Modwen Properties covering the lease of 105 acres (a quarter of the total area of the Longbridge plant) but including the two main car assembly plants, the paint shop and administrative offices at a rent of around ¬£1.8 million a year. ¬£10 million was estimated to be needed to reopen the factory. With the merger of Nanjing Auto and SAIC, ownership of the Longbridge plant became a SAIC controlled facility. =Chang Da= NAC Chang Da H9 in Shanghai Chang Da H9 rear with the SAIC and Nanjing NAC label Chang Da (ÁïÖËææ) is an NEV sub-brand of Nanjing Automobile and SAIC.

Life Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de trigonom√©trie rectiligne et sph√©rique, et d'application de l'alg√®bre √† la g√©om√©trie, 1813 He was born in Paris, and was raised in a poor family who still managed to obtain a good education for their son. Lacroix's path to mathematics started with the novel Robinson Crusoe. That gave him an interest in sailing and thus navigation too. At that point geometry captured his interest and the rest of mathematics followed. He had courses with Antoine-Ren√© Mauduit at College Royale de France and Joseph-Francois Marie at Coll√©ge Mazaine of University of Paris. In 1779 he obtained some lunar observations of Pierre Charles Le Monnier and began to calculate the variables of lunar theory. The next year he followed some lectures of Gaspard Monge. In 1782 at the age of 17 he became an instructor in mathematics at the √âcole de Gardes de la Marine in Rochefort. Monge was the students' examiner and Lacroix's supervisor there until 1795. Returning to Paris, Condorcet hired Lacroix to fill in for him as instructor of gentlemen at a Paris lyc√©e. In 1787 he began to teach at √âcole Royale Militaire de Paris and he married Marie Nicole Sophie Arcambal. In Besan√ßon, from 1788, he taught courses at the √âcole Royale d'Artillerie under examiner Pierre-Simon Laplace. The posting in Besan√ßon lasted until 1793 when Lacroix returned to Paris. It was the best of times and the worst of times: Lavoisier had opened inquiry into \\"new chemistry\\", a subject Lacroix studied with Jean Henri Hassenfratz. He also joined Societe Philomatique de Paris which provided a journal in which to communicate his findings. On the other hand, Paris was in the grip of the Reign of Terror. In 1794 Lacroix became director of the Executive Committee for Public Instruction. In this position he promoted √âcole Normale and the system of √âcoles Centrales. In 1795 he taught at √âcole Central des Quatres- Nations. The first volume Trait√© du Calcul Diff√©rentiel et du Calcul Int√©gral was published in 1797. Legendre predicted that it \\"will make itself conspicuous by the choice of methods, their generality, and the rigor of the demonstrations.\\"Ivor Grattan-Guinness (1990) Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800 ‚Äî 1840, ¬ß2.5.4 Lacroix: scientific educator, pp 113,4, Science Networks: Historical Studies v. 2, Birkh√§user In hindsight Ivor Grattan-Guinness observed: :The Traite is by far the most comprehensive work of its kind for that time. The extent of its circulation is not known and it may not have been very large...But it is as well known as any other treatise of its time, and certainly more worth reading than any other, especially for the emerging generation. In 1799, he became professor of analysis at √âcole Polytechnique. Lacroix was the author of at least 17 biographies contributed to Biographie Universalle compiled by Louis Gabriel Michaud. In 1809, he was admitted to Facult√© des Sciences de Paris. In 1812, he began teaching at the Coll√®ge de France, and was appointed chair of mathematics in 1815. When a second edition of the Trait√© du Calcul Diff√©rentiel et du Calcul Int√©gral was published in three volumes in 1810, 1814, and 1819, Lacroix renewed the text: :New material, recording many of the advances made during the new century, were introduced throughout the text, which was rounded off by a long list of 'Corrections and additions' and a splendid 'Table of contents'. In addition, the structure of the work was changed somewhat, especially the third volume on series and differences. But the general impression is still that the main streams and directions of the calculus had been amplified and enriched, rather than changed in any substantial way. During his career, he produced a number of important textbooks in mathematics. Translations of these books into the English language were used in British universities, and the books remained in circulation for nearly 50 years.For example, John Farrar's translation Elements of Algebra, 3rd edition, 1831 BostonS.F.

The novel was the first in the Ring novel series, and the first of a trilogy, along with two sequels: Spiral (1995) and Loop (1998). The original Ring novel sold 500,000 copies by January 1998, and 1.5million copies by July 2000. Ring was the basis for the Ring media franchise, including a 1995 television film (Ring: Kanzenban), a 1998 theatrical film of the same name (Ring), a television series (Ring: The Final Chapter), and two international film remakes of the 1998 film: a South Korean version (The Ring Virus) and an American version (The Ring).  Plot synopsis  After four teenagers mysteriously die simultaneously in Tokyo, Kazuyuki Asakawa, a reporter and uncle to one of the deceased, decides to launch his own personal investigation. His search leads him to \\"Hakone Pacific Land\\", a holiday resort where the youths were last seen together exactly one week before their deaths. Once there, he happens upon a mysterious unmarked videotape. Watching the tape, he witnesses a strange sequence of both abstract and realistic footage, including an image of an injured man, that ends with a warning revealing the viewer has a week to live. Giving a single means of avoiding death, the tape's explanation ends suddenly having been overwritten by an advertisement. The tape has a horrible mental effect on Asakawa, and he does not doubt for a second that its warning is true. Returning to Tokyo with no idea how to avert his fate, Asakawa enlists the help of his curious friend Ry≈´ji Takayama, an apparent psychopath who openly jests that he engages in rape. As soon as Asakawa explains the story, Takayama believes him, and insists on seeing the tape. Asakawa shows it to him and although Takayama remains cool and nonchalant, he agrees that there is a powerful aura around it, and asks Asakawa to make him a copy to study at home, which Asakawa does. Racing against the deadline, both men begin investigating the tape. By following the imagery from the tape, Ry≈´ji deduces that the rapid strobe seen during certain sequences show the recording device was \\"blinking\\". The duo then connect this, as well as the significance of certain tape images, and learn of Sadako Yamamura, a young woman capable of technopathic feats (such as projecting mental images onto televisions) who mysteriously vanished thirty years previously. Believing Sadako is connected to the tape, Asakawa also soon learns that, after carelessly leaving the tape in his home, his wife and infant daughter viewed the tape and now have seven days to live. Learning of an isolated sanatorium Sadako frequented when her father contracted tuberculosis, Asakawa arranges a meeting with Nagao Jotaro, a doctor at the now-closed hospital. Recognizing him as the injured man from the tape sequences, Ry≈´ji aggressively presses Dr. Jotaro for answers; the doctor, buckling under pressure, explains that he was infatuated with Sadako, and raped her in the woods near to the hospital. Infecting her with smallpox he unknowingly contracted, Jotaro was injured during a struggle (during which he learned Sadako was intersex), resulting in the doctor throwing Sadako into a nearby well before crushing her with rocks. Believing Sadako's rage and psychic powers resulted in the images projected onto the tape, Asakawa and Ry≈´ji head for the well where she was killed. Figuring the well is located beneath the lodge where the tape was located, the duo locates the well and Asakawa lowers himself inside, finding Sadako's remains. Recovering and giving her remains a burial, Asakawa passes his deadline, confirming his curse has ended. When Ry≈´ji dies of a heart attack the next day, however, the true nature of the tapes are revealed: Sadako's rage caused her psychic powers to combine with the smallpox virus in her body, creating a paranormal phenomenon that is activated when the tape is viewed. Demanding the viewer replicate the tape, the curse is propagated like a virus through tape copies, sparing anyone who copies it; since Asakawa duplicated the tape at Ry≈´ji's request, he now must make his wife and daughter do the same, lest they die. Characters * Kazuyuki Asakawa: The book's protagonist, he is a Tokyo newspaper reporter whose reputation was somewhat tarnished in the past in connection with a fad for UFOs and ghosts. He has a wife, Shizuka (the Vertical, Inc. English translation of the novel incorrectly renders her name as Shizu), and daughter, Yoko. * Ryuji Takayama: Asakawa's friend whom he enlists to help him solve the riddle of the tape. He was a doctor but later became a philosophy professor of a famous university due to the time the story occurred. Being of an odd mental disposition, and is also something of a genius, Ry≈´ji usually stated that the purpose of his life is to gaze at the end of humanity. Ry≈´ji also claims to be a rapist, although whether these claims are true or not is unclear, as it may be a hoax used to befriend the quiet Asakawa. He was actually a lonely person who struggled to live peacefully within society. Ry≈´ji has even more significant roles in the sequels Spiral and Loop. * Shizuka and Yoko Asakawa: Asakawa's wife and daughter respectively. When Shizuka unknowingly watches the cursed video with Yoko on her lap, they become Asakawa's primary motivation for solving the riddle of the tape. * Sadako Yamamura: The book's unseen antagonist who vanished thirty years ago; also the person behind the incident of the cursed tape. She was, in fact, intersex with special powers similar to ESP. She was said to be extremely beautiful. * Shizuko Yamamura: Sadako's mother, who possessed powers similar to her daughter's. She threw herself into the crater of Mt. Mihara after a demonstration of telepathy, which she failed due to the present reporters' ill wishes, and was branded a fraud. Adaptations Following the publication of the book several adaptations were made, including a manga adaptation of the novel which was released in 1996 by Kouhirou Nagai. In 1999, a second manga was made by Misao Inagaki which took elements from the novel, film and television versions of the Ring. ;Films *Ring: Kanzenban (1995) *Ring (1998) *The Ring Virus (1999) *The Ring (2002) ;TV Series *Ring: The Final Chapter (1999) ;Manga *Ring (1996) *Ring (2 volumes) (1999) ;Audio Dramas *Ring (1996) *Ring (2015) Differences between film and book There are many key differences between the Ring novel and the 1998 film adaptation. Most notably, Asakawa in the novel is a man named Kazuyuki, while in the film, Asakawa is a woman named Reiko (whose name may have been a nod to Kaoru Futami's girlfriend in Loop). Kazuyuki has a wife and daughter; Reiko is divorced (from Ryuji), and she has a son named Yoichi. Kazuyuki is a newspaper proofreader, demoted for reporter over a failed story about the supernatural involving Ryuji; Reiko is a TV reporter. * Ryuji from the book was a snarky wisecrack who enjoyed black humour, and even claimed to have raped three girls. Ryuji from the film was a stoical, somber grouch, and there was never anything in the movie about rape. * In the book, when someone who had watched the cursed tape reached day 7 (without having copied the tape and showed it to someone else), they die from a myocardial infarction (a heart attack). At the time of death, they will experience intense anxiety, and should they glance into a reflective surface, they'll hallucinate themselves as hideously deformed and aged. The cursed tape in the book is a psychically engineered instrument that transmits a virus (the Ring Virus) to those that watch it. In the film, Sadako emerges from the television to claim her victims. She apparently 'scares' them to death, or they die from exposure to her otherworldly shade. Obviously, the film takes a supernatural ghost-story approach, while the book works on a pseudo-science-fictitious medical-mystery approach. * The character of Okazaki does not exist in the book. * Sadako's powers and abilities differ between book and film. In the book, Sadako did possess nensha (psychic photography), and it was hinted that she had prenatural senses, clairvoyance, and mind control abilities. This is nothing compared to the Sadako in the films, who is tremendously powerful beyond all limits. Aside from nensha and clairvoyance, the Sadako from the movies possesses ultra-psychokinetic powers, teleportation, remote vision and travel, regenerative powers, healing abilities (used by the Good Sadako only; see the article on Ring 0 for more info), and even the ability to cheat death, in a way. Incidentally, Sadako from the books cannot kill people by simply willing it like film Sadako can. Book Sadako can evidently manipulate the Ring Virus at will, and psychically infect anyone she chooses. * The true villain of the books is not Sadako herself, it is the Ring Virus, which was created when Sadako's dying will and psychic powers were fused with the smallpox virus. The smallpox virus mutated into a conscious virus capable of spreading via psychic means. In the film, it is Sadako's vengeful shade that is wreaking havoc although it is worth noting that in the book the virus was born from a fusion of Sadako's hate towards society, her psychic abilities and the smallpox virus, despite it not being Sadako herself who causes people to die. * The cursed videotape remains a constant fixture in the Ring film franchise, while in the books, the curse evolves into other formats: from the tape, to the Ring Report, to the Sadako clones, to the Ring novel published by Asakawa's brother, and ends with the Metastatic Human Cancer Virus. * Ryuji did not have a hint of ESP intuition in the book, although it is hinted that Asakawa gains a minor form of psychic awakening after raising Sadako from the well. In the final section of the book as Asakawa bids farewell to Ryuji at a train station, Asakawa notices a pain in his chest and the faint smell of citrus (the same symptoms Shizuko was said to experience during a premonition). Also, Ryuji was never attributed with ESP but was said to have very sharp intuitive skills naturally and Shizuko herself states that all humans are endowed with a small amount of power. * Ryuji's genius and cognitive talents were never really emphasized in the film. * The cursed tape in the novel is far different from the one in the movie. The book-version was much longer and more complicated. Also, the tape in the book has a message at the beginning and the end. The message at the beginning is something along the lines of, \\"Watch until the end, you will be eaten by the dead...\\", of which Asakawa thinks to mean, \\"Watch until the end, or else you will be eaten by the dead....\\" He was probably wrong. The message at the end: \\"The one who saw these images is destined to die in one week at this time. If you do not wish to die, do what will be said from now on. That is...\\", the rest of the end message is taped over, and it isn't until the end that Asakawa realized that the rest of the message was about copying the tape and showing it to someone else. These messages were not in the tape in the movie. The line that says: \\"If you keep doing nothing but shoumon, boukon will come.\\" a.k.a. \\"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine\\" (, lit. \\"If you keep doing nothing but playing in the water, a monster will come for you.\\") is one of the lines uttered by the old lady in the book, while it's a subliminal message of the Towel-Headed Man scene in the film's videotape. There are, however, shared elements, such as the moon-like view of Sadako's murdered from the well which is in the beginning of the film tape and in the end of the novel tape, immediately before the final written message. * In the film, it is Sadako's father, Heihachiro, that kills Sadako by braining her with a machete and pushing her in the well (though it is later revealed that Sadako didn't die right away, and was actually alive for about 33 years in the well, dying only a year before the events of the first film). In the book, Sadako is assaulted and raped by a doctor working at the facility her father is being treated at (for tuberculosis), who then tosses her into the infamous well. In the book she starved to death in the well full with hatred (although this was not revealed in the book 'Ring'). * Sadako is intersex in the book. She has Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, meaning she has testes, rather than ovaries, but her body does not respond to testosterone. No mention of CAIS is made in any of the films, and presumably she is not intersex in the film. * Sadako in the book also had a younger brother that died during infancy. * In the book, an incident is mentioned where Shizuko (Sadako's mother) recovers a statue of En no Ozunu (an ancient ascetic rumoured to possess supernatural power) that had been tossed into the sea during the American occupation period. After she recovers the statue, her psychic powers are awakened. Incidentally, it is rumoured that En no Ozunu might be Sadako's actual father. Furthermore, in the films, it is hinted that Heihachiro might not be Sadako's true father, but that her real father was something inhuman. One scene in Ring 0 subliminally suggests that Sadako's father is the sea (or something from it). * In the film, Tomoko has her friend Masami staying over when she dies at the beginning. In the book, Tomoko dies alone. * In the film, Tomoko is last seen in the kitchen but her corpse is found in the closet in her room, with her mouth wide open. In the book, she is also last seen in the kitchen but that is also where her corpse is found, with her hands pulling her hair in fear. * In the film, the victims of the videotape die with their mouths widely open. In the book, they die of heart failure and most commonly appear pulling their hair in fear. * In the film, Reiko gets a hint of where the videotape could be located by the fact the urban legend points to the Izu peninsula and to the first four victims' photographs she obtains using Tomoko's receipt that show their faces blurred after a night in Cabin B4 on the Izu peninsula. In the book, the Cabin B-4 is on the South Hakone peninsula, part of the Villa Log Cabin resort, and the lead that takes Kazuyuki there is a Villa Log Cabin membership card found in Tomoko's room that she had borrowed from a friend of hers. * In the film, the cursed video is slightly over a minute long and starts at the very beginning of the tape. In the book, it is about 20 minutes long (according to Ryuji's breakdown list) and starts about 20 minutes into the tape (Asakawa says that at the end of the video, the tape is at 1/3 of its length, and it is a 120-minute tape). * In the film, the investigation starts the day after Tomoko dies and is prompted by the death of Tomoko and the existing urban legend about the cursed video. In the book, it starts a month later and is prompted by a taxi driver explaining to Asakawa about the death of Shuuichi Iwata who died while on his motorbike at exactly the same time Tomoko died. There is no urban legend in the book. * In the film, Sadako appears to Ryuji the day after he watches the videotape (but is not identified as such). This does not happen in the book but does in the 1995 TV movie. * In the film, Sadako appears to Ryuji when he dies, crawling out of the TV set. In the book, Ryuji merely sees a reflection of himself horribly aged in the mirror. However, in the 1995 TV movie, Sadako also appears, albeit not crawling out of a TV set, instead she merely materializes to out of thin air as Ryuji is slowly dancing with Mai Takano, and is only visible to Ryuji (we see it cutting to Mai's POV for a while and we see that the place where Ryuji seeks Sadako is empty). * The well in the book is a stone well that looks like a \\"pile of rocks\\", making in closer in appearance to the wells in The Ring Virus (1999) and The Ring (2002), than to the well in the 1998 film. * In the film, it's Shizuko that predicted the 1950s Mt. Mihara eruption. In the book, it was Sadako that predicted it. * In the book, Shizuko's public ESP demonstration involved predicting the out come of two rolling dice but she was unable to do it correctly because of the combined negative will of all the people present. Sadako, however, had much more powerful ESP and saw the dice, hence why the dice also appear on the cursed video. In the film, however, Shizuko has to predict the kanji written on a sealed piece of paper and write them down, and she actually does it correctly, but is branded a fraud for no apparent reason, and Sadako kills the reporter responsible for that, something that does not occur in the book. * In the film, the phone only rings at the Izu cabin, which leads Reiko and Ryuji back there. In the book it is initially not made clear but the Loop novel subsequently makes it clear that the phone rang for everyone. What leads Kazuyuki and Ryuji back to South Hakone is finding out, by means of Yoshino's investigation, and their interrogation of the man who raped and killed Sadako that it happened there, when in place of the Villa Log Cabin resort was still a sanatorium where Ikuma was being treated for tuberculosis. This is in turn prompted by Kazuyuki's intuition that to find Sadako they should work their way backwards from where Kazuyuki watched the tape, in order to find out why the tape appeared exactly there. And that was because their original attempt to work their way forwards from Sadako's birth reached a dead end because no one knew of her whereabouts after her disappearance from the Hisho Acting Troupe.

Traditional methods for combating pharming include: Server-side software, DNS protection, and web browser add-ins such as toolbars. Server-side software is typically used by enterprises to protect their customers and employees who use internal or private web-based systems from being pharmed and phished, while browser add-ins allow individual users to protect themselves from phishing. DNS protection mechanisms help ensure that a specific DNS server cannot be hacked and thereby become a facilitator of pharming attacks. Spam filters typically do not provide users with protection against pharming. Currently the most efficient way to prevent pharming is for end users to make sure they are using secure web connections (HTTPS) to access privacy sensitive sites such as those for banking or taxing, and only accept the valid public key certificates issued by trusted sources. A certificate from an unknown organisation or an expired certificate should not be accepted all the time for crucial business. So-called active cookies provide for a server-side detection tool. Legislation also plays an essential role in anti-pharming. In March 2005, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Anti-Phishing Act of 2005, a bill that proposes a five-year prison sentence and/or fine for individuals who execute phishing attacks and use information garnered through online fraud such as phishing and pharming to commit crimes such as identity theft. For home users of consumer-grade routers and wireless access points, perhaps the single most effective defense is to change the password on the router to something other than the default, replacing it with a password that is not susceptible to a dictionary attack.

It stars Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Ellen Burstyn and Scatman Crothers. It is one of several collaborations between Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson. The majority of the film is set in a wintry Atlantic City, New Jersey, with cinematography by L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs. The title alludes to the Marven Gardens in Margate, New Jersey as well as to one of the properties in the original Monopoly game, which was based on the streets of Atlantic City.Combs, Richard (September 1973). \\"The King of Marvin Gardens\\", The Monthly Film Bulletin, p. 193  Plot  David and Jason are brothers, the former a depressive living with his grandfather in Philadelphia where he runs a late-night radio talk show and the latter an extrovert con man working for gang boss Lewis in Atlantic City, where he lives with the manic-depressive Sally, former beauty queen and prostitute, and her stepdaughter Jessica, who entertained men alongside her mother. After no contact for eighteen months, Jason asks David to come to Atlantic City for an opportunity to \\"make our fortune\\". David arrives and, after he is bailed out of jail, Jason persuades him to stay on in his hotel suite with the two women. He explains his scheme for a casino in Hawaii and tells him that they will share the girls when they go there. Tensions grow among the four as Jason seeks unsuccessfully to involve a Japanese syndicate of investors in his plans. The skeptical David has no faith in Jason's plan, while Jason chides David for wallowing in his dark, lonely depressed life. Jessica is being groomed for a beauty queen career by Sally in another improbable scheme but develops a mutual attraction with Jason. Sally, increasingly neurotic over losing her looks, burns her glamorous clothes, cuts off her hair and throws away her cosmetics. Jason starts packing to leave for Hawaii and tells Sally that he is going with Jessica and that she cannot come. Sally threatens to shoot David or Jason and, when Jason mocks her, shoots him dead in rage and despair. David escorts his brother's corpse home to Philadelphia by train. Cast Notable imagery  The film has several surreal scenes, including a conversation on horseback between David and Jason and a simulated Miss America Pageant. The latter scene was filmed in the empty Atlantic City Convention Hall (now called Boardwalk Hall), which was at the time of its 1929 construction the largest clear-span covered space in the world. During the scene, Ellen Burstyn is shown playing the hall's historic pipe organ, which is the world's largest organ and reputedly the largest and loudest musical instrument ever built.Boardwalk Hall - Pipe Organs Production The King of Marvin Gardens was shot almost entirely on location in Atlantic City in the winter months of 1972. It is therefore of considerable historical significance as a visual record of the very last days of the city's \\"classic era\\" resort architecture. Many of the grand hotels shown in the film's exterior scenes were demolished during the next few years to make way for the new generation of casino-hotels that were built after the legalization of gambling. Filming took place only months before the vast Traymore Hotel was explosively demolished in April 1972, and the movie's main location, the opulent Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel was demolished in 1978 to make way for Bally's Atlantic City. The portion of the film depicting Philadelphia was shot in Toronto. The apartment the Scatman Crothers character, Lewis, occupied is located at Jarvis and Isabella Sts. It was an old mansion that had been converted to apartments. The title of the film (which was originally to be called The Philosopher King) is an ironic reference to the original version of the board game Monopoly, in which the main properties were named after locations in Atlantic City. This reference was also reflected in the film's original poster art. The film was one of several collaborations between Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson, which included the Monkees film Head (1968) and Five Easy Pieces (1970), which established both men as major figures in Hollywood. Dern and Nicholson had previously worked together in Psych-Out (1968) and The Rebel Rousers (1970). Scatman Crothers subsequently co-starred, with Nicholson in the lead role, in Milo≈° Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980). Co-star Ellen Burstyn had previously worked in the TV series Gunsmoke, in which Dern had also appeared, and would soon achieve worldwide fame with her starring role in William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973). The film was one of the few screen appearances made by Julia Anne Robinson (Jessica), who died in an apartment fire in Eugene, Oregon in 1975, aged 24. Reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \\"an original, individual, and often frustrating movie that takes a lot of chances and wins on about sixty percent of them.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also awarded three stars out of four, writing that \\"much of the film doesn't work\\" but it \\"contains three of the best performances of the year.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 27, 1972). \\"...Marvin Gardens\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times panned the film, writing that \\"Rafelson's kind of poetic realism, an accuracy in the treatment of unexpected settings, looked like quality to some in 'Five Easy Pieces' two years back. Now it looks like the most pretentious of clich√©s, a low-keyed but very empty bombast exploiting rather than exploring its themes of failed dreams and tawdry realities.\\"Greenspun, Roger (October 13, 1972). \\"Film Fete\\". The New York Times. 31. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a curious, stunningly cinematic, intricately structured, intensely atmospheric new film,\\" adding, \\"There seems no end to the season's really extraordinary acting jobs and 'Marvin Gardens' gives us five‚Äîcount 'em five.\\"Champlin, Charles (December 19, 1972). \\"5 Actors Monopolize 'Marvin Gardens'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Richard Combs of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote \\"Brilliantly constructed by Rafelson and screenwriter Jacob Brackman as a fable of imperfect lives in which nothing ever comes to fruition, The King of Marvin Gardens creates a fragmented, incomplete puzzle (with visual and verbal puns slyly hinting that there might be a key), a game in which no one finally sweeps the board.\\" The King of Marvin Gardens holds a rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/king_of_marvin_gardens See also * List of American films of 1972 ReferencesExternal links Review by Andrew Sarris for the Village Voice, November 9, 1972 *The King of Marvin Gardens: A Killing an essay by Mark Le Fanu at the Criterion Collection Category:1972 films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:1972 crime drama films Category:Films set in Atlantic City Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in Atlantic City, New Jersey Category:Films directed by Bob Rafelson Category:Films with screenplays by Bob Rafelson Category:1972 drama films ","title":"The King of Marvin Gardens"},{"id":"2289772","text":"The Maudsley Hospital is a British psychiatric hospital in south London. The Maudsley is the largest mental health training institution in the UK. It is part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and works in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. The hospital was one of the originating institutions in producing the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines. It is part of the King's Health Partners academic health science centre and the National Institute for Health Research (‚ÄòNIHR‚Äô) Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health. History=Early history= The Maudsley story dates from 1907, when once leading Victorian psychiatrist Henry Maudsley offered London County Council ¬£30,000 (apparently earned from lucrative private practice in the West End) to help found a new mental hospital that would be exclusively for early and acute cases rather than chronic cases, have an out-patients' clinic and provide for teaching and research. Maudsley's associate Frederick Walker Mott had proposed the original idea and he conducted the negotiations, with Maudsley remaining anonymous until the offer was accepted. Mott, a neuropathologist, had been influenced by a visit to Emil Kraepelin's psychiatric clinic with attached postgraduate teaching facilities in Munich, Germany. The Council agreed to contribute half the building costs - eventually rising to ¬£70,000 - and then covered the running costs which were almost twice as high per bed as the large asylums. The hospital also incorporated the Central Pathological Laboratory, transferred from Claybury Hospital, run by Mott. Construction of the hospital was completed in 1915. An Act of Parliament had to be obtained, that year, to allow the institution to accept voluntary patients without needing to certify them as insane. However before it could open, the building was requisitioned to treat war veterans. After the war it was returned to the control of London County Council and it finally opened as the Maudsley Hospital in February 1923. The first superintendent was psychiatrist Edward Mapother, while Frederick Golla took over the running of the pathology lab from Mott. Both were more sceptical of the Kraepelinian categories of diagnosis, and took a more pragmatic and eclectic view on causation and treatment. Psychiatrist Mary Barkas worked here between 1923 and 1927 in the children's department established by William Dawson. In the interwar period the Maudsley Hospital engaged in widespread experimentation with animal hormones, both in small doses to rectify supposed deficits and in overdoses as a shock therapy. Numerous psychoactive drugs and procedures were tried out, in what has been described as 'unconstrained experimentation'. One of those involved, as a trainee and then junior doctor, was the controversial William Sargant. The hospital's nursing staff comprised a matron, assistant matron, six sisters and 19 staff nurses with at least three years general hospital training, supported by 23 probationers and 12 male nurses. It had a good reputation for training nurses and some applicants even travelled overseas to train there. A report (held at Bethlem's Archives & Museum) from a nurse who trained at the Maudsley shows some of the work of a new trainee: \\"Apart from observation and simple treatment, nurses are trained in special investigations and therapy. They carry out many of the routine psychometric tests, help as technicians in the ward laboratories, and are instructors in occupational therapy\\". The Maudsley Hospital Medical School was established in 1924 and eventually became a well- respected teaching centre. In 1932, Mapother described it as \\"the main postgraduate school of mental medicine in England.\\" The Maudsley Hospital had initially struggled to secure funding from the Medical Research Council, and, to undertake further research and develop the Medical School, but a substantial grant was obtained in 1938 from American charity the Rockefeller Foundation. Originally, there was no provision for the treatment of children and the rapid growth in this patient population was unforeseen. A child guidance clinic was set up under the directorship of Dr William Moodie, the deputy medical superintendent, in 1928. The late 1920s and 1930s saw a rapid growth in the number of patients treated: this growth led to an ongoing building programme including a secure unit, completed in 1931, and an out- patients department, completed in 1933. =Links with eugenic research= Both Mapother and then deputy Aubrey Lewis supported involuntary eugenic sterilisation, unequivocally recommending it to the Brock Committee in 1932. Lewis was a member of the Eugenics Society and a 1934 chapter he authored is \\"remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers\\". With the spread of National Socialist (Nazi) laws in Germany from 1933, however, they decried the Nazi conflation of therapy and punishment, a move partly attributed to political and funding expediency. The Maudsley maintained its links with Germany, taking on both pro-Nazis and Jewish emigres through fellowships provided by the Commonwealth Fund and, after 1935, large scale funds from the American Rockefeller Foundation. Eliot Slater continued to visit Munich through the 1930s and contributed to academic festivities honouring Nazi eugenicist Ernst Rudin. During this time, Maudsley psychiatry developed a distinctive combination of practical experimentation and intellectual scepticism. Influential psychiatrist Aubrey Lewis became clinical director of the Maudsley in 1936. At the outbreak of the Second World War, and with the threat of air-raids, the Maudsley Hospital closed and staff dispersed to two locations: a temporary hospital at Mill Hill School in north London and Belmont Hospital in Sutton, Surrey. Staff returned to the Maudsley site in 1945 and three years later the Maudsley joined up with the Bethlem Royal Hospital to become partners in the newly established National Health Service (NHS). =Post-war= In the 1960s a group from the Maudsley Hospital attacked the use of lithium for mood disorders. The head, Aubrey Lewis, called it \\"dangerous nonsense\\", and colleagues published that it was therapeutically ineffective. Their objections have recently been described as 'poorly grounded' and having steered practitioners away from a beneficial agent. In 1999, the Maudsley Hospital became part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (\\"SLaM\\"), along with the Bethlem Royal Hospital. Services The trust manages one of the UK's few biomedical research centres specialising in mental health. The centre, managed in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, is based on the Maudsley Hospital campus and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Media In 2013 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (‚ÄòSLaM‚Äô) took part in a Channel 4 observational documentary entitled Bedlam. The final programme, \\"Breakdown\\", focused on older adults, including those admitted to the Older Adults Ward at Maudsley Hospital.

The MIS timescale was developed from the pioneering work of Cesare Emiliani in the 1950s, and is now widely used in archaeology and other fields to express dating in the Quaternary period (the last 2.6 million years), as well as providing the fullest and best data for that period for paleoclimatology or the study of the early climate of the Earth,Wright, 427, 429; Aitken & Stokes (1997), 9-14 representing \\"the standard to which we correlate other Quaternary climate records\\".Sowers, 425 Emiliani's work in turn depended on Harold Urey's prediction in a paper of 1947 that the ratio between oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 isotopes in calcite, the main chemical component of the shells and other hard parts of a wide range of marine organisms, should vary depending on the prevailing water temperature in which the calcite was formed.Wright, 427 Over 100 stages have been identified, going currently back some 6 million years, and the scale may in future reach back up to 15 mya. Some stages, in particular MIS 5, are divided into sub-stages, such as \\"MIS 5a\\", with 5 a, c, and e being warm and b and d cold. A numeric system for referring to \\"horizons\\" (events rather than periods) may also be used, with for example MIS 5.5 representing the peak point of MIS 5e, and 5.51, 5.52 etc. representing the peaks and troughs of the record at a still more detailed level. For more recent periods, increasingly precise resolution of timing continues to be developed.Aitken & Stokes (1997), 12; Wright, 429-431 Developing a timescale A store of core samples In 1957 Emiliani moved to the University of Miami to have access to core-drilling ships and equipment, and began to drill in the Caribbean and collect core data. A further important advance came in 1967, when Nicholas Shackleton suggested that the fluctuations over time in the marine isotope ratios that had become evident by then were caused not so much by changes in water temperature, as Emiliani thought, but mainly by changes in the volume of ice-sheets, which when they expanded took up the lighter oxygen-16 isotope in preference to the heavier oxygen-18.Cronin, 120-121 The cycles in the isotope ratio were found to correspond to terrestrial evidence of glacials and interglacials. A graph of the entire series of stages then revealed unsuspected advances and retreats of ice and also filled in the details of the stadials and interstadials. More recent ice core samples of today's glacial ice substantiated the cycles through studies of ancient pollen deposition. Currently a number of methods are making additional detail possible. Matching the stages to named periods proceeds as new dates are discovered and new regions are explored geologically. The marine isotopic records appear more complete and detailed than any terrestrial equivalents, and have enabled a timeline of glaciation for the Plio-Pleistocene to be identified.Wright, 431 It is now believed that changes in the size of the major ice sheets such as the historical Laurentide Ice Sheet of North America are the main factor governing variations in the oxygen isotope ratios.Andrews, 448 The MIS data also matches the astronomical data of Milankovitch cycles of orbital forcing or the effects of variations in insolation caused by cyclical slight changes in the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation ‚Äì the \\"orbital theory\\". Indeed, that the MIS data matched Milankovich's theory, which he formed during World War I, so well was a key factor in the theory gaining general acceptance, despite some remaining problems at certain points, notably the so-called 100,000-year problem. For relatively recent periods data from radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology also support the MIS data.Aitken & Stokes (1997), 12-13; Wright, 431-432 The sediments also acquire depositional remanent magnetization which allows them to be correlated with earth's geomagnetic reversals. For older core samples, individual annual depositions cannot usually be distinguished, and dating is taken from the geomagnetic information in the cores.Aitken & Stokes (1997), 10; Wright, 431 Other information, especially as to the ratios of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is provided by analysis of ice cores. The SPECMAP Project, funded by the US National Science Foundation, has produced one standard chronology for oxygen isotope records, although there are others. This high resolution chronology was derived from several isotopic records, the composite curve was then smoothed, filtered and tuned to the known cycles of the astronomical variables. The use of a number of isotopic profiles was designed to eliminate 'noise' errors, that could have been contained within a single isotopic record.SPECMAP on NASA website Another large research project funded by the US government in the 1970s and 1980s was Climate: Long range Investigation, Mapping, and Prediction (CLIMAP), which to a large degree succeeded in its aim of producing a map of the global climate at the Last Glacial Maximum, some 18,000 years ago, with some of the research also directed at the climate some 120,000 years ago, during the last interglacial. The theoretical advances and greatly improved data available by the 1970s enabled a \\"grand synthesis\\" to be made, best known from the 1976 paper Variations in the earth‚Äôs orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages (in Science), by J.D. Hays, Shackleton and John Imbrie, which is still very widely accepted today, and covers the MIS timescale and the causal effect of the orbital theory.Cronin, 121-122, 121 quoted; PDF of paper Variations in the earth‚Äôs orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages (in Science), by Shackleton and others In 2010 the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy of the International Commission on Stratigraphy dropped other lists of MIS dates and started using the Lisiecki & Raymo (2005) LR04 Benthic Stack, as updated.

It is located on the confluence of the R√≠o San Diego and the Rio Grande (locally known as the R√≠o Bravo) bordering with the U.S. state of Texas. It had a population of 1,160 inhabitants in the 2010 census, and is, unusually for a Mexican municipal seat, the second-largest locality in the municipality, after the town of San Carlos (which had a population of 3,126). The town was founded in 1859. under the name of \\"Resurrecci√≥n\\" by captain Manuel Leal, and tejano expatriate families from San Antonio, Texas. History In June 1675 the area was first visited by Lt. Fernando del Bosque, on a reconnaissance expedition up the Rio Grande from the city of Nuestra Sra. de Guadalupe (Monclova). He was accompanied by the Franciscan Friars Juan Larios and Dionisio de San Buenaventura. The troop camped on the edge of the San Diego river, which the Indians called the \\"Nueces\\", very near the site of the actual town of Jim√©nez today. They met with two local Indian chiefs, Bacora and Pinanaca whose tribe, numbering 150 people, were on a buffalo hunting expedition. Del Bosque named the camp \\"Santa Clara de las Nueces\\". The area was again visited in 1729 by captain, Jos√© de Barroter√°n, who suggested a site on the San Diego river for a possible Presidio, but no attempt was made at foundation. In December 1735, Governor Blas de la Garza Falc√≥n and Joseph de Eca y M√∫zquiz selected an area on the banks of the San Diego river for a fort, and actually began cutting logs for its construction, but had to stop operations when they were ordered back to San Juan Bautista. In 1737, permission was given to captain Miguel de la Garza Falc√≥n, son of the governor who had died the previous year, to begin the construction of the presidio on the San Diego, arriving in October of that year with 50 soldiers and officers as well as 16 families for the new presidio which was named \\"Sacramento\\". The place turned out to be a poor choice as the land was difficult to irrigate, and after a brief two years it was moved to Santa Rosa, now Melchor Muzquiz, Coahuila. In 1773, a second attempt at another location on the San Diego river was attempted, this time the location was a small spring, tributary to the San Diego named \\"Aguaverde\\". The Presidio was completed and occupied by troops by late April 1773. This presidio and garrison lasted at this site for eight years, during which time it saw plenty of action against Indian attacks. In 1781 the garrison was relocated to San Fernando de Austria (now Zaragoza, Coah.), where the company still kept the name of Aguaverde, but the presidio was abandoned. It was not occupied again until the late 1840s and early 1850s, where the garrison of San Vicente was transplanted into the old Presidio. In December 1859, a group headed by captain Manuel Leal founded villa La Resurreccion, with families from the surrounding towns of Piedras Negras, Guerrero, Nava, Gigedo, as well as a group of families from San Antonio, Texas. The town was founded on lands previously occupied by the Colonia de Agua Verde. In February 1861 the village was attacked by a large force of Lipan Apache people. Some casualties were reported, among them was an old veteran of the Texas Independence and Texas Ranger, Damacio Galv√°n. The Lipans carried off some 500 head of cattle, as well as some children from the town. This fierce attack discouraged many of the settlers and the town's population diminished drastically, many of the families from San Antonio returned to Texas. During the mid to late 1860s, more settlers arrived from neighboring towns, and the town prospered. In 1875, the villa was renamed \\"Jim√©nez\\" in honor of Mariano Jim√©nez, a leader during Mexico's Independence movement. On September 26, 1906 the first armed rebellion against the dictatorship of Porfirio D√≠az, precursor to the Mexican Revolution began in Jim√©nez, it was led by Juan Jos√© Arredondo and Calixto Guerra, members of the Partido Liberal Mexicano of Ricardo Flores Magon. The movement was short lived as Federal troop reinforcements from Piedras Negras, surprised and dispersed the revolutionaries the next day at Hacienda Victoria. On June 24, 1908 another rebellion was attempted this time at Las Vacas (Cd. Acu√±a), by Benjam√≠n Canales and Calixto Guerra. After a day-long battle and heavy losses on both sides, the federal garrison prevailed and the revolutionaries were forced to retreat across the border into Texas. Geography Jim√©nez is located at , at an altitude of above sea level. Demography In the 2010 census the municipality had a population of 9,935 inhabitants. Climate The region of Jim√©nez has a hot, semi-arid climate. During the summer, the temperature averages (mean) between 79¬∞F (26¬∞C) and 88¬∞F (31¬∞C). The highest precipitation is typically recorded in May, June, September, and October, with an average monthly downfall in the range of 300 to 400 mm. Natural resources The region's main resources are agriculture and livestock. Education The municipality of Jim√©nez has a total of 33 primary schools, and 5 secondary schools.

Tomb statue l'Immortalit√© by Paul de Vigne; 19th century photo Paul de Vigne (1843‚Äì1901), Belgian sculptor, was born at Ghent. He created public monuments for display in Belgium and France. He was trained by his father, a statuary, and began by exhibiting his Fra Angelico da Fiesole at the Ghent Salon in 1868. In 1872 he exhibited at the Brussels Salon a marble statue, Heliotrope (Ghent Gallery), and in 1875, at Brussels, Beatrix and Domenica. He was employed by the government to execute caryatides for the ornate facade of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. In 1876 at the Antwerp Salon he had busts of Emmanuel Hiel and W. Wilson, which were afterwards placed in the communal museum at Brussels. Until 1882 he lived in Paris, where he produced the marble statue Immortality (Brussels Gallery), and The Crowning of Art, a bronze group on the fa√ßade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts at Brussels. His monument to the popular heroes, Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck, was unveiled at Bruges in 1887. At his death he left unfinished his principal work, the Anspach monument, which was erected at Brussels under the direction of the architect Janlet with the co-operation of various sculptors. Among other notable works by De Vigne are Volumnia (1875); Poverella (1878); a bronze bust of Psyche (Brussels Gallery), of which there is an ivory replica; the marble statue of Marnix de Ste Aldegonde on the Sablon Square, Brussels; the Metdepenningen monument in the cemetery at Ghent; and the monument to Canon de Haerne at Kortrijk.

Nicholson also wrote and co-produced the film.  Plot  A trio of cowboys, Vern (Cameron Mitchell), Wes (Jack Nicholson) and Otis (Tom Filer), stop to rest for the night at the remote hideout of a gang of outlaws led by Blind Dick (Harry Dean Stanton). In the morning, they find themselves surrounded by a vigilante hanging party and are forced to become fugitives due to a case of mistaken identity. Otis is killed. So are accomplices of Blind Dick, who is lynched. Vern and Wes take refuge at a farm belonging to Evan (George Mitchell), who lives alone with his wife and daughter, holding them hostage until they can make an escape. After a member of the vigilantes passes by, the two try to take Evan's horses and he shoots at them, wounding Vern before he is killed himself. Wes and Vern ride off together on one horse with the posse in pursuit. Eventually Vern can go no farther but holds off the posse until Wes can safely get away.

Keller as Roy  Production  Hellman said that Roger Corman had agreed to put up funds for a Hellman-directed western at a lunch meeting at the old Brown Derby on Vine Street, just south of Hollywood Boulevard, one of a small chain of famous restaurants in Los Angeles (the famous hat-shaped location was on Wilshire Boulevard). By the end of the lunch, Corman had allowed that since Hellman was making one western, he might as well make two ‚Äì presumably because, in the mind of the budget-conscious Corman, this would allow them to make two films for less than the usual cost. The films were made back-to-back, with The Shooting in production first. Hellman said that the crew and some cast members stayed on location, and, after taking a week's break, they began filming Ride in the Whirlwind. However, other than travel costs, shooting the two films back-to-back did not result in appreciable savings. Hellman stated that both films were made for under US$75,000 each (approximate total of $150,000 for two, provided by Roger Corman). Hellman and Jack Nicholson, who produced, wrote, and acted in Ride in the Whirlwind, and had a smaller role in The Shooting, had agreed that if they went over budget on either film, they would pay the overage out of their own pockets. Thus they were very careful to keep within the budget for each. The films were shot in Eastman Color in Utah, in an area that has since been filled in with an artificial lake. Parts of the film were shot in Kanab Canyon, Calvin Johnson Ranch, Paria, and Glen Canyon in Utah. Hellman said that producers would sometimes hire him to find out where he had shot the films, then fire him once they knew. He stated that he was the last to film there because it was filled with water soon after. Both Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting feature the same reddish low mountains with white lines in the rock (possibly water marks from a past age when the area was a sea or lake). Hellman said that he tended to cut out as much dialogue as he could. He preferred to tell the story visually. He avoided the obvious in terms of dialogue. Hellman stated that he oversaw the daily progress by the writers of the two films ‚Äì and that they rented an office in the Writer's Building in Beverly Hills on little Santa Monica Blvd. One personal thrill for Hellman was that their rented office was next door to Fred Astaire's.  Distribution  Hellman stated that both films were sold to a distributor who then sold them as part of a larger package of films to be shown on television. The films did play theatrically in France in 1969 and Hellman said they were hits, with The Shooting playing for a year in Paris and Ride in the Whirlwind playing for six months. Hellman stated that in the late sixties it meant a lot in Hollywood to be lionized in France and thus Hellman had a brief time of being very much in demand in Hollywood.  Thematic similarities  Both films involve a hunt. In the case of The Shooting, Nicholson is a hired gun and Warren Oates is a bounty hunter. Both men are working for a woman who is tracking someone. The entire film and the suspense is largely based on this mysterious hunt. In Ride in the Whirlwind, a posse that began by tracking a gang who robbed a stagecoach end up hunting down the Nicholson character and another man. Both films are considered acid westerns that express a rather bleak, minimalist quality that does not sentimentalize the Wild West. On the other hand, the violence is portrayed less graphically than, say, in the films of Sam Peckinpah like Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.

It consists of 28 episodes which originally aired in 1969 and 1970. It stars Peter Wyngarde as author Jason King (later featured in spin-off series Jason King), Joel Fabiani as Stewart Sullivan, and Rosemary Nicols as computer expert Annabelle Hurst. These three are agents for a fictional special department (the \\"S\\" of the title) of Interpol. The head of Department S is Sir Curtis Seretse (Dennis Alaba Peters). Production \\"When a case proves too baffling for the minds of Interpol, they turn to the talents of Department S.\\" ‚Äì from the ITC trailer for the series. The series was created by Dennis Spooner and Monty Berman, although neither wrote any of the episodes, which were instead scripted by ITC regulars such as Terry Nation and Philip Broadley. Many of the directors on the show had also worked on other ITC shows such as The Saint, Danger Man and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). The series was shot on 35mm film and designed, like all ITC's film productions, to fit the United States commercial format. Although episodes begin with a cold open (after the 'S' logo is shown), unusually, the episode title, writer and director credits appear on screen before the opening title sequence, though after the theme tune has started. With a few exceptions, the principal cast is always studio-bound. Some exteriors are represented by studio buildings, while the rest are mainly shown in second-unit footage using doubles where necessary. Outside locations were, in common with similar series, largely restricted to the Hertfordshire countryside in the vicinity of Borehamwood. At least one foreign location was used, featuring Peter Wyngarde on the streets of Vienna. Otherwise, foreign locations are usually established by the use of stock footage. To further cut costs, the series was produced back-to-back with Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). Synopsis Department S is a division of Interpol headed by international bureaucrat Sir Curtis Seretse (Dennis Alaba Peters). Its headquarters is in Paris (Interpol's headquarters has been located in Lyon since 1989) and its members investigate international cases that other crime agencies cannot solve. The team itself is led by American and former FBI agent Stewart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani), who takes direction from Seretse. Outside of his FBI experience, little is known about Sullivan except that he is pragmatic and hands-on, and does much of the leg- work, confronting the criminals. Jason King (Peter Wyngarde) is the ideas man, but also helps in the field. He is an adventure novelist who uses details from their cases to write his novels. The living he makes writing novels affords him a hedonistic lifestyle, and he is often seen with beautiful women though he has no permanent love interest in the series; in one episode he mentions he is a widower whose wife was killed in a plane crash. King also serves as comic relief in the series, especially in scenes of hand-to-hand combat where he winds up being subdued as often as he prevails. Annabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols) is a computer expert and analyst as well as a field investigator. A very attractive woman, Hurst sometimes appears in seductive, glamorous disguises. There are ongoing hints of romantic interest between Sullivan and Hurst during the series.

Biography Born in Bath, Somerset, England, of Italian ancestry, Semprini showed early talent for both the piano and cello. He graduated from the Verdi Conservatory in Milan in 1928, having studied composition and conducting as well as honing his skills at the piano. In Italy he performed a broad range of music, from pop to jazz and classical, and in 1938 led his first radio orchestra in Italy. In the late 1950s he also featured regularly at the San Remo Festival. Back in the UK, he hosted a light music programme, Semprini Serenade, which he introduced with the words: \\"Old ones, new ones, loved ones, neglected ones\\". The program first aired on BBC Radio in 1957 and continued for around 25 years. Although his 'house band' was the New Abbey Light Symphony Orchestra on his commercial records, on radio he was always accompanied by one of the BBC's own staff orchestras ‚Äì initially the BBC Revue Orchestra. Semprini also wrote a number of original light music compositions, including Concerto Appassionato and Mediterranean Concerto, which he used as the theme tune for his radio show. Recordings Semprini was a prolific recording artist. His work was first released on the Italian label Fonit Cetra, then EMI Records, where he remained for the rest of his professional career. Although strongly associated with light music, his recordings were principally of well-known classical music, including the Grieg Piano Concerto and solo pieces by Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Debussy. In 2015 Vocalion Records released a CD of his late 1950s broadcasts with the BBC Revue Orchestra, most of which had not been heard since their first broadcast. Popular reference In the Monty Python's Flying Circus segment known as \\"The Chemist Sketch\\", the BBC interrupted the show to ban a number of \\"naughty\\" words, including \\"b*m\\", \\"b*tty\\", \\"kn*ckers\\", \\"kn*ckers\\", \\"p*x\\" and \\"w**-w**\\" The final prohibited word, a puzzling and random addition to the list, was \\"Semprini\\". Immediately when the action resumed, the chemist (John Cleese) asked, \\"Who's got a boil on his Semprini, then?\\" and was quickly taken away by a policeman (Graham Chapman). For the rest of the episode, anyone saying \\"Semprini\\" was similarly arrested.

His real surname was Asimopoulos (ŒëœÉŒ∑ŒºœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ). Asimos was a very special case of a counter-culture artist, mostly because of his lifestyle. His behaviour and songs were often received as provocative by the general public. He was a person with strong political opinions. Ideologically, he could be categorised as an anarchist but he never accepted being put in a specific political ideology. Early life Nikolas Asimos was born in Thessaloniki. Both his parents were from Kozani. As a young man he was eager to learn new things. In 1967 he enrolled in the Philosophical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. During his college years he was often involved with theatre and the performing arts whilst writing songs and singing in various bo√Ætes of Thessaloniki. He often had problems with the police, particularly during the period of military rule ‚Äî junta ‚Äî in Greece and the consequent restriction on civil liberties, i.e., freedom of expression. Career In 1973, he moved to Athens from Thessaloniki; there he continued to be involved in theatre studies and graduated from a private theatre school. He wrote songs which were not recorded officially, but rather privately and on tapes that he would then sell on the streets of Athens. He performed in bo√Ætes around Plaka along with Yannis Zouganelis and Sakis Boulas, among others. His first official recording effort was in 1974 with the single Romios ‚Äì Michanismos (Œ°œâŒºŒπœåœÇ ‚Äì ŒúŒ∑œáŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ). In 1976, he had a daughter with Lillian Charitaki with whom he was not married. In 1977, he was temporarily imprisoned along with five other editors and writers. They were all released after an initiative by Dionysis Savvopoulos. In 1978 he was drafted into the Greek army but did not serve as he was relieved of duty for psychological reasons. He wrote a book titled Anazitontas Krokantropous (ŒëŒΩŒ±Œ∂Œ∑œÑœéŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ ŒöœÅŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒøœÖœÇ \\"Looking for Yolk-men\\") which was never officially published, but was circulated by him in photocopies. In his later years and after his death, the book was also made available by a publishing house. In 1982, he released his long play record titled O Ksanapes (Œü ŒûŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒ≠œÇ), \\"The Say-It-Again Man\\". In 1987, he was accused of raping an ex-girlfriend and was forcibly placed in a mental institution. Shortly after he was sent to Korydallos Prison and was later bailed out. He never managed to overcome his bitterness over this charge. The outstanding trial along with other personal problems affected his psychological state profoundly. After two failed attempts, he committed suicide by hanging on 17 March 1988 in his house which he used to call \\"preparation area\\". It is rumoured that he kept a diary during the last 15 days of his life in which he describes his efforts to find something worth living for in his life. He marked the pages with an \\"X\\" which meant that he had not found anything worth living for. The 15th day was also marked with an \\"X\\" which is the day he hanged himself. Production His Paranomes Kassetes (illegal tapes), as Asimos liked to call his early work due to its lyrical content, were recorded in friends' houses and other more or less inappropriate (concerning a recording session) locations, with several musicians accompanying him. The tapes had an underground distribution by Asimos himself or his friends, because he wanted to avoid his work being exploited by Record Labels. Apart from the tapes, he produced during his lifetime a 45rpm single with two songs and a full-length LP, as well as five compositions for a Vasilis Papakonstantinou record. The rest of his work was released after he died.

It is located about 7 km west of Spello and 9 km north of Bevagna. It is a low-key agricultural village: its main business is the growing of wheat and onions. Its railroad station is used for freight and does not serve passengers. As indicated by the etymology of the name (from canna, rushes), it is a medieval town, recent by the standards of the region, since in earlier times the site was underwater in the Lacus Clitorius that covered much of the area between Bastia Umbra and Foligno, and was only drained in the Middle Ages. At any rate Cannara is first mentioned in 1170 as insula Cannaio -- \\"the island of Cannaio\\"; the lake had not been completely drained yet. Main sights Its principal monuments consist in a number of small churches, among which the most important is probably the Church of the Buona Morte (also known as the Church of the Stigmata of St. Francis), which may be associated with the foundation of the Third Order by St. Francis of Assisi. In the territory of the comune, a shrine at Pian d'Arca commemorates the Miracle of the Birds of the same St. Francis; and the little hilltop town of Collemancio has two old churches and a ruined Roman settlement identified by some with Urbinum Hortense. Local events Cannara's main annual celebration is a Sagra in honor of the onion: the Festa della Cipolla. The week-long festival, featuring onion-based dining al fresco, draws over 10,000 visitors and is one of the best of the Umbrian sagre.

It is sometimes described as the farthest point from the eye at which images are clear. The other limit of eye's accommodation is the near point. For an unaccommodated emmetropic eye, the far point is at infinity, but for the sake of practicality, infinity is considered to be because the accommodation change from 6 m to infinity is negligible.

It depends upon the refractive error of the person's eye. For an unaccommodated hypermetropic eye, incident light must be converging before entering the eye so as to focus on the retina. In this case (the hypermetropic eye) the focus point is behind the retina in virtual space, rather than on the retina screen.

Merengue t√≠pico is the term preferred by most musicians as it is more respectful and emphasizes the music's traditional nature. The Instruments that are used are the accordion, bass guitar, g√ºira, conga, and tambora (drum) Introduction Merengue t√≠pico is the oldest style of merengue still performed today (usually in the Dominican Republic and the United States), its origins dating back to the 1850s. It originated in the rural city of Navarrete (villa bisono), northern valley region around the city of Santiago called the Cibao, resulting in the term \\"merengue cibae√±o\\". Originally played on the metal scraper called g√ºira, the Tambora, and a stringed instrument (usually a guitar or a variant such as the tres). Stringed instruments were replaced with two-row diatonic button accordions when Germans began to travel to the island in the 1880s as part of the tobacco trade. Later, the marimbula, a bass lamellophone related to the African mbira, was added to fill out the sound. \\"Merengue tipico\\" is very popular not only in the Dominican Republic but has migrated to the United States and many other countries. Early origins Merengue first appears in the Caribbean in the 1850s. The earliest documented evidence of merengue in the Dominican Republic are newspaper articles complaining about this \\"lascivious\\" dance displacement of the earlier tumba. Early merengue was played on stringed instruments, but the accordion came to the island in the 1880s, introduced by German traders, and quickly became the primary instrument in merengue. Up until the 1930s, the music was considered immoral. Its more descriptive and colorful name, perico ripiao (literally \\"ripped parrot\\" in Spanish) is said to have been the name of a bordello in Santiago where the music was played. Moralists tried to ban the music and the provocative dance that accompanied it, but with little success. Dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo brought accordionists with him on the campaign trail, and once he took power, he ensured that merengue was embraced as a national music by all classes of Dominicans.History of Merengue t√≠pico, http://merenguetipico.org =Controversy= The city of Navarrete is the exact origin of merengue tipico; the musician Nicol Lora, a native of the town, introduced it. Official versions promote the three-cultures origin, using the European accordion together with the African tambora and Taino guira. =Changes, Fusions, and innovations=1970-1980s After Trujillo's assassination, Dominican society changed rapidly as processes of urbanization and migration accelerated. Merengue tipico changed too. Through the efforts of artists like El Cieguito de Nagua, and particularly Tatico Henriquez, the music became faster and more technically demanding, while incorporating new instruments. They replaced marimba with electric bass, and added saxophone and congas. Hutchinson, Sydney. 2008. Merengue t√≠pico in transnational Dominican communities: Gender, geography, migration and memory in a traditional music. Ph.D. dissertation, New York University. The popularity of merengue overseas in New York during the 1980s caused a shift in the production of the genre in the Dominican Republic. The lyrics utilized less slang and language specific to Dominican dialects of Spanish to be understood by non-Dominican listeners. A shift to a faster rhythm for merengue performers also occurred, sparking a debate amongst Dominicans on whether the changes occurring should be considered merengue or another genre. Many feared too much international influence would change the style for the worse, losing the roots that made merengue popular to begin with. ‚ÄúNew Immigrants, New Layerings Tradition and Transnationalism in U.S. Dominican Popular Music.‚Äù Oye Como Va! Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music, by Deborah Pacini Hernandez, Temple University Press, 2010, pp. 77‚Äì105. 1990s‚Äìpresent In the 1990s a new generation of musicians added a bass drum, played with a foot pedal by the guirero, and timbales, played by the tamborero for fills (timbales in merengue tipico were believed to have been first incorporated by Ray \\"Chino\\" Diaz, a famous Dominican percussionist and tambora player). Agapito Pascual is credited with creating the new style termed \\"merengue con mambo\\" in 1987 with his recording, \\"La Vieja y su Pipa.\\" Merengue con mambo refers to a merengue with a second section based on hard driving rhythms and riffs played by the accordion and saxophone together. This is the dominant style today that has been further explored by artists like Ricardo GutierrezRicardo Gutierrez myspace page () El Prodigio, Geovanny Polanco, Raul Roman (son of accordion legend Rafaelito Roman), and Kerubanda.History of Merengue tipico at merengue- ripiao.com Artists like Krisspy and Aguakate have pushed genre boundaries even further with more mambo and fusions with other rhythms like reggaeton, and many artists like Fulanito have fused merengue-style accordion playing with rap music. A new crop of merengue musicians, notably Limi-T 21, have attempted to create an orchestra merengue and perico ripiao fusion on songs like \\"Que Lo Bailen\\". The bpm of the music has also transformed, originally between 130 and 140 [tempo], but today is sometimes sped up from 160 to 190 tempo. Rhythms Today merengue tipico actually consists of several different rhythms. Merengue derecho, or straight-ahead merengue, is the kind of fast-paced, march-like merengue Americans are most used to hearing. Pambiche or merengue apambichao is said to have developed during the American occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916-1924), taking its name from the \\"Palm Beach\\" fabric worn by American soldiers. Its tempo is usually slower than merengue derecho, and it can be recognized by the more syncopated rhythms in both bass and tambora. It is probably the rhythm most beloved by t√≠pico aficionados: dancing to it is said to require more skill since it is more complicated and syncopated than merengue derecho, and it helps to set the t√≠pico genre apart since it is used infrequently by orquesta groups. Guinchao is a third and more recently developed rhythm that is a combination of the other two. The once-common paseo, a slow introduction during which couples would promenade around the dance floor, is now common only in folkloric presentations. In the past, other dances like the mangulina, carabin√©, polka, guarapo, and zarambo were also played on accordion, but are now generally heard only at folkloric presentations. Merengue terminology In merengue, various slang is used to signify instruments, quality, the act of playing, etc. Below are a list of terms. *Botao- slang for a solo. Usually on tambora, g√ºira, accordion, or conga. *Guayo- means \\"grater\\", another word for the g√ºira instrument. *Mambo- not to be confused with the Cuban music style of the same name, \\"Mambo\\" in a merengue context can be either merengue de orquesta or merengue tipico, but a style of playing that involves heavy emphasis on conga, tambora, and cowbell riffs. Believed to be first popularized by accordionist Agapito Pascual, Merengue con Mambo sometimes involves solos, but is essentially a riff of saxophone or accordion repeating over a heavy rhythm. Most songs have a section within it dedicated to the Mambo, either nearing towards the end of the track or past the second verse of the song, but some songs are completely based on this style. Merengue con mambo is often played with a maco rhythm on the tambora, since it is can be played at a faster pace. The Pambiche rhythm is rarely used in merengue con mambo. Also can be used to shout out in songs, popularized by the likes of Geovanny Polanco, Aguakate, and El Prodigio. *Golpe- a rhythm for g√ºira, tambora, or conga. *Cuero- generally means cowhide in Spanish, but in merengue refers most of the time to a tambora skin. *Chivo- means goat, but refers to a goatskin for tambora. *Merengue derecho- \\"straight\\" merengue, the kind which most are familiar with. A simplified version is played in the first part of a two-part merengue. *Maco- borrowed from orquesta merengue, this tambora rhythm is essentially rim-slap-rim-open. Can be played the fastest. *Pambiche- is another dance similar to merengue, with a more syncopated tambora rhythm for which many variations exist.

He records with the bands Stars and Broken Social Scene, although he considered joining the band Metric before finally joining Stars. Musical career Early on, Cranley was in the band The Universe of Forums. In the 1990s, he was the trombonist for the Toronto-based band Gypsy Soul (later Gypsy Sol). He was also a part of Big Rude Jake's back-up band in the late 1990s (he later quit, stating there are only so many shows one can do dancing around in a flesh-coloured zoot suit with a trombone). Cranley was one of the original line-up of Broken Social Scene after the band was expanded from the core members Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. One of the songs on their first release, Feel Good Lost, is named after him (\\"Cranley's Gonna Make It\\"). He is a contributor to all Broken Social Scene albums in various capacities. In live performances with Broken Social Scene, he usually plays trombone or guitar. He was also a contributor to the original lineup of Canning's pre-BSS project Cookie Duster.\\"Broken Social Scene's Brendan Canning Reviving Cookie Duster Project?\\". Spinner, November 10, 2011. Cranley, along with Chris Seligman, is the main composer of Stars' music. The band was formed by Seligman and Torquil Campbell in the late nineties, and Cranley was approached to join the band when it expanded. (He was also approached with an offer from Metric, a band containing Broken Social Scene bandmates Emily Haines and James Shaw). Cranley and Seligman's compositional style is to repeat a riff or tune until something develops, and then Campbell and Amy Millan will write lyrics. He is most often seen playing bass and guitars during live performances. Cranley does string arrangement on the song, \\"My Favorite Book\\" and also does bass, guitars, percussion, mandolin and many other instruments for the band's album In Our Bedroom After the War, released in 2007. Cranley played various instruments on bandmate and wife Amy Millan's solo debut, Honey From the Tombs. Cranley has recently been involved with Montreal hip-hop act Da Gryptions alongside friends from the music scene. They released a single in the summer of 2010 that was an ode to the Montreal public bike system BIXI Montr√©al.

Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, she moved to New York City in 1959. She was director of Women's Studies and Professor of Performing and Creative Arts at the College of Staten Island, CUNY. She is highly regarded by critics and admirers, but her novels are less familiar to the broader public. She is best known for her stylistically bold novel Lover, published in 1976. She published two other novels, Catching Saradove (1969), and Confessions of Cherubino (1972). Lover was brought out by the Vermont based independent publisher Daughters, Inc., a small publisher of women's fiction. In all three novels, Harris engaged the aesthetics of late twentieth-century literature; they may be considered examples of literary postmodernism. Her novels are stylistically akin to the work of modernist writers such as Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, and Djuna Barnes (whom she greatly admired), and she has acknowledged as inspiration the work of Jill Johnston and the dancer Yvonne Rainer. She once proclaimed that Djuna Barnes's work was \\"practically the only available expression of lesbian culture we have in the modern western world\\" since Sappho. Much of Harris's work, most notably Lover, is written with the women's movement of the 1970s as its primary inspiration and its audience. Indeed, Lover might be viewed as a literary mother of queer theory; her novel resonates almost as strongly with third-wave feminism as it does with the second-wave feminism of its origins. Harris co-authored The Joy of Lesbian Sex in 1977 with Emily L. Sisley, and in 1995 she published Gertrude Stein, a biography for young adults. Lover was reissued in 1993 by the New York University Press with a new introduction by the author, mainly recounting her involvement with Daughters Press and its two owners. At the time of her death she was completing her fourth novel, a comedy, Mi Contra Fa. She died in New York City.

It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a self-preservation instinct while realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, which is managed through a combination of escapism and cultural beliefs that act to counter biological reality with more significant and enduring forms of meaning and value.Greenberg, J., Pyszczynski, T. & Solomon, S. (1986). \\"The causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem: A terror management theory\\". In R.F. Baumeister (ed.), Public Self and Private Self (pp. 189‚Äì212). Springer-Verlag (New York). The most obvious examples of cultural values that assuage death anxiety are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g., belief in afterlife, religion). However, TMT also argues that other cultural values ‚Äì including those that are seemingly unrelated to death ‚Äì offer symbolic immortality. For example, values of national identity, posterity, cultural perspectives on sex, and human superiority over animals have been linked to death concerns. In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g., country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells). Because cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for self-esteem. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values. TMT is derived from anthropologist Ernest Becker's 1973 Pulitzer Prize-winning work of nonfiction The Denial of Death, in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound ‚Äì albeit subconscious ‚Äì anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, religious meaning systems, cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural worldview. Adherence to these created \\"symbols\\" aids in relieving stresses associated with the reality of mortality. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety. Background Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973 book The Denial of Death that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.Becker, pp. ix‚Äìxiv. Becker expounded upon the previous writings of Sigmund Freud, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Norman O. Brown, and Otto Rank. According to clinical psychiatrist Morton Levitt, Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with sexuality with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.Levitt, Morton (July 1974). \\"Reviewed work(s): The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker\\", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 414, USA-USSR: Agenda for Communication, pp. 200‚Äì201. People desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in psychology known as self-esteem. This feeling counters the cognitive dissonance created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: The rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in Psychological Review proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health- promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: \\"Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.\\" =Evolutionary backdrop= Terror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the theory of evolution: Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human bipedalism confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers. Anxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential death anxiety in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective. Hunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror. Originally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, Neanderthals might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, funerals are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead. Evolutionary history also indicates that \\"the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development.\\" This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well- being. Self-esteem Self-esteem lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from Ernest Becker's conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971;Becker, Ernest (1971). The birth and death of meaning (2nd ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press. Becker, 1973Becker, Ernest (1973). The Denial of Death (1st ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain why we need self- esteem. One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview. Critically, Hewstone et al. (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem. In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self- esteem in a positive manner. Research has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health. Arndt et al. (2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts. Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them. Specifically, Arndt et al. (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise. In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message. =Self-esteem as anxiety buffer= An individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be diminishing returns from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self- consciousness. Conversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior. The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates cognitive dissonance regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause negative reinforcement that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality. Mortality salience The mortality salience hypothesis (MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self- esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e., returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS paradigm, these \\"threats\\" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g., asking participants to write about their own death; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries; having participants watch graphic depictions of death, etc.). Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS research, see Burke et al. (2010). Experimentally, the MS hypothesis has been tested in close to 200 empirical articles. After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs. a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg et al. (1994) for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS hypothesis, Greenberg et al. (1990) had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition. Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others. Mortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox et al. (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun. The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death, dealing with the fear of public speaking. Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that \\"bronze is beautiful,\\" one relating to the idea that \\"pale is pretty,\\" and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones. Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun- tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased. =Mortality and self- esteem on health risks= Studies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop et al. (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving. More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received. Overall, Jessop et al. (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities. Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality. Self-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior. Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages. People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking. In the Hansen et al. (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen et al. (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self- esteem. Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death. Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious. Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior. However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels. =Social influences= Many people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off. However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self- esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions. In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem. Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking. More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages. In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health. Death thought accessibility Another paradigm that TMT researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility (DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g., thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened. The DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg et al. (1994) as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e., the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by Wegner's research on thought suppression (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a) those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b) those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings. In these initial studies (i.e., Greenberg et al. (2004); Arndt et al. (1997)), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g., coff_ _ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g., sk_ _l as skill, not skull). If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death. =Importance of the DTA hypothesis= The introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror. It is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., nationalism, increased prejudice, risky sexual behavior, etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death- related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats (i.e., Heine et al., 2006) and that is death itself, and not uncertainty and lack of control associated with death; Fritsche et al. (2008) explore this idea. Since its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies. =Death anxiety on health promotion= How people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self- consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions. The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers. Due to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being cancer and heart disease, most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case). Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion. Terror management health model The terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life. According to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as breast self-exams (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death. While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat. Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the birthday effect, where mortality rates seem to spike around these days. On the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper et al. (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious. According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity. Cooper et al. (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE. Additionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem. The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors. In terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on: # The individuals' level of smoking-based self-esteem # The warnings' actual degree of death information  Emotion  People with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem. Leadership It has been suggested that culture provides meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when George W. Bush's approval rating jumped almost 50 percent following the September 11 attacks in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S. citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. Researchers Cohen et al. (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized compassion, trust, and confidence in others), and charismatic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the control group were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt et al. 2010). This has links to social role theory. Religion TMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious. Criticisms Psychologists, especially evolutionary psychologists, have argued against terror management theory. One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state. These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization. =Prevalence of death= Since findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in ‚Äì for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning. While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc. With regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to \\"linguistic or experiential connection with mortality\\" (p. 332). For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home ‚Äì many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures. =Meaning maintenance model= The meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety. In response, people concentrate on \\"meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity\\" and that such \\"meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures\\". These meanings, among other things, should \\"provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide\\". TMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, \\"different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions\\". For example, MMM theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September 11 attacks. TMT theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance. In sum, TMT theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence. As an example, TMT theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA. =Offensive defensiveness= Some theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved. For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach. Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown. TMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, \\"'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15 p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'....Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?\\" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant. In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty. For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant. Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film \\"Seven\\" (which contains a severed head). Though TMT theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under mortality salience. =Evolutionary psychology, coalitional psychology, and TMT= Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from evolutionary psychologists ‚Äì for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations. Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety. In response, TMT theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually. TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the future. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases. For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau et al., 2007. Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,). Coalitional psychology (CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats. People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group. TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP: * cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; * it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; * it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and * the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, * it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.  Replication failure  In addition to the criticisms from alternative theoretical perspectives, Many Labs 4 failed to replicate the mortality salience results. A large scale effort to test the theory failed to obtain support for the mortality salience effect on worldview defense, i.e. a greater preference for an essay writer adopting a pro-U.S. argument than an essay writer adopting an anti-U.S. argument. The test is a multi-lab replication of Study 1 of Greenberg et al. (1994). Psychologists in 21 labs across the U.S. re-executed the original experiment, among a total of 2,200 participants. In response to the Many Labs 4 paper, Tom Pyszczynski (one of the founding psychologists of TMT), stated ML4 \\"deviated from their pre-registered protocol and failed to mention these deviations\\" and further \\"failure to follow their (highly justified) preregistered protocol has led to incorrect conclusions that have become widely publicized and have inadvertently done more damage than good to our common goal of improving psychological science.\\"Chatard, Armand & Hirschberger, Gilad & Pyszczynski, Tom.

Early life Born Lawrence Buchanen English in Oregon, he soon received the nickname \\"Buck\\". The English family feuded with the Durbin family for years, which led to three of Buck's brothers dying. When Buck was thirteen, he became obligated to take revenge on the Durbin family. Unlike Black Bart, Lake County's other notorious thief, Buck was rash and openly flaunted his overconfident capacity. He was only 22 years old when he and a companion held up the Lower Lake stage coach and took the Wells Fargo strongbox from the driver. Instead of the usual gold or silver for the miners, the box yielded only two brass castings. The local newspaper later said, \\"Shortly before this robbery, he and his companion met four Chinese miners coming down from the Great Western Mine (near Middletown), and robbed them of their watches and money.\\" Territory Wells Fargo strongboxes were often the target of stagecoach robbers in Middletown. After the mid-19th century, the payroll money was brought in on the stagecoach with an armed guard beside the driver. Not all of the holdups in the area were the doing of Buck and his gang, although he was a scourge to the local vicinity for a number of years. Buck worked the road near Mountain Hill House, south of Middletown, or near the double bridge north of Middletown near Lower Lake. For 20 years, Buck roamed the countryside, making little effort to hide his identity or his disreputable enterprise. Duel Buck walked the streets of Middletown with a six-shooter strapped to his side, daring any who insulted his authority to a contest. One day, he ran into Captain Good on the main street, and harsh words were exchanged. Later in the day, they met again, and this time it was a shooting affair, with Buck emerging unscathed. The captain was seriously wounded in the arm and legs. In another unrelated incident, Buck shot and killed a man in the Middletown skating rink, turning the arena into a scene of pandemonium. After jail time After his release from San Quentin in 1882, Buck returned to Middletown. Soon after his arrival, the Lebree store in town was robbed of some watches and jewelry. Buck left Middletown for a few years, but upon his return, he showed he had not changed. It was not long before he held up the stage at the foot of Mount Saint Helena, near the summer home of the mayor of San Francisco. The six passengers were ordered out of the stage, and stripped of their possessions. Buck made no effort to hide his identity. He greeted the driver of a passing wagon, who quickly drove on when he realized a robbery was in progress. Capture This occurred on May 7, 1895. A posse was formed and they set off to capture Buck. They discovered him on a stagecoach going from Monticello to Napa, and a wild chase ensued. The San Francisco Examiner reported the next day: > One of the robbers jumped to the horses ahead and leveled his guns. He waved > weapons and spouted profanity, all the while threatening to \\"blow\\" the > driver off of the seat. The two robbers were armed with old style Colt > revolvers, and he cursed at everyone, especially the Chinamen The capture of Buck by Sheriff Bell reads like a Wild West novel. He was so badly wounded and had lost so much blood that many thought he would not survive. He did recover, however, and returned to San Quentin to serve yet another sentence. Buck was not as well known as Black Bart and other Western gunmen of the time, but he created fear wherever he went. Although he was arrested for his robberies and attacks on the general population, Buck had his hands in many other criminal activities, including cattle rustling, which he served less than a year in jail for. Later life Buck ended up living long enough to enjoy freedom again after his release from prison. He died in San Francisco on January 15, 1915 of natural causes, unlike his brothers, all of whom all died violent deaths.

It was General MIDI compatible and the sequencer was removed. There was also the subsequent Korg 05R/W half size 1U rack unit released in 1993. In spite of its name it was actually based on the Korg X3 and essentially served as a prelude to the X3's successor, the original Korg X5 keyboard that was released the following year. It was GM compliant and, while it didn't include a sequencer and had only half as many patches, it did include a serial interface for Mac/PC. Improvements over the M1 *254 sampled instruments in 6 megabytes of ROM (the M1 had 100 sampled instruments) (The T-Series has 8mb of ROM with about 190 sampled instruments) *The AI2 Synthesis produced much cleaner and perhaps slightly thinner sound and twice as many effects were available when compared with the M1 and T series. *Korg introduced a feature called Waveshaping. *The 01/WFD, 01/Wpro, 01WproX models had an internal 3.5\\" floppy disk drive that could read single-sided 720k floppy disks, custom Korg format. *The sequencer of The 01/WFD, 01/Wpro, 01WproX could hold up to 47 thousand notes, several times more than the M1 but less than the T-Series. *The polyphony was doubled to a maximum of 32 notes with 16 tracks/MIDI parts (as opposed to the 16 note polyphony and 8 track Sequencer of the M1 and T-Series). Key differences The 01/W only had a few of the M1's samples. Particularly missing were the M1 Acoustic Piano, and some of the M1 Electric Piano sounds. These were replaced by more realistic versions (the Acoustic Piano in the 01/W was radically different and sounded more oriented for classical music). The 01/Wpro even went a step further and added another even more realistic Acoustic Piano. The M1's piano was so bright and metallic sounding that it found its niche in Dance/Electronica and some Latin Music where it could cut through the mix easily. Korg acknowledged this fact by integrating their M1 piano back on later incarnations of the X range, such as in the X5D synth and N264/364 workstations. The 01/W also added more electric piano sounds, having at least 5 times as many, therefore becoming one of the standard keyboards used in smooth jazz, which often uses electric piano sounds. The 01/W introduced a feature called \\"Waveshaping\\". This was a feature where each sample value was run through a non-linear function, and thereby producing new harmonics. This is similar to the way a tube amp distorts sound. It was possible to select from 59 different waveshapes having names like \\"Rezzy\\", \\"Parabola\\" & \\"Comb\\", to transform/distort the sound. Waveshaping would add different harmonics to the sound depending on the selected waveshape, but the added harmonics depended also heavily on what kind of sample that was fed into the waveshaping function. The waveshaping feature could make some very interesting sonic textures as it would literally reshape the sound to fit that specific waveshape. However, the feature was discontinued on subsequent models. Original sounds were achievable but required significant experimentation, as using waveshaping on stock samples often only seemed to add distortion. The 0 series took a step backward from the T series in one area: the 1-megabyte sample RAM, on which users could load their own multisamples, was removed. More current workstations almost invariably have integrated samplers or user sample playback features. Sonic character The 01/W is also known for its \\"warmth\\". It has been suggested the 01/W sounded richer than the Korg synths that came afterward. The two most probable reasons for that are: * The 01/W's samples were recorded at 16 bit 32 kHz. Subsequent Korg synths had their samples recorded at 16 bit 44.1 kHz. The sample rate of 32 kHz limited the frequencies possible in any sample to below 16 kHz, instead of the 22.05 kHz of later synths by Korg. * More ROM memory was allocated to each sample than the synths following afterward (As an example, the 01/W used 6 MB of ROM to fit 254 compressed samples. The Korg X3 also used 6 MB to fit 334 compressed samples in its ROM) The fact that the 01/W's samples were recorded at a slightly lower sampling rate, therefore reducing sample size, plus the advantage of having more ROM memory meant that longer samples could be stored, possibly adding more realism to sustained sounds and so forth. The 32 kHz frequency might give the illusion of a more acoustic instrument, because it might be perceived as reducing the amount of high frequencies, which tend to be attenuated in physical/analogue instruments when compared to digital ones.

NGES had originally been created by Northrop Grumman's acquisition of Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group in 1996. The Electronic Systems sector was a leading designer, developer, and manufacturer of a wide variety of advanced defense electronics and systems. The division had 120 locations worldwide, including 72 international offices, and approximately 24,000 employees. Accounting for 20% of company sales in 2005,Northrop Grumman Corporation (2006), 2005 Annual Report it was the single largest sector (business unit) in the corporation. Organization Headquartered outside Baltimore in Linthicum, Maryland near the BWI Airport, Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems was organized into the following divisions: *Advanced Concepts & Technologies *Aerospace Systems *Naval & Marine Systems *Defensive Systems *Navigation Systems *Government Systems *Space & ISR Systems Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems provided airborne radar systems, secondary surveillance systems, inertial navigation systems and sensors, electronic warfare systems, precision weapons, air traffic control systems, air defense systems, communications systems, space systems, marine systems, naval systems, integrated avionics systems, and postal automation and information systems. Key products included active electronically scanned array fire control radars for the F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, as well as the Longbow Fire Control Radar for the AH-64 Apache helicopter. Other principal products included the AWACS radar, the Boeing 737-based Wedgetail MESA airborne early warning and control system, E-8 Joint STARS air-to-ground surveillance radar sensor, the Longbow Hellfire missile, the ALQ-135 radar jammer for the F-15 Eagle, ALQ-218 Tactical Jamming Receiver for the EA-18G Growler and EA-6B ICAP III Prowler, tactical military radars, countrywide air defense systems, Directional Infrared Counter Measures, sophisticated undersea warfare systems, and naval propulsion and power generation systems. History Electronic Systems' direct roots date to 1938, when Westinghouse Electric Corporation‚Äôs Radio Division moved to Baltimore, Maryland from Massachusetts and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1939, Westinghouse more than doubled its manufacturing area in its Baltimore location to accommodate production of the then highly-secret SCR-270 aircraft warning radar. In 1941, an SCR-270 radar detected the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor; its warnings went unheeded because of high- level uncertainty about the new technology's reliability. The first ground- based radar built for the Army Signal Corps, the SCR-270 proved to be the only model to stay in action throughout all of World War II. From 1941-1945 the Westinghouse Radio Division manufactured approximately 50 products during the war. Until 1942, most of this was radio equipment; later production shifted to radar products. Wartime production included ground-based and naval radio and radar, electronic fuses, and torpedoes. In 1953, the unit patented key technologies for Pulse-Doppler radar, making possible airborne systems that can detect both stationary and moving targets, determine range, and distinguish targets from background \\"clutter.\\" Pulse-Doppler is the basis for all airborne radars in use today. By 1966, the division designed and developed a miniaturized black-and-white camera that captured images from the Project Apollo Lunar Module that landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. In 1967, The world's first solid-state radar, the AN/APQ-120 for the F-4 Phantom II fighter, was produced by the division. In 1947, Westinghouse acquired Joshua Hendy Iron Works. In 1974, the division began development of the AN/APG-66 radar for the F-16; the unit has produced over 6,000 radars for various versions of the F-16. In 1976, Westinghouse Electronic Systems delivered the first E-3 Sentry AWACS long-range airborne surveillance radar. In 1996, Westinghouse was selected to design, build and test the radar for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, what became the AN/APG-81. =Expansion within Northrop Grumman= Electronic Systems was central to Northrop Grumman's aggressive merger and acquisition strategy since its own acquisition in 1996. Parts or all of the following companies or organizations were part of the sector: Westinghouse Electronic Systems, California Microwave, Litton Industries Advanced Electronics division, Solystic SA, Xetron Corporation, Aerojet Corporation Electronics & Information Systems, and Fibersense Technology Corp. During the period from 1996 to 2005, Electronic Systems' annual sales increased from US$2.3B to US$6.6B through organic growth as well as acquisitions.

The museum is located in Balboa Park and is housed in the former Ford Building, which is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places. SDASM was established by articles of incorporation on October 12, 1961 and opened to the public on February 15, 1963. Collection It contains many original and reproductions of historic aircraft and spacecraft, including: *Lockheed A-12 Oxcart *Bowlus SP-1 Paper Wing - replica *Convair YF2Y Sea Dart *Apollo 9 command module Gumdrop *Spirit of St. Louis replica (Spirit 3 was built after the 1978 fire) *Curtiss 1912 amphibious aircraft *Montgomery 1911 Evergreen glider *General Atomics MQ-1 Predator UAV (tail number 0018) *Ryan Firebee *Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk (1/2 scale model) *1902 Wright Glider (reproduction) *Wright Flyer (reproduction, currently not on display) *Vin Fiz Flyer (reproduction, at Gillespie Field annex) *Ford Trimotor *Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XVI *North American P-51D Mustang *SPAD VII.c.1 *Nieuport 28 *Curtiss JN4 \\"Jenny\\" (Currently returned to restoration to reskin the wings) *Curtiss P-40E Warhawk (No longer on display) *North American F-86F \\"Sabre\\" (at Gillespie Field annex) *Mitsubishi A6M7 \\"Zero-sen\\" *Grumman F-14 Tomcat (at Gillespie Field annex) *Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (at Gillespie Field annex) *Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 (It is in fact a Chinese Shenyang J-5.) *F-4S Phantom II *Bell AH-1E Cobra *PBY-5A Catalina *Horten Ho 229 (model) *P-26 Peashooter (currently on display) *Vought F4U Corsair (currently on display) *Ryan X-13 Vertijet (at Gillespie Field annex) SDASM promotes itself as one of the largest aviation museums in the nation, containing the third-largest collection of archives and library. SDASM has two restoration facilities, one on site, and the other located at Gillespie Field. The Gillespie Field Annex is open to the public with numerous aircraft on display outdoors, a Convair SM-65 Atlas ICBM, museum model shop, and a restoration shop. The museum's library contains an extensive collection of aircraft books and historic photographs of aircraft and aircraft manufacturing. History The museum was first opened to the public on February 15, 1963 in the Food and Beverage Building, which had been built in 1915 for the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition. In 1965 the museum was moved to the larger Electrical Building. On February 22, 1978 the Electrical Building and the Museum were destroyed in an arson fire.. Several one-of-a-kind aircraft were destroyed, including the Beecraft Wee Bee, the world's lightest aircraft, and her sister craft the Queen Bee. A reproduction of the Spirit of St. Louis, built in 1967 by some of the same people who built the original, was also destroyed, along with more than 50 other aircraft, an extensive collection of artifacts and archives, and the International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Owen Clarke, the museum's executive director, said of the $4 million in losses, \\"This is unbelievably tragic. When you've spent that length of time acquiring history, building something up to where it had international prestige, then see it all disappear in a couple of hours, what else can it be?\\" Entrance of the Ford Building with Firestone Singing Fountains, 1935. Before the fire, plans had already been under way to move the museum to the larger Ford Building, also in Balboa Park, which had been built for the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. Even though several important historic aircraft were lost in the fire, much of the collection on display was dated or insignificant. The museum was already accumulating new aircraft that were in storage awaiting space in the new building and so were spared from the fire. In addition, the community rallied, raising funds and donating items from private collections. The museum reopened, with a smaller but growing collection, in its current home in the former Ford Building on June 28, 1980. A new reproduction of the Spirit of St. Louis was built for the new museum. Because of its historical significance, a reproduction of the Wee Bee was also built. In 2005 the museum became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. It is one of only ten aerospace museums in the country to have such an affiliation, and one of only two affiliated museums in San Diego. The San Diego Air and Space Museum as seen from overhead in 2013. Exhibits The museum is divided into many galleries with exhibits emphasizing the contributions San Diego has made to aviation. Sections include the Theodore Gildred Rotunda, Special Exhibit area, World War I Gallery, Golden Age of Flight Gallery, World War II Gallery, and Modern Jet & Space Age Gallery, and the Edwin D. McKeller Pavilion of Flight. Admission is required and there is an additional cost to see the Special Exhibit. The restoration shop on site is available for tours when work is being done. =Theodore Gildred Rotunda= The Apollo 9 Command Module Gumdrop flown in 1969 by James McDivitt, David Scott, and Rusty Schweickart in preparation of the first lunar landing missions In addition to the Apollo 9 Command Module Gumdrop, the main entrance to the museum contains examples of aircraft from local San Diego companies. It also features the different types of exhibits throughout the museum. This includes originals, like the Montgomery 1911 Evergreen glider, models, like the 1/2 scale model of the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk, flyable reproductions, like the Curtiss A-1 amphibious aircraft, replicas, like the Ryan Aeronautical NYP (aka Spirit of St. Louis), and flight vehicles, like the Ryan Firebee and General Atomics MQ-1 Predator. =Special exhibits= In addition to the changing special exhibits at the front of the museum, there are a number of early aviation exhibits hanging from the ceiling. Visitors are encouraged to look up while making their way through the special exhibit. Guests who do not pay to see the special exhibit pass through the Hall of Fame hallway where portraits of aviation pioneers are displayed. Also along this hallway are exhibits about Jacqueline \\"Jackie\\" Cochran and the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Hanging above this area are exhibits of the Leonardo da Vinci Ornithopter (mock-up), Cayley Glider (reproduction), Lilienthal Glider (reproduction), Chanute Glider (reproduction), 1901 Wright Glider (reproduction), 1902 Wright Glider (reproduction), Deperdussin 1911 Type Militaire, Beachey \\"Little Looper\\" (reproduction), and Wright EX Vin Fiz Flyer. The museum also has the California lunar sample displays. =World War I Gallery= In addition to the boardwalk and era-style tent similar to those used by the Lafayette Escadrille, the gallery has reproductions of an Albatros D.Va, a Fokker Dr.I and Fokker E.III Eindecker, and authentic examples of a SPAD VII.c.1, Nieuport 28, and Sopwith Pup. The fabric skin of the Sopwith Pup was left off to make visible the complex structure and craftsmanship that went into the original aircraft, as well as these museum reproductions. Among the many displays is a model of the synchronization gear first developed for the Fokker Eindecker. With the press of a button, guests can see how the propeller and rotary engine would move and coordinate the trigger action so pilots wouldn't shoot off their own propellers in combat. =Golden Age of Flight Gallery= Along the long back stretch of this gallery are many aircraft both on the deck and hanging from the ceiling. Aircraft in this section include a Lincoln Standard J-1, Consolidated PT-1 Trusty, Aeronca C-3 Collegian, Ryan M-1 (replica), Fleet Model 2, Curtiss B-1 Robin, Gee Bee R-1, Bowlus SP-1 Albatross (reproduction), Ryan B-5 Brougham, Ryan STA, Piper J-3 Cub, and Pitts Special. The museum also has a number of aircraft engines on display. This gallery contains a Curtis OX-5, Aeronca E-107, Liberty L12-A, Wright J-3 Whirlwind, Curtiss Conqueror V-1570, Jacobs L-4MB (cutaway), Menasco 4A, and Continental A-40. The Curtiss JN-4D \\"Jenny\\" was returned to the restoration shop to reskin the wings. Access to the Edwin D. McKeller Pavilion of Flight is from this portion of the museum. This is also where the Education Center is which hosts monthly Family Day activities. Guests will also locate the restrooms for the museum in this section of the building. On some days lunch is available on the outer patio outside of this portion of the museum. There is an exhibit of the Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), also known as the Poor Sailor's Airline, in the museum. A replica of the airline's first ticket office has displays about the airline with a smile and includes stewardess uniforms from the 1950s through 1980s, including the hot pants worn during the 1970s. PSA Flight 182, registration N533PS, a Boeing 727-214 commercial airliner collided with a private Cessna 172 over San Diego on September 25, 1978. A memorial plaque honoring those who died on Flight 182 and on the ground is located at the museum, near the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda. On the 20th anniversary of the tragedy, a tree was planted next to the North Park branch library, and a memorial plaque was dedicated to those who lost their lives. =World War II Gallery= Ho.229 model The latest addition to the museum is the Horton 229 flying wing which was put on display July 2009. This was donated to the museum's permanent collection by Northrop Grumman (owners of Ryan Aeronautical) following radar testing at the same test site which was used for the B-2 stealth bomber. Details of the work on the model and the history of the aircraft were featured on the National Geographic Channel's documentary, Hitler's Stealth Fighter. This is the only Horten wing on public display. Other aircraft in this portion of the museum include a Stearman N2S-3 Kaydet, Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, North American P-51D Mustang, Douglas C-47 (CD-3) Nose and Cockpit section, Messerschmitt Bf 109G-14 (mock-up), Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XVI. This section of the museum is also where a mock- up of the USS Yorktown (CV-10) was built. This Essex Class aircraft carrier has many of the Navy aircraft on display, including a Douglas SBD-4 Dauntless, Grumman F6F-3 Hellcat, and Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat. Racing just feet over the deck, guests will see a Mitsubishi A6M7 Zero-sen. Throughout the gallery are many of the aircraft engines which were used during this period. On display are a Junkers Jumo 004B-1, Allison V-1710-39, Walter RI-202B, Rolls-Royce Merlin 62, Pratt & Whitney R-2800, Pratt & Whitney R-1830-17, Wright Cyclone 1820, Ranger 6-440C-2, and Ranger SGV-770C-1. =Modern Jet and Space Age Gallery= This gallery contains a Bee Aviation Wee Bee (replica), Douglas A-4B Skyhawk, F/A-18 A Hornet \\"Blue Angel 1\\", Gemini spacecraft (replica), and an Apollo Command and Service Module mock-up. At the far end of the gallery is the Boeing GPS-12 Satellite. This was an operational ground spare. Launched into space for the original GPS constellation were 23 operational spacecraft and two on orbit spares. A number of spares were flight ready on the ground in case there were malfunctions on orbit, these spacecraft could be launched as replacements. When the next generation of spacecraft were developed, the ground spares were no longer needed and one was donated to the museum. On display is a flight-ready GPS satellite. Along the inside wall of this gallery is the cockpit canopy of the North American X-15. This supersonic rocket plane first flew on June 8, 1959 with Scott Crossfield at the controls. Also in the display case near the canopy is Crossfield's flight suit from the X-15 and the air conditional case used by Neil Armstrong when he was an X-15 pilot. Eight of the X-15 pilots flew into space (above 60 miles) to earn their astronaut wings. The many astronauts who grew up and lived in the San Diego area include Wally Schirra, the only astronaut to command missions in Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. =Edwin D. McKellar Pavilion of Flight= The original courtyard of the Ford Building was used like a showroom during the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition. Now it houses many of the larger aircraft in the museum's collection. These aircraft include the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17, Mercury spacecraft (mock-up), Bell AH-1E Cobra, and Ford 5-AT-B Trimotor. The McDonnell Douglas F-4J/S Phantom II on display in the pavilion was the aircraft flown by Duke Cunningham and William P. Driscoll in Vietnam from the USS Constellation (CV-64). Cunningham was the first ace to get all of his kills with missiles. The aircraft here has both radar guided Sparrow missiles along the belly and infrared heat seeking Sidewinder missiles loaded on the wings. The museum also rents the pavilion to special events from lectures to dinners. Upon request volunteer museum docents can be available to provide additional information about the exhibits during these events. =Front of museum= On display outside the museum are the Lockheed A-12 and Convair YF2Y-1 Sea Dart. Special events The museum hosts a number of lectures, student programs, and other special events. Groups can rent the Pavilion of Flight for their own event or dinner.

Hume (January 23, 1827-May 18, 1904) was one of the American West's premier lawmen. Born in Stamford Township, Delaware County, New York, he left home in 1850 headed for the gold fields of California with his brother John. Hume panned gold and mined for a number of years in addition to operating a trade store off and on. In 1860 he began his career as a peace officer serving as deputy tax collector for El Dorado County, California. In 1864 he was elected City Marshal of Placerville, California, and in 1864 hired as Undersheriff of El Dorado County. He ran for Sheriff in 1865 and remained in office until 1870. In 1871 Wells, Fargo & Company hired him as a detective, but gave him a year's leave in 1872 to serve as deputy warden of the Nevada State Prison. He became one of the most prominent detectives of the times. He married Lida Munson on April 28, 1884, and had a son, Samuel James Hume. He never retired from the company, but after an illness in 1897 he slowed down and began working fewer road trips. He died at his home in Berkeley, California. Black Bart One of Hume's most famous cases was that of Black Bart. Black Bart may have been a cunning and intelligent stage coach robber, but detective Hume was an equally skilled lawman who eventually brought Bart to justice. James B. Hume had an impressive record as a California and Nevada lawman before he joined the Wells Fargo freight company in 1873. In both appearances and actions he had all the characteristics of a model western lawman: he was tall, handsome, modest, reticent, quietly efficient, and resourceful in his use of modern detection methods, including the science of ballistics. Hume had been trailing Black Bart almost from the beginning of the thief‚Äôs career. He visited the sites of all the robberies and patiently put together a valuable list of information. Witnesses in settlements near the scenes of the robberies described seeing a polite, friendly man in his fifties, about five foot eight or ten in height with brownish gray hair, a fierce gray mustache and matching goatee, carrying a bedroll (which Hume correctly inferred carried his duster, sack disguise, shotgun and loot), passing through on foot and quickly disappearing. Hume made special note of the reports by several witnesses that the man‚Äôs boots were neatly slit at the toes as if to relieve corns ‚Äì small wonder, given the territory Bart covered on foot (he never traveled by horse). Hume was well aware that this figure the locals had reported was likely to be the culprit. Hume‚Äôs major break occurred on November 3, 1883, when Bart robbed a Wells Fargo coach headed from the town of Sonora to Milton, in Calaveras County. One of the drivers fired a shot at Bart, and forced him to promptly flee. Within the nearby brush, local officers found a cache of rations and correctly assumed that the goods were the bandit's. More importantly however, a blood-stained handkerchief bearing the laundry mark \\"F.X.0.7\\" was recovered. Hume had previous engaged as a special detective Harry Morse, former sheriff of Alameda County, who now spent a week visiting every laundry in San Francisco ‚Äì nearly a hundred of them, to track down where the mark originated. Eventually Morse inquired its origin at a laundry on Bush Street in San Francisco. The proprietor identified the F.X.0.7 handkerchief mark as that assigned to C.E. Bolton, a man who lived in a hotel on Second Street. The arrest of Black Bart was at hand. Morse got Bart to accompany him to Hume's office in the nearby Wells Fargo building, and after a thorough grilling, Bart eventually confessed and receive a term in San Quentin prison. Hume and Morse were real detectives in a time when law work, outside of the Pinkerton Agency and Wells Fargo Operations, consisted principally of forming posses, serving warrants with a gun, and preventing mobs from lynching the miscreants. Few lawmen in 1883 put their noses on the carpet and searched for clues in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes (Holmes had not yet surfaced ‚Äì his first adventure was published in 1887) and not many did the legwork that ended Black Bart‚Äôs escapades. Other Family Hume's sister Mary married Mathew McClaughry in Kortwright, New York. Their oldest son Robert W. McClaughry served as a major in the 118th Illinois Infantry during the American Civil War. R.W. McClaughry would later serve as the Chicago Chief of Police, Warden of Joliet Prison and was the second warden of the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, KS. Popular culture In \\"The Bandits of Panamint,\\" the fifteenth episode of the first season of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, George Sherwood plays \\"Detective Hume\\" in a dramatization of Hume's pursuit of some stage robbers who, while on the run, have discovered a rich silver mine and devise a way to figure out how to register their claim without going to jail. In \\"Black Bart,\\" the sixteenth episode of the first season of Stories of the Century, the show's protagonist, Railroad Detective Matt Clark (Jim Davis) portrays the role that Hume played in real life. In \\"Black Bart,\\" the fourth episode from the third season of Death Valley Days, the battle of wits between Hume, played by John Damler, and a wily stage robber is dramatized. \\"Temporary Warden,\\" the first episode of the fourteenth season of Death Valley Days, dramatizes an incident from the career of Hume, played by Ronald Reagan, in which, after accepting a temporary appointment as warden of the Nevada State Prison in Carson City, he tracks down a trio of escaped convicts who had been terrorizing the state.

A comedo can be open (blackhead) or closed by skin (whitehead) and occur with or without acne. The word comedo comes from the Latin comedere, meaning 'to eat up', and was historically used to describe parasitic worms; in modern medical terminology, it is used to suggest the worm-like appearance of the expressed material. The chronic inflammatory condition that usually includes both comedones, inflamed papules and pustules (pimples), is called acne. Infection causes inflammation and the development of pus. Whether a skin condition classifies as acne depends on the amount of comedones and infection. Comedones should not be confused with sebaceous filaments. Comedo-type ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not related to the skin conditions discussed here. DCIS is a non-invasive form of breast cancer, but comedo-type DCIS may be more aggressive and so may be more likely to become invasive. Causes Oil production in the sebaceous glands increases during puberty, causing comedones and acne to be common in adolescents. Acne is also found premenstrually and in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Smoking may worsen acne. Oxidation rather than poor hygiene or dirt causes blackheads to be black. Washing or scrubbing the skin too much could make it worse, by irritating the skin. Touching and picking at comedones might cause irritation and spread infection. It is not clear what effect shaving has on the development of comedones or acne. Some, but not all, skin products might increase comedones by blocking pores, and greasy hair products (like pomades) can worsen acne. Skin products that claim to not clog pores may be labeled noncomedogenic or non-acnegenic. Make-up and skin products that are oil-free and water-based may be less likely to cause acne. It is not known whether dietary factors or sun exposure make comedones better, worse or have no effect. A hair that does not emerge normally, an ingrown hair, can also block the pore and cause a bulge or lead to infection (causing inflammation and pus). Genes may play a role in the chances of developing acne. Comedones may be more common in some ethnic groups. People of Latino and recent African descent may experience more inflammation in comedones, more comedonal acne, and earlier onset of inflammation. Pathophysiology Multiple closed comedones at the nasolabial fold and the alar of the nose Comedones are associated with the pilosebaceous unit, which includes a hair follicle and sebaceous gland. These units are mostly on the face, neck, upper chest, shoulders and back. Excess keratin combined with sebum can plug the opening of the follicle. This small plug is called a microcomedo. Androgens increase sebum (oil) production. If sebum continues to build up behind the plug, it can enlarge and form a visible comedo. A comedone may be open to the air (\\"blackhead\\") or closed by skin (\\"whitehead\\"). Being open to the air causes oxidation, which turns it black. Cutibacterium acnes is the suspected infectious agent in acne. It can proliferate in sebum and cause inflamed pustules (pimples) characteristic of acne. Nodules are inflamed, painful deep bumps under the skin. Comedones that are 1 mm or larger are called macrocomedones. They are closed comedones and are more frequent on the face than neck. Solar comedones (sometimes called senile comedones) are related to many years of exposure to the sun, usually on the cheeks, not to acne-related pathophysiology. Management Using non-oily cleansers and mild soap may not cause as much irritation to the skin as regular soap. Blackheads can be removed across an area with commercially available pore-cleansing strips (which can still damage the skin by leaving the pores wide open and ripping excess skin) or the more aggressive cyanoacrylate method used by dermatologists. Squeezing blackheads and whiteheads can remove them, but it can also damage the skin. Doing so increases the risk of causing or transmitting infection and scarring, as well as potentially pushing any infection deeper into the skin. Comedo extractors are used with careful hygiene in beauty salons and by dermatologists, usually after using steam or warm water. Complementary medicine options for acne in general have not been shown to be effective in trials. These include aloe vera, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), fruit-derived acids, kampo (Japanese herbal medicine), ayurvedic herbal treatments and acupuncture. Some acne treatments target infection specifically, but there are treatments that are aimed at the formation of comedones as well. Others remove the dead layers of the skin and may help clear blocked pores. Dermatologists can often extract open comedones with minimal skin trauma, but closed comedones are more difficult. Laser treatment for acne might reduce comedones, but dermabrasion and laser therapy have also been known to cause scarring. Macrocomedones (1 mm or larger) can be removed by a dermatologist using surgical instruments or cauterized with a device that uses light. The acne drug isotretinoin can cause severe flare-ups of macrocomedones, so dermatologists recommend removal before starting the drug and during treatment. Some research suggests that the common acne medications retinoids and azelaic acid are beneficial and do not cause increased pigmentation of the skin. If using a retinoid, sunscreen is recommended. Rare conditions Favre‚ÄìRacouchot syndrome occurs in sun-damaged skin and includes open and closed comedones. Nevus comedonicus or comedo nevus is a benign hamartoma (birthmark) of the pilosebaceous unit around the oil- producing gland in the skin. It has widened open hair follicles with dark keratin plugs that resemble comedones, but they are not actually comedones. Dowling-Degos disease is a genetic pigment disorder that includes comedo-like lesions and scars. Familial dyskeratotic comedones is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition, with keratotic (tough) papules and comedo-like lesions.

Peterson was a southpaw starting pitcher who enjoyed his best success in 1970 with the Yankees when he went 20‚Äì11 and pitched in the All-Star game. He is widely known for trading families with teammate Mike Kekich in the early 1970s. He had a career record of 133‚Äì131. Fritz Peterson has the lowest ratio of base on balls per innings pitched for any left-handed pitcher to pitch in the major leagues since the 1920s. Early life Fritz Peterson (first row, far left, with glasses) on the Arlington High School baseball team during his senior year. Peterson attended Arlington High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He was the number two pitcher on his high school team, behind Gene Dahlquist, who went on to play college football at the University of Arizona and professionally for the Norfolk Neptunes in the Continental Football League. Arlington High School produced several major league baseball players, including Paul Splittorff, Dick Bokelmann, and George Vukovich. He attended college at Northern Illinois University. He was viewed as a promising hockey player and gave up playing hockey to concentrate on baseball. He was signed by the New York Yankees in 1963 as an amateur free agent by Yankee scout Lou Maguolo. Peterson and Splittorff pitched against each other twice during their careers, with Peterson winning both matchups. On August 17, 1971, the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 2‚Äì0 at Yankee Stadium (in the days before the Designated Hitter, both pitchers went 0‚Äì2 at the plate), and on August 22, 1975 at the old Royals Stadium, the Indians beat the Royals, 9‚Äì5. Minor league career After signing with the Yankees, Peterson was assigned to the Rookie Appalachian League team in Harlan, Kentucky. In twelve games (ten starts), he went 4‚Äì3, with a 4.43 ERA; he struck out 80 batters in 61 innings pitched. He also hit .273 with one Home Run. His first professional baseball manager was Gary Blaylock. He played Winter Ball in the 1964 Florida East Coast Instructional League; he had a 7‚Äì2 record with a 1.68 ERA, striking out 45 batters in 59 innings. In 1964, he played for the Yankees Class A Western Carolinas League farm team in Shelby, North Carolina. In 21 starts, Peterson amassed a 10‚Äì7 record, with a 2.73 ERA; he struck out a team-leading 194 batters in 155 innings. He also hit .345 with four Home Runs. Peterson was even more impressive in his third season. Assigned to the Class A Carolinas League farm team in Greensboro, North Carolina, Peterson had an 11‚Äì1 record in fourteen starts, with a 1.50 ERA, and 83 strikeouts in 108 innings. He was later moved up to the Confederate Yankees in the Class AA Southern League in Columbus, Georgia. He went 5‚Äì5 with a 2.18 ERA in twelve starts with 62 Strikeouts in 91 innings. His teammates in Columbus included future Yankees Steve Whitaker, Stan Bahnsen, Mike Hegan, Mike Ferraro, and Roy White. Yankees minor league pitching coach Cloyd Boyer is credited with helping Peterson become a star pitcher. MLB rookie season Peterson was invited to spring training with the Yankees in 1966. Yankees manager Johnny Keane was high on Peterson, telling reporters that he averaged three strikeouts for every walk in the minors. At age 24, he became the number two starter on the Yankees pitching staff. He made his major league debut on Friday, April 15, 1966 against the Baltimore Orioles. Before a crowd of 35,624 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Peterson pitched a complete game, striking out three batters and walking none. The Yankees won 3‚Äì2, giving Peterson his first major league victory. Future Hall of Famer Frank Robinson hit a solo home run off of Peterson in the ninth inning, but he got Brooks Robinson to fly out to left and Boog Powell grounded out to first to give the Yankees the win. The losing pitcher was Wally Bunker. His first major league strikeouts were Paul Blair, Andy Etchebarren, and Bunker. \\"Where the vintage pitchers like Whitey Ford, Pedro Ramos and Bob Friend had failed, Frederick (Fritz) Peterson succeeded yesterday for the New York Yankees. In his first major league game, the 24-year-old left-hander beat the Baltimore Orioles, 3‚Äì2, and drew an accolade from his manager, Johnny Keane,\\" the New York Times wrote of his debut. Keane said: \\"Not many young pitchers have his control. That's his strength, that and his fastball.\\" The Yankees starting lineup for Peterson's first game was: Bobby Richardson at 2B, Roy White in CF, Roger Maris in RF, Tom Tresh in LF, Joe Pepitone at 1B, Clete Boyer at 3B, Elston Howard at C, and Bobby Murcer at SS. In his rookie season, Peterson went 12‚Äì11 in 32 starts for the Yankees. He had a 3.31 ERA with 96 strikeouts in 215 innings. He tied Mel Stottlemyre (12‚Äì20) as the team leader in wins. The Yankees finished last in the American League that season with a 70‚Äì89 (.440) record. Keane was replaced during the season with a new manager, Ralph Houk. Peterson wore #52 on his uniform during his rookie season, and switched to #19 in 1967 after Bob Friend was traded to the New York Mets. Yankees starting pitcher Peterson went 8‚Äì14 in 1967 (3.47 ERA, 102 strikeouts), 12‚Äì11 in 1968 (2.63 ERA, 115 strikeouts), and 17‚Äì16 in 1969 (2.55 ERA, 150 strikeouts). He had the best season of his career in 1970, with a 20‚Äì11 record (2.90 ERA, 127 strikeouts). He went 15‚Äì13 in 1971 (3.05 ERA, 130 strikeouts), 17‚Äì15 in 1972 (3.24 ERA, 100 strikeouts), and 8‚Äì15 in 1973 (3.95 ERA, 59 strikeouts). In 1969 and 1970, Peterson had the best strikeout-to-walk ratios in the AL. Peterson also led the league in fewest walks per 9 innings pitched 5 years in a row, 1968‚Äì1972. The last pitcher who did that 5 years in a row was Cy Young. In 1970 and 1975, he had the 10th-best win-loss percentages in the league. During the final game at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, September 21, 2008, ESPN Sports announced that Fritz Peterson had the all-time lowest earned run average at Yankee Stadium, with a 2.52 ERA. Whitey Ford was second with a 2.55 ERA. The honor is permanent since Yankee Stadium has been demolished. Peterson was the starting pitcher for the Yankees in the last game played at the original Yankee Stadium, which was completely renovated after the final game of the 1973 season. In his nine years as a Yankees pitcher, Peterson had a 109‚Äì106 record, with a 3.10 ERA and 893 strikeouts. Between 1969 and 1972, Peterson was one of the most successful left handed pitchers in baseball; only Mike Cuellar, Mickey Lolich and Dave McNally won more games in the American League than Peterson did during those four years. He is ninth on the Yankees All-Time Games Started list, and tenth on the All-Time Yankees Innings Pitched list. Peterson never played in a post- season game with the Yankees. ‚ÄúMediocre at best,‚Äù Peterson said of the Yankee teams that followed the Mantle-Maris era of the mid to late 1960s. ‚ÄúPathetic at worst.‚Äù American League All-Star He was named to the 1970 AL All-Star team. The American League team was leading 4‚Äì1 in the bottom of the ninth inning when Catfish Hunter gave up a Home Run and two singles. With runners at first and second, Peterson was called in by AL Manager Earl Weaver to replace Hunter. Future Hall of Famer Willie McCovey singled tor right, driving in Bud Harrelson, with future HOF'er Joe Morgan moving to third. Fellow Yankee Stottlemyre then replaced Peterson. Wife swapping Peterson is probably best remembered today for swapping wives and children with fellow Yankee pitcher Mike Kekich, an arrangement the pair announced at spring training in March 1973. The Peterson and Kekich families had been friends since 1969. Peterson and the former Susanne Kekich are still married, but the relationship between Kekich and Marilyn Peterson did not last very long. By June, the Yankees traded Kekich. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a love story. It wasn‚Äôt anything dirty,‚Äù Peterson told a reporter in 2013. ‚ÄúI could not be happier with anybody in the world. ‚ÄòMy girl' and I go out and party every night. We‚Äôre still on the honeymoon and it has been a real blessing.\\" Trade to Cleveland Indians Peterson's pitching seemed to suffer in 1973 and 1974 after the swap, and he was roundly booed in nearly every American League ballpark afterwards. He was traded along with Steve Kline, Fred Beene and Tom Buskey by the Yankees to the Cleveland Indians for Chris Chambliss, Dick Tidrow and Cecil Upshaw on April 26, 1974.Strauss, Michael. \\"Yanks Win, Trade 4 Pitchers,\\" The New York Times, Saturday, April 27, 1974. Retrieved June 16, 2015 Peterson went 9‚Äì14 for the Indians in 1974, and 14‚Äì8 in 1975. Peterson wore #30 during the 1974 season, and switched to #16 in 1975 and 1976. Later career with Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox After starting the 1976 season with an 0‚Äì3 record, Cleveland traded Peterson to the Texas Rangers on May 28 for Stan Perzanowski and cash. He started two games for the Rangers and had a 1‚Äì0 record when a shoulder injury ended his season. The Rangers released him on February 2, 1977. Two weeks later, he signed as a Free Agent with the Chicago White Sox. After his second shoulder surgery, Peterson announced his retirement from baseball on May 4, 1977. Post-baseball career Peterson provided color commentary for the New York Raiders of the World Hockey Association during the 1972‚Äì73 season. Later, Peterson and Susanne Kekich lived outside Chicago, where he worked as a blackjack dealer at the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois. Peterson is also notable for his appearances in Jim Bouton's bestselling 1970 non-fiction book Ball Four, where he is generally portrayed as one of the few major leaguers and former Yankees who had a positive view of Bouton. Fritz Peterson released his first book, Mickey Mantle Is Going to Heaven in July 2009. Eventually, Peterson says, \\"he plans to meet Mantle there and talk about old times.\\" Sports author Maury Allen is quoted as saying, \\"Fritz's book is even better than Bouton's Ball Four.\\" He is the author of The Art of De-Conditioning: Eating Your Way to Heaven, where he writes about his decision to \\"accept his own eating habits and no longer worry about his weight affecting him on the field.\\" His third book, When the Yankees Were on the Fritz: Revisiting the Horace Clarke Era, looks at a low-point in Yankee history when the team could not win a pennant despite the pitching combination of Peterson and Stottlemyre. Peterson is a cancer survivor, having battled prostate cancer twice. He is an \\"intensively religious\\" man, an \\"evangelical Christian who used to work with Baseball Chapel.\\" A known practical joker, Peterson was reportedly popular with this teammates, entertaining them with his elaborate jokes. He once used fake Baseball Hall of Fame letterhead to ask Moose Skowron to donate his pacemaker after he died, and used fake Yankees letterhead to ask Clete Boyer to participate in an \\"official drinking contest\\" against Don Larsen and Graig Nettles. Peterson is a regular attendee at the Yankees Fantasy Camp in Florida, and the Yankees Old-Timers' Day game at Yankee Stadium. On July 23, 2018, Peterson announced on his Facebook page that he was diagnosed \\"with Alzheimer's several months ago after falling apart very quickly.\\" Movie project As of 2015, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were developing a movie based on Peterson and Kekich, and owned the rights to \\"The Trade,\\" based on a book by Allen. Jay Roach was attached as director. Peterson will serve as a consultant to Warner Bros.

A Taylor cone refers to the cone observed in electrospinning, electrospraying and hydrodynamic spray processes from which a jet of charged particles emanates above a threshold voltage. Aside from electrospray ionization in mass spectrometry, the Taylor cone is important in field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) and colloid thrusters used in fine control and high efficiency (low power) thrust of spacecraft.  History  This cone was described by Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor in 1964 before electrospray was \\"discovered\\". This work followed on the work of Zeleny who photographed a cone-jet of glycerine in a strong electric field and the work of several others: Wilson and Taylor (1925), Nolan (1926) and Macky (1931). Taylor was primarily interested in the behavior of water droplets in strong electric fields, such as in thunderstorms.  Formation  Electrospray diagram depicting the Taylor cone, jet and plume When a small volume of electrically conductive liquid is exposed to an electric field, the shape of liquid starts to deform from the shape caused by surface tension alone. As the voltage is increased the effect of the electric field becomes more prominent. As this effect of the electric field begins to exert a similar magnitude of force on the droplet as the surface tension does, a cone shape begins to form with convex sides and a rounded tip. This approaches the shape of a cone with a whole angle (width) of 98.6¬∞. When a certain threshold voltage has been reached the slightly rounded tip inverts and emits a jet of liquid. This is called a cone-jet and is the beginning of the electrospraying process in which ions may be transferred to the gas phase. It is generally found that in order to achieve a stable cone-jet a slightly higher than threshold voltage must be used. As the voltage is increased even more, other modes of droplet disintegration are found. The term Taylor cone can specifically refer to the theoretical limit of a perfect cone of exactly the predicted angle or generally refer to the approximately conical portion of a cone-jet after the electrospraying process has begun.  Theory  Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor in 1964 described this phenomenon, theoretically derived based on general assumptions that the requirements to form a perfect cone under such conditions required a semi-vertical angle of 49.3¬∞ (a whole angle of 98.6¬∞) and demonstrated that the shape of such a cone approached the theoretical shape just before jet formation. This angle is known as the Taylor angle. This angle is more precisely \\\\pi-\\\\theta _0\\\\, where \\\\theta _0\\\\, is the first zero of P _{1/2} (\\\\cos\\\\theta _0)\\\\, (the Legendre polynomial of order 1/2). Taylor's derivation is based on two assumptions: (1) that the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) that the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium. To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have azimuthal symmetry and have \\\\sqrt{R}\\\\, dependence to counter the surface tension to produce the cone. The solution to this problem is: :V=V_0+AR^{1/2}P _{1/2} (\\\\cos\\\\theta _0)\\\\, where V=V_0\\\\, (equipotential surface) exists at a value of \\\\theta _0 (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone. The angle necessary for V=V_0\\\\, for all R is a zero of P _{1/2} (\\\\cos\\\\theta _0)\\\\, between 0 and \\\\pi\\\\, which there is only one at 130.7099¬∞. The complement of this angle is the Taylor angle.

As an example, someone could use blackmail to induce a contractor into breaking a contract, or they could obstruct someone's ability to honor a contract with a client by deliberately refusing to deliver necessary goods. A tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others, causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout that prevents the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.  Description  Tortious interference with contract rights can occur when one party persuades another to breach its contract with a third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods). The tortfeasor is the person who interferes with the contractual relationship between others. When a tortfeasor is aware of an existing contract and deliberately induces a breach by one of the contract holders, it is termed, \\"tortious inducement of breach of contract.\\" Tortious interference with business relationships occurs where the tortfeasor intentionally acts to prevent someone from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships with others. This tort may occur when one party knowingly takes an action that causes a second party not to enter into a business relationship with a third party that otherwise would probably have occurred. An example is when a tortfeasor offers to sell a property to someone below market value knowing they were in the final stages of a sale with a third party pending the upcoming settlement date to formalize the sale writing. Such conduct is termed \\"tortious interference with a business expectancy\\". The above situation are actionable only if someone with actual knowledge of, and intent to interfere with, an existing contract or expectancy between other parties, acts improperly with malicious intent and actually interferes with the contract/expectancy, causing economic harm. Historically, there has not been actionable cause if the interference was merely .See Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 175 U.S. 303 (1927) (lost profits held remote damage); Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 766C (1979). See also Venhaus v. Shultz, 155 Cal. App. 4th 1072, 1079‚Äî1080, 66 Cal. Rptr. 3d 432 (2007) (\\"[W]e have been directed to no California authority, and have found none, for the trial court‚Äôs conclusion that the wrongful conduct must be intentional or willful. The defendant‚Äôs conduct must ‚Äòfall outside the boundaries of fair competition‚Äô. . . . but negligent misconduct or the violation of a statutory obligation suffice.\\") (internal citations omitted.). However, for some jurisdictions recognize such claims,See Union Oil Co. v. Oppen, 501 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1974) (holding negligent interference with prospective advantage actionable when risk of harm was foreseeable); In re Kinsman Transit Co., 388 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 1968) (dictum: stating that negligent interference with contract should receive same legal treatment as other negligent acts); J‚ÄôAire Corp. v. Gregory, 24 Cal. 3d 799, 804, 157 Cal. Rptr. 407, 598 P.2d 60 (1979) (‚ÄúWhere a special relationship exists between the parties, a plaintiff may recover for loss of expected economic advantage through the negligent performance of a contract although the parties were not in contractual privity.‚Äù) (emphasis supplied); Settimo Associates v. Environ Systems, Inc., 14 Cal. App. 4th 842, 845, 17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 757 (1993) (‚ÄúThe tort of intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage imposes liability for improper methods of disrupting or diverting the business relationship of another which fall outside the boundaries of fair competition.‚Äù) (emphasis supplied) (internal citation omitted). There used to be California authority that no cause of action exists for negligent interference with contractual relations. See Fifield Manor v. Finston, 54 Cal. 2d 632, 636‚Äî637, 7 Cal. Rptr. 377, 354 P.2d 1073 (1960). But the J'Aire decision, supra, appears to have overruled Fifield. Nevertheless, however illogical it may seem, it is arguable that California does not recognize a tort of negligent interference with contractual relations, but does recognize a tort of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. See Young v. Fluorotronics, S.D. Calif. 2010). (This is comparable to recognizing manslaughter but decriminalizing murder.) although many do not.See, e.g., Ramirez v. Selles, 784 P.2d 433, 436 (Or. 1989) (\\"Negligent injury to one person that harms another's contract or other economic relationship is not a tort, at least not unless some duty of defendant outside negligence law itself protects the injured interest of the plaintiff against negligent invasion.\\"). A tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout preventing the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers. Case law An early, perhaps the earliest, instance of recognition of this tort occurred in Garret v Taylor, 79 Eng. Rep. 485 (K.B. 1620). In that case, the defendant drove customers away from the plaintiff's quarry by threatening them with mayhem and also threatening to ‚Äúvex [them] with suits.‚Äù The King's Bench court said that ‚Äúthe defendant threatened violence to the extent of committing an assault upon ... customers of the plaintiff ... whereupon ‚Äòthey all desisted from buying.‚Äô‚Äô The court therefore upheld a judgment for the plaintiff. In a similar case, Tarleton v McGawley, 170 Eng. Rep. 153 (K.B. 1793), the defendant shot from its ship, Othello, off the coast of Africa upon natives while ‚Äúcontriving and maliciously intending to hinder and deter the natives from trading with‚Äù plaintiff's rival trading ship, Bannister. This action caused the natives (plaintiff's prospective customers) to flee the scene, depriving the plaintiff of their potential business. The King's Bench court held the conduct actionable. The defendant claimed, by way of justification, that the local native ruler had given it an exclusive franchise to trade with his subjects, but the court rejected this defense. The tort was described in the case of Keeble v Hickeringill, (1707) 103 Eng. Rep. 1127, styled as a \\"trespass on the case\\". In that case, the defendant had used a shotgun to drive ducks away from a pond that the plaintiff had built for the purpose of capturing ducks. Thus, unlike the foregoing cases, here the actionable conduct was not directly driving the prospective customers away, but rather eliminating the subject matter of the prospective business. Although the ducks had not yet been captured, the Justice Holt wrote for the court that \\"where a violent or malicious act is done to a man's occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood, there an action lies in all cases.\\" The court noted that the defendant would have the right to draw away ducks to a pond of his own, raising as a comparison a 1410 case in which the court deemed that no cause of action would lie where a schoolmaster opened a new school that drew students away from an old school. The application of the above has since been modified in UK law. In OBG v Allan [2008] 1 AC 1. Wrongful interference: the unified theory which treated causing loss by unlawful means as an extension of the tort of inducing a breach of contract was abandoned; inducing breach of contract and causing loss by unlawful means were two separate torts. inducing a breach of contract was a tort of accessory liability, and an intention to cause a breach of contract was a necessary and sufficient requirement for liability; a person had to know that he was inducing a breach of contract and to intend to do; that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact could be treated as knowledge for the purposes of the tort; that a person who knowingly induced a breach of contract as a means to an end had the necessary intent even if he was not motivated by malice but had acted with the motive of securing an economic advantage for himself; that, however, a breach of contract which was neither an end in itself nor a means to an end but was merely a foreseeable consequence of a person's acts did not give rise to liability; and that there could be no secondary liability without primary liability, and therefore a person could not be liable for inducing a breach of contract unless there had in fact been a breach by the contracting party. Causing loss by unlawful means: acts against a third party counted as unlawful means only if they were actionable by that third party if he had suffered loss; that unlawful means consisted of acts intended to cause loss to the claimant by interfering with the freedom of a third party in a way which was unlawful as against that third party and which was intended to cause loss to the claimant, but did not include acts which might be unlawful against a third party but which did not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant. Strict liability for conversion applied only to an interest in chattels and not to chooses in action; this was too radical to impose liability for pure economic loss on receivers who had been appointed and had acted in good faith. This also left open the position where they breached the duty of good faith.  Typical examples  #Tortious interference of business.- When false claims and accusations are made against a business or an individual's reputation in order to drive business away. #Tortious interference of contract.- When an individual uses \\"tort\\" (a wrongful act) to come between two parties' mutual contract. Elements Although the specific elements required to prove a claim of tortious interference vary from one jurisdiction to another, they typically include the following: #The existence of a contractual relationship or beneficial business relationship between two parties. #Knowledge of that relationship by a third party. #Intent of the third party to induce a party to the relationship to breach the relationship. #Lack of any privilege on the part of the third party to induce such a breach. #The contractual relationship is breached. #Damage to the party against whom the breach occurs. The first element may, in employment-at-will jurisdictions, be held fulfilled in regards to a previously unterminated employer/employee relationship. In California, these are the elements of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, which the plaintiff must establish: # an economic relationship existed between the plaintiff and a third party which contained a reasonably probable future economic benefit or advantage to plaintiff; # the defendant knew of the existence of the relationship and was aware or should have been aware that if it did not act with due care its actions would interfere with this relationship and cause plaintiff to lose in whole or in part the probable future economic benefit or advantage of the relationship; # the defendant was negligent; and # such negligence caused damage to plaintiff in that the relationship was actually interfered with or disrupted and plaintiff lost in whole or in part the economic benefits or advantage reasonably expected from the relationship.North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court, 59 Cal. App. 4th 764, 786, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 466 (1997). Some cases add that a defendant acts negligently only if \\"the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.\\"E.g., Limandri v. Judkins, 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 348, 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 539 (1997). California and most jurisdictions hold that there is a privilege to compete for business. ‚ÄúUnder the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant‚Äôs interference is somehow wrongful‚Äîi.e., based on facts that take the defendant‚Äôs actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.‚ÄùTri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg. 216 Cal. App. 3d 1139, 1153‚Äî1154, 265 Cal. Rptr. 330 (1989). \\"[T]he competition privilege is defeated only where the defendant engages in unlawful or illegitimate means.\\" San Francisco Design Center Associates v. Portman Companies, 41 Cal. App. 4th 29, 42, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 716 (1995). \\"Wrongful\\" in this context means ‚Äúindependently wrongful‚Äù‚Äîthat is, \\"blameworthy\\" or \\" independently wrongful apart from the interference itself.\\"Lange v. TIG Insurance Co., 68 Cal. App. 4th 1179, 1187, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 39 (1999). This may be termed use of improper means. ‚ÄúCommonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.‚ÄùPMC, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc., 45 Cal. App. 4th 579, 603. Other examples of \\"wrongful conduct\\" are \\"fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation, coercion, obstruction or molestation of the rival or his servants or workmen.\\"Charles C. Chapman Building Co. v. California Mart, 2 Cal. App. 3d 846, 857, 82 Cal. Rptr. 830 (1969). Damages Typical legal damages for tortious interference include economic losses, if they can be proven with certainty, and mental distress. Additionally punitive damages may be awarded if malice on the part of the wrongdoer can be established. Equitable remedies may include injunctive relief in the form of a negative injunction that would be used to prevent the wrongdoer from benefiting from any contractual relationship that may arise out of the interference, i.e., the performance of a singer who was originally contracted with the plaintiff to perform at the same time. Additional example Tortious interference with an expected inheritance - One who, by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received, is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift. (Believed to be the first claim for tortious interference with inheritance expectancy to withstand appeal in the State of Missouri).

His autobiography Lanterns on the Levee (Knopf 1941) became a bestseller. His father LeRoy Percy was the last United States Senator from Mississippi elected by the legislature. In a largely Protestant state, the younger Percy championed the Roman Catholicism of his French mother. Life and career He was born to Camille, a French Catholic, and LeRoy Percy, of the planter class in Mississippi, and grew up in Greenville. His father was elected as US senator in 1910. As an attorney and planter with 20,000 acres under cultivation for cotton, he was very influential at the Episcopal university, Sewanee: The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, a postbellum tradition in his family. He spent a year in Paris before going to Harvard for a law degree. After returning to Greenville, Percy joined his father's firm in the practice of law. During World War I, Percy joined the Commission for Relief in Belgium in November 1916. He served in Belgium as a delegate until the withdrawal of American personnel upon the US declaration of war in April 1917. He served in the US Army in World War I, earning the rank of Captain and the Croix de Guerre. From 1925 to 1932, Percy edited the Yale Younger Poets series, the first of its kind in the country. He also published four volumes of poetry with the Yale University Press. A Southern man of letters, Percy befriended many fellow writers, Southern, Northern and European, including William Faulkner. He socialized with Langston Hughes and other people in and about the Harlem Renaissance. Percy was a sort of godfather to the Fugitives at Vanderbilt, or Southern Agrarians, as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren were often called. Percy's family was plagued with suicides, including that of his first cousin LeRoy Pratt Percy and possibly his wife, Martha Susan (Mattie Sue) Phinizy Percy, who died in a car accident. William adopted his cousin's children, Walker, LeRoy (Roy) and Phinizy (Phin) Percy, after they were orphaned. As adults, all three prospered. Walker became a medical doctor and a best-selling author. Roy married Sarah Hunt Farish, the daughter of Will Percy's law partner, Hazlewood Power Farish. He took charge of the Percy family plantation, Trail Lake. Phin married and moved to New Orleans to practice law. Percy's most well-known work is his memoir, Lanterns on the Levee: Recollections of a Planter's Son (Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1941). His other works include the text of \\"They Cast Their Nets in Galilee,\\" which is included in the Episcopal Hymnal (1982) (Hymn 661), and the Collected Poems (Knopf 1943). One of his pieces was published under the name A. W. Percy in Men and Boys, an anonymous anthology of Uranian poetry (New York, 1934). Percy was the playwright behind a one-act scene in a volume of poetry, \\"In April Once\\" (1920). A friend of Herbert Hoover from the Belgium Relief Effort during the early years of World War I, Percy was put in charge of relief during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when an area larger than all New England minus Maine was flooded in the spring. During the flood, thousands of blacks, fleeing farms and plantations under water, sought refuge on the levee in Greenville. Percy believed that the refugees needed to be evacuated to Vicksburg to receive better care and food, and he arranged for ships to prepare to remove them. However, LeRoy Percy and local planters prevented the evacuation, and the refugees remaining on the levee were forced to work in conditions that many compared to slavery. The Colored Advisory Commission led by Robert Russa Moton, formed to investigate abuses that had taken place during the flood, named the Greenville camp as one where black refugees complained of poor treatment.

It consists of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines Reserve and Naval Careers Service. The term Naval Service should be distinguished from the \\"UK Naval Services\\", which consist of the Naval Service and the Merchant Navy. The Naval Service as a whole falls under the command of the Navy Board, which is headed by the First Sea Lord. This position is currently held by Admiral Tony Radakin (appointed June 2019). The Defence Council delegates administration of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Naval Service is dominated by the Royal Navy, and operates primarily from three bases in the United Kingdom where commissioned ships are based; Portsmouth, Clyde and Devonport, the last being the largest operational naval base in Western Europe. As of 2019, there are over 184 vessels in service with the various branches of the Naval Service and supporting organisations, including; 75 commissioned ships of the Royal Navy, 33 landing craft of the Royal Marines, 63 auxiliary vessels of Marine Services and 13 auxiliary ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. As of March 2019, Her Majesty's Naval Service employed a total of 40,600 personnel. Under a Navy Command 2020 transformation plan, the term, 'Naval Service' will cease to exist and be replaced by just 'Royal Navy'. The total displacement of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is as of December 2019 in excess of 815,200 tonnes. Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy=Current composition= According to the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy the Naval Service consists of: * The Royal Navy (Royal Naval Reserve) - including Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service * The Royal Marines (Royal Marines Reserve) * Naval Careers Service The Naval Service is also supported by Marine Services (currently provided under a private finance initiative) and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary which both operate a fleet of auxiliaries in support of the Royal Navy. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary is considered part of the Ministry of Defence Civil Service. =Former composition= The following services were formerly also components of the Naval Service: * The Women's Royal Naval Service (merged into the Royal Navy in 1993) * The Royal Naval Minewatching Service (reformed into the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service in 1962 and disbanded in 1994) * The Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service (incorporated within the Royal Navy in 2000) Naval Reserve Forces: * The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (merged with the Royal Naval Reserve in 1958) ** The Royal Naval Volunteer (Supplementary) Reserve ** The Royal Naval Volunteer (Wireless) Reserve ** The Royal Naval Volunteer (Postal) Reserve) * The Royal Naval Emergency Reserve (disbanded c. 1959) * The Royal Naval Special Reserve (disbanded c. 1960) * The Women's Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (renamed the Women's Royal Naval Reserve in 1958, merged into the Royal Naval Reserve in 1993) ** The Women's Royal Naval Supplementary Reserve * The Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service Reserve (incorporated within the Royal Naval Reserve in 2000) Formerly the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service, the Fleet Reserve, and the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors were also considered part of the Naval Service. Composition of the Naval Service=Royal Navy= Referred to as the \\"Senior Service\\" by virtue of it being the oldest service within the British Armed Forces, the Royal Navy is a technologically sophisticated naval force and forms the core structure of the Naval Service. Command of deployable assets is exercised by the Fleet Commander. The United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent is carried aboard the navy's of four nuclear ballistic-missile submarines. The surface fleet consists of destroyers, frigates, amphibious assault ships, patrol ships, mine-countermeasures, and miscellaneous vessels. The submarine service has existed within the Royal Navy for more than 100 years. The service possessed a combined fleet of diesel-electric and nuclear- powered submarines until the early 1990s. Following the Options for Change defence review, the Upholder-class diesel-electric submarines were withdrawn and the attack submarine flotilla is now exclusively nuclear-powered.

It is the smallest component of the Naval Service comprising fewer than 200 personnel. In support of the Naval Service=Royal Fleet Auxiliary= The Royal Fleet Auxiliary is a civilian-manned fleet owned by the British Ministry of Defence. The RFA enables ships of the Royal Navy to maintain operations around the world. Its primary role is to supply the Royal Navy with fuel, ammunition and supplies, normally by replenishment at sea (RAS). It also transports Army and Royal Marine personnel, as well as supporting training exercises. RFA personnel are members of the Ministry of Defence civil service who wear Merchant Navy rank insignia with naval uniforms and are under naval discipline when the vessel is engaged on warlike operations. RFA vessels are commanded and crewed by these civilians, augmented with regular and reserve Royal Navy personnel to perform specialised military functions such as operating and maintaining helicopters or providing hospital facilities. The RFA is funded out of the UK defence budget and the Commodore commanding the RFA is directly responsible to the Royal Navy Fleet Commander. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary also augments the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capabilities through its three vessels. The service is manned by around 1,850 civilian personnel.

Downloaded on 14 June 2016. The name acocil comes from the Nahuatl ', meaning \\"crooked one of the water\\" or \\"squirms in the water\\". It is a traditional foodstuff of the Pre-Columbian Mexicans, who boiled or baked the animal, and ate it in tacos. This is a common species in its range, becoming abundant in some areas. It can be found in a number of aquatic habitat types, including artificial habitats such as canals. It is found in areas with aquatic vegetation, and it often buries itself among the roots. It can tolerate a relatively wide range of temperatures, pH, and oxygen concentrations. It is considered to be a least- concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because it is adaptable, its populations are stable, and it faces no major threats. Minor threats include the introduction of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) into the area. The acocil is still a subsistence food source for local people.

He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011. New York magazine ranked Klein as one of the most influential people in public education.\\"The Influentials: Education.\\" New York magazine. Retrieved on July 10, 2013. Klein had never obtained the common formal credentials that one would have to take a leadership role in a public school system, and Klein had a short duration of teaching experience.Merrow, John. \\"Love or loathe him, Joel Klein is the person most responsible for shaping U.S. schools today.\\" New York Daily News. Sunday June 5, 2011. Retrieved on July 10, 2013. \\"But the evidence suggests that our most influential educator is a lawyer who only very briefly taught in public school and never had the formal credentials to lead a public school system.\\"  Early life and education  Klein grew up in New York City and attended public schools, graduating from William Cullen Bryant High School in Queens in 1963. He attended Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He received his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, again graduating magna cum laude, in 1971. He then clerked for Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1973 until 1974, before then clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.  Career  In 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, DC, non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein specialized in constitutional and health-care.Joel I. Klein Biography After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding a law firm with several partners. In the 1990s, Klein served in the White House Counsel's office under President Bill Clinton, before being appointed to the United States Department of Justice. There, he was appointed United States Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, and in this capacity he was the lead prosecutor in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft. Prior to his appointment to chancellor in 2002 by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Klein was counsel to Bertelsmann, an international media group. Klein was rumored to be one of Barack Obama's candidates for Secretary of Education. Ultimately, the position went to the chief executive officer of Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, then to New York State Education Commissioner John King Jr.  New York City School Chancellor  In 1998, before Klein became Chancellor, the New York City Board of Education transferred responsibility for school safety to the New York City Police Department. Klein has been criticized for not seeking to alter this arrangement or to curb the conduct of the Police Department's school safety agents in the face of allegations of abuse. Klein has praised the work of the school-safety agents in contributing to a decrease in crime in the public schools. Despite their opposing positions in the Justice Department antitrust case against Microsoft, Klein was able to work with the Gates Foundation to fund the creation of smaller schools in New York City. At the 43 small high schools funded by the Gates Foundation graduation rates are 73% compared to 53% at the schools they replaced.Melinda Gates goes public The researchers only examined schools selectively; for example, 33 small schools were omitted from the analysis. According to Bob Herbert, Bill Gates, speaking about the national movement for smaller schools, stated in 2008, that ‚ÄúSimply breaking up existing schools into smaller units often did not generate the gains we were hoping for.‚Äù. A series of analyses by the research institute MDRC found that the \\"Small Schools of Choice\\" (SSC) had \\"marked increases in progress toward graduation and in graduation rates\\" for three successive cohorts of students analyzed (students who entered the SSCs in 2005, 2006, and 2007) compared with other schools, including students of color, compared with students of color at similar schools.https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/sustained_progress_FR_0.pdf (Small Schools of Choice are academically non-selective, small in size, and were structured to be a reasonable choice for students of varying academic backgrounds.)https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/sustained_progress_FR_0.pdf In 2004, a controversy beset Klein's administration, as two members of his staff -- deputy chancellor Diana Lam and lawyer Chad Vignola -- both resigned amid accusations of nepotism; she was accused of helping her husband gain employment in the system without following conflicts of interest procedures, and Vignola was accused of trying to cover it up.\\"Key N.Y.C. School Official Forced to Resign,\\" Education Week.\\"Schools' Top Lawyer Quits In Uproar Over Nepotism,\\" The New York Times. A report by Schools Investigator Richard Condon found Lam helped her husband get two jobs improperly, and criticized Vignola for falsely claiming that the husband was a volunteer rather than a hired employee.\\"Ed. Flap Lawyer Resigns ‚Äì Accused Of Cover-Up,\\" The New York Post. In 2005, Klein fired Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi from the teacher training program, reportedly because of Khalidi's political views. After the controversial decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: \\"The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles.... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts.\\" The program's creator Mark Willner stated that (Khalidi) \\"spoke on geography and demography,\\" and that \\"There was nothing controversial, nothing political.\\" In 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more. Klein denied a conflict of interest. Finally, in 2014, the Education Department decided to abandon the system, due to its high cost, limited functionality, and little use by parents and staff. In 2007, the Klein launched a major redesign of the formula used to fund schools. Previously, funding for teachers had been based on the salaries of the teachers in the building, leading to more funding for schools in schools with students from more affluent backgrounds, as teachers tended to stay at those schools longer (and be relatively better paid than teachers with less experience). Under Klein's \\"Fair Student Funding\\" program, schools were given amounts of money based on the enrollment and demographics of students, such as special education and low-income. This eventually accounted for 66% of all funding to schools.https://www.americanprogress.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/03/NYCeducationReport.pdf https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/bloombergs-education- plan-is-working-dont-ditch-it/280704/ During the Bloomberg Administration, whose educational legacy was largely determined by Klein's chancellorship, graduation rates in New York City went up for all ethnic groups, although the gap between graduation rates between ethnic groups remained stubbornly persistent. From 2005-2012, the graduation rate for white students rose from 64% to 78%, for Asian-American students from 63% to 82%, and for Black students from 40% to 60%.https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/bloombergs- education-plan-is-working-dont-ditch-it/280704/ Overall, high school graduation rates increased from 54% in 2004 to almost 75% in 2013. https://www.thecity.nyc/education/2020/2/26/21210501/a-quick-study-on-mike- bloomberg-s-education-record-as-mayor  News Corporation  On November 9, 2010, Bloomberg announced that Klein would resign as chancellor and would take a position as an executive vice president for News Corporation. Klein's date of departure was not immediately clear but it was later announced that he would be gone at the end of the year. He was replaced by Cathie Black, chairman of Hearst Magazines and former president of USA Today, on January 3, 2011. On July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would \\"provide important oversight and guidance\\" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at News of the World. Klein and fellow director Viet D. Dinh took over the investigation from News International UK Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator. Since joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011, NYCDoE Communications Director Natalie Ravitz announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools, a nonprofit, non-partisan news website that reports on the New York City schools, \\"Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company's growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department's former chief operating officer, to become the division's COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city's school data warehouse.\\" In 2016, Klein became a ‚Äútop executive‚Äù with New York health insurance start-up Oscar, which has a focus on technology.  Personal life  Klein is married to Nicole Seligman, general counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.

He was a prolific contributor to the field for six decades, having authored or coauthored several dozen research papers and monographs. The general theme of his career had been abstract homotopy theory. Career He received his Ph.D. at Hebrew University in 1955, under the direction of Samuel Eilenberg. His students include Aldridge K. Bousfield, William Dwyer, Stewart Priddy, and Jeffrey H. Smith. He was an emeritus professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught since the early 1960s. Work He played a role in the beginnings of modern homotopy theory perhaps analogous to that of Saunders Mac Lane in homological algebra, namely the adroit and persistent application of categorical methods. His most famous work is the abstract formulation of the discovery of adjoint functors, which dates from 1958. The Kan extension is one of the broadest descriptions of a useful general class of adjunctions. From the mid-1950s he made distinguished contributions to the theory of simplicial sets and simplicial methods in topology in general. In recognition of this, fibrations in the usual closed model category structure on the category of simplicial sets are known as Kan fibrations, and the fibrant objects are known as Kan complexes. Some of Kan's later work concerned model categories and other homotopical categories. Especially noteworthy are his work with Aldridge Bousfield on completions and homotopy limits, and his work with William Dwyer on simplicial localizations of relative categories.

He played with the punk rock/horror punk band AFI for most of their early career, from 1992 through 1997, and co-wrote the majority of their early material alongside frontman Davey Havok. During an AFI hiatus in 1993, he briefly moved to New York to join street punk band Blanks 77. He later went on to play with Canadian horror rock group The Forbidden Dimension and also a high-energy rock band, The Daggers, before subsequently joining the psychobilly band Tiger Army. Though he played an electric bass in his previous bands, for Tiger Army he chose an upright bass. Career Kresge joined Tiger Army in 1999 just as the band became a full-time touring band, hitting the road in support of their debut album. He appeared as standup bassist on the band's next two full-length albums, Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite and Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise, and in each of the videos from those records. In September 2004 he announced his departure from Tiger Army. He cofounded the band Viva Hate with longtime friend Matt \\"Wedge\\" Wedgley (formerly of The Force) and joined the HorrorPops on guitar, not long afterward. He cowrote and played guitar on the band's second album, Bring It On!. In July 2007, Kresge announced that he had left HorrorPops and disbanded Dead Body Records, stating that he wished to dedicate full attention to Viva Hate, which was followed by an American tour in support of Sick of it All and Madball.

In 1961 and 1966 the monthly magazine was temporarily banned by the French government. Hara-Kiri Hebdo becomes Charlie Hebdo In November 1970, following the death of Charles de Gaulle at his home in Colombey-les-Deux-√âglises, the weekly Hara-Kiri Hebdo bore the headline ¬´ Bal tragique √† Colombey : 1 mort ¬ª (Eng: \\"Tragic ball in Colombey: 1 death\\"). By way of contradistinction, the choice of the title refers to the far greater loss of life the same month: a fire at a discoth√®que in which 146 people died. The government felt this editorial choice was an offence of l√®se-majest√© against the deceased President and its then minister of the interior Raymond Marcellin ordered an immediate and permanent ban on publicity and on sale to minors.

It has survived from the 1970s until today in various forms and presentations. It has slowly evolved into a concept that recognises and accepts large scale plate motions such as envisaged by plate tectonics, but placing them in a framework where large mantle plumes are the major driving force of the system.Van Bemmelen, R.W. (1976); Plate Tectonics and the Undation Model: a comparison. Tectonophysics, 32, 145‚Äì182. The initial followers of the concept during the first half of the 20th Century are scientists like Beloussov and van Bemmelen, and recently the concept has gained interest especially in Japan, through new compiled work on palaeomagnetism, and is still advocaded by the group of scientists elaboration upon Earth expansion.Wezel, F.-C. (1988, Ed.); The origin and evolution of arcs. Tectonophysics, Vol. 146, No.1-4, Special Issue. It is nowadays generally not accepted as the main theory to explain the driving forces of tectonic plate movements, although numerous modulations on the concept have been proposed. The theory focuses on the movements of mantle plumes under tectonic plates, viewing them as the major driving force of movements of (parts of) the Earth's crust. In its more modern form, conceived in the 1970s, it tries to reconcile in one single geodynamic model the horizontalistic concept of Plate tectonics, and the verticalistic concepts of mantle plumes, by the gravitational movement of plates away from major domes of the Earth's crust. The existence of various supercontinents in Earth history and their break-up has been associated recently with major upwellings of the mantle. It is classified together with mantle convection as one of the mechanism that are used to explain the movements of tectonic plates. It also shows affinity with the concept of hot spots which is used in modern-day plate teconics to generate a framework of specific mantle upwelling points that are relatively stable throughout time and are used to calibrate the plate movements using their location together with paleomagnetic data. Another affinity is the concept of surge tectonics which envisage flows through the mantle as major driving forces of Plate Tectonics.

Life He initially trained as an actor at Central School of Speech and Drama. In 1963 he was part of the breakaway group of Central staff and students who formed Drama Centre London. After several small parts as actor he began his collaboration with British television director Alan Clarke in 1981. Their film Made in Britain was critically acclaimed and marked the beginning of the career of actor Tim Roth. Made in Britain won the Prix Italia (an international Television award) in 1984. In 1986 he wrote the screenplay for the thriller-drama Mona Lisa, featuring Bob Hoskins. This film was critically acclaimed and Leland earned nominations for the Golden Globe and the Writers Guild of America. He then wrote Personal Services in 1986. It was directed by Terry Jones and was about Cynthia Payne, a real-life British madam who ran a private brothel. Julie Walters took the leading role. While Personal Services dealt with the adult life of Cynthia Payne, Leland's next film, Wish You Were Here, concerned her teenage years. This film was a success at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and it made the young British actress Emily Lloyd a star. It was awarded the FIPRESCI-Award at Cannes and the BAFTA for best screenplay. In 1991, Leland directed the very successful stage musical A Tribute to the Blues Brothers, which played on the West End and then toured for ten years in the UK and Australia.https://cdn.casarotto.co.uk/files/cvs/David- Leland.pdf?mtime=20200103153048 Leland's next two films, Checking Out (with Jeff Daniels) and The Big Man (with Liam Neeson), failed at the box office and with the critics but have since been successful in the private market. In 1997, Leland co-wrote and directed The Land Girls starring Rachel Weisz and Anna Friel and, in 2000, wrote and directed Episode 6 of the enormously successful HBO Miniseries Band of Brothers. In 2012, Leland joined the Showtime series The Borgias as co-showrunner and executive producer (alongside Neil Jordan, whom he had worked with on 1986's Mona Lisa), writing the last five episodes of its second season and directing its last two episodes. He described his stint as co-showrunner and executive producer as a \\"hands-on\\" experience and having to commit to extensive research on the Renaissance. After the death of his friend George Harrison, Leland was closely involved in the former Beatle's memorial, Concert for George, and directed a cinematic documentary of the night to be put on general release, the DVD of which went platinum. The documentary also won a Grammy Award. His latest project is the Dino De Laurentiis produced Virgin Territory, which is scheduled for a theatrical release in September 2007. David Leland is married to Sabrina Canale (whom he met in Italy during the shooting of \\"Virgin Territory\\") and has five children from his previous marriage: Chlo√´ (seen in Wish You Were Here), Abigail (seen in Wish You Were Here), Rosie, Jacob (seen in The Land Girls), and Grace (seen in The Land Girls).

It was authorized by the United States Congress under the Internal Revenue Code, section 402A,26 U.S. Code ¬ß 402A - Optional treatment of elective deferrals as Roth contributions and represents a unique combination of features of the Roth IRA and a traditional 401(k) plan. Since January 1, 2006, U.S. employers have been allowed to amend their 401(k) plan document to allow employees to elect Roth IRA type tax treatment for a portion or all of their retirement plan contributions. The same change in law allowed Roth IRA type contributions to 403(b) retirement plans. The Roth retirement plan provision was enacted as a provision of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA 2001). Traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA plans In a traditional 401(k) plan, introduced by Congress in 1978, employees contribute pre-tax earnings to their retirement plan, also called \\"elective deferrals\\". That is, an employee's elective deferral funds are set aside by the employer in a special account where the funds are allowed to be invested in various options made available in the plan. The IRS sets a limit on the amount of funds deferred in this way, and includes a \\"catch up\\" provision intended to allow older workers to save for their approaching retirement. These limits are adjusted each year to reflect changes in the cost of living due to inflation. For tax-year 2019, this limit is $19,000 for those under age 50, and $25,000 for those 50 and over.(IRS) Employers may also add funds to the account by contributing matching funds on a fractional formula basis (e.g., matching funds might be added at the rate of 50% of employees' elective deferrals), or on a set percentage basis. Funds within the 401(k) account grow on a tax deferred basis. When the account owner reaches the age of 59¬Ω, he or she may begin to receive \\"qualified distributions\\" from the funds in the account; these distributions are then taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Exceptions exist to allow distribution of funds before 59¬Ω, such as \\"substantially equal periodic payments\\", disability, and separation from service after the age of 55, as outlined under IRS Code section 72(t). Under a Roth IRA, first enacted in 1998, individuals, whether employees or self-employed, voluntarily contribute post-tax funds to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth and distribution, provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years and the account owner has reached age 59¬Ω. Roth IRA contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. And 2019 allows contributions up to $7,000 under age 50.IRA Contribution Limits Additionally, Roth IRA contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with a Modified Adjusted Gross Income (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016. See 401(k) versus IRA matrix that compares various types of IRAs with various types of 401(k)s. Roth 401(k) plans The Roth 401(k) combines some of the most advantageous aspects of both the 401(k) and the Roth IRA. Under the Roth 401(k), employees may contribute funds on a post-tax elective deferral basis, in addition to or instead of pre-tax elective deferrals under their traditional 401(k) plans. An employee's combined elective deferrals whether to a traditional 401(k), a Roth 401(k), or both cannot exceed the IRS limits for deferral of the traditional 401(k). Employers' matching funds are not included in the elective deferral cap but are considered for the maximum section 415 limit, which is $53,000 for 2015 and 2016, or $59,000 for those age 50 and older. The higher section 415 limit also applies to after tax contributions, which, depending on the specific 401(k), might be convertible into a Roth 401(k) later. Employers are permitted to make matching contributions on employees' designated Roth contributions. However, employers' contributions cannot receive the Roth tax treatment. The matching contributions made on account of designated Roth contributions must be allocated to a pre-tax account, just as matching contributions are on traditional, pre-tax elective contributions. (Pub 4530) In general, the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) is that income contributed to the Roth version is taxable in the year it is earned, but income contributed to the traditional version is taxable in the year in which it is distributed from the account. Furthermore, earnings on the traditional version are taxable income in the year they are distributed, but earnings on the Roth version are never taxable. There are restrictions on the nontaxability of Roth earnings: typically, the distribution must be made at least 5 years after the first Roth contribution and after the recipient is age 59 ¬Ω. A Roth 401(k) plan is probably most advantageous to those who might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets is the future of income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals. Adoption of Roth 401(k) plans has been relatively slow, partly because they require additional administrative recordkeeping and payroll processing.Wait-and-see stance for Roth 401(k), Andrea Coombes 2005 However some larger firms have now adopted Roth 401(k) plans, which is expected to spur their adoption by other firms including smaller ones.A New Type of 401(k) Picks Up Steam, Jeff D.

They traditionally inhabited portions of several regional waterways, including the Klamath, Salmon, Sacramento and McCloud rivers. Shastan lands presently form portions of the Siskiyou, Klamath and Jackson counties. Scholars have generally divided the Shastan peoples into four languages, although arguments in favor of more or less existing have been made. Speakers of Shasta proper-Kahosadi, Konomihu, Okwanuchu, and Tlohomtah‚Äôhello \\"New River\\" Shasta resided in settlements typically near a water source. Their villages often had only either one or two families. Larger villages had more families and additional buildings utilised by the community. The California Gold Rush drew in an influx of outsiders into California in the late 1840s eager to gain mineral wealth. For the Shasta, this was a devastating process as their lands soon had thousands of miners operating along various waterways. Conflicts arose as the outsiders didn't respect the Shasta or their homeland. Introduction to new diseases and fighting against invading Americans rapidly reduced the number of Shasta. The Shasta residents of Bear Creek were active in Rogue River Wars and assisted the Takelma until they were forcibly removed to the Grande Ronde and Siletz Reservations in Oregon. In the late 1850s the Shastan peoples of California were forcibly removed from their territories and also sent to the same two distant reservations. By the early years of the 20th century perhaps only 100 Shasta individual existed. Some Shasta descendants still reside at the Grand Ronde and Siletz Reservations, while others are in Siskiyou county at the Quartz Valley Indian Reservation or Yreka. Many former members of the Shasta tribe have also been inducted into the Karuk and Alturas tribes. Origin of name Prior to contact with European descendants the term Shasta likely wasn't used by the Shastan peoples themselves. Among the Shasta proper they called themselves \\"Kahosadi\\" or \\"plain speakers\\". Variations of Shasta used by whites include Chasta, Shasty, Tsashtl, Sasti, and Saste. Dixon noted that the Shastan peoples didn't use \\"Shasta\\" as a place name and likely wasn't a word at all in their languages. In interviews with Shasta informants Dixon was informed of a prominent man of Scott Valley that lived up until the 1850s with the name of Susti or Sustika. This was the probable origin of the term according to Dixon, an interpretation that Kroeber agreed with. Merriam reviewed information from Albert Samuel Gatschet and fur trader Peter Skene Ogden, concluding that while the Shastan peoples didn't refer to themselves as Shasta traditionally; the nearby Klamath likely did. Scholars have largely accepted Dixon's etymology for Shasta. Renfro questions its validity however as Ogden used a variation of the term before Sustika was likely prominent. In 1814, near the Willamette Trading Post a meeting occurred between North West Company officer Alexander Henry and an assembled Sahaptin congregation of Cayuse and Walla Walla, in addition to a third group of people that was named Shatasla. Maloney argued that Shatasla was an archaic variant of Shasta. something Garth later conjectured as well. This interpretation has been contested by other scholars based on linguistic and historical evidence. Previous to Maloney's assertion, Frederick Hodge in 1910 noted the word Shatalsa as being related to word Sahaptin. This older etymology was defended by Stern against Maloney's interpretation, in addition to recently being accepted by Clark as well. Social organization Mount Shasta is a prominent landmark among the Siskiyou Mountains and has cultural significance for the Shasta. The Shasta were the numerically largest of the Shastan speakers. Their territories spread from around modern Ashland in the north, Jenny Creek and Mount Shasta to the east, southward to the Scott Mountains, and westward to modern Seiad Valley and the Salmon and Marble Mountains. This area had four important waterways, each of which had a distinct group of resident Shasta. These were the Klamath River and two of its tributaries, the Shasta River and Scott River, along with the Bear Creek in the Rogue Valley. Four bands of Shasta existed with variations in custom and differing dialects. Each band had names derived from nearby waterways. In this way people from Shasta River or Ahotidae were the \\"Ahotireitsu\\", those from the Upper Rogue Valley or Ikiruk were the \\"Ikirukatsu\\", and inhabitants of Scott River or Iraui were the \\"Irauitsu\\". Shasta families located directly along the Klamath River were referred to by the Ikirukatsu as \\"Wasudigwatsu\\" after their particular words for the Klamath River and gulch. The Irauistu knew them as \\"Wiruwhikwatsu\\" and the Ahotireitsu called them \\"Wiruwhitsu\\", terms derived from \\"down river\\" and \\"up river\\" respectively. Shasta settlements often only contained a single family. In larger villages headmen held sway. The responsibilities of this position were varied. They were expected \\"to exhort the people to live in peace, do good, have kind hearts, and be industrious.\\" A common requirement to hold the position was that the individual had to be materially wealthy. This came from the expectation for them to use their property in negotiations to settles disputes between members of their village or with other settlements. In raids on enemies the headman did not participate but negotiated with enemy headmen to establish peaceable relations. Each of the four Shasta bands had individual headmen as well. While only the Ikirukatsu were reported to have had hereditary succession to the position it is thought the other three bands had some form hereditarian succession as well. While each of the four band headmen were considered equal, in particularly trying disputes the Ikirukatsu headman would negotiate an end to the issue. =Affiliated peoples= Three related groups of Shastan speakers resided adjacent to the Shasta proper. These were the Okwanuchu of the upper Sacramento and McCloud rivers, and the Salmon River based Konomihu and Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta. There is little recorded information on the Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta, Konomihu and Okwanuchu. Merriam concluded that \\"any extended discussion of their culture, customs, beliefs, and ceremonies is out of the question...\\" Each group had particularly small territories. The Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta held , the Okwanuchu had , and the Konomihu only occupied . The Shasta called the Konomihu \\"Iw√°ppi\\", related to the term used for the Karuk. The Konomihu referred to themselves as \\"·∏∞unumm√≠hiwu\\". They inhabited portions of the north and south forks of the Salmon River, in addition to part of the combined waterway. Seventeen settlements are recorded to have existed within Konomihu territory. Political authority was more fragmented than the Shasta, reportedly there being no form of appointed or hereditary village headmen. Most knowledge of Konomihu interactions with neighboring peoples has been lost. It is known that despite occasional disputes with the Irauitsu Shasta, intermarriage was common. The Irauitsu appear to have been important trading partners as well. In return for their buckskin garments the Konomihu received abalone beads. It is not known what the autonym of the Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta was. However it is known that the Shasta likely referred to them as \\"tax¬∑a¬∑ î√°ycu\\", the Hupa called them \\"Y…®dahƒç…®n\\" or \\"those from upcountry (away from the stream)\\", while the Karok called them \\"K√†¬∑sah î√°ra¬∑ra\\" or \\"person of ka¬∑sah\\". The Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta largely lived in the Salmon River basin despite the scholarly appellation, though they did reside on the forks of the New River. There were at least five reported settlements inhabited by Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta according to information gained from particular informants. Residents of the New River forks were proposed by Merriam to speak a distinct language from the Salmon River inhabitants. Dixon criticized the idea and presented evidence for the linguistic unity of the cultural group. Merriam's conclusion of there being two differing languages between the Tlohomtah‚Äôhoi Shasta group has not been adopted by other scholars. What information has been preserved about the Okwanuchu amounts to little. The origin of the word Okwanuchu is unknown. They were called \\"ye¬∑tatwa\\" and \\"Ikusadewi\\" by the Achomawi. Intermarriage between Okwanuchu and Achomawi speakers was apparently common. =Population= Estimates for historic Shasta, Okwanuchu, New River Shasta, and Konomihu population figures have substantially varied, as is true for most native groups in California. In the 1990s some Shasta stated upwards of 10,000 Shastan peoples lived in the 1840s. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Shasta proper as 2,000 and the New River, Konomihu, and Okwanuchu groups, along with the Chimariko, as 1,000. Using population information on a nearby culture, Sherburne F. Cook largely agreed with Kroeber and concluded there were about 2,210 Shasta proper and another 1,000 related peoples. Subsequently, however Cook raised the figure to 5,900 total Shasta, inclusive of the smaller related cultures. Kroeber estimated the population of the Shasta proper in 1910 as 100. Historic culture=Diet= Coho salmon were traditionally a major source of nutrition for the Shasta. The Shastan peoples had a diet based around locally available food sources. Many plant and animal species that existed in Shasta territories were located in adjacent areas. These food sources were commonly gathered and used by the Shasta and other regional cultures. The large populations of game animals in the Shasta territories led to many confrontation from other California Natives keen on gaining animal meat and pelts. Strategies to procure and later store these foodstuffs shared similarities with adjoining cultures. Undergrowth in forests was removed with controlled fires to promote advantageous plant species that were often food sources. Fishing runs began in the spring and continued throughout the summer and autumn. The White Deerskin dance by the Karuk determined the appropriate time for the Shasta to eat fish. Held sometime in July, the dance was an important event for Shasta to witness and known as \\"kuwarik\\". Prior to the event Coho salmon could be caught and dried, but not consumed. Rainbow trout had to be released before the Karuk dance. Not doing so was seen as particularly egregious and made one liable to be killed. Spears were reportedly uncommon for use in fishing among the Shasta. Fires were created and maintained at weirs to enable efficient night fishing. Fishing nets designs were near identical to those created by Karuk and Yurok. Catfish and crawfish were caught with bait tied to lines. Once stuck on the line, the prey would be captured with a thin basket. California mule deer were hunted according to one of several strategies employed by the Shasta. In the autumn at mineral licks deer were forced by controlled burning of oak leaves into gaps between the flames where hunters would wait. Shasta also chased deer into nooses that were tied to trees. Alternatively dogs were trained to chase deer into creeks. Hidden until their prey was in the water, Shasta hunters would then kill the deer with arrows. There were a number of societal conventions related to the ownership of the deer. For example, whoever killed the prey had right to its pelt and hind legs. Other reported conventions regulated the divisions of meat in a fair manner and when Shasta were allowed to hunt. California Black Oak were commonly consumed, although imported Tan Oak acorns were considered more appetizing. Additional nutritional sources included several smaller animal species. Mussels were collected from the Klamath River by women and children that dived for the organisms. During the autumn the river shrunk in size, leaving exposed populations of mussels along the river banks. Once gathered in a sufficient quantity the mussels steamed in earthen ovens. Then the shells were opened and the meat dried through sunlight for future use. Grasshoppers and crickets were consumed by both the Ahotireitsu and Ikirukatsu Shasta. Parcels of grasslands were set ablaze by Shasta men. After the fires had died down the cooked grasshoppers were collected and dried. When grasshoppers were served with particular grass seeds the insects were pounded into a fine powder. Visitors to Shasta Valley would join Ahotireitsu during periods of abundant insect populations to collect their own food stores. Acorns were a valuable foodstuff in Shasta cuisine. Local sources of the nut included the Canyon Oak, California Black Oak and the Oregon White Oak. After leeching the acorns of tannins the nuts were turned into a dough. Black Oak meal was preferred compared to the slimier and less popular White Oak meal for both consumption and trade. Canyon Oak acorns were often buried and allowed to turn black before being cooked. Often nuts from Sugar pines were steamed, dried and stored for future consumption. Pitch from the Ponderosa pine was pounded into a fine dust and consumed or used as a chewing gum. Many fruits were harvested once ripe and often dried. This included Chokecherries, Whiteleaf manzanita berries, Pacific blackberries, San Diego raspberries, and Blue elderberries. Flower bulbs were gathered seasonally to supplement other food stores. Camas roots were commonly collected. Members of the calochortus genus were known as \\"ipos\\" to the Shasta who relished them. Once the bulb was husked ipos roots were consumed raw or dried in sunlight and later stored. Shastan cuisine had many meals that included dried ipos. Guests were often given small servings of serviceberries and dried ipos while the main meal cooked. One particularly popular dish was powdered ipos root mixed into manzanita cider. Another consumed flowering plant species was Fritillaria recurva. Commonly called \\"chwau\\", the bulbs were prepared by either roasting or boiling. =Housing= Yurok winter dwelling. Shasta residencies were largely the same in design. Shasta architecture appears to have large been derived from the downriver Hupa, Karuk and Yurok peoples. Permanent houses were constructed by the Shasta for the winter. These dwellings were built in the same locations annually, commonly near a creek. Klamath River Shasta winter villages commonly had only 3 families, while Dixon has suggested that both Irauitsu and Ahotireitsu villages usually had more families. The beginning of a winter house started with excavating a pit. Common dimensions rectangular or oval shaped excavation were by , with a depth of . Once the area was cleared load bearing wooden poles were placed in the excavated corners. Additional wooden supports and posts placed throughout the structure. After the pit walls were covered with cedar-bark, the sugar-pine or cedar wooden roof was finally put into place. The okw√°'≈≠mma (\\"big house\\") was a structure maintained in populous Shasta villages. A pit up to wide, wide and deep was dug, with a building process similar to winter dwellings employed. Their functionality was primarily for assemblies, such as seasonal religious ceremonies and dances. Dixon incorrectly reported that okw√°'≈≠mma were used as sweat houses. If a villager had too many guests for their house, permission would be secured to use the okw√°'≈≠mma instead. Okw√°'≈≠mma were owned by a prominent individual, often the headman, and constructed with communal labor. They were uncommon buildings, as along the Klamath River perhaps only three existed. Male relatives of the owner inherited the structure, if only female relatives remained it was burnt down. Dwellings utilized by the Konomihu varied according to season like the Shasta. During the salmon runs of spring and summer huts created from plant brush were used. These were abandoned in the autumn in favor of bark houses while deer were hunted. These winter houses were markedly different from the Shasta, Karuk and Yurok. While partially underground their houses were built in 15 to 18 foot wide circles with sloped conical roofs. =Manufactured items= An assembled collection of Karuk made baskets. These were quite popular among the Shasta and frequently purchased. Basketry hat, attributed to the Shasta, made before 1916 from plant fibers An important item for Shasta households were baskets which principally came from the Karuk. The Konomihu likewise largely imported their baskets from abroad. Baskets made by Shasta were generally a composite of plant materials gathered from the Ponderosa pine, California hazelnut, several species of Willow, Bear grass, and the Five-fingered fern. Their designs took influences from the nearby Hupa, Karuk and Yurok peoples. Pigments were made by the Shasta for the beautification of baskets and other personal possessions. Red and black dyes were the most commonly used and come from acorns and alder bark respectively. Ropes, cordage and manufactured goods such as mats, nets and clothing were largely derived from Indian hemp. During the winter snow shoes were often necessary to traverse their homeland. These were made primarily from deer hide with the fur left on. Dentalium shells were an important possession for the Shasta. Principally they were used for ornamentation through being sown into clothing, in addition to usage as a bartering medium. Konomihu produced buckskin leggings, robes and skirts that were painted with black, red and white patterns and adorned with dentalia and abalone beads. Okwanuchu crafted tubular wooden pipes similar in design to those made by Wintu. Raccoon and fox pelts were used for protection against the harsh mountain winters. Moccasins were kept waterproof and soft with oils derived from either deer, fish, cougars or bears. Charles Wilkes described Shasta made weaponry in 1845: > \\"Their bows and arrows are beautifully made: the former are of yew and about > three feet long; they are flat, and an inch and a half to two inches wide: > these are backed very neatly with sinew, and painted. The arrows are upwards > of thirty inches long; some of them were made of a close-grained wood, a > species of spiraea, while others were of reed; they were feathered for a > length of from five to eight inches, and the barbed heads were beautifully > wrought from obsidian... Their quivers are made of deer, raccoon, or wild- > cat skin; these skins are generally whole, being left open at the tail end.\\" =Body modification= Body decoration and modification were common practices among the Shasta. For example, they employed dyes of red, yellow, blue, black and white in their artwork. These dyes were created from plant matter and natural clay deposits. Reportedly body painting was largely used by shamans and those preparing for warfare. The latter group generally used white and black colors during their war preparations. Red was applied by shamans upon their buckskins in geometric patterns. Permanent tattooing was performed by elder women who used small obsidian flakes. Tattoos for women were generally several vertical marks on the chin that occasionally were prolonged to the edges of the mouth. Women without chin tattoos were seen as unattractive and targets of ridicule. For men tattoos had an important functionality in bartering and exchanges. Applied in lines on their hands or arms, these lines were used to measure dentalia and beads. Septum piercings were made to hold either a long dentalia shell or ornate feathers, while ear piercings held an assembled group of dentalia. =Warfare= Warfare was principally performed in asymmetrical small raids. Leaders of these attacks were determined by raiding party members. An armed group was organized usually to redress aggression and violence against village members. Prisoners gained in raids were not often killed and instead were allowed to live as a slave. Slavery was reportedly not widespread among the Shasta and wasn't seen as a favorable practice. Dixon stated that \\"persons owning slaves were said to be, in a way, looked down upon.\\" Shasta warriors wore protective adornments when headed into a conflict. Stick armor was preferred over the alternative elkhide. Materials for stick armor were largely sourced from serviceberry trees and woven together tightly with twine. As a rule head coverings were made from elk hide, sometimes placed in several layers thick. Notably Shasta women could join in both preparations for an upcoming attack and as active participants in the battle itself. Dixon recorded in such instances women would be armed with obsidian knives and attempt to disarm or destroy the weapons of enemy combatants. Armed warriors came largely from the Klamath River and Ahotireitsu Shasta in conflicts with the Modoc. These clashes have been speculated to have been the most violent for the Shasta by scholars. While disputes and raids occurred with the Wintu, they were apparently not as destructive as warfare with the Modoc. Attacks on Wintu and Modoc villages included torching the settlement. This was not practiced in raids between Shasta villages. Neighboring societies Yurok man in a redwood canoe. These vehicles were prized among the Shasta. The Shasta were located at the crossroads of several major cultural regions. This was reflected in their neighbors, each with distinct material and cultural conditions. To the southwest on the lower Klamath River were the Karuk, Yurok and Hupa. Past the southern borders of Shasta territory resided the Wintu. They were the northernmost extension of a central Californian culture focused on the Russian River Pomo and the Patwin. To the east and southeast were the Achomawi and Atsugewi, with whom the Shasta have some linguistic affiliations. Kroeber placed the Achomawi and Atsugewi with the northeastern Modoc and Klamath into the \\"Northeast\\" cultural group. They received cultural influences from the Columbia Plateau and Columbia River Sahaptins, far more than the Shasta did. =Klamath River societies= Coming from the Shasta word for \\"down the river\\" the Karuk were known as \\"Iwampi\\". Along with the Yurok, both nations inspired many facets of Shasta society and were their principal trading partners. These peoples were particularly similar to the Shasta and these ethnicities formed the southern terminus \\"of that great and distinctive culture [...] common to all peoples of the Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska.\\" Additional members of this grouping included the Tolowa further to the west and the Takelma located to the north. The Karuk culture was held in a favorable regard by most Shasta, particularly for their manufactured items. Shasta merchants would bring stockpiles of trade goods in demand down river, which included a variety of preserved foodstuffs, animal pelts, and obsidian blades. Merchandise found desirable by the Shasta included Tan Oak acorns, Yurok produced redwood canoes, a gamut of baskets of varying designs, seaweed, dentalia and abalone beads. The Karuk also were the primary source of dentalia for the Konomihu as well. Baskets and hats used by the Shasta were acquired primarily with these Klamath River nations. Dentalium shells were imported from the Takelma, Karuk and Yurok. They were used by the Shasta in personal adornments, artistic additions to clothing or as a trading medium. =Takelma= The delimitation of territory with the Takelma to the north has been a matter of controversy between scholars. Shasta informants told Roland B. Dixon that they previously occupied the Bear Creek Valley southward and eastward of the Table Rocks. He was additionally given Shasta place names of this area. This information was forwarded to Edward Sapir who suggested that the Shasta and Takelma both utilized this disputed region of the Rogue Valley. Alfred Kroeber would in turn claim that Shasta territories extended as far north as modern Trail, Oregon. Based on a review on accounts by Takelma and Shasta informants and the journal of Ogden, Gray has determined and proposed a revised cultural boundary. During the early 19th century the southern Bear Creek valley was used by both the Shasta and Takelma peoples as Sapir had speculated. The higher portions of the local Neil and Emigrant Creeks, in addition to the northern Siskiyou slopes close to Siskiyou Summit were Shasta areas. Regardless of their conflicts over the Bear Creek Valley, the Takelma were active trading partners with the Shasta and were a major source of dentalia. =Lutuamian peoples= Known as the \\"Ipaxanai\\" from the Shasta word for \\"lake\\", the Modoc were traditionally held in low regard and were seen as without much material wealth by the Shasta. For example, a Shasta informant reported that \\"How could you settle anything with them? They didn't have any money.\\" There was an amount of commercial transactions between the Shasta and the Klamath but these were apparently rare occurrences. Spier reported that Shasta manufactured beads were exchanged for animal pelts and blankets. Outside of trading with the Modoc, this was some of the only trading done between the Klamath and the Indigenous peoples of California. Both the Modoc and their Klamath relatives gained horses in the 1820s. This greatly enhanced their military capabilities which began a period of attacks on their southern and western neighbors. Both the Ahotireitsu and Klamath River Shasta bands were targets of Modoc slave raiding. =Achomawi & Atsugewi= The Achomawi and Atsugewi speakers resided to the east in the Pit River basin. Not much has been recorded on interactions the Shasta had with them. It is known that the Shasta were the principal source of dentalia for both peoples. There was some direct contact with the Atsugewi though it was probably minimal. Atsugewi informants agreed that they traditionally had many shared cultural traits with the Shasta especially their similar \\"religion, mythology, social organization, political organization, puberty customs, and paucity of ceremonial.\\" The Madhesi band of Achomawi were known to have had occasional disputes. Villages in the vicinity of modern Big Bend were liable to be raided by Shasta warriors. =Wintu= Bands of Wintu located around modern McCloud, California and in the Upper Sacramento Valley had the majority of interactions with the Shasta. While clashes did occur with Wintu speakers, it wasn't nearly as common as conflict with the Modoc. These conflicts earned the Shasta the Wintun name of \\"yuki\\" or \\"enemy\\". Despite the occasional skirmish there was some commercial and cultural exchanges between the peoples. The Wintu were an active source of Tan oak acorns and abalone beads. The Shasta were the primary distributors of dentalia to the Wintu, along with some obsidian and buckskin. A drink made by both the Shasta and the Wintu was a cider created from Manzanita berries. Members of both cultures were inspired by the manufactured goods created by the other nation. Ahotireitsu Shasta considered clothing made by Wintu fashionable and made hats from Indian hemp after their style. Upper Sacramento Valley and McCloud Wintu admired the smooth headgear used by the Shasta. These twine hats were copied by the Wintu, who used material from Woodwardia ferns in their reproductions more often than among their own designs. Early nineteenth century Originating from the Chinook Jargon word for an American, \\"Boston,\\" the Shasta word for whites is \\"pastin.\\" The Shasta were isolated from the Spanish to the south and their Californian colonies. When the Mexican War of Independence erupted Mexican officials assumed control of the Spanish settlements and missions by forming the Alta California territory. This didn't change matters for the natives north of the Californian Ranchos as they maintained their territorial autonomy and protected position against European descendants. Sometime around the 1820s the Modoc and Klamath adopted horses from the Sahaptin peoples to the north. With their new equestrian rides they began to attack the Shasta, Achomawi and Atsugewi for property, food stores and slaves to be sold at the Dalles. The Shasta actively fought against the invaders although they didn't gain sizable numbers of horses. The first recorded encounter with European descendants for the Shasta came in 1826. A Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) expedition under Peter Skene Ogden departed from Fort Vancouver to trap beavers in the Klamath Mountains. Arriving from the east, Ogden's party was favorably received by Shasta. Ogden was disappointed by the small number of beaver in the mountainous region and shifted the party north to the Rogue Valley across the Siskiyous. Shasta guides accompanied them until shortly before modern Talent. The HBC continued to send expeditions southward through the Klamath Mountains to harvest beaver populations in Alta California. These groups of fur trappers and their families traveled along the Siskiyou Trail which traversed portions of the Shasta homelands. The following known interaction with whites wasn't peaceable as Ogden's visit had been. A group of Willamette Valley colonists traversed Shasta territories in the autumn of 1837. With them were several hundred cattle purchased from Alta California Governor Alvarado. Driving their herd north along the Siskiyou Trail, they encountered several Shasta settlements. The Shasta were welcoming to the outsiders despite difficulties in communication. Philip Leget Edwards recorded that the cattle drivers were \\"at their mercy, but they have offered no injury to ourselves or property.\\" A Shasta boy estimated by Edwards to be the age of ten accompanied the settlers for some time. As the group continued north some of the cattle men began to discuss killing natives of the area. William J. Bailey and George K. Gay had previously had fought against a group of Takelma of the Rogue Valley, getting injured and losing several companions. They considered the Shasta to be acceptable targets to attack for revenge. A Shasta man was found and shot to death by Gay and Bailey. They also attempted to murder the Shasta youth that had joined the cattle herders but he escaped. While officer Ewing Young was furious at the murder, the majority of the party condoned the murder. Bailey and Gay faced no punishment for their actions and the party continued toward the Willamette Valley. Several years later a portion of the United States Exploring Expedition under the command of Lieutenant George F. Emmons (1838-1842) visited the Klamath Mountains. Emmons had been given instructions by Charles Wilkes to explore the headwaters of the Klamath, Sacramento, and Umpqua rivers. The assembled men had departed from Fort Vancouver to Fort Umpqua during the summer of 1841. During September and October they traveled through Shasta territories by generally following the Siskiyou Trail. On 1 October the party crossed the Klamath River. The explorers visited a Shasta village where inhabitants gave them salmon and sold several yew bows and arrows in exchange for trade goods. Inhabitants of the village demonstrated their archery skills by repeatedly shooting a button from distant. At this demonstration was an elder Shasta man who was a father-in-law to Michel Laframboise. Shortly after this peaceable dialogue and trade Emmons ordered the party to depart for \\"Destruction river\\" (the Upper Sacramento River) exiting Shasta lands for those of the Okwanuchu and later the Wintu. =Discovery of gold= Sluices and other techniques used to acquire gold dust contributed to the degradation of fish habitat in the Klamath River basin, in addition to causing other environmental destruction of the watershed. The irregular contact with European descendants became far more frequent by the 1840s. Military forces of the United States conquered Alta California during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. American control was initially limited to areas that had been administered by the Mexican government. The California Territory was established in 1849 although much of the claimed land still remained in indigenous hands. The California State Legislature organized Shasta County in 1850. Once it was firmly in control by American colonists it was speculated to become an important region for its agricultural and mineral potential. In 1852 Siskiyou County was formed from the northern portions of Shasta County. This new American division contained the Shasta homelands of California. The lure of achieving material wealth created the California Gold Rush and drew in outsiders by the hundreds of thousands. The newly arriving miners and colonists had little respect for California Natives and frequently spread violence against indigenous peoples. Miners progressively went north from Sutter's Mill in search of more gold. During 1850 discoveries of gold were made on the Trinity and Klamath rivers. In the Shasta heartland along the banks of the Salmon, Scott and upper Klamath gold was found during the following two years. Incoming miners founded the towns of Scott Bar and Yreka near these newer sources. The Shasta weren't seen favorably by incoming miners, being considered to have \\"inherited a spirit of warfare, and delight in [...] perilous incidents of daring thefts or bold fighting. This image of native aggression was repeatedly mentioned in contemporary newspapers. The Shasta and other natives in the north were apparently found to be \\"more warlike than those of any other section of the State, and bear the most implacable hatred towards all pale faces.\\" By August 1850 there were over 2,000 miners prospecting on Klamath and Salmon rivers. Over a hundred miles of the Klamath River had been searched for gold deposits and portions were occupied by mining operations. While the Shasta River hadn't yet been exploited it was considered by miners to contain rich gold deposits. In the winter of 1850 advertisements appeared in the Daily Alta California promoting the mineral potential of the Klamath River basin. These notices appealed for Americans to venture north where opportunities for acquiring wealth abound. In addition to maintaining extensive mining operations, whites began to cut forests down for sale in Sacramento. A thousand acres of Shasta river had been prospected to varying amounts by April 1851. Scott River became touted as having \\"the richest mines in all California.\\" Contemporaries described an influx of miners into the northern region. \\"The tide of emigration to Scott's River [...] flows due north, sweeping everything in its way...\\" Redick McKee visited the Scott River in October 1851. He reported that \\"squatter' tents and cabins may be seen on almost every little patch or strip where the soil promises a reward to cultivation.\\" Additionally he noted the Scott River was under heavy modification by miners. \\"Every yard almost for three or four miles is either dam or race work.\\" As the population of non-natives rose in the north genocide of the indigenous was considered. Miners argued that natives along the Klamath River and its tributaries impeded access to gold deposits. They were deemed \\"the only obstacle to complete success in those mines.\\" The Sacramento Daily Union argued that \\"the Indians must soon be removed by the Government Agents, or be exterminated by the sword of the whites.\\" Violence and murder against natives were often promoted as the only way to end their \\"thieving and other annoying propensities.\\" Violence began to erupt across the Klamath River in the summer of 1850. In August it was reported that miners had killed fifty to sixty Hupa and burnt down three of their villages around the juncture of the Klamath and Trinity rivers. At the junction of the Shasta and Klamath rivers in October a confrontation erupted in which miners killed six Shasta. Federal peace effort The Indian Superintendency gave a report to Congress in November 1848. It was an overview on native population figures in the recently gained Pacific Coast and Southwest. Congress was advised to fund and hire new Indian agents in these new territories. A report presented to Congress in 1850 by William Carey Jones surmised information he gathered on land title in California. Jones concluded that Spanish and Mexican law didn't recognize the right of natives to owning their homelands. After the admission of California as an American state the topic of relations with its indigenous peoples was raised in the Senate once more. Charles Fremont presented legislation that promoted the forced seizure of their lands for resale to American colonists. He however felt that the natives had legal right to their own territories and had to be compensated for their territorial losses. This was far from a universal opinion in the Senate as some legislators felt California Indigenous had no legal right to their own homelands. In September the Senate passed two bills that formulated Federal policy with Californian Natives. Three commissioners were authorized to draft treaties with California Natives. Redick McKee, O. M. Wozencraft, and George W. Barbour were appointed and began negotiations in 1851. However they collectively lacked expertise and familiarity with either California natives or how their societies utilized their territories. The Commissioners eventually divided California into three areas to cover the large amount of travelling necessary to create treaties with every native group. This meant they were operating independent of each other. McKee was assigned the task of creating treaties with natives of Northern California. He and his entourage created agreements with natives in Humboldt Bay and the lower Klamath River. Later in September 1851 he arrived in Shasta territory. =Local conditions= McKee toured the Shasta territories; inspecting the Shasta and Scott vallies in particular. It was concluded that only the Scott could support a reservation and the agricultural work necessary to feed the Shasta. This assessment was due to the scarcity of agriculturally viable land in the Klamath Mountains. More promising areas did exist nearby but they were in Oregon. The Shasta wanted to retain the entirety of Scott Valley for their designated reservation. American colonists from Scott Bar and Shasta Butte City contended for possession of the valley as well. Federal officials consulted with them for what they desired in a treaty with the Shasta. They called for the removal of all Shasta to a reservation placed on the headwaters of the Shasta River. =Gibbs proposal= George Gibbs was a member of McKee's delegation and left a record of its activities. There was a repeating cycle of violence and reprisals then ongoing in northern California. Local American militias were reported to be excessively violent in \\"revenging outrages\\" supposedly committed by natives. Gibbs argued for the establishment of US Army post at or near the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. He felt it was necessary to maintain peaceable relations between the colonists and various natives peoples in the Klamath Basin. The government was suggested to model its native policies in Northern California after those of employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the Columbia Department. Select individuals would be given material patronage which would assist them in gaining prominence among their local settlements. This in turn would simplify interactions with various native cultures as power gradually centralized under amendable leadership. There wasn't a fort located in this vicinity until 1858, when Fort Gaston was established in modern Hoopa. =Treaty= The terms drafted by McKee for an agreement were not particularly favored by the Shasta or American settlers. The reservation was placed in Scott Valley although the majority of the valley was to remain in colonist possession. The location of the Shasta reservation was apparently accepted, albeit grudgingly, by most American colonists of the area. Some had purchased expensive land grants from other Americans. A variation of the Donation Land Claim Act was expected to soon be enacted in California. Financial compensation from Congress or the Indian Department was expected by Americans with properties within the reservation boundaries. The area specified in the treaty for the reservation was estimated by McKee to contain four or five square miles of arable land. The Shasta were promised to receive \\"free of charge\\" 20,000 pounds of flour, 200 cattle, a large inventory of garments, and a multitude of household goods from the Federal government throughout 1852 and 1853. Funding was to be appropriated in Congress for employing a carpenter, a group of farmers and several teachers on the reservation. Prospecting along the Scott river was to be allowed for two additional years. Any additional mining operations within the reservation had a single year to continue. At the end of the discussions a bull was presented to the Shasta. A celebration was held which lasted late into the evening. Gibbs recorded the day assigned for the formal signing of the treaty: > \\"In the morning, November 4th, the treaty was explained carefully as drawn > up and the bounds of the reservation pointed out on a plat. In the afternoon > it was signed in the presence of a large concourse of whites and Indians, > with great formality.\\" =Alleged poisoning= Some ethnographic informants gave accounts of three thousand Shasta being present at the ceremony. They were reportedly served beef poisoned with strychnine by American officials. Survivors told of spending weeks locating the deceased. Only around 150 Shasta were said to have survived. =Failure= The treaties negotiated by McKee, Barbour, and Wozencraft amounted to 18. McKee pressed for the California legislature to accept the treaties. He argued the reservations were designed to allocate natives to keep portions of their traditional lands while keeping open the many areas bearing gold. The commissioners were stated to have always consulted with local American colonists and miners in establishing the borders of each reservation. Pointedly he went on to argue that unless if someone were to \\"propose a more humane and available system\\" the reservations had to be acknowledged by the California Government. The state rejected all treaties and instructed its representatives in Washington, D.C. to lobby against them as well. The treaties were endorsed by President Millard Fillmore, commissioner of Indian affairs Luke Lea and the recently appointed superintendent of Indian affairs for California Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The treaties were sent the Committee on Indian Affairs in June 1852. After a closed session the treaties were rejected. Ellison suggested that the vast amount of land set aside by the treaties and the expenditures allocated by the commissioners made the agreements unpopular in Congress. In total about or about 7% of the total land area of California was to contain the 18 reservations. Heizer concluded that the process of drafting treaties made by the Commissioners and their eventual rejection in the U.S. Congress \\"was a farce from beginning to end...\\" Continued conflicts Violence against the Shasta continued after the agreement with McKee. On 18 January 1852 three American men attacked and killed a Shasta individual without provocation on Humbug Creek. A panic arose among the local Shasta who fled into the nearby mountains. This senseless killing caused a panic among the miners. They feared that this breach of the new treaty would provoke conflict with the Shasta. McKee was requested to return to the area and mediate a solution. Although one of the murderers escaped two of the men were captured by the miners. The slain man's familial relations were given six blankets as compensation pending a ruling of the three murderers. In July 1852 a party of miners found and killed fourteen Shasta people in Shasta Valley in revenge for the murder of a white man. This escalation of violence continued to deplete the number of Shasta. Their reprisals against white violence were to protect \\"their communities from assault, abduction, unfree labor, rape, murder, massacre, and, ultimately, obliteration.\\" Americans in Cottonwood organized the \\"Squaw Hunters\\" in January 1854. It was an armed group made to \\"get squaws, by force, if necessary‚Ä¶\\" That month they went to a nearby cave where over 50 Shasta were residing. The Squaw Hunters attacked the Shasta there and killed 3 children, 2 women and 3 men. Afterwards they claimed the Shasta were preparing for an attack on Americans. This false rumor created a panic among settlers. 28 men gathered to attack the cave. In the skirmish four Americans and one Shasta died. Federal troops from Fort Jones and local volunteers assembled on the Klamath River five miles away from the cave. In total about fifty armed Americans were present. Additional forces from Fort Lane arrived with a howitzer. It was fired at the cave multiple times. Representatives of the headman known to settlers as \\"Bill\\" pressed for peace and of their innocence. Military officials concluded that this was the case. American colonists were held accountable for the outbreak of violence. Smith's decision to cease hostilities with Bill's people was unpopular with local American settlers. He was claimed to have left Americans \\"wholly unprotected from the ruthless and murderous incursions of these savages...\\" In late April 1854 a group of miners found and killed 15 Shasta. These murders were committed in retaliation for some cattle having been stolen. In May 1854 a Shasta man was accused of attempting to rape an American woman. A directive issued from Fort Jones called for the man to be captured and eventually presented to civil authorities in Yreka. Indian agent Rosborough informed representatives of Bill of the military order. The man accused of the rape attempt wasn't from Bill's band. Despite this Bill pushed for a guarantee that the man wouldn't be hanged. Fort Jones command insisted this wasn't possible. The commanding officer declared that if the man wasn't delivered soon all Shasta would be held responsible for his actions. A large party of \\"De Chute\\" natives (likely the Tenino) visiting the area were threatened to be employed in military reprisals against the Shasta. Dignitaries from the Irauitsu expressed support in capturing the man though they also didn't want him to be hung. The accused Shasta was eventually presented to authorities in Yreka. As Fort Jones' commanding officer was absent from the area he was allowed to temporarily depart the town on the condition he remain in the area. A captain was eventually ordered to visit the nearby Shasta settlement where the man was then residing. Headman Bill and several Shasta accompanied the American officer. Upon reaching the village the man was collected. On 24 May while returning to Yreka the Shasta group was attacked on the Klamath River by a group of American settlers and \\"De Chutes\\". The American officer told the Shasta to flee while he attempted to talk the party down. The armed men refused to allow the Shasta to leave peaceably and shot at them. Two Shasta were killed instantly and three seriously injured. Headman Bill was among those wounded and struggled against being scalped by Americans. Eventually they succeeded in removing his scalp and threw him into the Klamath River while he remained alive. Lt. Bonnycastle decried the \\"cowardly and brutal murder\\" committed by the American settlers who apparently escaped unpunished for their actions. On 17 May 1854 some Shasta warriors attacked a mule train in the Siskiyou Mountains. Two Americans were leading the mules. One was killed in the skirmish while the other man escaped to Cottonwood. Five horses and a mule taken by the Shasta. =Rogue River Wars= The Irkirukatsu Shasta joined their Takelma neighbors in militarily resisting American territorial encroachment during the Rogue River Wars. Incoming colonists implemented agricultural operations across the Rogue Valley in 1852 and 1853. Open meadows became plowed and fenced into private farms. Oak forests were timbered for building supplies and additional agricultural land. Livestock such as pigs dug and ate the bulbs and roots to important flowering species.These practices quickly ruined many food sources for the indigenous of the region, including camas, acorns and seeds from a variety of grass species. A group of 150 to 300 Shasta gathered in the upper Rogue River basin in the winter of 1851 to 1852. Reportedly they had congregated to settle a dispute over a woman and were close to finishing negotiations. The American witness to the proceedings considered it largely a \\"war expedition\\". However the peaceable conclusion to the matter through material compensation followed traditional Shasta means of dispute resolution. In early August 1853 a settler named Edwards residing near modern-day Phoenix was found slain in his cabin. Edwards' death incited a harsh response from American settlers. Militias were organized to begin indiscriminately attacking any natives in the Rogue River basin. About a month prior he had visited an Dakubetede settlement in the Applegate Valley and stole a Shasta slave. The abduction was tolerated by Americans and claims for compensation from the former slave owner were ignored. Contemporaries in Jacksonville considered this dispute to the cause of the murder. The Irkirukatsu Shasta were targeted in particular as they were considered particularly unwelcoming and aggressive against American colonists. They received help from some Klamath River Shasta who were expelled from their home territories by miners. Eventually the Shasta and Takelma were pressed into accepting deportation from the Rogue Valley. American officials under Joel Palmer met with the leadership of the Irkirukatsu Shasta, \\"Grave Creek Umpqua\\" and the unrelated Shasta Costa on 18 November 1854. The \\"Chasta Treaty\\" was signed between the groups, although its terms were far from clear to the indigenous leaders. The fifth article stipulated that the Federal government was to fund and staff several facilities on the eventual reservation the Oregon Shasta and their neighbors were to be relocated to. This included a hospital, a schoolhouse, and two blacksmith shops. Reservation life Life on the reservations was a challenging adjustment for the Shasta. The Grand Ronde in November 1856 had an estimated population of 1,025 natives, with 909 either Takelma or Shasta although this perhaps including some Shasta Costa or other natives of Southern Oregon. On 21 September 1857 a federal government official visited the Siletz Reservation. He estimated the Shasta and Takelma to number 544 there.

During his career he worked in various cities including New Orleans, Chicago and New York City. Ellis began his diary in 1927 as a teenager and wrote almost every day for more than 70 years, filling a volume for each year. He was believed to be the most prolific known diarist in the history of American letters; his diary is estimated to total 22 million words.Janny Scott, Edward Robb Ellis Dies at 87; Diarist of 22 Million Words. New York Times, September 9, 1998. He was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the world's longest diary, until the journals of Rev. Robert Shields of Dayton, Washington, crammed with minutiae of daily living to the tune of 37.5 million words, were revealed in 1994.Douglas Martin, Robert Shields, Wordy Diarist, Dies at 89. The New York Times, October 29, 2007. Ellis authored books on the Great Depression and New York City, as well as a study of suicide. According to his book A Diary of the Century, his diaries were bequeathed to the Fales Library at New York University after his death.Fales Library Guide to the Edward Robb Ellis Papers . Biography Edward Robb Ellis was born in 1911 in Kewanee, Illinois, where he grew up. He began writing his diary in 1927 as part of a bet with two other young men as to who could keep up a journal the longest.Judie Glave, \\"No writer's block here: Man has kept a diary for 64 years.\\" Prescott Courier, 1991-09-13. Ellis was determined to be a reporter from an early age. He started out writing feature stories for his hometown's Star Courier newspaper,https://www.starcourier.com/news/20200220/ellis-was-most-prolific- diarist-in-us-history and attended the journalism program at the University of Missouri. In 1934 he took a job as a professional reporter for the New Orleans Associated Press office. In this position he covered the events of the Great Depression and the political career of Huey Long. After two years in New Orleans, he moved to Oklahoma City and became a journalist for the Oklahoma City Times, covering New Deal offices and programs. As part of this position he reported on the Oklahoma Federal Symphony Orchestra, which was funded by the Works Progress Administration. Through this assignment, he met and fell in love with the principal violinist, Leatha Sparlin. They married in 1939 and moved to Peoria, Illinois, where he worked for the Journal-Transcript. The couple then moved to Chicago where he worked for the Daily News. Their daughter, Sandra Gail Ellis, was born on December 28, 1942. Shortly after Sandra's birth, Ellis became aware that a previous diagnosis of a hernia was incorrect. He anticipated being drafted and consequently sought a commission in the navy. He was unable to receive one as he was underweight. As a result, he joined the navy and reported to training on November 7, 1942. With diary keeping prohibited in the armed forces, he changed its format from private entries to letters to his wife and daughter. Ellis detested boot camp, and upon finishing he was appointed editor of the navy hospital newspaper called The Bedside Examiner. He used his position to publish editorials promoting enlisted people's rights as well as critiques of war. After basic training he was stationed in Okinawa where he continued to publish a newspaper, this time explicitly to improve the sailors' morale. Four months later the war ended and he returned to the United States. His wife requested a divorce which he granted the following month; he returned to Chicago to work at the Daily News. Ellis did not fit in under the new management at the newspaper in Chicago and soon left for New York to work at the World Telegram. Ellis loved New York City deeply and would remain there for the rest of his life, eventually meeting and marrying Ruth Kraus with whom he had an exceptionally happy marriage. After 15 years at the World Telegram, Ellis quit after a disagreement with a city editor. He used his time unemployed to write several books, often with Ruth's help. Four of these books were published in his lifetime. Ruth died suddenly of a heart attack in 1965. Ellis went on to have several extended romances, one with June Morgan and another with Selma Pezaro. Although Ellis was not a strong presence in his daughter's childhood, he and Sandy became close in her adulthood, writing numerous letters and challenging each other intellectually. He also forged mentoring relationships with other diarists, usually through interviews and by publishing parts of the diary in A Diary of the Century. Ellis was a contributor to Diarist's Journal, a quarterly newspaper by, for and about diarists, published by Ed Gildea of Lansford, Pennsylvania.Lena Williams, Private Thoughts, Public Revelations, The New York Times, 1993-12-16. His reputation as a diarist led Letts of London to hire him as a consultant, and to create a diary modeled on his recommendations called \\"The Ellis Diary.\\" Ellis' apartment on the third floor on W. 21st St. in Manhattan was filled with words‚Äîboth his own and from other collected books and articles. It was difficult to move about, with books stacked randomly in high piles. Ellis would laugh at his own lack of organizing skills, and was happy to serve guests tea and talk about various subjects. Throughout his career as a reporter, Ellis interviewed numerous celebrities and public figures including Eleanor Roosevelt, Irving Berlin, Grace Kelley and Herbert Hoover. The diary records his impressions of these famous personalities. Ellis was equally fascinated by the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people. He prided himself on his curiosity and eagerness to learn and considered himself what Shakespeare called \\"a snapper- up of unconsidered trifles.\\" The diary is a collection of those trifles and an attempt by its author, as Pete Hamill writes in the introduction to A Diary of the Century, \\"to freeze time\\" and reflect on himself and humanity. Ellis continued to write until his death from emphysema in 1998. Bibliography * Traitor Within: Our Suicide Problem (with George Allen).

Early years Born in La Neuville-aux-Bois in Lorraine, Bernier was orphaned by his father at 11 years and without a proper education, he vacillated between many jobs before fighting in the Indochina Wars for 28 months. On his return he worked in the press, and rose through the ranks to take the position of sales manager of the satirical newspaper Z√©ro. √âditions du Square It was at Z√©ro that he met Fran√ßois Cavanna and Fred, with whom he founded the magazine Hara Kiri in 1960. After an initial ban, production of the magazine moved from Rue Choron to Rue de Montholon and √âditions du Square was created at its publication house. In addition to his role of patron of √âditions du Square, Bernier also invested time in writing and photo-editing for Hara Kiri. It was during this era that he appeared on Jean-Christophe Averty's television variety show Les Raisins verts. In 1969 the Hara Kiri team created Hara-Kiri Hebdo which shortly thereafter was renamed L‚ÄôHebdo Hara-Kiri. Other magazines published by Bernier's Editions du Square were the monthly comic Charlie Mensuel, one of the first ecological journals La Gueule ouverte, Mords-y l'≈ìil, Surprise from designer Bernard Willem Holtrop, and Jean-Patrick Manchette's BD, l'hebdo de la BD. 1970 saw the creation of Charlie Hebdo, a weekly political newspaper for which Bernier was a regular contributor. The publication folded in 1981, but was relaunched by Cavanna and Bernier in 1993 and, as of 2011, remains in publication. Later years In 1988 Bernier adapted his fiches bricolages for television. He also participated in Jean- Michel Ribes' Merci Bernard. His last publications include La Mouise and Grodada, a publication for children. He also participated in several publications affiliated with Hara-Kiri, including ZOO and Yeti, as well as the launching of the periodical Zero in 1986. In 1996, an Aure Atika interview with Jackie Berroyer for Radio Nova degenerated into an angry exchange at table, between fellow guests Choron and Atika, ending with each flinging the contents of their glasses at one another. Personal life Bernier was the father of the comedian Mich√®le Bernier. He died 10 January 2005 at Necker- Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris and was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery alongside his wife Odile Vaudelle (1934‚Äì1985).

They were innovative in their use of a brass section which was atypical for English folk music. The band originally consisted of Martin Carthy (vocals, guitar, mandolin), John Kirkpatrick (vocals, accordion, concertina), Howard Evans (trumpet), Roger Williams (trombone), Martin Brinsford (harmonica, percussion, saxophone). Carthy was a well established musician at their formation, having been a member of Steeleye Span and The Watersons, as well as leading a successful solo career. Kirkpatrick had also played with Steeleye Span for a time, and worked with Carthy in the Albion Country Band. The two formed an occasional trio with Evans after all three appeared on Carthy's albums Because It's There (1979) and Out of the Cut (1982). Brass Monkey was formed with the addition of Williams and Brinsford after initially being billed as The Martin Carthy Band. In 1984, after recording their first album, Williams was replaced by Richard Cheetham (born 29 January 1957, in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire). The band recorded the two albums Brass Monkey (1983) and See How it Runs (1986). Both primarily consisted of traditional songs and tunes and were later re-issued on a single CD under the title The Complete Brass Monkey (1993). They also guested on Loudon Wainwright III's 1986 album More Love Songs. Unable to reconcile the schedules of its various members, the band reluctantly broke up in 1987. In 1997, the group reunited for a tour, and soon recorded a third album, Sound and Rumour. This was followed by Going and Staying in 2001 on which both Williams and Cheetham appeared and Flame of Fire in 2004, which reverted to the original line-up. Despite Evans' death, in 2006 the band decided to continue, initially with a four-piece line-up who debuted with a short set at a Watersons family show at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 May 2007 before a short UK tour later in the same year and sporadic live shows during 2008. Later in 2008, the band recruited Paul Archibald to as their new trumpet player and debuted their new lineup at the Electric Theatre in Guildford on 15 March 2009. This line-up released a new CD Head of Steam on 20 April 2009.

Wauchope is a town in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. It is within the boundaries of the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council area. Wauchope is inland on the Hastings River and the Oxley Highway west of Port Macquarie. The town is north of the state capital Sydney. Wauchope is the location of Timbertown, a popular heritage theme park inspired by the logging industry that formed the basis for Wauchope's early economy and prosperity. The town has a population of approximately 7,500 (as of 2006 - including King Creek & Redbank). It has also played an important role in the Hastings Valley dairy industry. History The Birpai (also known as Birrbay) people have lived in this area for more than 40,000 years. By 1828 a number of land grants had been made along the Hastings River. It was not until 1836 that the village of Wauchope first came into existence. In that year Captain Robert Andrew Wauch (whose father dropped the 'ope' from the end of his name as a result of a family dispute) paid a deposit on on King Creek. He bought more property and built Wauch House. Robert Wauch died in the Macleay area in 1866, and the Government Gazette published the deeds of his properties, specifying that they should be called Wauchope. When the post office opened in a nearby settlement in 1881, it was named Wauchope, although the Government Gazette misprinted the name Wanghope, an error that was not corrected until 1889. It is pronounced 'war-hope', although the family pronounced their name 'walk-op'.1949 'Pronunciation of Wauchope', The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), 25 April, p. 2. , viewed 18 Feb 2018, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18112628 This is similar to the Canadian town which is pronounced 'walk-up'. Floods The largest recorded flood in the Hastings River at Wauchope occurred on 13 January 1968 and reached a peak level of above the Australian height datum (m AHD). The 1968 flood was estimated to be slightly rarer than a 100-year event. The next largest flood was determined to be the flood of 5 to 7 March 1894. This flood reached a peak flood level of 8.9 m AHD at Wauchope. Other major floods occurred at Wauchope in February 1950 (8.45 m AHD), February 1929 (8.3 m AHD), August 1864 (8.2 m AHD), and June 1950 (8.1 m AHD). The 1963 flood, which is notorious for the damage it caused in the lower reaches of the river, is only ranked as the eighth highest flood at Wauchope. It reached a peak level at Wauchope of 7.75 m AHD and was considered to be a 1 in 15-year event at Wauchope. On 23 February 2013 floodwaters peaked at 7.22 m AHD at 7.30pm after heavy rainfall in the upper catchment area. Industry and economy Wauchope's economy was traditionally based on the timber industry. At different stages in its history, more timber was transported out of Wauchope than out of any other town in Australia (via Wauchope railway station). Timber from Wauchope was used in the construction of the Sydney Opera House. Industry in and around Wauchope has transformed primarily into farming and tourism. Increasingly, Wauchope and its surrounding villages and farms are becoming known for gourmet produce, including cheeses, wines and organic fruits and vegetables. The Hastings Farmers Markets are held at the Wauchope Showground on the 4th Saturday of every month and showcase a wide variety of local produce. Timbertown, the town's best-known tourist attraction, is a colonial- era themed village, which is located on the outskirts of Wauchope. It features static displays and attractions such as a working steam train, bullock team, and a Cobb and Co stage coach. The Big Bull was a notable tourist attraction between Wauchope and Port Macquarie for twenty years, but was removed in 2007. Other important attractions include the historical society, historic buildings, Broken Bago vineyards and natural attractions including state forests and Bago Bluff National Park. Wauchope railway station serves as an interchange for passengers travelling to nearby coastal centres such as Port Macquarie. Layout The township is set out along the southern bank of the Hastings River with the back drop of Bago Mountain further south. The main street is High Street (a small section of the Oxley Highway), running generally westward through the town after coming east from Port Macquarie and across the North Coast railway line. The main street includes the Co-op general store (previously Parkers) and a number of smaller businesses and local bank branches. At the corner of Hastings Street is the local post office. Further up the main street is the town clock, a legacy of the days the town was the centre of the Hastings Shire local government area. Back along Hastings Street is the Co-op supermarket as well as the court house. In 2009 work commenced on the rebuilding of this supermarket. The old building was completely demolished and a much larger and more modern structure was completed and opened in 2010. The main cross street is Cameron Street. The Hastings Hotel is on the south-east corner of Cameron and High and the Star Hotel is a short distance north. The RSL club is another north. Cameron Street leads to the Hastings River. A wharf was built at the northern end of Cameron Street for shipping produce downstream to Port Macquarie, but this no longer exists. To the south of the main shopping area is the Wauchope Golf Course and Country Club, which occupies a premium site within the middle of the town. Further west is Timbertown, on the edge of large tracts of forestry land leading into the Bago Mountain area. To the east of the main shopping area is the railway line from Sydney. The Hastings dairy and milk factory is located close to the point where the railway line crosses the Hastings River. Schools * Wauchope Public School * St Joseph's Primary School * Wauchope High School Wauchope has its own railway station on the North Coast Line of New South Wales. It is serviced by six NSW TrainLink trains per day 3 heading South (to Sydney), 3 heading further north to Grafton, Casino, and Brisbane. Passengers can alight at this station for connecting coaches to the nearby Port Macquarie.

Origins  The Vikings, previously known as the Norse Film and Pageant Society (NFPS), which was founded in 1971 by Peter Seymour and Alan Jeffery, initially as an extension to their 'Central Focus' WWII film club, with the purpose of bringing an awareness of the Norse Myths and the Viking culture to the public through dramatic entertainment. They are the oldest and largest Dark Ages society in the UK.BBC News: \\"Normans fight Saxons... and the rain\\". \\"Most of the re-enactment participants are part of Britain's largest Dark Age re- enactment society, The Vikings.\\"King Harold and William Square Up, BBC News, October 14, 2006 They are a founding member of the National Association of Re- enactment Societies. In its N.F.P.S days, the society consisted of some thirty core members, including the 'Odin Guard' an elite combat group maintaining Norse Heathen religious practices and values, but which eventually left the society during the leadership of Gerry East, whose recruitment tactics eventually took the membership into the three hundred plus bracket. The Society now has over 1100 members throughout Britain, Europe and North America. While the Society concentrates mainly on the 10th Century, events are often set in the wider period from 790 to 1066, with the appropriate modifications to dress and equipment used. Despite the 'Vikings!' title of the Society, the groups within it portray Saxon,Richards. \\"Members of a group called The Vikings...posing as Saxons were raising money for the British Heart Foundation.\\" Norman, Celtic, and Viking cultures.  Objectives  The Vikings' goal is to provide an accurate and educational portrayal of the Viking period, with equal emphasis on the daily life of the period and on the more warlike aspects of life in what was a formative period in European history. Events staged by The Vikings aim for a high standard of presentation, historical accuracy and attention to detail. For combat displays, which combine public entertainment with a historical background, the battle organisers strive to recreate an event local to the area. Aside from the combat, at each event there are extensive living history displays which present a cross-section of life in the tenth century.  Local Groups  The Vikings has local groups in the UK, mainland Europe and Northern America, each group usually numbers between 5 and 50 members depending on the region. The groups are each led by a Sturaesman (or woman) or Jarl, who deals with the administrative and organisational aspects, and when at large events each will usually fight as one unit.  Educational Visits  Aside from the main events, in many regions of the UK the society offers school visits by experienced and knowledgeable personnel in full period dress and equipment. These visits include a variety of activities based around the UK National Curriculum framework of Key Stage Two's ‚ÄúInvaders and Settlers‚Äù topic. The Society also provides resources for schools, including a teacher's resource book for KS2. In some cases, clothing and equipment can be loaned to schools for short periods to assist in classroom work. All visitors hold either a CRB disclosure to a minimum of standard level, or one from Disclosure Scotland.  Membership  Full membership of The Vikings is open to anyone over the age of 18. In the UK, children aged 16 and 17 are allowed to train and participate in the combat displays when accompanied by an adult. Due to safety regulations, children under 16 years old may not take part in combat displays, although correctly dressed and equipped 13-15 year olds are used as battlefield runners and/or waterbearers.

Cremorne is located 6 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of North Sydney Council. Cremorne Point shares the postcode of 2090 with Cremorne, a separate suburb to the north. Cremorne Point sits on Sydney Harbour between Shell Cove and Mosman Bay. Cremorne Junction is a locality within the suburb of Cremorne. Etymology Cremorne was named after the Cremorne Gardens in London, a popular pleasure ground in England, which derives from Gaelic words meaning 'boundary' and 'chieftain'. Robertsons Point was named after James Robertson who was granted 35 hectares there in 1820. He was the father of Premier Sir John Robertson. History Wooloorigang / Cremorne Point and Mosman Bay were both once Cammeraygal territory named Wul-warra-Jeung before European settlement in Sydney Cove to their south. Aborigines called the waters east of the point Goram-Bullagong. In early European settlement after 1788, it became known as Careening Point and Mosman Cove became known as Hungry Bay. Careening Point commemorates HMS Sirius, a ship from the First Fleet of 1788, which was refurbished, pushed upstream in Mosman Bay. =Nineteenth century= In January 1822 Scot James Robertson, a watch maker, arrived on the Providence with wife and six children to become Supervisor of Governor Brisbane's astronomical instruments and clocks at his observatory in the Parramatta Domain. Brisbane was named \\"founder\\" of Australian science by Sir William Herschel, himself a noted astronomer and botanist who spent some time in South Africa. Robertson was granted a large amount of land on the Upper Hunter River and later in 1823 a further of Cremorne headland, where he built a Georgian house with fine cedar joinery. In its grounds were some fine pear trees. One of his sons became Sir John Robertson, NSW's fifth Premier - and premier five times. James Milson Jnr (1814-1903), son of James Milson (1785-1872) who had owned much land in nearby Milsons Point, was a merchant and a pastoralist in NSW and Queensland. He expanded the family's land holdings in the lower North Shore, including the 1853 purchase of the Cremorne peninsula. The sale of this land for residential blocks in the last years of the 19th and early years of the 20th centuries proved to be especially profitable. Much to Milson's disgust, the courts prevented him from selling building blocks running right to the water's edge and Cremorne is consequently one of the few Sydney Harbour peninsulas with a public, waterfront park running around its edges. The last of the family's holdings in the lower North Shore area were resumed in the early 1920s for the construction of the Harbour Bridge and associated roadways.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 174 The Rev. W. B. Clarke identified a coal seam running under much of Sydney and proposed it be mined. An experimental copper smelting industry was established in the mid-1840s on the eastern shore but was not successful and was removed by 1849. In 1853 North Shore pioneer James Milson bought the land - Robertson's house became the Cremorne Hotel, later Cremorne House - and three years later leased to J. R. Clarke and Charles H. Woolcott, who planned Cremorne Gardens, named for the rather notorious Regency Pleasure Gardens in London. These opened in 1856 with and amusements galore. Steamers plied from Circular Quay and Woolloomooloo Bay every half hour until late. There were scenic walks - the Serpentine Walk and Italian Walk. Papers advertised \\"a monster dancing stage, in circumference', an \\"excellent (German) band, carousel, archery, quoits, rifle shooting, skittles, gymnastics, rifle gallery and refreshments\\" at Sydney prices. Even a masked ball. At 8pm, magnificent fireworks, a la Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens (London) and splendid pyrotechny as in Cremorne Gardens, London. The Sydney Morning Herald declared Cremorne to \\"be ranked among the best of those places of holiday resort of a superior order which have recently sprung into existence in the neighbourhood of Sydney\\". Anyone missing the last boat was compelled to remain behind overnight, as the bush was too thick to penetrate and few cared to swim back. By 1862 the place had an unsavoury reputation and the \\"Gardens\\" were in ruins. Around 1875 a white cask was moored just off Cremorne Point and used for target practice from Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Balls from the cannon would skim across the harbour ending up near Whiting Beach, near Taronga Zoo. The barrage would stop for the hourly steam ferry. In the 1880s and 1890s Cremorne Point was a more genteel Victorian Sunday destination. In 1891 and 1893 Sydney Harbour Collieries Ltd. sank exploratory bores and discovered coal ten feet thick. Despite support from the Mines Department, the Lands Department refused permission to build coal wharves and the company found an alternative base in Balmain. =Twentieth century= In 1905 a Harbour Foreshores Vigilance Committee formed and Cremorne Reserve was proclaimed later that year, with North Sydney Council as trustee. This was the culmination of a ten-year campaign to secure the area as public land. It reflected other campaigns for harbour foreshore reserves and conservation of that time. Magnificent harbour and city views were and remain available from here. The McCallum Pool west of Cremorne Point was built in the 1920s as a pleasure pool for residents. As the threat of industrialisation subsided, others arose. Subdivision of the peninsula followed land reservation. By 1925 residential development encroached. While private gardens flourished, weeds and rubbish choked the foreshore reserve. Reports that \\"respectable people\\" didn't go there at night suggest it was sheltering the homeless or carousing couples after dark. North Sydney Council started a beautification campaign in the 1920s with local residents helping, transforming it by the 1930s. Several elements of that era survive - a concrete and chicken wire sign, archway etc. Then, perhaps due to the 1930s depression and World War II, it sank into neglect again. The area attracted various architects including J. Burcham Clamp: his house The Laurels (1907, extended 1920) is a striking Arts & Crafts example. A 1927 issue of The Home magazine featured an Italian (Mediterranean revival) example - a house belonging to Mr F. C. Lane.Read, 2008 =Transport= K-class ferry Initially, access across the harbour was largely by being rowed by a privately hired watermen. Cremorne Point was included as a stop by privately operated ferry services to Mosman in the 1850s, however, these were discontinued due to lack of local residents. Old Cremorne Wharf on the east side of the point was included in regular services to Mosman and Neutral Bay that recommenced in 1872. Sydney Ferries Limited built a new wharf at Robertson Point in 1911 and added ferry services from Circular Quay on 18 December 1911 to meet a new tram service that also commenced that year. The Edwardian style wharf building burnt down in 1975. The foreshore path from Neutral Bay to Cremorne Point wharf dates to 1830 when the reserve was retained by the Crown. Cremorne Point Reserve is the most substantial example in North Sydney of imposition of the (Harbour Foreshore) Reservation, applied from 1828. Demographics According to the 2016 census , there were 2,409 residents in Cremorne Point. * 58.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 8.6%. 79.8% of people spoke only English at home. * The residents were somewhat older than the norm for Australia; their median age was 43 years, compared to the national median of 38 years.

A member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Sibylla became a Swedish princess by marrying Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V√§sterbotten, who did not live to ascend the Swedish throne. Early life Sibylla and brother Hubertus 1917 Sibylla (then Sibylle) was born at Schloss Friedenstein on 18 January 1908 as the elder daughter and second child of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein, a daughter of Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig- Holstein, and descended from an older Scandinavian royal house. Through her father, she was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Her paternal grandfather was Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Marriage In November 1931, Sibylla was in London to attend the wedding of her paternal first cousin Lady May Abel Smith as a bridesmaid. One of the other bridesmaids was her second cousin Princess Ingrid of Sweden, who introduced Sibylla to her brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V√§sterbotten. Their engagement was announced at Callenberg Castle in Coburg 16 June 1932. Wedding of Princess Sibylla and Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden in Coburg in 1932. On 19 October in Coburg, Sibylla married her second cousin Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of V√§sterbotten, in a civil ceremony, followed by a church wedding the day after. Gustaf Adolf was the eldest son of Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden (later Gustaf VI Adolf) and Princess Margaret of Connaught, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Both Sibylla and Gustaf Adolf were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria. Sibylla never became Crown Princess herself since her husband died before his father and his grandfather King Gustav V. The wedding was celebrated in an official manner in Coburg, as President Hindenburg had ordered that no honours should be spared.Lars Elgklou (Swedish): Bernadotte.

However, as the city of Coburg was dominated by the Nazi party at the time, the celebrations there were Nazi influenced, which made a very bad impression in Sweden. The ceremony took place at St. Moriz. The couple spent their honeymoon in Italy before arriving in Stockholm on 25 November 1932. The couple had five children: *Princess Margaretha (born 31 October 1934) married John Ambler on 30 June 1964 and is his widow. They had three children. *Princess Birgitta (born 19 January 1937) married Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern on 25 May 1961 and is his widow.

Princess of Sweden The couple settled at Haga Palace, and their four daughters were to be commonly known during their childhood as the \\"Hagaprinsessorna\\" (English: \\"The Haga Princesses\\"). Sibylla shared her husband's enthusiasm for sport and outdoor activities, and the couple owned a cottage in Ingar√∂ and another one in Storlien. Sibylla was also a keen supporter of the Swedish Girl Guides movement. During her lifetime, she was appointed chairman of various organisations such as S√§llskapet Barnav√•rd (English: \\"The Childcare Society\\") in 1948 and the honorary chairmanship of the H√∂rselfr√§mjandet (English: \\"The Hearing Society\\") in 1935; the Sveriges flickscoutr√•d (English: \\"The Swedish Girls Scouts\\") in 1939; Kvinnliga bilk√•ren (English: \\"The Women's Automobile Force\\") in 1939; the Stiftelsen Solstickan (English: \\"The Solstickan Society\\") in 1941; and the Stiftelsen Drottning Victorias Vilohem p√• √ñland (English: \\"The Queen Victoria Resting Home in √ñland\\") in 1951. In 1938, she founded the Prinsessan Sibyllas S:t Martin-stiftelse (English: \\"The Princess Sibylla Foundation of St Martin\\"). Widowhood Solna, Sweden Sibylla became a widow in 1947 when Gustaf Adolf died in an airplane crash at the Copenhagen Airport in Denmark. Their only son, Carl Gustaf, became second-in-line to the throne at the age of nine months and, later, Crown Prince at the age of four. In 1950, Sibylla moved from Haga to the Royal Palace of Stockholm. During the summers, she stayed at Solliden. During these years, she developed an interest in environmental issues. After her stepmother-in-law, Queen Louise, died in 1965, Princess Sibylla became the highest ranking woman in the royal family. She took over her duties in support of her father-in-law, King Gustaf VI Adolf. During these years, she enjoyed somewhat more popularity, as she was more exposed, and as her humour and sense of self-irony became more known and appreciated. She continued with the so-called \\"Democratic ladies lunches\\" for career women initiated by Queen Louise in 1962 as a replacement for the court presentation. Sibylla died in Stockholm of cancer less than a year before her son ascended to the throne.

Ghost nets are fishing nets that have been left or lost in the ocean by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can entangle fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver.Esteban, Michelle (2002) Tracking Down Ghost Nets Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe. Description Many marine species including turtles, sharks, whales, dolphins, dugongs become entangled in ghost nets. Most go unnoticed and unrecorded. A glass float on the beach. Many of these floats for fish nets wash up on island beaches around the Pacific. The loss of the floats can leave fish nets drifting in the open ocean where they continue to entangle fish, birds, and marine mammals. Some commercial fisherman use gillnets. These are suspended in the sea by flotation buoys, such as glass floats, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. If this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time. The problem is not just nets but ghost gear in general;Hannah Gould, Hidden problem of 'ghost gear': the abandoned fishing nets clogging up oceans, Theguardian.com, 10 September 2015 old-fashioned crab traps, without the required \\"rot-out panel\\", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up fishing line can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.Dunagan, Christopher (2000)The Sun. The net effect: trouble , 5 April Fishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them. The French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.Andres, Von Brandt (1984) Fish catching methods of the world . In September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the World Animal Protection to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause. The term ALDFG means \\"abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear\\". Environmental impact From 2000 to 2012, the National Marine Fisheries Service reported an average of 11 large whales entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in Washington (state) with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% (640,000 tonnes) of all marine litter. An estimated 46% of the Great Pacific garbage patch consists of fishing related plastics. According to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of Dungeness crab over 10 years. The Virginia Institute of Marine Science calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million blue crabs each year in the Chesapeake Bay alone. In May 2016, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and Torres Strait protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.Ghost net busters, Afma.gov.au, 3 May 2016 Solutions= Alternative materials and practice = Unlike synthetic fishing nets, biodegradable fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time.

Gofio has been an important ingredient in Canarian cooking for some time, and Canarian emigrants have spread its use to the Caribbean (notably in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela) and the Western Sahara. It is also found in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, where it is known as harina tostada and is employed in a wide variety of recipes. The gofio commercially available in the Canary Islands is always finely ground, like ordinary flour, despite the definition given in the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy. Gofio is thought to have been the main staple of the diet of the Guanches, the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands, who produced it from barley\\"Historia de la conquista de las siete islas de Canaria\\", Fr. J. de Abreu Galindo, Editorial Goya, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, 1977 and the rhizome of certain ferns. The latter is also known to have been used in historical times, especially in famine, even up until the 20th century.El bosque de laurisilva en la econom√≠a guanche, Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Morales, Aula de Cultura de Tenerife, del Excmo. Cabildo Insular de Tenerife, 1989 Gofio derives from the name for the product in the aboriginal language of Gran Canaria, while in neighbouring Tenerife it was known as ahoren. Among the Berbers of North Africa, from whom the Guanche population largely derived, there existed a toasted barley flour with similar usage as a food, called arkul. In Morocco, toasted flour is also mixed with, among other ingredients, almond paste, honey, argan oil, anise, fennel, and sesame seeds to make \\"sellou\\" (also called \\"zamita\\" or \\"slilou\\" in some regions), a sweet paste known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value. It was amongst the provisions of the crew of Thor Heyerdahl's \\"Ra II\\" expedition to cross the Atlantic aboard a papyrus ship using the Canary Current in 1970. Flours made from toasted grains are also known in other gastronomies worldwide, notably Tibetan tsampa. Roasting the grain before milling has the advantage of destroying mold and mold toxins, allowing poorly stored grain to be used, as well as improving flavour by producing more complex sugars. The traditional roasting process, at temperatures typically much higher than those used for malt barley in the brewing industry, for example, also has the effect of partly breaking down the starch and proteins, making them more digestible. Gofio with milk, sugar and water is a very popular beverage in Western Sahara, due to Spanish influence and the proximity of the Canary Islands. Gofio in the Canary Islands is currently produced from cereals of several types, as well as pulses. Maize and wheat are the most common cereals used, but various mixes of these with rye, barley, etc., are also readily available in shops. Gofios of chickpeas and lupin beans are also produced in Fuerteventura, as well as from other wild plants occurring there. Uses in Canarian foods Gofio is a highly versatile product which can be added to soups, stews, desserts, ice cream, sauces, and more. It is very rich in vitamins, proteins, fibre, and minerals. It was favoured by Canarian mariners as it can be stored for long periods while retaining its goodness. It was a vitally important part of the Canarian diet during the lean years after the Spanish Civil War. Mixed with a little water and sugar and kneaded (traditionally inside a goatskin bag) it produces a dough-like mixture that can be eaten as it is and was traditionally used in this way by peasant workers in the fields. Perhaps the most common use today is to add to a small amount to milk, to produce a wholesome and convenient breakfast food, or to thicken soups or stews at the table. Another popular form is gofio escaldado (\\"scalded gofio\\") or escald√≥n, a kind of thick porridge made by mixing it with the stock from a stew or soup, which is then served alongside the same. Modern products incorporating gofio include ice cream, mousses, other milk desserts and even a beer, Volcan, which was marketed for only a short time around the year 2000. Uses elsewhere In the Caribbean, gofio is a snack eaten as it is. In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, gofio is sold with sugar added, as a candy, sometimes served in a paper cone. Aboriginals of Argentina and Chile have used a preparation of maize made by the same method of making gofio since before the arrival of the Spaniards. The preparation of gofio in other regions of South America and the Caribbean has come due to Canarian arrival. Gofio is consumed dry with sugar or with milk in Argentina, Chile, Panama, Venezuela, Uruguay and many other countries.

The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1936 to 1939. The station then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. A camping coach was positioned here by the Southern Region from 1954 to 1960, the coach was replaced in 1961 by a Pullman camping coach until 1965 which was joined by another Pullman for 1966 and 1967. The station was renamed Ashurst (New Forest) on 24 September 1995. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways. Services The station is some 200 to 300 yards from the village of Ashurst, and is used by visitors to the New Forest. It is served hourly by the London Waterloo to stopping services operated by South Western Railway, with some additional fast trains to London Waterloo and to at weekday peak periods. The services are formed of Class 444 electric multiple units, and Class 450 units. Services were previously operated by Class 442 Wessex Electrics, which were withdrawn at the start of February 2007.

It stars Wario, a treasure hunter who must find treasure and fight enemies to progress. Wario can jump and charge with his shoulder as basic techniques, though he can also equip special hats to gain things such as fire breathing and bull horns. He has the ability to enter the background at certain points, a gimmick which works with the game's 3D gimmick. It was developed by Nintendo R&D1;, containing a large portion of its staff, and features the red-and-black color scheme that is standard for Virtual Boy releases. It received generally positive reception, particularly among retrospectives. It is regarded as the best game on the Virtual Boy, with some critics wanting to see it re-released for other systems to allow more people to play. It served as an inspiration for multiple games due to its background gimmick, including Donkey Kong Country Returns and Mutant Mudds. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Virtual Boy Wario Land stars Wario on a quest to find treasure in the Awazon. Gameplay involves techniques such as jumping, charging, and throwing enemies and objects. The levels he explores are viewed from a sidescrolling perspective. He has the ability to jump into the background at special blocks. Similarly to Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, featuring the ability to equip hats to gain new powers, which he loses if he takes damage or dies. These hats include an eagle hat that allows Wario to charge horizontally in mid-air, a dragon hat that breathes fire, and a bull hat that increases his power and adds horns. He can obtain a hat with all three abilities called the King Dragon Hat. In each stage, Wario must collect treasure and find a key to unlock the elevator to the next stage. Players can find different treasures hidden around the stages to increase their overall score. There are also mini-games in between stages in which Wario can gamble with the loot he has collected so far. Players fight bosses on occasion, which make use of the game's background gimmick.  Development and release  Virtual Boy Wario Land was developed by Nintendo R&D1; and published by Nintendo. The game was originally named Wario Cruise, appearing with the name on the Virtual Boy system's box and in a Nintendo Power issue. Its development had a large allocation of R&D1;'s staff involved. The music and sound effects were composed by Kazumi Totaka, who ended his work with R&D1; with it. Totaka includes a song called \\"Totaka's Song\\", which he hides in most video games he composes. Like all other Virtual Boy games, Virtual Boy Wario Land uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick used to simulate 3D. It was released on November 27, 1995 in North America and December 1, 1995 in Japan.  Reception and legacy  Virtual Boy Wario Land garnered mixed reviews upon release. Los Angeles Timess Aaron Curtis found the game enjoyable, but did not like the Virtual Boy's visual style. Rocky Mountain Newss Joel Easley felt that its use of 3D demonstrated the Virtual Boy's possibilities. GamePros Wes Nihei praised it for its sound effects and character sprite quality, calling it the best of the platform. Next Generation felt that while it had appeal to more \\"hardcore\\" Mario fans, it was not very advanced in comparison to older Mario games, particularly noting that the 3D mechanics did not affect gameplay much. AllGames Scott Alan Marriott felt that it was a good demonstration of the Virtual Boy's gimmicks and enjoyed its gameplay. Nintendo World Reports Neal Ronaghan enjoyed the background gimmick but felt it did not do as well as it could to explore the concept. Retrospective criticism for Virtual Boy Wario Land has been more favorable. Plays Dave Halverson returned to play Virtual Boy Wario Land often, praising it for not getting tiresome to play. It has been named as one of the best games on the Virtual Boy by GamesRadar+, Nintendo Power and Retronauts, the latter which noted that it should be remade for a different platform. Retro Gamer felt that the background gimmick helped enhance an otherwise \\"traditional\\" platformer. ABC's Good Game also felt that it could have done more with its visuals, nonetheless calling it the best Virtual Boy game. Destructoid and IGN hoped that it would be re-released on the Nintendo 3DS, while Kotaku felt that it was unappreciated back when it was released due to its platform. 1UP.coms Neal Ronaghan felt that it served as a demonstration of what a \\"traditional\\" game could look like with the 3D gimmicks. GameZone felt that its cavernous setting helped the Virtual Boy emphasize subtle visual details, considering it worth buying a Virtual Boy for this game. Virtual Boy Wario Lands background gimmick served as inspiration for multiple developers, including Retro Studios in the 2010 Wii game Donkey Kong Country Returns and Jool Watsham in the 2011 3DS game Mutant Mudds.

Course and features Hastings River rises in the Great Dividing Range, southwest of Kemps Pinnacle, in the area surrounding Oxley Wild Rivers National Park and Werrikimbe National Park and flows generally south, southeast and east, joined by seven tributaries including the Tobins, Forbes, Ellenborough, Pappinbarra and Thone rivers, before reaching its mouth, flowing into the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, at Port Macquarie. The river descends over its course. The course of the river flows adjacent to the settlements Ellenborough, Long Flat, Beechwood, Wauchope and Port Macquarie. The Oxley Highway is generally aligned with the middle and lower reaches of the river. West of Port Macquarie, the Pacific Highway crosses the Hastings River. History The Hastings River has been inhabited by Birpai Aboriginal people for thousands of years, who knew it as Doongang. The river was first charted by European explorers in 1818, after being sighted by John Oxley. He named the river the Hastings River for the then Governor-General of India, Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings. On 19 November 2002, two anglers found the dismembered body of murdered Sydney drug dealer, Terry Falconer. Investigations revealed that Falconer had died three days beforehand, after his corpse had been cut up and dumped in the Hastings River by Anthony Perish and his criminal gang associates. Recreation, flora and fauna The Hastings River gives its name to the Hastings River wine region and to an endangered species of mammal, the Hastings River Mouse (Pseudomys oralis).

Reenactors at Signal Hill, St. John's in British uniform from 1795 Modern reenactment is historical reenactment of events of the modern period, most commonly events from the 18th century to the present. The period starts with events such as the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the peak of the Royal Navy's power. The Victorian era is included, although not as well covered in terms of events as the major battles before and after it, with the notable exception of the American Civil War, which has a large and active community of reenactors. Depictions of 20th century events such as World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War are more firmly classified as modern reenactment. The period includes the development of firearms, from musket and cannon to automatic weapons, and vehicles (jeeps and army trucks are popular).

Shortly after the murder, Streleski turned himself in to the authorities, claiming he felt the murder was justifiable homicide because de Leeuw had withheld departmental awards from him, demeaned Streleski in front of his peers, and refused his requests for financial support.Schmidt, Jeff. Disciplined Minds. Rowman and Littlefield, 2000. Pages 259-260. Streleski was in his 19th year pursuing his doctorate in the mathematics department, alternating with low-paying jobs to support himself. During his trial Streleski told the court he felt the murder was \\"logically and morally correct\\" and \\"a political statement\\" about the department's treatment of its graduate students, and he forced his court-appointed lawyer to enter a plea of \\"not guilty\\" rather than \\"not guilty by reason of insanity\\" as the lawyer had urged. Streleski was convicted of second degree murder and he served seven years in prison for his actions. Streleski was eligible for parole on three occasions, but turned it down as the conditions of his parole required him to not set foot on the Stanford campus. Upon his release in 1985, he said, \\"I have no intention of killing again. On the other hand, I cannot predict the future.\\" In 1993 Streleski was turned down for a fare box repair position with the San Francisco Municipal Railway after his crime came to light.Staff report (May 4, 1993).

Patitz is one of the \\"big five\\" supermodels who appeared in the 1990 music video \\"Freedom! '90\\" by George Michael, and is associated with the editorial, advertising, and fine-art works of photographers Herb Ritts and Peter Lindbergh. In his 2015 book Models of Influence: 50 Women Who Reset The Course of Fashion, Nigel Barker reflected on Patitz's modeling career during the height of the supermodel era in the 1980s and 1990s, writing that Patitz possessed an exoticism and broad emotional range that set her apart from her peers. In her 2012 memoir, creative director of Vogue Grace Coddington regarded Patitz as one of the original supermodels and a must in photographs and on the catwalk. Harper's Bazaar wrote, \\"Indeed, Patitz's features almost confuse. Like Garbo or the Mona Lisa, the inexplicable gifts of line and luminescence defy definition.\\" Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour stated that Patitz had always been one of her favorite models. Patitz's work bridged the eras of the exhibitionist 1980s and the minimalist 1990s in an enduring way, as Barker concluded, \\"The most lasting images of her are when she was really looking like herself.\\" Today, Patitz is an avid horsewoman who continues her lifelong passion for animals and the environment by campaigning for ecological causes and animal rights. Her self-described eclectic and bohemian design aesthetic for residential architecture and home design in her adoptive home state of California has been recognized internationally. Early life Patitz was born in Hamburg, GermanyTatjana Patitz at Fashion Model Directory. accessed 2008-09-14. and raised in Skan√∂r, Sweden. She learned to ride horses at the age of seven. During the summers, she found respite at her family's summer vacation home in Mallorca, where she participated in horse camps. Career=Modelling 1980s = In 1983 at the age of 17, Patitz entered and became a finalist in the Elite Model Look (formerly known as Elite Models' \\"Look of the Year\\" contest), and based on a Polaroid, she was placed third by Elite Model Management founder John Casablancas. Patitz won a contract and moved to Paris to begin working as a model. Though not an immediate success, by 1985, Patitz worked regularly and at the end of that year, she modelled for the cover of British Vogue, her first major cover. That year she began to work with photographer Peter Lindbergh with whom she cultivated a 30-year collaborative relationship which contributed to the launch of the supermodel era. In his book, 10 Women, Lindbergh wrote, \\"I admire Tatjana because she always stays herself. She's very soft, but at the same time she's very strong and knows how to stand up for what she thinks, and it's always very enriching to be with her. It's impossible not to admire her and over the years not to be just a little bit in love with her. Patitz's work in Europe led her to New York where she worked for Vogue and such photographers as Irving Penn, Helmut Newton, Steven Meisel, Denis Piel, Sheila Metzner, and Wayne Maser. She also worked with Gilles Bensimon at Elle and Francesco Scavullo at Cosmopolitan. The December 1985 issue of Vogue featured Irving Penn's photograph, \\"Colored Contact Lenses\\", showing Patitz wearing contact lenses over closed eyelids. The image would later be featured in the 1992 book \\"On The Edge: Images from 100 Years of Vogue\\" as one of the iconic photographs of the era. In 1986, she appeared on two covers of the Italian edition of Vogue and continued to be featured in editorials in the American and British editions of Vogue. Patitz appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein photographed by Bruce Weber, and in 1987 for Revlon's \\"The Most Unforgettable Women in the World\\" campaign photographed by Richard Avedon. Avedon also photographed Patitz for her first cover of American Vogue (May 1987), which is regarded as one of the definitive covers of the 1980s. Vogue began regularly including Patitz's name on the pages of fashion editorials as early as 1987, familiarizing readers not only with her face, but also with her personality. During this period, Patitz met Los Angeles-based photographer Herb Ritts, with whom she shared another significant and enduring collaboration in fashion, fine art, and commercial work, like a muse playing any role he suggested - mermaid, sprite, surfer girl, plainswoman, movie star. Ritts said of Patitz, \\"Her features are a bit off; she's not a typical, commercial beauty, but when I shoot her, I'm never bored. Her looks have power, strength, intensity.\\" Patitz was the subject of his work Tatjana Veiled Head (Tight View), Joshua Tree 1988. As the decade progressed, Patitz's career escalated and she was credited with expanding ideals of female beauty. Patitz and a select group of individual-looking, business-minded, high-profile fashion models emerged and came to be known as the original supermodels. A photograph showing Patitz with them laughing on the beach was taken by Peter Lindbergh for Vogue during this period. Simply titled \\"White Cotton Shirts\\", the image, now regarded as an iconic fashion photograph, was accompanied by an article that singled out Patitz for her \\"astonishing presence\\", praising her \\"uncosmeticised womanliness, new and important in the 1980s.\\" In another 1988 Vogue article titled \\"Tatjana: Million Dollar Beauty\\", Patitz's creative team shared their impressions of her: \\"In pictures, her sensitivity is what comes through; something delicate, fragile, exciting. It's a strange mixture of lazy sensuality and moments of intense emotion,\\" said John Casablancas, president of Elite Model Management. \\"It's hard to get a bad picture of Tatjana. She's very photogenic, which is very rare, and she looks different in every light,\\" added photographer Patrick Demarchelier. \\"While some models develop one look, she has many.\\" Her versatility was exemplified by the changing of her hair color and style with each passing year during the late 1980s, from short- haired brunette to tawny mane to long and blond. For an April 1989 editorial titled \\"Earthly Powers\\" in British Vogue, hair stylist Didier Malige cut and restyled Patitz's foot-long blonde hair into a cropped shag just above her shoulders. \\"Once I cut my hair - I cried for two months,\\" Patitz told Esquire magazine. \\"People said, 'We can't believe she cut her hair.'\\" But the move won Patitz covers of British and French editions of Vogue featuring her new look. The pinnacle of that year came in July and August when Patitz was awarded with consecutive covers of US Vogue - two months in a row. It was an unprecedented achievement for a model of that time and an innovation for the recently revamped Vogue under the leadership of new editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. This period was the zenith of Patitz's career, known as \\"the era of Tatjana\\" in the fashion industry - a whirlwind time when she seemed destined to walk away with the title of supermodel herself. During this period, in an effort to live a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, Patitz began slowing down her modeling career to focus on other creative pursuits such as writing, acting, and meditation. She relocated to California and made Los Angeles her homebase. The move afforded Patitz, who had always searched for creative and spiritual growth, the time and space to develop other aspects of her life. In the final months of 1989, Patitz was photographed with other top models in two portraits that would become key images of the supermodel era of the 1990s: \\"Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood, 1989\\" by Herb Ritts; and Peter Lindbergh's cover of the January 1990 issue of British Vogue. =1990s = The decade began with Patitz on the January covers of both the American and British editions of Vogue. She shared the British Vogue cover with Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington; the portrait of the five women is regarded as the cover that sparked the supermodel phenomenon of the 1990s, helping each woman attain global appeal. Photographed by Peter Lindbergh, the cover inspired pop star George Michael to cast Patitz, Crawford, Evangelista, Turlington and Campbell in his music video for the song \\"Freedom! '90\\" which was directed by David Fincher. Michael did not appear in the video; instead, each woman would lip-synch the song in Michael's place. While Patitz and her co-stars were already the top stars in the fashion world, they won major recognition for their beauty and charisma outside of it too. The music video was programmed into heavy rotation on MTV, going on to transcend the worlds of pop culture, music, and fashion in the 1990s and remaining influential and iconic in the decades to come. Settled in Los Angeles, Patitz continued to manage her modeling career while studying acting. She work mostly with Ritts, Lindbergh and Maser but was sought after by the industry's leading female photographers such as Peggy Sirota, Ellen Von Unwerth, Pamela Hanson and Sheila Metzner as well as new photographers such as Mario Sorrenti and Juergen Teller. Los Angeles-based photographers Phillip Dixon and Matthew Rolston also frequently photographed Patitz for Harper's Bazaar. Rolston said of Patitz: \\"I look for more than beauty. There must be a memorable quality. Tatjana has it more than anyone else. She sticks in your mind. There's a depth, an emotional quality to her that's truly extraordinary. She's very dear, charming and extremely feminine. She's very open and her priorities are natural things - animals, the sea, the environment. That's what's so interesting about her. She's not what she seems.\\" As the decade progressed, Patitz continued to work in advertising campaigns and on runways for such top fashion houses as Chanel, Versace, Salvatore Ferragamo, Valentino (fashion designer), Karl Lagerfeld, Helmut Lang (fashion brand), Donna Karan, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Vivienne Westwood. Most notably, Patitz was the long- standing face of Jil Sander, representing the designer's minimalist style for a generation of fashion readers in era-defining ad campaigns photographed by Nick Knight. Patitz also shared another cover with the supermodels of the era for the centennial issue of American Vogue (April 1992) photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. Patitz appeared on over 200 magazine covers worldwide, including seven covers of American Vogue and thirteen covers of British Vogue. French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Australian editions of Vogue have also featured Patitz on their covers and in editorials photographed by photographers such as Max Vadukul, Sante D'Orazio, Mikael Jannson, Arthur Elgort, Hans Feurer, Walter Chin, and Javier Vallhonrat. In advertising, Patitz won an exclusive cosmetic contract with Germaine Monteil makeup and perfumes. Regarded as one of the \\"Original Supermodels\\", she remains in demand periodically returning to the runway for select designers, such as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Chanel. Patitz has appeared in international television commercials for Cartier, L'Or√©al, Revlon, Levi (jeans), Corsa, Dupont, Pantene, Dockers, and Ralph Lauren. =Acting and other appearances= In 1987, she appeared in the Duran Duran music video for the song \\"Skin Trade\\". She then moved to California to begin a career as an actress. In 1988 she appeared in the Nick Kamen music video for \\"Tell Me\\". Her first appearance was a brief one as a murder victim in Rising Sun (1993). Following this, Patitz made several appearances on television series, music videos, and films. Her largest role was in the 1999 thriller Restraining Order. In 1990, Patitz was featured in George Michael's \\"Freedom! '90\\" music video, along with Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Naomi Campbell. In 2000, she appeared in the Korn music video for the song \\"Make Me Bad\\". Along with Michael J. Fox, she appears in the 2011 Carl Zeiss AG calendar, photographed by Bryan Adams in New York City in the summer of 2010. Personal life In 1989, Patitz went to live on a ranch in Malibu, California where in 2009 she was reported to have four horses, four dogs and two cats, commenting \\"I needed nature around me\\". She has a son, Jonah, who was born in 2004, and is separated from his father, a marketing executive.

The founder of the group Gondwanaland, McMahon was one of the first non-Aboriginal musicians to gain fame as a professional player of the instrument. He is also the inventor of the didjeribone, a sliding didgeridoo made from two lengths of plastic tubing and played somewhat in the manner of a trombone (hence its name). Early life In 1955, Jedda, the first Australian feature movie filmed in colour, was released, and the McMahons, living in the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney, were just one Australian family among many who went to see it. The film was notable for being the first mainstream Australian movie to have Aboriginal actors in the lead roles and characters that acknowledged the existence of, and identification with, an indigenous culture.\\"Myth of Charlie McMahon\\" Dusk Dundler Griffith Review #42 23.10.2013 Jedda, in the screenplay, is an Aboriginal girl adopted by a white station owner's wife to replace her own child who had died (coincidentally, the station owner's surname, McMann, is a variation of the Irish surname McMahon). Deliberately isolated from all contact with her birth family and relations, Jedda, is unsure of her identity until she meets Marbuck, a tribal Aboriginal man in trouble with the European system of justice. She is seduced by his intense didgeridoo playing but their elopement into the wilderness ends in tragedy when Marbuck's tribe rejects him for having broken its own laws regarding marriage. Marbuck, spurned by both the old and the new cultures, jumps off a cliff and takes Jedda with him.\\"Australian Drama\\" Australian Women's Weekly 13.10.54 p42 The movie was also significant for its presentation of panoramic outback scenery and its mixture of documentary and fiction (curiously, the destruction of the last reel of the film in a plane crash meant the movie's dramatic climax had to be refilmed in McMahon's home environment, the Blue Mountains).\\"A Lifelong Battle for Films of Australia\\" Brian Jeffrey Canberra Times 15.10.89 p 20 After the show young Charlie McMahon had been so absorbed by his cinema experience he tried to imitate the gut-stirring didge sound he heard in the movie by blowing into a garden hose and various hollow household objects like vacuum cleaner nozzles. He also developed an ongoing fascination with Aboriginals and their lives an unlikely interest for a four-year-old as \\"there weren't any black fellas living near us\\". He also took to running away and wandering in the scrub for comparatively long periods. Later, when he got older, he used to live off the land for a night and generally \\"went native\\" whenever he could.\\"This Years Thing\\" Miranda Brown Road Runner newspaper Vol 4 No 6 July 1981 Adelaide Australia p12 During 1958, when he was 7 years old, the McMahon family relocated from the Blue Mountains to the tough outer western suburb of Blacktown near Sydney, but McMahon still managed to find ways to \\"go bush\\" regularly.\\"Myth of Charlie McMahon\\" Dusk Dundler Griffith Review #42 23.10.2013 In 1967, McMahon blew off his right arm experimenting with a homemade rocket in a friend's backyard at Seven Hills, a neighbouring suburb of Blacktown. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper report of the incident stated that the friend, Ron Carley, had some of his fingers amputated so presumably both boys were holding the cylinder at the time it exploded.\\"Blast Costs Boys Arm\\" Sydney Morning Herald 10.9.67 p3 During a lengthy recuperation period getting used to his new metal arm (which, true to character, he wrapped in goanna hide) McMahon reactivated his earlier interest in didgeridoo playing, this time as therapy. At the same time he concentrated on previously neglected school work. During study breaks McMahon used to relax by going off to the sand flats of the Windsor River with his bongo playing brother Phil and some mates and the \\"westie tribe\\" would dress up in loincloths, paint their faces and have a corroboree.\\"Dreamtime Punk\\" People Magazine 15.9.1986 p36 With the wild side of his nature given an occasional outlet McMahon settled into study and won a university scholarship, achieving an honorary degree in Arts and Town Planning which led to him becoming, for a year, a lecturer and tutor in Town Planning at The University of Sydney. McMahon has said he became interested in studying town planning as a possible future way of correcting the all too obvious mistakes he found in the running of Blacktown. He wrote a treatise on the subject but became disillusioned when he realised the many political and vested interests trying to prevent the ideal becoming a reality.\\"This Years Thing\\" Miranda Brown Road Runner newspaper Vol 4 No 6 July 1981 Adelaide Australia p12 One fateful weekend at Australia's equivalent of Woodstock, the 1973 Nimbin Aquarius Festival, McMahon found himself intrigued by the performance of The White Company an experimental Theatre Troupe featuring a number of alternative culture artists including one Peter Carolan, a 25-year-old actor with roles in Australian TV's Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, The Rovers, and stage productions such as Servant of Two Masters, and Graham Bond's Drip Dry Dreams. Carolan came from a musical family. His mother played classical piano; his father was a professional jazz musician who performed on accordion, piano, organ, and synthesiser; and his paternal grandfather, Bart Carolan, was a composer and arranger who worked for a time at the BBC. The Carolan family had immigrated to Australia from England when Peter was 18. At the time his gift for creating flowing melodies \\"with spine\\" was noticed by McMahon, Carolan was playing lap dulcimer, an instrument to which he was attracted because of its simplicity ‚Äì \\"a primal drone, a strummed rhythm and a monophonic melody that could change mode by tuning\\". No direct communication between the two musicians was made at the festival but they had both noticed each other's presence. In 1974 a three-day arts festival season by the White Company at Sydney's Arts Castle venue included a performance by McMahon. After a productive post-show dulcimer and didgeridoo improvisation session in a dome on the roof of the venue the two players realised they had many attitudes towards music in common: McMahon was attracted to music with \\"atmosphere\\" while Peter had become interested in composing music that evoked a sense of \\"place\\" after hearing Maurice Jarre's 1962 score for the film Lawrence of Arabia. The two players made a vague promise to \\"do something in music together sometime in the future.Gwen Robinson \\"Blowing Sweet Harmony\\" unknown Australian newspaper 1984 In 1974, back at his day job, McMahon was growing increasingly disillusioned with what he later described as the \\"too much talk\\" atmosphere of campus academic life. During one particularly stifling lecture in a dungeon-like library basement with no windows and bare walls McMahon and his assistant interrupted their discussion of map interpretation with the impulsive act of encouraging the students to join them in painting the walls. This behaviour was seen by the University Chancellor as the ultimate act of confrontation and defiance of authority by an untameable teacher and McMahon was dismissed.\\"This Years Thing\\" Miranda Brown Road Runner newspaper Vol 4 No 6 July 1981 Adelaide Australia p12 He decided to do something more practical so he bought a property in a thickly forested valley on the south coast of New South Wales with two of his brothers and settled down to building a house the hard way by hand (and hook), all the time learning more about bush craft and living in a natural environment‚Äîskills that would come in handy for his next cycle of experience in the desert regions of Central Australia. In early 1978, McMahon jumped on stage during a Midnight Oil performance at French's Tavern in Sydney and added his didge sounds to their song \\"Stand in Line.\\" This marked the beginning of a friendship that was to last throughout both their music careers (in 1978 Midnight Oil had only played a half dozen or so gigs under that name).\\"Beds are Burning\\" Mark Dodshon Viking / Penguin Group Australia 2004 p148 After two and a half years of labouring and living on his diminishing savings he finished his bush retreat and was fortunate to be offered a job working for the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the position of a Development Coordinator in the Northern Territory, supervising outstation work grants to tribal people living hundreds of kilometres west of Alice Springs at the settlements of Kintore, Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia, and Papunya (the 1971 birthplace of the Australian Aboriginal dot painting revival). An important part of McMahon's initial work program to supervise the building of a store and meeting place for the local people as the levelling of an air strip for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. He also helped construct a 400 km chain of windmills and water bores in the Great Sandy Desert area, many times driving a three-ton water truck with only a thrown right hook to stabilise the steering wheel in rough country. Because of his obvious sincerity and work for the tribal communities McMahon was sometimes invited to observe traditional ceremonies held under the resplendent starlight of nighttime Central Australia.The Didjeridu From Arnhem Land to Internet\\" Karl Nuenfeldt editor Perfect Beat Publications 1997 Chapter Eight Shane Homan \\"Terra Incognita The Career of Charlie McMcMahon\\" p123 - 136 After 18 months he took some time off to gig with Midnight Oil, where he learned set dynamics and the art of talking to an audience from watching frontman Peter Garrett. 1980s In 1980, encouraged by Tony Walker, an announcer from Triple J (an Australian alternative music radio station), McMahon sold his Toyota Land Cruiser work truck and embarked on a two-month exploratory holiday to the United States starting in San Francisco, then going on to Los Angeles and Fresno. Some soundtrack work beckoned in Hollywood on a 1981 horror film called Wolfen but a musician's strike delayed the recording and, returning to San Francisco, McMahon, in the same week, missed his plane flight home and had his wallet, containing all his money, stolen creating the urgent need to find some way to earn a living wage and save for the air trip back to Australia. He found gigs on the daunting (and taunting) San Francisco punk club circuit and survived spectacularly with an improvised solo act alternating original didgeridoo compositions with stories based on memories of his desert experiences. He also involved himself musically on stage with whoever else was performing at the same venue. One such partnership resulted when McMahon was invited to join Timothy Leary's 1980 lecture tour for a few gigs. McMahon formed a band with some musicians he met in San Francisco: Mark Isham, Kurt Wortman, and Pat Cooley. They performed under the name The Yidaki Brothers and they did their own improvised acid rock take on the subjects of some of McMahon's stories. Another notable combination was with punk electronics group Indoor Life whose songs of urban frustration \\"buried in cement\\" were dominated by the sound of a trombone fed through a synthesizer. After five months of work he found himself earning about 500 dollars a week and quickly developing a fan base but, having reached one goal, financial, it was time to aim for the next one, creative, which for McMahon meant the recording of an album which he felt could only be done in Australia, the source of his musical inspiration.\\"This Years Thing\\" Miranda Brown Road Runner Vol 4 No 6 July 1981 Adelaide, Australia p12 /\\"Arnhem Land to Internet\\" The Didjeridu From Arnhem Land to Internet\\" Karl Nuenfeldt editor Perfect Beat Publications 1997 Chapter Eight Shane Homan \\"Terra Incognita The Career of Charlie McMcMahon\\" p123 - 136 McMahon returned to Sydney and, in 1981, received his first major Australia- wide publicity when the Adelaide music paper Roadrunner published a lengthy article with the intriguing heading \\"This Years Thing? One Armed Didgerdu Players? It's No Joke! Says Miranda Brown.\\"Miranda Brown ‚Äì Road Runner Vol 4 No 6 July 1981 Adelaide, Australia p12 As McMahon later stated, \\"I realised what I wanted to do was work with a good synth player ‚Äì a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I heard he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanaland.\\" They worked on their first composition, \\"Pulse,\\" inspired by the sound of a heartbeat. In the following months Carolan continued to create ideal music settings for McMahon's didgeridoo and expanded on his key image ideas such as an emu running, a drought, an eagle flying, and a landscape stretching beyond the horizon. Carolan's use of simple but powerful melodies linked to intelligently emotional arrangements openly conveyed in sound those poetic moments \\"when time stops and the joys, and mysteries of life are felt.\\"[19]Hot Records Press Release Terra Incognita lp 1984 In 1984 McMahon and Carolan assembled a small studio band of musician friends and recorded the first Gondwanaland album under the title Terra Incognita. When released on the small independent Hot label it was a critical and popular success. In October 1984, shortly after the debut of the first album, McMahon went \\"on the swag\\" again, only to be caught up in a sensationalist media drama when a group of nine Aboriginals, known as the Pintupi Nine, were encountered near the last of a chain of water bores he had been overseeing between Kintore and \\"the remotest outpost in Australia\\"‚ÄîKiwirrkurra. A visiting journalist hyped the incident into a biblical \\"finding of the lost tribe\\" but the people concerned were not \\"lost\\" but had instead \\"gone walkabout\\" after rejecting attempts by 1950s Woomera rocket range personnel to resettle them at Papuna. The small tribal group managed to go through their usual birth, initiation, marriage, and death rituals for decades, living off the natural resources of their desert environment before \\"coming in\\" to face the anger, and relief, of their relatives. McMahon's diary at the time noted \\"Tomorrow [16 Oct 1984] we will find the two men's tracks and maybe they will spend their last night free of the modern world\\".\\"Last of The Nomads\\" undated article The Bulletin Australia 2006 In April 1985 McMahon was flown to London to perform with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on the recording of Maurice Jarre's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome soundtrack. When he returned a month later an advertisement was placed in a music paper \\"Gondwana Wana Drummer.\\" Only one reply was received ‚Äì from an energetic multi ‚Äì format percussionist called Eddy Duquemin as equally at home on electric pad drums as he was on acoustic \\"skins'. He joined the live Gondwanaland band and McMahon decided to make the group his full time occupation. Because of his restless stage presence, Duquemin was soon given the nickname \\"Brolga\\" by McMahon‚Äîthe brolga being an Australian outback bird that is renowned for its dancing; Carolan had already been dubbed \\"Lizard,\\" although this was later changed to \\"Professor.\\"Gary Morris agency press release 1986 In November 1985, Midnight Oil commenced a 26-date local tour starting in Dubbo with Gondwanaland supporting. As well as feeding them to the mosh pit, this gave the newly constituted three piece some \\"tour of duty\\" exposure [if not exactly the type of audience they were hoping to attract]. In 1986, Let the Dog Out, Gondwanaland's second album, was released. It contained a bracket of aggressive, up-tempo numbers followed by two extended compositions, the first of which, \\"Ephemeral Lakes,\\" later became a regular choice for meditative ambient music compilations. Midnight Oil's Black Fella/White Fella tour of remote Northern Territory Aboriginal settlements in July 1986 recruited McMahon with the task of \\"co-ordinating the tour group's camping and guiding requirements and [contributing] plenty of common sense and a touch of sanity as well\\" A tour book entitled Strict Rules, by Andrew McMillan, and a video: \\"Black Fella White Fella,\\" were subsequently released and McMahon features in both.\\"Beds Are Burning\\" Mark Dodshon Viking / Penguin Group Australia 2004 In 1987, after a year of extensive live work in Sydney and an Arts Council sponsored four-week tour of the Northern Territory, the third album, self-titled Gondwanaland was released. It had taken many months to record and while the prolonged touring helped tighten the arrangements some of the groups intense live energy was diluted by the usual studio technique of making a separate recording of each member's instrumental part before a final mix. Despite this limitation the album won the Australian music industry's ARIA Award for best indigenous album of 1988. One track from this collection, the outstanding \\"Landmark,\\" features a dramatic use of McMahon's re-invention of an instrument first made in the 1970s in the UK by Dr Peter Holmes, the multi-tone, slide didgeridoo called \\"didjeribone.\\" In November 1988 Gondwanaland performed during the \\"Tomita Sound Cloud in Sydney ‚Äì Hymn To Mankind,\\" a A$3 million, Japanese government sponsored, light and sound, opera spectacular held on Sydney Harbour as part of the Australian Bicentennial celebrations. The concert attracted an audience of over 120,000 an Australian record for a live music event. 1990s to the present McMahon at Pine Creek, Northern Territory, Australia, July 2007 In 1991, Gondwanaland's Wide Skies was released and even long time followers of the band were surprised at the progression of Carolan's compositions. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection. Now complex panoramic chord clusters enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming evocation of the sky and all that happens in and under it. This album's multi-layered textures and moods earned the band even greater critical respect. In 1994, after the great leap forward of Wide Skies, McMahon formed a second band, Gondwana, with an emphasis on rhythm and increasingly dominant bass and experimental didge sounds. The band released three albums: Travelling, Xenophon, and Bone Man, with the last two featuring another McMahon innovation: the mouth-held use of a geologist's seismic microphone to amplify the growling subsonic didge dynamics. This approach to music gave McMahon a new audience: the trance/dance crowd. A success evidenced by the placing of a Gondwana tune in the all important opening track position on each of the two volumes of highly successful Australian trance/dance compilation series. In 2005 McMahon experienced a bizarre case of d√©j√† vu when he found himself, 20 years after his 1985 London Mad Max soundtrack work, in Russia with a new manager associated with a Mad Max Smash and Crash \\"theme park.\\" The episode was made the subject of a quirky Foreign Correspondent report in March 2006.\\"Mad Max Goes To Moscow\\" Foreign Correspondent 7.3.2006 ABC broadcast transcript In 2006 Peter Carolan released a sampler CD called Overland, collecting examples, old and new, of his various music explorations. Two of the new tracks, \\"Airwaves\\" and \\"Dragonflies,\\" have a strong Gondwanaland feel to them, and even though only samples of McMahon's didgeridoo are used, Carolan's Gondwanaland composing style, abandoned when McMahon left Australia and took to touring international big city venues 12 years ago, now appeared to be reactivated and continuing where it left off, this time influenced by the McMahons recent Gondwana albums. For over 20 years McMahon's assertive didgeridoo playing style has remained an obvious (and usually unacknowledged) influence for many well known didgeridoo players, both black and white. Currently he can be seen performing, mainly solo, on the world music festival circuit in Europe, Japan, Russia, the United States, and Australia. He has two acts: one set featuring the seismic sensor he calls The Face Bass the other is a playful exploration of the musical and experimental tone possibilities of the didjeribone. In August 2008 McMahon released a DVD storage disc library of over 800 didge samples under the title \\"Rhythm Organism\\". On 24 April 2012 McMahon released a subdued and mellow Gondwana album called \\"Didge Heart\\". On 28 July 2012 Peter Carolan died at the age of 64 from the effects of a respiratory illness.

It replaced the Archbishopric of Magdeburg after its secularization by Brandenburg. The duchy's capitals were Magdeburg and Halle, while Burg was another important town. Dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807, its territory was made part of the Province of Saxony in 1815. History The Roman Catholic Archbishopric of Magdeburg began to be administered by secular princes, mostly Lutheran, in 1545 during the Protestant Reformation. In the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the archbishopric was promised to the House of Hohenzollern of the Margraviate of Brandenburg upon the death of its incumbent administrator, August, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels.Fay, p. 49 The city of Magdeburg was also required to pay homage to the prince-electors of Brandenburg.Koch, p. 48 In 1666, Elector Frederick William used his developing army to install a permanent Brandenburger garrison in the city.Holborn, p. 29 Brandenburg-Prussia inherited the Archbishopric of Magdeburg upon the death of August of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1680 and reorganized the secularized territory as the Duchy of Magdeburg, with the electors of Brandenburg as hereditary dukes. The Halle region (Saalkreis), an exclave of the province, was surrounded by the Principality of Anhalt, the County of Mansfeld (acquired by Prussia in 1790), and the Electorate of Saxony.Westermann, p. 106 Against the wishes of the duchy's Lutheran nobility, a Calvinist chancellor was appointed to govern the duchy.Clark, p. 127 Through the leadership of August Hermann Francke, Halle became the center of Pietism in Brandenburg-Prussia. When Elector Frederick III crowned himself Frederick I, King in Prussia, in 1701, the Duchy of Magdeburg became part of the new Kingdom of Prussia. King Frederick William I's 'allodification of the fiefs', or efforts to modernize feudal land ownership laws, was opposed by the duchy's Junker nobility, which feared losing their tax-exempt status. The nobles received judgements from the imperial court in Vienna protecting their rights in 1718 and 1725.Clark, p. 91 Justus Henning B√∂hmer became chancellor of the province in 1743. With the creation of the General Directory in 1723 by Frederick William I, the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Principality of Halberstadt, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg were administered by the second department of the General Directory.Koch, p. 91 A state-capitalized agricultural credit union (Landschaft) was created in the duchy in 1780 for the exclusive use of the nobility.Clark, p. 159 Control over the Magdeburg lands gave the monarchy a lucrative monopoly over the Stassfurt and Halle salt deposits.Fay, p. 77 The estates of Pomerania voluntarily raised 5,000 troops for the Prussian Army during the Seven Years' War; their initiative was duplicated by the nobility of Magdeburg and neighboring provinces.Clark, p. 220 In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Prussia was defeated by Napoleon in 1806. In the Treaty of Tilsit the following year, the Duchy of Magdeburg was dissolved. The ducal territory west of the Elbe River, including the cities Magdeburg and Halle, were made part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, a client state of the First French Empire.Holborn, 385 The ducal territory east of the Elbe remained in a drastically reduced Kingdom of Prussia. Prussia reacquired the Magdeburg and Halle territories during the War of the Sixth Coalition. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, the territories of the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Altmark, and part of the Kingdom of Saxony were coalesced to create the new Prussian Province of Saxony.

He invented a gull-wing aircraft design, also known as \\"Pu≈Çawski wing\\" and constructed a series of Polish PZL fighters. He was born in Lublin. In the summer of 1920, during the Soviet offensive in the Polish-Soviet War, he volunteered for a Boy Scout battalion. In late 1920 he commenced studies at Warsaw University of Technology. He was a member of the Aviation Section of the Students' Mechanical Club, where he constructed some gliders. He distinguished himself as a thorough and able student. In 1925 he graduated from the University, receiving the Engineer title, and left for practice in the Breguet works in France. After his return, he served in the national service, completing military aviation school in Bydgoszcz and becoming a pilot. From 1927 he became a main designer of the Central Aviation Workshops (CWL) at S≈Çupecka Street in Warsaw, soon reorganized into the PZL (Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze - State Aviation Works). To meet a requirement of the Polish military department, in 1928 Pu≈Çawski designed a modern all-metal high-wing fighter with an inline engine, PZL P.1. For the P.1, he invented a gull-wing design, giving the pilot an excellent view from his cockpit. The P.1 was flown in 1929 and met with great interest in the world. Its wing design became also known as \\"Pu≈Çawski wing\\" or \\"Polish wing\\", and was later copied in some other designs in the world. The P.1 was not produced, in a favour of Pu≈Çawski's next designs with a radial engine, preferred by the Polish Air Force. A development of the P/1 was the PZL P.6 with a radial engine, first flown in 1930. With a pilot Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski, it won a National Air Races in the USA. It was named the best fighter in the world by some of military press at that time. Its improved variant, PZL P.7, was produced for the Polish Air Force (150 made). In early 1931 Pu≈Çawski designed another fighter development PZL P.8, returning to his favourite inline engine. In 1930, he was also ordered to start working upon the P.7 development, with a stronger engine and begun design work upon the PZL P.11 then. Pu≈Çawski also flew aircraft in the Warsaw Aeroclub. He died on March 21, 1931 in a crash of his newest amphibious flying boat PZL.12 in Warsaw, at the age of 29 (the plane fell due to strong wind, after take-off). After his death, the PZL P.11 project was finished by Wsiewo≈Çod Jakimiuk, becoming the main Polish fighter during the Invasion of Poland 1939. Additionally, a faster export model PZL P.24, based entirely on Pu≈Çawski's construction features, was developed and sold to some countries. Pu≈Çawski was one of the most talented Polish designers. Partly due to his death, Pu≈Çawski's fighters, most modern in the early 1930s, had not been replaced with modern successors before 1939, when they were already obsolete.

For the current truck stop chain, see Pilot Flying J. FJ Management Inc.,http://www.flyingj.com/flyingjPortalWebProject/flyingjPortal.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=flyingjPortal_portal_page_26_page_27&_subpage=21 formerly known as Flying J Inc., is a privately held American corporation which operates convenience stores, oil & refining, banking, and insurance businesses. Along with Pilot Corporation and Berkshire Hathaway, it is a joint-owner of Pilot Flying J (the largest truck stop chain in the United States), and Maverik convenience stores. History The company was founded in 1968 by O. Jay Call and headquartered in Ogden, Utah. A lifelong fan of aviation, Call named it Flying J in honor of the aviation industry. Mr. Call, his wife, Irene, and Richard \\"Buzz\\" Germer died while piloting a Cessna Citation en route to Sun Valley in March 2003. The legacy Flying J logo. Still used at Flying J locations operated by Pilot Flying J. The company ranked 13th on Forbes 2009 list of the largest privately held companies in the U.S.with 2008 revenues of approximately $18.00 billion. It sought Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection in December 2008, blaming its financial woes on the collapse in oil prices and tighter credit markets. Pre-bankruptcy, Flying J was the largest retailer of diesel fuel in North America with approximately 220 locations in the United States and Canada and 15,000 employees. The company produces and refines petroleum products for its truck stops. The company also offers vehicle maintenance, banking, insurance and telecommunications services for the trucking industry, and a number of restaurants at its locations. The company had record sales for a privately held company in the industry of $18.0 billion in 2008, but later climbing prices for crude oil and a crumbling demand for gasoline eroded margins and affected cash flow. Flying J is cited by the Terror-Free Oil Initiative as a company that does not purchase oil from terrorism-sponsoring nations. The company's plans for travel plazas have occasionally met opposition from local residents concerned about traffic safety and other issues. In 2006 Flying J associated with Shell Canada to improve highway services in Canada. Pilot merger In July 2009, Pilot Travel Centers agreed to acquire Flying J's travel stops. As part of the deal, Pilot will keep the Flying J name on existing locations as opposed to converting them to the Pilot brand, while the in-house Flying J restaurants will be replaced by national chains like Denny's. The merged entity will be called Pilot Flying J. Maverik branded gas pump in Gillette, Wyoming In June 2010, Flying J put forth a Chapter 11 plan to repay all creditors in full from the proceeds of the sale of its 250 travel plazas to Pilot, for a combination of cash and stock valued at $1.6 billion. Under Flying J's plan, its lenders and creditors will be paid in cash, and its owners, whose numbers include members of the company's founding Call family, will retain all the equity in a scaled-down Flying J. As of July 2010, hearings on the plan continue under Judge Mary F. Walrath of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Flying J's oil & refining, banking, & insurance businesses will remain separate from the combined Pilot Flying J.http://www.standard.net/topics/business/2010/07/01/merger-official-today- two-companies To avoid confusion with the merged travel center business, Flying J Inc. renamed itself FJ Management Inc.. Since the merger, Pilot Flying J has continued to open new locations with the Flying J name (in addition to the Pilot name), bringing in locations with the Flying J brand that had no association with the legacy Flying J before the merger. To settle antitrust concerns, six Flying J locations as well as 20 Pilot locations were sold to Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores on June 30, 2010. On October 3, 2017, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would acquire a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J, with plans to increase the stake to 80% by 2023.

There are two main types of security parameter: computational and statistical, often denoted by \\\\kappa and \\\\lambda, respectively. Roughly speaking, the computational security parameter is a measure for the input size of the computational problem on which the cryptographic scheme is based, which determines its computational complexity, whereas the statistical security parameter is a measure of the probability with which an adversary can break the scheme (whatever that means for the protocol). Security parameters are usually expressed in unary representation - i.e. \\\\kappa is expressed as a string of \\\\kappa 1s, \\\\kappa=1\\\\cdots 1, conventionally written as 1^\\\\kappa \\\\- so that the time complexity of the cryptographic algorithm is polynomial in the size of the input. Computational security The security of cryptographic primitives relies on the hardness of some hard problem. One sets the computational security parameter \\\\kappa such that O(2^{\\\\kappa}) computation is considered intractable. =Examples= * If the security of a scheme depends on the secrecy of a key for a pseudorandom function (PRF), then we may specify that the PRF key should be sampled from the space \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^\\\\kappa so that a brute- force search requires O(2^\\\\kappa) computational power. * In the RSA cryptosystem, the security parameter \\\\kappa denotes the length in bits of the modulus n; the positive integer n must therefore be a number in the set {0, ‚Ä¶, 2\\\\kappa \\\\- 1}. Statistical security Security in cryptography often relies on the fact that statistical distance between * a distribution predicated on a secret, and * a simulated distribution produced by an entity that does not know the secret is small. We formalise this using the statistical security parameter by saying that the distributions are statistically close if the statistical distance between distributions can be expressed as a negligible function in the security parameter. One sets the statistical security parameter \\\\sigma such that O(2^{-\\\\sigma}) is considered a \\"small enough\\" chance of the adversary winning. Consider the following two broad categories of attack of adversaries on a given cryptographic scheme: attacks in which the adversary tries to learn secret information, and attacks in which the adversary tries to convince an honest party to accept a false statement as true (or vice versa). In the first case, for example a public-key encryption scheme, an adversary may be able to obtain a large amount of information from which he can attempt to learn secret information, e.g. by examining the distribution of ciphertexts for a fixed plaintext encrypted under different randomness. In the second case, it may be that the adversary must guess a challenge or a secret and can do so with some fixed probability; in this we can talk about distributions by considering the algorithm for sampling the challenge in the protocol. In _both_ cases, we can talk about the chance of the adversary \\"winning\\" in a loose sense, and can parameterise the statistical security by requiring the distributions to be statistically close in the first case or defining a challenge space dependent on the statistical security parameter in the second case. =Examples= * In encryption schemes, one aspect of security is (at a high level) that anything that can be learnt about a plaintext given a ciphertext can also be learnt from a randomly-sampled string (of the same length as ciphertexts) that is independent of the plaintext. Formally, one would need to show that a uniform distribution over a set of strings of fixed length is statistically close to a uniform distribution over the space of all possible ciphertexts. * In zero knowledge protocols, we can further subdivide the statistical security parameters into zero knowledge and soundness statistical security parameters. The former parameterises what the transcript leaks about the secret knowledge, and the latter parameterises the chance with which a dishonest prover can convince an honest verifier that he knows a secret even if he doesn't. * In universal composability, the security of a protocol relies on the statistical indistinguishability of distributions of a real-world and an ideal-world execution. Interestingly, for a computationally unbounded environment it is not sufficient for distributions to be statistically indistinguishable since the environment can run the experiment enough times to observe which distribution is being produced (real or ideal); however, any standalone adversary against the protocol will only win with negligible probability in the statistical security parameter since it only engages in the protocol once.

She was a cast member in five TV series: The Jackie Gleason Show (1956‚Äì1957), Bracken's World (1969‚Äì1970), The Paul Lynde Show (1972‚Äì1973), CPO Sharkey (1976‚Äì1977) and the daytime drama Texas (1980‚Äì1981) while also maintaining a thriving theatrical career as a musical comedy star and receiving two Tony nominations, in 1962 for The Gay Life and in 1965 for Do I Hear a Waltz?. Early life Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, Allen began her career as a Ford Agency high-fashion model.  Television  Allen landed the television role of the \\"Away We Go!\\" girl on The Jackie Gleason Show in the 1950s. She made numerous television appearances in guest starring roles on such programs as The Fugitive, Kojak, and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. She was also a regular cast member on TV's Bracken's World, The Paul Lynde Show, C.P.O. Sharkey, Another World and its spin-off, Texas. Her television, film and stage career spanned three decades. She was featured with William Shatner in \\"The Hungry Glass\\", the 16th episode in the first season of Boris Karloff's Thriller in 1961.\\"The Hungry Glass\\" IMDB Database In 1962, she played a leading role in the first season of Combat!, in the episode \\"No Hallelujahs for Glory\\" as a persistent war correspondent. Allen is perhaps best known on TV for her role as the creepy saleslady in the first-season episode of Rod Serling's original version of The Twilight Zone, entitled \\"The After Hours\\", where actress Anne Francis (playing 'Miss Marsha White') finally realizes that she is a mannequin and that her month of freedom and living among the humans is over. Allen's saleslady character (seen by no one but Marsha) is the mannequin whose turn in the outside world is up next and has already been delayed by one full day, thus explaining her slightly peeved attitude. With John Wayne in Donovan's Reef (1963)  Film  In 1963, Allen starred with John Wayne, Dorothy Lamour and Lee Marvin in the John Ford film Donovan's Reef. She also starred in Diamond Head with Charlton Heston and Yvette Mimieux. Both movies were filmed on location in Hawaii. Allen also appeared with James Stewart in Cheyenne Autumn and won a Laurel Award in 1963 as the year's most promising film actress.  Stage  Allen honed her stage skills by joining and performing with the Helen Hayes Repertory Group before expanding into the big and small screens. Allen was twice nominated for Tony Awards for her performances on Broadway in The Gay Life, as Actress, Supporting or Featured (Musical) (1962) and Do I Hear a Waltz?, as Best Actress in a Musical (1965). She can be heard singing throughout the original cast album of Waltz, available on CD. Her other notable stage productions on the Great White Way and beyond included Romanoff and Juliet, Lend an Ear, Sherry!, California Suite, The Pajama Game, The Tender Trap, Show Boat, South Pacific, and culminating in the 1980s Broadway musical 42nd Street, as fading star Dorothy Brock. In 1983 she appeared as Dr. Gwen Harding on the CBS soap opera Guiding Light. Allen quietly retired from show business in 1996, after touring numerous cities throughout the world for over a decade with her 42nd Street role from Broadway. This was her last, significant acting job after appearing in the 1980s TV series Texas for two seasons. Other activities In the late 1970s, Allen ventured into retail business as she operated a dress store in a San Fernando Valley shopping mall. Entertainment columnist Dick Kleiner reported: \\"She found a vacant store, rented it, decorated it. She does all her own buying and delivering ... and a lot of the selling.\\" She told Kleiner that she thought it wise \\"for an actress to have something going for her when there is nothing doing on the acting front.\\" Personal life and death She was married briefly to Baron Karl von Vietinghoff-Scheel, but they divorced and she never remarried. Allen later appeared on the game show, Tattletales in the 1970's as the partner of Charles Nelson Reilly, though Reilly was gay in real life. This was done so that Reilly could appear on the show. Allen died from kidney disease, aged 77, in Fishkill, New York. She was predeceased by her only sibling, brother Joseph L. Gillease, and survived by her sister-in-law, Marion Gillease, her nephew and godson, Patrick J. Gillease, her niece, Erin Gillease Phelan, and two grand-nieces, Alicia Phelan and Alexandria Phelan.

'Baal-zephon or Baalsapunu, properly Ba P≈´n≈´ or sapunu (; ; ), was the form of the Canaanite storm god Ba øal ( \\"The Lord\\") in his role as lord of Mount Zaphon; he is identified in the Ugaritic texts as Hadad. Because of the mountain's importance and location, it came to metonymously signify \\"north\\" in Hebrew; the name is therefore sometimes mistakenly given in translation as . He was equated with the Greek god Zeus in his form and later with the Roman '. Because Ba øal Zaphon was considered a protector of maritime trade, sanctuaries were constructed in his honor around the Mediterranean by his Canaanite and Phoenician devotees. \\"Baal-zephon\\" thereby also became a placename, most notably a location mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures' Book of Exodus as the location where the Israelites miraculously crossed the Red Sea during their exodus from Egypt. God The name Ba øal Zaphon never appears in the mythological texts discovered at Ugarit. Instead, it occurs in guides to ritual and in letters, where it is used to differentiate this form of Ba øal from others such as Ba øal Ugarit. The earliest discovered depiction of the god‚Äîwhere he stands astride two mountains in a smiting posture‚Äîdates to the 18th century . Other depictions show him crowned and bearing a scepter. As a protector of maritime trade, his temples also received votive stone anchors. The treaty between Asarhaddon and King Ba øal of Tyre ranks Ba øal Zaphon third behind Ba øal Shamem and Ba øal Malage. In addition to his temple at Jebel Aqra and Ugarit, Ba øal Zaphon is known to have been worshipped at Tyre and Carthage and served as the chief god of the colony at Tahpanes. A 14th-century letter from the king of Ugarit to the Egyptian pharaoh places Ba øal Zaphon as equivalent to Amun. Temples to Zeus Kasios are attested in Egypt, Athens, Epidauros, Delos, Corfu, Sicily, and Spain, with the last mention occurring on Rome's German border in the 3rd century. Location 1st-millennium Assyrian texts mention Ba øal Zaphon as the name of the mountain itself. (Locally as well, the mountain was worshipped in its own right.) The books of Exodus and Numbers in the Hebrew Scriptures records that the Israelites were instructed by YHWH to camp across from a place named \\"Ba øal Zaphon\\" in order to appear trapped and thereby entice the Pharaoh to pursue them:.. Gmirkin identified this as Arsinoe on the Gulf of Suez. A Ptolemaic-era geographical text at the Cairo Museum lists four border fortresses, the third being \\"Midgol and Ba øal Zaphon\\". In context, it appears to have been located on a route to the Red Sea coast, perhaps on the canal from Pithom to a location near Arsinoe. According to Herodotus (who considered it to mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria), at Ras Kouroun, a small mountain near the marshy Lake Bardawil, the \\"Serbonian Bog\\" of Herodotus, where Zeus' ancient opponent Typhon was \\"said to be hidden\\".Lane Fox 2009:253-56.

It was filmed in locations in the U.S. and Canada including the small town of Delia, Alberta.  Plot  Matty Demaret (Barry Pepper) is the son of a mob boss, but he is used as little more than an errand boy. His relative and friend Chris (Andrew Davoli) shares this urge to be part of something bigger, and Matty finally convinces his father to give him a job, with the help of his father's right-hand man Teddy (John Malkovich). Matty and Chris get their friend Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) to fly up to retrieve a bag full of money for Matty's father Benny \\"Chains\\" Demaret (Dennis Hopper), as there have been mysterious shortages in their money lately. On the way back with the cash, Marbles stops in a small Montana town to refuel his personal plane. He has been instructed to guard the bag with his life so he takes the bag with him as he goes to pay for the fuel. However, Marbles sees the sheriff and his deputy and is paranoid that they may question him about the bag's contents. Marbles is also in possession of cocaine which he dumps on the runway. He drops the bag amongst a pile of luggage waiting to be loaded onto another flight, and despite trying to rush the cashier with the offer of a large tip, the commercial flight takes off before he can retrieve his bag. Unknown to him, the bag of money was taken by two local young skateboarders who work as baggage handlers at the airport. Marbles is slightly built, and loathe to enter into confrontations. He is also not terribly intuitive, outsmarted by the two local young men who take the money as their own and begin spending it. Marbles is either unable to think this out to its logical conclusion, or he is intimidated by the young locals and unable to confront them. Whether through fear of the young men, or ignorance of their involvement, his incompetence wastes time and Marbles is forced to call upon his stronger and more experienced friends to search for the cash. Whether unknowingly or unwillingly able to confront the younger men on his own, he calls Matty and tells him the news. Matty, though upset, knows that he must fix the situation quickly and quietly if he ever wants to work for his father. Matty, Chris, and their friend Taylor (Vin Diesel) fly to the small town of Wibaux, Montana to help Marbles search for the missing money. While in town, Matty and the other guys attract the attention of two local law-enforcement officers (Tom Noonan and Shawn Doyle) who find out about the money and want to keep it for themselves. The mob guys then try to negotiate with the officers to get the money back but are turned away. Matty calls Teddy and Teddy arrives in Wibaux with two other mob henchmen. Chris decides to leave for home and disappears. Marbles hangs around in a bar with the two mob henchmen who secretly hate him, while Taylor and Matty wait in their hotel for word from the Sheriff. After taking him outside in a friendly manner, the two mob men throw Marbles to the ground and ask where Chris is. Marbles, defending his friend, tells them he doesn't know and one of the men shoots him dead and puts his body in a trunk. Later that night, a deal is arranged for the Sheriff and Deputy to meet Matty and Taylor in an abandoned abattoir. When they arrive, the lawmen are planning to kill Matty and the others and keep the money, but Teddy and the two mobsters show up when Matty and Taylor do, turning the meeting into a Mexican standoff. Chris arrives and shoots the Sheriff's cousin who came to help the Sheriff, and Matty and Taylor inquire about Marbles. Chris says that he thought he was with them. Chris is killed by Teddy's men. In the chaos, the sherrif and deputy shoot and kill Teddy's men. Taylor then kills both of the lawmen. As Teddy prepares to shoot Matty, Taylor pushes Matty out of the way and is shot in the arm. Matty accuses Teddy of stealing money from his father. Teddy claims that Matty doesn't have the guts to shoot him and attempts to shoot Matty. Matty quickly shoots Teddy in the chest several times, killing him. Matty and Taylor get the money and return home. Matty hands the bag of money to his father and quits the family business before driving off with Taylor.

In the 2001 National Census it had a population of 2,138. Renton is particularly famous for the village's association football side. Renton was one of the 11 founder members of the Scottish Football League and winners of the 1885 and 1888 Scottish Cup, producing many famous players.  History  The Renton takes its name from Cecilia Renton (daughter-in-law of Tobias Smollett) after whom the modern sandstone, 'model' village was named in 1762. Dalquhurn Bleachworks in 1715 and Cordale Printworks in 1770 were responsible for attracting new industrial workers. At the north of the village stood the Place of Bonhill, a residence from 1642, to the South was Dalquhurn House. Two parallel north-south streets, Main Street and Back Street were first joined by Station Street, Stirling Street, Burns Street, Thimble Street, Market Street and Red Row. In late Victorian times, the village extended southwards to Leven Street, Alexander Street and John Street. Further expansion occurred in the 1930s as housing was built in the grounds of Cordale House. In the early 1960s the majority of the sandstone properties in the village were compulsory purchased by Dumbarton County Council, demolished and replaced by Dumbarton County Council with 1960s Brutalist-style concrete houses and flats; the majority of which have been replaced by proper houses, own front & back door, by the Cordale Housing Association. It has traditionally been a stronghold of radical left-wing politics; during the 1930s it had Communist councillors, Bunger Lamont, never toed the Labour Party line and independent councillors such as Jimmy McKenzie (1960/70s), and since 1999 it has been represented on West Dunbartonshire council by Jim Bollan, at present the Scottish Socialist Party's only councillor. It lies on the main road, A82 as was, between Alexandria and Dumbarton. Renton railway station is on the line from Glasgow to Balloch. It has a footbridge across the River Leven to the Strathleven Industrial Estate (once a major source of employment), and a minor road, with a steep 33% hill, across Carman Hill to Cardross. = Robert the Bruce's manor house = Despite a report that appeared in The Observer on Sunday 22 February 2009(1) stating that the buried ruins of the manor house of Robert the Bruce had been found in the Pillanflatt area of Renton, this interpretation has yet to be confirmed. While there is strong Charter evidence to indicate the presence of a manor or hunting lodge belonging to Bruce in the area, this is more likely to have been located in the vicinity of Mains of Cardross, to the south of the Pillanflat, rather than in the area to the north of it. Stone, plaster and mortar are not generally susceptible to scientific dating techniques, and lime mortar was used from the Roman period up to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. According to Bruce Historian Stuart Smith, a charter dating from 1362 charter states that Robert the Bruce resided between Kings Park of Cardross and the lands of Pillanflatt, bounding the lands of Dalquhurn. This would suggest a site to the south of the Pillanflat, but to the north of Castle Park, in the vicinity of what is now Mains of Cardross. = Modern Times = In recent times, Renton has seen some major social regeneration most notably, although not restricted to, housing.  Notable residents  Before Renton existed in its current form Robert the Bruce lived and died at the Manor of Cardross, the exact location of which is uncertain, but may have been near or in what is now Renton, although it was probably in Cardross Parish.GWS Barrow, 'Robert the Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland' The writer Tobias Smollett was born in Dalquhurn House in what is now Renton in 1721 and is commemorated by Smollett Monument in the village', erected by his cousin three years after the author's death in Italy in 1771. MP and Lord Provost Duncan McLaren was born in Renton, as was MP in, and speaker of, the Canadian House of Commons, James Allison Glen and author Jane Duncan. Professional footballers Alex Jackson, Andy Duncan, John O'Hare, Jack Ashurst, and James Kelly all originated in Renton, as did boxer Skeets Gallacher, after whom Gallacher Way is named.  Sport  When Renton F.C. won the World Cup, the footballing world was in its infancy in 1888, almost exclusively played by Scottish and English clubs. It was a World Cup Championship by default ‚Äì nevertheless Renton's claim is undisputed. They won the Scottish Cup with a 6-1 thrashing of Cambuslang F.C. Then they humbled English Cup holders West Bromwich Albion, who had prepared in Scotland for two weeks. The score was 4-1 in front of a record 10,000 fans at Hampden Park. Renton endorsed their title with an away win against \\"The Invincibles\\" of Preston North End. A \\"Champion of the World\\" sign was proudly displayed on the pavilion at Tontine Park. They were ahead of their time in training for stamina and strength. Their weapon was Renton's own famous \\"chicken bree\\", the ingredients never disclosed but it was probably port wine switched with a couple of eggs administered daily. Quoiting (pronounced kiteing) was a popular sport amongst the male villagers. Quoiting greens were found in Renton, Alexandria, Hardgate and many Ayrshire villages. Quoits were heavy iron rings, rounded on one side, flat on the other and weighed but could be up to . They were hurled at a steel pin driven into a square clay bed, with the common length of the green being . Renton were Scottish Champions in 1949 and 1986. There is a photograph of the victorious 1949 team in Renton Railway Station.  Facilities  There are several recreational and consumer related facilities in Renton.

It is used in perfume making, has been written about as an aphrodisiacJeff Klinkenberg, Seasons of Florida and is the state flower of Florida. It is traditionally associated with good fortune and has been popular in bridal bouquets and head wreaths for weddings. Orange blossom essence is an important component in the making of perfume. The petals of orange blossom can also be made into the delicately scented orange flower water (as an alternative to rose water), a common part of both French cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine (most often as an ingredient in desserts and baked goods). In the United States, orange flower water is used to make orange blossom scones and marshmallows. Orange blossom honey (citrus honey) is produced by putting beehives in the citrus groves during blooming period. This also pollinates seeded citrus varieties. Orange blossom honey is highly prized and tastes much like the fruit. The orange blossom gives its touristic nickname to the Costa del Azahar (\\"orange-blossom coast\\"), the Castellon seaboard. In Spain, fallen blossoms are dried and then used to make tea. A French electronic and world music band has taken the name Orange Blossom.

Denmark, 2005. Combat reenactment is a side of historical reenactment which aims to depict historical forms of combat. This may refer to either single combat, melees involving small groups, or nearly full-scale battles with hundreds of participants. Depending on the intended effect, performances may have the aim of presenting historical martial arts reconstruction, or just offer entertainment, and different groups have different standards of authenticity. Historical martial arts demonstrations German longsword demonstration at Furor et Ferrum 2007 (the action is the final stage of a \\"going-through\\" with a throw). Demonstration of historical fencing begins with Alfred Hutton in the 1890s. The Association for Renaissance Martial Arts distinguishes the following modes of historical martial arts demonstrations: *Theatrical Fencing (stage-combat, performance fighting) in the sense of a performance art, not a martial art, although relying on a foundation of martial techniques and principles, serving the end of dramatic entertainment. *Arranged Performance Fighting, as distinct from both theatrical fencing and historical swordsmanship practiced as a martial art, having the purpose of demonstration and education. Such performances are offered by a number of museums, including the Higgins Armory Museum, Worcester, MA, USA and the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. *Mock-Fighting & Martial Sports, including simulated battle presentations and tournament bouts in living history or live-action role-playing games with special \\"combat rules\\". =Competitions= In the 2000s, several competition events for choreographed historical martial arts demonstrations were originated, combining the judgement of aspects of historical fencing techniques, stage combat qualities like acting and entertainment value, as well as historical accuracy of costumes and equipment. *Furor et Ferrum Pavone Canavese, Italy (since 2004) *Stage Warriors Osterburken, Germany (since 2004) *International German Championship in Stage Fencing Berlin, Germany (since 2006, includes a category \\"Antiquity to Middle Ages\\") Joust A contemporary knight jousting at a Renaissance Fair in Livermore, California, 2006. Today, tent pegging is the only form of jousting officially recognized by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports. Ring jousting became the official state sport of Maryland in 1962\\"Maryland Jousting Tournament Association\\", retrieved 2007 and was the first official sport of any American state. The Italian town of Arezzo continues to hold an annual jousting tournament, which dates to the Crusades.. Modern theatrical medieval-style jousting competitions are popular at American Renaissance fairs and similar festivals, and feature riders on horseback attempting various feats of skill with the lance, which may not always have a basis in history.\\"Society Equestrian Marshal\\", retrieved 2007 Battle reenactment Reenactment of battles is a major and popular component of historical reenactment. Due to the number of participants involved, most reenacted battles cannot be choreographed in any detail, and safety guidelines or \\"combat rules\\" are imposed on participants instead, prohibiting most realistic actions. Some reenactment battles take the form of a competition, where the two \\"armies\\" try to defeat each other within the actions permitted by the combat rules. Battles in film are not inhibited by such restrictions, due to the possibilities of cutting and closeup. They are fully choreographed, and are not performed in a single go but divided into individual sequences. Combat as interactive martial art The Society for Creative Anachronism fighting is based on Medieval fighting on foot, in the spirit of tournament fighting with wooden swords. The armor is handmade and based on historical artifacts. Unlike most reenactment events, the events are not pre-determined. It's a participatory sport; the fighters win or lose a bout, much like Karate or Judo. Combat rules *Codex Belli *Early Medieval Alliance Equipment Since the 1990s, an increasing number of companies offers replicas of historical arms and armour. Blade weapons used for combat reenactment are unsharpened, and specialized sparring weapons (e.g. Albion's \\"Maestro Line\\") also have rounded points. Blunt, flail and staff weapons are more problematic since the replica essentially has the same effectiveness as the \\"serious\\" version, unless rattan or latex weapons are employed, which in turn lack the characteristics of the originals and induce handling techniques inconsistent with the weapons they are supposed to represent.

For example, in most northern European medieval reenactment cotton is an inauthentic material--as opposed to wool or linen--though it would be authentic in more modern periods and events, such as American Civil War reenactment or World War II reenactment. Likewise, pop culture references and talking about modern events or objects (e.g., wrist watches, mobile phones, or contemporary politicians) is inauthentic. Generally, the ratio of events and groups enforcing strict authenticity to those permitting (limited) in authenticity among the participating reenactors is estimated to be half- and-half, i.e., there are approximately as many groups enforcing historical accuracy as there are permitting a more liberal use of the term \\"authentic\\". This does, however, vary from country to country. Degrees In the US, reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for authenticity. = Farbs = Some, called \\"farbs\\" or \\"polyester soldiers\\"Hadden, Robert Lee. \\"Reliving the Civil War: A reenactor's handbook\\". Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1999. p 209 and p 219 are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. A \\"good enough\\" attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. The origin of the word \\"farb\\" (and the derivative adjective \\"farby\\") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961.Hadden p 8 Ross M. Kimmel states that it was used at the Manassas reenactment in 1961... George Gorman and his 2nd North Carolina picked up the term at the First Manassas Reenactment in 1961 and enjoyed using it constantly with condescension and sarcasm directed toward other units. Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of \\"far be it from authentic.\\" An alternative definition is \\"far be it for me to question/criticise\\",Hadden, p 8 or \\"fast and researchless buying\\".Hadden p 8 Juanita Leisch calls it \\"Fast And Researchless Buying,\\" and other sources insist it came from the Bicentennial and Revolutionary War groups and means \\"Fairly Authentic Royal British.\\" Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German farbe, color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined,Hadden p8 or the German farbische, manufactured, indicating obviously modern items. According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of \\"The Black Hats, CSA\\" reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since.Hadden, p 219-220 Many of the early replica rifles were marked with what looked like \\"F.A.R.B\\" among the proofmarks. Removal of this mark is the origin of the term \\"defarb\\". Many of the early Italian replica rifles were marked with what looked like \\"F.A.R.B\\" among the proofmarks. Removal of this would be to defarb, and the term came to cover other objects. =Mainstream= Another group of reenactors often is called \\"Mainstream\\". These reenactors are somewhere between farb and authentic. They are more common than either farbs or authentics. Most mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the time-period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items, such as air mattresses and sleeping bags, are sometimes used \\"after hours\\" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see. =Progressive= The Liberty Guards Mess, a group of hardcore reenactors, in a Sherman's bummers portrayal. At the other extreme from farbs are \\"hard-core authentics\\" or \\"progressives,\\" as they prefer to be called,Hadden p 138 sometimes derisively called \\"stitch counters\\".Hadden p 224 Hard-cores generally seek an \\"immersive\\" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of their chosen time period might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.Hadden p 138 \\"Like soldiers of the Civil War, progressives experience the same poor conditions that the original soldiers did, camping without tents and sleeping out exposed to the cold and rain. They spend weekends eating bad and insufficient food, and they practice a steady regimen of work, marching, and drill. They suffer the cold, carrying insufficient clothing and blankets as well as sleeping campaign-style by spooning with each other for warmth.\\" Hard- core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate \\"reenactorisms\\".  Historical persona  To make their equipment authentic, a reenactor must first decide on the time period, geographic location, and social status they wish to portray. The collection of clothing and equipment is typically called a \\"kit\\" and the fictional alter ego is called a \\"persona\\". Sometimes when a person has interests that a single persona can't reasonably encompass, for the sake of being authentic, they might create more than one persona. For example, someone might be interested in Norse (\\"Viking\\") cultures but also be interested in economics and social history that led to the Landsknecht, and might create two separate personae and kits. They can then choose the persona they will portray according to which hobby they want to do, the location of the reenactment, or the weather (cultures that wore a lot of wool and fur are more popular to reenact in winter than summer).  Authenticity  Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer Leipzig 1970; reenactment of Native Americans was quite popular in communist Eastern Germany Since authenticity of certain equipment vary between periods and regions, it can be difficult to ensure an entire set or kit of clothing and gear is authentic for a particular historical persona. Most organized societies have recognized norms for kit and garb for their historic and regional specialty. A key philosophy is to research items in advance, vs. buying things and then trying to \\"fit them in\\" to the time and place being reenacted. For example, the Vikings are not known to have used plate armour, but some would try to justify it because the earlier Roman Army did. A person might try to pass off an interesting Polish hat by claiming their French persona had traveled to Poland. Such tactics serve to confuse an uneducated audience, however, since many will simply assume that if everyone is portraying Vikings, French pikemen, Prussians grenadiers, etc. that they are also wearing and using items common to that era and people. Authenticity can apply to other things. For example, a card game, song, or military tactic is authentic if known to be used during the period. The quest for authentic clothes and equipment often requires archaeological evidence, archival research, and other historical sources that reveal what was used at the time. A reenactor may become an amateur historian (or even a professional historian) in pursuit of evidence and sources to create an accurate persona. Many time periods of reenactment have online discussion boards where reenactors and historians discuss the merits of various items, how to make them, or where to purchase them. Several factors commonly limit the attainable level of authenticity. These include: * Safety considerations * Climate/weather * Available information * Cost in money and/or time The German approach of authenticity (reenactment) is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain era. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities.Benita Luckmann: Bretten, Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Enke, Stuttgart 1970, . Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but as mere staffage for the immersion experience.Michael Petzet: \\"ln the full richness of their authenticity\\" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.  Enforcement  The strictness with which authenticity is enforced varies widely with different events and groups. While some consider only documented historical use to be authentic, and ban all inauthentic gear and behaviour from reenactment activities, others permit materials that plausibly could have existed, others permit inauthentic materials that can't be seen by the public, and still others only require that \\"it has to look authentic from 10 meters away\\" (i.e. from a distant audience's perspective). Similarly, many groups permit equipment combined from a wider range of centuries than what could be considered historically accurate (e.g. 12th century soldiers wearing barbute helmets). This sometimes results from safety rules that require protective gauntlets and helmets, even when this interferes with historical accuracy. In addition to mixing multiple centuries of a general period in a single event (usually to ensure a larger number of participants), some events feature more than a single period, especially if the event strongly focuses on combat displays or battles. In such cases, it is not unusual that the same reenactor participates in more than one show, sometimes with only slightly altered gear (depending on how strictly authenticity is enforced). A typical example is a clankie (a reenactor in full plate armour) removing his armour, picking up a round shield and participating in a Dark Age battle. Many groups, especially in medieval reenactment, heavily promote the use of \\"market speech\\", i.e., talking in a way that sounds appropriate for the period. Inauthentic equipment and behaviour is often referred to via descriptive phrases like \\"pocket dragon\\" (for a lighter or box of matches) and \\"horseless carriage\\" (for a car or other engine-powered vehicle) to circumvent strict enforcement of authentic speech. Other groups expect reenactors to stay fully in-character throughout an event, and refrain from commenting on non-period items. To adequately explain activities to an audience, many such groups designate one or two people as \\"interpreters\\" who can step out of character to discuss things from a modern perspective. Other ways to circumvent the need for authentic equipment include \\"hiding\\" plastic bottles (usually by wrapping them in cloths or furs), using \\"bindings\\" (long straps of cloth or fur) to make inauthentic footgear look more adequate, or simply hiding coolboxes inside wooden chests. For safety and comfort, authenticity is usually restricted to designated public areas, thus allowing for the use of portable toilets and inauthentic tenting by reenactors outside these areas. A typical issue among strictly authentic reenactors is the inclusion of female combatants, as this is a clash between authenticity (there were no female combatants in most reenacted periods) and modern concepts of sexual equality.See, for example, the discussions by American Civil War reenactors at and . Similarly, some groups enforce authentic hairstyles (e.g., 20th century soldiers are usually not expected to wear long hair or beards) and often (inauthentic) jewelry is not permitted ‚Äî although in combat reenactment this is often more of a safety issue than a question of authenticity.

The band's music blended 1980s dub and reggae with 1990s punk and indie rock. The band's members included Ben Brewer on lead guitar and vocals, and Gunnar Olsen on drums. Jeff DaRosa was formerly the band's lead vocals and bass player. History Ben Brewer, a.k.a. Benjamin Bronfman, son of billionaire Edgar Bronfman Jr., met Olsen in high school. The two have played in several bands together. One of these bands turned into an early incarnation of The Exit. In 2000 Brewer met Jeff DaRosa while attending Emerson College in Boston. DaRosa grew up in Watertown, Massachusetts and was the bassist of the local punk band The Vigilantes. Brewer convinced DaRosa to join the group, and they started practicing in basements around Boston. The band made a demo tape which made its way into the hands of Daniel Rey known for his work with The Ramones. Rey produces the band's first record, New Beat, which came out on Some Records, a label started by Walter Schreifels. The band started touring in early 2001, booking their own shows. New Beat received favorable reviews, Aversion review of New Beat many of which likened the band to The Clash, The Police and U2. The artwork was done by Damian Genuardi of the Explosion. The Exit then entered the studio with producer Ron Saint Germain (Bad Brains, Tool, Sonic Youth) to produce a follow up, Home For An Island. The album featured Brewer singing lead for the first time, tribal rhythms, dubbed out guitars, and psychedelic bridges. The album was a political response to life in post-9/11 New York City. Songs include \\"Soldier,\\" \\"Home For an Island,\\" \\"Let's Go to Haiti\\" and \\"Back to the Rebels.\\" The album was originally released in 2004 on Some Records, but in 2005 The Exit signed to Wind-Up Records and re-released Home for an Island, adding three new songs \\"Sun Will Rise in Queens,\\" \\"Pressure Cooker\\" and \\"Warm Summer Days.\\" Reviews were good.Press Clips at Some Records The Exit supported Muse on two different US tours. On August 15, 2006, through a post on their MySpace blog, the band announced the departure of Jeff DaRosa. Olsen and Brewer noted the band will continue with a yet-to-be-announced lineup.

This is the first album recorded by the band with new bass guitar player Tracy Ferrie. Reborn was released with a variety of cover art, depending on format and region. The alternate US cover art was created for record outlets (such as Christian bookstores) where the original cover art may have been perceived as too disturbing or offensive. Reborn became a rare collectors' item instantly, since the first copies of the album have a technical mistake; songs 7-9 are played in the album in a different order than the one stated on the cover artwork. Big 3 Records plans to re-release the album with the correct order of songs. \\"I.G.W.T.\\" is a contemporary remake of the band's previous hit \\"In God We Trust\\" from the album of the same name.

Vatakara is located between Kannur and Kozhikode. The municipality of Vatakara covers an area of 23.33 km2 and is bordered by Mah√© to the north and Payyoli to the south. It is the headquarters of Vatakara taluk, which consists of 22 panchayats. During the reign of the Kolathiris and Zamorins, Vatakara was known as Kadathanadu. During the British Raj, it was part of the North Malabar region of Malabar District in the state of Madras. The historic Lokanarkavu temple, made famous by the Vadakkan Pattukal (ballads of North Malabar), is situated in Vatakara. Geography Jetty on the Moorad river Vatakara is located at and has an average elevation of . It is situated about 49 km to the north of Kozhikode City, approximately 44 km to the south of Kannur City, and adjacent to Mah√©. The town lies by the side of a river variously called the Moorad river, the Kuttiady river, or Kottakkal river. The town's position relative to this river led to it being called Vadakkekara (north bank), later contracted to Vatakara. Towards the east, near the panchayats of Nadapuram and Kuttiady, Vadakara borders the Wayanad district along the Western Ghats section. In the west, like many of the towns in Kerala, Vatakara is flanked by the Arabian Sea. The Kuttiyadi river meets the sea to the south of Vatakara, forming small islands and sandbars near the river mouth. History Vatakara was the capital of the historical region called Kurumba Nadu, home of the Kurumbar people. In the pre-British era, a major part of the current Vatakara taluk, including the area currently constituting the Vatakara municipality, was ruled by a chieftain as a feudatory to the Kolathiri kingdom. The remaining part of the taluk was initially part of the Polathiri kingdom and later ruled by the Zamorins of Calicut. The boundary between these kingdoms is believed to have been in the region in Vatakara known as Puduppanam, with the Moorad river forming a geographical boundary. The Kadathanad dynasty was established when a Polathiri royal was forced to cross over to Kolathunadu after an unsuccessful battle with the Zamorins, settled in the region, and married a Kolathiri princess. A town leader before the government took over, Bala Kurup, still has documented descendants in Vatakara. Vatakara became an important trade center in the region by the early 18th century, exporting agricultural products such as coffee, pepper and coconut. Together with smaller nearby ports at Chombal, Muttungal and Kottakkal, Badagara became one of the major centers of trade at a level with those at Cannanore, Tellicherri and Calicut. Building on a thriving economy led by a strong sea trade, the Kadathanad rulers established a strong naval force which became known as the \\"Lord of the Seas\\", since it was the strongest naval force from the Malayalam-speaking region. A significant factor in the rise of Vatakara as a trade center was the rise and subsequent fall of the Kunjali Marakkars of Kottakkal. During the 16th century CE, Kunjali Marakkars were the admirals of the Zamorin's naval fleet and were famous for their valor and sea battle tactics. The Marakkars established their stronghold in Kottakkal and built a fort there. The last Marakkar, Kunjali IV, was defeated at the beginning of the 17th century by the combined forces of the Zamorin, with whom he had fallen out, and the Portuguese, who resented the interference of Kunjali and his followers in their trade route. The fort was completely destroyed by a bombardment from the sea. However, the Marakkars' knowledge of ship handling and tactics continued to be passed down in the community of seafarers in this area of Vatakara, later allowing the ruler of Kadathanad to establish his supremacy in the sea and to enforce a 'pass' system for trade ships. The region became a separate kingdom around 1750, when the then chieftain took the title of Kadathanad Rajah. During this period, there are records of frequent skirmishes between Kadathanad and the ruler of Kottayam as well as the foreign colonial powers of the British, based in Thalassery, and the French, based in Mah√©. In legend, Vatakara is the birthplace of Unniyarcha, Aromal Chekavar, and Thacholi Othenan, the heroes of the Vadakkanpattu (ballads of North Malabar). The Thacholi family home, Thacholi Tharavadu, is still preserved and the anniversary of Thacholi Othenan's birth is celebrated in the Thacholi Manikkothu Kavu temple. Notable temples in the area include Lokanarkavu and Kottakkal Bhagavathi Temple, the second richest temple in North Malabar. Kalari Ullathil Temple is also situated near Vatakara town.The martial art Kalaripayattu originated in Vatakara. Demographics Most of Vatakara's inhabitants are labourers and farmers, while some are government employees. A large number of expatriates from Vatakara work in Middle Eastern countries, and their remittances have a strong influence on the local economy. Some emigrants work in nearby states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. As of the 2011 Census of India, Vatakara had a population of 75,740, with males constituting 48% of the population and females 52%. Vatakara has an average literacy rate of 83%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 80%. 11% of the population was under 6 years old. Economy Fishing is one of Vatakara's main commercial activities. The Moorad River flows into the Arabian Sea at a point close to the town. Vatakara is organized around two commercial hubs, the old and new bus depots. The area around the old bus depot contains commercial establishments as old as 100 years. Recently, commerce has shifted to the area around the new bus depot and the road towards Kannur, with many new buildings, including hospitals and flats being built or planned. Nut Street is the distribution center for nuts, including coconuts and areca nuts. Produce flows to collection outlets and is dried, packed, and transported to other states. Northern Kerala is well known for the production of coconuts. Hospitals include the CO-OP Hospital, Asha Hospital, Janatha Hospital, Ceeyam Hospital and the Parco specialty hospital. The Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society is a unique labour cooperative initiative centered in Madappally that was inspired by the Indian sage Vagbhatananda. The society was registered in 1925.

In the United States, the most significant attempt to amend the United States Constitution by inserting explicitly Christian ideas and language began during the American Civil War and was spearheaded by the National Reform Association.  Samoa  In June 2017, Samoa became a Christian state, after Parliament passed a bill to amend its constitution; Article 1 of the Samoan Constitution states that ‚ÄúSamoa is a Christian nation founded of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit‚Äù.  United States = Initial proposals = In February 1863, during the American Civil War, a coalition of eleven Protestant denominations from seven northern states gathered to discuss the state of the nation. Seeing the Civil War as God's punishment for the omission of God from the Constitution, they discussed a proposed amendment to alter the wording of the Preamble to acknowledge God. The idea that civil governments derive their legitimacy from God, and Jesus in particular, was alleged to be based on Biblical passages such as Psalm 2 and Romans 13. The original draft of the amendment, by Pennsylvania attorney John Alexander, read:The NRA (National Reform Association) and the Christian Amendment, by Jim Allison The Christian Amendment Movement was founded the next year and quickly renamed the \\"National Reform Association\\" with Alexander as its first president. They sent a memorial to Congress formally proposing the following amendment: A delegation from the National Reform Association sought to meet with Abraham Lincoln on February 11, 1864, to solicit his endorsement of the amendment. Lincoln's pastor, Rev. Phineas Gurley, arranged for Lincoln to meet the delegation.\\"Origin and Progress of the Movement to Secure the Religious Amendment of the Constitution of the United States\\", by T. P. Stevenson. Proceedings of the National Convention to Secure the Religious Amendment of the Constitution of the United States (1872), pp. viii, x. After hearing their petition, Lincoln responded: The proposal was supported by Senators Charles Sumner, B. Gratz Brown and John Sherman, but did not come to a vote in Congress. One member of the National Reform Association, James Pollock, played a role in getting the phrase \\"In God We Trust\\" on the two-cent coin in 1864. Another version of the amendment read:A Letter to James Dobson , by William Gould, The Christian Statesman, September‚ÄìOctober 1996. Similar proposals were considered by Congress in 1874, 1895, 1896, 1910, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, and 1969 but none passed. = Later attempts = With the growing backlash in American society against communism in the 1940s and 1950s, new efforts were made to introduce Christianity into the Constitution, although these efforts were now in the form of standard constitutional amendments. In 1954 Vermont Senator Ralph Flanders proposed:Staff writers, \\"Hunting Time,\\"Time, May 24, 1954 : Section 1: This nation devoutly recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ, Savior and Ruler of nations, through whom are bestowed the blessings of Almighty God. : Section 2: This amendment shall not be interpreted so as to result in the establishment of any particular ecclesiastical organization, or in the abridgment of the rights of religious freedom, or freedom of speech and press, or of peaceful assemblage. : Section 3: Congress shall have power, in such cases as it may deem proper, to provide a suitable oath or affirmation for citizens whose religious scruples prevent them from giving unqualified allegiance to the Constitution as herein amended. None of the proposals came to a Congressional vote. There were calls for similar amendments in the wake of the 1962 Supreme Court case Engel v. Vitale, which ruled school-sponsored and dictated prayer in schools unconstitutional. Over 200 similar amendment proposals were introduced to Congress between 1894 and 1984.

Early years Abizaid was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to an American mother and a Mexican/Lebanese father. She traveled the Middle East and Europe with her family before the age of ten, when she moved with her mother and brother to the United States. Along with her four sisters, she formed a band and developed a talent for harmonies. Her first exposure to music was Middle Eastern music combined with the late 1970s American influences of Alice Cooper, Elton John, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and The Beatles. After moving to the U.S., she lived in Poughkeepsie, New York until moving to Great Falls, Virginia for high school. She later attended the Corcoran School of Art in Georgetown and then transferred to the Catholic University of America to study drama and music, while pursuing a career in hairstyling. She dropped out of college to work as a runway model with designers such as Jacques Fath, Nina Ricci, Oscar de la Renta, Alberta Ferretti, Badgley Mischka, Chlo√©, and Bill Blass. She traveled to Paris and Germany and modeled for London designer Zandra Rhodes in the UK. Afterward, she returned to the U.S. to live in Miami, Florida. In Miami, she met musician/songwriter Shane Soloski in the late 1990s and decided to move to Los Angeles to form a band with him. Their first gig was an open mic at Molly Malone's where she met and played with Todd Sucherman (drummer for Styx). After several open mics around Los Angeles, she and Soloski formed a band called Blue which included musicians Eric Dover (guitarist for Alice Cooper), Ron Dziubla (guitarist/saxophonist for Ricky Martin), Brian Head (drummer for Foreigner), Mike Mennell (bassist for Tom Jones), and Taylor Mills (singer for Brian Wilson). They played a series of shows in Los Angeles at The Gig and The Mint and broke up in 2001 just before releasing their first album. She then recorded and performed as a backup vocalist for Jennifer Stills and as a backup vocalist for Kathleen Bird York (known for her Oscar-nominated song \\"In the Deep\\" from Crash). Abizaid began recording vocal sessions for several TV shows with writers Stephen Phillips and Tim P. from Bosshouse Music, as well as two songs for the film Devious Beings in 2002, starring Patrick Van Horn and Kevin Connolly. She was also the voice for Ally Sheedy and Charisma Carpenter on the TV show Strange Frequency starring Roger Daltrey in 2001, singing a vocal recorded duet with Sebastian Bach from the band Skid Row. Due to the success of Paramount's The 4400, The New York Post author Adam Buckman wrote on August 28, 2005, \\"I'd like to thank two singers ‚Äî one named Sia and the other named Amanda Abizaid ‚Äî for making TV all the more memorable this summer.\\" Solo years Now an established artist in Los Angeles, Abizaid has performed as a solo artist releasing a single, two EPs, and one LP working with musicians Eric Dover, Ron Dziubla, Mike Mennell, Thom Gimbel (keyboardist/saxophonist for Foreigner), Brian Head, and Brian Tichy (drummer for Ozzy Osbourne). Abizaid has played shows around the Los Angeles area at The Gig, The Mint, The Rainbow, Genghis Cohen, Tangier, The Derby, and other acoustic venues.

Its history dates back to the medieval Archbishopric of Magdeburg established in 968 AD. History At the 967 synod of Ravenna, Emperor Otto I obtained the consent of Pope John XIII to elevate Magdeburg to the see of an archbishop. The next year, against the valiant resistance by the Archbishop of Mainz and the Halberstadt bishop, Otto created the new archbishopric dedicated to Saint Maurice. It then headed an ecclesiastical province comprising the dioceses of Brandenburg, Havelberg, Zeitz, Merseburg, and Meissen, all located in the Saxon Eastern March. The first metropolitan was Archbishop Adalbert of Magdeburg (c. 910 - 981), a missionary to the Polabian Slavs, who also held the title of Primas Germaniae. From the 12th century onwards, the Magdeburg metropolitans ruled as prince- archbishops over extended territories along the Elbe river. From 1207 onwards, Archbishop Albert had Magdeburg Cathedral rebuilt in a Gothic style that reflected his power position among the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. At the beginning of the modern era, Magdeburg had to cope with the claims of the neighbouring Saxon and Brandenburg electorates. In 1476 Ernst II of Saxony, son of the Wettin elector Ernest, was elected archbishop; he occupied the city of Halle, where he had the Moritzburg residence erected between 1484 and 1503. During the Protestant Reformation, large parts of the population within the prince-archbishopric turned Lutheran and from 1566 Magdeburg was ruled by a diocesan administrator. The estates were devastated in the Thirty Years' War. According to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the archiepiscopal territories were to be secularised and adjudicated to the Hohenzollern electors of Brandenburg. These provisions were implemented upon the death of the last administrator Duke Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1680, whereafter the secular Duchy of Magdeburg passed under the rule of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg. From 1670 the former Catholic archdiocese was under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany. After the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the territories, now part of the Prussian Province of Saxony, were administrated by the Archbishops of Paderborn. The Magdeburg provosts at St. Sebastian's Church were also appointed episcopal commissioners. The Catholic church structure persisted even after the division of Germany from 1949 when Magdeburg, then part of East Germany, remained the see of auxiliary bishops sent from Paderborn in West Germany. In 1973 Bishop Johannes Braun was appointed Apostolic Administrator, who, though officially still subordinated to Paderborn, ruled over Magdeburg as a de facto diocese. After German reunification, Braun's successor Leo Nowak was elevated to a bishop according to an Apostolic constitution issued on 27 June 1994 by Pope John Paul II. Magdeburg thereby was separated from Paderborn and restored as an autonomous suffragan diocese of the ecclesiastical province, dedicated to Saint Norbert of Xanten, with Saints Maurice and Gertrude of Helfta as secondary patrons.

It is located in H√§meenlinna, the city between Helsinki and Tampere. Originally located on an island, the castle now sits on the coast of lake Vanajavesi. The castle consists of a central keep and surrounding curtain walls, enclosed by a moat. The keep originally had five turrets, but only two are apparent today. The curtain wall has a gatehouse, battlements, an octagonal brick corner turret, and a round gun turret. The lower tiers of the keep and curtain wall are of masoned granite and the upper tiers are red brickwork. Although the exact date is disputed, the castle is generally considered to have been constructed in the 13th century. In addition to its status as a military fortress and home for Swedish nobility, the castle has seen use as a prison, and is currently a museum operated by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. The castle is one of the main tourist attractions of southern Finland, being the centerpiece of the city and a popular venue for events, including renaissance fairs. History The castle's age is disputed. Traditionally, the construction of the castle has been connected to Birger Jarl's Second Swedish Crusade, which would date the castle in the mid-13th century. However, there are no archeological finds from the castle that can be firmly dated to a period earlier than the 1320s. An earlier fortification from the early 1300s only some away in Hakoinen also contests Tavastia Castle's age, as only one castle (\\"Tauestahus\\") is listed in Tavastia in a royal document from 1308.. In Latin. Hosted by the National Board of Antiquities. Also, the Russian Novgorod First Chronicle only mentions one castle during their plundering of Tavastia in 1311, its description also matching with the castle in Hakoinen.Novgorod Chronicle . English translation. Tavastia Castle at the end of the 1650s In the mid-1500s, under Gustav I, the castle lost much of its military importance. Some restoration was conducted in the early 1600s, and in 1639, the castle's nearby settlements gained official city status as H√§meenlinna. The castle continued to be neglected by Swedish rule throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, as its military interests shifted to the southern Baltic sea. Tavastia Castle was briefly ceded to the Russian army during the Great Northern War, after which the castle's defensive systems were upgraded with bastions. Painted by Hjalmar Munsterhjelm in 1872 After the Finnish War, when Finland became the Grand Duchy of Finland under Russian rule, the castle was turned into a prison. It served as such until 1953, when massive restoration work started. The castle has been a public museum since 1979, the facilities of which can also be rented for private events.

In 1984, Continental Illinois became the largest ever bank failure in U.S. history, when a run on the bank led to its seizure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Continental Illinois retained this dubious distinction until the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 during the financial crisis of 2008, which ended up being over seven times larger than the failure of Continental Illinois.  History =Early history= neo-classical Continental Illinois Bank Building at 231 South LaSalle Street in Chicago, Illinois Continental Illinois can be traced back to two Chicago banks, the Commercial National Bank, founded during the American Civil War, and the Continental National Bank, founded in 1883. In 1910, the two banks merged to form the Continental & Commercial National Bank of Chicago with $175 million in deposits ‚Äì a large bank at the time. In 1932 the name was changed to the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.Wilson, Mark R. \\"Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.\\" in Porter, Stephen R. & Reiff, Janice L. eds. (2004-05). Encyclopedia of Chicago. Chicago: Chicago Historical Society/Newberry Library, University of Chicago Press. . Accessed 2009-10-28. =Insolvency= In May 1984,Gorner, Peter. \\"Bank Deal Tied To Pope's Death?\\" Ottawa Citizen (June 12, 1984) Continental Illinois became insolvent due, in part, to bad loans purchased from the failed Penn Square Bank N.A. of Oklahoma‚Äîloans for oil and gas producers and service companies and investors in the Oklahoma and Texas oil and gas boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Due diligence was not properly conducted by John Lytle, an executive in the Mid-Continent Division of oil lending, and other leading officers of the bank. Lytle later pleaded guilty to a count of defrauding Continental of $2.25 million and receiving $585,000 in kickbacks for approving risky loan applications. Lytle was sentenced to three and a half years in a federal prison. The Penn Square failure eventually caused a substantial run on the bank's deposits once it became clear Continental Illinois was headed for failure. Large depositors withdrew over $10 billion of deposits in early May 1984.Some of this is detailed in the books Funny Money by Mark Singer (New York: Knopf, 1985, ) and Belly Up: The Collapse of the Penn Square Bank by Philip Zweig (New York: Crown, 1985, ). In addition, the bank was destabilized by massive losses from an options firm it had just acquired, First Options Chicago (FOC), a leading clearinghouse operation. FOC guaranteed that trades will settle, but found during the market's crash in October 1987 that many customers could not meet their margin calls, forcing FOC to step in to settle with cash or the underlying securities to complete the trade. This meant Continental absorbed massive risks on behalf of FOC customers, in the period leading up to a major stock market crash. Nassim Nicholas Taleb summarized the practice \\"...(FOC) were so incompetent... they netted exposure by traders, not realizing that the (sic) trader that goes bust, the trader making money isn't going to write (FOC) a check\\".Interview \\"Nassim Taleb on Black Monday, Fed, Market Lessons\\" .Bloomberg TV (October 26, 2017) Ultimately, this meant that Continental Illinois had to infuse $625M in emergency cash to keep its $135M FOC investment afloat.Archive \\"Losses at options unit hurt Continental Illinois?\\" The New York Times (October 20, 1987) The FOC crisis, and the extent to which it may have jeopardized Continental Illinois; the banking system; and the financial markets as a whole, was the subject of a hearing by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), in 1988.Atlas, Terry \\"1st Options\` Loss Was $112 Million\\". Chicago Tribune (October 20, 1987) =FDIC rescue= Due to Continental Illinois' size, regulators were not willing to let it fail. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) feared a failure could cause widespread financial trouble and instability. To avert this, regulators prevented the loss of virtually all deposit accounts and even bondholders. The FDIC infused $4.5 billion to rescue the bank. According to Daniel Yergin in The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power (1991), \\"The Federal Government intervened, with a huge bail- out‚Äî$5.5 billion of new capital, $8 billion in emergency loans, and, of course, new management.\\"Yergin, Daniel. The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991. . p. 732. A willing merger partner had been sought for two months but could not be found. Eventually, the board of directors and top management were removed. Bank shareholders were substantially wiped out, although holding-company bondholders were protected. Until the seizure of Washington Mutual in 2008, the bailout of Continental Illinois under Ronald Reagan was the largest bank failure in American history. The term \\"too big to fail\\" was popularized by Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the FDIC's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press. =Emergence from FDIC majority ownership= Continental Illinois was renamed Continental Bank. It continued to exist, with the federal government effectively owning 80% of the company's shares and having the right to obtain the remainder (ultimately exercised in 1989) if losses in the rescue exceeded certain thresholds. The federal government gradually disposed of its ownership interests in Continental Bank, completing the process on June 6, 1991. In 1994, Continental Bank was acquired by BankAmerica in order to broaden the latter's midwestern presence. In 2007, successor bank firm Bank of America has a retail branch and hundreds of back-office employees at Continental's former headquarters on South LaSalle Street in Chicago. Bank of America operates dozens of retail branches in the Chicago area and purchased LaSalle Bank in 2007 to expand its Chicago business and several lines of corporate and investment banking business. In 1984 the Town and Country Mastercard, issued by Continental Illinois Bank, assets were sold to Chemical Bank of New York including the remote credit card servicing centers in Hoffman Estates and Matteson Illinois. After moving the credit card staff out of the Continental facility, the operations were reopened at a new facility and rebranded Chem Credit Services later in 1984. Continental Illinois Venture Corporation, an investment subsidiary of the bank, formed a semi-independent private equity firm, CIVC Partners, with backing from Bank of America. =Silver dollar holdings= Part of the bank's required reserves were held in silver dollars, which provided the opportunity to profit from a rise in silver prices. The holdings, estimated to be 1.5 million silver dollars, was sold to a coin dealer to raise money in the early 1980s.Professional Coin Grading Service See paragraph \\"The Continental-Illinois Bank Hoard\\"Highfill, John W.

The College was named after the Forest of Bowland, to the east of Lancaster. Members of the College are informally referred to as Bowlanders. History Bowland was founded alongside Lonsdale College as the first two colleges of the University in 1964. The Bowland and Lonsdale buildings were built as mirror images of each other, but Lonsdale's building was not completed until a year after Bowland's, making Bowland the oldest college on campus. After Lonsdale's move to south-west campus in 2004, the original Lonsdale building was taken over by Bowland and is today known as \\"Bowland North\\". Since 2004 the two colleges have competed in the annual Founders Series, consisting of nineteen sports contested over four days. Symbols The lady in the College logo, The Bowland Lady, represents the personification of Bowland Forest, and is from a Lancashire map drawn by William Hole for the 1622 edition of a poem \\"Poly-Olbion, or a Chorographical Description of ... The Renowned Isle of Great Britain\\", the lifetime's work of Michael Drayton, a friend of Shakespeare. The poem is in the University Library; a copy of the map is in the College bar. The college magazine is also named after \\"The Bowland Lady\\". The Forest of Bowland was originally called \\"Bolland\\" and this pronunciation remains common amongst local people living in the forest. The JCR motto is Bowland Til I Die. College Buildings Bowland College Quad The College has 641 study bedrooms overall, over two-fifths of which are en-suite. The standard residences in Bowland Main and Bowland North, along the North Spine, accommodate sociable kitchens shared between 16 and 26 people, and are situated around the College's main quadrangles. In contrast, Bowland Hall offers en-suite residences in a tranquil location by the tree- lined perimeter road; just four students share each flat. Until 1995 the College occupied its main building, centred on its main quad, Bowland Tower and also Bowland Annexe which consisted of two wings overlooking Alexandra Square. In 1995 Slaidburn House was completed providing extra accommodation for the College to the south of Alexandra Square. In 2004 the College named its main building Bowland Main and took over the space to its immediate north, which had been vacated by Lonsdale College. This was renamed Bowland North. In the same year the College gained the upper floors of Assistant Staff House and Graduate Hall, which was renamed Bowland Hall. Bowland Main Quad Bowland Annexe was renamed Bowland Tower East and Bowland Tower North; the College also acquired the Art Department building, which was subsequently renamed Bowland Annexe. Bowland Annexe has 35 rooms on C floor, with two kitchens, one female bathroom and one male bathroom to share among the residents. There are three shower spaces and three toilets in the female bathroom. Heater is present in all the rooms and in the bathrooms. There are approximately seven fire doors on the floor in the hallway and a fire drill takes place once a week. Residents with rooms overlooking Lancaster Square and Country Main can also enjoy the wind turbine view from their rooms. The ground floor and first floor of Bowland Annexe belongs to the Arts Department, chemical smells should be expected upon entering the entrance. There is only one elevator that goes to the first floor, individuals should be prepared to move their luggage and belongings up the stairs. The third floor, also known as C floor, and the fourth floor, known as D floor are the main residency area. Each room has their own washing basins. Parts of this estate were lent to other Colleges during building projects, but Bowland regained Slaidburn House in 2007, which is the accommodation above the campus Spar. Bowland Tower will be officially opened during Lent Term, January 2014 to students who now reside in Ash House. Bowland Bar, known as the \\"Trough Of Bowland\\" and Bowland Main received makeovers in October 2011 and are now fully modernised, in keeping with most of the accommodation and bars on campus. GallerySport Bowland College regularly competes in weekly inter-collegiate sports against the other 8 colleges of Lancaster University. This comes in the form of their 4 men's football teams, 4 lady's netball teams and various bar sports including table tennis, pool and darts. Bowland College won the inter-college trophy, the Carter Shield, in 2006, 2007, 2008 and more recently in 2016. It is also the overall winner of the Founders Trophy, an annual competition between Bowland and Lonsdale, the two founding colleges of Lancaster University. The competition usually takes place during the final term of the academic year, over a four day period. The two colleges compete in various sports including conventional college sports and also sports not usually competed by colleges such as, hockey, basketball, cricket, etc. Bowland has dominated the Founders Trophy since its conception; however, in recent years Lonsdale have found more success in the competition, closing the gap in terms of overall victories. Bowland College has continued to be a main competitor in the Carter Shield and George Wyatt Trophy, in inter-collegiate sports. Each year, Bowland College takes part in an Intercollegiate quiz along with the other nine colleges at Lancaster University, inspired by University Challenge. http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/bowland/college-life/events--activities/ In 2018, Bowland College made it through to the final, along with Cartmel College and subsequently won scoring 195-95. https://www.facebook.com/events/1789427474687179/ Governance= Syndicate = The University Statutes require the College Syndicate to be formally responsible for the strategic governance of the College. The Syndicate is chaired by the College Principal. Membership comprises all senior members of the College plus the current JCR Executive Officers. An additional 10 junior members may be appointed at the discretion of the Syndicate. Meeting at least once a year, the Syndicate has overall responsibility for the strategic development and governance of the College, including the welfare of the student members and disciplinary matters. It may also discuss general matters relating to Colleges and the University as they arise, and report College views to University Senate, the governing academic body of the University. = College Management Committee = In practice, most decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the College are discussed and determined at Management Committee meetings. The Management Committee reports to the Syndicate. Membership consists of several senior officers, plus the JCR President and Vice-President. = JCR Executive = The Junior Common Room Executive, a standing committee of the Students' Union, consists of 15 students and is elected by the undergraduate population of the college. The JCR Exec exists to represent students' views, organise socials and campaigns and provide opportunities for students to get involved in events and activities taking place in the College. The precise structure of JCR Executives varies between Lancaster's colleges, but Bowland is unique in having one Vice-President where most colleges have two, and in being the only college with an equality officer. In addition, members of the Executive are officially titled \\"representatives\\" rather than \\"officers\\" (though the two are commonly used interchangeably). Endowments There is a Management Board which oversees the financial management and expenditure of funds received from benefactors: The Bowland College Trust Fund. The Board reports directly to Syndicate.

An unofficial region, Brewerytown runs approximately between the Schuylkill River's eastern bank and 25th Street, bounded by Cecil B. Moore Avenue to the north and Parrish Street to the south. Brewerytown got its name because of the numerous breweries that were located along the Schuylkill during the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is now primarily a residential neighborhood, with a growing and active commercial sector along Girard Avenue. History The earliest indications of this legacy can be seen on maps from the 1860s, which list several minor German brewers and distillation facilities in this region. Proximity to the river and nearby farmland allowed these establishments to flourish, and as demands increased, so did development in Brewerytown. By the early 20th century it was a thriving German settlement. Much of the expansion into the early 20th century was handled by architect Otto Wolf, who oversaw the construction of over 60 buildings in the area, bringing a distinct German texture to the houses, saloons, and breweries of the area. Some of his buildings are still standing, including the Bergdoll Brewing complex, and F.A. Poth Brewing. Jefferson Street Grounds, the first home of the Philadelphia Athletics major league baseball team and site of the first ever Major League Baseball game, is located at 27th and Jefferson Streets in the neighborhood. It was also home to famed Columbia Park. At its peak, 700 breweries operated across Philadelphia, several in a ten-block area of Brewerytown. Unfortunately, with the collapse of local industry later in the 20th century, originally started by the implementation of Prohibition in the United States, and beer production moving primarily to the Midwest, every single brewer had vanished by 1987. The industry has slowly returned to the city, but at nowhere near the capacity of its heyday. As of 2016, the only active brewery in Brewerytown is Crime & Punishment Brewing, which opened in 2015. During this late 20th-century slump, the entirety of North Philadelphia, Brewerytown included, was hit hard by economic depressions. Much of the area was deemed blighted by the city government. In 1991, the Brewerytown Historic District was certified by the National Register of Historic Places. The district contains 380 buildings and is roughly bounded by Cecil B Moore Ave., Pennsylvania Ave., 25th. and N. 33rd. =Breweries= City Park Brewery, listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places.

History = Higher-education initiatives in the 19th Century = The first plan for a public university in Ticino dates to the founding of the Canton, when in 1801 the Cantonal Diet decided for the establishment in Lugano of either a University or an Academy. The project of an Accademia Cantonale was further developed in the 1840s by Stefano Franscini. Although in 1844 the Grand Council approved with an overwhelming majority the bill to establish the institution, the Accademia was never established due to financial problems and more urgent issues with other sections of public education.Elio Ghirlanda, \\"Relazione sul Centro Universitario della Svizzera Italiana,\\" Scuola Ticinese, vol. XV, n¬∞ 128 (March 1986), p. 3-10 = The public debate in the 1970s and 1980s = Campaign poster in support of the Cantonal referendum on CUSI (April 18-19-20, 1986) quoting the words of Federal Councillor Stefano Franscini, who a century earlier (October 15, 1844) wrote about the importance of a higher education institution in the Canton Ticino. The immediate predecessor to the current USI was the project that began in 1970 for an institute of higher-education focused on post-graduate continuing education and based on Regional Science and on the Humanities titled Centro Universitario della Svizzera Italiana (CUSI). Carlo Speziali, then Councilor of State, was the main promoter of CUSI. However, although a bill about CUSI was passed by the Grand Council on 11 December 1985, a committee led by Augusto Bolla and UDC deputy Giovanni Maria Staffieri launched a referendum against it.Fabio Pontiggia, \\"I 20 anni dell'Universit√†,\\" Corriere del Ticino, 21 October 2016, p. 2-5 The committee formed in favor of CUSI drew on the earlier legacy of Franscini, to demonstrate the historical necessity of higher-education in Ticino. Despite the support that the project of CUSI had received by the Canton, on 20 April 1986 CUSI was turned down by the public vote: at a 41,5% turnout, voters rejected the bill with 47,011 votes, against 21,512 votes that went in favor of it. This controversial result was received by public institutions in Ticino as a threat to the hopes for the development of higher education outside of the German and French speaking regions. = Federal and cantonal initiatives of the 1990s = Following the defeat of CUSI, several new groups and institutions at different levels of government and civil society began formulating alternative proposals for a university based in Ticino. On 27 October 1990 Swiss Federal Councilor Flavio Cotti gave a speech in Poschiavo on multilingualism where he clearly supported the idea of a public university in the Italian-speaking Switzerland, this time however as a full-fledged institute of higher-education supported by a favorable economic growth.In his speech, Buffi reportedly said: \\"Le aumentate potenzialit√† economiche della Svizzera Italiana, il suo ruolo di ponte in particolare tra l'Italia e i Paesi nordici di lingua tedesca, rendono molto desiderabile e auspicabile il riesame del problema. Se lo studio dovesse essere ripreso la Confederazione non mancherebbe di accompagnarlo con tutta la sua benevolenza\\". In: Fabio Pontiggia, \\"I 20 anni dell'Universit√†,\\" Corriere del Ticino, 21 October 2016, p. 2 Cotti's speech echoed the manifesto that a group of politicians, scholars, and professionals published on 30 May 1990 on Libera Stampa, the newspaper of the Socialist Party. The group consisted of linguists Alessio Petralli and Stefano Vassere, economists Mauro Baranzini and Christian Marazzi, politician Rossano Bervini, Franco Cavalli, Mauro Martinoni, Silvano Toppi, Mauro Wolf. At the Cantonal level, the Ticino Government appointed architect and scholar Pier Giorgio Gerosa as delegate for university problems. In the spring of 1990, from this institutional position and in a period of ongoing debates about the presence of multilingualism in the Swiss Federal Constitution, Gerosa asked the Swiss University Conference to contemplate the possibility of an academic institution in Italian-speaking Switzerland. Furthermore, beginning in December 1991 Gerosa drafted a series of reports to demonstrate the case for a university with as many as four departments.Pier Giorgio Gerosa, \\"Analisi e Proposte per lo Sviluppo della Politica Universitaria Cantonale\\", Dipartimento della Pubblica Educazione della Repubblica e Cantone del Ticino, Bellinzona (1991) At the Federal level, in 1992 the ETH Board commissioned architect Mario Botta to draft a project for a national academy of architecture, which however would not be approved. In response to this rejection, Botta brought the project to the attention of the Ticino Government, which reviewed it positively in May 1993. Consequentially this event brought about friction between the Government and Pier Giorgio Gerosa, which led eventually to Gerosa's dismissal. Meanwhile, between 1992 and 1993 the Istituto Accademico di Teologia di Lugano was established under the support of Catholic Bishop Eugenio Corecco. Although private institutions of higher education were already present at that point in Ticino - one example of which was the English-speaking Franklin University Switzerland - the initiative of the Catholic Church would be recognized as the first contribution towards a university in Italian-speaking Switzerland. = The opening of USI on October 21st, 1996 = In the following years, the project for a university was further developed by dedicated parliamentary commissions. In 1994 a group of Mauro Baranzini, Sergio Cigada, and Lanfranco Senn drafted a project for the Departments of Economics and of Communication Sciences. In the same year the Council of State of the Canton Ticino approved dispatch n¬∞ 4308 pertaining the Bill for the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana, which in twelve articles outlined the structure of the future institution, to be built around the Accademia di Architettura and with the contribution of private financing. A pivotal role in building consensus for this bill was played by Counselor of State Giuseppe Buffi. On Tuesday 3 October 1995, at 19:11, the Grand Council of Ticino approved the bill that established USI, with seventy- three of eighty favorable votes. After twelve months of preparations, on 21 October 1996 USI opened its doors in Lugano and Mendrisio to the first class of students. Marco Baggiolini was appointed to serve as USI's first President. Mauro Dell'Ambrogio, who was the author of the bill, and who thus had previously played an important role on the side of Giuseppe Buffi - the Ticino Councilor of State at the head of the Dipartimento dell'Istruzione e della Cultura (Department of Education) - was appointed to serve as USI's first General Secretary. In 2000 USI granted its first degrees, concluding the first cycle of studies, thus meeting the acknowledgement of Federal authorities. In 2004 the Faculty of Informatics was established. In 2006, Marco Baggiolini was succeeded by Piero Martinoli. In 2014 the Government of the Canton Ticino approved the creation of the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences. In 2015, a new governance structure of USI was announced, with the position of President turned into a Rectorship. In 2016, Boas Erez was appointed Rector of USI, succeeding Piero Martinoli, and the new governance model was confirmed, including the appointment of two Pro-Rectors and the institution of an Academic Senate. In June 2020, USI was included in the 2021 QS World University Rankings for the first time ever. USI was ranked 273¬∞ in the world.  Campus and student life  The library The cafeteria The Lugano campus developed around the existing city hospital circa 1996. Several state-of-the- art buildings have been added, most notably Informatics (2007), Aula Magna, Aule, Library, and LAB. The main building consists of four floors containing: Communications and Economics offices (1-3), the Executive Centre, four computer labs (1), classrooms (1-3), the cafeteria (2)(Q1-2007), and third- floor auditorium (3)(Q3-2007). The library is four floors tall. The LAB has 5 floors, in great part occupied by the Institute of Computational Sciences, and the rest by other Communication Sciences and Informatics departments. Campus Map The \\"Aule\\" building, informally known as Palazzo Rosso (\\"Red Building\\"), hosts six classrooms on each of its three floors, and is commonly used for Economics and Communication Sciences courses. The modern-looking concrete and metal Informatics building finished in 2007 contains classrooms (1), offices and study areas reserved for CS students and mentors (2-3).View from the main buildingThe Aula Magna is the university's convention hall and capable of seating around 400 people; it is used to host university conferences, speeches, and other public or private events; solely the entrance to the hall is visible above ground. South of the main building, the Central Services offices houses the Rectorate (as of September 1, 2016, until then the Presidency), the Institute for Italian Studies, and core units of the university such as the Media and Communication Service (press office), and the Research Service. Adjacent to the Rectorate building is the so-called \\"Blue building\\", formerly home to the Cantonal laboratory, and today occupied by a number of research institutes of the Faculty of Economics, with offices for faculty, PhD students, assistants, and related administrative staff. Universit√† della Svizzera italiana has 2815 students in 2018-2019; of these 981 (34,85%) are Swiss, and 1834 (65,15%) are foreign. Off-campus, students participate in city-sponsored tourism events, school-sponsored sporting activities, and student associations, despite the town's small population. Around twenty student associations have been established, with student clubs oriented around economics (AIESEC), informatics (EESTEC, IEEE student branch), and communications (L'universo student newspaper).

He was chosen by the Parliament of Singapore in 1970. Before becoming head-of-state, Yusof was a well-known journalist and co-founded Utusan Melayu, which was in circulation till 9 October 2019. He started journalism after he graduated from Raffles Institution in 1929 and in 1932, he joined Warta Malaya, a well-known Malay newspaper company at that time. He left the company in 1938 and co-founded Utusan Melayu. Tun Yusof held many appointments within the Singaporean government. He served on the Film Appeal Committee from 1948 to 1950 and was also a member of both the Nature Reserves Committee and Malayanisation Commission for a year. In July 1959, he was appointed Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Singapore. He was sworn on 3 December that year as Singapore's Yang di-Pertuan Negara (head of state) after the PAP won the first election held in Singapore after Singapore's self-governance.Seet, K. K. (2000). The Istana (pp.88‚Äì89). Singapore: Times Editions. Call no.: RART 725.17095957 IST; Singapore rejoices. (1959, 4 December). The Straits Times, p. 1 Yusof then became the first President of Singapore after the country gained independence on 9 August 1965. His portrait appears on the Singapore Portrait Series currency notes introduced in 1999. Biography=Early life= Yusof (back row, third from left) and his family in 1933. Born on 12 August 1910 in Kampung Padang Gajah, Terong, Taiping, Perak Darul Ridzuan, which was then part of the Federated Malay States (present day Malaysia), Yusof was the eldest son in a family of nine. He was of Minangkabau descent from his father's side while his mother was a Malay from the Langkat region in Indonesia. His father, Ishak bin Ahmad, was also a civil servant and held the post of Acting Director of Fisheries, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States. His brother, Aziz Ishak, was a Malayan journalist and freedom fighter. Yusof received his early education in a Malay school in Kuala Kurau, Perak and began his English studies in 1921 at King Edward VII School in Taiping, He was then admitted to Victoria Bridge School in 1923 when his father was posted to Singapore. In 1924, he was enrolled in Raffles Institution for his secondary education. During his time in Raffles Institution, he played various sports such as swimming, weight lifting, water-polo, boxing, hockey and cricket and had also represented the school in various sporting events. He was also part of the Singapore National Cadet Corps and was commissioned as the first ever cadet officer in the Corps due to his outstanding performance. Yusof received his Cambridge School Certificate with distinction in 1927, he was also awarded the Queen's Scholarship and decided to prolong his studies at Raffles Institution until 1929. =Journalism career= After graduating from Raffles Institution in 1929, Yusof began his career as a journalist and went into partnership with two other friends to publish, Sportsman, a sports magazine devoted entirely to sports. In 1932, Yusof joined Warta Malaya, a well-known newspaper during that time. Warta Malaya was heavily influenced by developments in the Middle East and Yusof wanted a newspaper dedicated to Malay issues. He fulfilled his vision by establishing Utusan Melayu with several Malay leaders in Singapore in May 1939. During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, Utusan Melayu had to stop circulation as machinery used to print the paper were requisitioned to publish the Japanese paper, Berita Malai. Yusof then moved back to Taiping and with the remaining money he had, he opened a provision shop and lived there until the war ended in 1945 and Utusan Melayu resumed publication. In 1957, Yusof moved to Kuala Lumpur and in February 1958, the headquarters of Utusan Melayu was also relocated to the city. During the post-war period, many Malays wanted independence of Malaya from the British and Yusof, fanned this fervour through his publications which resulted in the formation of the United Malay Nationalist Organisation (UMNO) in 1946. However, his democratic ideals were different from UMNO's vision of reestablishing the monarchy of Malaya. This resulted in rising tensions within the Utusan Melayu and in 1959, Yusof had sold his shares he had in the company and resigned as UMNO had bought over almost all of the shares of Utusan Melayu. =Political career and presidency= Yusof held several appointments within the Singaporean government, he had served on the Film Appeal Committee from 1948 to 1950 and was also a member of both the Nature Reserves Committee and Malayanisation Commission for a year. After his resignation from Utusan Melayu, Yusof took the position of Chairman of the Public Service Commission of Singapore at the invitation of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. After PAP's victory from the 1959 Singaporean elections, Yusof was appointed as Yang di-Pertuan Negara and was sworn on 3 December 1959. During his time as Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Singapore was divided by racial conflicts. Yusof actively promoted multiculturalism and reached out to people of all races to help restore trust and confidence after the 1964 racial riots. On 9 August 1965, Singapore was expelled from Malaysia and became an independent nation. The position of Yang di-Pertuan Negara was abolished and Yusof then became the first President of Singapore. As president, Yusof reached out to the people to reassure citizens astonished by Singapore's expulsion and continued to promote multiculturalism and a national identity within the country by visiting constituencies and reached out to different racial and religious groups. Yusof served for three terms in office before he died on 23 November 1970 due to heart failure. Family and personal life Yusof is survived by his wife of twenty one years, Puan Noor Aishah, and their three children, Orkid Kamariah, Imran, and Zuriana. Puan Noor Aishah continued her husband's legacy of public service and was the first Asian to become president of the Singapore Girl Guides Association. She and her now adult children were interviewed for the Channel NewsAsia documentary Daughters of Singapore, which screened in August 2015 as part of the SG50 celebrations and commemorated the spouses of Yusof Ishak and David Marshall, two pioneer leaders of Singapore. Yusof participated in several sports in his youth. He won the Aw Boon Par Cup for boxing in 1932, and was the national lightweight champion in weightlifting in 1933. One of Yusof's hobbies was photography, and a collection of his photographs was donated to the National Archives of Singapore by his widow, Noor Aishah. He also cultivated orchids, and had the tennis courts at his residence on the Istana grounds, Sri Melati, converted into an orchid garden. He performed the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1963. Legacy The following institutions bear Yusof Ishak's name: *Yusof Ishak Secondary School, opened by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 29 July 1966.Tomb of President Yusof Ishak at Kranji State Cemetery *The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) was officially renamed in August 2015 as the ISEAS‚ÄìYusof Ishak Institute, so its name will call to mind Yusof's \\"vision of equality, justice, harmony and strength amid diversity\\". *Yusof Ishak House in National University of Singapore's Kent Ridge campus along Lower Kent Ridge Road. *Masjid Yusof Ishak in Woodlands.

Specialisations  Specialisations of B.Comp may vary greatly, however they may include: * Cognitive Science * Computer Science * Information Technology * Management Information Systems * Medical Informatics * Medical Imaging * Multimedia * Software Engineering  Asia = Malaysian Private University for Computing = Asia Pacific University College of Technology & Innovation (UCTI) and its institute Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) in Malaysia offer wide range of Bachelor of Computing Degrees in Software Engineering, Internet Technology, Mobile Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Management, Computer Security, Biometrics and Computing. * Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) - Malaysia * Asia Pacific University College of Technology & Innovation (UCTI) - Malaysia = National University of Singapore, School of Computing = National University of Singapore (NUS) has a School of Computing (SoC) which offers Bachelor of Computing (Honours). The available specializations are Communications and Media, Computational Biology, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electronic Commerce and Information Systems. The Bachelor of Computing degree can be obtained in conjunction with another degree (double degree programme) or together with a minor in another discipline, subject to approval by the school. Two of its programmes, Computer Science and Information Systems, are certified by ABET to be \\"substantially equivalent\\" to accredited programmes in the United States. * National University of Singapore, School of Computing  Australia  The Bachelor of Computing is commonly being replaced in favour of a newer but similar Bachelor of Information Technology. Computing is also commonly offered as part of an Applied Science, Science, Computer Science, Business or Engineering degree. Like many other Australian undergraduate degrees, a Bachelor of Computing degree usually consists of three years of full-time study. The following Australian Universities offer a Bachelor of Computing program: * Bachelor of Computing at Swinburne University of Technology * Bachelor of Computing at University of Tasmania UWS  North America = Queen's University School of Computing = Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, offers the Bachelor of Computing (B.Cmp.) and the Bachelor of Computing (Honours) (B.Cmp.H.) degrees. Four Honours specializations are available: Biomedical Computing, Cognitive Science, Software Design, and Computer Science. An Honours degree can also be obtained with a major in Computing, and a Minor or \\"General\\" specialization in Computing can be added to other arts and science degrees. Multi-Disciplinary Programs Queen's University offers students an enormous range of programs combining a significant concentration in Computing with other subjects. The Biomedical Computing program (code BMCO) combines a strong Computing and Math component, foundational courses in the life sciences (Biology, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pharmacology), and specialized courses in Computational Biology and Medical Informatics (17.5 core credits plus 2.5 elective credits). Cognitive Science (code COGS) combines Computing and Math with Cognitive Psychology, Philosophy and Linguistics (16 core credits plus 4 elective credits). Computing and the Creative Arts (code COCA) is a Special Field program combining a concentration in Computing with a concentration in one of four Arts subjects: Art, Drama, Film, and Music. There are also so- called medial programs (code MED) combining a 7-credit Computing concentration with 7-credit concentrations in any of the natural and physical sciences, Math, or Statistics (Bachelor of Science, honours), or any of the social sciences, humanities, or languages (Bachelor of Arts, honours), plus 6 elective credits. The Major-General (code MJG) and Major-Minor (code MJM) degrees allow a student to combine a major concentration (10 credits) in one subject with a general concentration (typically 8 credits) or a minor concentration (typically 6 credits), respectively, in another subject. * Queen's University School of Computing = University of Guelph School of Computer Science = The University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, offers the Bachelor of Computing (B.Comp.).

The area is roughly bounded by the edge of Luton to the north, Vauxhall Way and Turners Road North to the south, Bradgers Hill to the west, and Cannon Lane, Stapleford Road and Brays Road to the east. Etymology Frederick Davis, writing in 1965 believed the name of Stospley to come from Scrobbale, (in Saxon;) Scrapes or Scroppeslie, (in Norman;) Shrubsley, (in English.;) meaning a hill covered with scrobbes (shrubs or underwood.) Most modern etymologists consider the name to be made up of two elements 'Stopp' and 'ley'. dating between AD 750 and AD 950. The ending comes from the Old English 'leah' meaning a wood or clearing in a wood. 'Stopp' was a personal name and indicated ownership of the wood or clearing. It appears as 'Stopeslegh in Soca de Luton' in a (Latin) law record, dated 1440.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/717; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no717/bCP40no717dorses/IMG_1635.htm haadihayat Originally a hill-top village settlement, most of the urbanised part of the civil parish of Stopsley became part of Luton when the boundaries were extended in 1933, with the rural areas going to Hyde and Streatley. Local Area The centre of Stopsley is made up of a series of local shops around a village church. From a distance the skyline is dominated by Jansel House, an office block built in 1961 which houses the Luton VAT office over a parade of shops at street level including a Greengrocer, Chemist, Charity Shop. Estate Agent, hairdresser and cafe. One of Luton's two cemeteries, The Vale, is located nearby on the Hitchin Road. The centre of Stopsley Village contains many shops on either side of the road including a Barclays branch (now closed), Co-Operative supermarket, Henderson newsagents (now closed), Cafe, Tesco Express, Chemist, Hardware, charity shops, Sandwich stores and Off licences/Wine stores. There are also several takeaways and restaurants such as; Ashuka, Stopsley Surma, May Sek Oriental, Jay Raj Indian Cuisine, Pankaj Sor. The HSBC branch that was based in Stopsley closed its doors in September, 2015. Many estate and lettings agents are also situated in the Stopsley Village and Jansel House area, Connors, Haart, Taylors and Acorn Residential Lettings. Stopsley High School is also in the area. Politics Stopsley is part of the larger Stopsley ward which also includes Putteridge and part of Ramridge End. The ward is represented by Cllr David Wynn (Liberal Democrats) and Cllr Richard Underwood (Liberal Democrats). The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Luton South, and the MP is Rachel Hopkins (Labour Party).

The species is endemic to Australia. Originally described by George Shaw in 1794 as a species new to science, it is one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around in length, it has glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks, and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked. Although its venom is capable of causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants and has haemolytic properties; victims can also lose their sense of smell. Common in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations. Taxonomy The red-bellied black snake was first described and named by English naturalist George Shaw in Zoology of New Holland (1794) as Coluber porphyriacus. Incorrectly assuming it was harmless, he wrote, \\"This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature.\\" The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek porphyreus, which can mean \\"dark purple\\", \\"red-purple\\" or \\"beauteous\\". It was the first Australian elapid snake described. The syntype is presumed lost. French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de described it under the name Trimeresurus leptocephalus in 1804. His countryman Ren√© Lesson described it as Acanthophis tortor in 1826. German biologist Hermann Schlegel felt it was allied with cobras and called it Naja porphyrica in 1837. \\"Coluber porphyriacus\\", Zoology and botany of New Holland (1794),Tab. X of: Zoology and botany of New Holland and the isles adjacent / the zoological part by George Shaw, the botanical part by James Edward Smith; the figures by James Sowerby. illustration from original description The genus Pseudechis was created for it by German biologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1830, to which several more species have been added subsequently. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words pseudƒìs \\"false\\", and echis \\"viper\\". Snake expert Eric Worrell, in 1961, analysed the skulls of the genus and found that of the red-bellied black snake to be the most divergent. Its position as an early offshoot from the rest of the genus has been confirmed genetically in 2017. Snake handler Raymond Hoser described two extra subspecies in 2003: P. p. eipperi from the Atherton Tableland and surrounds in north-east Queensland, which he noted was smaller, rarely attaining 2 m (7 ft) and had a white or pale pink rather than red belly, and P. p. rentoni from southeastern South Australia, which has a variably coloured (often orange or even blueish-tinged) belly. He added that both were disjunct from the main red-bellied black snake population, and as the distinguishing traits of P. p. rentoni were not consistent, then location was the most reliable way of identifying it. These subspecies have not been recognized by other authors, and Hoser has been strongly criticized for identifying some taxa on location alone, and omitting, misinterpreting or inventing evidence of distinctness. In addition to red-bellied black snake, the species has been called common black snake, redbelly, and RBBS. It was known as djirrabidi to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. Description The red-bellied black snake has a glossy black top body with a light-grey snout and brown mouth, and a completely black tail. It lacks a well-defined neck; its head merges seamlessly into the body. Its flanks are bright red or orange, fading to pink or dull red on the belly. All these scales have black margins. Snakes from northern populations tend to have lighter, more cream or pink bellies. The red-bellied black snake is on average around long, the largest individual recorded at . Males are generally slightly larger than females. A large specimen caught in Newcastle has been estimated to weigh around . The red-bellied black snake can have a strong smell, which some field experts have used to find the snakes in the wild. Like all elapid snakes, it is proteroglyphous (front-fanged). Juveniles are similar to the eastern small-eyed snake (Cryptophis nigrescens), with which it can be easily confused, although the latter species lacks the red flanks. Other similar species include the blue-bellied black snake (Pseudechis guttatus) and copperheads of the genus Austrelaps. An early misconception was that the red- bellied black snake was sexually dimorphic, and that the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) was the female form. This was recognised as such by Australian zoologist Gerard Krefft in his 1869 work Snakes of Australia. =Scalation= The number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The red-bellied black snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 180 to 215 ventral scales, 48 to 60 subcaudal scales (the anterior‚Äîand sometimes all‚Äîsubcaudals are undivided), and a divided anal scale. There are two anterior and two posterior temporal scales, and the rostral shield is roughly square-shaped. Distribution and habitat Closeup, showing paler snout and forked tongue The red-bellied black snake is native to the east coast of Australia, where it is one of the most commonly encountered snakes. It can be found in the urban forest, woodland, plains, and bushland areas of the Blue Mountains, Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Cairns, and Adelaide. The Macquarie Marshes mark a western border to its distribution in New South Wales, and Gladstone in central Queensland marks the northern limit to the main population. To the south, it occurs across eastern and central Victoria, and extends along the Murray River into South Australia. Disjunct populations occur in the southern Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia and in North Queensland. The red-bellied black snake is most commonly seen close to dams, streams, billabongs, and other bodies of water, although they can venture up to away, including into nearby backyards. In particular, the red-bellied black snake prefers areas of shallow water with tangles of water plants, logs, or debris. Behaviour Red-bellied black snakes can hide in many places in their habitat, including logs, old mammal burrows, and grass tussocks. They can flee into water and hide there; one was reported as staying submerged for 23 minutes. When swimming, they may hold their full head or the nostrils above the water's surface. At times, they may float without moving on the water surface, thus looking like a stick. Within their habitat, red-bellied black snakes appear to have ranges or territories with which they are familiar and generally remain within. A 1987 field study in three New South Wales localities found that these areas vary widely, from in size. Within their territory, they may have some preferred places to reside. The red-bellied black snake is generally not an aggressive species, typically withdrawing when approached. If provoked, it recoils into a striking stance as a threat, holding its head and front part of its body horizontally above the ground and widening and flattening its neck. It may bite as a last resort. It is generally active by day, though nighttime activity has occasionally been recorded. When not hunting or basking, it may be found beneath timber, rocks, and rubbish or down holes and burrows. Snakes are active when their body temperatures are between . They also thermoregulate by basking in warm, sunny spots in the cool, early morning and rest in shade in the middle of hot days, and may reduce their activity in hot, dry weather in late summer and autumn. Rather than entering true hibernation, red-bellied black snakes become relatively inactive over winter, retreating to cover and at times emerging on warm, sunny days. Their dark colour allows them to absorb heat from sunshine more quickly. In July 1949, six large individuals were found hibernating under a concrete slab in marshland in Woy Woy, New South Wales. Groups of up to six hibernating red-bellied black snakes have been recorded from under concrete slabs around Mount Druitt and Rooty Hill in western Sydney. Males are more active in the Southern Hemisphere spring (early October to November) as they roam looking for mates; one reportedly travelled in a day. In summer, both sexes are less active generally. =Reproduction= In spring, male red-bellied black snakes often engage in ritualised combat for 2 to 30 minutes, even attacking other males already mating with females. They wrestle vigorously, but rarely bite, and engage in head-pushing contests, where each snake tries to push his opponent's head downward with his chin. The male seeks out a female and rubs his chin on her body, and may twitch, hiss, and rarely bite as he becomes aroused. The female indicates readiness to mate by straightening out and allowing their bodies to align. Pregnancy takes place any time from early spring to late summer. Females become much less active and band together in small groups in late pregnancy. They share the same retreat and bask in the sun together. The red-bellied black snake is ovoviviparous; that is, it gives birth to live young in individual membranous sacs, after 14 weeks' gestation, usually in February or March. The young, numbering between eight and 40, emerge from their sacs very shortly after birth, and have an average length around . Young snakes almost triple their length and increase their weight 18-fold in their first year of life, and are sexually mature when they reach SVL (snoutvent length) of for males or for females. Females can breed at around 31 months of age, while males can slightly earlier. Red- bellied black snakes can live up to 25 years. =Feeding= green tree snake near Dungog, New South Wales The diet of red-bellied black snakes primarily consists of frogs, but they also prey on reptiles and small mammals. They also eat other snakes, including those of their own species. Fish are hunted in water. Red-bellied black snakes may hunt on or under the water surface, and prey can be eaten underwater or brought to the surface. They have been recorded stirring up substrate, possibly to disturb prey. As red-bellied black snakes grow and mature, they continue to eat the same size prey, but add larger animals, as well. Although they prefer live food, red-bellied black snakes have been reported eating frogs squashed by cars. They are susceptible to cane toad (Rhinella marina) toxins. The introduction of cane toads in Australia dates to 1935, when they were introduced in an attempt at biological control of native beetles, which were damaging sugarcane fields (a non-native plant). The intervention failed, mostly because the toads are on the ground, while the beetles feed on leaves at the top of the plant. One research study concluded that in less than 75 years, the red-bellied black snake had evolved in toad-inhabited regions of Australia to have increased resistance to toad toxin and decreased preference for toads as prey. Venom Early settlers feared the red-bellied black snake, though it turned out to be much less dangerous than many other species. The murine median lethal dose (LD50) is 2.52 mg/kg when administered subcutaneously. A red-bellied black snake yields an average of 37 mg of venom when milked, with the maximum recorded being 94 mg. It accounted for 16% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, with no deaths recorded. Its venom contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants and also has haemolytic properties. Rearing in an aggressive posture, flattening of neck Bites from red-bellied black snakes can be very painful‚Äîneeding analgesia‚Äîand result in local swelling, prolonged bleeding, and even local necrosis, particularly if the bite is on a finger. Severe local reactions may require surgical debridement or even amputation. Symptoms of systemic envenomation‚Äîincluding nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or excessive sweating‚Äîwere thought to be rare, but a 2010 review found they occurred in most bite victims. Most people also go on to develop an anticoagulant coagulopathy in a few hours. This is characterised by a raised activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and subsides over 24 hours. It resolves quickly with antivenom. A few people go on to develop a myotoxicity and associated generalised muscle pain and occasionally weakness, which may last up to 7 days. Patients may suffer a loss of sense of smell (anosmia); this is unrelated to the severity of the envenoming and can be temporary or permanent. Although the venom contains the three-finger toxin Œ±-elapitoxin-Ppr1, which acts as a neurotoxin in laboratory experiments, neurotoxic symptoms are generally absent in clinical cases. A biologically active agent‚Äîpseudexin‚Äîwas isolated from red-bellied black snake venom in 1981. Making up 25% of the venom, it is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight around 16.5 kilodaltons. In 1989, it was found to be composed of three phospholipase A2 isoenzymes. If antivenom is indicated, red-bellied black snake bites are generally treated with tiger snake antivenom. While black snake antivenom can be used, tiger snake antivenom can be used at a lower volume and is a cheaper treatment. It is the most commonly reported species responsible for envenomed dogs in New South Wales. In 2006, a 12-year- old golden retriever suffered rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury secondary to a red-bellied black snake bite. Laboratory testing has found that cats are relatively resistant to the venom, with a lethal dose as high as 7 mg/kg. Conservation and threats The red-bellied black snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its preferred habitat has been particularly vulnerable to urban development and is highly fragmented, and a widespread decline in frogs, which are its preferred prey, has occurred. Snake numbers appear to have declined. Feral cats are known to prey on red-bellied black snakes, while young snakes presumably are taken by laughing kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae), brown falcons (Falco berigora), and other raptors. Captivity One of the snakes commonly kept as pets in Australia, the red-bellied black snake adapts readily to captivity and lives on a supply of mice, though it can also survive on fish fillets, chicken, and dog food.

It represents the interests of the sector to government (particularly the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)) and other agencies, and promotes community radio in Canada. Since 1981, it has helped lower tariffs affecting radio stations and assisted new stations to launch, as well as to obtain operating funds. Core initiatives include GroundWire, Dig Your Roots, !earshot, Women‚Äôs Hands and Voices, the Community Radio Fund of Canada, sector-wide listservs, and an annual radio conference. The head office of the NCRA/ANREC is located in Ottawa. A majority of English-language campus and community radio stations in Canada are members of the NCRA. History In February 1981, the first National Campus Radio Conference (NCRC) was held in Ottawa, hosted by CKCU. At that conference, the National Campus/Community Radio Organization (NCRO) was formed to promote campus radio across Canada. In August 1983, NCRC delegates voted to formalize the structure of the NCRO further and to establish a volunteer office to carry out a variety of services for member stations. The office initially operated from CKCU-FM, at Carleton University in Ottawa. That year the Alternative Radio News Service, a regular mailout of alternative news and information to campus and community stations, was started at CKMS-FM at the University of Waterloo. In the early years, the NCRO published a monthly newsletter and alternative album chart. It also made presentations to the CRTC on a number of issues relating to community radio in Canada, including efforts to reduce content restrictions the CRTC had placed on the limited form of commercial advertising allowed on campus and community stations at the time. The organization was also actively involved in assisting the growing number of campus-based radio groups applying for FM radio licenses in the early 1980s. In July 1986 the NCRO was incorporated as the National Campus and Community Radio Association Inc./L'Association nationale de radios √©tudiantes et communautaires Inc. (NCRA/ANREC). In the early 1990s, there was a national office and executive director for a short period of time, but due to lack of stable funding, among other problems, the office closed after less than one year. In February 2002, a new office was formed in Montreal with a national coordinator, which moved to Ottawa in May 2005, where it currently operates. Chart and !earshot The Canadian music magazine Chart was founded as an internal NCRA/ANREC publication; when it incorporated as an independent newsstand title, the NCRA began publishing !earshot, which is a regular supplement in Exclaim!. Many campus and community radio stations continue to file airplay charts with both publications. Dig Your Roots In 2001, after Corus Entertainment, a major broadcasting company in Canada, bought out a number of radio stations across Canada, as per federal regulations the CRTC required that they put a total of 6% of the assets from this transfer of ownership towards artist development. The money was given by Corus Entertainment to the NCRA/ANREC to start up and maintain the Dig Your Roots/D√©couvre tes racines project, a series of genre-specific compilation albums that coincided with live concert simulcast broadcasts. Dig Your Roots concluded in 2007. National Campus and Community Radio Conference The NCRC is an annual national gathering of community-oriented radio broadcasters. It has been offered every summer since 1981, and it is one of the core activities of the NCRA/ANREC. It is usually hosted by a different radio station in different locations each year. During the conference, delegates attend workshops, seminars, the annual general meeting of the NCRA (during which board members are elected, the treasurer's report is approved, the business of the association is accomplished by the membership, and the next conference's host radio station selected), seminars, live shows, and feature presentations. National Women in Radio Conference Up until 2012, a Women in Radio Conference was held during the national conference. This was replaced with the Equity Radio Day to be held on a weekend during the conference. =Conferences= * 1981 CKCU - Ottawa, ON * 1983 In conjunction with first AMARC conference, Montreal, QC * 1984 CITR ‚Äì Vancouver, BC * 1985 CHSR ‚Äì Fredericton, NB * 1986 CJSW ‚Äì Calgary, AB * 1987 CKLN ‚Äì Toronto, ON * 1988 CKDU ‚Äì Halifax, NS * 1989 CFUV ‚Äì Victoria, BC * 1990 CJSW ‚Äì Calgary, AB * 1991 CKUT ‚Äì Montreal, QC * 1992 CITR ‚Äì Vancouver, BC * 1993 CFLR ‚Äì Sudbury, ON * 1994 CHSR ‚Äì Fredericton, NB * 1995 CJSR ‚Äì Edmonton, AB * 1996 CFMU ‚Äì Hamilton, ON * 1997 CIUT ‚Äì Toronto, ON * 1998 CFUV ‚Äì Victoria, BC * 1999 CKDU ‚Äì Halifax, NS * 2000 CKUW ‚Äì Winnipeg, MB * 2001 CHUO ‚Äì Ottawa, ON * 2002 CFMH ‚Äì Saint John, NB * 2003 CKUW ‚Äì Winnipeg, MB * 2004 CJSR ‚Äì Edmonton, AB * 2005 CFRU ‚Äì Guelph, ON * 2006 NCRA/ANREC ‚Äì Ottawa, ON * 2007 CITR ‚Äì Vancouver, BC * 2008 CJAM ‚Äì Windsor, ON * 2009 CKUT - Montreal, QC * 2010 CKGI - Gabriola Community Radio - Gabriola Island, BC * 2011 CKDU - Halifax, Nova Scotia * 2012 CFRC - Kingston, Ontario * 2013 CKUW - Winnipeg, MB * 2014 CFUV - Victoria, BC * 2015 CFMH - Saint John, NB * 2016 CHUO - Ottawa, ON *2017 CIVL - Abbotsford, BC See also * List of campus radio stations in Canada * List of community radio stations in Canada External links * NCRA/ANREC Home * GroundWire - Bringing you national grassroots news monthly * 25th Annual National Campus and Community Radio Conference June 5‚Äì10, 2006 Ottawa, Ontario * Dig Your Roots.

Finally at the Harbour lies Canada Place and the Vancouver Convention Centre. Nearer to Burrard Bridge is located St. Paul's Hospital, established on Burrard Street in 1894. Burrard Street served as the dividing line between the two district lots laid out on the downtown peninsula in the second half of the 19th century: District Lot 185 (now West End) and District Lot 541 (granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway). The two grids were oriented differently, with the result that only every third northwest-southeast street in DL185 actually continuing southeast beyond Burrard into DL541. Burrard currently serves as the boundary between West End and Downtown, as defined by the City of Vancouver.Vancouver - communityWEBpages - West End Burrard Street is served by SkyTrain's Burrard Station, located underground between the intersections with Melville and Dunsmuir Streets in the heart of the Financial District. Along the downtown portion, there is a bike lane on the southwest-bound direction towards the Burrard Bridge.

Luminophores can be either organic or inorganic. Luminophores can be further classified as fluorophores or phosphors, depending on the nature of the excited state responsible for the emission of photons. However, some luminophores cannot be classified as being exclusively fluorophores or phosphors. Examples include transition-metal complexes such as tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride, whose luminescence comes from an excited (nominally triplet) metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) state, which is not a true triplet state in the strict sense of the definition; and colloidal quantum dots, whose emissive state does not have either a purely singlet or triplet spin. Most luminophores consist of conjugated œÄ systems or transition-metal complexes. There are also purely inorganic luminophores, such as zinc sulfide doped with rare-earth metal ions, rare-earth metal oxysulfides doped with other rare-earth metal ions, yttrium oxide doped with rare-earth metal ions, zinc orthosilicate doped with manganese ions, etc. Luminophores can be observed in action in fluorescent lights, television screens, computer monitor screens, organic light-emitting diodes and bioluminescence.

Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's endemic species, as well as important breeding grounds for seabirds and some marine mammals. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human disturbance and particularly to introduced species, due to their small size. Island groups such as New Zealand and Hawaii have undergone substantial extinctions and losses of habitat. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species. Islands, endemism and extinction Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of Island biogeography, formulated by Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of New Zealand's bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance. Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to predators. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of tameness. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that moas were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the dodo, are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the Pacific islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD. Takahe have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on Kapiti Island. The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species. =Eradication of introduced alien species= One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of invasive alien species. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased. A definitive list of past island restoration efforts exists as the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications. In addition a list of the current invasive species present on the world's islands exists as the Threatened Island Database Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors & Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of Round Island, in Mauritius, all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a Judas goat, where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting. Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is poisoning, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the Falkland Islands, in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands and Rat Island (Hawadax) in the Aleutian archipelago. In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land crabs instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats. The removal of invasive weeds is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of sandbur, Cencrus echinatus, an introduced grass on Laysan. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native bunchgrass, and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the Laysan duck and Laysan finch, as well as those of several seabirds. The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year. Invasive vertebrate eradication has many benefits besides conservation of species and has been found to align with 13 UN Sustainable Development Goals and 42 associated targets encompassing marine and terrestrial biodiversity conservation, promotion of local and global partnerships, economic development, climate change mitigation, human health and sanitation and sustainable production and consumption. Strategies There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication. Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact. Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness. Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levelsMyers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A. M. & Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology & Evolution 15, 316‚Äì320. ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383. Methods Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication. Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly. Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at. This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture. Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large. Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use. Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems. Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well. Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly. =Restoration of former habitat= In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of endangered species, where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management. One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival. Opposition to island restoration Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the animal rights movement, which contends that the welfare of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and sterilization be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in Kangaroo Island koalas.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well. Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of hedgehog removal in the Outer Hebrides offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of Eucalyptus trees from Angel Island in San Francisco Bay faced considerable opposition. Island restoration projects Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications. = Round Island = Round Island (√éle Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of Mauritius, with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres. Compared to other Mascarene islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810). These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a positive feedback mechanism that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts. Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, Latania loddigesii, Pandanus vandermeerschii and Hyophorbe lagenicaulis, which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were critically endangered) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks Leiolopisma telfaririi and Scelotes bojerii, the geckos Phelsuma guentheri, P. ornata and Nactus serpensinsula, and the snake Casarea dussumerii. The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. =Aleutian Islands= Arctic fox with least auklet. The Aleutian Islands, prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century Arctic foxes were introduced to act as a source for the fur trade, a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly seabirds like the whiskered auklet. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the ecology of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003. =Campbell Island= Campbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700 km south of New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113 km2, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding. = South Georgia = Rats, brought to South Georgia Island as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century, have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds‚Äô eggs and chicks. While previously the island's glaciers formed a natural barrier to the spread of rats, these glaciers are now slowly melting as the climate warms. In 2011, scientists instituted a four-year programme to entirely eradicate the rats and mice, in what would be by far the largest rodent eradication attempt in the world to date. The project was led by zoologist Anthony Martin of The University of Dundee who stated, \\"This is a man-induced problem and it's about time that man put right earlier errors.\\" In July 2013, the success of the main phase of the extermination of the rats, which took place in May that year, was announced. 180 tonnes of rat poison, brodifacoum, were dropped over 70% of the island, in what was the world's largest ever operation of this kind. Another 95t of rat poison was planned to be dropped by three helicopters in January 2015. In June 2015 the eradication programme concluded, apparently successfully, with the island believed \\"very likely\\" to be rat free. Monitoring will continue for a further two or three years.\\"Rare birds return to remote South Georgia island after successful rat eradication programme\\", The Independent, 25 June 2015 NotesReferences * Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M.

His command precipitated a notable cavalry raid in 1863, known as Streight's Raid. He was a prisoner of war for 10 months. On March 12, 1866, his nomination for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, to rank from March 13, 1865 was confirmed. He later became a politician, and served as a state senator in Indiana for two terms. Early life and Civil War Abel Streight was born in Wheeler, New York, son of Asa Streight and Lydia Spaulding Streight.The Ancestors and Descendants of Rev. Phineas Spaulding (1759-1838), by Michael Spaulding, (c) 2000, page 48. On 14 Jan 1849 he married Lavina or Lovina McCarty, who was born 1830, Bath Twp., Steuben Co., NY and died 5 Jun 1910, Marion Co., IN. He moved to Cincinnati, as a young man, and by 1859 was living in Indianapolis, where he was a publisher of books and maps. Streight was appointed colonel of the 51st Indiana Infantry regiment on December 12, 1861.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 758. His regiment was soon attached to the Union Army of the Cumberland. Streight and his regiment saw very limited action during the first two years of their service, which is said to have disappointed him greatly. In 1863, he proposed a plan to Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield (chief of staff of the Army of the Cumberland) that he be allowed to raise a force to make a raid deeply into the South. His proposal was to disrupt the Western & Atlantic Railroad from Chattanooga to Atlanta, which carried supplies to the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The Union Army's commander, William S. Rosecrans, gave him permission. Union forces from Streight's own 51st Indiana, 73rd Indiana Infantry, 80th Illinois Infantry, and 3rd Ohio Infantry regiments were placed under Streight's command. This force encompassed approximately 1,700 troops. The original intent was to have this force mounted suitably for fast travel and attacks; however, due largely to wartime shortages, Streight's brigade were equipped with mules. This obvious disadvantage, combined with Streight's own inexperience, was to prove disastrous. Route of Streight's Raid in 1863 Streight led this force to Nashville, departed Tuscumbia, Alabama, on April 26, 1863, and then to Eastport, Mississippi. From there he decided to push to the southeast, initially screened by another Union force commanded by Brig. Gen. Grenville Dodge. On April 30, Streight's brigade arrived at Sand Mountain, where he was intercepted by a Confederate cavalry force under Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and harassed for several days. Streight's force won the Battle of Day's Gap but the battle set off a series of skirmishes that eventually led the Union forces being surrounded and captured.Day's Gap Streight himself was captured at Cedar Bluff, Alabama on May 3, 1863, and taken to Libby Prison as a prisoner of war. Lovina McCarthy Streight and the couple's five-year-old son accompanied the 51st into the South with Lovina acting as a nurse for the regiment. The soldiers dubbed her \\"The Mother of the 51st\\" for her contributions. Lovina was captured three times by Confederate soldiers. Twice she was exchanged in return for prisoners of war. The third time she escaped using a gun she had hidden under her skirts. On February 9, 1864, after ten months of incarceration, Streight and 107 other soldiers escaped from Libby Prison by tunnelling from their barracks to freedom. Eventually, Streight was able to cross through enemy territory and, on his return, gave a debriefing report to his Union commanders. Eventually Streight was restored to active duty being placed in command of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IV Corps. He participated in the battles of Franklin and Nashville. Streight resigned from the army on March 16, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Streight for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 758. Postbellum career Portrait of Lovina McCarthy Streight by Julia Cox (1880) In 1866, Streight and his wife built a house on 4121 East Washington Street in Indianapolis. In 1876, Streight ran successfully for a seat in the Indiana Senate, serving a two-year term. In 1880, he ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for governor of Indiana. In 1888, he was once again elected as State Senator. He died in Indianapolis four years later, in 1892, from complications of Bright's Disease.Lovina Streight Research Files 1861-2003 at the Indiana Historical Society. Processed by Kate Scott, May 2014. Collection # M 1099. See biographical sketch. Although initially buried on the front lawn of his residence, his grave was eventually moved in 1902 to Crown Hill Cemetery. The grave includes a bronze bust of the general. Streight was the author of The Crisis of Eighteen Hundred and Sixty- one in the Government of the United States, published in 1861. Streight's wife Lovina joined her husband on his southern campaign, often ministering help to wounded men during the battle. She was captured three times and exchanged for prisoners. When Abel died in 1892 she had him buried in the front yard of their home, stating, \\"I never knew where he was in life, but now I can find him.\\"Willett, Robert L.; The Lightning Mule Brigade, Carmel, IN, 1999, p. 196. Lovina Streight was known as the \\"Mother of the 51st\\", and upon her death in 1910, her funeral was afforded full military honors. It was said at the time that her funeral drew the largest crowd of mourners to Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis since the funeral of President Benjamin Harrison.obit. of Lavina Streight, Indianapolis Star, 7 & 9 Jun 1910, p. 1 In her will, she directed that the family mansion should become a home for aged women; however, relatives successfully challenged the will on the grounds that she was of ‚Äúunsound mind.‚Äù The main arguments used by the plaintiffs were that she believed in spiritualism and was under the influence of B.

In 1926, Earl W. Oglebay (of Oglebay, Norton, and Company) deeded his estate, Waddington Farms, to the city of Wheeling for the express purpose of public recreation. The park has been open to the public since 1928 when its governing body, the Wheeling Park Commission, began operations. Several Waddington Farms buildings, including the Mansion Museum and the greenhouse, remain in use today. Others, such as the Carriage House, have been rebuilt in the style of the original structures. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Oglebay Mansion is operated as a museum by the Oglebay Institute. The park currently incorporates two championship golf courses, two standard courses (9-hole and 18-hole), one par three course, eleven tennis courts, a large outdoor pool, extensive walking trails, the Good Zoo, the Mansion Museum (operated by the Oglebay Institute), gardens, a greenhouse, the Anne Kuchinka Amphitheater, the Wilson Lodge (containing over 271 rooms), 54 cottages, The Schrader Center (a nature center operated by the Oglebay Institute), a planetarium (located within the Good Zoo), a ski slope, Camp Russel, and Schenk Lake, which is used for fishing, pedal boating, Segway tours, and several nightly fountain shows in season. Annual events at the park include, but are not limited to: The Winter Festival of Lights, Oglebayfest, the Ohio County Fair, the West Virginia Open (tennis), Springfest, and Fort Henry Days (a living history weekend). Oglebay Mansion and Waddington Farm The Oglebay Mansion was built in 1846 by Paul Matvey as an eight-room farmhouse. Earl W. Oglebay, co-founder of the Oglebay-Norton Company, purchased the mansion and its adjoining areas in 1900, renamed it Waddington Farm, and used it as his summer estate and model farm. He was the ninth owner of the home and its adjoining land, and expanded the farmhouse into a mansion by adding additional wings and architectural features like the front portico. He gradually expanded the estate by purchasing adjacent farms until Waddington Farm had grown from to at the time of his death in 1926. The mansion became a museum in 1930. The museum, which includes restored rooms, local history exhibits, and exhibits on Earl W. Oglebay and his former estate, is operated by the Oglebay Institute and is open to the public for tours and programs throughout the year The mansion before Earl W. Oglebay made major renovations to the original farmhouse. Earl W. Oglebay's hope was to develop Waddington Farm as a model farm, a laboratory for new agricultural changes that could be used to end the great starvation in the United States. He lent out parts of the farm to various researchers so that they could learn about crop rotation, soil improvement, and cost-cutting methods. Waddington Farm once incorporated a dairy farm, a poultry farm, a pig farm, and a sheep farm as well as stables, vineyards, a greenhouse, a rose garden, groves of fruit trees, vegetable gardens for the consumption of those living within the estate, and the areas used to research agricultural techniques. Oglebay's unconventional farming methods resulted in criticism by the agricultural community. To them, he was \\"a man from the city trying outlandish things\\", but after they saw the results of his experiments, they thought differently. Winter Festival of Lights Party This 1985 holiday tradition began at Oglebay Park, but soon spread throughout the city of Wheeling. The first year, displays and landscape lighting covered over a three-mile (5 km) drive throughout the resort. The show now covers more than over a six-mile (10 km) drive throughout the park. Landscape lighting expert Dick Bosch and the late Robert J. Otten, Wheeling Park Commission's long-time creative director, were the creative talents behind Oglebay's party. Bosch's lighting expertise was needed to produce the lighting for trees and buildings, and Bob Otten designed the first five displays for the 1985 opening and created nearly 50 additional displays until his death in 2005. Every year, several new displays are added. Notable displays from past years include the Snowflake Tunnel, a display that allows visitors to drive through a lighted tunnel portraying thousands of twinkling snowflakes, the massive Polyhedron Star, which includes over 2,000 lights, and the Poinsettia Wreath and Candle, which is the festival's tallest. Other displays include the Candy Cane Wreath, The Twelve Days of Christmas, or Willard the Snowman, named for the television personality Willard Scott, who switched on the lights for Light-Up Night in 1986. Every year, local students in Ohio County Schools submit new display ideas. Most displays are fabricated at Wheeling Park High School, where welding technology students build the frames for the displays. The school's electronics technology program has designed, built, and programmed the controls for every animated display at the Festival. The high school's radio station WPHP 91.9 also broadcasts seasonal music along with information about the resort and overall light show every evening from 5 - 11 pm. Two of the park's light displays are synchronized to music. \\"Gardens of Light\\" and the Good Zoo's \\"Lighting and Music Extravaganza\\" were designed by Carson Williams, who created the original Wizards in Winter light display at his home in Mason, Ohio. The Good Zoo's light party, added in 2006, utilizes upwards of 35,500 LED bulbs and is controlled by a computer. This technology allows the lights to be synchronized with music. The \\"Gardens of Light\\" display, which was added in 2007, is very similar to the Good Zoo's light party, but on a much larger scale. In this display, park visitors walk through the gardens, which incorporate hanging flower baskets with lights and lighted flowers in the flowerbeds. The \\"Gardens of Light\\" display is an attempt to recreate the look of Oglebay Park's flower gardens during the spring and summer months. In 2008, Oglebay announced that all new displays will use LED lights, rather than the incandescent lights that were used before. In addition, the park will gradually convert the existing displays to use LED lights. The new lights will use 85% less energy and last five times longer, according to Oglebay's website. Good Zoo The Good Zoo is a facility that houses over 80 species of animals. The zoo was dedicated in memory of a seven-year-old boy, Philip Mayer Good, who loved nature. He was the son of Barbara and Larry Good of Wheeling. As of 2019, the Good Zoo's collection includes cheetahs, zebras, kangaroos, wallabys, tamarins, lemurs, ostriches, llamas, goats, barn owls, bald eagles, red pandas, gorals, peacocks, white-naped cranes, a small gang of meerkats and many other animals from all over the globe. There is a discovery lab, with an indoor South American rainforest exhibit, an aviary, which houses avian life including the rainbow lorikeet, the blue mountain (Swainson's) lorikeet, the green-naped lorikeet and more. The Good Zoo is the only AZA accredited zoo in West Virginia. The Good Zoo is also home to a veterinary hospital where visitors can view operations and routine checkups. The hospital is used as a treatment area for zoo animals, a breeding center for certain species, a quarantine area for incoming animals, and a rehabilitation center for wild raptors. The zoo's raptor rehabilitation program has successfully treated many raptors and other native birds since its establishment. The zoo's turkey vultures, bald eagles are two of the animals on exhibit. The Good Zoo has many SSP programs. The Species Survival Plan (SSP) is a cooperative breeding and conservation program instituted by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The goal of SSP programs is to help as many species as possible through captive breeding, education, research, and habitat preservation. Annual events at the Good Zoo include \\"Boo at the Zoo\\" (in October), and \\"The Good Zoo Lights Up For You\\" (during the Festival of Lights), not to mention an annual car show at nearby Camp Russel, Easter egg hunt. =Animals=References External links  * Oglebay Resort & Conference Center * Oglebay's Calendar of Events * The Museums of Oglebay Institute * National Register of Historic Places, Ohio County, West Virginia * The Good Zoo Web site Category:Houses in Wheeling, West Virginia Category:Golf clubs and courses in West Virginia Category:Greek Revival houses in West Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1846 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Municipal parks in West Virginia Category:Museums in Ohio County, West Virginia Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Protected areas of Ohio County, West Virginia Category:Tourist attractions in Ohio County, West Virginia Category:Geography of Wheeling, West Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wheeling, West Virginia Category:1928 establishments in West Virginia ","title":"Oglebay Park"},{"id":"2290822","text":"O.C. and Stiggs is a 1987 American teen comedy film directed by Robert Altman, based on two characters that were originally featured in a series of stories published in National Lampoon magazine. The film stars Daniel H. Jenkins and Neill Barry as the title characters.

O.C. and Stiggs were recurring characters in articles in the magazine, eventually leading up to the entire October 1982 issue being devoted to a fictional first-person account of the story of their summer, \\"The Utterly Monstrous Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs\\". The plotline and main characters of the movie were significantly different from the National Lampoon stories they were based on. Most notably, the original magazine characters were destructive, malevolent teenagers, whereas the main characters of the movie were not inherently destructive, and significant portions of the magazine story were omitted from the movie. =Aftermath= In an interview years later, included on the DVD release of Tanner '88, Altman acknowledges that the film didn't work but is quick to defend the cast, which included Tanner star Cynthia Nixon, saying it was \\"not their fault.\\" Reception The film received generally lackluster reviews.Rotten Tomatoes Related Works Alan Moore's comic characters D.R. and Quinch are a science fiction take on the magazine's O.C. and Stiggs characters.

Founded in 1928, The Little is one of the oldest active movie theaters built specifically to show films in the US, serving as an alternative venue for cinema of higher artistic caliber than what was popular at the time. To remain in business, The Little has created a unique theater experience for its patrons strikingly different from that of standard commercial cinemas. The Little typically shows films that never make it to the large theater chains, either due to lack of publicity, popularity, exposure, or content that is too risky and/or inappropriate for larger audiences (such as NC-17 rated films). Foreign films, independent films, some documentary films and art films are its common fare. The Little is unique in the area in treating anime films as artistic cinema, and titles by the likes of Hayao Miyazaki always find their way to The Little's screens. Critics at The Little provide a synopsis of any film they intend to show, both on their website and posted around their ticket booths on the street. The Little also offers live musical performances from local musicians, a rotating art gallery of local artists, and a cafe. Additionally, The Little serves as a performance venue during the Rochester International Jazz Festival each June. The Little is also the home of the Little Theatre Film Society, a group of theater aficionados in the Rochester area. The Little survives largely due to the hard work and dedication of the society's members. The theater is currently operated with the participation of the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council, a non-profit community organization which owns and operates the region's principal public radio and television stations. The Little has become part of Rochester's extensive theater culture. Rochester has a rich history in cinema, being the home of the Eastman Kodak company and the George Eastman Museum. Kodak film was historically used in a majority of motion pictures (and still is today), creating close ties to the movie industry in Rochester society. The Little Theatre Film Society holds film festivals throughout the year, many of them hosted at The Little. The theatre is well known by any serious cinema patron in Rochester for providing an alternative to standard Hollywood commercial fare. The Little has also avoided the negative reputation for snobbishness that is sometimes associated with art house cinema, cultivating the image of a venue for anyone who is simply seeking an alternative or a community that celebrates cinema. The word \\"Theatre\\" is often used instead of the word \\"Theater\\" to distinguish between art house cinemas and the more common variety. Theatre is an older form of the word, though both words share the same literal meaning. The Little uses the older form both to make this distinction and due to the age of the theater itself.

It was the first generation of gateways, which are known today as routers.IMP -- Interface Message Processor, LivingInternet Accessed June 22, 2007.Looking back at the ARPANET effort, 34 years later, Dave Walden, Accessed June 22, 2007.A Technical History of the ARPANET - A Technical Tour , THINK Protocols team, Accessed June 22, 2007. An IMP was a ruggedized Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer with special-purpose interfaces and software. In later years the IMPs were made from the non-ruggedized Honeywell 316 which could handle two- thirds of the communication traffic at approximately one-half the cost. An IMP requires the connection to a host computer via a special bit-serial interface, defined in BBN Report 1822. The IMP software and the ARPA network communications protocol running on the IMPs was discussed in RFC 1, the first of a series of standardization documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). History IMP Team (Left to Right): Truett Thatch, Bill Bartell (Honeywell), Dave Walden, Jim Geisman, Robert Kahn, Frank Heart, Ben Barker, Marty Thorpe, Will Crowther, and Severo Ornstein Not pictured: Bernie Cosell The concept of an \\"Interface computer\\" was first developed in 1966 by Donald Davies for the NPL network in England. The same idea was independently developed in early 1967 at a meeting of principal investigators for the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to discuss interconnecting machines across the country. Larry Roberts, who led the ARPANET implementation, initially proposed a network of host computers. Wes Clark suggested inserting \\"a small computer between each host computer and the network of transmission lines\\", i.e. making the IMP a separate computer. The IMPs were built by the Massachusetts-based company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) in 1969. BBN was contracted to build four IMPs, the first being due at UCLA by Labor Day; the remaining three were to be delivered in one-month intervals thereafter, completing the entire network in a total of twelve months. When Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy learned of BBN's accomplishment in signing this million-dollar agreement, he sent a telegram congratulating the company for being contracted to build the \\"Interfaith Message Processor\\". The team working on the IMP called themselves the \\"IMP Guys\\": * Team Leader: Frank Heart * Software: Willy Crowther, Dave Walden, Bernie Cosell and Paul Wexelblat * Hardware: Severo Ornstein, Ben Barker * Theory and collaboration with the above on the overall system design: Bob Kahn * Other: Hawley Rising * Added to IMP team later: Marty Thrope (hardware), Jim Geisman, Truett Thach (installation), Bill Bertell (Honeywell) BBN began programming work in February 1969 on modified Honeywell DDP-516s. The completed code was six thousand words long, and was written in the Honeywell 516 assembly language. The IMP software was produced primarily on a PDP-1, where the IMP code was written and edited, then run on the Honeywell. BBN designed the IMP simply as \\"a messenger\\" that would only \\"store-and-forward\\". BBN designed only the host-to-IMP specification, leaving host sites to build individual host-to-host interfaces. The IMP had an error-control mechanism that discarded packets with errors without acknowledging receipt; the source IMP, upon not receiving an acknowledging receipt, would subsequently re-send a duplicate packet. Based on the requirements of ARPA's request for proposal, the IMP used a 24-bit checksum for error correction. BBN chose to make the IMP hardware calculate the checksum, because it was a faster option than using a software calculation. The IMP was initially conceived as being connected to one host computer per site, but at the insistence of researchers and students from the host sites, each IMP was ultimately designed to connect to multiple host computers. The first IMP was delivered to Leonard Kleinrock's group at UCLA on August 30, 1969. It used an SDS Sigma-7 host computer. Douglas Engelbart's group at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) received the second IMP on October 1, 1969. It was attached to an SDS-940 host. The third IMP was installed in University of California, Santa Barbara on November 1, 1969. The fourth and final IMP was installed in the University of Utah in December 1969. The first communication test between two systems (UCLA and SRI) took place on October 29, 1969, when a login to the SRI machine was attempted, but only the first two letters could be transmitted. The SRI machine crashed upon reception of the 'g' character. A few minutes later, the bug was fixed and the login attempt was successfully completed. BBN developed a program to test the performance of the communication circuits. According to a report filed by Heart, a preliminary test in late 1969 based on a 27-hour period of activity on the UCSB-SRI line found \\"approximately one packet per 20,000 in error;\\" subsequent tests \\"uncovered a 100% variation in this number - apparently due to many unusually long periods of time (on the order of hours) with no detected errors.\\" A variant of the IMP existed, called the TIP, which connected terminals as well as computers to the network; it was based on the Honeywell 316, a later version of the 516. Later, some Honeywell-based IMPs were replaced with multiprocessing BBN Pluribus IMPs, but ultimately BBN developed a microprogrammed clone of the Honeywell machine. IMPs were at the heart of the ARPANET until DARPA decommissioned the ARPANET in 1989. Most IMPs were either taken apart, junked or transferred to MILNET. Some became artifacts in museums; Kleinrock placed IMP Number One on public view at UCLA. The last IMP on the ARPANET was the one at the University of Maryland. The front panel of first IMP, taken at the opening of the Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive BBN Report 1822 BBN Report 1822 specifies the method for connecting a host computer to an IMP. This connection and protocol is generally referred to as 1822, the report number. The initial version of the 1822 protocol was developed in 1969: since it predates the OSI model by a decade, 1822 does not map cleanly into the OSI layers. However, it is accurate to say that the 1822 protocol incorporates the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer. The interface visible to the host system passes network layer addresses directly to a physical layer device. To transmit data, the host constructs a message containing the numeric address of another host on the network (similar to an IP address on the Internet) and a data field, and transmits the message across the 1822 interface to the IMP. The IMP routes the message to the destination host using protocols that were eventually adopted by Internet routers. Messages could store a total length of 8159 bits, of which the first 96 were reserved for the header (\\"leader\\").BBN Report 1822, Specifications for the interconnection of a host and a IMP While packets transmitted across the Internet are assumed to be unreliable, 1822 messages were guaranteed to be transmitted reliably to the addressed destination. If the message could not be delivered, the IMP sent to the originating host a message indicating that the delivery failed. In practice, however, there were (rare) conditions under which the host could miss a report of a message being lost, or under which the IMP could report a message as lost when it had in fact been received. Later versions of the 1822 protocol, such as 1822L, are described in RFC 802 and its successors.

In its earliest known uses, it was related to the word for change and was probably cognate with changeling. Since at least the 19th century, it has referred to the offspring of an incubus, succubus, or demon with a human.  History  The word cambion appeared on an early first century AD inscription in Gaul (Roman France). Linguist Benjamin W. Forston IV opines that: William of Auvergne, in his 13th-century work De Universo, wrote of \\"cambiones, from cambiti, that is 'having been exchanged'\\" - the \\"sons of incubi demons\\" substituted for human babies. These infants constantly wail for milk and cannot be satisfied even by four nurses. Richard Firth Green notes that this \\"was to become the standard scholastic explanation for changelings throughout the Middle Ages.\\" The earliest evidenced appearance of the word \\"cambion\\" in the sense of an offspring of two demons is in the 1818 French-Language Dictionnaire Infernal. The 1825 edition of that book has the following entry: English translation: In the Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology the cambion is again said to be the direct offspring of the incubus and the succubus, foregoing any need for human involvement. This same incarnation retained the absence of breath or a pulse until seven years of age, but was said to also have been incredibly heavy (even too heavy for a horse to carry) and to have cried upon being touched.Spence, Lewis (2000). \\"Cambions\\". In the Gale Group's Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, p. 148\\\\. . Since at least the 19th century, \\"cambion\\" has taken on a further definition: the child of an incubus or a succubus with a human parent. In 1874, Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea defined a cambion as the son of a woman and the devil. It also appeared as a hybrid of human and demon in Dungeons and Dragon's 1983 Monster Manual II.  Human-demon hybrids  The concept of offspring born to humans and demons was a subject of debate in the Middle Ages. The influential Malleus Maleficarum, which has been described as the major compendium of literature in demonology of the fifteenth century, states that demons, including the incubus and the succubus, are incapable of reproduction: Because of this inability to create or nurture life, the method of the creation of a cambion is necessarily protracted. A succubus will have sex with a human male and so acquire a sample of his sperm. This she will then pass on to an incubus. The incubus will, in his turn, transfer the sperm to a human female and thus impregnate her. The text goes on to discuss at great length the arguments for and against this process being possible, citing a number of Biblical quotations and noted scholars in support of its arguments, and finally concludes that this is indeed the method used by such demons.

The Americans sought to plunder ammunition and stores to resupply their own forces. Gananoque was a key point in the supply chain between Montreal and Kingston, the main base of the Provincial Marine on the Great Lakes. Under the command of Captain Benjamin Forsyth, the Americans departed Ogdensburg, New York and sailed to Gananoque, where they encountered resistance from the 2nd Regiment of Leeds Militia. The British militia was forced to retreat and the Americans successfully destroyed the storehouse and returned to the United States with captured supplies. As a result of the raid, the British strengthened their defences along the St. Lawrence River. Background Sackets Harbor running low on supplies and ammunition, Brig Gen Jacob Brown authorized a raid into Canadian territory. Gananoque is located roughly from Kingston, the principal base of the British Provincial Marine on the Great Lakes and a key transshipment point. Gananoque served as a depot for ammunition, stores, foodstuffs along the St. Lawrence River route between Kingston and Montreal. Furthermore, it was the last convoy-staging point between Montreal and Kingston and a key point for communications between the two cities. The town had been settled in 1789 by Joel Stone, an American Loyalist who had arrived in Upper Canada following the American Revolutionary War. On 9 August 1812, General Sir George Pr√©vost, commander of British forces in Canada and Major General Henry Dearborn commander of the United States forces in the north agree to a cessation of hostilities. President James Madison repudiated Dearborn's agreement on 15 August. The American garrison at Sackets Harbor, New York under the command of Brigadier General Jacob Brown of the New York Militia was suffering from lack of supply. Brown himself had purchased blankets for his men. The garrison was reinforced by a company of the US Regiment of Riflemen on 14 September, but the reinforcements lacked ammunition. Finding no support from his superiors, Brown authorized a raid on Canadian territory to acquire supplies and ammunition following the termination of the armistice. Based on the intelligence that Brown had, Gananoque was lightly defended. Attack Brown ordered the attack on Gananoque to be led by Captain Benjamin Forsyth of the Regiment of Riflemen. He was to take his company of 90 men and 20 members of the New York Militia under Captain Samuel McNitt and seize stores and ammunition. The force departed from Ogdensburg, New York on 18 September in boats and sailed to Gananoque, arriving on 21 September 1813. Forsyth landed his men west of Gananoque at Sheriff's Point and moved towards the town. The Americans surprised the 2nd Regiment of the Leeds Militia under the command of Colonel Joel Stone. The American force was spotted by two British dragoons approaching the town and upon their arrival were met by 100 Leeds Militia under the command of Lieutenant Levi Soper which began firing. Forsyth moved his force to within of the Leeds Militia, and opened fire. He then ordered a charge, which drove the British militia back over a bridge. Forsyth's troops entered Gananoque and commandeered 3,000 ball cartridges and 41 muskets, while destroying 150 barrels of provisions, ransacking the storehouse and destroying the home of Colonel Stone. The Americans had one killed and ten wounded, while the British suffered eight killed, eight taken as prisoners of war and others wounded, including Colonel Stone's wife. Thirty minutes after landing, the Americans returned to their boats with their plunder and set off for Ogdensburg. Aftermath A British party was sent to intercept Forsyth but failed to locate his force. The British party then landed at Burton's Point and burned a blockhouse and several boats before returning to Canada. Forsyth relocated his command to Ogdensburg and on 7 February 1813, raided again across the border, this time at Elizabethtown. The British replied with their own raid on Ogdensburg. The British acknowledged the threat to their supply lines and began transporting their equipment and troops in escorted convoys. Construction of a blockhouse began at Ganonoque in January 1813 and was finished later in the year. Historic plaque To mark the site, an Ontario provincial plaque was installed on the grounds of the Gananoque Power Company.

M√∂venpick Hotels & Resorts  The official launch of M√∂venpick Hotels & Resorts was marked by the opening of two hotels at Zurich Airport and Zurich-Regensdorf. Expansion beyond Europe started in 1976 with the opening in Cairo of the M√∂venpick Hotel Jolie Ville. M√∂venpick Hotels & Resorts were among the first companies to operate hotels under management contracts, which helped allow rapid growth. Expansion continued through the 1980s into Egypt, with the chain‚Äôs first cruise ship (HS Radamis) beginning operations in 1991.

IL 255 starts at I-270 in Pontoon Beach and ends at U.S. Route 67 (US 67) in Godfrey, at a total length of approximately . It was constructed in four segments opening from 1998 to 2012 at a total cost of $165.2 million. Route description IL 255 is a four-lane, limited-access freeway for its entire length. It serves as an important circumferential artery for the northeastern portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area. The final segment‚Äî from Seminary Road to US 67 in Godfrey, just north of the intersection of US 67 and Montclaire Avenue (IL 267/IL 111)‚Äîwas opened on November 23, 2012. The highway passes just to the west of the St. Louis Regional Airport and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Although IL 255 was designed to federal Interstate Highway standards, it was built by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) using state-provided funds. History Described as \\"the Road to Prosperity\\" by business leaders and government officials who initially proposed it in the late 1970s, IL 255 was part of a region-wide effort to create a high-speed alternative to US 67 over the Clark Bridge through the city-center of Alton, and to two congested local routes (IL 3 and IL 111) that roughly parallel the IL 255 corridor. Although it was part of the much larger Corridor 413 plan, the local politicians focused mostly on the segment from I-270 to what was then IL 267 north of the Godfrey \\"Y\\" intersection. At that time, the Berm Highway, the Beltline extension, and the Madison Avenue connector were not built and both IL 3 and IL 111 were over capacity between Alton and I-270. In 1975, a six-month detour related with the closing of the Old Clark Bridge exposed the need for the Alton Bypass along with the other three routes. However, until 1985, the Alton Bypass was a low priority, as other local road projects in the area were considered more important. The roadway was constructed in four segments opening from 1998 to 2012 at a total cost of $165.2 million. The first segment, from I-270 to IL 143, was completed in October 1998 at the cost of $40 million (excluding land acquisition). The second segment, a extension from IL 143 to Fosterburg Road was constructed for $78.1 million and opened on October 20, 2006, approximately one year behind schedule, owing to the 2005 collapse of the Wisconsin-based construction company that held the contracts for that portion of the roadway. The $25.1 million third segment opened on August 22, 2008 and extended the road from Fosterburg Road to Seminary Road. The fourth and final segment opened on November 23, 2012 and extended the road from Seminary Road to US 67 in Godfrey, just north of the intersection of US 67 and Montclaire Avenue (IL 267/IL 111) at a cost of $22 million.

Zen and Daoist meditators attempt to reach this state, as well as artists and trained martial artists.A Dictionary of the Martial Arts. Louis Frederic (author), Paul H Crompton (editor). 2006.

Etymology The term contains the character for negation, \\"not\\" or \\"without\\" (ÁÑ°), along with the character for heart-mind (ÂøÉ). The term is shortened from , a Zen expression meaning the mind without mind and is also referred to as the state of \\"no- mindness\\". That is, a mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. It is translated by D.T. Suzuki as \\"being free from mind-attachment\\".Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Manual Of Zen Buddhism, p. 80, http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/manual_zen.pdf Description Mushin is achieved when a person's mind is free from thoughts of anger, fear, or ego during combat or everyday life. There is an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act and react towards an opponent without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts. At this point, a person relies not on what they think should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is felt intuitively. It is not a state of relaxed, near-sleepfulness, however. The mind could be said to be working at a very high speed, but with no intention, plan or direction. Some masters believe that mushin is the state where a person finally understands the uselessness of techniques and becomes truly free to move. In fact, those people will no longer even consider themselves as \\"fighters\\" but merely living beings moving through space. On page 84 of his 1979 book Zen in the Martial Arts, Joe Hyams claimed Bruce Lee read the following quote to him, attributed to the legendary Zen master Takuan S≈çh≈ç:Hyams, Joe. Zen in the Martial Arts. New York: Bantam Books, 1979. > The mind must always be in the state of 'flowing,' for when it stops > anywhere that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that > is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it > means death. > When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the > opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. He just stands > there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to > follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the > wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in > the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes. Applications However, mushin is not just a state of mind that can be achieved during combat. Many martial artists train to achieve this state of mind during kata so that a flawless execution of moves is learned and may be repeated at any other time. Once mushin is attained through the practice or study of martial arts (although it can be accomplished through other arts or practices that refine the mind and body), the objective is to then attain this same level of complete awareness in other aspects of the practitioner's life.

Nf3 Nc6 :3. Bc4 Nd4 It is also sometimes referred to as the Kostiƒá Gambit after the Serbian grandmaster Borislav Kostiƒá, who played it in the early 20th century.Bill Wall (2005), The Blackburne Shilling Gambit History Wilhelm Steinitz made the first known mention of this line, noting it in 1895 in the Addenda to his Modern Chess Instructor, Part II.Wilhelm Steinitz, The Modern Chess Instructor, Edition Olms Z√ºrich, 1990 (reprint), p. 63 of Part II. . The earliest game with the opening on chessgames.com, Dunlop‚ÄìHicks, New Zealand Championship, dates from 1911. Another early game, mentioned by Bill Wall, is Muhlock‚ÄìKostiƒá, Cologne, 1912. The beginning 4.Nxe5 \\"continues to catch victims, including two in successive rounds at Blackpool 1987\\". Analysis Black's third move is a weak, time-wasting move. Steinitz recommended 4.0-0 or 4.Nxd4 in response. International Master Jeremy Silman writes that White has an advantage after 4.0-0 (Paul Keres gives 4.0-0 d6 5.Nxd4 exd4 6.c3 \\"with the better position\\".), 4.c3, or 4.Nc3. He recommends as best 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.c3 d5 6.exd5 Qe7+ 7.Kf1 . If 5...dxc3, White has the initiative in the after 6.Nxc3 d6 7.d4 ; if 5...Bc5, Black loses a pawn to 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 7.Qh5+ (Wolfgang Unzicker). The only virtue of 3...Nd4 is that it sets a trap that has ensnared many players. After the natural 4.Nxe5!?, Black wins with 4...Qg5! Now the obvious 5.Nxf7 loses to 5...Qxg2 6.Rf1 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 Nf3, a smothered mate. This trap is what gives the line its name; the great English master Joseph Henry Blackburne reputedly used it to win one shilling per game from caf√© visitors. Wall has questioned this, however, stating that there are no recorded games of Blackburne with the opening. The opening is not a true gambit, since White cannot take the pawn on e5 without losing material; however, after 4.Nxe5 Qg5, White can maintain a playable game with 5.Bxf7+! Steinitz wrote that this move, \\"followed by castling, is now White's best chance and in some measure a promising one, considering that he has two Pawns and the attack for the piece\\". G. Chandler‚Äì, Stockbridge 1983, continued 5...Ke7 (5...Kd8 is better) 6.0-0 Qxe5 7.Bxg8 Rxg8 8.c3 Nc6 (Silman analyzes 9...Qf6 10.f4 when \\"[w]ith two pawns and an attack for the sacrificed piece, White‚Äôs compensation isn‚Äôt in doubt\\".) 9.d4 ( Keres) Qa5? 10.d5 Ne5? 11.Qh5! Nf7? 12.d6+! (in light of 13.Qxa5). Graham Burgess writes that 3...Nd4 is also known as the \\"Oh my God!\\" trap, as for full effect, Black is supposed to make this exclamation, pretending to have accidentally blundered the e-pawn. Burgess condemns this behavior as unethical, and notes that the trap, if avoided, leaves White with a large advantage.Graham Burgess, The Mammoth Book of Chess, Carroll & Graf, 1997, pp. 122‚Äì23. .

The team lasted 16 years, under the sponsorship of 7-Eleven through 1990 and then Motorola from 1990 through 1996. From 1989 to 1996 it rode on Eddy Merckx bikes. History Davis Phinney, Team 7-Eleven rider, corners on Greg LeMond's left during the Fisherman's Wharf Criterium stage of the 1986 Coors Classic in San Francisco, CA. 7-Eleven was formed as an amateur cycling team in 1981 by Ochowicz, a 29-year-old former Olympic cyclist from the U.S., who was married to Olympic speed skating gold medalist Sheila Young. Ochowicz had managed the U.S. national speed-skating team and was friends with Eric and Beth Heiden, who were both excellent cyclists as well as champion speed skaters.Dzierzak, Lou. The Evolution of American Bicycle Racing. Velikost; 2007; pp. 82-83. He managed to get sponsorship from the Southland Corporation, owners of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain, and bicycle manufacturer Schwinn to form an amateur team. Of the seven men on the inaugural 7-Eleven-Schwinn team racing in 1981, Eric Heiden (who swept the gold medals in speed skating in the 1980 Winter Olympics) was the captain and the best known. The other Americans were Jeff Bradley, Greg Demgen, Bradley Davies, Tom Schuler, Danny Van Haute and Roger Young (Ochowicz's brother-in- law). They were joined by Canadian Ron Hayman. Although Schwinn dropped out as a co-sponsor in 1982, 7-Eleven added a women's team with Rebecca Twigg, among others, as well as more male riders, including Davis Phinney, Ron Kiefel and Canadian Alex Stieda.Dzierzak, p. 83. The all-amateur 7-Eleven team was featured in the 1985 movie American Flyers, starring Kevin Costner. The 1986 Cycling Media Guide published for the 1986 World Championships lists Jeff Bradley, Chris Carmichael, Alexi Grewal, Eric Heiden, Ron Kiefel, Davis Phinney, Bob Roll, Tom Schuler, Doug Shapiro and Alex Stieda with an additional group of amateur men on the team including Frankie Andreu, Curt Harnett, David Lettieri, Robert Mathis, Leonard \\"Harvey\\" Nitz and Russell Scott. Southland continued its commitment by sponsoring the cycling venue at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where nine Americans won cycling medals. The other (especially equipment) sponsors of the team included Descente, Huffy, Campagnolo, and Tag Heuer. Often, those sponsors elected not to continue after their initial contracts were completed. In 1985, Ochowitz changed the men's team's status to professional and asked Mike Neel to be the directeur sportif in Europe. The team went to Europe with an initial roster of members including Olympic gold medalists Alexi Grewal and Heiden, Olympic bronze medalists Phinney and Kiefel, Bradley, Schuler, Hayman, Stieda, and Chris Carmichael. When the team received an invitation to the 1985 Giro d'Italia, one of the Grand Tours of Europe, a young American cyclist based in Europe named Andrew Hampsten was added to the team under a 30-day contract for the race. After both Kiefel and Hampsten stunningly won stages during the Giro, becoming the first American stage winners ever at a Grand Tour, 7-Eleven was invited to the 1986 Tour de France and became one of the major cycling teams for the next decade, under the sponsorship of Southland through 1990 and then Motorola through 1996. Ochowicz disbanded the team after the 1996 season, when Motorola decided to discontinue sponsorship.Dzierzak, pp. 84-85. While it was not the first professional cycling team in the U.S., 7-Eleven was responsible for an overall increase in bike racing interest in the U.S. The team claimed a win in a Grand Tour, when Andrew Hampsten won the general classification as well as the mountains classification at the 1988 Giro d'Italia (Tour of Italy). It also claimed a handful of world championship medals and US championships, as well as Tour de France and Giro stage wins and one more Grand Tour podium (Hampsten's third in the 1989 Giro d'Italia). It was the second U.S. team to ride the Giro d'Italia (1985) (the Gianni Motta team was the first in 1984) and in the Tour de France (1986), where two Canadian riders on the team held the yellow jersey on different occasions (Alex Stieda in 1986 and Steve Bauer in 1990). Its Tour de France stage winners included Phinney, Jeff Pierce, Hampsten, Sean Yates and Dag Otto Lauritzen from Norway. In 1989 Brian Walton won the pro-am Milk Race (Tour of Britain). As of 2009, Team 7-Eleven is the only cycling team to have been inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame. =Bike sponsor= Three bike manufacturers sponsored the team throughout the years: Schwinn from 1981 to 1984, Murray from 1985 to 1986, Huffy from 1987 to 1988, although the team bikes from 1985 to 1988 were primarily built by Ben Serotta. Finally Eddy Merckx sponsored the team from 1989 through their ultimate cessation in 1996. For Eddy Merckx, sponsoring the American team had a special meaning.

Velopress, USA. p.XI-XII =Race radios= During Motorola's sponsorship of the team in the 1990s, the riders began communicating with the team cars through the use of two-way radios built by Motorola. The radios were slowly adopted through the rest of the professional peloton, becoming standard equipment by 2002.

Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. 2009 (24 Feb 2009) The first recorded contact between the Iowa and Europeans was in 1676, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where they lived among the Ho-Chunk people. Traditionally, Iowa society was divided into two moieties, the Buffalo and the Bear clans, who would govern the tribe on an alternating, semiannual basis. In face of European-American encroachment, the Iowa moved east in what is now Iowa and Missouri, but in 1839 the tribe ceded their lands and moved to the Ioway Reservation on the Kansas-Nebraska border. There factionalism broke out between the mixed blood and full blood Iowas. The mixed bloods advocated assimilation, while the full bloods wanted to follow their traditional way of life. In the attempt to preserve their traditions, the full blood faction of the Iowa Tribe began moving into Indian Territory in 1878. They were given lands within the Sac and Fox Reservation in 1883. Their collective tribal landholdings were broken up by the Dawes Act and, in 1890, individual land was allotted by the Cherokee Commission to 109 tribal members. The Curtis Act of 1898 dismantled tribal government, but the tribe was able to reorganize under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936, as the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. They ratified a constitution and by-laws in 1937.

In the 17th century, Iowa people lived in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. During the 1820s and 1830s, the tribe signed numerous treaties with the US federal government and were assigned a reservation near the Great Nemaha River near the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska border in 1836. In the 1870s, the tribe split into two groups, and the Southern Ioway moved to Indian Territory, while the Northern Ioway remained in Kansas and Nebraska. They ratified their constitution and by-laws on February 26, 1937. During the period from the 1940s to the 1960s, in which the Indian termination policy was enforced, four Kansas tribes, including the Iowa, were targeted for termination. One of the first pieces of legislation enacted during this period was the Kansas Act of 1940 which transferred all jurisdiction for crimes committed on or against Indians from federal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas. It did not preclude the federal government from trying Native people, but it allowed the state into an area of law in which had historically belonged only to the federal government. On 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.US Statutes at Large 67:B132 A memo issued by the Department of the Interior on 21 January 1954 clarified that the reference to \\"Potawatomi\\" in the Resolution meant the Potawatomi, the Kickapoo, the Sac and Fox, and the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska tribes in Kansas. Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the Kansas Act of 1940, the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination. In February 1954, joint hearings for the Kansas tribes were held by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs. The Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation tribal leader, Minnie Wishkeno Evans (Indian name: Ke-wat-no- quah)http://genealogytrails.com/kan/butler/1927potawatomiindians.htmlhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96078296 led the effort to stop termination. Tribal members sent petitions of protest to the government and multiple delegations went to testify at congressional meetings in Washington, DC.http://www.pbpindiantribe.com/tribal-history.aspx Tribal Council members Vestana Cadue, Oliver Kahbeah, and Ralph Simon of the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas traveled at their own expense to testify as well. The strong opposition from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes helped them, as well as the Sac and Fox and the Iowa Tribe, avoid termination. 21st century In March 2016, the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska filed a motion to consult with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) regarding their permit for Dakota Energy to build the Bakken pipeline, which will run through the tribe's ancestral lands.

The device consists of a thin, taut metal wire, often made of nichrome or stainless steel, or a thicker wire preformed into a desired shape, which is heated via electrical resistance to approximately . As the wire is passed through the material to be cut, the heat from the wire vaporises the material just in advance of contact. The depth of the cut is limited only by the wire length. Width of cut is limited by throat, if any. Types of wire used * Preformed, manually or with pliers. * Tensioned, held tight by a frame with springs or (equivalently) by a bow. Many indicate a preference for single-strand stainless steel wire over nichrome wire, in diameters ranging from to for frame-tensioned cutters. Musical instrument strings and leader wire used for fishing lures are readily available and inexpensive. Commercial cutting equipment often uses the nickel- based alloy wire Rene 41, a high-strength alloy which maintains most of its tensile strength at cutting temperatures. Foams suitable for hot-wire cutting All thermofusible expanded foams. This means those materials that melt at a relatively low temperature: * Expanded polystyrene (blocks of expanded white balls). * Extruded polystyrene (in blue, green, gray, pink or purple smooth plates, depending on the manufacturer). * Polymethacrylimide low density rigid foam (Rohacell), excellent mechanical properties but very expensive. * Flexible expanded polypropylene foams, ideal for shock protecting. * Polyethylene foams, flexible and tear resistant. * Custom materials, such as the foams used in flexible fuel tanks to reduce explosion risks. Types of cutters=Preformed wire= A preformed wire is attached to a handle. The operator manually guides the wire through the foam to cut freeform shapes. =Tensioned wire=Handheld A short tensioned wire is attached to a handle. The operator manually guides the wire through the foam to cut freeform shapes. Simple manual table Simple hot wire foam cutting table Hot wire foam cutting tables can use a vertical or a horizontal wire, usually with a horizontal table used as a guide or for securing the foam work piece. A table with a vertical wire is mainly used by hobbyists to cut small and complex shapes such as letters. Only prismatic members can be cut on this type of table. Tables with horizontal wires are heavily used in construction and packaging. The cutting wire is attached to tracks on either side of the table enabling it to be moved up and down making cuts very exact. This table type can also perform angular cuts. Template-guided manual table A horizontal-wire manual table that uses templates placed on each side of a foam block to guide a taut hot wire to form a prismatic or tapered shape. The hot wire, tensioned with a bow or by springs attached to a rigid frame, can be propelled through the foam by hand or with a cord and pulley mechanism connecting each end of the hot wire to a weight. This method is widely employed by hobbyists to produce foam cores for model airplane wings. Template-guided cutter accuracy is highly dependent on operator skill at fixturing the foam and guiding the hot wire along the templates. Accuracy is also affected by the precision to which the templates are formed and proper assessment and handling of kerf. Push through slicer A vertical or near horizontal frame contains a set of evenly spaced parallel tensioned cutting wires. Massive blocks of foam are pushed through the frame on rollers or by gravity, thus slicing them into sheets that are sold as \\"bead-boards\\" for general use in construction work etc. The blocks are guided so little skill is needed by the operator. The frame holding the wires is often a replaceable and or adjustable unit so the spacing can be changed. This allows a range of plate thicknesses and sizes to be produced without the cost of expensive molds for each size, as the blocks are made in standard \\"block form\\" machines that produce blocks of industry standard sizes (such as 0.5 x 1 x 2 m). To produce plates shorter than the usual length of the massive blocks, the blocks are simply pre-cut to the desired length before slicing. This method is a common way of making the EPS (Styrofoam/Styropor) sheets used in construction. Computer numerically controlled Computer numerical controlled (CNC) stages on each side of a block of foam guide a tensioned hot wire to form a prismatic or tapered shape. This is a four degree of freedom CNC system (one each X and Y on each side of the foam block). Accuracy is affected by the precision of the stepper motors, backlash of drive systems, and stiffness of the races supporting the end effectors which hold the tensioned wire. Some CNC hot-wire cutters offer lathe attachments, which can be used with either stretched or preformed wire. Lathe attachments allow cutting of spiral shapes, and are often used to create concrete forms for ornamental and structural items, such as planters and stairway balusters and newels. Workmanship considerations=Wire length limits= The practical limit to the length of a tensioned cutting wire is the tendency of the wire to sag under the force of gravity, which requires higher tension for longer wires. Some CNC cutting machines place the ends of the wire above and below the workpiece, with the wire being mostly vertical, to counter this problem. =Speed and temperature tuning= Cutting speed and wire temperature combine to determine the thickness and consistency of kerf. For a given wire temperature, an attempted motion in excess of the wire's ability to melt the foam can lead to wire drag and poor surface finish of the cut foam. Conversely, dwelling in the foam any longer than strictly required to melt the cut path can lead to excessively thick kerf. A nonuniform feed rate can lead to a kerf of varying thickness.

Retrieved May 29, 2012. They were previously known as the Sheep Ranch Rancheria or the Sheep Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indian of California. The California Valley Miwok are Sierra Miwok, an indigenous people of California. Government The tribe conducts business from Stockton, California. The current tribal administration is: * Silvia Burley, Chairperson * Anjelica Paulk, Vice- Chairperson * Rashel Reznor, Secretary/Treasurer According to the tribe's website, it is currently governed by a tribal/general council that meets monthly. Officers are elected for six-year terms, with the tribe electing a vice chairperson in 2015 and both a chairperson and a secretary/treasurer in 2017. History Membership of the tribe was very low throughout the 20th century. In 1916, the federal government purchased at Sheep Ranch, California for the benefit of 12 named members of the tribe. They were described by the Indian agent who arranged the purchase as \\"the remnant of once quite a large band of Indians in former years living in or near the old decaying mining town known and designated on the map as 'Sheepranch' \\". In 1935, the only Indian recorded as living on the rancher√≠a was Jeff Davis. Davis was recorded as voting in favor of the Indian Reorganization Act on June 8, 1912. By 1966, Mabel Hodge Dixie was identified as the only adult member of the tribe living on the rancher√≠a. The Bureau of Indian Affairs developed a plan to distribute the tribe's assets to her that year under the 1958 California Rancheria Act, but never declared the tribe terminated or treated it as such. In 1994, Mabel's son Yakima Dixie identified himself as \\"the only descendant and ... recognized member of the Tribe.\\" Legal and membership disputes since 1999 From the late-1990s there was a long-running dispute over the government, membership and status of the California Valley Miwok Tribe. On August 5, 1998, Yakima Dixie accepted Silvia Burley as a member of the tribe, along with her two daughters and granddaughter. Burley provided information tracing her ancestry to Jeff Davis, who had been listed as the only member of the tribe in a 1913 census; she had contacted Dixie at the suggestion of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. At the time of Burley's admission in 1998, the tribe was not \\"organized\\" as defined by the Indian Reorganization Act, and the BIA recommended that, given its small size, the tribe should form a general council, a simpler structure than formal organization. A general council of all adult citizens was formed on November 5, 1998, and by late 1999 a dispute had arisen between Burley and Dixie. Between 1999 and 2010, each party appealed to the BIA to support its view and to intervene on the grounds that the other had not involved the \\"whole tribal community\\" of both enrolled citizens and potentially enrolled citizens. For much of this period, the BIA took the view that it had a duty to intervene in the tribe's affairs on behalf of potentially enrolled citizens of the tribe. In this respect, the BIA became the adjudicator between the claims of the competing parties, determining which decisions were valid and which members constituted the tribe's government. In a December 22, 2010 decision, the BIA completely reversed its opinion, deciding that it had no obligation to represent the interests of potentially enrolled tribe members, and that therefore the BIA was free to wash its hands of involvement. the BIA advised the parties that, \\"continuing this imprudent dispute risks potential adverse consequences well beyond the Tribe and its descendants\\". The BIA noted that \\"it is equitably appropriate for the CVMT to reach out to potential citizens...\\" but that it is not a duty of the federal government to impose this requirement on the tribe. This decision was reaffirmed by Larry Echo Hawk, assistant secretary of Indian Affairs, in a detailed letter to the parties on August 31, 2011. The California Gambling Control Commission made distributions to the tribe worth $1.1 million per year from the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund from July 2000 through August 2005. Following the BIA's intervention in the tribe's affairs, the CGCC decided to cease distributions to the California Valley Miwok Tribe and instead to hold them in trust. In a 2007 letter, the commission told the tribe it would release the funds after the BIA recognized the governing body and the tribe resolved its leadership dispute. However, the funds were not released following the 2011 BIA decision to recognize Burley as the tribe's chair, prompting Burley to sue the commission in state and federal courts. A non- member of the tribe, Chadd Everone, who describes himself as a \\"deputy and consul general\\" for Yakima Dixie, has countersued to prevent distribution of the funds to Burley's group, contending that Dixie never resigned as chair of the tribe. Court filings by Burley's group claim that Everone is manipulating Dixie and wants to use the gaming distributions \\"as security\\" to attract outside investors for a project to build a tribal casino. They allege that Everone intends to bring the tribe under his own control with Dixie as a \\"puppet\\" chair of the tribe.

Ione Miwok oral history says the tribe comes from the Buena Vista Peaks, south of Ione, California, when the Sacramento Valley was covered by water. European contact came in the 19th century, when Spanish explorers descended upon Miwok lands. They enslaved thousands of Indians during the mission system period. Smallpox and other epidemics hit the Miwok between 1820 and 1840, which drastically reduced the Indian population. Before the Spanish first landed on California soil, there were about 22,000 Miwok Indians within the region; today there are about 750.Culture & History, Ione Band of Miwok, Official Website. Retrieved February 21, 2017. John Sutter built his fort in 1839 and continued enslaving Indians. He raided around Ione. The 1848‚Äì50 California Gold Rush brought an onslaught of non-Native people into the region. This massive inflow of people seeking fortune lead to settlers invading their land in the Sierra foothills; many of their hunting and gathering areas were then occupied. This led to extremely violent and even deadly clashes between the immigrants and the Indians. Spurred by the violence created by the newcomers onto indigenous Californians' lands, the United States federal government negotiated three treaties with the Ione Miwok. The US Congress never ratified the treaties, and the public did not learn about them until 1905. They were pushed off their ancestral lands and denied human rights or protection. This forced the Miwok people into homelessness, forced to develop a new lifestyle with means to survive. Some were able to survive by relocating and uniting with neighboring tribes in the Sierra foothills, which created amalgamated (merged groups of Native Americans) or by working as laborers on ranches. A 1915 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) census revealed 101 homeless Miwok people living around Ione. These would become the Jackson Rancheria, Buena Vista Rancheria, and Ione Band of Miwok Indians. The US tried and failed to create a 40-acre Indian rancheria for the Ione Miwok. Families settled on the land, and finally in 1972, the land was awarded to 12 individuals and other members of the Ione Miwok, but not collectively to the tribe. Negotiations and legal struggles over land ownership and tribal recognition continued for decades. In 1994, Ada Deer wrote that the Ione Band of Miwok Indians was in fact recognized by the federal government. The Ione Miwok elected a tribal council in 1996. They ratified a constitution that was approved by the BIA in 2002 and held another election in 2003.

Language The Miwok people lived peacefully for thousand of years throughout large portions of Northern and Central California. Originally, they were constituted of three main groups, which included: the Sierra Miwok, Lake Miwok, and Coast Miwok. Traditional territory of their ancestors included the Sierra Nevada foothills and Central California. The languages they have been classified as speaking are the Nisean language. Northern Miwok and Plains Miwok languages have been grouped in the Penutian language family. Most of them still live in Central California today on ‚ÄúRancherias‚Äù, which are similar to reservations. However, some do not live on the Rancherias, but in intertribal communities where there are members of other tribes, while others reside in Northern California towns. Today, the Miwok people speak English, but in the past they spoke their native ‚ÄúMiwok language‚Äù, also known as Moquelumnan. Some elders still remember words from the language and younger people also take an interest in learning/speaking their native language again. However, overall, it is an endangered language.Culture & History, Ione Band of Miwok Indians, official website Retrieved on February 28, 2017 Culture and economy Traditionally, each Miwok band was led by a chief, who was typically a male. In some bands, chiefdom was hereditary and other clans elders would choose who would be the preceding chief. The Miwok tribe was made up of hunters, gatherers, and fishers. Their diets included acorns that could be made into various dishes such as soups, cakes, and bread. They hunted deer, black bear, elk, fowl, and small game such as rabbits, fish or quail. They also collected a number of foods available to them such as buckeye nuts, berries, mushrooms, and other greens. The weapons they used included spears, slings, knives, clubs, and bows and arrows. Their traditional clothing incorporated loincloths woven from grass or bark fibers and animal hides, fur robes, and kilts during the colder seasons for the men. Women traditionally wore front/back aprons created from the shredded willow bark, and their dresses usually were about calf length decorated with ornaments, tassels, shells, and quills. Like the men, they too wore fur robes in the winter and both genders wore moccasins during the cold weather and men would normally be barefoot if warm enough outside. More ceremonial attire consisted of headdresses, flicker headbands, that were made of the longest and narrowest flicker quill wing feathers. The colors were dark pink or yellow and sewn together with darker brown feathers to create the headband that would be tied from the back. Their styles also included body adornments; most of them wore ear and nose embellishments. They also practiced tattooing and developed the white paint from chalk deposits and the black from charcoal. This resulted in the black and white face and body painting that was often applied in horizontal lines. These tattoos and body adornments made the Miwok tribe very unique and distinctive. In the past, the Miwoks lived in tule houses that were usually made up of cone-shaped frames of wooden poles placed over a hold that is dug into the ground. The frame would be covered by mats woven by tule reeds and were kept insulated by packing dirt over it. Today, they live in modern houses/apartments. The children of the Miwok used to have lots of chores and little time to play. Today they commonly go hunting or fishing with their fathers. Back then, a popular game for free time was ‚Äúshinny‚Äù. This is an athletic game much like rugby and lacrosse. The younger children played a ‚Äúskipping stone‚Äù game, which is similar to the game ‚Äújacks‚Äù. Miwok girls also played with dolls, just like young girls commonly do today. Their culture heavily ties with their sacred ceremonies and beliefs. They commonly prayed and offered thanks to their spirits. They believed everything in the world obtained a spiritual power, such as plants, animals, rocks, and trees. Therefore, they often only took what they needed and did not like to waste anything from their sacred land. They held high respects for animals and showed this through their imitation dances and mythical legends about the animals and their people's connection.War Paths 2 Peace Pipes Website: Miwok Tribe Dancing was very important to them and they performed in many occasions: when giving thanks, celebrating, and also in hopes of curing for the sick as well as prayers for the dead. They had musical instruments that consisted of elderberry flutes, drums, cocoon rattles, clappers, and whistles.Native Americans: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Peoples, Volume 1. Retrieved March 18, 2017. As for economics, Coast and Lake Miwok used clamshell beads. They often traveled west to gather marine sources such as clamshells and seaweed. Today, the Ione Band is still seeking future establishment of a gambling facility (casino) near Plymouth, California. The Ione Band's casino is in support of the tribe's government operations, programs, and general tribal members with the revenue from the casino.

The scrambling route on the north side was first ascended in 1915. Geology The grey rocks exposed in the cliffs on the upper part of Crowsnest Mountain are limestones and shales of Late Devonian to Early Mississippian age (the Palliser at the base, overlain by the Exshaw and Banff, with the Livingstone Formation at the summit). They were moved up from the west along the Lewis thrust fault and emplaced over younger rocks (the Late Cretaceous Belly River Formation) that underlie the wooded lower slopes of the mountain. During that movement they were formed into a broad syncline by fault-bend folding.R.A.Price, 1961. Geological Survey of Canada, Paper 61-24 and Map 35-1961.R.A. Price, 1962.

The organization is dedicated to the preservation and study of the historic role Sweden and Swedish Americans have played in US culture and history. The museum complex includes the Swan Turnblad Mansion, completed in 1910, and the adjoining Nelson Cultural Center, completed in 2012. Today, ASI serves as a gathering place for all people to share experiences around themes of culture, migration, the environment and the arts, informed by enduring links to Sweden. The museum offers exhibitions from Sweden and the Nordic region, programming for youth and family, and in recent years, has expanded its performing arts offerings. The museum's restaurant, FIKA, was named \\"Best Lunch In Minnesota\\" by the Star Tribune in 2013 for its New Nordic cuisine. History The American Swedish Institute is housed in a turn-of-the-20th-century mansion that was built for Swedish immigrants Swan and Christina Turnblad. Swan Turnblad immigrated with his family to the United States in 1868 at the age of eight. His parents made the decision to leave their farm in the famine-ridden area of Sm√•land, Sweden. The family settled in a Swedish community called Vasa in southern Minnesota where they joined relatives who had settled in the area earlier. Swan Turnblad was not content to continue in the family farming tradition. In 1879 Turnblad left Vasa for Minneapolis where he lived the quintessential rags-to-riches American success story. After he moved to Minneapolis, Turnblad worked at several Swedish language newspapers as a typesetter. His interest in the printing industry eventually led to his success as publisher of the Swedish language newspaper Svenska Amerikanska Posten. Within ten years he was the sole owner. Under his management, circulation of the weekly paper soared to over 40,000, a substantial increase from the 1,400 it initially claimed. This publication was likely the principal source of Turnblad's wealth. The success of the paper was a result of Turnblad's aggressive management style, as well as the large numbers of Swedish immigrants who supported it. He created a technically advanced newspaper by using the best printing equipment available. He was the first Swedish publisher in America to set his paper by Linotype machine. In 1903 Svenska Amerikanska Posten became the first Swedish language paper to use a duplex rotary color printing press, enabling the creation of color illustrations. In Minneapolis Swan met and married Christina Nilsson. She, like Turnblad, had come to America from Sweden with her family. Her family settled in Worthington, Minnesota, in 1876 when Christina was 15. Her first job in America paid no wages, but gave her work experience and English language training. Later she worked as a waitress for one year. In 1882 Christina moved to Minneapolis where she met the young newspaper man at a Good Templar meeting. They were married in 1883 and their only child, Lillian Zenobia, was born a year later. In the early 20th century the Turnblads started to plan the building of their palatial estate. Their many trips to Europe certainly influenced their decision on the stately chateau style of the mansion and the ornate designs of the interior. The property on Park Avenue was purchased in 1903 and plans were drawn up by the Minneapolis architectural firm of Christopher A. Boehme and Victor Cordella. The structure took nearly five years to build. The Turnblads did not take out a mortgage on this property during construction. Bills were paid as they came due and there are no records of construction costs. When the museum was founded in 1929, the Minneapolis Tribune reported, \\"the cost is believed to have been close to $1 million although this is a matter the builder does not discuss.\\" The transition from private residence to museum happened in 1929 when the family donated the house and the newspaper to establish the American Institute for Swedish Arts, Literature and Science (later changed to the American Swedish Institute). Turnblad stated that he had long planned for the home to be a Swedish-American institute. He was quoted as saying, \\"many persons may have wondered what a small family like ours, a family which had not great social ambitions, wanted with so big a house. Perhaps they can guess now.\\" The mansion is on the National Register of Historic Places.History of Hennepin County and The City of Minneapolis, 1881. Page 277. North Star Publishing http://hennbios.tripod.com/surnamet.htm It was listed for its local significance in architecture, art, and education. The second floor of the mansion underwent restoration in 1995 to rebuild damaged plaster moldings, and restore their gold leaf and paint to match undamaged regions. The work received a Heritage Preservation Award. The Nelson Cultural Center In 2012, ASI opened a addition designed by HGA Architects of Minneapolis. The addition includes new gallery space, craft workshop, glass-enclosed reception area, gift shop, restaurant (FIKA), and spaces for events such as concerts, lectures, and community gatherings. The addition was dedicated by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden. Exhibits at ASI Exhibits at ASI have included: * The Watercolor Worlds of Lars Lerin - Lars Lerin is a contemporary Nordic artist whose work is described as \\"both impressionistic and highly detailed\\". * Nordic: A Photographic Essay of Landscapes, Food and People - photography from the Michelin Star-winning chef, Magnus Nilsson. * Eight Seasons in S√°pmi, the Land of the S√°mi People - the art and culture of the Sami people from the northernmost regions of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Russia. * Papercut! The Incredible Psaligraphy of Karen Bit Vejle - an exhibit of 54 paper creations. * Nobel Creations - Couture designs from students of Beckmans College of Design, on loan from the Nobel Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. =Annual Christmas exhibit= In the 1950s, ASI began displays that showed how Christmas is celebrated in different Scandinavian countries. This has evolved into an annual display where each room in the mansion is decorated to represent a different country: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark. Recently, the museum has added a \\"guest country\\" to the display with a Navidad room from Mexico in 2014 and a Russian Christmas room in 2015.

The route starts at Arkansas Highway 101 at the Arkansas‚ÄìMissouri state line, and travels northeastward. It travels through the city of Bakersfield, intersecting Route 142. The road then continues north to its northern terminus at U.S. Route 160 (US 160) in Caulfield. The route was designated in 1941, after a supplementary route was renumbered. Route description The route is located in Ozark and Howell counties. In 2015, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 1,566 vehicles traveling on Route 101 south of US 160, and as few as 1258 vehicles traveling north of the Arkansas‚ÄìMissouri state line. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Route 101 starts at the Missouri‚ÄìArkansas state line, at the northern terminus of Arkansas Route 101 and County Road 583 (CRD 583). The road travels through a forest and parallel to the state line for the first . At CRD 588, the route turns northeastward, intersecting a few driveways until it reaches CRD 586, where it turns northward past the intersection. Route 101 travels eastward before it intersects CRD 584, and enters the corporate limits of Bakersfield at CRD 585. The route briefly travels north and intersects Route O, which leads to the unincorporated area of Udall. The road enters the center of the city at Main Street and curves northward at the western terminus of Route 142. Route 101 leaves the city north of Starks. The road enters through a mix of farmland and forests as it continued through southeast Ozark County. At CRD 101-174, the route begins to turn northeastward and later intersects CRD 597. Route 101 crosses the county line at CRD 7890, and enters Howell County. Once inside the county, the route turns north at Route YY and intersects CRD 7690. The road turns to the northeast in the community of Caulfield, and ends at US 61 in a T-intersection. History The designation was first used for another route in Wayne County in 1937, for a gravel road that connected from Route 34 to Sam A. Baker State Park. The route was renumbered to Route 143 by 1941. For the current designation, Route M was designated to a gravel road in 1932 that started from the state line to Route 80, passing through Bakersfield. It was renumbered to Route 101 in 1941, part of many changes made by the Missouri State Highway Commission. All of the route was paved by 1953. Around 1954, Route 101 was realigned west of Bakersfield, shifting the southern terminus to the west. US 160 replaced the Route 80 designation in the same year.

Her name means to move forward in Setswana, a Southern African language. Early life Goapele's South African father Douglas Mohlabane was an exiled political activist who struggled against the Apartheid System. Goapele's New York-born Israeli Jewish mother Noa had been attending protests since the age of 12. Noa attended Friends World College and was studying in Nairobi, Kenya, where she met and married Douglas. Goapele and her older brother DJ Namane Mohlabane were raised in a California South African exile community. Both of her parents inspired Goapele to become very involved in community affairs at a young age. She attended the Berkeley Arts Magnet School, where she led a pre-teen peer-support group. She also became involved in various groups and organizations that combated racism and sexism. In high school, she sang in the Oakland Youth Choir and became part of a music group called Vocal Motion. Upon high school graduation, she attended Boston's Berklee College of Music, where she studied music theory. Today, her music often highlights the need for political and socio-economic change. She says she has been influenced by many including Stevie Wonder, Etta James, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Bob Marley, Portishead, Miriam Makeba, Prince, Sade, Caiphus Semenya, Zulu Spears, and Hugh Masekela.

In 2001, she self-released her debut album, Closer, which sold 5,000 copies. At the same time, she was building a devoted audience through her popular live performances in the San Francisco Bay Area. \\"Closer\\" peaked at No. 63 on Billboard's Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 2002 she reworked Closer, adding five new songs. With the help of her family, she formed her own independent label, Skyblaze Recordings, to oversee her musical career. She released her first nationally distributed album, Even Closer, featuring the single \\"Closer,\\" through Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings. \\"Closer\\" was also featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie Honey. In 2004, Columbia/SME Records picked up Skyblaze Recordings for worldwide distribution and rereleased the album with additional tracks. She co-wrote and co-produced the entire album, which is a mixture of neo-soul, trip hop, lieder, and jazz. She also toured North America with the band Spearhead. In 2004, Even Closer peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Charts for Top Independent Albums. =Change It All= Her second album, Change It All, featuring the single \\"First Love\\" and the song \\"Love Me Right,\\" was released December 2005.

Retrieved Nov 16, 2012 In 2015, he received an \\"Outstanding Technology Contribution Award\\" from the Web Intelligence Consortium, for his research on the Global Brain. Work His research focuses on the emergence and evolution of complex, intelligent organization. Applications include the origin of life, the development of multicellular organisms, knowledge, culture, and societies, and the impact of information and communication technologies on present and future social evolution. Heylighen's scientific work covers an extremely wide range of subjects, exemplifying his intellectual curiosity and fundamentally transdisciplinary way of thinking. In addition to the topics mentioned above, his publications cover topics such as the foundations of quantum mechanics, the structure of space-time, hypermedia interfaces, the psychology of self- actualization and happiness, the market mechanism, formality and contextuality in language, causality, the measurement of social progress, the mechanism of stigmergy and its application to the web. =Basic ideas= This broad variety of work is held together by two basic principles. The relational principle notes that phenomena do not exist on their own, but only in relation (connection or distinction) to other phenomena. They thus only make sense as part of an encompassing network or system.Heylighen, F. (2001). Bootstrapping knowledge representations: from entailment meshes via semantic nets to learning webs. Kybernetes, 30(5/6), 691‚Äì725. The evolutionary principle notes that variation through (re)combination of parts and natural selection of the fitter combinations results in ever more complex and adaptive systems. This principle is a direct application of Universal Darwinism, the idea that Darwinian mechanisms can be extended to virtually all disciplines and problem domains. The two principles come together in Heylighen's concept of a distinction dynamics.Heylighen, F. (1990). Representation and Change: A Metarepresentational Framework for the Foundations of Physical and Cognitive Science. Communication and Cognition. In his analysis, classical scientific methodology is based on given, unchanging distinctions between elements or states. Therefore, it is intrinsically unable to model creative change. But the evolutionary principle makes distinctions dynamic, explaining the creation and destruction of relations, distinctions and connections, and thus helping us to understand how and why complex organization emerges. Moreover, any system must be adapted to its environment, which implies that it is able to react adequately to changes in that environment. This is the origin of mind or intelligence, as the system should be able to select the right actions for the given conditions. These \\"condition-action\\" relations are the basis of knowledge.Heylighen, F. (2011). Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration. Integral Review. As systems evolve, their adaptiveness tends to increase, and therefore also their knowledge or intelligence. Thus, the general trend of evolution is self-organization, or a spontaneous increase in intelligent organization. =Principia Cybernetica= Together with Cliff Joslyn and the late Valentin Turchin, Heylighen is a founding editor of the Principia Cybernetica Project, which is devoted to the collaborative development of an evolutionary-systemic philosophy. He created its website, the Principia Cybernetica Web, in 1993, as one of the first complex webs in the world. It is still viewed as one of the most important sites on cybernetics, systems theory and related approaches. =The Global Brain= In 1996, Heylighen founded the \\"Global Brain Group\\", an international discussion forum that groups most of the scientists who have worked on the concept of emergent Internet intelligence. Together with his PhD student Johan Bollen, Heylighen was the first to propose algorithms that could turn the world-wide web into a self-organizing, learning network that exhibits collective intelligence, i.e. a Global brain. In the 2007 article \\"The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society\\" Heylighen gave a detailed exposition of the superorganism/global brain view of society, and an examination of the underlying evolutionary mechanisms, with applications to the ongoing and future developments in a globalizing world. Presently, he is developing a detailed mathematical and simulation model of the global brain, together with his collaborators in the Global Brain Institute.Heylighen, F. (2012).

York. York began founding Black Muslim groups in New York in 1967. He changed his teachings and the names of his groups many times, incorporating concepts from Judaism, Christianity, and many esoteric beliefs. In the late 1980s, he abandoned the Muslim theology of his movement in favor of Kemetism and UFO religion. In 1991 he took his community to settle in upstate New York; then they moved near to Eatonton, the county seat of Putnam County in Georgia. His followers built an ancient Egypt-themed compound called Tama-Re and changed their name to the \\"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.\\" By 2000, the \\"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors\\" had some 500 adherents., citing , reports an estimated 550 adherents They drew thousands of visitors for \\"Savior's Day\\" (York's birthday). Adherence declined steeply after York was convicted of numerous counts of child molestation and financing violations, and sentenced to 135 years in federal prison in April 2004. The Tama-Re compound was sold under government forfeiture and demolished. The Southern Poverty Law Center described York as a \\"black supremacist cult leader\\", and has designated the organization as a \\"hate group\\". The group has taken numerous names, including Ansaru Allah Community, Holy Tabernacle Ministries, United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors (after the move to Georgia), Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation (also used in Georgia when York claimed indigenous ancestry via Egyptian migration and intermarriage with the ancient Olmec) and Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.  Founder  The Nuwaubian Nation was centered exclusively on the person of its founder, Malachi (Dwight) York, who legally changed his name several times, and has used dozens of aliases. York was born on June 26, 1935 (also reported as 1945). Philips shows that in 1975, York's publications changed his declared birth year from 1935 to 1945, to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Muhammad Ahmad (The Mahdi), who is popularly believed to have been born in 1845 He began his ministry in the late 1960s, from 1967 preaching to a group he called the Pan- African \\"Nubians\\" (viz. African Americans) in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. York founded numerous esoteric or quasi-religious fraternal orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s, at first along pseudo-Islamic lines, later moving to a loose Afrocentric ancient Egypt theme, eclectically mixing ideas taken from Black nationalism, cryptozoology and UFO religions and popular conspiracy theories. During the 1980s, he was also active as a musician as Dr. York, recording for Passion Records. York published some 450 booklets (dubbed \\"scrolls\\") under numerous pseudonyms. During the late 1990s, he styled himself a messianic founder-prophet of his movement, sometimes claiming divine status or extraterrestrial origin, appearing on his Savior's Day celebrations at Tama-Re. York was arrested in May 2002, and in 2003 he pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse after being indicted on 197 counts of child molestation, including charges of sex trafficking of minors across state lines. These minors were as young as 8 years old. He was imprisoned. In 2004, he was convicted to a 135-year sentence for transporting minors across state lines in the course of sexually molesting them, racketeering, and financial reporting charges. His convictions were upheld on appeal. York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents. The case was described in the book Ungodly: A True Story of Unprecedented Evil (2007) by Bill Osinski, a reporter who had covered the Nuwaubians in Georgia during the late 1990s. Some factions of the Black supremacist subculture in the United States appeared to continue to support York as of 2010, portraying his conviction as a conspiracy by the \\"White Power Structure\\". Malik Zulu Shabazz, chairman of the New Black Panther Party and York's lawyer, described York as \\"a great leader of our people [‚Ä¶ and] victim of an open conspiracy by our enemy.\\"  History  During the 1970s, the group set up bookstores and chapters in Trinidad; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington, D.C. According to former follower Saadik Redd, York had between 2,000 and 3,000 followers during the 1970s. Its headquarters was in Bushwick, Brooklyn, until 1983. A portion of the community moved to Sullivan County, New York, to a site they called Camp Jazzir Abba. More people stayed in Brooklyn until about 1991. A Muslim cleric, Bilal Philips, published The Ansar Cult in America in 1988, denouncing the movement as un-Islamic. Phillips relied heavily on testimonies of former adherents in describing the group's beliefs and practices. In the late 1980s, York borrowed from numerous religious and esoteric traditions beyond Islam, creating the \\"Nuwaubian\\" movement. York styled his movement in a mixture of Ancient Egypt and Native American themes. He legally changed his name again, from \\"Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi\\" to \\"Malachi York,\\" effective March 12, 1993.According to a scan of a court document presented at nuwaubianfacts.com Former follower Robert J. Rohan had a critical view of York's changes, as noted in this interview: After moving to Georgia, York and his followers claimed affiliation with Masons and with the Jewish, Christian and Egyptian faiths. \\"Once he started changing religious ideas, the older followers became skeptical and left the group,\\" Rohan said. \\"That was what happened to me.\\" Among its themes, the Nuwaubians borrowed a claim to indigenous ancestry, perhaps from the Washitaw Nation (a Louisiana Black separatist group led by an eccentric 'empress'). They claimed to be indigenous people, named Yamasee (claiming affiliation with the confederation of Muscogee (Creek) Native American nations in the Georgia area) as well as \\"Moors.\\" They claimed a prehistoric migration to America \\"before the continents drifted apart\\". At this point, the group called itself \\"Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation\\". During the early 2000s, York presided at Tama-Re styled as \\"Our Own Pharoah NETER A'aferti Atum-Re\\", leader and chief mystagogue of \\"The Ancient Egiptian Order.\\"  Reception = Political influence in Georgia = Initially the Nuwaubians were considered eccentric but tolerable. But tensions increased locally when they distributed leaflets attacking whites and claiming racial persecution in a zoning conflict. They had set up a nightclub in a warehouse on their property. They alienated many residents of the area, both black and white. In 1998, the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney. Within Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to national activists, claiming to be racially persecuted in the county. In 1999, Al Sharpton visited Tama-Re to express his support for the Nuwaubians. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores \\"in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad,\\" and continued to gain revenues from them. York purchased a $557,000 mansion for his own use in Athens, Georgia, about 60 miles away, where the University of Georgia is located. In 2001, the group put up their own candidates, associated with the Republican Party, for public office, including sheriff. Their candidates were defeated. In conjunction with a Nuwaubian Nation parade held in Augusta, Georgia, in February 2001, the office of Augusta mayor Bob Young (1999‚Äì2005) published a proclamation written by the Nuwaubian organization, stating the group's beliefs. Quotes include \\"the Nuwbuns were the dark, brown-to-black-skin, wooly-hair original Eygyptians.\\" \\"[T]he Black race's greatness has been accepted in America and many books as people of Timbuktu Africa or the Olmecians from Uganda, Africa, who migrated and walked here to North and South America to set up colonies way before the continental drift.\\" In an interview with a reporter from The Augusta Chronicle, Mayor Young said that he had not personally read the statement prior to its release. He explained that his office customarily releases proclamations drafted and submitted for publication by civic groups without subjecting them to substantial content review. He suggested that such proclamations do not constitute official positions of the mayor's office or statements of the mayor's views. On May 8, 2002, Tama-Re was raided by a joint force of FBI and ATF agents, state police, and local law enforcement. Although there were fears that the raid would end in violence, no shots were fired during the operation, although tear gas was used by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team. York, along with his wife, was arrested outside of the property the same day on federal charges of child molestation and racketeering, including transport of minors for sexual use. He was convicted in 2004 by a jury in federal court and sentenced to 135 years in federal prison. His appeal failed, and the US Supreme Court declined to hear the last appeal. Tama-Re was sold in asset forfeiture under the verdict, and the new owners demolished the structures. With the revelations of York's conduct, most followers abandoned the group, although some factions of the Nuwaubian Nation still exist. York is currently incarcerated in ADX Florence, a maximum-security federal prison in Florence, Colorado. He will be eligible for parole in 2122. In 2004, seven officers of the Macon, Georgia, police department resigned from their jobs in protest against the prosecution of York. Five of those officers were later hired by the Clarke County, Georgia, jail as guards. Four of them were fired in 2006 (the fifth resigned) in the wake of charges that they were smuggling Nuwaubianist literature into the jail, corresponding with the prisoner York, encouraging inmates to rebel against white guards, and showing favoritism to Nuwaubian prisoners. The jail commander was fired after he began an investigation of Nuwaubianist influence at the jail. He has said he believes that he was fired because he undertook this investigation. = Influence upon hip-hop = As \\"Dr. York,\\" the movement leader was active as a vocalist and music producer in Brooklyn before leaving the area. During this time, his Nuwaubian teachings had an effect upon hip hop and Black culture in New York. Journalist Adam Heimlich of the New York Press suggested the following were influenced by York: Jaz-O, Doug E. Fresh, Afrika Bambaataa, Posdnuos from De La Soul, Prodigy from Mobb Deep, and MF Doom. In his article on York's cult, Heimlich reviewed some of the leader's published works. He wrote that York had borrowed from a variety of sources for his ideas: Among the indie hip hop ranks, there are Nuwaubians who perform what they call Nu-wop, such as Daddi Kuwsh, Twinity, Nefu Amun Hotep, 9thScientist, Scienz of Life, Ntelek, Jedi Mind Tricks, Aslaam Mahdi, 720 Pure Sufi, Tos El Bashir and The Lost Children of Babylon. On Where Light's \\"Swords of Malachai\\", Rasul lets loose: 'When my tongue swings in the form of a double- edged sword, it brings forth Nuwaubu, which is right Knowledge, wisdom and understanding.'\\" In an article for Honor Nation, A. L. JakeAl Reum speculated that the controversial Native American kitsch costumes and props from OutKast's 46th Annual Grammy Awards performance in 2004 were inspired by the Nuwaubian belief about the Native Americans being \\"Moors\\" in origin.  Beliefs  Southern Poverty Law Center described the Nuwaubianism belief system as \\"mix[ing] black supremacist ideas with worship of the Egyptians and their pyramids, a belief in UFOs and various conspiracies related to the Illuminati and the Bilderbergers\\" and quoted York's letter dated Nov. 10, 2004 as: \\"The Caucasian has not been chosen to lead the world. They lack true emotions in their creation. We never intended them to be peaceful. They were bred to be killers, with low reproduction levels and a short life span.\\" Another explanation has Caucasians descend from Cain: \\"Adam and Eve were sent to the Aegean Islands between Asia and Europe, where they started having children, and each couple's first born child was an Albino and those Albinos are called Cain in the Bible, and Cain is short for Caucasian.\\" In 1994 Ghazi Y. Khankan, director of the New York office of the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations, commented about York and his group based on their history in Brooklyn. He said, \\"It's a cult, in my opinion, and in Islam there are no cults. They consider their leader a prophet, which means they have deviated from the Islamic way.\\" The superficial similarity of York's beliefs to those of the Heaven's Gate cult led to some worried newspaper articles after that group's mass suicide during the appearance of Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp in 1997, in which the cult was reported to have said that a spacecraft was following the comet. Pseudo-language  One simple form of Nuwaubic is a simple substitution cipher. York taught a number of \\"revealing\\" pseudo-etymologies of English words, for instance: ; believe: be-lie-eve: to lie to Eve's children. ; Caucasian: from \\"Carcass-Asian\\" meaning \\"Degenerated Asian\\" ; dyslexia: from the Greek \\"dys\\" (hard, difficult or against) and the Latin \\"lexia\\" (law), meaning \\"to go against the law\\" ; god: from the Hebrew letters Gomar, Oz, and Dubar, which signify \\"wisdom ‚Äì strength ‚Äì beauty\\"; alternately, this word comes from reversing the letters of \\"dog\\" (NB: Hebrew does not have the equivalent of the letter O, and the names for the equivalent letters of G and D are Gimel and Dalet, respectively.) ; Jesus: a combination of the words \\"Jah\\" and \\"Zeus\\" ; U.S.A.: from the Egyptian word \\"usa\\" meaning \\"eye\\"  See also  * Black Egyptian hypothesis * Five-Percent Nation * Tama-Re * Universal Zulu Nation * Nation of Islam * Black supremacy  References  Further reading  * * reprint: Islamic Book Service (2003), .

The left and right common iliac veins come together in the abdomen at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, forming the inferior vena cava. They drain blood from the pelvis and lower limbs. Both common iliac veins are accompanied along their course by common iliac arteries. Structure The external iliac vein and internal iliac vein unite in front of the sacroiliac joint to form the common iliac veins. Both common iliac veins ascend to form the inferior vena cava behind the right common iliac artery at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The vena cava is to the right of the midline and therefore the left common iliac vein is longer than the right. The left common iliac vein occasionally travels upwards to the left of the aorta to the level of the kidney, where it receives the left renal vein and crosses in front of the aorta to join the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac vein is virtually vertical and lies behind and then lateral to its artery. Each common iliac vein receives iliolumbar veins, while the left also receives the median sacral vein which lies on the right of the corresponding artery. Clinical significance Overlying arterial structures may cause compression of the upper part of the left common iliac vein. Compression of the left common iliac vein against the fifth lumbar vertebral body by the right common iliac artery as the artery crosses in front of it traditionally happens in May‚ÄìThurner syndrome. Continuous pulsation of the common iliac artery may trigger an inflammatory response within the common iliac vein. The resulting intraluminal elastin and collagen deposition can cause intimal fibrosis and the formation of venous spurs and webs. This can lead to narrowing of the vein and cause persistent unilateral leg swelling, contributing to venous thromboembolism.

Amyclae or Amyklai () was a city of ancient Laconia, situated on the right or western bank of the Eurotas, 20 stadia south of Sparta, in a district remarkable for the abundance of its trees and its fertility. Amyclae was one of the most celebrated cities of Peloponnesus in the heroic age. It is said to have been founded by the Lacedaemonian king Amyclas, the father of Hyacinthus, and to have been the abode of Tyndarus, and of Castor and Pollux, who are hence called Amyclaei Fratres.; Stat. Theb. 7.413. Amyclae is mentioned by Homer, and it continued to maintain its independence as an Achaean town long after the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians. According to the common tradition, which represented the conquest of Peloponnesus as effected in one generation by the descendants of Heracles, Amyclae was given by the Dorians to Philonomus, as a reward for his having betrayed to them his native city Sparta. Philonomus is further said to have peopled the town with colonists from Imbros and Lemnos; but there can be no doubt that the ancient Achaean population maintained themselves in the place independent of Sparta for many generations. It was only shortly before the First Messenian War that the town was conquered by the Spartan king Teleclus.; Conon 36; The tale ran, that the inhabitants of Amyclae had been so often alarmed by false reports of the approach of the enemy, that they passed a law that no one should mention the subject; and accordingly, when the Spartans at last came, and no one dared to announce their approach, \\"Amyclae perished through silence:\\" hence arose the proverb Amyclis ipsis taciturnior (\\"quieter than Amyclae itself\\").Serv. ad Virg. Aen. 10.564. After its capture by the Lacedaemonians Amyclae became a village, and was only memorable by the festival of the Hyacinthia celebrated at the place annually, and by the temple and colossal statue of Apollo, who was hence called Amyclaeus. The throne on which this statue was placed was a celebrated work of art, and was constructed by Bathycles of Magnesia. It was crowned by a great number of bas-reliefs, of which an account is given by Pausanias. et seq.

The counterclockwise terminus of I-270 is at the junction with I-55 and I-255 in Mehlville, Missouri; the clockwise terminus of the freeway is at the junction with I-55 and I-70 north of Troy, Illinois. The entire stretch of I-270 is . I-270 between I-70 and I-55 was formerly designated I-244, a western bypass of St. Louis, Missouri. It was originally proposed by Missouri as I-144, but the road was a beltway (or part of one), so the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) assigned it the number I-244. By the late 1970s, the entire beltway (including today's I-255) was integrated as a part of I-270 for consistency. However, the politicians in Illinois started planning their supplemental freeway system in the mid-1970s and a section of Corridor 413 was included into the Interstate Highway System in April 1978. This caused a potential place of confusion in Pontoon Beach, Illinois, where I-270 would have intersected itself, and eventually the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) decided on the I-255 numbering in 1980 (but not before considering renumbering an section to I-870). Route description In Missouri, I-270 diverges from at I-55 as a 10-lane freeway heading west of I-55's route but still maintaining a I-55's tendency to travel northward. I-270 intersects I-44 in a modified cloverleaf interchange that was rebuilt in the 1990s. Railroad overpasses and rocky bluffs between I-44 and Dougherty Ferry Road reduced the interstate to eight lanes for about 2 miles; however, this section was widened as of late 2013 to 5 lanes in each direction. I-270 meets up with I-64 with a stack interchange that was built from 1987 to 1993 (it was previously a cloverleaf that was a frequent source of backups). From Dougherty Ferry Road through I-70, it continues as a 10-lane Interstate, although the right lanes often serve as exit lanes. The intersection with Olive was upgraded to a single-point urban interchange in the mid-2000s, and during 2010‚Äì11, the interchanges with Route 364 (Page Avenue) and Dorsett Road were upgraded with the latter becoming a diverging diamond interchange in October 2010. Congestion in this area is severe to the point MoDOT has spent millions on various traffic control improvements since the 1990s. One of the safety improvements is a \\"double white line\\" that motorists are not permitted to cross (violation of that could lead to a fine of $500) that is located at the exits for I-70 in the northbound lanes. Other safety implementations include a special Maryland Heights police cruiser that is dedicated to traffic enforcement on this section of I-270, congestion warning signs, and traffic cameras. At I-70, I-270 makes a transition from a north‚Äìsouth highway to an east‚Äìwest highway though not signed as such until McDonnell Road, and will eventually become a six-lane highway by the time it reaches Lindbergh Road. It then meets I-170, which had its interchange rebuilt from 2001‚Äì04 during which a left exit lane in the westbound lane was corrected. This section of I-270 was a source of frequent backups during the late-afternoon hours until the interchange was rebuilt. A fatal accident in September 1999 spurred the rebuilding of the interchange although the accident did not occur at that location happening a mile east of the interchange. I-270 then passes various streets where every westbound exit connects to Dunn Road and one must use Dunn Road to access I-270 with the only exceptions being the Riverview, Lilac, and Route 367) exits. Since Dunn Road handles two-way traffic, this has become a safety and congestion issue that MoDOT wants to address in the near future. At Lilac, I-270 constricts to four lanes as it crosses the Mississippi River on the New Chain of Rocks Bridges. Approaching Missouri and entering Illinois, I-270 transitions from a suburban Interstate to an exurban Interstate with farm fields and wooded land bordering the Interstate in the area to the immediately east and west of the river crossing. Once it crosses the Chain of Rocks Canal, I-270 will intersect four different highways providing access to communities in eastern Madison County: IL 3, Old Alton Road, IL 203 and IL 111\\\\. The interchange with IL 3 is a partial cloverleaf with the loop ramps in the northeast and southeast quadrants. The remaining two are cloverleaf interchanges, with the Old Alton Road/IL 203 interchange using a collector‚Äìdistributor system with two folded diamonds due to the presence of railroad tracks between the two roadways. Once it passes IL 111, the speed limit increases to as the highway briefly becomes six lanes again with the junction with I-255. The highway then reverts to a four-lane highway offering diamond interchanges with IL 157 and IL 159 before meeting up with I-55/I-70 at the interchange that IDOT refers as the \\"3 I's\\". The eastbound I-270 meets the northeastbound combination of I-55 and I-70 which leave the intersection as northbound I-55 and eastbound I-70 which has adopted I-270's mile markings. History The section of I-270 on the Missouri side was completed by June 1964, while the section that was I-244 was completed by November 1968. The section from Illinois Route 3 (IL 3) to I-55 in Illinois was finished by May 1965. During the Great Flood of 1993, the New Chain of Rocks Bridge carrying I-270 over the Mississippi River was the only bridge open from St. Louis to Keokuk, Iowa, at one point. (All other bridges from the McKinley Bridge to the Keokuk Bridge were closed at the peak of that flood.) The last major construction project on I-270 occurred from 1995 to 1998. Both the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and IDOT upgraded I-270 to modern standards from Lilac Avenue to I-255. However, this section of I-270 is still at two lanes in each direction. On September 13, 1999, a fatal accident involving a tractor-trailer occurred in the westbound lanes of I-270 in front of the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas-Mercy High School (now North County Christian School) in North St. Louis County. This accident sped up efforts that led to the I-170/I-270 interchange reconstruction that went from 2001 to 2004. A major accident and fire from a FedEx Ground truck between the Route 367 and Lilac Avenue exits on October 28, 2002, forced detours and lengthy delays. There were plans to sign an section of I-270 from Glen Carbon to Edwardsville as I-870. However, this idea was discarded. In 2008, MoDOT implemented new variable speed limits on I-270/I-255 with the normal limit being . However, due to complaints from the public, these signs were planned to be updated in 2011 to advisory signs. A section of I-270 between I-44 and Manchester was widened to five lanes in each direction, with work taking place between 2012 and 2013. This section of I-270 sees up to 185,000 vehicles per day,] and peak hour congestion is common. Future IDOT wanted to widen I-270 from Lilac Avenue to I-255 from four lanes to six, but no money is available at the time of the proposal in 2007. However, IDOT has announced that nearly $100 million has been programmed for replacement of the canal bridges between 2011 and 2016. The canal bridges were replaced in Summer 2014, and imploded Winter 2015. MoDOT has also identified the need of improving the I-270 corridor in North St. Louis County, which could cost in the range of $200 million. MoDOT recently held a public study of this corridor and has a website of this. No funding is available for construction of the possible upgrades.

Named after the university's first chancellor, Edward Weidner, the venue opened January 15, 1993.  History  The Weidner Center's original gift came from surgeon David A. Cofrin (son of Austin E. Cofrin and namesake of UW-Green Bay's library) with the stipulation that the center be located on the UW-Green Bay campus and that it serve the community. The university used state funds for the project as the original plan for UW- Green Bay's campus included a performing arts center. Namesake chancellor Weidner began a fundraising campaign in the late 1980s that raised the remainder of the $18.4 million required for the building. The university calls the Weidner Center a \\"'comm-university' center, supported by both the university and the communities of northeastern Wisconsin\\". = 1998 expansion = For the Weidner Center's fifth anniversary, donations from the Cofrin family financed an expansion that included a new black-box theatre named Studio Two, later renamed the Jean Weidner Theatre in honor of Ed Weidner's wife. The renovation also expanded the ticket office, added more lobby restrooms, expanded backstage storage and dressing room space, constructed a semi-private dining area and food service elevator, and relocated the Weidner Center's administrative offices.  Facilities = Cofrin Family Hall = Cofrin Family Hall is the Weidner Center's main performance facility, seating 2,021 over three levels of seating. The capacity of Cofrin Family Hall depends on the type of performance, as the Weidner Center's two-section motorized thrust stage can be lowered and fitted with extra seats, typically for dramatic performances. Symphonic and other music-only performances routinely use the entire thrust. Cofrin Family Hall also contains a large pipe organ, the Wood Family Organ, built for the Weidner Center's acoustics. Nearly all of the Weidner Center's touring acts perform in Cofrin Family Hall, with eclectic programming that includes concerts, comedians, Broadway shows, children's programming, and more. UW-Green Bay holds its winter graduations in Cofrin Family Hall. The UWGB Music department's Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, University Singers, and Concert Choir all perform two concerts per semester in Cofrin Family Hall, and the department's annual JazzFest takes place in Cofrin Family Hall in the spring. The UWGB Theatre department performs in Cofrin Family Hall occasionally, putting on Cabaret in 2011. It performed another musical there in fall 2015 and participated in the Weidner Center's Stage Door educational theatre series in spring 2016 and 2017. = Fort Howard Hall = Fort Howard Hall, named for the Fort Howard Paper Company founded by donor Austin E. Cofrin, is a recital hall. It seats 200 in retractable theatre-style seating, and can seat 136 in a banquet-style setting. The room is used for receptions and pre-show dinners. The UWGB Music department is the most frequent academic user of the space, and holds its Student Honors Recital and several guest artist concerts and lectures there annually. = Studio One = Built in the style of a dance studio with mirrors and marley dance floor, Studio One is rarely used for its intended purpose, instead serving as a multipurpose space for the Weidner Center, and a reception area/backstage storage for the UWGB Theatre department when it is performing in the Jean Weidner Theatre. = Jean Weidner Theatre = Built in the 1998 renovation and originally called Studio Two, the space was renamed the Jean Weidner Theatre after Edward Weidner's wife. Jean Weidner Theatre is a black-box style theatre that seats 90 in either a standard theatre style or a theatre in the round arrangement. Although it is part of the Weidner Center, the UWGB Theatre department oversees the space and is its primary user. The UWGB Music department holds most of its student recitals in the space, along with its Opera/Musical Theatre workshop.

This was a religious movement that had a variety of esoteric beliefs and was led by Dwight D. York. Many of the African Americans in the community had resettled here from Brooklyn, New York, where the movement had been developing since about 1970. York was prosecuted for child molestation, racketeering and financial charges; convicted in 2004, he was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of the verdict, the Tama-Re complex was sold under government forfeiture in 2005. The structures were mostly demolished, and the site cleared by the sheriff's department to prepare it for sale. History On 15 January 1993, Dwight York, longtime leader of a Muslim-related religious community in Brooklyn, New York, bought the property of 476 acres on 404 Shady Dale Road for $975,000. His followers began moving in from their former headquarters in Sullivan County, New York (some had moved there in the late 1980s) and Brooklyn. After the move, York declared affiliation with the Yamasee indigenous people, as well as a variety of Egyptian and esoteric themes, claiming that the community was descended from ancient migrants to the Americas from Egypt. York said :\\"We moved to Eatonton, Georgia because we are the Yamassee, a branch of the Washitaw Moors, The Mound Builders. Our Ancestors built the Rock Eagle Mound and many others in such states as Wisconsin, Ohio, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Tennessee. This is why we chose Eatonton to live. It is close to Rock Eagle Mound.\\" In 1997 and 1998, Victor Greig acted as York's representative in building and zoning matters as the community developed Tama-Re. He was cited by Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills for building without a permit and for illegally operating a nightclub in a warehouse, which was not zoned for that use. Greig was fined $45,750 in April 1998 and appealed. His fine was reduced to $2,500, but the conviction was upheld. The organization began to hold festivals on the property, with one netting about $500,000 in cash, according to an FBI agent's testimony. In 1999, a lawsuit was filed attempting to enforce county zoning restrictions and prevent the Nuwaubians from using the property for anything other than residential and agricultural purposes. This led to a drawn-out, bitter tug of war between the Nuwaubians and the county authorities. At the annual week-long celebration \\"Savior's Day\\" (i.e. York's birthday) in June 1999, the county padlocked the nightclub warehouse. In 2000, a security/paramilitary group called the Royal Guard of Amen-Ra, Inc., owned by actor Wesley Snipes's Amen Ra Films, filed BATF papers to set up a security training center next to the Tama-Re compound. The Nuwaubians claimed Snipes as one of their own, though a spokeswoman for Snipes denied any connection. New York Press in November 2000 described the constructions completed in the compound: > Not long after you're pretty sure you've gone too far, roll up and over one > last hill and the pyramids are right there.

In March 2002, the Nuwaubians finally submitted a permit application for the nightclub, now called a \\"fellowship hall\\", allowing them to use the building for the first time since it was padlocked. On 8 May 2002, the compound was raided by the FBI, ATF, and related forces from local, state, and federal departments. No shots were fired during the raid, although tear gas was used by FBI agents. Based on a lengthy investigation, authorities arrested York on charges of racketeering and child molestation, including transporting children across state lines for the purpose of sexual exploitation. After York was convicted and sentenced for these charges, in June 2005, the property was sold under government forfeiture by the U.S. Marshals Service for US$1.1 million.Torpy, Bill. \\"Demolition begins on land seized from Nuwaubian sect,\\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Atlanta, Ga.: 11 June 2005. pg.

There are a number of conservative parties in Canada, a country that has traditionally been dominated by two political parties, one liberal and one conservative. The span between the 2015 Newfoundland and Labrador provincial election and the 2016 Manitoba provincial election was the first time since 1943 when no party with the word \\"Conservative\\" in its name formed the government in either a provincial or federal jurisdiction. The federal conservative movement=Progressive Conservatives= The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was the primary conservative party in Canada from 1942 to, at least, 1993. It was the descendant of Sir John A. Macdonald's Liberal-Conservative Party. The party had its roots in the Great Coalition of 1864 that paved the way for Canadian confederation and was known under various names but was generally referred to unofficially as the Tories or \\"Conservative Party\\". In 1942, it became \\"Progressive Conservative\\" upon the election of Liberal-Progressive Premier of Manitoba John Bracken as leader in that year. The Conservatives, and later the Progressive Conservatives, formed the government in Canada, alternating with the Liberal Party of Canada, from 1867-1873, 1878-1896, 1911‚Äì1921, 1926, 1930-1935, 1957-1963, 1979-1980 and 1984-1993. Throughout the period from the first election in 1867 to the 1993 election, the national conservative party always formed the government or the official opposition under the names \\"Liberal-Conservatives\\", \\"Unionists\\", \\"Conservatives\\" or Progressive Conservatives\\". =The demise of the Progressive Conservatives and rise of Reform= In 1993, the Progressive Conservatives went from majority government to holding only two of 295 seats in the House of Commons of Canada, this was the first time they had done worse than third place in the House, and only the second time they had placed worse than second (the other time being in the 1921 election): they in fact placed fifth and last in terms of parties represented in the commons behind the Liberals, the Reform Party of Canada, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and the New Democratic Party. The Reform Party was a populist conservative party based in Western Canada which cut into traditional PC support while the Bloc was a Quebec separatist party which cut into the support of the PCs in Quebec where they traditionally won support for their decentralization stance. Reform and the PCs finished with similar popular vote totals in the 1993 and subsequent elections but, under the first past the post electoral system the Reformers won many more seats due to their strong regional support in the West versus the thin national support for the PCs across Canada. In the 1997 election, the PCs and Reform continued to run approximately at par in popular vote and both increased their share of seats: Reform from 52 to 60 and Progressive Conservatives from two to 20. Despite this, neither rivalled the Liberals for power and the Reformers tried to \\"unite the right\\" with their United Alternative initiative. This talks were non-starters for many Progressive Conservatives who saw themselves as the national party of Sir John A. Macdonald, however the United Alternative did attract some provincial Blue Tories and renamed itself the \\"Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance\\", known publicly as the Canadian Alliance. In the 2000 election, the PCs were reduced to 12 seats, while the new Canadian Alliance gained seats. Following the election and despite Alliance leadership troubles, the PCs were unable to make significant gains in opinion polls and former Prime Minister Joe Clark resigned as leader. Following Clark's resignation as leader, Peter Mackay was elected at the 2003 PC leadership convention. Mackay began a process of talks which led to the merger of the PCs with the Alliance and the creation of a new Conservative Party of Canada. This alienated many Red Tories, including Clark, who refused to join the new party. = Today's Conservative Party of Canada = The successful merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance was followed by moderate success in the 2004 election in which the new party won 99 of 308 seats, an increase from its total of 72 of 301 seats prior to the election and 78 seats won between the two parties in 2000. Detractors pointed to the fact, however, that the new party received 7% less in popular vote than the total of the two forerunner parties in 2000. The Liberals, however, were reduced to a minority government. Outgoing Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper had been chosen as leader of the new party just prior to the 2004 election which provided a dual handicap for the party. It did not allow the party much time to combine and consolidate the bases of the two founding parties and it allowed the Liberals to define the party as the \\"Alliance Conservatives\\", insuating that it was the result of a hostile takeover by the Alliance which was viewed by many in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada as \\"too far to the right\\". These claims were bolstered by former PC Prime Minister Clark's lukewarm endorsement of the Liberals, having said Canadians would be best to choose \\"the devil you know (Liberal leader Paul Martin) than the devil you don't (Harper)\\". Martin had come into office on December 12, 2003, following a long battle with his predecessor, Jean Chr√©tien for control of the Liberal Party. Martin had been a very successful and popular finance minister under much of Chr√©tien's term and was expected to dominate politics and win a commanding majority, perhaps of record size, once he was at the helm. The merger of the conservative movement was not viewed as a large impediment to this goal when it occurred almost simultaneously with Martin's rise to power. However, the sponsorship scandal, which saw some Liberal supporters fraudulantely acquire government funds, and particularly Martin's response to it caused him to slip in the polls. During the 2004 campaign, Harper actually led in the polls for some time, but Martin launched a successful series of attack ads painting Harper to the right. This campaign was actually given a boost by Harper, who began to muse about winning a majority government, when polls showed most Canadians were uncomfortable with such a prospect, and by some Conservative candidates who made statements on controversial social issues. Harper briefly mused about giving up the leadership following the election defeat but carried forward with considerable optimism despite trailing the Liberals significantly in the polls. The Gomery Commission, which was appointed by Martin to investigate the sponsorship scandal, gave new fuel to the Conservatives. In the spring of 2005, it projected the Conservatives back into the lead in the polls and Martin held a rare live address on television to ask Canadians to give him 10 more months to govern, in which time the Gomery Commission would finish its work and release a report on its investigation, and then he would call an election. The Conservatives moved forward to defeat the government but their efforts to defeat a motion of confidence in the government were prevented by the high- profile crossing of the floor by Belinda Stronach. Stronach had finished second to Harper in the leadership race just a year before but joined the Liberals saying Harper was risking national unity by trying to defeat the government with the aid of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. During the summer, the Conservatives slipped back in the polls again and there were renewed questions of Harper's leadership and the potential success of the new party. One poll showed that 60% of Canadians thought Harper should resign. In the fall session of Parliament, despite trailing in opinion polls, Harper tried again to defeat the government. This time he was joined by all opposition parties and his motion of no confidence was passed on November 28, 2005. Harper set out on a campaign focussed heavily on policy which allowed him to dominate the headlines for the first weeks of the campaign. The Liberals opted to campaign low key until after the Christmas holiday season. By January, the Liberals began their campaign in earnest, but by this time Harper had begun to capture the minds of Canadians and the Liberals were struck by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into an income trusts scandal. The Conservatives began to take a lead in the polls, and following a strong showing in the debates among the main party leaders by Harper, the Conservatives surged into a convincing lead. The Liberals again launched a series of attack ads against Harper, however polls showed that Canadians had grown comfortable with Harper over the course of the first few weeks in which he ran a positive campaign virtually unopposed by the Liberals. In the 2006 election held on January 23, the Conservatives won a bare plurality of seats, besting the Liberals 124 to 103. They formed a minority government with just 40.3% of the seats in the House of Commons. In 2018, sitting Conservative MP Maxime Bernier (Beauce) quit the Conservative Party to form his own right-leaning party: the People's Party of Canada. =Unrepresented federal conservative parties= * The Christian Heritage Party is a religious, social conservative party * The Progressive Canadian Party bills itself as the successor to the old Progressive Conservative Party and advocated fiscal conservatism mixed with social liberalism * The Libertarian Party of Canada, like many Libertarian parties, is portrayed by many in the media as a conservative party. Provincial parties A number of Canadian provinces still have \\"Progressive Conservative\\" parties, or parties that once used that name and remained so independently of the federal change. Each party remains the largest conservative one in its respective province. =Progressive Conservatives= *The Manitoba forms the government in Manitoba *The New Brunswick forms the government in New Brunswick *Newfoundland and Labrador *Nova Scotia *The Ontario forms the government in Ontario *The Prince Edward Island forms the government on the Prince Edward Island The Yukon Party, and British Columbia Conservative Party both once used the name \\"Progressive Conservative\\", but changed their names in the past 15 years. The British Columbia (Progressive) Conservative Party's fortunes declined in 1952, with the rise of the British Columbia Social Credit Party under former BC Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly W.A.C. Bennett. The last BC Conservative MLA elected was Victor Albert Stephens‚Äîin a 1978 by-election. The United Conservative Party which forms the government in Alberta, was a merger of the \\"Progressive Conservative Association\\" and the Wildrose Party. =Quebec provincial conservatives= In Quebec, the Union Nationale was an important conservative party that formed the government for twenty-five of the thirty-four years between 1936 when it first formed government to 1970 when the last UN government was defeated. It was founded by a merger of the Quebec Conservative with a small faction that had split from the Quebec Liberal Party. There have been two attempts to revive the Conservative banner in Quebec, the Progressive Conservative Party of Quebec in the 1980s and the modern Quebec Conservative Party founded in 2009. The Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec was a conservative split from the Quebec Liberal Party and existed from 1994 until 2012 when it merged with the Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec (CAQ). At its peak in the 2007 Quebec election, the ADQ won over 30% of the vote and formed the official opposition. √âquipe Autonomiste was formed by former ADQ supporters after its merger with the CAQ. =Other provincial conservative parties= The following conservative parties have seats in provincial legislatures: *The Saskatchewan Party is a governing Liberal-Conservative coalition party in Saskatchewan. *The British Columbia Liberal Party is a Liberal-Conservative coalition party in British Columbia. *The People's Alliance in New Brunswick.  Other conservative movements  The Canadian social credit movement consisted of a number of social conservative parties and organizations in Western Canada and Quebec. The most significant of these parties were the Social Credit Party of Alberta (an antecedent of the Reform Party of Canada) and the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled their respective provinces for decades. The Social Credit Party of Canada and the Quebec-based Ralliement cr√©ditiste were important third parties in the House of Commons of Canada for several decades.

Harkness was born in Titusville, Pennsylvania. In 1934, her husband Bill Harkness had travelled to China in search of a panda, but died of throat cancer in Shanghai early in 1936. His widow Ruth, then living in New York City, decided to complete the mission herself. Harkness traveled to Shanghai, and with the help of a Chinese-American explorer named Quentin Young, and Gerald Russell, a British naturalist, launched her own panda mission. After passing through Chongqing and Chengdu, the team arrived at a mountainous region, where, on 9 November 1936, they encountered and captured a nine-week- old panda cub. The panda, which they named Su Lin after Young's sister-in-law, was bottle-fed baby formula on the journey back to Shanghai and the United States. Su lin meant the phrase \`a little bit of something very cute\`. Quentin migrated to the US in later years and felt he never go credit for his work in finding the Panda. The panda caused a great sensation in the American press and eventually ended up at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago The bear is now stuffed and on display at the Chicago Field Museum. .

Ilango Adigal was a Jain monk, a Chera prince, and a poet. He is traditionally credited as the author of Silappatikaram, one of the Five Great Epics of Tamil literature. In a patikam (prologue) to the epic poem, he identifies himself as the brother of a famous Chera king Ce·πÖku·π≠·π≠uvan (Senguttuvan). This Chera king, states Elizabeth Rosen, ruled over his kingdom in late 2nd or early 3rd century CE. However, this is doubful because a Sangam poem in Pati·πü·πüuppattu ‚Äì the fifth ten ‚Äì provides a biography of Ce·πÖku·π≠·π≠uvan, his family and rule, but never mentions that he had a brother who became an ascetic or wrote one of the most cherished epics. This has led scholars to conclude that the legendary author Ilango Adikal myth was likely inserted later into the epic. In a 1968 note, Kamil Zvelebil suggested that, \\"this [Adigal claim] may be a bit of poetic fantasy, practised perhaps by a later member of the Chera Dynasty [5th or 6th century] recalling earlier events [2nd or 3rd century]\\". Biography I·∏∑a·πÖk√µ A·π≠ika·∏∑ (lit. \\"the venerable ascetic prince\\"), also spelled Ilango Adigal or Ivangovadigal, is traditionally believed to be the author of Silappatikaram. No direct verifiable information is available about him. He is believed to have been a prince who became a Jain ascetic based on a patikam (prologue) composed and interpolated into the epic many centuries later. Ilango is considered the younger son of Chera king Nedum Cheralatan and Sonai/Nalchonai of the Chola dynasty. His elder brother is believed to be Senguttuvan, the reputed warrior-king. However, these traditional beliefs are doubtful because the Sangam era text Pati·πü·πüuppattu provides a biography of king Nedum Cheralatan and of king Senguttuvan, and in neither is Ilango Adigal ever mentioned. The author was a Jaina scholar, as in several parts of the epic, the key characters of the epic meet a Jaina monk or nun. The last canto of the epic, lines 155-178, mentions \\"I also went in\\", whose \\"I\\" scholars have assumed to be the author Adigal. The epic also mentions, among other details, the \\"Gajabahu synchronism\\". These verses state Adikal attended the Animal sacrifice by king Senguttuvan in the presence of Gajabahu, someone believed to have been the king of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) between 171 and 193 CE. This has led to the proposals that Adikal lived in the same period. These lines also mention that he became a sannyasi in a monastery outside Vanci ‚Äì the capital of the 2nd-century Chera kingdom (now parts of Kerala). This declaration has been interpreted as renouncing and becoming a Jain monk. According to Kamil Zvelebil, all this must have been a fraudulent statement added by Ilango Adikal to remain a part of the collective memory in the epic he wrote. Adikal was likely a Jain who lived a few centuries later, states Zvelebil, and his epic \\"cannot have been composed before the 5th- or 6th-century\\". Gananath Obeyesekere ‚Äì a scholar of Buddhism, Sri Lankan religious history and anthropology, considers the epic's claims of Gajabahu and the kinship between Ilango Adigal and Senguttuvan to be ahistorical, and that these lines are likely \\"a late interpolation\\" into the Tamil epic. The author was likely not a prince, nor had anything to do with the Chera dynasty, says R Parthasarathy, and these lines may have been added to the epic to give the text a high pedigree status, gain royal support, and to \\"institutionalize the worship of goddess Pattini and her temples\\" in the Tamil regions as is described in the epic. According to another Tamil legend, an astrologer predicted that he would become the ruler of the land. To stop this, and let his elder brother be the king, the prince became a Jain monk taking the name of Ilango Adigal.  Legacy  The Silappatikaram epic credited to Ilango Adigal inspired another Tamil poetic epic called Manimekalai. This poetic epic acts as a sequel to Silappatikaram. It revolves around the daughter of Kovalan (the protagonist of Silappatikaram) and Madhavi (who had an affair with Kovalan in Silappatikaram), named Manimekalai. Although Manimekalai's mother was Madhavi, she worshipped goddess Pattini (Kannaki, Kovalan's wife).

The town is located in the northwestern corner of Brest Region on the Lyasnaya river, about 40 km north from Brest. In 2002, the population was about 9,000 people. The Le≈õna Prawa river flows through the town. History A street in Kamyenyets. It was first mentioned in the Halych-Volhynian Chronicle in 1276, when a castle with a keep, the tower of Kamyenyets, was being constructed on this spot, to protect the northern boundary of Volhynia from the raids of invaders. This site on the stony steep bank of the Liasnaja (Lysna or Le≈õna) River had attracted Oleksa, the prominent builder and architect of Volhynia. He showed the site to Vladimir Vasilkovich, the Prince of Volhynia, who appreciated the place and ordered Oleksa to build a castle with a keep on the spot. Later a town appeared around the fortification. The tower is often called Bielaja Vie≈æa (alternative transliteration: Belaya Vezha), which means White Tower or White Fortress in Belarusian, because after its foundation it was tiled in white. The neighboring primeval forest of Belavezhskaya Pushcha received its name, which also means White Tower, through association with the tower. However, today the color of the castle is brick-red, having weathered through the ages, not white. The original name of the town comes from the Slavic word kamennyj which means stony in English, as it was founded atop a stony rise. In 1366, it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in 1376 it was burnt by Teutonic Crusaders but rapidly rebuilt. In 1503, local townsfolk received a limited self-administration right (probably the Magdeburg Rights) that was used by 1795, when it was annexed by Russia. In 1588 and 1659, the town was devastated with plague. In the 19th century and the first four decades of the 20th century, local Jewish community was the most active part of the townsfolk. Memories of the town are included in Yechezkel Kotik's memoir, published in English as Journey To a Nineteenth Century Shtetl: The Memoirs of Yekhezkel Kotik. In the years 1921-1939 it was in Poland. In 1939, it was occupied by Soviet Union and annexed to the Belorussian SSR. From 23 June 1941 until 22 July 1944, Kamyenyets was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of Bezirk Bialystok. During the Nazi occupation, most local Jews were killed. After World War II, the town developed as a minor center of the food processing industry (cheese and butter making, baking of bread, etc.). Attractions The main historical attraction is the donjon that accommodates a museum. There are also St Simeon's Orthodox church (1914); Sts Peter and Paul Roman Catholic church (1925) and Roman Catholic cemetery of the 18th - early 20th centuries. The building of a synagogue (used until 1941). Since 2009, there has been an annual historical Belaja Vezha Festival organized by local people.

Natrocarbonatite is a rare carbonatite lava which erupts from the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano in Tanzania within the East African Rift of eastern Africa.  Composition  Whereas most lavas are rich in silicate minerals, the natrocarbonatite lavas of Ol Doinyo Lengai are rich in the rare sodium and potassium carbonate minerals, nyerereite and gregoryite. Due to this unusual composition, the lava is erupted at relatively low temperatures (approximately 500-600 ¬∞C). This temperature is so low that the molten lava appears black in sunlight, rather than having the red glow common to most lavas. It is also much more fluid than silicate lavas.  Impact  The sodium and potassium carbonate minerals of the lavas erupted at Ol Doinyo Lengai are unstable at the Earth's surface and susceptible to rapid weathering, the minerals are anhydrous and when they come into contact with the moisture of the atmosphere, they begin to react extremely quickly.

Its eastern terminus is at the Mississippi River near Ste. Genevieve; its western terminus is at U.S. Route 54 in El Dorado Springs. It is currently one of the longest highways in the state. Most of the highway east of Lebanon is hilly and curvy, passing through a large part of the Missouri Ozarks. Route 32 is one of the original Missouri highways from 1922. It originally ran only from Licking to Flat River (now Park Hills). Other portions were defined as Route 66 (El Dorado Springs to Fair Play), Route 13 (Fair Play to Buffalo), and Route 68 (Farmington to Ste. Genevieve). Route 66 replaced Route 13 to Buffalo in 1925, but by 1927 it became part of US 54. Route 32 also absorbed Route 68 in 1926 or 1927. Route 64, which had been designated in 1922 between Collins and Preston (now US 54), was extended east to Lebanon in the early 1930s, and by 1935 it had swapped alignments with US 54, becoming the El Dorado Springs-Lebanon route that now mostly carries Route 32. Route 32 was extended west to Lebanon by 1946, and it was later extended west, leaving only the Louisburg-Lebanon section of Route 64, which has since been extended west. Route description Interstate 44 Business and joins Route 5/Route 64 in Lebanon. The highway begins at the beginning of state maintenance, at a point in the 300 block of 4th Street in Ste. Genevieve. City streets connect to a ferry providing passage across the Mississippi River to Illinois. Just before leaving the city, the route comes to an intersection with U.S. Route 61. Six miles further west is an interchange with Interstate 55 and eleven miles (18 km) west of the interstate is the northern junction of Route 144. At Farmington, the highway joins U.S. Route 67 for seven miles (6 km), then it exits at Leadington and turns into four lane to Saint Joe State Park U.S. Route 67 Business. At Caledonia, the highway turns south and forms a four-mile (6 km) concurrency with Route 21, then turns west and enters the Mark Twain National Forest. In the national forest, the highway forms a six-mile (10 km) concurrency with Route 49. As the highway nears the western boundary of the Mark Twain National Forest, the highway joins Route 72, the two highways will be united to the west side of Salem. Nine miles west of Salem is the northern terminus of Route 119. At Licking is the northern terminus of Route 137 and an intersection with U.S. Route 63. West of Licking, Route 32 enters another section of the Mark Twain National Forest. At Success, Route 32 turns north, joining Route 17 for four miles (6 km) then turns west again at Roby. At Lynchburg is the northern terminus of Route 95 and Route 32 turns north. Three miles northwest of Falcon, the highway leaves the Mark Twain National Forest. At Lebanon, Route 32 joins Route 5 and has an interchange with Interstate 44, which also serves as the eastern terminus of Route 64. In Lebanon, the highway turns southwest and leaves the concurrency with Route 5 and Route 64. At Buffalo, Route 32 forms a brief concurrency with Route 73, which it joins to the terminus of Route 73 at U.S. Route 65. The road then continues west, forming the main highway between the two county seats of Buffalo and Bolivar. At Bolivar, the highway intersect Route 83, and then intersects Route 13. At Fair Play, Route 32 briefly joins Route 123 and begins a northwest route to the north side of Stockton Lake where the highway passes over the dam. At Stockton, it joins Route 39 briefly and continue west eventually reaching the northern terminus of Route 97. At this intersection, the highway turns due north for five miles (8 km) before reaching U.S. Route 54 and ending in eastern El Dorado Springs.

It features the voice of Judy Garland in her only animated-film role, as well as Robert Goulet in his first feature film. The film received positive reviews, but was a box office bomb. It is also the first animated feature film to be theatrically released by Warner Bros, and the second of 2 animated films by UPA. Plot The story is set in 1895 France and takes place predominantly in Paris. However, it begins on a farm in rural Provence. The lovely cat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love (\\"Mewsette\\"), until the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a \\"clumsy country clod\\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of glamour and sophistication in Paris (\\"Take My Hand, Paree\\"), Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city (\\"Roses Red, Violets Blue\\"), where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice (Paul Frees). Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as \\"The Belle of all Paris\\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat in Pittsburgh known as \\"Mr. Henry Phtt\\" (\\"The Money Cat\\"). Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette. Training does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-√âlys√©es and the Mewlon Rouge and then take a buggy ride back home (\\"The Horse Won't Talk\\"). Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine sewers. By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice (known as \\"Virtue-Mousety\\"), who sees a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk (\\"Bubbles\\"), and sells them as mousers to a ship bound for Alaska. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem, regardless of size, can be broken up into manageable pieces, by remarking that even the mighty ocean is made up of little drops of water. Jaune Tom has a vision of Mewsette singing about how no problem is unconquerable, and the importance of never giving up (\\"Little Drops of Rain\\"). Mewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of paintings of her by such famous artists as Claude Monet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Seurat, Henri Rousseau, Amedeo Modigliani, Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir, Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso (an opportunity for the animators to indulge in some artistic parodies), so that he can send them to Mr. Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check to pay his \\"sister\\", Madame Reubens-Chatte (using disappearing ink, so that the check is worthless), and takes Mewsette to his hideout in Notre Dame. There, he reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her to enter a luggage crate, but after seeing a portrait of Mr. Phtt depicting him as fat and old, she manages to escape Meowrice and his sidekicks. In the resulting chase scene, she leads them to a bulldog, who injures Meowrice badly enough to put him out of action for six weeks. Meanwhile, his sycophants (who are nowhere near as intelligent as he is) comb the city without success, searching for Mewsette. Meanwhile, not long after they reach Alaska (a howling wilderness of snow), Jaune Tom and Robespierre strike gold thanks to the former's mouse-hunting skills. Now wealthy, the two cats hurry back to Paris. A disillusioned and homeless Mewsette wanders around the streets of Paris (\\"Paris is a Lonely Town\\") and stops atop a bridge over the river where she attempts to leap to her death, but she is captured by Meowrice and his sidekicks. She is taken to the Gare du Nord railway station, en route to a boat to America, and all hope seems lost, when Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive. They have been aided by Madame Ruebens- Chatte, who is irritated that her own \\"brother\\" double-crossed her and tears up the worthless check. In a humorously over-the-top fight scene inside the boxcar of a moving train, the three heroes defeat Meowrice and pack him into the crate intended for Mewsette, doubtless that this will be a nasty surprise for Mr. Phtt. The film concludes with Mewsette, Jaune Tom and Robespierre enjoying the high life in Paris that Mewsette was seeking when she left home (\\"Mewsette Finale\\"). Voice cast *Judy Garland as Mewsette, is a beautiful white Turkish Angora. Jaune Tom's girlfriend.

Production Gay Purr-ee was the second and final feature film, following 1001 Arabian Nights with Mr. Magoo, produced by UPA (United Productions of America), a studio which had revolutionized animation during the 1950s by incorporating design and limited animation. The script for Gay Purr-ee was written by Dorothy Webster Jones and her husband, Warner Bros. Cartoons veteran director Chuck Jones. The latter Jones also ultimately produced the project, moonlighting for UPA in violation of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros.Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 562-563. . One of the former animators from his Warner Bros. unit, Abe Levitow, directed the film. According to the production notes on the DVD edition, it was Garland who suggested that her Wizard of Oz songwriters, Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, should write and compose the songs for Gay Purr-ee. When Warner Bros. picked up the film for distribution, they discovered that Chuck Jones had worked on the film. After a long debate with management over the details of Jones' exclusivity agreement, Warner fired Jones in July 1962 and laid off his staff after they had finished their next cartoon. Later, after Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed, Jones hired his old unit for his first independent studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions. Release and Legacy The film was theatrically released on December 17, 1962 to positive reviews from film critics who praised Garland's performance, but Gay Purr-ee became a box office flop. The film currently holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gay_purree A Newsweek review detected an attempt to target \\"the fey four-year-old of recherch√© taste\\". A review by Jerry Beck in his 2005 book calls Gay Pur-ee \\"a good effort\\" and \\"unjustly underrated\\". He found that UPA's characteristic visual style was still present. Beck draws a similarity between Chuck Jones' later facial animation style and character eyes in Gay Purr-ee. Despite its \\"strong design sense\\" and voice cast, he agrees the animation quality is sometimes \\"on a television level or worse\\". Multiple analyses have noted its modernist style, called \\"remarkably designed\\" in one such review. One analysis claims the modernist aesthetic has plot implications: though both urban and pastoral landscapes are equally \\"highlighted\\", the plot praises the triumph of \\"pastoral nature over corrupt urban technology\\". =Home media= Gay Pur-ee released on VHS in 1991, 1992 and 1994 by Warner Home Video (under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label). The film released on DVD in 2003, and later also re-released on DVD in 2014 from the Warner Archive collection. It has been released in HD on streaming services. Soundtrack 1962 LP cover On November 4, 2003, Rhino Handmade, a division of the Warner Music Group, released the soundtrack on CD. This was identical to the 1962 LP version but contained 5 additional demo tracks. The demo tracks are performed by Harold Arlen and E. Y. \\"Yip\\" Harburg, the composers of the songs for the movie. They were also the primary songwriters for the music of The Wizard of Oz, the 1939 Garland feature. Garland stated that the song \\"Little Drops of Rain\\" was one of her favorite songs, along with \\"Over the Rainbow\\".

He wrote that the atrocity was committed by Poles and not by the German occupiers. Gross's book generated controversy and was the subject of vigorous debate in Poland and abroad. The political scientist Norman Finkelstein accused Gross of exploiting the Holocaust. Norman Davies described Neighbors as \\"deeply unfair to Poles\\".Davies: \\"Strach\\" to nie analiza, lecz publicystyka , Gazeta Wyborcza, 21 January 2008. A subsequent investigation conducted by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) supported some of Gross's conclusions, but not his estimate of the number of people murdered.

From 1980 until his death in 2017, he was a regular sports commentator on NPR's Morning Edition radio program. Deford wrote for Sports Illustrated magazine from 1962 until his death in 2017, and was a correspondent for the Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel television program on HBO. He wrote 18 books, nine of them novels. A member of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame, Deford was six times voted National Sportswriter of the Year by the members of that organization, and was twice voted Magazine Writer of the Year by the Washington Journalism Review. In 2012, Deford became the first magazine recipient of the Red Smith Award. In 2013, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal, was presented with the William Allen White Citation for \\"excellence in journalism\\" by the University of Kansas, and became the first sports journalist ever to receive the National Press Foundation's highest honor, the W.M. Kiplinger Award for Distinguished Contributions to Journalism. Deford's archives are held by the University of Texas, where an annual lecture is presented in his name. He was a long-time advocate for research and treatment of cystic fibrosis. Life and career=Early life= Deford grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, the oldest of three sons, and attended the Calvert School and Gilman School in Baltimore. He is a graduate of Princeton University and resided in Key West, Florida, with his wife, the former Carol Penner, who had been a fashion model. They have two surviving children: Christian (b. 1969) and Scarlet (b. 1980). Scarlet was adopted as an infant from the Philippines a few months after his daughter Alexandra's death from cystic fibrosis at age 8 on January 19, 1980. Deford has two grandchildren; Annabel (b. 2010) and Hunter (b. 2012). Deford met his wife in Delaware and they were married in Newport, Rhode Island in 1965. =Career= After graduation from Princeton in 1962, Deford began his career as a researcher at Sports Illustrated. In addition to his writing at Sports Illustrated, he was a commentator on CNN and worked as a correspondent for HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel since 1995. He was a regular Wednesday commentator for NPR's Morning Edition from 1980 to 2016, when his essays became monthly until he retired in May 2017. His 1981 novel Everybody's All- American was named one of Sports Illustrated's Top 25 Sports Books of All Time and was later made into a film of the same title. Much of the fiction he wrote is set outside of the sports realm. His last novel was the acclaimed Bliss, Remembered, a 1930s romance between a pretty young American and the son of a German diplomat; the story is written from the point of view of the woman. He was also the screenwriter on the films Trading Hearts (1988) and Four Minutes (2005). In 1989, Deford became editor-in-chief of The National, the first daily U.S. sports newspaper. It ceased publication after only 18 months. After writing for Newsweek and Vanity Fair, Deford became a senior contributing writer at Sports Illustrated. =Advocacy= Deford served as chairman of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation from 1982 until 1999 and was chairman emeritus after that. He became a cystic-fibrosis advocate after his daughter Alexandra was diagnosed with the illness in 1972.

He was drafted in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons and also played for the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football at Ohio State University. Early years Jenkins attended A.P. Leto High School in Tampa, Florida where he was a record-breaking track star. He received many awards for his outstanding athletic performance, stellar academic achievement, and school leadership. College career Jenkins became a three-year starter for the Ohio State Buckeyes, starting 38 of his final 39 games, he caught 165 passes for 2,898 yards with a 17.6 average, and scored 16 touchdowns in his career. He finished his career with at least one reception in 38 consecutive games and helped the Buckeyes capture the 2002 BCS National Championship at the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. His 2,898 yards rank eighth on the Big Ten Conference career- record list, while also topping the previous school all-time record of 2,855 by David Boston. Jenkins earned an All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention as a senior after leading the team with 55 receptions for 834 yards with a 15.2 average and 7 touchdowns while adding 178 yards and a touchdown on 20 punt returns. He was also an All-Big Ten Conference second-team choice as a junior after leading the team with a career-high 61 receptions for 1,076 yards (17.6 average) and 6 touchdowns. During the 2002 Ohio State National championship season, Jenkins made one of the biggest and most memorable catches in Buckeye history, the \\"Holy Buckeye\\" play at Purdue. In the first overtime period of Ohio State's victory in the 2002 BCS National Championship game over the Miami Hurricanes, Jenkins caught a pass on 4th and 14 from Craig Krenzel that gave the Buckeyes a first down and eventually allowed the Buckeyes to prevail 31-24 in two overtimes.

His 17.0 average led the team and his eight special teams tackles ranked fourth. He made his first NFL reception for 46 yards against the Denver Broncos. =2005 season= With the slump and eventual release of wide receiver Peerless Price, the Falcons turned to Jenkins to start. Although Falcons quarterback Michael Vick turned to him more often, Jenkins was not a gigantic factor in the Falcons' less-than-stellar offense for the 2005 season. He played in 14 games and started 12 of them after Price left for the Dallas Cowboys. Jenkins made his first career start against the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the team with three grabs for 80 yards. He improved from his rookie season, catching 38 passes for 506 yards. He also caught three touchdowns, the first against the ailing Buffalo Bills. =2006 season= Jenkins started all 16 games for the first time in his career and registered 436 receiving yards on a then career-high 39 catches with a career- high seven touchdowns. He led the team with 77 receiving yards on 3 receptions (25.7 average), including a 34-yard touchdown catch in the season opener against the Carolina Panthers. =2007 season= Jenkins had 53 receptions for 532 yards and four touchdowns in his fourth year with the team. He tallied a season-high 76 receiving yards on six receptions against the Carolina Panthers and posted six catches for 64 yards with a career-high two touchdowns against the Houston Texans. Jenkins reached a career-high nine receptions for a team- high 73 yards against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and tied a career-high with nine grabs for a career-high 83 yards against the New Orleans Saints. =2008 season= Jenkins is matched up against Oakland Raiders cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha at a Falcons away game on November 2, 2008. Jenkins caught the first pass of rookie quarterback Matt Ryan's NFL career and took it for a 62-yard touchdown against the Detroit Lions. Jenkins caught a pass and ran out of bounds, stopping the clock with 1 second left and allowing Jason Elam to successfully convert a 48-yard field goal to defeat the Chicago Bears during their week 6 game. Jenkins set a new career high in receiving yards in 2008 with 777. =2009 season= Jenkins started for the Falcons in 2009. He finished the season with 50 receptions, 635 yards, and a touchdown. =2010 season= After suffering an injury in an offseason team scrimmage, Michael Jenkins would miss 4 to 6 weeks. As a result, Jenkins started just 9 regular season games for the Falcons in 2010, finishing with 41 receptions for 505 yards and 2 touchdown receptions. Atlanta finished with the best record in the NFC at 13-3, but the Falcons were upset by the eventual Super Bowl Champion Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Playoffs. In the 48-21 loss to Green Bay, Jenkins recorded 6 receptions for 67 yards. =2011 season= On July 29, 2011, Jenkins was released by the Atlanta Falcons. A day later, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He was placed on injured reserve on November 29, 2011. He caught 38 passes for 466 yards and scored 3 touchdowns during the season. =Minnesota Vikings= Jenkins was signed by the Vikings for a 3-year contract. In week 7 of that year, Jenkins caught a 72-yard pass on the first play of the game, only to be tackled at the 1 yard line. Jenkins had 38 receptions for 466 yards that season. The Vikings would go on to tie the worst season in franchise history, with a 3-13 record. =2012 season and playoffs= Jenkins returned with the Vikings in 2012. Minnesota was 9-6 in week 17 and had to beat the Green Bay Packers to advance to the playoffs. Jenkins caught a diving touchdown in the 4th quarter that gave the Vikings the lead. The Vikings would go on to win that game 37-34, only to lose to the Packers in the first round of playoffs the following week. On March 4, 2013, Jenkins was released by the Vikings. =New England Patriots= Jenkins signed with the New England Patriots on March 28, 2013. He was released on August 15, 2013.

In 1981, he joined Hewlett Packard Singapore where he remained till January 1985. Wong was elected a Member of Parliament representing the Kuo Chuan constituency in Toa Payoh at the 1984 general election. He has since been re-elected as an MP representing the Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) of Toa Payoh (1988), Thomson (1991) and Bishan‚ÄìToa Payoh (1997, 2001, 2006 and 2011).

He was concurrently appointed the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1988. In 1994, he became the Minister for Home Affairs. Wong also served as the Leader of the House in Singapore's Parliament from 1991 to 2007. Wong was vocal in his capacity as cabinet minister when it comes to defending any criticisms of the PAP as being authoritarian, or that the political process was undemocratic with an advantage given to the ruling party. He often described the opposition as being disorganised, weak and driven by self-interests. > \\"The public has no sympathy for them. Neither do I. Why should I? I mean, > they mess it up.\\" On opposition politician J.B. Jeyaretnam's proposal to establish an independent elections commission, Wong remarked, \\"It is absurd. I think we cannot be more democratic than we are now. We even allow a loser to be in Parliament and make speeches attacking the government. Where could you find such a democracy in other countries?\\" At the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, Wong argued that democracy was interpreted differently in Singapore. He claims that its citizens \\"do not agree that pornography is an acceptable manifestation of free expression or that homosexual relationships are just a matter of lifestyle choice.\\" Wong was also of the belief that excessive emphasis on individual rights over the rights of the community will retard progress. On 1 September 2005, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong appointed Wong as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers following the retirement of Tony Tan. On 1 November 2010, Wong was appointed the Co-ordinating Minister for National Security and relinquished his post as Minister for Home Affairs. Wong retired from the Cabinet following the 2011 general election.

Wong expressed his regret in Parliament the day after the occurrence. > \\"This should never have happened. I am sorry that it has.\\" He revealed that Mas Selamat escaped when he was taken to the toilet before a meeting at the detention centre's family visit room. Wong was criticised because news of Mas Selamat's escape was not disseminated to the public until four hours after its occurrence. There were calls for Wong to step down, given the severity of the security lapse. Mas Selamat was eventually recaptured in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, on 1 April 2009, by Malaysian authorities, over a year after his escape. SARS Wong was then responsible for co-ordinating the inter-ministerial nationwide effort to counter the SARS epidemic. Certain measures were taken to contain the virus, including mandatory home quarantine measures, health screening at immigration checkpoints, schools and hospitals and public education programs. On 31 May 2003, Singapore was taken off the World Health Organization's list of SARS-affected countries. Post-political career Wong returned to the private sector after stepping down from the cabinet. Wong was appointed as the chairman of Singbridge, a unit of Temasek Holdings, in 2011.

During the 1960s and 1970s he was one of the world's strongest players and reached the 1977‚Äì78 Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship, but never qualified for a competition for the actual title. Hort was born in Kladno, Czechoslovakia and was a citizen of Czechoslovakia for the first part of his chess career. He achieved the Grandmaster title in 1965. He won a number of major international tournaments (Hastings 1967‚Äì68, Skopje 1969, etc.) and national championships (1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, and 1977). He gained recognition as one of the strongest non-Soviet players in the world, which led to him representing the \\"World\\" team in the great \\"USSR vs. Rest of the World\\" match of 1970, where he occupied fourth board and had an undefeated +1 score against the Soviet Grandmaster Lev Polugaevsky‚Äîin some respects his greatest result. He defected to the West in 1985, moving to West Germany and winning the national championship of his new homeland in 1987, 1989, and 1991. Chess career=Zonals and interzonals= Grandmaster Vlastimil Hort giving a simultaneous exhibition, 1997 Hort participated in a number of Zonal and Interzonal qualifying tournaments to select a challenger for the world title, generally with good results but without reaching the final stages of the Candidates process. =Sousse Interzonal 1967= The 1967 Interzonal tournament at Sousse included among its participants not only Hort, but also the great but volatile Bobby Fischer. While leading the tournament, Fischer was involved in a dispute with the tournament organizers regarding playing schedule that resulted in his forfeiting a game with the Soviet player Aivars Gipslis. While accounts of subsequent events differ, it is clear that he was persuaded to resume play, but then did not appear for his game with Hort, who was awarded a victory by forfeit. Negotiations with the organizers went downhill from this point, and Fischer withdrew from the tournament to begin his penultimate estrangement from grandmaster chess. Hort went on to finish the Interzonal in a tie for sixth with Samuel Reshevsky and Leonid Stein, but did not advance to the Candidates matches, Reshevsky becoming the successful Candidate following a three-way tie-breaking match. = Candidates matches 1977‚Äì78 = He reached the stage of the Candidates matches of 1977‚Äì78 but was eliminated in the first round, in a close match versus the former world champion Boris Spassky. Hort's long-standing reputation as one of the great sportsmen of chess was enhanced by an event during this match. During the latter stages of the competition, Spassky fell ill and was unable to play. During Candidates matches, each player was allotted a fixed number of rest days to accommodate such situations, but Spassky exhausted his entire allocation of time-outs yet was still unable to compete. At this point Hort could have claimed the match won by forfeit; however, he offered Spassky one of his own time-outs so that the ex-champion could complete his recovery. Spassky did so and went on to win the match by the narrowest possible margin, eliminating Hort from that Candidates cycle. In the penultimate game of the match Hort had established a clearly winning position, but forgot about the clock, and sat thinking until his time elapsed, handing the win to Spassky. With a draw in the next and final game, Spassky won the match. The following day Hort gave what was then a world record simultaneous exhibition in which he took on over 600 opponents. He explained that he gave the exhibition in order to get the loss against Spassky out of his head. Hort in 2005 = Olympiad career = Hort played for Czechoslovakia in the Chess Olympiads of 1960, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1980, 1982, 1984, and for Germany in 1988, 1990, 1992. = Simultaneous play = In 1985, he played a simultaneous exhibition against 636 opponents in Cologne, which earned him an entry in The Guinness Book of Records. =Later career= Hort has appeared numerous times as chess commentator alongside grandmaster Helmut Pfleger on German TV. Despite advancing age he has remained an active tournament competitor, representing the unified Germany and playing inter alia on \\"Veterans\\" teams in Scheveningen system matches against teams of Woman Grandmasters. In 2006 he became Senior World Champion in Chess 960.

Instead, it consists of software that coalesces results from a data store, which may be a database or a custom index, and presents them visually in the format in which folder views are presented. A virtual folder can be thought of as a view that lists all files tagged with a certain tag, and thus a simulation of a folder whose dynamic contents can be assembled on the fly, when requested. It is related in concept to several other topics in computer science, with names including saved search, saved query, and filtering.  Technology  Virtual folders provide a means for making it easier for users to find files that are content-related, such as by project. The user needs to specify criteria and all files matching the criteria are dynamically aggregated into the virtual folder. Files in a virtual folder are not limited to any single physical location on the hard drive, as is the case with traditional folders, but can be in any location. In fact, files in a virtual folder do not even need to be stored as files on the hard drive. They may be on a network share or in a custom application datastore such as e-mail inbox or even a database. Documents cannot be \\"stored\\" in a virtual folder, since physically a virtual folder is just a file storing a search query. Any attempt to store a file in a virtual folder, depending on the implementation, is redirected to some physical store. Most implementations speed up searching by pre-indexing the hard drive, or the locations where the search has to be performed. So when searching is to be done, the index, which is a representation of the entire data suitable for fast searching, is used. Since the entire folder hierarchy is not accessed, the search is completed much faster.  Implementations  Virtual folders are a well-established construct in operating systems. BeOS included a version of virtual folders referred to as \\"saved queries\\", that has since influenced the development of virtual folder features in operating systems like Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. These virtual folders are populated dynamically by executing a search on the entire file system, or a subset of it, or by using the cached version of the search.  History = BeOS = The initial developer preview of the operating system, released in October 1995, included database-like functionality to make it easier for users to manage their files. To do this the filesystem indexes certain file attributes to allow for fast searching. By default the filesystem indexes the filename, size and last modified timestamp automatically, but could also create indexes for other attributes when told to by either an application or by the user. When a user performs a file search, a file is created in the folder \\"/boot/home/queries\\" with a name derived from the content of the query and the date and time of the search, such as \\"Name = Western Infirmary - Mar 21, 11:59:40 PM\\". The query criteria of the search is stored in an attribute of the file called \\"qrystr\\". When the file is opened, the filesystem indexes were queried and a Tracker window is opened with an up- to-date list of files that match the criteria. Additional features were added to search with subsequent releases. Release 2 introduced the ability to edit saved queries, and Release 3 gave the users the chance to define their own names for saved queries. Before Release 4 in 1998, all queries were stored indefinitely. However, with R4, the BeOS developers introduced a seven-day limit on all queries. If a user wanted a query to stay around longer, they could uncheck a \\"Temporary\\" flag in the Find dialog. = macOS = In April 2005, Apple released Mac OS X v10.4, with their implementation of virtual folders called Smart Folders. These folders are dynamically updated by the Spotlight engine to contain content that match certain criteria. For example, this could be used to give you a folder containing all the Word documents containing the word \\"shpadoinkle\\" that have been edited within the last 7 days. Smart Folders are created by saving a Spotlight search, which records the search criteria in a Property list file with a .savedSearch extension and, by default, saves them in the \\"/Users/username/Library/Saved Searches\\" folder. Dominic Giampaolo, One of the lead developers of the BeOS filesystem,was also involved in adding a virtual folder system in Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system. There are many variants of the Smart Folder concept that can be seen in applications that use the Spotlight engine, usually identified by a gear symbol on a purple-hued icon. Examples include: Smart Mailboxes in Mail and Smart Groups in Address Book. Before Spotlight earlier versions of macOS had a similar concept in the iApps (iTunes and iPhoto), but these did not use the system-wide Spotlight engine. = Microsoft Windows = A Search Folder (virtual folder) is recognizable in Windows Vista by its distinctive icon and blue color. In November 2006, Microsoft released Windows Vista which allows users to save any search query as a Search Folder, a type of virtual folder. Search Folders are designed so that users are not required to remember where their files are stored. A Search Folder is not a physical folder, but is essentially an XML file that stores a defined query in a form that can be used by the Windows Search subsystem. Because of this, a Search Folder can be created anywhere that a normal folder can be created. A similar approach exists in Windows XP when the Windows Indexing Service is enabled, as a search can be saved as a .fnd file. However, a saved search query in Windows XP only saves a user's search criteria; users must still specify the location and perform the search again as results are not dynamic. Search Folder, which is Windows Vista's implementation of a virtual folder, is physically just an XML file, which contains the search query, in a \`.search-ms\` file. Whenever a Search Folder is accessed, it returns results that are relevant to a saved search query; results manifest themselves as actual files and folders in storage. Search queries can be defined based on a number of parameters and properties, including all or part of a filename, specific dates, the content of the files themselves, associated metadata, specific file types, where files are located, and various other attributes. A feature called Query Composition allows searches to be based on other Search Folders to further refine results. Windows Vista, by default, references the profile of the user who originally created a saved search as part of the query's scope, which includes the disk partition. This design choice does not prevent saved searches from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different partitions or user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author or location, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user. From left-to-right, the Search Folders for documents, pictures and videos, and music that appear in the navigation pane of Windows Vista Beta 1. In early development builds of Windows Vista, there existed pre-configured Search Folders for the default user profile folders (e.g., Documents, Music, and Pictures) that replaced the links to these folders seen on the Windows Start menu. When browsing directories in Windows Explorer, the navigation pane would feature predefined Search Folders that were relevant to a currently viewed directory. When viewing the Documents folder, for example, the navigation pane would populate with individual Search Folders based on authors of documents, their ratings, their keywords, their types, and documents that were recently changed. Pre-release builds later included subqueries that aggregated content from a main Library Search Folder. Microsoft's stated aim with this approach was to move beyond the traditional physical folder concept, but the company received a considerable amount of feedback from users who found that the new Search Folder-based approach was too confusing. In particular, the Search Folders being located on the Start menu led to the belief that there existed multiple physical folders with similar names and content. As a result of this feedback, the company reinstated the links to the physical folders on the Start menu, in a manner similar to how they appear in previous versions of Windows, and removed several of the Search Folders that were available prior to Windows Vista's release to manufacturing. In spite of the feature being less prominent within the interface, the operating system does include several preconfigured Search Folders: Recent Documents, Recent E-mail, Recent Music, Recent Pictures and Videos, Recently Changed, and Shared By Me, all of which are powered by a single Indexed Locations Search Folder, which realizes the previous Library concept. In Windows 7, the concept of virtual folders has been significantly realized with the introduction of the Libraries feature. Similar to Saved Searches, a Library is simply an XML file but with the \`.library-ms\` extension and is essentially a collection of files with specified attributes presented in a familiar folder-style visual interface. Libraries have a shell namespace extension in Explorer and their XML files can be reused across Windows installations or the network. = GNOME = A saved search in GNOME 2.14In GNOME 2.14, a saved search is a virtual folder whose contents are the result of a Nautilus search, which has multiple backends. The contents of these folders are determined dynamically when the folder is opened, and updated automatically when files are created or modified. = Other implementations = Email clients  Virtual folders are also a well-established construct in email clients. In early 1991, the Emacs-based mail reader VM provided a virtual folder facility in its version 5.09. VM allows the users to define virtual folders using rules, taking their mail content from one or more physical folders and based on selection criteria dealing with dates, authors, recipient, subject, message body etc. Virtual folders can also be created interactively and take content from previously defined virtual folders, thereby cascading the selection criteria. The Evolution email client created by Helix Code in 2000, also incorporated virtual folders. Folders can be created that automatically list e-mails matching user-defined rules, for example all e-mail from a particular address or all e-mail that includes a specific keyword. The Opera web browser released a new mail client (beta in November 2002, final version in Jan 2003), M2 in which virtual folders (called access points) were used for all email management. Virtual folders were automatically made for active contacts, for attachments and for assigned labels. Virtual folders were also automatically generated whenever a search was performed, and manual virtual folders could use multiple logical mail header rules for their construction (including using regular expressions). Microsoft Outlook 2003 added a similar feature called Search Folders. Gmail, first released in 2004, bases all of its mail management on virtual folders accessed via labels. Mozilla Thunderbird also has the ability to create search folders and from version 1.5 allowed the search to be done over more than one email account.  Music clients  In July 2002, Apple announced version 3 of iTunes which includes Smart Playlists which can be considered a variant of a virtual folder. The only difference is that the search executed on accessing them is not on the file system's folder hierarchy, but on their internal data-store. Microsoft also added a similar feature to version 9 of Windows Media Player in Windows XP called Auto Playlists in 2003.

The South Col is typically swept by high winds, leaving it free of significant snow accumulation. Since 1950 (when Tibet was closed), most Everest expeditions have left from Nepal and gone via the southeast ridge and the South Col (instead of via the North Col). When climbers attempt to climb Everest from the southeast ridge in Nepal, their final camp (usually Camp IV) is situated on the South Col. The South Col was first reached on May 12, 1952 by Aubert, Lambert, and Flory of Edouard Wyss-Dunant's Swiss Mount Everest Expedition that failed to reach the summit. The following year, when Mount Everest was first climbed, Wilfrid Noyce and the Sherpa Annullu were the first climbers on the expedition to reach the col. According to John Hunt, the expedition leader: Mount Everest. The South Col is the lowest point of the sunny ridge on the right side Once on the South Col, climbers have entered the death zone; altitude sickness is a significant threat at this elevation and can easily prove fatal. It is also difficult to sleep, and most climbers' digestive systems have significantly slowed or completely stopped. This is because it is more efficient at this altitude for the body to use stored energy sources than to digest new food. Most climbers will begin using supplemental oxygen here and have a maximum of only two or three days for making summit bids. Clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp. Climbers rarely get a second chance to return to the South Col in a specific expedition. In 2005, Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the South Col. Two days later he made the first helicopter landing on the summit of Mount Everest, a feat he subsequently repeated. In May 2019, the highest weather station in the world was installed at Everest, with one location at the South Col, and another on a place higher up on the peak known as \\"The Balcony\\" as well as some other stations and locations. The weather stations are about tall and weigh .

He played the didgeridoo, keyboards, melodica, sampler, and various percussion instruments with his groups, the Oxford-based Outback and Dr. Didg. Physics Graham Wiggins was born on 25 October 1962 in New York City, United States. Wiggins held a D.Phil in solid-state physics from Oxford University, where he earned his nickname Dr. Didg while testing his didgeridoo in the Clarendon physics laboratory. He helped develop new technology for Siemens MRI scanners, including a 32 channel head coil. Musical career Wiggins was born in New York to an Australian mother and a British father from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and grew up in New York. He graduated from Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, NY in 1980. Although his first instruments were piano and horn, he first taught himself to play the didgeridoo while a physics student at Boston University in 1982, after hearing Warren Senders demonstrating a cardboard-tube didgeridoo as part of a \\"world music\\" concert series in Boston. He graduated from Boston University in 1985, relocating to Oxford, England for postgraduate study. In order to earn extra money there to complete his doctorate he also performed as a busking didgeridoo player. In 1983 Wiggins invented a keyed version of the didgeridoo, which allows it to be played melodically somewhat in the manner of an ophicleide, a keyed brass instrument which Wiggins was able to try at the Bate Collection, a musical instrument museum at Oxford University's Faculty of Music in St Aldate's, Oxford. The first prototype was made out of a cardboard wrapping paper tube and had first only one, then four valves, allowing the instrument to play a total of five distinct pitches. He used it in only one concert, after which it fell apart. He refined this model in 1990, using the machine tools at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. It is made from weng√© (an African hardwood) with brass hardware. It has eight keys, which allows for the playing of nine different pitches. He unveiled it publicly for the first time on the British national television program called Tomorrow's World. The instrument may be heard on several Dr. Didg tracks, most notably \\"Sub Aqua,\\" on the 2002 CD Dust Devils, as well as \\"Sun Tan,\\" on the 1994 CD Out of the Woods. In 1988, he formed the core of Outback with guitarist Martin Cradick, a band that blended Australian tribal sounds with modern music. He obtained a record deal before completing his thesis. Following the dissolution of that group in 1991, he spent two months in early 1992 living in the Aboriginal community of Galiwinku on Elcho Island, off the coast of Arnhem Land, in Australia's Northern Territory, where he studied the advanced traditional didgeridoo techniques of the area. With the exception of a few songs such as \\"Brolga,\\" Wiggins' compositions are generally not based primarily on traditional Aboriginal structures, but instead on the use of the instrument's percussive, rhythmic, and melodic capabilities. In 1993, Wiggins formed the group Dr. Didg. In 1994, he began using the technique of live sampling, which became the foundation of the Dr. Didg album Out of the Woods. Wiggins played with the Grateful Dead in 1993 at the Mardi Gras show at the Oakland Coliseum in California, and recorded with Mickey Hart on the albums Mickey Hart's Mystery Box and Supralingua as part of the Grammy Award-winning ensemble Planet Drum. After a few years hiatus, Dr. Didg began touring again in 2010, including performances at the All Good Music Festival at Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia, and Meeting of the Minds III in Poyntelle, Pennsylvania. After 15 years living in Oxford, Wiggins moved back to Boston in the spring of 2000. In September 2016, Wiggins died at the age of 53.
