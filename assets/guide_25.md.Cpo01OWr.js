Boyd was the oldest son (with a twin brother) of Lt Colonel Boyd Francis Alexander. On his mother's side he was the grandson of David Wilson the founder of the Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta. He was born at Swifts Park at Cranbrook in Kent and educated at Radley and Sandhurst. Alexander was commissioned in a Militia battalion of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), and in October 1900 took up a commission in a regular battalion of that regiment. Promotion to lieutenant followed on 22 January 1902. During 1902 he visited the Gold Coast Colony, where he made an ornithological survey of that colony, and in September that year he left for the Bonin Islands to investigate their avifauna. Lieutenant Alexander was a member of an expedition which travelled across Africa from the Niger to the Nile, exploring the Lake Chad area. Alexander was accompanied by his brother Claud, Captain G. B. Gosling and Portuguese collector Jos√© Lopes. In February 1904 they set off from the mouth of the Niger, travelling upriver to Lokoja. Claud died in October of enteric fever after making a survey of the Murchison Range. Boyd and Gosling explored the area around Lake Chad. Gosling died in June 1906 at Niangara of blackwater fever. Boyd then followed the River Kibali, reaching the Nile late in the year and returning to England in February 1907. Alexander's account From The Niger To The Nile was published later that year.

The population in 2011 was 15,038 in an area of The city of Horta itself has a population of about 7,000. Horta's marina is a primary stop for yachts crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and its walls and walkways are covered with paintings created by visitors noting the names of their vessels, crews, and the years they visited. Peter's Cafe Sport is a bar located across from the marina that houses the island's scrimshaw museum, a collection of artifacts carved from whale tooth and jawbone. Peter's is a point of reference for transatlantic yachters and sailors. History =15th through 17th centuries= The Bay of Horta showing the main settlement as it appeared in 1589 In 1467 the Flemish nobleman Josse van Huerter returned to Faial on a second expedition, this time disembarking along the shore of what would be known as Horta Bay. He built a small chapel which would later form the nucleus of a small community known as Horta, a name possibly derived from the transliteration of his name. In the Portuguese language the word horta means \\"orchard,\\" another possible origin of the settlement's name. The infante D. Fernando, Duke of Viseu, granted Huerter the first captaincy of the island on February 2, 1468. Unlike on other Azorean islands, Flemish peasants and business interests were not the first settlers of Faial. The first Faialense settlers were generally farmers from continental Portugal‚Äîparticularly northern Portugal‚Äîhoping to escape poverty. Huerter eventually cultivated new business opportunities in Flanders, attracting a second wave of Flemish settlers under the stewardship of Willem van der Haegen (later transliterated to Guilherme da Silveira), who brought Flemish administrators, tradesmen, settlers, and other compatriots to settle on Faial. Huerter's son Joss de Utra (who would become the second Captain-General) and his daughter D. Joana de Macedo (who married Martin Behaim at the Santa Cruz chapel) continued living on Faial long after van Huerter‚Äôs death. In 1498 King Manuel I of Portugal decreed Horta elevated to the status of vila (town), as its center had grown to the north from the area around the Santa Cruz chapel. The island prospered by exporting wheat and woad-derived dyes. On June 28, 1514, the parish of Matriz do S√£o Salvador da Horta was constituted and services were begun. In 1567 the cornerstone of what would be the Fort of Santa Cruz was laid. Horta's increasing population compelled the creation of the parishes of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o (July 30, 1568) and Nossa Senhora da Angustias (November 28, 1684) by the diocese of Angra. As two nuclei developed around Santa Cruz and Porto Pim, growth also extended around the older Matriz, where the Tower Clock now stands, and the public square, where Alameda Bar√£o de Roches now exists. Public buildings were erected between Rua Visconde Leite Perry and Rua Arriage Nunes and eventually the town hall and court offices moved to the former Jesuit College, after the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal in 1758. In 1583‚Äîduring the beginning of the Iberian Union‚ÄîSpanish soldiers under the command of D. Pedro de Toledo landed in Pasteleiro on Faial's southwestern coast. After skirmishing at the doors of the fort, the Spanish executed Captain of Faial Ant√≥nio Guedes de Sousa. Four years later George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland‚Äîwhile commanding a fleet of 13 British ships in the Azores Voyage of 1589‚Äîcaptured a Spanish ship and then plundered Faial's churches and convents, profaning them and destroying reliquaries and crucifixes. The British captured several artillery pieces and set fire to houses within the Fort of Santa Cruz. In 1597 a new British force under Walter Raleigh, second in command to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, sacked and burned religious buildings and churches in Horta and the neighboring parishes of Flamengos, Feteira, and Praia do Almoxarife. The constant threat of privateers and pirates forced the construction of several forts and lookouts. In 1643, Horta had about 2579 inhabitants and 610 homes. In 1675 D. Frei Louren√ßo, Bishop of Angra, authorized the renovation and re-ornamentation of the chapel of Santa Cruz. This work was completed in 1688. =18th and 19th centuries= During the 18th and 19th centuries, Horta was a small town extending along the shoreline. It was peppered by various convents and churches, but little commerce and almost no industry. However, due to its central location in the Azores and Atlantic Ocean, it prospered as a stopover on important commercial routes between Europe and the Americas. For a time Horta was a center of commerce and travel, particularly as a gateway for Azorean orange exports and exports of wine from Pico Island, as well as an important stop for North American whalers, and later as a refueling port for coal-powered ships during their transatlantic passages. A vista of the village of Horta, Faial from the New Bedford Whaling Museum, c.1842 (Purrington & Russel) In 1804 John Bass Dabney (1766‚Äì1826), the United States Consul General in the Azores, married Roxanne Lewis and moved to a home in Horta. Their son Charles William Dabney (who later married Francis Alsop Pomeroy) succeeded his father in this position and played an important part in the history and economy of Horta and Faial. This was helped by the construction of a commercial port in 1876 and the installation of transatlantic telegraph cables in 1893. The Dabney family steered the island's economy for 83 years with good effect on the dynamic growth of the port, the export of oranges and Verdelho wine from Pico, and commerce related to the whaling industry. On September 26, 1814, the American privateer brig General Armstrong, under the command of Samuel Chester Reid, was sunk by three ships of the British Royal Navy under the command of Robert Lloyd. After being forced to scuttle his ship, Reid formally protested the ship's destruction in a neutral port, criticizing Portuguese incapacity to defend their own waters. Her principal piece of naval artillery, the cannon \\"Long Tom\\", was later recovered from Horta Bay. It was eventually offered to General Batcheller, the United States Minister in Lisbon, in compensation. General Batcheller returned to Horta to pick up the cannon and delivered it to New York City on board the ship USS Vega on or about April 18, 1893. On July 4, 1833, the vila of Horta, through the initiative of the Duke d'√Åvila and Bolama, was elevated to the status of city and the district capital as a reward for Faial's support of Liberal forces during the Portuguese Liberal Revolution. The city hall's coat of arms were changed to read ‚ÄúMy Loyal City of Horta‚Äù by decree of King Lu√≠s I of Portugal on May 3, 1865. Construction of Horta's commercial port in 1876 increased the city's international importance. On August 23, 1893, the first telegraph cables linking Horta (Alagoa) and Lisbon (Carcavelos) made Horta a link in transatlantic communication. The presence of several foreign cable companies in Horta increased the economic activity and development, urban growth, and frequency of cultural and sporting activities on the island. Between 1893 and 1969 Horta was an important post in intercontinental communications. = 20th century = A view of Horta harbour from the German battleship before the outbreak of World War II Horta entered into the annals of early aviation history when United States Navy Captain Albert Cushing Read completed the first Atlantic leg of the first transatlantic flight when he landed his Curtiss NC-4 floatplane in the Bay of Horta in May 1919. In 1921 Dutch seagoing tugboats began using Horta as a stopover. After a hiatus during World War II, they returned during the period of European reconstruction. After 1939 Horta was a scheduled waypoint on the transatlantic flying boat routes between North America and Europe, including the Pan Am Clipper fleet which docked in Horta harbour. By 1960 yachts started using Horta‚Äôs sheltered port during transatlantic voyages. On 24 August 1971, in the civil parish of Castelo Branco, President of Portugal Am√©rico Tom√°s inaugurated the Horta Airport. Since 1972 the Sociedade A√ßoreana de Transportes Aer√©os (which was the forerunner of SATA Air Azores) has provided scheduled flights from Horta to the islands of the triangle (Central Group). During the 1980s TAP Air Portugal, the national flag carrier, established direct service from Horta to Lisbon, while further fleet improvements allowed SATA to directly link Horta with all Azorean islands. Following major renovations in December 2001, the airport was designated an international airport, although no foreign airlines have scheduled or charter flights arriving at Horta Airport. Periodic improvements to Horta harbour allowed the city to become a stopover for yachts and cruise ships and provide ongoing assistance to transatlantic voyagers. This was facilitated when the municipal authority inaugurated a 300-slip marina on 3 June 1986. Horta harbour is a fleet centre for the Azorean ferry lines Transma√ßor and Atlanticoline, resulting in new investments and the construction of a secondary pier for inter-island passenger traffic. Geography =Physical geography= =Climate= Horta has the typical humid subtropical climate associated with the Azores, with significant oceanic influences, due to the August mean temperature just being above the isotherm separating the classifications under the K√∂ppen system. Horta is the Azorean city most prone to high temperatures, and unlike Angra do Hero√≠smo and Ponta Delgada temperatures above have been recorded on a few occasions. However, averages are extremely similar to the aforementioned cities. Precipitation averages about per year and is concentrated in the winter months. On average December is the wettest month, while July is the driest. This makes Horta, like much of the Azores, more similar to Mediterranean (Koppen Csa/Csb) climates in its annual precipitation cycle than most other humid subtropical climates. =Human geography= Three parishes comprise the urban area of the city of Horta (the urbanized area and historical center): Ang√∫stias, Concei√ß√£o, and Matriz. The remaining parishes comprising the rest of the municipality are located along the Regional E.R.1-1¬™ road network, and includes lands from the ocean to the central volcano (with the exception of Flamengos, which is the only landlocked parish). Faial Island, comprising Horta's urbanized area and the parishes, has an area of * Capelo - located in the western portion of the island that includes the most recent historic volcanism on the island; location of the Capelinhos Volcano and Recreational Forest Park * Castelo Branco - located on the southern coastal area between Capelo and Feteiras; location of Horta International Airport * Cedros - largest civil parish and agricultural lands, located on the northern coast between Capelo and Sal√£o * Feteira - southern parish located between the urbanized core of Horta and Castelo Branco; primarily agricultural activities in transition into suburban community of Horta * Flamengos - the only landlocked civil parish on the island, established by original settlers from the Low Countries of Europe * Pedro Miguel - located to the north of Praia do Almoxarife, along the eastern coast * Praia do Almoxarife - original settlers disembarked along the beach of Praia do Almoxarife during the original 1465 and 1467 expeditions; currently the main tourist beach community on the island * Praia do Norte - located between Cedros and Capelo, a zone affected by historic volcanism from the Capelo Volcanic Complex * Ribeirinha - a civil parish occupying the ancient geological zone that formed the island of Faial * Sal√£o - settled by Spanish during the Iberian Union, and located between Cedros and Ribeirinha In 2011, the national census discovered a resident population of 15,038: a slight decrease from the 2001 population (15,063 inhabitants). Yet, the number of aggregate families grew significantly (4795 to 5465 families reporting their participation in such groups), an increase from 2.8 to 3.1 people per family. Similarly, there has been a 21.69% increase in the number occupied buildings within the municipality. City of Horta Horta and its marina from Monte da Guia Carmo Church (right background) :\\"I love Horta like loquats! I had a longing of what was, I don't know how, of here. Everything imagined is more or less frustrated when we comprehend: but in Horta, no, it is exceeded. At the end of the Rua do Mar are the built-up homes; over the unique celebretated road of the town are the alleyways that descend to the coast and provide a modest contribution to the fires and transit.\\" (Vitorino Nem√©sio, O Cors√°rio das Ilhas) From Espalamaca or Monte da Guia, the city of Horta is typical of insular Portuguese coastal communities and the urban traditions of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The city is seaward looking, much like Angra do Hero√≠smo or Velas. It is rounded by several volcanic cones located to its southern and eastern margins, the most prominent being Monte da Guaia, Monte do Carneiro, and Monte Escuro. Horta is centered along its principal avenue‚Äîreferred to as either Avenida Marginal or Avenida D. Infante Henriques‚Äîand cut by several smaller roads. The city's historical center lies to the north near Espalamaca, with a grouping of north-south and east-west roads developed during initial colonization. The population of Horta's urban center during the first decade of the 21st century was about 7,000. Horta grew from streets such as: * Rua Vista Alegre/Ladeira da Paiva/travessa Almeida Garrett (that includes the Church Matriz, and Convent of Saint John); * Rua Advogado Gra√ßa/Travessa do Poiso Novo (where the original Casa da C√¢mara and Convent of Glory were situated); * Rua de S√£o Paulo; * Rua de S√£o Pedro and Travessa da Miseric√≥rdia; and, * Rua Dr. Azevedo and Cal√ßada M. Vila, near the entrance to the Largo do Col√©gio. * Rua de S√£o Jo√£o * Rua Ten. Arag√£o (currently between the Imp√©rio dos Nobres and the Sociedade Amor da P√°tria) * Rua da Concei√ß√£o/Alameda Bar√£o de Roches/Rua D. Pedro IV/Rua E. Rebelo, with the Pelourinho, the Casa da C√¢mara and older urban prison (Cadeia), the Convent of Glory, this area constituted the original Vila of Horta. The oldest dwellings and the older ornate fa√ßades are located in this area. * Rua Maestro Simaria, located near the Rua Serpa Pinto, and the ancient Largo do Col√©gio Jesu√≠ta; * Rua Conselheiro Miguel da Silveira, and open to the Avenida Marginal. These streets formed from the central colony along hills parallel to each other and perpendicular to the ocean. Littoral growth was made cautiously until the town square, civic center, town hall, and local water wells were built along the seashore in both directions. Religious institutions generally mark the extent of urbanized‚Äìrural limits (as the Convent of Nossa Senhora do Carmo and Convent of the Capuchos do today to the northeast). Modern Horta grew beyond the limits of this early colonization. A secondary nucleus grew in the area of Porto Pim, and infilling occurred sporadically until a crescent formed along the banks of the east coast, only contained by Ponte de Espalamaca to the north and open ocean to the south. The cinder cones in the south likely protected settlers and ships from the north Atlantic weather systems. Horta grew slowly into the river valleys of Faial's interior, linking the parishes of Flamengos to the west and Feteira to the southwest to form an incomplete urbanized mass. The nodes of growth basically follow the road network, including the recently completed \\"Scute\\" (freeway) that bypasses the southern E.R.1-1¬™ road between Angustias and Feteira. Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities Horta is twinned with: * New Bedford, Massachusetts, United States * Fremont, California, United States * Santa Cruz, Madeira, Portugal Economy The pier and seawalls in Horta Harbor and Marina are covered with the \\"calling cards\\" of visiting yachts. An example of one of the murals painted on the Marina seawall, showing the ensign of the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service Due to its central position in the Triangle of islands in the Azores's Central Group, Horta has been the focus of economic activity on Faial. It was the staging and export centre for many of the economic cycles of the region: the export of woad-derived dyes, oranges, whale oil, and Pico-grown Verdelho wines historically built Faial's economy. Many of the landed gentry concentrated their shops, production facilities, and homes in the city, while agricultural goods were shipped to the city before being sent on to Europe or North America. For a long time, the island of Pico was an exclave of Horta with summer homes, agricultural parcels, and herds owned by residents of Faial, until its emancipation on 8 March 1723. After the failure of the economic cycles through boom-and-bust economies (brought on by weather, plant disease, or market deviation), the city of Horta became a staging point for transatlantic shipment firstly for whaling fleets, and later for the submarine cable companies that laid communication lines between Europe and North America. These spurts of growth concentrated the population and political and economic classes within Horta, and economic activities on Faial. Horta today is polarized between the same dichotomy that existed between the hinter- and heartlands, with most primary economic activities (agricultural mostly) dispersed into the parishes, while the secondary and tertiary activities are concentrated in the three main parishes (Ang√∫stias, Concei√ß√£o and Matriz). In addition, the prosperity of the early 20th century, concentrated on the transatlantic traffic, has developed into a tourist-oriented economy concentrated on the architecture, geographic, leisure, and sociocultural aspects of the island. This includes sightseeing tours and whale-watching expeditions departing from the city, the arrival of semi-weekly cruise ships during the summer,and cultural festivals that unite local residents and visitors throughout the year. Transportation The island is circled by the Regional E.R.1-1¬™ roadway which directly connects all parish centres (except Flamengos) with the city Horta. Apart from personal vehicles, a bus system provides daily access to the city from the outer parishes. The centre of most activity in the municipality is Horta's port and passenger terminal which, until 28 July 2012, was located south of the Fort of Santa Cruz in the parish of Angustias. The passenger ferries operated by Transma√ßor (the Cruzeiro do Canal and Cruzeiro da Ilha) provided passenger service to and from the island of Pico (Madalena), while Atl√¢nticoline (using contracted ships) provided inter-island service to the remaining islands from the main dock across the harbour. On 28 July 2012, a new passenger ferry and dock was inaugurated across the harbour at the mouth of the Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o across from the old District Courthouse. A ‚Ç¨33 million project, the dock was started in 2009, and resulted in a long wharf, with a long by wide usable docking space containing two ramps for roll-on/roll-off operation, with the express purpose of supporting passenger traffic within the triangle islands of the central Azores. A long embankment in area was also built to protect the Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o. The project involved changes to the road network in the area, parking areas, pavement and green-spaces, as well as new public illumination, water supply, telecommunications, and fueling resources. In addition to these improvements, Transma√ßor acquired two new ships to be brought into service by the end of 2014 in order to support the island's tourist economy. At the new wharf's inauguration, President of the Azorean Regional Government Carlos Cesar indicated the importance of inter-island traffic for the islands, which for 16 years had transported 290,000 passengers annually (and now is beyond 400,000). In literature The city contains the Horta Regional Museum which has a permanent exhibit, Exhibition of Capelinhos Volcano, detailing in photographs the 1957 volcanic eruption in the Azores. The museum also contains a large collection of scale models of buildings, ships, and people carved from fig kernels by Euclides Rosa. Mark Twain visited Horta in June 1867 near the beginning of a long pleasure excursion to Jerusalem. He described his visit with acerbic commentary on the people and culture of Horta in his semi- autobiographical book The Innocents Abroad. In the book Twain compliments Horta's physical appearance: :The town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheatre of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear to their summits - not a foot of soil left idle. However, Twain painted a less complimentary picture of the inhabitants of Horta and Faial at the time: :The group on the pier was a rusty one ‚Äî men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. :The community is eminently Portuguese ‚Äî that is to say, it is slow, poor, shiftless, sleepy, and lazy. There is a civil governor, appointed by the King of Portugal; and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure. [...] there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep...There is not a wheelbarrow in the land [...] There is not a modern plow in the islands, or a threshing-machine. All attempts to introduce them have failed. The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him. [...] The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead. The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep with. Joshua Slocum, sailing the sloop Spray, stopped in Horta on the first leg of his solo global circumnavigation, which he chronicled in his 1899 book Sailing Alone Around the World. Jules Verne mentioned Horta in his fictional tales. In works by Portuguese writers Vitorino Nem√©sio (O Cors√°rio das Ilhas) and Raul Brand√£o (As ilhas Desconhecidas), Faial is a focus of the story.

Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other Nicotiana species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither pubescent nor sticky like Nicotiana tabacum. It resembles Cestrum parqui but differs in the form of leaves and fusion of the outer floral parts. It grows to heights of more than two meters. Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats. The plant is used for a variety of medicinal purposes and smoked by Native American groups. The Cahuilla people used leaves interchangeably with other tobacco species in hunting rituals and as a poultice to treat swellings, bruises, cuts, wounds, boils, sores, inflamed throat, and swollen glands. It contains the toxic alkaloid anabasine and ingestion of the leaves can be fatal. It is being investigated for use as a biofuel.

History Ellesmere Canal is the name of the area were the canal joins the river Mersey; by the mid-1790s it was known as Ellesmere Port. Docks and warehouses were built to facilitate this. thumb Between 1830 and the 1840s facilities were improved by the engineer Thomas Telford and others. In 1846 the Ellesmere Canal was amalgamated with the Shropshire Union Canal. In 1892 a new wharf was built to handle traffic on the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1921 the docks were leased to the Manchester Ship Canal, and this led to the decline of Ellesmere Port. 20th Century The site is now the National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port (formerly known as the Boat Museum). 21st Century In 2007, as part of a revival of some industries, ports and shipbuilding in Britain, Ellesmere Port docks were re-opened. In 2008 the site of Ellesmere Port's operational dock - including over of the waterfront area (immediately to the north-west of Ellesmere Port Historic Dock and Conservation Area and to the south-east of the Bridgewater Paper Works) - was the subject of a planning consultation, in which it may have been proposed that the docks be relocated closer to Eastham on the Cheshire West and Chester/Wirral boundary, and the area be redeveloped into a predominantly residential area consisting of up to 8,000 new homes. Plans for such development were expected to be submitted to the Local Authority during early 2009.

Hanneman composed both music and lyrics for every Slayer album until his death in 2013 at age 49. He had his own signature guitar, the ESP Jeff Hanneman Signature model. Biography =Early life= Hanneman was born January 31, 1964 in Oakland, California, and grew up in Long Beach, California in a family containing several war veterans: his father fought in Normandy during World War II and his brothers in Vietnam, making warfare a common conversation topic at the dinner table. War films were popular on TV at the time, and Hanneman often joined his brothers in constructing and coloring tank and plane models. His interest in warfare and military history has been attributed to his upbringing. In a 2009 interview with Decibel magazine, he stated his father is German, but fought for the Allied side in World War II. In the same interview, he also goes into detail of what district of Germany his father and grandparents hail from. His grandfather was fluent in German. Hanneman was introduced to heavy metal music as a child through his older sister Mary, when she was listening to Black Sabbath at her house.D.X. Ferris, Slayer's Reign in Blood, Continuum, 2008, p.33 Once he reached high school, he discovered hardcore punk, which had a significant influence on his style and attitude. =Slayer= Hanneman performing live with Slayer at the Fields of Rock (2007) In 1981, Hanneman, who was working as a telemarketer at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called \\"Ledger\\". King remembered: \\"As I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that I was into, like Def Leppard's 'Wasted' and AC/DC and Priest\\". After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked \\"Why don't we start our own band?\\", to which Hanneman replied \\"...Fuck yeah!\\". Hanneman stated that he was playing guitar for a year by the time he met King and put an effort into improving his skills after watching him play.Joel McIver, The Bloody Reign of Slayer, Omnibus Press, 2009 Hanneman, who was heavily influenced by hardcore punk music, got the other members into the genre, leading Slayer into a faster and more aggressive approach. The band's drummer Dave Lombardo asserted that his hardcore influences pushed him to play faster, contributing to shape his drumming style. In 1984, Hanneman, Lombardo and Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Rocky George had a brief hardcore punk side project called \\"Pap Smear\\" ‚Äì the band had many tracks and was due to start recording when Hanneman was advised to avoid the side project by Slayer's producer, Rick Rubin, who is quoted as saying \\"Aaaah, don't do it, man ‚Äì this is the kind of thing that breaks bands up!\\" and Hanneman took Rubin's advice. Only a demo was recorded, consisting of Hanneman on vocals and bass, Lombardo on drums and George on guitar. Later two of the songs were re-recorded on Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude. =Illness and death= In early 2011, Hanneman contracted necrotizing fasciitis. Reports linked this illness with a spider bite he claimed to have received while in a friend's hot tub. In light of his illness and Slayer's upcoming participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour that was set to begin on February 26, 2011, the band made the decision to play the dates without Hanneman, and on February 16, 2011, brought on Gary Holt (Exodus) to fill in for him. Pat O'Brien (Cannibal Corpse) joined as Slayer's temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with Exodus. In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced a recovery from the disease. However, in February 2013, King revealed that Hanneman was still battling health issues that prevented him from performing. Hanneman died of liver failure on May 2, 2013, in a Southern California hospital near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death. Holt became Slayer's new full-time guitarist after Hanneman died. Personal life In 1989, Hanneman married Kathryn in Las Vegas. They had met in 1983 before the release of the debut album Show No Mercy, during a Slayer show in Buena Park, California. Hanneman was a reserved person when he was offstage. Unlike the other members, he was very selective in socializing and rarely gave interviews. As vocalist/bassist Araya said: \\"If he didn't like you, he wouldn't hang with you.\\" German history The Knight's Cross Hanneman's interest in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated by many of his lyrics. Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals given to him by his father, including some taken from a dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1,000. While touring with Mot√∂rhead, Hanneman discovered Mot√∂rhead vocalist Lemmy's interest in medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht. Hanneman's lyrics for the song \\"Angel of Death\\" led to accusations of Slayer being Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman defended himself with \\"I know why people misinterpret it -- it‚Äôs because they get this knee-jerk reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there‚Äôs nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he (Josef Mengele) was a bad man, because to me ‚Äì well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that.\\" The band has stated numerous times that they are not Nazis and do not condone Nazism. Influences and style Hanneman's major influences included hard rock and heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, AerosmithD.X. Ferris, Slayer's Reign in Blood, Continuum, 2008, p.34 and hardcore punk acts such as Wasted Youth, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, T.S.O.L., which led to Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude. Hanneman's and King's dual guitar solos have been called \\"wildly chaotic,\\" and \\"twisted genius\\". South of Heaven featured \\"more technical\\" guitar riffs, utilizing the aforementioned tremolo picking and down-picked notes, improving musicianship while retaining a melodic sense. Both Hanneman and King were ranked #10 in Guitar World's \\"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.\\" Legacy Hanneman's guitar work had a notable influence on heavy metal music and culture. Musicians such as Robb Flynn (Machine Head), Dino Cazares (Fear Factory, Divine Heresy), Mille Petrozza (Kreator), Andreas Kisser (Sepultura), Dan Lilker (Anthrax, Nuclear Assault), Eric Hoffman (Amon/Deicide), Trevor Peres (Obituary), Mark Morton (Lamb of God) and Kelly Shaefer (Atheist) cited him as an influence on their playing and songwriting. Jeff Walker said that \\"Hanneman's playing and riff writing and attitude has had a big impact on Carcass\\". Shavo Odadjian declared that \\"without Jeff Hanneman, there would be no System of a Down\\". John Consterdine of Terrorizer magazine noted: \\"without Jeff Hanneman, Slayer certainly would not have created some of the most famous riffs in metal, which undoubtedly changed the entire genre\\". According to Jeff Kitts of Guitar World, he \\"influenced a generation and changed the course of metal forever\\". Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse, who considers Hanneman his major influence as a composer, regarded him as \\"one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in metal\\" and Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom described him as \\"one of the fathers of metal\\". Alex Skolnick of Testament asserted that he \\"wrote some of the best riffs of all time\\" and \\"he impacted music in such a way that an entire genre will never be the same\\". According to Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Hanneman is \\"one of the most underrated writers and underrated players that ever was\\" while Slash of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver defined him \\"the king of thrash/speed metal guitar\\". Lyrics and music Hanneman wrote the music for most of the band's fan favorites, songs such as \\"Angel of Death\\", \\"Raining Blood\\", \\"Die by the Sword\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", \\"War Ensemble\\", \\"Postmortem\\", \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" and \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", which have all become staples for live performance at Slayer shows. Hanneman's favorite album was Reign in Blood, and he enjoyed performing the songs \\"Raining Blood\\" and \\"Angel of Death.\\" He contributed lyrics and music to every Slayer album, having formed a music and lyric writing partnership with Araya, which sometimes overshadowed King's creative input. When writing new material, the band writes the music before the lyrics. Hanneman often composed riffs at his house, using a 24-track and a drum machine and then by gathering opinions from the other band members; King and Lombardo made suggestions of alterations. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and then figure out where the lyrics and solos go. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music is a \\"free for all\\"; \\"It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry ‚Äì it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good we use it, if not we don't.\\" Equipment Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul modified with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge pickup in Slayer's early days and through the Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits eras. There are also photos and videos of him playing a natural stain-finished Gibson Explorer during the band's early days. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his bandmate Kerry King and subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and two DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. He and King can both also be seen with a second set of B.C. Rich's around 1986‚Äì1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel ‚Äì Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica ‚Äì Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.

The Capelinhos Volcano, the westernmost point of the island, might as well be the westernmost point of Europe, if the Monchique Islet, near Flores Island, is considered part of North America, for it sits on the North American Plate. Its largest town is Horta. With its nearest neighbours, Pico (east across the channel) and S√£o Jorge (northeast across the channel), it forms an area commonly known as the Tri√¢ngulo (English: Triangle). The island has also been referred to as the Ilha Azul (English: Blue Island), derived from the writings of Portuguese poet Raul Brand√£o, due to the large quantity of hydrangeas that bloom during the summer months:  History  During a period of medieval legends and unsubstantiated stories of mystical lands,Many stories have been told in the history of Portuguese discovery related to the Azores of the land of Atlantis, Sete Cidades, lands of S√£o Brand√£o, the Ilhas Afortundadas, Ilha do Brasil, Ant√≠lia, Ilhas Azuis, Terras do Bacalhaus, and the mysterious island of equestrian statue (attributed to the island of Corvo). the island of Faial first appeared on the 1375‚Äì1377 Atlas Catal√£o, as Ilha da Ventura or Insula de La Ventura (English: Venture Island). By 1427 they had discovered what most had suspected: islands in the middle of the Atlantic (specifically the islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel). In subsequent years there would occur new discoveries until, during his first voyage of exploration (in 1451), the navigator Diogo de Teive explored the coast of Faial. It was the humanist friar Gaspar Frutuoso who recounted that the first explorers did not find an uninhabited island: a hermit, who had a small flock and lived in a cave in the interior, had occupied the land.Later, during the settlement phase, colonists from Terceira were known to deposit their herds on the island, returning in the summer while checking their holdings, and regularly communicated with this hermit. He disappeared into history, as legend goes, when he crossed the canal between Faial and Pico (Saudades da Terra, Vol.VI, Cap.37) By 1460, the nautical charts would refer to this island as Ilha de S√£o Luis. It was at about this time that Valentim Fernandes da Mor√°via, a German intellectual and translator residing in Lisbon, recounted the first story related to the settlement of the island. As he wrote, Frair Pedro, the queen's confessor, traveled with the Infanta D. Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy, to Flanders, where he met and developed a friendship with the nobleman Josse van Huerter. During their conversations D. Pedro talked to van Huerter of the islands and that there existed deposits of silver and tin (which he assumed were the Ilhas Cassit√©rides, or in English, the Islands of Tin). Van Huerter convinced 15 other men of the profitability of a venture in the archipelago. Around 1465, Huerter disembarked for the first time on Faial along the beach of Praia de Almofariz (now Praia de Almoxarife). The expedition remained in the area of Lomba dos Frades for about a year, until their supplies ran out. His compatriots were angered by the lack of the promised precious metals, and quickly van Huerter escaped to Flanders and the court of the Duchess of Burgundy. In 1467, Huerter returned to Faial on a new expedition, supported by the Duchess, who \\"ordered men and women of all conditions, as well as priests to convey their religious orders, in addition to ships loaded with furniture and utensils necessary for the land and construction of houses, and she sent them for two years, everything they cared for subsistence\\" (as quoted by German geographer, Martin Behaim in his text Globo de Nuremberga). He also noted that Isabella had ordered that civil criminals should be sent to the island. Infante D. Fernando (Duke of Viseu and Master of the Order of Christ) gave Van Heutere the title of Captain-Major The title is a feudal title used in the Atlantic colonies and Brasil where a governor is not warranted, and where the administration of lands, the provision of courts and system of finances require a political administration. The Captains-major were generally remunerated from 10% of the land rents, as well as having their selection of lands within their administration. of the island. Immediately, the new colonists had problems in their new colony, due to a lack of potable water. They moved their settlement to the adjacent valley (which continues to bear the name of Flamengos, the Portuguese term for Flemish or literally, Flemish people). Van Huerter constructed a small chapel, consecrated in the name of Santa Cruz (Holy Cross). He eventually returned temporarily to Lisbon, where he married D. Beatriz de Macedo, governess of the Duke of Viseu. Still an apt negotiator, he returned to Faial promoting the settlement of the colony and his holdings. He convinced a second group of settlers, under the Flemish nobleman Willem van der Haegen (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) to bring his compatriots, their families and support staff to the island in 1467. The settlers concentrated in the area of Concei√ß√£o and Porto Pim, creating the nuclei of the Vila de Orta (later the Vila de Horta), a name transliterated from the surname of Josse van Huerter. By 1490, this Flemish community numbered approximately 1500 people, and were joined by several families from the Alentejo, Moinho and other islands in the archipelago. The rapid growth of the island, in this phase, was the result of the cultivation of wheat, and the growth in the woad industry. It was some time later, when the island's name changed to \\"Fayal\\", due to the large number of Faya trees Myrica faya. With the island's improving economy more Portuguese settled and rapidly the Flemish influence diminished. In 1583, as part of the Spanish occupation of the Azores (which began with a landing party on Terceira), a Spanish fleet was sent to Faial. During the expeditionary assault, a body of armed men landed at Pasteleiro and engaged the defenders. Although reinforced by French troops, the garrison was unable to fend off the invaders. During the Iberian Union of Portugal and Spain, the island was frequently attacked by British and French pirates. Raiding parties from the Earl of Cumberland (George Clifford) and Earl of Essex (Robert Devereaux) attacked the defenseless populations between 1589 and 1597. This was partly due to the influx of Spanish to the islands, as opportunities for Iberian businessmen improved. Unfortunately, the privateers robbed the inhabitants and burned what they left behind, non differentiating between Portuguese and Spanish. To protect themselves, the Faialense built a large number of fortresses; in the 18th century there were more than 20. Meantime offshore from Faial, on 22/23 June 1594, in what became known as The Battle of Faial Island or the Action of Faial, three ships of the Earl of Cumberland attacked the 2,000 ton Portuguese carrack Las Cinque Chagas, which historians believe to be the richest treasure ship ever to sail from the East Indies, firing and sinking the ship immediately off the island with all hands and all cargo lost.Bernardo Gomes de Brito: \\"Historia Tragico Maritima\\", (1735, pp. 517 et seq) The Cabe√ßo di Fogo Volcano erupted in 1672, leading to substantial emigration to Brazil, In intervening years Horta became a stopover for Jesuit missionaries traveling to and from Brasil and Asia. The Jesuits constructed a college in Horta, as did the Carmelites and Franciscan Orders. The explorer James Cook also reached the islands before initiating his Pacific voyages of discovery, during the 18th century. During the War of 1812, British ships Plantagenet, Rota, and Carnation attacked the American privateer on 26 September 1814 in the Fayal harbourhttp://bobrowen.com/nymas/warof1812paper/paperrevised2006.html The people of Faial were active participants in the struggles between the Liberals and Absolutionists, finally deciding to favor the Liberals, welcoming the visit of King Pedro IV in 1832. For its loyalty, Horta was elevated to status of town. bark Azor, the most popular of all the Fayal ships. In 1876 work started on the construction of a dock in the protected harbor of Horta. As time progressed, Faial's importance expanded through this dock, as a way-point to trans-Atlantic traffic. Charles William Dabney, the American entrepreneur (1794-1871), was responsible for the growth of the industry of the islands with whaling, wine and orange exports predominating. A philanthropic figure, Dabney was responsible for cultivating the economy of the island and supporting its population, aid to agriculture and generating markets abroad for their goods. Aside owning the Fayal shipping line, he was a US consul in the Azores 1826-1871; one of the three Dabneys who for many years held the post of American consul in the Azores. The growth of industry and trans- Atlantic sail traffic also expanded Horta's importance, as a safe harbor and coal storage base. In 1919, the first airplane to cross the Atlantic stopped at Horta. Horta's exceptional situation also led to Pan American establishing a Clipper base there. Similarly, British, American, French, German and Italian intercontinental submarine cable stations were based in Horta. During World War Two, Horta was also an important naval base, giving shelter to some Allied ships that took part in the Normandy invasion. The island, dependent on whaling and agriculture, remained prosperous until the eruption of Capelinhos volcano in 1957. Communities of the northern and western coast were harshly affected by the volcano's eruption, as agricultural lands were untillable and covered with sand and ash. This led to the immigration of 4000 people to the United States, spearheaded by members of the Portuguese diaspora in New England and the influential Massachusetts Senator (John F. Kennedy). In addition, whaling, as a viable commercial enterprise was slowly curtailed with innovations in the chemical sector and animal-rights influence. Economic and political changes since the 1980s have helped to revitalize the islands economy and development. After the Azores gained the status of an Autonomous Region within Portugal, Horta, the island's only city, was allowed to host the Regional Parliament (Parlamento Regional) of the Azores.  Geography  = Physical geography = Along with other islands in the Azores archipelago, Faial is of volcanic origin and is close to the tectonic divide between the European and North American Plates. Indeed, the island can be considered (from a geophysical perspective) the westernmost point of Europe (the two islands west of Faial, Flores and Corvo, are already on the American plate). Visually, the island is characterized as an irregular pentagon, that occupies an area of approximately , and formed along a leaky transform fault extending from the mid-Atlantic Ridge to Hirondella faults. This is the same fault that bisects the remainder of the Central Group of islands along a west-northwest to east- southeast orientation. Although formed by complex volcanological events, the current landmass is dominated by the crater of its central stratovolcano with relatively gently sloping flanks, showing little signs of major erosion. The view of the central Caldera () as seen from the southern rim of Cabe√ßo Gordo The island was formed from several geomorphological structures resulting from volcanism and other tectonic forces: * The nature of the stratovolcano structure results in an island that converges at the central Caldera Volcanic Complex, although the highest point occurs along the southern rim, at the peak of Cabe√ßo Gordo (1,043 m above sea level). The Caldeira (Caldera) is almost circular, 2000 m perimeter, with a 400 m depth below the summit of Cabe√ßo Gordo (almost 570 m above sea level). Its center is broken by water marshes, thickets, and minor cinder cones, and surrounded by almost vertical cliffs with a diverse vegetation, both endemic or invasive to Macaronesia. It is constituted by pyroclastic material, pumitic projectiles, phreatic and phreatomagmatic deposits and examples of pyroclastic flows and lahars. * The Pedro Miguel Graben, located in the island's northeast, is characterized by an extensive fault system, showing the remnants of the original Ribeirinha Central Volcano that formed the island. * In the southeast, the Horta Platform is characterized by low altitude projectiles and extensive lava flows. Several strombolian and the surtseyan cones, such as Monte da Guia, cover the area occupied by the island's main urban center. * The Capelo Volcanic Complex is the most recent geomorphological feature, composed of a linear series of scoria cones, resulting from basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The last eruption occurred along Costa da Nau and Ponta dos Caplinhos, near the small parish of Capelo on September 27, 1957. At first, a small \\"Ilha Nova\\" (new island) formed off the coast, quickly disappearing. During a subsequent eruption a cone and a small isthmus formed off the coast and then volcanic activity dissipated. The volcano became active again on December 16, 1957; this lasted until May 12, 1958 and connected the islet with Faial, effectively enlarging the island by 2.4 km¬≤ and extending the \\"Ponta dos Capelinhos\\" into the western ocean. The mineral fayalite is named for this island, having been first identified and described here in 1840. It is an iron-rich expression within the olivine family. =Ecoregions/Protected areas= Capelinhos Volcano and Ponta dos Capelinhos (including Lighthouse) North coast as seen from Cabe√ßo Verde The Cabe√ßo dos Trinto in the Central Zone of the island of Pico In 2008, the Regional Government of the Azores established a comprehensive administrative framework to administer and promote the various environmental ecosystems of the island. These areas were reorganized under Regional Legislative Decree 46/2008/A, into the Faial Nature Park, that includes 13 protected areas: ;Nature Reserves * [FAI01] Nature Reserve of the Caldeirinhas () * [FAI02] Nature Reserve of the Caldeira () * [FAI03] Nature Reserve of the Morro do Castelo Branco () ;Protected Areas for the Management of Habitats and Coast Species * [FAI04] Protected Area of Cabe√ßo do Fogo () * [FAI05] Protected Area of Capelinhos, Northwest Coast and Varadouro () * [FAI06] Protected Area of Varadouro-Castelo Branco () * [FAI07] Protected Area of Lomba Grande () ;Protected Landscapes * [FAI08] Protected Landscape of Monte da Guia () * [FAI09] Protected Landscape of the Central Zone () ;Protected Areas for the Management of Resources * [FAI10] Protected Resource Area of the (Faial Sector) Faial-Pico Channel () * [FAI11] Protected Resource Area of Castelo Branco () * [FAI12] Protected Resource Area of Capelinhos () * [FAI13] Protected Resource Area of Cedros () In addition, there are a few instituted forest reserves on the island of Faial, under the authority of the Direc√ß√£o Regional de Recursos Florestais (Regional Directorate for Forest Services): * Forest Reserve of Capelo () * Forest Reserve of Cabouco Velho () * Recreational Forest Reserve of Falca () Other areas of geological or environmental interest: * Anelares Grotto (), located along the southern road of the Ribeira da Lombega, in Castelo Branco, this is a geological formation produced from a lava tube near the mountainous coast: it extends 35.5 meters from Ribeira da Lombega, is 2.5 meters wide and is 3.7 meters at its highest point. In 2013, the submarine Lula1000, while diving in the Faial-Pico canal discovered a coral reef situated in depth and covering an area of . In a communiqu√© to the Rebikoff‚ÄìNiggeler Foundation, the group suggested that the reef formation was an important first discovery for the submarine team, which was located in the waters of the Azores since 1994, in order to document sea depth. Until this time, there were no documented records of coral reefs at such a depth in the waters of the Azores, nor at such a distance from Faial. = Human geography = Administratively, the island is governed as one municipality, with its government seat in the city of Horta. Operationally, there are thirteen civil parishes with their own assemblies, three of which (Ang√∫stias, Matriz and Concei√ß√£o) constitute the principal urbanized core: * Ang√∫stias; urban parish that includes the escoria cones of Monte da Guia, Monte Escuro and Monte Carneiro, as well as the island's hospital, the major hotels, commercial and container port, and many historical buildings (such as the Fort of Santa Cruz, The Cedars, and the Church of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias): 3,025 inhabitants (2003). * Concei√ß√£o; urbanized and rural parish connected to the city of Horta, with 1,157 inhabitants in 2001. It was one of the nuclei of the modern city of Horta, location of the historic forts of Alagoa and Bom Jesus, and location of the Courts building and Fayal Sport Club (and football field). * Matriz; the urban heart of the city of Horta, with 2,523 inhabitants (2001); landmarks include the Horta Museum, Sociedade Recreativa Amor da P√°tria, Imp√©rio dos Nobres, the historic Clock Tower, the former Walter Bensa√∫de Hospital and the Horta Archive and the Public Library, as well as the location of the Municipal Government (C√¢mara Municipal da Horta). The urbanized city of Horta, seen from Monte da Guia (looking towards Cabe√ßo Gordo stratovolcano), showing principally the civil parish of Ang√∫stias The remainder of the parishes (except Flamengos) circle the island, all linked by the regional road network and its ancillary roads: * Flamengos; one of the first nuclei of settlement and colonization, and the only interior/landlocked parish in the municipality of Horta founded by Flemish colonists and Portuguese settlers from the archipelago. * Praia do Almoxarife; the beachhead of the early colonists to Faial, Almoxarife is a coastal parish on the east coast, located between Ponta da Espalamaca and Lomba dos Frades, and is known for its black sand beach. * Pedro Miguel; located on the eastern coast between Lomba dos Frades and Lomba Grande, its 723 inhabitants lost its primary place of worship (the Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda)during the 1998 earthquake. * Ribeirinha; nestled in the river valley of the Pedro Miguel Graben and existing along the fracture zone of the Ribeirinha Volcanic complex alon the north-northeast coast, Riberinha has experienced many seismic events historically. * Sal√£o; the smallest parish by population situated on the northern coast of Faial, a community built by Spanish settlers, that were later expelled following the end of the Iberian Union. * Cedros; built on the coastal cliffs of the Cedros Plateau along the northern coast, it is the oldest parish on Faial, involved in agriculture and dairy industry (and the location of the milk cooperative C.A.L.F). * Praia do Norte; a zone of recent historical volcanism, built on layers of ash and pyroclastic deposits, the parish became \\"extinct\\" between 1672 and 1845, following the eruption of Cabe√ßo do Fogo, which depopulated the parish. Emigration also occurred following the eruption of Capelinhos in 1957/58. * Capelo; a parish built along a linear series of volcanic cones, culminating in the 1957/58 eruption of Capelinhos off the western coast. The crisis caused the implementation of an immigration program spearheaded by Senator John F. Kennedy, that reduced the population of Faial and Capelo. * Castelo Branco; location of the international airport, its 1115 inhabitants are involved in a mix of agricultural and enterprises associated with primary and secondary industries along the southern coast that includes the micro-climate of Varadouro. * Feteira; a parish dominated by agriculture, the inhabitants are equally tied to the commercial activities in Horta, developing into a suburb of the larger city. Faial has been affected by various earthquakes and seismic events during its populated history. The most important was the 1759‚Äì1760 earthquakes and aftershocks that occurred around Christmas and New Years. Similar in nature, the 1926 earthquake which rumbled the city of Horta, in early-April, where damages were reported in Flamengos, Ribeirinha and Concei√ß√£o. Then, on August 31 at 8:42, a new earthquakes caused eight deaths and ruined buildings in Horta, as well as the parishes of Concei√ß√£o, Praia do Almoxarife (ruining 220 homes), Flamengos, Feteira and Castelo Branco, Salao and most of the Lomba do Pilar. Approximately 4,138 homes and buildings were partially or totally damaged. Similar tremors and events were felt in 1957‚Äì1958 (Capelinhos eruption), then in 1963, and again in 1973. The 1998 Azores earthquake on July 9, which shook the islands of Faial, Pico and S√£o Jorge at 07:19 (its epicentre north-northeast of Faial) measured 5.6 on the Richter scale and caused damages to the parishes of Riberinha, Pedro Miguel, Sal√£o and Cedros and stronger damages in Castelo Branco (mainly Lombega), Flamengos and Praia do Almoxarife. Eight people lost their lives in the earthquake and 1,700 were left homeless.  Economy  Faial's early economic growth was propelled by cultivation and processing of woad, a blue-coloured dye produced from a plant of the same name (in Latin, Isatis tinctoria). It was the only source for blue dye until the end of the 16th century when Portuguese trade routes started bringing indigo from the far east. Economic and population growth was also spearheaded by many legends of tin and silver, perpetuated by members of the Portuguese court. The economy of the island generated some prosperity until 1957, when the Capelinhos Volcano erupted in the western part of the island, reactivating emigration to North America, supported by promises of aid made by Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy to the affected populations. The main agricultural resources of the island are potatoes, cereals, fruits, and wines, along with cattle (which makes up its dairy and meat industry). The city of Horta is the centre of commerce and services of the island. In the 1970s, after the ‚ÄúRevolution of the Carnations,‚Äù Portugal experienced economic growth, and an airport was opened; with it, tourists came. After Portugal's entry into the EEC, the standard of living rapidly grew and today the population generally prospers. Architecture Faial is a tourist's island with a rich collection of historical, natural and modern attractions that annually attract yachts, cruise ships, tourist groups and the naturalists to the hills and streets of the island. Apart from several hotels and bed & breakfasts scattered throughout the parishes, the visitor seeking sun will likely travel to the black sand beaches of Praia de Almoxarife, Concei√ß√£o and Porto Pim, as well as the rock pools scattered along the coast. Varadouro is one such place, known for its warmer waters, micro-climate, summer cottages and complicated salt-water pools open to the ocean. =Civic= * Termas do Varadouro (Thermal Spa of Varadouro) * Geological Museum of the Volcano * Interpretative Center of the Capelinhos Volcano (including the Capelinhos lighthouse) * Escola de Artesanto do Capelo (School of Handicrafts) =Military= * Fort of Santa Cruz * World War Two Artillery Batteries =Religious= * Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Esperan√ßa ‚Äì ruined chapel on the grounds of the parochial church, Capelo * Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo ‚Äì located in Varadouro, Capelo * Chapel of S√£o Pedro ‚Äì abandoned chapel to St. Peter, located in Feteira * Church of Santa Catarina de Alexandria ‚Äì situated in Castelo Branco * Church of Santissima Trinidade (Holy Trinity) ‚Äì located in Capelo * Church of the Divino Esp√≠rito Santo ‚Äì one of the oldest churches on the island, located in Feteira * Church of Nossa Senhora das Dores - Praia do Norte Culture =Festivities= There are several secular and religious festivals that make-up the calendar of events on Faial. The most important ones occur in the summer. From Ascension Day until August, the feasts of the Holy Spirit are major events in each parish and neighborhood. During these events, a procession goes to the local church, a mass is celebrated there in conformity with a tradition/legend of Saint Elizabeth of Portugal, and then the procession returns to the local imp√©rio, where a feast of meat broth and soup is served to the invited guests, and the same soup and massa sovada (sweet bread) is handed out, as a traditional sign of penitence. On Faial, generally, these feasts are by invitation, whereas on other islands public events occur. The patron saint of Faial is Saint John, celebrated as S√£o Jo√£o da Caldeira on June 24. This is a day celebrated with a mass at the Chapel of S√£o Jo√£o, followed by family picnics along the roadways and fields of the Caldera. Similarly, in Largo Jaime Melo in Horta, people gather from around the island to enjoy picnics, and other diversions (such as band music and/or singers). On August 1, people celebrate the annual feast of Nossa Senhora da Guia, a celebration originally started by local fisherman in the name of the Virgin Mary. A flotilla of small boats with one carrying the statue of the Virgin arrives in the harbor at Port Pim. From there, following benedictions, the statue is taken in procession to the top of Monte da Guia, where mass is celebrated in the chapel of Monte da Guia. The most important festival of the Faialense calendar is the secular Semana do Mar (Sea Week). It is a week-long celebration in Horta of Faial's link to the sea, celebrated in song, dance, exhibitions and kiosks selling different foods (of local and continental Portugal) and goods. During the day there are several sailing competitions and exhibits, while in the evening while many sample foods along the Avenida Marginal, others listen and/or dance to popular and/or traditional musical acts on one of several platforms devoted to band, traditional and modern/contemporary musical artists. The events culminate with a traditional closing ceremony and fireworks display. =Tradition= The island, like some other Azorean islands, produces cheeses and other milk products, along with cow meat, and by-products notable in Portugal, and it has a rich cuisine that also includes local seafood. Scrimshaw, handiwork made of whale teeth, is a traditional craft of the Azores. However, because of the prohibition on whaling in Portugal, some designs of this can easily cost hundreds of euros, due to the rarity of whale teeth.

It is important in theory because it establishes that NFAs, despite their additional flexibility, are unable to recognize any language that cannot be recognized by some DFA. It is also important in practice for converting easier-to-construct NFAs into more efficiently executable DFAs. However, if the NFA has n states, the resulting DFA may have up to 2n states, an exponentially larger number, which sometimes makes the construction impractical for large NFAs. The construction, sometimes called the Rabin‚ÄìScott powerset construction (or subset construction) to distinguish it from similar constructions for other types of automata, was first published by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott in 1959. Intuition To simulate the operation of a DFA on a given input string, one needs to keep track of a single state at any time: the state that the automaton will reach after seeing a prefix of the input. In contrast, to simulate an NFA, one needs to keep track of a set of states: all of the states that the automaton could reach after seeing the same prefix of the input, according to the nondeterministic choices made by the automaton. If, after a certain prefix of the input, a set of states can be reached, then after the next input symbol the set of reachable states is a deterministic function of and . Therefore, the sets of reachable NFA states play the same role in the NFA simulation as single DFA states play in the DFA simulation, and in fact the sets of NFA states appearing in this simulation may be re-interpreted as being states of a DFA. Construction The powerset construction applies most directly to an NFA that does not allow state transformations without consuming input symbols (aka: \\"Œµ-moves\\"). Such an automaton may be defined as a 5-tuple , in which is the set of states, is the set of input symbols, is the transition function (mapping a state and an input symbol to a set of states), is the initial state, and is the set of accepting states. The corresponding DFA has states corresponding to subsets of . The initial state of the DFA is , the (one- element) set of initial states. The transition function of the DFA maps a state (representing a subset of ) and an input symbol to the set , the set of all states that can be reached by an -transition from a state in . A state of the DFA is an accepting state if and only if at least one member of is an accepting state of the NFA. In the simplest version of the powerset construction, the set of all states of the DFA is the powerset of , the set of all possible subsets of . However, many states of the resulting DFA may be useless as they may be unreachable from the initial state. An alternative version of the construction creates only the states that are actually reachable. =NFA with Œµ-moves= For an NFA with Œµ-moves (also called an Œµ-NFA), the construction must be modified to deal with these by computing the Œµ-closure of states: the set of all states reachable from some given state using only Œµ-moves. Van Noord recognizes three possible ways of incorporating this closure computation in the powerset construction: # Compute the Œµ-closure of the entire automaton as a preprocessing step, producing an equivalent NFA without Œµ-moves, then apply the regular powerset construction. This version, also discussed by Hopcroft and Ullman,, pp. 26‚Äì27. is straightforward to implement, but impractical for automata with large numbers of Œµ-moves, as commonly arise in natural language processing application. # During the powerset computation, compute the Œµ-closure \\\\\\\\{q' ~~ q \\\\to^{*}_\\\\varepsilon q' \\\\\\\\} of each state that is considered by the algorithm (and cache the result). # During the powerset computation, compute the Œµ-closure \\\\\\\\{q' ~~ \\\\exists q \\\\in Q', q \\\\to^{*}_\\\\varepsilon q' \\\\\\\\} of each subset of states that is considered by the algorithm, and add its elements to . =Multiple initial states= If NFAs are defined to allow for multiple initial states,. the initial state of the corresponding DFA is the set of all initial states of the NFA, or (if the NFA also has Œµ-moves) the set of all states reachable from initial states by Œµ-moves. Example The NFA below has four states; state 1 is initial, and states 3 and 4 are accepting. Its alphabet consists of the two symbols 0 and 1, and it has Œµ-moves. upright=1.5 The initial state of the DFA constructed from this NFA is the set of all NFA states that are reachable from state 1 by Œµ-moves; that is, it is the set {1,2,3}. A transition from {1,2,3} by input symbol 0 must follow either the arrow from state 1 to state 2, or the arrow from state 3 to state 4. Additionally, neither state 2 nor state 4 have outgoing Œµ-moves. Therefore, ({1,2,3},0) = {2,4}, and by the same reasoning the full DFA constructed from the NFA is as shown below. upright=1.5 As can be seen in this example, there are five states reachable from the start state of the DFA; the remaining 11 sets in the powerset of the set of NFA states are not reachable. Complexity NFA with 5 states (left) whose DFA (right) requires 16 states. Because the DFA states consist of sets of NFA states, an -state NFA may be converted to a DFA with at most states. For every , there exist -state NFAs such that every subset of states is reachable from the initial subset, so that the converted DFA has exactly states, giving Œò() worst-case time complexity.. A simple example requiring nearly this many states is the language of strings over the alphabet {0,1} in which there are at least characters, the th from last of which is 1. It can be represented by an -state NFA, but it requires DFA states, one for each -character suffix of the input; cf. picture for . Applications Brzozowski's algorithm for DFA minimization uses the powerset construction, twice. It converts the input DFA into an NFA for the reverse language, by reversing all its arrows and exchanging the roles of initial and accepting states, converts the NFA back into a DFA using the powerset construction, and then repeats its process. Its worst-case complexity is exponential, unlike some other known DFA minimization algorithms, but in many examples it performs more quickly than its worst-case complexity would suggest. Safra's construction, which converts a non- deterministic B√ºchi automaton with states into a deterministic Muller automaton or into a deterministic Rabin automaton with 2O( log ) states, uses the powerset construction as part of its machinery..

On January 14, NBC greenlighted production on the pilot. Anthony and Joe Russo signed on as directors of the pilot on February 6. On May 17, 2004 NBC announced that they had picked up the pilot to series. This show was not renewed for a second season. Exterior shots for the pilot episode were filmed in Texas, although sources differ on whether Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport or Fort Worth Alliance Airport stood in for Los Angeles International. Many other scenes were filmed using a vacant terminal and a disused Boeing 727 at Ontario International Airport, interspersed with establishing shots of the real LAX airport. The theme song for the show was the beginning of \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" by Electric Light Orchestra. For the opening sequence of the final episode, a different excerpt of the song was used. Broadcast and syndication On February 22, 2014, it is announced reruns of LAX would air on Ion Television in fall 2014. Reception In a survey by Philips, LAX got 17% of the votes for most anticipated new series. The show was frequently the butt of comedic jokes due to its poor ratings, including Jay Leno, who remarked the show was \\"so bad that the actual Los Angeles Airport is thinking of changing its name to avoid being associated with the show.\\" The 13 episodes of the program averaged 6.52 million viewers. LAX lost 19.09% of the viewers in its time slot versus the previous season, which was occupied by Third Watch.

It is located at the border of Linn and Deschutes counties, approximately northwest of Bend, between the Three Sisters to the south and Mount Washington to the north. Oregon Route 242 goes over the pass. At the summit of the pass, Oregon Route 242 crosses a lava flow just west of Sisters. Surrounded by lava, the Dee Wright Observatory was constructed in 1935 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers and named after their foreman. Visitors climb to the observatory to view the Cascade peaks visible from McKenzie Pass. Also near the summit is Clear Lake, a renowned location for fresh-water diving. Highway 242 is not recommended for large trucks, trailers or motor homes due to numerous tight switchbacks. The pass is closed from November to July due to snow. The pass is named for Donald McKenzie, a Scottish Canadian fur trader who explored parts of the Pacific Northwest for the Pacific Fur Company in the early 19th century. Astronaut training Parts of central Oregon were used as a training grounds for Apollo astronauts between 1964 and 1966. The astronauts would practice walking on terrain that was similar to the surface of the moon. In August 1964, Walter Cunningham struggled in a lava flow at McKenzie Pass, where he eventually fell and tore his space suit. Cunningham piloted the lunar module on Apollo 7 in 1968.

It is located on the border between Linn and Jefferson counties, about northwest of Sisters, between the prominent volcanic horns of Three Fingered Jack to the north and Mount Washington to the south. Several other smaller volcanoes, including cinder cones and tuyas, are found near the summit of the pass. U.S. Route 20 connects eastern Oregon with the valley of the Santiam River on the west via Santiam Pass. One of the 19 or 20 lakes by the name of Lost Lake is located beside the highway just west of Santiam Pass. The pass may be approached from the west by three distinct routes: * Oregon Route 22, also known as the North Santiam Highway, proceeds southeast from Salem and follows the North Santiam River to Santiam Junction. * U.S. Route 20, which follows the South Santiam River from the Albany‚ÄìCorvallis area to Santiam Junction. * Oregon Route 126, which follows the McKenzie River northeast from Eugene. From the east, Santiam Pass is approached from the town of Sisters; however, immediately east of Sisters, U. S. Highway 20 and Oregon Route 126, which share the route over the pass, split with Oregon Route 126 going northeast to Redmond and Prineville, Oregon and U. S. Route 20 heading southeast to Bend. History While the pass was known by native peoples, the first recorded crossing of the pass was in April 1859 by an expedition searching for a cattle trail over the Cascade Range from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon. This expedition was led by Andrew Wiley, who reportedly climbed a tall tree on a mountain near Lost Prairie to help determine the route. Lost Prairie is located along Hackleman Creek between Fish Lake and Tombstone Prairie. Wiley later helped establish the Santiam Wagon Road. Originally known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who designated this crossing for his proposed railroad, Santiam Pass was renamed in 1929 when the Santiam Highway was completed. The original Santiam Pass is located three miles south and was discovered in 1859. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

The mountain/volcano is 1,043 meters above sea level, consisting of a two kilometer wide caldera, that is 400 m in depth below the crater rim. From Cabe√ßo Gordo, on a clear day, the islands of the central group of the Azores are visible: Pico, Sao Jorge, and Graciosa, although normally the caldera may be covered in clouds and fog. History Along the western edge of the Ribeirinha Volcano, the Central Volcanic Complex formed about 410,000 years ago,Serralheiro et al, 1989 along with several structures that arose from tectonics. Evidence of this process has not been preserved due to subsistence, but it is generally believedPacheco, 2001 that two formations (an Upper and Lower group) reflecting a geochemical variation that occurred about 16,000 years ago. The Lower group (from 410,000 years ago), was marked by the predominance of a Hawaiian/Strombolian eruptive process, that was composed of basaltic and benmoreitic rocks. The secondary, Upper group, was a highly explosive period (sub-Plinian in character), which produced a series of twelve deposits of pumice and surge deposits (pyroclastic flows of trachytic and benmoreitic). Although the central volcano has not been active within the past two centuries, it has seen activity related to the eruption of Capelinhos (1957‚Äì58). During this period, fumaroles in the caldera became active, and the minor lakes/swamps were dried-up by excessive heat. Cabe√ßo Gordo, due to its central nature, is part of each parish on the island (except for Matriz, Concei√ß√£o and Angustias). Geography Close-up of the caldera base, showing the junct fields, peat bogs and swamps Cabe√ßo Gordo is the main geomorphological unit, corresponding to a polygenetic volcano two kilometers at the top and one kilometer at the base. The walls of the crater rim are abrupt, although their slopes increase with altitudes. The superficial cover of the volcano is covered in pyroclastic material, such as pumice rock, phreatic and phreatomagmatic deposits, evidence of pyroclastic flows and lahars. The flanks of the stratovolcano also include the Morro de Castelo Branco and peninsula of denser material that have resisted erosion.

In 2004, he was convicted of the first-degree murder of his pregnant wife, Laci Peterson, and the second-degree murder of their unborn son, Conner, in Modesto, California, and in 2005, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. His case was on automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of California. On August 24, 2020, the death penalty for Peterson was overturned, though his conviction was upheld. Early life and marriage Scott Lee Peterson was born October 24, 1972, at Sharp Coronado Hospital in San Diego, California, to Lee Arthur Peterson, a businessman who owned a crate-packaging company, and Jacqueline \\"Jackie\\" Helen Latham,St. John, Kelly (March 7, 2004). \\"A PORTRAIT OF THE ACCUSED: In a rare interview, the family of Scott Peterson sheds light on the life and times of the 'perfect' son\\" .

Though Lee and Jackie had six children from previous relationships, Scott was their only child together. As a child, he shared a bedroom with his half-brother John in the family's two-bedroom apartment in La Jolla. Peterson began playing golf at an early age, a result of time he spent with his father. By age 14, he could beat his father at the game. For a time, he had dreams of becoming a professional golfer like Phil Mickelson, his teammate at the University of San Diego High School. By the end of high school, he was one of the top junior golfers in San Diego. In 1990, Peterson enrolled at Arizona State University (where Mickelson had also enrolled) on a partial golf scholarship.Harris, Ashley (May 10, 2016). \\"9 Famous People Who Went to Arizona State University\\" . Phoenix New Times. Mickelson would go on to become a highly successful PGA golfer, and Lee Peterson later testified that the considerable competition that Mickelson presented to his son while they were at Arizona State discouraged Peterson. Randall Mell of the Broward County, Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that Chip Couch, the father of another Arizona State golfer, Chris Couch, told Mell that he got Peterson kicked off the golf team. Couch stated that Peterson had taken Chris out drinking and to meet girls, resulting in a hangover for Chris. As Chris was the No. 1 junior in the country, Chip did not want Peterson to threaten his son's future, and complained to the golf coach, who kicked Peterson off the team. Peterson transferred to Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, and later, California Polytechnic State University. He initially planned to major in international business, but changed his major to agricultural business. Professors who taught Peterson described him as a model student. His agribusiness professor Jim Ahern commented, \\"I wouldn't mind having a class full of Scott Petersons.\\" While at California Polytechnic, Peterson worked at a restaurant in Morro Bay called the Pacific Caf√©. One of his co-workers would receive visits from a neighbor named Laci Denise Rocha, who also attended Cal Poly as an ornamental horticulture major. When Peterson and his future wife first met at the restaurant in mid-1994, Laci made the first move, sending him her phone number. Immediately after meeting him, Laci told her mother that she had met the man that she would marry. Peterson later called Laci and they began dating, their first date being a deep-sea fishing trip on which Laci got seasick. As Peterson's relationship with Laci grew more serious, he put aside his dreams of professional golf in order to focus on a business career. The couple dated for two years and eventually moved in together. In 1997, after Laci graduated, they married at Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort in San Luis Obispo County's Avila Valley. While Peterson finished his senior year, Laci took a job in nearby Prunedale. Prosecutors have stated that around this time, Peterson engaged in the first of at least two extramarital affairs, though they did not reveal names or details of these relationships. Peterson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural business in June 1998. After their graduations, the Petersons opened a sports bar in San Luis Obispo called The Shack. Contrary to a Los Angeles Times story that reported that Peterson's parents loaned him money to open the establishment, his parents emphatically told the San Francisco Chronicle that they did not, believing it was a bad investment. When the couple had difficulty finding a technician to install a needed vent in the restaurant, Peterson took the necessary certification course in Los Angeles in order to install it himself. Business was initially slow, but eventually improved, especially on weekends. The Petersons sold The Shack in 2000 when they moved to Laci's hometown of Modesto to start a family. In October 2000, they purchased a three-bedroom, two-bath bungalow house for $177,000 on Covena Avenue in an upscale neighborhood near La Loma Park. Laci soon took a part-time job as a substitute teacher, and Peterson got a job with Tradecorp U.S.A., a newly founded subsidiary of a European fertilizer company.Walsh, Diana (August 3, 2004). \\"THE PETERSON TRIAL / Credit-card debt takes center stage / Couple appeared to be living beyond means, says auditor\\" . San Francisco Chronicle. According to Lee Peterson, the Spanish company was trying to establish a customer base in the United States, and hired Peterson as their West Coast representative. Working on salary plus commission, he sold irrigation systems, fertilizer, chemical nutrients, and related products to big farms and flower growers, primarily in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Peterson was earning a salary of $5,000 a month before taxes. Laci's loved ones, including her mother and younger sister, related that she worked enthusiastically at being the perfect housewife, enjoying cooking and entertaining, and that she and her family welcomed the news in 2002 that she was pregnant. In November 2002, when Laci was seven months pregnant, Peterson was introduced by a friend to a Fresno massage therapist named Amber Frey. In later public statements, Frey said Peterson told her he was single, and the two began a romantic relationship. The last time Peterson's parents saw Laci was during a three-day weekend they spent together in Carmel, California the week before Christmas. Disappearance of Laci Peterson On December 23, 2002 at 5:45pm, Peterson and Laci went to Salon, Salon‚Äîthe workplace of Laci's sister, Amy Rocha‚Äîfor a monthly scheduled haircut. As they spoke, Rocha said Peterson offered to pick up a fruit basket that she had ordered for her grandfather as the Christmas gift the next day because he would be playing golf at a course nearby. Prosecutors say Peterson also told other people he would play golf on the day of Christmas Eve.\\"Stepsister describes last sighting of Laci Peterson\\" . CNN. June 7, 2004.

After police arrived at the Peterson home that night, Laci's keys, wallet and sunglasses were found in her purse in a closet. The dining room table was meticulously set for a family dinner the following night. One detective found a phone book on a kitchen counter, opened to a full-page ad for a defense lawyer. Peterson was reported to be completely calm. Modesto police detectives Jon Buehler and Allen Brocchini, the lead investigators on the case, questioned Scott Peterson that evening. Although Scott initially said he had spent the day golfing, he later told the police that he had gone to fish for sturgeon at the Berkeley Marina. At 2:15 p.m., he left a message for Laci, stating, \\"Hey, Beautiful. It's 2:15. I'm leaving Berkeley.\\" Peterson stated that he went fishing about 90 miles from the couple's Modesto home. Detectives immediately launched a search, but were surprised by Scott Peterson's behavior. Buehler told ABC News in 2017, \\"I suspected Scott when I first met him. Didn't mean he did it, but I was a little bit thrown off by his calm, cool demeanor and his lack of questioning ... he wasn't, 'Will you call me back? Can I have one of your cards? What are you guys doing now?'\\" Modesto police did not immediately reveal to the public that Peterson was a suspect, largely because Laci's family and friends maintained their faith in his innocence during the month following her disappearance. The police did treat the case as suspicious within the first few hours after the missing persons report was filed. Eventually, the police grew more suspicious of Peterson due to inconsistencies in his story. On January 17, 2003, it became known that Peterson had engaged in two other extramarital affairs prior to Amber Frey. Frey approached the police about Peterson, who had denied to police that he was having an affair.

Recovery of Laci and Conner's remains On April 13, 2003, a couple walking their dog found the decomposing but well-preserved body of a late-term male fetus in a marshy area of the San Francisco Bay shore in Richmond's Point Isabel Regional Shoreline park, north of Berkeley.\\"Man Describes Finding Body of Peterson Fetus\\" .

Laci's cervix was intact. The exact date and cause of Laci's death were never determined. She had suffered two cracked ribs but Dr. Peterson could not determine if this occurred before or after her death. Laci's upper torso had been emptied of internal organs except for the uterus, which protected the fetus, explaining the lower level of decomposition it experienced. Dr. Peterson determined the fetus had been expelled from Laci's decaying body, though he could not determine whether it was alive or dead when this occurred. The discovery of the bodies created a greater sense of urgency for Brocchini and Buehler, who had put a tracker on Peterson's car. Knowing that he was in San Diego at the time, they feared he would escape across the border to Mexico. Brocchini commented in 2017, \\"I just thought, 'We've got to find Scott right now.

His naturally dark brown hair had been dyed blonde, and his Mercedes-Benz was \\"overstuffed\\" with miscellaneous items, including nearly $15,000 in cash, twelve Viagra tablets, survival gear, camping equipment,Vries, Lloyd (October 26, 2004). \\"Scott Peterson's Parents Testify\\" . CBS News. several changes of clothes, four cell phones, and his brother's driver's license, in addition to his own. Peterson's father explained that he used his brother's license the day before to get a San Diego resident discount at the golf course and that Peterson had been living out of his car because of the media attention. However, police suspected these items were an indication that Peterson planned to flee to Mexico, an idea prosecutors would later concur with. On April 21, 2003, Peterson was arraigned before Judge Nancy Ashley in Stanislaus County Superior Court. He was charged with two felony counts of murder with premeditation and special circumstances: the first-degree murder of Laci and the second-degree murder of Conner. He pleaded not guilty. and was held with bail. Trial Before his arraignment, Peterson had been represented by Kirk McAllister, a veteran criminal defense attorney from Modesto. Chief Deputy Public Defender Kent Faulkner was also assigned to the case. Peterson later indicated that he could afford a private attorney, namely Mark Geragos, who had done other high-profile criminal defense work. On January 20, 2004, a judge changed the venue of the trial from Modesto to Redwood City, because Peterson was the victim of increasing hostility in the Modesto area. Peterson's trial began on June 1, 2004, and was followed closely by the news media. The lead prosecutor was Rick Distaso while Geragos led Peterson's defense. In opening statements, Geragos claimed Peterson was \\"a cad\\" for cheating on Laci but was not a murderer. Prosecution witness Frey hired her own attorney, Gloria Allred, to represent her. Allred was not bound by the gag order imposed on those involved in the trial. Although she maintained that her client had no opinion about whether Peterson was guilty, Allred was openly sympathetic to the prosecution. She appeared frequently on television news programs during the trial. Prosecutors claimed Peterson made cement anchors to weigh his wife's body down in San Francisco Bay, however none were found when the Bay was searched, even though sonar could locate small objects on the sea floor. The defense questioned whether the investigation was thorough since Modesto police Detective Mike Hermos admitted he did not check the alibi of a prostitute who was accused of stealing checks from Peterson's mailbox but Hermos did not indicate that the woman was ever a suspect and prosecutor Dave Harris noted that the checks were stolen after Laci vanished, precluding the woman from involvement in her disappearance. A police community service officer testified that an interview with Peterson had no sound due to no batteries being put in a tape recorder. Other detectives were called to testify about the extensive search for evidence. Peterson's defense lawyers based their case on the lack of direct evidence and played down the significance of circumstantial evidence. They suggested the fetal remains were of a full-term infant and theorized that someone kidnapped Laci, held her until she gave birth and then dumped both bodies in the bay. The prosecution's medical experts contended that the baby was not full-term and died at the same time as his mother. Juror Frances Gorman was removed and replaced early in the trial due to misconduct. Jury foreman and attorney Gregory Jackson later requested his own removal during jury deliberations, most likely because his fellow jurors wanted to replace him as foreman.

The hair, matched through DNA comparison to hair from Laci's hairbrush, was stuck to pliers found on Peterson's boat. Presented as prosecution evidence during the trial was the fact that Peterson changed his appearance and purchased a vehicle using his mother's name in order to avoid recognition by the press. He added two pornographic television channels to his cable service only days after his wife's disappearance. The prosecution stated this meant he knew she would not be returning home. Peterson expressed interest in selling the house he had shared with Laci, and traded in her Land Rover for a Dodge pick-up truck. Rick Cheng, a hydrologist with the United States Geological Survey and an expert witness on tides of the San Francisco Bay, testified as a witness for the prosecution. During cross-examination, Cheng admitted that his findings were \\"probable, not precise.\\" Tidal systems are sufficiently chaotic, and he was unable to develop an exact model of the bodies' disposal and travel. As the trial progressed, the prosecution opened discussion of Peterson's affair with Frey and the contents of their secretly-recorded telephone calls. Charles March, a fertility specialist, was expected to be a crucial witness for the defense, one who, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, could single- handedly exonerate Peterson by showing that Laci's fetus died a week after prosecutors claimed. Under cross-examination, March admitted basing his findings on an anecdote from one of Laci's friends that she had taken a home pregnancy test on June 9, 2002. When prosecutors pointed out that no medical records relied on the June 9 date, March became flustered and confused on the stand and asked a prosecutor to cut him \\"some slack\\", undermining his credibility. Summing up this key defense witness, Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles said, \\"There were moments today that reminded me of Chernobyl.\\"Finz, Stacy; Walsh, Dian (October 22, 2004). \\"THE PETERSON TRIAL / Defense witness asks D.A. to cut him slack / Expert says fetus died days after mother disappeared\\" .

According to one newspaper account about March's testimony, \\"By the end of his testimony Thursday, legal analysts and jurors closed their notebooks, rolled their eyes and snickered when they thought no one was looking\\". =Motive= The prosecution presented Peterson's affair with Frey, financial problems and impending fatherhood as motives for the murder, surmising that he killed Laci due to increasing debt and a desire to be single again. =Verdict and sentencing= San Quentin State Prison, where Peterson is incarcerated On November 12, 2004, the jury convicted Peterson of two counts of murder: first- degree murder with special circumstances for killing Laci, and second-degree murder for killing the fetus she carried. The penalty phase of the trial began on November 30, and concluded December 13, when the jury rendered a sentence of death. On March 16, Judge Alfred A. Delucchi followed the jury verdict, sentencing Peterson to death by lethal injection and ordering him to pay $10,000 toward the cost of Laci's funeral, calling the murder of Laci \\"cruel, uncaring, heartless, and callous\\". In later press appearances, members of the jury stated that they believed Peterson's demeanor‚Äîspecifically his lack of emotion and the phone calls to Frey in the days following Laci's disappearance‚Äîindicated that he was guilty. They based their verdict on \\"hundreds of small 'puzzle pieces' of circumstantial evidence that were revealed during the trial, from the location of Laci's body to the myriad lies her husband told after her disappearance\\". The jury decided on the death penalty because they felt that Peterson betrayed his responsibility to protect his wife and son. On October 21, 2005, a judge ruled that proceeds from a $250,000 life insurance policy Peterson took out on Laci would go to Laci's mother, which was reaffirmed by the Fifth District Court of Appeal on October 21, 2005. Peterson's automatic appeal was filed in the California Supreme Court on July 5, 2012. Peterson arrived at San Quentin State Prison in the early morning hours of Wednesday, March 17, 2005. He was reported not to have slept the night before, being too \\"jazzed\\" to sleep. He joined the more than 700 other inmates in California's sole death row facility while his case is on automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of California.Abad-Santos, Alexander (July 6, 2012). \\"Scott Peterson Won't Be Executed Anytime Soon\\" . The Atlantic. In September 2006, former congressman William E. Dannemeyer sent a letter to the California Attorney General and other officials arguing that Laci Peterson had been killed by members of a Satanic cult, not by Peterson. Appeal and death sentence overturn On July 6, 2012, Peterson's attorney, Cliff Gardner, filed a 423-page appeal of Peterson's sentence, stated that the publicity surrounding the trial, incorrect evidentiary rulings, and other mistakes deprived Peterson of a fair trial. The State Attorney General's office filed their response brief on January 26, 2015. The defense filed a response to the State's brief in July 2015, claiming that a certified dog that detected Laci's scent at Berkeley Marina had failed two-thirds of tests with similar conditions. In November 2015, the defense filed a habeas corpus petition, claiming that a juror lied on her jury application, and that there was evidence that neighbors saw Laci alive after Scott left home. On August 10, 2017, the State Attorney General responded to the appeal by filing a 150-page document contesting the notion disputing the claims put forward in the appeal, stating that the appeal ignored \\"overwhelming evidence\\" that Peterson murdered Laci. Supervising Deputy Attorney General Donna Provenzano stated that the timeline of the crime was established by the neighbor who found the Petersons' Golden Retriever, McKenzie, wandering in the street with its leash still attached, before the sightings of Laci and her dog. Provenzano also indicated, \\"Purported sightings of Laci were legion,\\" noting 74 reported sightings in 26 states and overseas, most of which she stated, were neither viable nor corroborated. In August 2018, the defense filed a reply, the sixth brief filed. The brief included six claims of \\"deficient performance‚Äù by trial attorney Mark Geragos, such as failing to call experts in fetal growth, dog scent, how bodies move in water, stating that he would call witnesses but failing to follow through on this, and failing to properly address burglary evidence. On June 2, 2020 the California Supreme Court heard argument on Scott Peterson's appeal. The defense argued that prospective jurors were improperly excused; that the trial judge improperly allowed two jurors on to Peterson's boat; that the judge erred in insisting the prosecution be present during defense testing of the boat; and that the motion to move the trial to another county should have been granted due to juror questionnaire results showing almost half of the prospective jurors had already concluded Peterson was guilty prior to the trial. The prosecution countered that the California Supreme Court should only overturn the verdict if it were to find that a prospective juror was improperly dismissed, and that \\"there was 'no credible claim' that any of the 12 jurors who decided Peterson‚Äôs fate were unfair or partial.\\" On August 24, 2020, in a 7 - 0 decision, the Supreme Court of California upheld Peterson's conviction, but overturned his death sentence, because Peterson's trial judge, Alfred Delucchi, who had died on February 26, 2008, had dismissed jurors who opposed capital punishment without asking them whether they could put their views aside. Justice Leondra Kruger explained that per Supreme Court rulings since 1968, \\"Jurors may not be excused merely for opposition to the death penalty, but only for views rendering them unable to fairly consider imposing that penalty in accordance with their oath. This is the meaning of the guarantee of an impartial jury.\\" Media portrayals * In 2004, Peterson was played by Dean Cain in The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story. * In 2004, E! aired an episode of The E!

It is part of the larger volcanic complex of Capelo, which includes 20 scoria cones and lava fields that are aligned west-northwest to east-southeast from the Cabe√ßo Gordo caldera. Although the name \\"Capelinhos\\" is associated with the volcano, it technically refers to the western cape of the parish of Capelo. It can be considered the westernmost point of Europe; there are more westerly islands in the Azores archipelago but they lie on the North American Plate. A volcanic eruption lasted for 13 months, from September 27, 1957 until October 24, 1958, which may have been two overlapping volcanic eruptions. While enlarging the land by 2.4 km¬≤, it spawned 300 seismic events, hurled ash 1 km, destroyed 300 houses in the parishes of Capelo and Praia do Norte and caused the evacuation of 2,000 people (emigration to the US and Canada). On October 25, the volcano entered a period of dormancy. It is a part of an active fissural volcanic complex which creates multiple seismic and volcanic events. Geography Capelinhos is located along the Capelo Volcanic Complex, that comprises a western area of fissural volcanism and historical eruptions leading away from the Cabe√ßo do Fogo. The events that began in 1957 were an extension of the volcanic activity that abruptly ended at Costado da Nau, the escarpment at Ponta dos Capelinhos. Similar to the Horta Platform, the peninsula is consistent with the shapes and products resulting from Surtseyan, Strombolian and Hawaiian volcanic types. The formation is composed primarily of basaltic rocks, although, less frequently, Hawaiian hawaiitic rocks are observed. Capelinhos is classified a Surtseyan eruption, since it was formed in the relatively shallow coast of the Faial seamount. As the volcano pre-dates the eruption of Surtsey, which defined the type, by five years, some refer to this type of eruption as Capelinian. Located at Cabe√ßo Norte, a volcanic vent releases water vapour with temperatures between 180 ¬∞C and 200 ¬∞C from the volcano complex. History Capelinhos Volcano, Faial Island, Azores, showing the lighthouse which marked the western coastal limit of Ponta dos Capelinhos The Capelinhos eruption represented the first time that a submarine eruption was documented from beginning to end. Its location near an inhabited island with good communications meant it could be intensively studied. The first activities during the eruption were identified by engineer Frederico Machado, the Director of the District Public Works Department, his assistant engineer Jo√£o do Nascimento and surveyor Ant√≥nio Denis, under the authorization of the Civil Governor, Freitas Pimentel. The Director of the Observatory in Angra, Lieutenant-Colonel Jos√© Agostinho overflew the area, and Bernado Almada (at the Prince Albert of Monaco Observatory, in Horta) sent several bulletins relating the increased seismic activity of the area. Between September 16 and 27, 1957, 200 earthquakes of intensity V (Moderate) on the Mercalli scale were registered.Silva, M.A. & Gaspar J.L., (2007). p.47 On September 23, the ocean waters off the coast of Ponte dos Capelinhos began to boil, and the first vapours were witnessed around 6:30 a.m. one kilometre northwest of the lighthouse. A constant tremor could be sensed, at times reaching a Level IV on the Mercalli scale (MM-31). Three days later, the activity increased; black ash (to about 1400 m) and water vapour (to about 4000 m) rose west of the two ilh√©us () off the coast. On September 27, beginning at about 6:45 in the morning, a submarine eruption, 300 m from Ponta dos Capelinhos (100 m from the Ilh√©us dos Capelinhos) began. Whale spotters at Costado da Nau, a few meters above the Capelinhos lighthouse, saw the ocean churning to the west and alerted the lighthouse keepers. On October 5: \\"...the clouds of clay likely rose about one kilometre in height and solid fragments...reaching an area of 1200 metres around...\\" The buildings in the area began to experience the first damages: windows were broken, tiles fell from the roofs. By the next day, the first ash-fall began on land; \\"in a few hours a black mat covered the extreme West of island...\\", reaching 2.5 kilometres from the crater, necessitating the evacuation of the settlements of Norte Pequeno and Canto. Initially, gases and pyroclastic explosions persisted until October 13, while gradually diminishing, but were rapidly replaced by violent explosions, lava bombs, ash and lava streaming into the sea. This intense eruption occurred until the end of October with constant ash raining on Faial, destroying cultural lands, inhibiting normal farming and forcing the residents from local villages to evacuate. By October 10, the eruption had initially formed a small island, baptized Ilha Nova (), Ilha dos Capelinhos () or Ilha do Esp√≠rito Santo () by the locals, 600 meter diameter and 30 meter height with an open crater to the sea. By October 29, the island grew to 99 meters high and 800 meters in diameter of coarse black ash. By the end of the first phase of the eruption, three reporters, Carlos Tudela and Vasco Hogan Teves from public television R√°dio e Televis√£o de Portugal (RTP), journalist Urbano Carrasco (from the newspaper Di√°rio Popular) and boat pilot Carlos Raulino Peixoto risked their lives by traveling to the Ilha Nova. Arriving on the island, they planted a Portuguese flag, before hurriedly leaving. The New Island had disappeared into the sea by 30 October. The lighthouse at Capelinhos. On November 4, 1957 a second volcanic event occurred rapidly, forming a second island, and by 12 November 1957 an isthmus had formed linking it with Faial. Explosions and ejecta increased progressively, reaching a climax by 15 December when a second cone was formed.Silva, M.A. & Gaspar J.L., (2007). p.50 Following a night of torrential rains and ash (on or about 16 November) the explosive activity ceased, and an effusive lava phase began with more ash and explosive rock. By then the largest eruptive column had reached 1450 metres into the air, carrying with it ash from the northwest for a distance of 20 kilometres (6 December). A final pause began on 29 December. Between January and April 1958, new showers of ash and accompanying water vapour (both white and darkened) persisted, and the two Ilh√©us off the coast of Ponte dos Capelinhos had disappeared under the sand and ash. During this period the cinder cone and isthmus became an integral part of the island of Faial, destroying the roofs of the local buildings and infilling the space to the lighthouse. From May 12‚Äì18, 450 seismic events were recorded as the volcano moved into a Strombolian phase, emitting projectiles 500 m into the air, causing moderate explosions and accompanied by infra-sonic waves that shook doors and windows on the island and some adjacent islands. This final phase lasted several months: the last lava currents were visible on 21 October, and the last projectiles were reported on 24 October. During this final stage (around 14 May), fumaroles were discovered inside Faial's caldera, that began emitting sulfurous water vapor, boiling clay and mud. Although one person nearly fell into the Capelinhos crater, there were no deaths from the eruption; generally, ash deposits and some projectiles caused the destruction of homes and the blanketing of agricultural lands in the parishes of Capelo and Praia do Norte. A report presented on 15 January 1958 indicated that 164 families had been affected by the eruption. Due to the close relationship between Portugal and the United States, refugees from the beleaguered parishes emigrated. The Azorean Refugee Act (September 2, 1958), authorized the emigration of 1,500 people and was sponsored by Democratic Congressmen John O. Pastore of Rhode Island, and a young Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In addition to many families from the area of Capelo, other citizens of the Azores benefited from these temporary measures. This resulted in a 50% decrease of the resident population of Capelo, and contributed to an increased standard of living, greater working opportunities and some improvements in base incomes. Tourism The volcano is a landmark on Faial; its ruined lighthouse and Visitors Center (which lies along the cliff from the volcano) is a tourist destination. A trail network runs from the Visitors Center and lighthouse to the caldera summit. On September 27, 2007, commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of the eruption and its effects on the island's history and people were broadcast in Portugal and throughout the Azorean diaspora.

Belushi plays bad-tempered San Diego police detective Michael Dooley, who has been tagged for execution by a major international drug dealer named Ken Lyman (played by Kevin Tighe). To help, K-9 Sergeant Brannigan (played by Ed O'Neill) gives Dooley an unorthodox drug-sniffing police dog called \\"Jerry Lee\\" (named after rock-and-roll singer Jerry Lee Lewis). The duo attempt to put Lyman behind bars but Dooley quickly learns Jerry Lee is a mischievous smart aleck who works only when and how he wants to. Many of the film's gags revolve around Jerry Lee's playfully destructive episodes. The film has two direct-to-video sequels, K-911 (1999) and K-9: P.I. (2002). K-9 was released exactly three months before Turner & Hooch (with Tom Hanks), which had a similar plot. There is also an unsold pilot for loosely related TV series K-9000 (1991) available as a TV movie. Plot San Diego Police Detective Michael Dooley leaves his car to contact his girlfriend, Tracy, when a helicopter suddenly appears and opens fire on his car, which ignites. Presuming him dead, the assassins leave the scene. At the police station, Dooley argues with his lieutenant, refusing to take a partner; instead, he decides to get a police dog. At home, he finds Tracy with another man and spends the night in his new car. The next day, Dooley coerces Freddie, an informant, into revealing that the drug lord Ken Lyman is responsible for the attack. Dooley is assigned a German Shepherd named Jerry Lee, whom he dislikes. Dooley and Jerry Lee head to a warehouse assumed to be filled with drugs. When Jerry Lee does not follow Dooley's orders, the workers laugh at him. Dooley is forced to leave after Jerry Lee finds only a cigarette when commanded to find drugs. The duo drive to a pub where Dooley stakes out Benny the Mule in an attempt to charge Lyman. When his cover is blown, Jerry Lee saves Dooley from a beating; with the dog's help, Dooley subdues Benny and learns the location of Lyman's next shipment. Meanwhile, Lyman kills Freddie and demands that his henchman Dillon kill Dooley before the shipment arrives. At Dooley's apartment, Jerry Lee steals the spotlight after Tracy accepts Dooley's story that he rescued the dog from the streets. The next day, Dooley and Jerry Lee bond when they eat together and spy on Lyman. The two are nearly killed when someone shoots at them, and the two chase the assailant to an empty building. Jerry Lee leads Dooley to the man, who falls to his death after a fistfight with Dooley. In the man's car, Dooley finds a clue that leads him to an auto-dealer shop. There, Jerry Lee identifies a red Mercedes owned by Lyman, and Dooley learns from Halstead, the owner of the dealership, that he works for Lyman. Later, Jerry Lee falls in love with a poodle to the disapproval of its owner. When Dooley returns home, he discovers Lyman has kidnapped Tracy. Infuriated, Dooley crashes a party at Lyman's mansion and demands her return. Lyman pretends to know nothing, and Dooley is arrested by an officer from his own department and put in a squad car. Angry, Dooley's lieutenant calls him crazy. When Jerry Lee's flatulence annoys the other officers, Dooley uses it to his advantage and escapes with the dog. As Dooley tells Jerry Lee how he met Tracy, he spots a truck driven by Halstead that is pulling a trailer with Lyman's Mercedes. Dooley purses the truck, and Halstead blows a tire. After Halstead shoots at Dooley, Jerry Lee kills Halstead. Meanwhile, in a stranded desert in San Diego, Lyman holds Tracy hostage in his limo and becomes suspicious when Halstead is late. Dooley arrives with the truck and trailer, which is revealed to be the next shipment of drugs. Not worrying about the case anymore, Dooley orders Lyman to surrender his girlfriend to him, or he will blow up the truck. Lyman calls Dooley's bluff, and a shootout ensues. Dooley kills Lyman's henchmen Dillon and Jerry Lee chases Lyman as he runs for his helicopter. Unable to outrun the dog, Lyman shoots Jerry Lee; enraged, Dooley shoots at Lyman but misses. Lyman is, instead, shot and killed by his associates who were waiting in the helicopter. Dooley and Tracy rush Jerry Lee to a hospital, where the reluctant surgeon operates. In the recovery room, Dooley delivers a eulogy to Jerry Lee, not knowing that he is alive. When the surgeon tells him he is going to be fine, Dooley responds in anger, thinking he was speaking to a dead dog. Jerry Lee licks Dooley's face out of love, making him give in. To take a break from police work, Dooley, Tracy, Jerry Lee, and a poodle spend a vacation together in Las Vegas.

The town is directly serviced by Routes 104, 204, 301, and 321. Despite its small size and demographic, Oxford is the world's largest processor and distributor of individually quick frozen (IQF) wild blueberries. History Oxford was founded in 1791 by settler Richard Thompson. The name \\"Oxford\\" is derived from the shallow river that was used to enter the town. Early settlers used oxen to cross, or \\"ford\\", the river, and thus derived the town's name. Geography Oxford is located at the junctions of three rivers, the largest of which is River Philip. Much of the town lies in a floodplain and floods are common during the springtime. Salt Lake is located between the Black River Road and the Trans Canada Highway. A series of swamps and meadows connect this lake to the River Philip.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Oxford recorded a population of 1,190 living in 528 of its 597 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 1,151. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Industry  Oxford is considered the wild blueberry capital of Canada as it is centred in a large blueberry growing region. Oxford Frozen Foods Ltd., a wild blueberry processor, is the largest employer in the town, processing up to three million pounds of berries a day during peak season.http://oxfordfrozenfoods.com/facilities The plant and over 12,000 acres of blueberry land are owned by local businessman, John Bragg, who added in 2014 another 15,700 acres in the Acadian region of northern New Brunswick.acadienouvelle.com: \\"La production de bleuets sauvages prend de l‚Äôexpansion au Nouveau Brunswick\\", 21 Apr 2016 Historically, the town was home to a vibrant manufacturing industry with a woollen mill and foundry being key employers. Transportation Centrally located in Cumberland County, Oxford is well connected to the provincial and national road network. The Trans Canada Highway (Highway 104) passed near just south of the town and provincial routes 204, 301, and 321 all travel through town via Pugwash Road, Birchwood Road, Water Street, Upper/Lower Main Street and Little River Road. In terms of public transport, the town is serviced by Maritime Bus, which stops at the Irving gas station not far off the highway. Historically, the town had freight and passenger rail service via CN's Oxford Subdivision,http://www.novascotiarailwayheritage.com/photos.htm#OXFORD known locally as the 'Short Line', which ran from Oxford Junction to Stellarton. Passenger service was discontinued in 1960 and the line was abandoned in the 1990s.

Named for its distinctive saddle-shaped profile when viewed from the west, it is a well-known symbol of the city of Monterrey, despite being located in the adjacent municipality of Guadalupe. It covers an area of 60.5 square kilometres (23 mi¬≤). The mountain has four peaks: Pico Antena, Pico Norte, Pico Sur and Pico la Virgen; Pico Norte (North Peak) is the highest at 1820 m (5970 ft) while Pico la Virgen (Virgin's Peak) is the lowest at 1750 m (5740 ft). Set aside as a natural monument by the Mexican government in 1991, the mountain, or hill, as mountains are often referred to in Mexico, is a popular recreational area and is often climbed by hikers who take a 5.3 km (3.3 mi) trail to reach the top. The ascent is considered to be fairly difficult, taking approximately 3 hours to complete. A panoramic view of the city of Monterrey can be seen from the top. In the second half of the 20th century, an aerial tramway (Telef√©rico en Monterrey) was built on the north side of the mountain to give a fastest access to the iconic mountain for the population.https://marcos.kirsch.mx/2011/09/20/the-tragic-cerro-de-la-silla- aerial-tramway/ The day of its inauguration on June 2, 1961 was also the day of its closure, as a tragic accident took the lives of five people, including the engineer Jes√∫s Fern√°ndez, its designer.

A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, he took 1,956 wickets in first-class cricket at an average of 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40 Tests at an average of 24.37. Named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is regarded as one of the most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be almost impossible to bat against. Verity was born in Leeds and, from an early age, wished to play cricket for Yorkshire. After establishing a good reputation in local cricket, he signed a contract as a professional cricketer playing in the Lancashire League. His first season was not a success but, after moving clubs, he began to make a name for himself. Initially a medium- paced bowler, he switched to bowling spin in an attempt to secure a place in the Yorkshire team. When Wilfred Rhodes, the incumbent Yorkshire left-arm spinner, announced his retirement, Verity had a successful trial in the team in 1930, and led the national bowling averages. In 1931, his first full season, he achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, against Warwickshire; the following year, he again took all 10 wickets, against Nottinghamshire, while conceding just 10 runs. The latter bowling figures remain a record in first-class cricket for the fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets. He established himself as part of a strong bowling unit, which assisted Yorkshire to the County Championship seven times in his ten seasons with the club. In that time, Verity was never lower than fifth in the bowling averages and took over 150 wickets in every year except his first. In 1931, he was chosen to play for England for the first time and rose to prominence during a tour to Australia in 1932‚Äì33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best performance of his career when he took 15 wickets against Australia in a Test match at Lord's in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting pitches, and he was occasionally left out of the England team over the following years. Even so, he had one of the best records of any bowler against Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket. Verity continued to play for Yorkshire and England until 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War ended his career. Verity joined the Green Howards in 1939, and after training was posted overseas to India, Persia and Egypt, achieving the rank of captain. During the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Verity was severely wounded and captured by the Germans. Taken to the Italian mainland, he died in Caserta from his injuries and was buried there. Early years Verity was born in Headingley, an area of Leeds, on 18 May 1905. He was the eldest child of Hedley Verity, who worked for a local coal company, and Edith Elwick, a Sunday school teacher. Verity also had two sisters, Grace and Edith.Hill, pp. 13, 15. The family moved to Armley, then to the more rural location of Rawdon.Hill, pp. 14, 16. From an early age, Verity watched Yorkshire play County Cricket matches at Leeds, Bradford and, during family holidays, Scarborough.Hill, p. 18. Later, at Yeadon and Guiseley Secondary School, Verity played school cricket, bowling left-arm medium-paced deliveries; he maintained this style until 1929 and was capable of bowling both inswingers and outswingers.Hill, p. 23. Verity left school aged 14 to work for his father, who had established a coal business in Guiseley,Hill, pp. 18‚Äì19. and played cricket for Rawdon's second team.Hill, p. 19. Success on the field persuaded Verity to seek a career in professional cricket and a place in the Yorkshire team.Hill, pp. 19‚Äì20. While working for his father, he devoted increasing amounts of time to cricket practice.Hill, pp. 21‚Äì22. In 1921, Verity made his debut for Rawdon in league cricket; some of his subsequent performances attracted the notice of the local press, and he took 29 wickets at an average of 13.80 that season. The following season, he was spotted by Yorkshire coach George Hirst and former England spinner Bobby Peel, who were talent scouting for Yorkshire, and given a trial in the cricket nets at Headingley. Peel realised Verity was an intelligent bowler who had excellent control of where he pitched the ball, but believed he was not fast enough to be effective for Yorkshire.Hill, p. 24. Meanwhile, critics in Rawdon began to see increased potential in his batting, which improved steadily; by 1924, the Yorkshire Evening Post described Verity as \\"one of the most promising cricketers in the Leeds district\\".Hill, pp. 24‚Äì25. Verity moved to play for Horsforth Hall Park in 1924, where his batting became more productive than his bowling.Hill, pp. 25‚Äì26. By 1926, when he scored a total of 488 runs and took 62 wickets to win the Yorkshire Council League prize for best junior bowler, his all-round potential secured a second trial at Yorkshire. Receiving coaching from Hirst, Verity played several matches for the Yorkshire Colts. He was given little bowling to do, suggesting that he was chosen more for his batting at this stage, and was near the bottom of the team's bowling averages. Hill. p. 26. Yorkshire did not allocate him to a local club, their practice towards promising cricketers at the time. Hirst was nevertheless impressed by VerityHill, pp. 26‚Äì27. and recommended him to Accrington Cricket Club, a team in the Lancashire League looking for a professional cricketer. After a trial, Verity signed a contract in September 1926.Hill, pp. 29‚Äì31. League professional Verity was unsuccessful during the 1927 season, his only one with Accrington. His bowling was less effective than the club had hoped; he endured spells where he took few wickets and was unable to implement the tactics or bowl in the style that the club expected. His batting average for the season was 5.25. The team, containing players far more experienced than Verity, were unimpressed by his performances and unsympathetic to his difficulties, offering him little support in the field.Hill, pp. 31‚Äì33. Even so, the club were prepared to offer an improved contract for 1928, but he declined as Accrington had previously refused to release their players for county cricket.Hill, pp. 33‚Äì34. Verity signed a contract with Middleton, a club in the Central Lancashire Cricket League. Limited in resources, the club paid him less than Accrington, but guaranteed his release to play for Yorkshire if he were selected. Playing with young teammates, Verity worked hard to coach the players and develop team spirit.Hill, pp. 34‚Äì35. He made a modest start in his first season, and was initially rated as a useful but unimpressive all-rounder. A visit to the Yorkshire nets around this time prompted Verity to alter his bowling style. Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main spinner since 1898, was considering retirement; he and Hirst suggested that, as there were fewer spinners than medium-pace bowlers, Verity was more likely to achieve selection if he switched to spin bowling.Hill, p. 36. With the support of the Middleton team and committee, Verity started bowling spin at the beginning of the 1929 season and immediately began to attract attention from counties, culminating in an unsuccessful nets trial for Warwickshire.Hill, pp. 36‚Äì37. Later in the season, when Verity went to Headingley to watch Yorkshire play, he was asked to fill a vacancy in the Yorkshire Colts team. In the match, he took five wickets for seven runs in the second innings.Hill, p. 39. By the end of the season, he had taken 100 wickets for Middleton and topped the Central Lancashire League bowling averages. For the 1930 season, Verity received lucrative contract offers from several Lancashire League clubs, worth more than three times his Middleton salary. Although recently married and receiving little encouragement from the Yorkshire committee, he eventually rejected the offers.Hill, pp. 37‚Äì38. In the event, Middleton allowed Verity to play for Yorkshire during 1930 and later released him from his contract. Cricket historian Derek Hodgson notes that Verity's years in the Lancashire Leagues \\"meant that he reached Yorkshire ... as a hardened and experienced performer\\".Hodgson, p. 129. County cricketer =First-class debut= Wilfred Rhodes, Verity's predecessor as Yorkshire's left-arm spinner Early in 1930, Wilfred Rhodes announced that he intended to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season.Hill, p. 41. Several spin bowlers were considered as his replacement; Hirst, who watched them all bowl in the nets, considered Verity the most impressive.Hodgson, p. 128. Verity made his first-class debut on 21 May 1930 in an early-season non- Championship match against Sussex. Rhodes, who missed the match, spent the game watching Verity and seemed convinced afterwards that his successor had been found. Bowling in two innings, Verity took three wickets for 96 in 46.1 overs; in the process, he won praise from the press, particularly for preventing the batsmen from scoring. Rhodes returned for the next match; Verity appeared only once more in May, taking eight wickets in the match against Leicestershire, and once in June.Woodhouse, p. 367. In his fourth game, he took nine for 60 in the second innings against Glamorgan and 12 wickets in the match. Rain had damaged the pitch, making it difficult to bat against spinners.Hill, p. 42. After this, Verity played regularly alongside Rhodes, and, helped by a succession of rain-affected pitches, took a total of 64 wickets in 12 games at an average of 12.42, figures which placed him top of the national bowling averages.Hill, p. 40. His best performance came against Hampshire when he took 13 wickets for 83 runs, including seven for 26 in the first innings. Rhodes and Emmott Robinson, the senior professionals in the Yorkshire team, discussed tactics with Verity and his friend and teammate Bill Bowes, to analyse their errors. Bowes later wrote: \\"To Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson ... I owe most for what I learned of first-class cricket‚Äîand Hedley Verity shared my debt.\\"Bowes, p. 58. Verity enjoyed long technical discussions with Rhodes and, according to Hirst, took in the advice \\"like a sponge takes water\\".Hill, p. 44. Even successful performances were critiqued, including Verity's against Glamorgan and Hampshire.Hill, p. 43.Bowes, p. 59. At the end of the season, critics in the press seemed convinced a successor to Rhodes had been found, and Verity was spoken of as a certainty to become an England regular. =Test debut= When the 1931 season started, many critics and journalists watched Verity closely to see how he compared to Rhodes. Their initial impressions were favourable as Verity took five for 42 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Yorkshire's first match of the season and five for 42 against Cambridge University.Hill, p. 47. Then, in his fifth game, Verity became only the second man, after Alonzo Drake, to take all 10 wickets in a single innings for Yorkshire. Against Warwickshire, on his 26th birthday, Verity took 10 for 36 in the second innings, having taken three wickets in the first innings, to give Yorkshire an innings victory.Hill, pp. 48‚Äì50. Verity followed this performance with five for 54 against Lancashire, but a week after his 10 wickets against Warwickshire, Frank Woolley hit four sixes from Verity's bowling as the Yorkshire bowler conceded 70 runs from 12 overs without taking a wicket.Hill, p. 51. The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen's first innings. He was also selected in the less prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Scarborough and was awarded his county cap by Yorkshire.Hill, p. 52. Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team, Verity was selected in the final two Test matches of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity. On his debut, he took four wickets for 75 runs in the game. The Cricketer noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin the ball well. England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl.Hill, pp. 52‚Äì53. In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188 wickets at an average of 13.52, finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages. Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to Wisden, owed much of their success to Verity's bowling. Verity was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in the pace and flight of his bowling. =World record= Bowes and Verity in 1932 Yorkshire made a poor start to the 1932 season. The team lost heavily to Lancashire, for whom Eddie Paynter scored 152 runs and hit Verity for five sixes.Hodgson, p. 132. Although Verity had figures of eight for 107, he was expected to be more successful as the pitch conditions were perfect for spin bowling. Neville Cardus wrote that his figures were \\"bad for the pitch. He can spin the ball keenly enough, but lacks a plan in his control of length. Moreover, he seldom gets the batsman guessing while the ball is in the air.\\"Cardus (1982), p. 335. However, Yorkshire improved their form in the rest of the season to retain the County title.Hodgson, pp. 132, 135. Between them, Verity and Bowes took 352 wickets in the season, and Verity took 162 wickets at an average of 13.88 to finish second in the national bowling averages. Verity's best performance of the season came at Headingley on 12 July, the third and final day of Yorkshire's match against Nottinghamshire. After heavy rain on the second day, Brian Sellers, the Yorkshire captain, closed his team's innings while they still trailed by 71 runs. When Nottinghamshire began their second innings, Verity did not concede any runs from his first nine overs. Subsequently, the pitch became difficult to bat on as it dried in the sun and Verity took all 10 wickets while 10 runs were hit from his bowling. Making the ball spin sharply, he took seven wickets in 15 deliveries, including a hat-trick.Hill, pp. 53‚Äì55. His bowling figures of 10 for 10 beat the previous record for fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets, and remain the best bowling analysis in first-class cricket. He is the only Yorkshire bowler to take all 10 wickets in an innings on two separate occasions. Yorkshire won the match by 10 wickets. Despite Verity's success, he was not selected for any Gentlemen v Players matches, nor in the Test match against India. His only representative cricket came in a Test trial at the end of July, in which he did not bowl as the match was washed out by rain. Verity had been advised by friends at the start of the season that he would need an exceptional performance to achieve selection on the 1932‚Äì33 Ashes tour of Australia; Alan Hill believes the performance against Nottinghamshire guaranteed Verity would be chosen to tour.Hill, p. 56. In the middle of August, Verity was one of the last men added to the MCC team captained by Douglas Jardine.Frith, p. 53. International cricketer =Bodyline tour= alt=Close up of a young man Jardine planned to use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested.Frith, p. 61. However, Verity was not expected to be a big success on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity's lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack,Hill, p. 58. but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of Don Bradman, against a Combined XI, comprising some of the best Australian players.Hill, p. 59.Frith, p. 83. In the following game, against South Australia, Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings.Frith, pp. 90‚Äì91. By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity's achievements, and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed his admiration for Verity.Hill, p. 61.Frith, p. 87. Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17 overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly.Hill, pp. 63‚Äì63. England won the match, using Bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour.Frith, p. 133. After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first half-century in first-class cricket.Frith, pp. 142‚Äì44. However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.Hill, pp. 65‚Äì66.Frith, p. 146. Verity regained his place in the team for the third Test, replacing Bowes.Frith, p. 173. The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics.Frith, pp. 179‚Äì81, 194, 196‚Äì201. Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45 runs in the first innings and 40 in the second.Frith, p. 178. He took one wicket in the game; after 16 wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338 runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets.Frith, p. 264. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but Wisden noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76 runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis.Frith, pp. 287‚Äì89. The two men scored 92 runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times.Frith, p. 291. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series‚Äîand the Ashes. Verity's bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets.Hill, p. 70. Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.Hill, pp. 70‚Äì72.Frith, pp. 323‚Äì25. In the Test series, Verity totalled 11 wickets at an average of 24.65, second in the bowling averages to Larwood.Hill, p. 181. Verity took three more wickets in his last matches of the tour, which included his appearance in one of the two Tests against New Zealand at the end of the tour. In all first-class games in Australia, he took 44 wickets at 15.86, leading the first-class bowling averages for the tourists; he took one further wicket in New Zealand. Wisden's tour report noted Verity's \\"fine bowling record\\" and that he performed well. Jardine, in a letter to Verity's father, wrote: \\"Hedley has come through his first tour triumphantly, no mean feat to start with the stiffest tour, but particularly for a slow left-hander. On and off the field, Hedley has been a real friend and a grand help to me\\".Hill, pp. 72‚Äì73. =Series against West Indies= In the 1933 season, when Yorkshire won their third consecutive County Championship, Verity took 190 wickets at an average of 13.43 to be fifth in the national averages; in eight matches he took 10 or more wickets, and achieved five wickets in an innings 18 times. In seven consecutive innings, he secured a total of 50 wickets, becoming only the third player to achieve this feat in first-class cricket. He also scored over 600 runs in the season, his highest aggregate to date, including three fifties ‚Äì his first in English first-class cricket. Verity represented the Players against the Gentlemen and played in the first two of three Tests against the West Indies, taking four for 45 in the first match and capturing seven wickets at an average of 21.85 in the series. He was left out of the final game in favour of Charles Marriott,Hill, p. 123. but in two other games against the tourists, Verity took a total of 22 wickets. Against Essex, Verity achieved another record by taking 17 wickets in a single day's play, the second of three players to achieve this feat, on a pitch damaged by rain. In contrast, against Surrey, Yorkshire conceded 560 runs and Verity, frustrated at the lack of a declaration, first bowled extremely negatively and then bowled two underarm deliveries that the umpire called no-ball as Verity had not informed the batsmen of his intention. This was an unusually public reaction for Verity and his captain ordered him to resume normal bowling.Hill, p. 99. At the end of the season, an MCC team toured India and played Tests there for the first time. Jardine was chosen as captain, and Verity was the only other player from the Bodyline series to tour, although others declined an invitation.Frith, pp. 390‚Äì91.Douglas, p. 169. =Tour of India= Douglas Jardine, Verity's captain in Australia and India, was an admirer of Verity. Jardine approached the tour with a competitive attitude and made thorough preparations.Douglas, pp. 170‚Äì71. The match attendances were high and the public followed the cricket very closely. Verity enjoyed the tour and established a lasting friendship with Charlie Barnett; Verity helped Barnett to overcome his homesickness and to develop his understanding of cricket.Hill, pp. 81‚Äì82. Verity was the leading first-class wicket-taker on the tour, although he was second in the team averages, with 72 wickets at an average of 15.54. In the first match of the tour against Sind, he took six for 46 and 10 wickets in the game. His best figures were seven for 37 against the Viceroy's XI and he took five wickets in an innings on five occasions. Against an Indian XI, he achieved his then- highest first-class score of 91 not out. On the same ground, in the second Test match, Verity took eight wickets in the drawn game and scored 55 not out, his maiden Test fifty.Hill, p. 84. As England had won the first Test, the third and final match would decide the series. Verity was again successful with the bat, scoring 42 and sharing a partnership of 97 with Jardine. Then with the ball, Verity took seven for 49 as the Indian batsmen struggled against his accuracy.Hill, p. 83. Four wickets in the second innings gave him eleven wickets for 153 in the match, the first time he had taken 10 or more wickets in a Test match. In the three Tests, Verity took 23 wickets at an average of 16.82, leading the bowling averages for the series.Hill, p. 184. Jardine, who retired from regular first-class cricket after the tour, had little patience with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, when they were having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: \\"Thank God we have one bowler in the side\\"‚Äîreferring to Verity.Frith, p. 391. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity was impressed with the depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely.Hill, pp. 79‚Äì80. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine.Hill, p. 75. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: \\"I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets ... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself.\\" Historian David Frith writes that Verity was \\"probably the cricketer [Jardine] admired above all others\\", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.Hill, p. 76. =Series against Australia in 1934= In the 1934 season, Verity took 150 wickets at an average of 17.63, placing him third in the national averages.Hill, p. 174. That year, the Australians toured England and Verity was selected for all five Test matches. Australia won the first game‚ÄîVerity took two wickets. At Lord's, in the second match, England scored 440 in their first innings but after the second day's play, Australia were well positioned, having reached 192 for two wickets. Verity was the only bowler to trouble the batsmen and caught and bowled Bradman, who had scored a quick 36 runs.Cardus (1934), pp. 181‚Äì83. After rain fell overnight, the pitch changed to become helpful to spin; Wisden reported that: \\"although the wicket certainly helped [Verity] considerably it could scarcely be described as genuinely sticky except for one period after lunch.\\" On the third day, Australia lost their last eight wickets while scoring 92 runs. Verity took six of the wickets to achieve bowling figures of seven for 61. The tourists just failed to score enough runs to make England bat again and were forced to follow on: Cardus wrote: \\"Verity settled the issue like a great bowler\\".Cardus (1934), p. 193. England wicket-keeper Les Ames believed this was crucial to an England victory, or the home team would have batted in very difficult conditions. When Australia batted again, Verity took eight for 43, dismissing Bradman a second time, to give him match figures of 15 for 104; 14 of the wickets came on the third day. Cardus believed the Australian batsmen played very badly against Verity's spin,Cardus (1934), p. 196. while the Wisden correspondent wrote: \\"This amazing achievement would probably have been only possible to a man possessed of such length and finger-spin as Verity ... Verity's length was impeccable and he made the ball come back and lift so abruptly that most of the Australians were helpless. The majority of them had had no experience in England of such a pitch, and they showed no ability or skill in dealing with bowling like that of Verity under these conditions; their efforts at playing back were, to say the least, immature.\\" Afterwards, this game became known in cricket circles as \\"Verity's match\\"; it was the only occasion in the 20th century when England beat Australia at Lord's, and their last such win for 75 years. The third match was played on a very good pitch for batting in extremely hot weather,Cardus (1934), p. 197. and England did not have a strong bowling attack in the view of Wisden. England scored 627, of which Verity scored 60 not out; Wisden commented that he batted slowly but well. Australia replied with 491 when they batted; Verity took four for 78 in 53 overs and was able to prevent the batsmen scoring quickly. The match was eventually drawn. Cardus, in criticising the English bowlers in the game, wrote: \\"Verity is apparently the only England bowler in existence at the present time‚Äîand he is not subtle on a hard wicket.\\"Cardus (1934), p. 227. Poor weather prevented an English defeat in the fourth Test, as Bradman and Bill Ponsford shared a partnership of 388 runs; Verity took three wickets but, in doing so, conceded 113 runs. The final, decisive game, was won by Australia, who therefore regained the Ashes. Bradman and Ponsford this time scored 451 runs together as their team totalled 701; Verity was wicketless in the match and conceded 166 runs. Cardus, assessing the English bowling, regretted that England did not have a bowler capable of flighting the ball, a role usually performed by left- arm spinners.Cardus (1934), p. 262. Verity took 24 wickets in the series at 24.00, finishing second in the averages. Reviewing the series, Wisden editor Sydney Southerton wrote, \\"Verity, apart from his one amazing performance at Lord's, could be complimented upon his steadiness rather than upon his effectiveness on hard wickets\\". Verity also made other representative appearances in the season; Yorkshire dropped to sixth position, handicapped by the limited appearances of four players who were regularly absent at representative matches.Hodgson, p. 138. =Career in the mid-1930s= During the 1935 season Yorkshire regained the County Championship, and Verity passed 200 wickets for the first time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the national averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22 times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1‚Äì0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41 overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30 runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: \\"Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether to hit you for four or six!\\"Bowes, p. 124. South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25 overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40 overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: \\"Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen\\". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball. The Times correspondent wrote: \\"Verity has not been impressive on firm wickets: he seems to have checked suddenly in a career which promised so well three seasons ago, and it is not surprising that he has been left out of this side.\\" Nevertheless, he took 12 wickets at 20.83, leading the Test bowling averages for England.Hill, p. 183. Verity was not selected in any other representative cricket that season. The Yorkshire team played three first-class matches in Jamaica in early 1936.Hill, p. 102. Yorkshire won the first game, Jamaica's first defeat at home in a first-class game for 10 years. Verity took 10 for 106 in 57 overs. The other matches, played on very good batting wickets, were drawn. In the final game, Verity scored 101, his only first-class century. Batting aggressively, he hit 10 fours and his second fifty runs came in just over an hour.Hill, p. 103. In total, Verity took 16 wickets, averaging 22.50, and scored 195 runs at 48.75. In the 1936 English season, in which Yorkshire finished second to Derbyshire in the Championship, Verity took 216 wickets, the highest seasonal total of his career, at an average of 13.18, which placed him second in the national averages. Against Kent, he returned nine wickets for 12 runs and took 15 wickets in the game, one of seven games in which he captured 10 or more wickets. In addition, he scored his highest aggregate of runs, accumulating 855 runs at an average of 31.66; at one point, Verity led the Yorkshire batting averages.Hill, p. 109. Playing for his county against the Indian touring team, Verity achieved his highest first-class innings in England with 96 not out. He played in all three Test matches against India, a team which failed to live up to expectations and suffered internal divisions. G. O. B. \\"Gubby\\" Allen, the England captain, won the toss in the first Test and bowled first on the advice of Verity, but the latter was less successful than expected and Allen later described this as one of the few occasions he saw him bowl poorly.Hill, p. 121. India established a first innings lead, but were bowled out for 93 in their second innings and easily lost the match; Verity took four for 17.Hill, p. 122. The second Test was a draw in which he took four for 41 in the first innings and scored 66, his highest Test score. England won the final Test to take the series 1‚Äì0; Verity took four wickets in the game. In the series he took 15 wickets at an average of 15.20, finishing top of the England bowling averages.Hill, p. 185. He also appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen and in a Test trial for the North against the South. Regarded as a certainty to tour Australia during the 1936‚Äì37, Verity was among the first seven players selected and his name was announced before the second Test against India. =Second tour to Australia= Under the captaincy of Allen,Hill, p. 113. Verity began the tour well. He took 16 wickets before the Tests began with best figures of five for 50 against Queensland, his only five wicket haul of the Australian leg of the tour. England won the first two Tests of the series, assisted by poor weather which altered pitch conditions in their favour. In the first match, England scored 358 and bowled Australia out for 234. Although Verity took just one wicket, Wisden's correspondent praised him, reporting: \\"Among the bowlers ... Verity must not be forgotten. In the first innings he bowled in his best form and contributed to many of [Bill] Voce's wickets ... So difficult was Verity to score from that batsmen in desperation tried to get runs off Voce, with disastrous results to themselves.\\" After England set Australia 381 to win, rain damaged the pitch; Allen and Voce bowled the home team out for 58. In the second Test, England won by an innings, again assisted by rain. Verity took three wickets in the match, including that of Bradman.Hill, p. 114. The turning point of the series was the third Test. On the first day, Verity again dismissed Bradman and the England bowlers performed well in good batting conditions before rain altered the state of the pitch. Australia declared their innings closed at 200 for nine and after losing nine wickets for 76, England also declared, hoping to make Australia bat on a still-difficult pitch.Hill, p. 112. In much easier batting conditions, Australia made 564, of which Bradman scored 270. Verity bowled nearly 38 eight-ball overs and took three for 79. Cardus wrote: \\"Verity was magnificent ... In his absence Bradman might have scored another 100 runs. Nothing but consummate length and flight could have checked Bradman, in circumstances made for Bradman ... Every run from Verity had to be earnt. It was beautiful bowling, delightful to the eye and intellect.\\"Hill, pp. 112‚Äì13. Wisden's report said: \\"Voce and Verity were outstanding England bowlers. The latter kept an immaculate length and allowed no batsman to take liberties with him.\\" England were bowled out for 323 and lost the game. In an attempt to solve their problem in finding a reliable opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53 runs together, England's best opening partnership of the series. Wisden praised Verity's defence but said he had not solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett. England scored 330 but Australia's second innings of 433 left England needing 392. Barnett and Verity began with a stand of 45, but England lost by 148 runs. In two innings, Verity scored 19 and 17, but was wicketless in the match. Having levelled the series, Australia won the final match by a large margin to take the series 3‚Äì2. Verity took just one wicket in the match. In the series, he took 10 wickets at an average of 45.50; in all first-class matches in Australia, he captured 28 wickets at 30.75 and secured 10 wickets at 18.20 in two matches in New Zealand at the end of the tour. The Wisden report on the tour said: \\"Verity admirably performed the task of keeping one end closed and took high honours for his consistently good work.\\" The Times correspondent, noting the failure of the wrist spinners selected to tour, wrote: \\"Australia ... beat us because they have spin bowlers who make the ball truly spin. Verity certainly never had a wicket on which to demonstrate his art, so exposing the fact that real spin bowling does not at the moment exist in England.\\" During the 1937 season, Verity played only one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and although batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages. =Ashes series of 1938= Verity took 158 first- class wickets in 1938 at an average of 15.38, placing him third once more in the national averages; Bowes was second in the list and Yorkshire retained the Championship. After appearing in a trial match, Verity played in all four Tests against Australia, during a series which was tied 1‚Äì1. In the first match, England scored 658 and according to Wisden, the new England captain Wally Hammond decided to keep Verity in reserve in the expectation of making Australia follow-on; he bowled just 45 balls in Australia's first innings. Australia did follow-on, and in the second innings, Verity bowled 62 overs to take three wickets for 102, bowling very accurately, but the batsmen played him skilfully and the match was drawn. In the second match, Verity took four for 103 out of an Australian total of 422, in reply to England's 494\\\\. After Verity had taken two wickets in eight balls, Australia were in danger of having to follow-on, but Bill O'Reilly struck him for two consecutive sixes to remove the possibility. Verity took two wickets in the second innings, but the match was drawn. After the third match was abandoned owing to rain, Australia won the fourth Test, held at Headingley, by five wickets to ensure the Ashes were retained. Wisden commented that: \\"At no time was the wicket easy for batting and Australia won largely because they possessed better spin bowling.\\" Verity took two wickets in the match, but some critics believed his bowling could have won the match had Hammond used him more effectively. In a match where the Australian spinner O'Reilly took 10 wickets, Hammond used his fast bowlers Bowes and Ken Farnes for the majority of both innings. Commentators believed Hammond over-used his fast bowlers; Cardus wrote: \\"Hammond's faith in fast bowling rather exceeded his faith in the arts of Verity and Wright. The result was sad disillusionment.\\" Barnett also said that Hammond refused to allow Verity to alter his bowling tactics, when the Yorkshire bowler wished to aim for a worn area on the pitch.Hill, p. 116. As neither side had established a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, no matter how long it took. England scored a record team total of 903 runs and Australia were heavily defeated. Verity, one of five Yorkshire players in the team, bowled 12 overs in the game and took two wickets. He also played a part in the achievement of Len Hutton, who scored 364 runs, breaking the record for the highest individual innings in a Test match. As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: \\"I owe [Verity] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay ... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout those long hours\\".Hill, p. 98. The series was drawn; Verity took 14 wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes.Hill, p. 182. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests.Hill, p. 115. Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's team which defeated the tourists by 10 wickets. =Tour to South Africa and final season= In the winter of 1938‚Äì39, Verity toured South Africa with the MCC team under Hammond's captaincy.Hill, pp. 125‚Äì26. He took 47 wickets at 19.93 in first-class games. In the first game of the tour, Verity took 11 wickets against Griqualand West. In the Test matches, the batsmen played in a negative fashion, despite pitches that were very good for batting. High scoring games left the bowlers with expensive figures and Verity had the best bowling average on either side, bowling accurately and reliably. He played in all five Test matches, taking 19 wickets at 29.05. The first two matches were drawn: in the first innings of the opening Test, he took four for 61 in 44 eight-ball overs; in the first innings of the second Test, he took five for 70 in nearly 37 overs. England won the third match, the only result in the series and the fourth was also drawn. The final game was to be played without a time limit until there was a winner; after 10 days it had to be abandoned as the MCC had to catch a boat home. The match established a record at the time for the total number of runs scored in a first-class game, as both teams combined to post an aggregate of 1,981 runs. Verity took four wickets and bowled 766 balls in the game, establishing a new record for deliveries in a first-class game. It proved difficult to score runs from Verity's bowling but the batsmen generally were very cautious. Verity's final first-class cricket came in the 1939 season which was overshadowed by the forthcoming war.Hill, pp. 126‚Äì28. Yorkshire won their third successive County Championship and the seventh of Verity's career. Verity took 191 wickets at an average of 13.13, to top the bowling averages for the second time in his career. Verity's only representative cricket came in the first Test match against West Indies, when he took two wickets in the match. He was subsequently left out of the team for the second Test in favour of Tom Goddard, and did not play any more Test matches. However, Wisden's report on the third Test commented that his absence and that of several other bowlers left the English attack weaker. In a career total of 40 Tests, Verity took 144 wickets at an average of 24.37 and scored 669 runs at an average of 20.90. With much of the end of the cricket season abandoned prior to the expected outbreak of war, Verity played his last match against Sussex. In the second innings, Verity took seven wickets for nine runs on a rain-affected pitch to bowl Sussex out for 33 and take Yorkshire to a win, although the match was played in a strained, tense atmosphere.Hill, pp. 129‚Äì31. This was Verity's last performance in first-class cricket. In total, he had taken 1,956 wickets at an average of 14.90 and scored 5,603 runs at 18.07. Style and technique As a bowler, Verity delivered the ball at almost medium pace, faster than usual for a spinner.Hill, p. 158. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, a cricket writer and journalist, wrote \\"He is a scholarly bowler ... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that you would expect from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can't explain.\\"Robertson- Glasgow, p. 80. His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply. His most effective delivery curved through the air, pitched on middle and leg stump and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge the ball into the slips.Hill, pp. 157‚Äì58. On rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 79. However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated. In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets. Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.Hill, p. 161. Verity never spun the ball very far, particularly after his second tour to Australia, and preferred to concentrate on bowling a good length.HIll, pp. 160‚Äì61. However, critics did not think that Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch.Hill, p. 159. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: \\"Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket.\\"Hill, p. 110. At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.Hill, pp. 98‚Äì99.Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 80‚Äì81. alt=Man in double breasted suit, posing with a cricket bat. Verity earned the respect of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he \\"grew more and more to respect [Verity] both as a gentleman and as a player.\\"Writing in the foreword to Hill's book. Hill, p. 7. Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was \\"one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms\\". During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: \\"I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there's no breaking-point with him.\\" Verity is often cited as one of the greatest slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: \\"We can only say that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind.\\" The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but \\"as a workman-artist, he will take some beating.\\" Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners,Hill, p. 167. and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against.Hill, p. 168. Bradman wrote: \\"Undoubtedly he was one of the greatest slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity's equal and of the Englishmen I saw ... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others.\\"Hill, p. 169. As a batsman, Verity occasionally showed potential to become good, but concentrated his energy on bowling. He modelled his batting on Herbert Sutcliffe, and Robertson-Glasgow wrote: \\"As a batsman, he looks like Sutcliffe gone stale. That is, pretty good.\\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 81. Military service =Training with the Green Howards= Since around 1937, Verity had expected the outbreak of the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature.Hill, pp. 133‚Äì34. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry.Bowes, pp. 132‚Äì33.Hill, p. 134. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following a spell at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1st Battalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits.Hill, pp. 134‚Äì35. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training.Hill, p. 137. Verity's Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's.Hill, pp. 136‚Äì40. In August, he returned to England and after a spell in London, he was posted overseas.Hill, pp. 140‚Äì41. The 1st battalion of the Green Howards transferred early in 1942 to Ranchi in India, where the climate badly affected Verity's health. After suffering from dysentery, he was weak and his doctors wished to send him home. However, he resumed his position and, by the end of the year, his battalion was sent to Persia. In March 1943, the battalion was posted to Kibrit Air Base in Egypt for training and then to Qatana in Syria. Here, preparations were finalised for the Allied invasion of Sicily.Hill, pp. 143‚Äì44. Verity remained below peak fitness and was struggling a little owing to his age. His commanding officers planned to withdraw him from front-line fighting and move him to a staff position at headquarters once the Sicily campaign had concluded. =Death= The invasion of Sicily was initially successful until the Allied forces reached the plains outside Catania, where German forces put up strong resistance. The Green Howards, as part of the 15th Brigade, made a night attack on 19 July. However, conditions were more difficult than expected and the brigade came under heavy fire.Hill, pp. 146‚Äì47. Verity commanded B Company, which was surrounded in the confusion. Attempting to secure the position, Verity was hit in the chest by shrapnel and had to be left behind as the company retreated. The last order he gave was \\"keep going\\". Severely wounded and subsequently captured by the Germans, Verity was taken to a field hospital and underwent an operation.Hill, p. 148. Taken by boat across the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, Verity first went to a hospital in Reggio Calabria and was then transported for two days by train to Naples. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at Caserta. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31 July, and was buried with full military honours.Hill, pp. 151‚Äì52. His grave was later moved from the town's cemetery to the military cemetery established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.Hill, pp. 152‚Äì53. Bradman wrote in an obituary: \\"I cannot ever recall hearing Verity utter a word of complaint or criticism ... if reports of his final sacrifice be correct ... he maintained this example right to the end.\\" When first-class cricket resumed in 1945, Yorkshire staged a memorial match for Verity against Lancashire at Bradford Park Avenue, which resulted in a draw. Later, several Yorkshire players visited his grave; some members of the MCC team under Len Hutton's captaincy in 1954‚Äì55, including Hutton, journalists and former Yorkshire player Abe Waddington paid tribute there while en route for Australia.Hill, p. 153. Personal life Verity married Kathleen Alice Metcalfe, a bookbinder and the daughter of a sales agent, on 7 March 1929. The two had known each other as children in Headingley and met again at a Rawdon youth club social event.Hill, p. 38. They had two sons, first Wilfred, named after Wilfred Rhodes,Hill, photographic plate 3. and then George Douglas, named after George Hirst and Douglas Jardine. Shortly before the outbreak of the war, Kathleen Verity began to suffer from poor health, and the family planned a trip to South Africa in the English winter of 1939 to aid her recovery and so Verity could take up one of several offers of a coaching job. In the last months before Hedley Verity went overseas during the war, Kathleen joined him in Omagh and later in London just before he went away. The Hedley Verity, a branch of Wetherspoons in Leeds city centre, is named after Verity and there is a Blue Plaque on the house he was born in.

Life Albert III was born in the ducal residence of Vienna, the third son of the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria and his wife Joanna of Pfirt. Even though his father had determined a house law, whereby the four sons were obliged to rule jointly and equally, the eldest brother Rudolf IV assumed the reins of government after his father's death in 1358. He reaffirmed his supremacy issuing the Privilegium Maius. However, as his marriage remained childless he again had to share his power with his younger brothers. In 1365 Rudolf IV, Albert III, and Leopold III together signed the foundation certificate of the Vienna University (Alma Mater Rudolphina Vindobonensis); Rudolf died a few months later at the age of 25. =Divided rule= Albert, then the eldest surviving brother (the second- born son Frederick III had already died in 1362), inherited the rule and shared it with his younger brother Leopold III. Both were formally enfeoffed with the Duchy of Austria, Duchy of Styria, Duchy of Carinthia, and Duchy of Carniola by Emperor Charles IV. In 1369 the Habsburg dukes succeeded the late Meinhard III, Count of Gorizia-Tyrol in the County of Tyrol, when after a drawn-out conflict the Wittelsbach Duke Stephen II of Bavaria finally renounced his rights. In 1368 the Habsburg brothers purchased the Swabian city of Freiburg. But their attempt to gain control over the Adriatic port of Trieste failed in an armed conflict with the Republic of Venice in 1369/70. Trieste was not won until 1382, when the citizens sought protection from Venice by subjecting themselves to Austrian rule. In 1374 the Austrian dukes inherited large territories in the Windic March and Istria from the late Albert III, Count of Gorizia, which they attached to the Duchy of Carniola. The next year they acquired the Swabian lordship of Feldkirch from the Counts of Montfort, the nucleus of the Habsburg possessions in later Vorarlberg. Tension developed between the brothers, and in 1379 Albert and Leopold, by the Treaty of Neuberg divided the extended Habsburg territories. Albert received Austria proper (Austria Inferior), while Leopold get Styria, Carinthia and Carniola (Austria Interior), Tyrol (Austria Superior) and the dynasty's original possessions in Swabia (Austria Anterior). The division of the Habsburgs into the Albertinian Line and Leopoldian line was a significant disadvantage in competition with the rival Wittelsbach and Luxembourg dynasties. It persisted until 1490, when Archduke Sigismund of Tyrol and Further Austria handed over his estates to his cousin King Maximilian I. =Politics= In 1377, Albert went on a crusade in Prussia against pagan Baltic Lithuanian and Samogitian tribes. Meanwhile, the expansion of the Habsburg dukes in Swabia collided with the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy and sparked armed revolts. In 1386 Duke Leopold III and numerous Austrian nobles were killed in a disastrous defeat at the 1386 Battle of Sempach, whereafter Albert once again became sole ruler over the Albertinian and Leopoldian lands, acting as regent for his minor nephews. Another attempt to restore Habsburg rule in Swabia failed, when Albert's knights were again defeated by the Swiss pike squares in the 1388 Battle of N√§fels and the duke had to call for an armistice. Albert inaugurates the Collegium ducale (left), theological lecture (right), contemporary illumination In the Austrian lands, his government was beneficial to the realm, as he supported the arts and sciences. Albert was an apt scholar himself, particularly as a mathematician and astrologer. The eldest preserved book of the Austrian National Library, a 1386 Evangelion, comes from his personal property. The duke expanded the University of Vienna and, during the Western Schism, reached the consent of Pope Urban VI to establish a theological faculty. He continued the building of St. Stephen's Cathedral and attempted to refurbish Vienna modelled on Emperor Charles' residence in Prague. Albert's nickname refers to his particular hairstyle, part of the vestments of a short-lived chivalric order (Zopforden) he had established and which dissolved upon his death. By the end of his reign, Albert had established a firm princely rule over the Austrian duchy, stretching along the Danube from the Hungarian border on the Leitha River in the east to the Hausruck range in the west. In the conflict over the succession upon the death of Emperor Charles IV in 1378, Albert joined the forces of the Luxembourg heirs Jobst of Moravia and Sigismund against the incapable king Wenceslaus and seemed a likely candidate for the German throne himself. However, he died in August 1395 while staying in his Laxenburg hunting lodge, during the preparations of a military campaign to achieve Wenceslaus' deposition which took place in 1400. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom cathedral in Vienna. Family and children Albert and his wives Elisabeth (left) and Beatrix (right), Habsburg pedigree, 1497 Albert III was married twice. The first marriage, after 19 March 1366, was with Elisabeth of Bohemia, a daughter of the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV. This marriage was childless; his wife died at age fifteen. Afterwards, he married Beatrix of Nuremberg, a daughter of the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick V of Nuremberg and his wife Elisabeth of Meissen, a member of the House of Wettin and a descendant of the extinct Babenberg dukes of Austria. Beatrix gave him his only son, Albert IV, who succeeded him but soon had to cede the rule over the Inner Austrian, Tyrolean and Further Austrian possessions to his Leopoldian cousins William and Leopold IV. The Albertinian line became extinct with the death of Ladislaus the Posthumous in 1457.

In 1932, Dingell was elected as a Democrat from the newly formed 15th District in western Detroit. He was reelected eleven times and served until his death at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., at the age of 61. He is interred at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

Winslow played his entire NFL career from 1979 to 1987 with the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers) after being selected in the first round of the 1979 NFL Draft. He played college football for the University of Missouri, where he was a consensus All-American. He was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame (2002). Winslow is the former director of athletics at Florida A&M; University. He has previously held administrative roles at Central State University where he was athletic director, and the vice president for athletics and wellness at Lakeland College Early years Winslow attended East St. Louis Senior High School and did not play high school football until his senior year. Until then, he was a self-described \\"nerd\\" who played chess.Jaworski 2010, p.91 In college, Winslow played for the Missouri Tigers, and was a two-time all-conference selection in the Big Eight and a consensus All-American in 1978. He led the Big Eight in touchdown receptions in both 1977 and 1978, catching three and six respectively. He finished his college career with 71 receptions for 1,089 yards and 10 touchdowns and post college, was married and subsequently accused of spousal abuse on several occasions. Professional career Winslow was drafted in the first round of the 1979 NFL Draft by the Chargers, with the #13 pick. Winslow played for them his entire career, when he retired in 1987 due to injury. After a knee injury prematurely ended his rookie season, Winslow, as part of Air Coryell, led the NFL in receptions in 1980 and 1981, becoming the second tight end ever to lead the league in receptions in back to back seasons. His 89 catches in 1980 was an NFL record for tight ends, breaking the previous mark of 75 held by Mike Ditka. He also exceeded the 1,000 yards receiving milestone in 3 different seasons, including setting an NFL single season record for receiving yards by a tight end with 1,290 yards in the 1980 season. The record stood until Rob Gronkowski totaled 1,327 yards in 2011. In a 1981 regular season game, Winslow tied an NFL record by catching five touchdown passes. In a 1981‚Äì82 playoff game against the Miami Dolphins that became known as The Epic in Miami, Winslow caught a playoff record 13 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown, while also blocking a field goal with seconds remaining to send the game to overtime in one of the greatest single player efforts in NFL history. Winslow's yardage total stood as the playoff record for tight ends for 30 years until Vernon Davis's 180 yards in 2012. What made Winslow's performance all the more memorable was that fact during the game he was treated for a pinched nerve in his shoulder, dehydration, severe cramps, and received three stitches in his lower lip. After the game, a picture of Winslow being helped off the field by his teammates became an enduring image in NFL Lore. Tight ends prior to Winslow were primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive lineman and ran short to medium drag routes. Winslow was put in motion so he would not be jammed at the line, or he was lined up wide or in the slot against a smaller cornerback.Jaworski 2010, p.81. Former Chargers assistant coach Al Saunders said Winslow was \\"a wide receiver in an offensive lineman's body.\\" Chargers head coach Don Coryell said, \\"If we're asking Kellen to block a defensive end and not catch passes, I'm not a very good coach Back then, defenses would cover Winslow with a strong safety or a linebacker, as zone defenses were not as popular.Jaworski 2010, p.93 Strong safeties in those times were almost like another linebacker, a run defender who could not cover a tight end as fast as Winslow. Providing another defender to help the strong safety opened up other holes.Jaworski 2010, pp.93‚Äì94 Former head coach Jon Gruden called Winslow the first \\"joker\\" in the NFL. He would line up unpredictably in any formation from a three point blocking stance to a two point receiver's stance, to being in motion like a flanker or offensive back. Head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends who get paid the most money are \\"all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow\\" and that there are fewer tight ends now who can block on the line.Jaworski 2010, p.112 Winslow was off of to a record setting receiving pace in 1984 in term of receptions, accumulating 55 catches in only seven games. On October 23, 1984, in the Chargers's seventh game of season against the Los Angeles Raiders, having already caught 8 passes for 107 yards, Winslow suffered a severe right knee injury while making his 55th reception of the season. Winslow knee twisted while being tacked by Raiders linebacker Jeff Barnes. Dr. Gary Losse, who performed surgery on Winslow's knee for over two hours, later said that Winslow's knee looked like \\"spaghetti....like a couple of mop ends\\". Dr. Losse also said \\"The ligaments had almost an explosion-like appearance, it was a very, very severe knee injury.\\" url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/23/sports/injury-to-winslow-may-end- career.html Winslow came back the next year in the middle of the season, but was never again close to being the dominant player he had been. He retired after the 1987 season. Winslow played in five Pro Bowls, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002. In his nine NFL seasons, Winslow caught 541 passes for 6,741 yards and 45 touchdowns. Kellen was a consensus All-Pro in 1980, 1981, and 1982. He is also a member of the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. He was the San Diego Chargers' honorary captain at Super Bowl XXIX, and one of seven participants in the game's pregame coin toss, joining fellow 75th Anniversary Team members Otto Graham, Mean Joe Greene, Ray Nitschke, and Gale Sayers, as well as fellow PBHOF Class of 1995 members Steve Largent, then a U.S. Congressman, and Lee Roy Selmon. Winslow worked as a college football announcer with Fox Sports Net. In 2008, he was appointed the Athletic Director of Central State University in Ohio. In 1999, he was ranked number 73 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 greatest football players of all time. Personal life Winslow's son, Kellen Winslow II, is a convicted serial rapist, and also happened to play tight end in the NFL. Winslow II was drafted in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft from the Miami Hurricanes by the Cleveland Browns, the team the Chargers traded with to draft the elder Winslow in 1979.

Prior to its acquisition by Cemex, it was listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. The business was on-sold by Cemex to Holcim in 2009 and now operates under the banner of Holcim (Australia) Pty Ltd. Divisions Rinker operated three major divisions: * Readymix, which produced and delivered bulk concrete and quarried rock and sand for the building industry for the Australian market. Readymix had established subsidiaries in China, supplying concrete for the cities of Tianjin and Qingdao. * Humes, a manufacturer of concrete products including pipe, rail track materials, precast concrete bridges, culverts and the like, for the Australian market. Humes is still a major player in this market as a subsidiary of Holcim Australia.https://www.holcim.com.au/humes * Rinker Materials Corporation of West Palm Beach produces a number of concrete, aggregate and other heavy building products similar to the Australian product line in a number of US states, notably including Florida and Arizona. In Florida, for instance, it operated under the name \\"Florida Materials\\", and ran a substantial retail network for these materials and other building products. About 80% of Rinker's revenue and profits came from its US operations. History Rinker Group was established as a separate entity in 2003 through its demerger from CSR Limited. CSR had earlier purchased Rinker Materials, which was founded by Marshall \\"Doc\\" Rinker and A.V. Hansen in 1926. The company has approximately 14,000 employees and as of 2004 has sales of around US$3,700 million and a market capitalisation of about US$5 billion. Its net profit was US$492 million in the 2003-04 financial year. In the Companies Target Statement over Cemex's takeover bid they showed the groups result from 98 (they were at this time owned by Commonwealth Sugar Refineries). They revealed that the compound average growth rate for EBITDA is 24.8 while sales grew at 14.3% average compound. Taking these figures it's evident that in nine fiscal years their EBITDA margin has doubled from 14% to 28%. This means on average over the last 9 years 32.9% of any amount that sales grows by (14.3%) will result in 32.9% sales growth is directly translated into EBITDA. Rinker Group was acquired by CEMEX, the world's third largest cement producer, through its subsidiary CEMEX Australia Pty Ltd. in a US$14.2 billion takeover bid. As of June 2007 CEMEX owned a 67.3% stake in Rinker Group. The Chief Executive Officer was David Clarke, who had long worked in CSR's heavy building products division. The chairman of the board of directors was Hector Medina, executive vice-president of CEMEX. The other board members were also nominees from CEMEX. CEMEX Australia was sold to Holcim in June 2009 as part of a $2 billion AUD takeover bid, and is now known as Holcim Australia. The deal included the Readymix and Humes business units and CEMEX's 25% stake in Cement Australia (one of Australia's major cement manufacturers), but did not include the US-based Rinker Materials Corporation.https://www.smh.com.au/business/holcim-snaps-up-cemex-australia- for-2b-20090615-c8gh.html The company's corporate headquarters are located in Chatswood, a Sydney suburb.

It was produced by Lee Marvin's Latimer Productions and Revue Studios. Its main sponsor was the Pall Mall cigarette brand; Lee Marvin, the program's star, appeared in its commercials during many episodes. Alternate sponsors were General Electric (GE), Hazel Bishop and Bulova watches. Episodes Set in Chicago, Illinois, it starred Marvin as Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, a member of \\"M Squad\\", a special unit of the Chicago Police, assisting other units in battling organized crime, corruption and violent crimes citywide. Paul Newlan co-starred as his boss, Captain Grey. Although Marvin had been appearing in feature films since 1951, it was this series that made him a star, and he later went on to an even bigger film career afterward. Nelson Case was the announcer. The popularity of M Squad was proven in the ratings wars by the NBC network choosing a Friday night time slot opposite Frank Sinatra's ABC variety show in the fall of 1957 and Phil Silvers' long running CBS comedy, Sgt. Bilko, in 1958. Both series were eventually cancelled.

Wynant Music * The theme music for the first season was composed by Stanley Wilson, who won the 1959 Grammy Award for the Best Soundtrack Album and Background Score from Motion Picture or Television. In the second and third seasons, the new theme was composed by Count Basie. * A soundtrack album, Music from M Squad, with liner notes by Lee Marvin, was released by RCA Victor Records in 1959 during the last season of the show. Trivia * In episode \\"The Jumper\\", an officer was depicted taking bribes. This prompted Richard J. Daley, the Mayor of Chicago at the time, to discourage motion picture and television location filming in Chicago for the rest of his administration (1955-1976). The Blues Brothers, released in 1980, marked the reversal of the policy under then-mayor Jane Byrne. * The TV series Police Squad! was a spoof on police series in general, and on signature elements of M Squad in particular. The opening sequence of Police Squad! spoofed portions of the opening sequence of M Squad, particularly the theme song arrangement and the sequence with shots being fired from behind a car. As well, the Police Squad! office was designed to look very much like the M Squad office, and the narration in each series was very similar, with each character introducing himself in each episode as a \\"detective lieutenant\\". * Similarly, the 1994 music video directed by Spike Jonze for the song \\"Sabotage\\" by the Beastie Boys directly parodies the opening sequence of M Squad, amongst other police shows. * A novel was published in 1962, M Squad: The Chicago Cop Killer, by David Saunders. It was published by Belmont Books, New York. * Lee Marvin carried two Colt Cobra revolvers, the lightweight variant of Colt's \\"Detective's Special\\" revolver, which was popular with detectives at the time. Home media Timeless Media Group released M Squad: The Complete Series on DVD in the Region 1 on November 11, 2008. This release has been discontinued and is out of print.

It provided a percentile ranking of peer students of the same age. In NSW, the UAI was determined by a combination of the public HSC exams common across all schools at the end of Year 12 and continuing assessment. Assignments and exams in Year 11 served to prepare students for Year 12 but were not in any way involved in the calculation process. In the ACT, the UAI was determined by ongoing assignments and exams spanning through both Years 11 & 12\\\\. The ACT Scaling Test (AST), sat by tertiary students, linked a student's ability with the school's mean score in each course and was used to scale students in different courses and schools. UAI scores were not directly equivalent to a percentile rank among those who completed Year 12 (i.e. a UAI of 99 was not equivalent to placing in the top 1% of the state). The statistical distribution of UAI scores in 2004 found that 1.6% of students who completed Year 12 scored at or over a UAI of 99.Table A8 (pdf) UAIs are awarded in increments of 0.05. The UAI's predecessor, the Tertiary Entrance Rank, was different because it defined the student population as only students in year 12. The UAI attempted to rank students who did not progress to their senior years of High School, by estimating what they would have got. This keeps the rank consistent throughout the years despite fluctuating Year 10 drop-out rates as the rank was always measured relative to a Year 10 cohort, with the ranks of the drop-outs being estimated. A student's UAI was given as a number between 30 and 100. Students who receive 30 or below receive a 'pink slip' which informed them that they received below 30, though these were rare due to most of the estimated Year 10 cohort's marks falling into this range. UAIs of 100 were extremely rare and were only achieved by a few students (generally, about 20 out of almost 66,000) every year. The organisation responsible for administering the UAI, was the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC), who scaled all subjects using mathematical formulae to try to ensure equity of marks across subjects. To be eligible for the UAI as well as the HSC or ACT Year 12 Certificate, a student must have complied with additional rules set by the Board of Studies in New South Wales or the Board of Senior Secondary Studies in the Australian Capital Territory. Calculation in NSW To calculate the UAI, the UAC used the raw exam marks of the HSC and the moderated assessment mark. The assessment mark was obtained from the internal school examinations a student sat over the last term of Year 11 and the three terms of Year 12. The school marks were sent to the UAC from the Board of Studies, and from these students were ranked from first to last. The student ranked first was then assigned a moderated assessment mark equal to the highest examination mark scored by that group of students, regardless of who scored it, and similarly the student ranked last would receive the lowest examination mark. The rest of the students had their assessment marks moderated between these two values, with the proportional difference between the marks remaining the same (for instance, the gap of 10 between two marks spread over a range of 20% would be halved if the range was further halved to 10%). The student who came first in the subject was then assigned the maximum mark, normally 50.0 on a one unit basis but may have changed with scaling. Following that all students who sat the course had a scaled mark calculated based on an estimate of what each student would have achieved had they sat that course. This was repeated for all of a student's units. The student's two best English units were added along with their next best eight units, which may have included further English units, to give an aggregate mark, out of 500.0. Students were then ranked - however, this rank did not translate directly to the UAI. The distribution of students was uneven. Ranking scaled upwards - only 29.3% of students would receive a UAI of under 50, and the median UAI was around 65, a statistical trend which was applicable at every UAI level. This was because the spread of marks took into account those who did not complete their HSC or otherwise attend the post- compulsory years of education. Their hypothetical marks were determined by the School Certificate, one compulsory for all students in NSW. As their marks were generally lower than those who complete the HSC, they caused the uneven spread across the spectrum of the UAI. Hypothetically, assuming that everyone continued to complete the HSC, the spread would have been completely even. However, NSW retention rates for students stood at around 70%, and there were students who completed the final years without gaining an HSC. Students who finish high school overseas Students who finished high school overseas and who had a qualification such as the SAT, International Baccalaureate or A Levels may have had their score converted to a UAI. Also, a number of international schools had adopted the ACT curriculum and assessment regime such that their studies culminated in the award of an ACT-calculated UAI. Australian Tertiary Admission Rank During June 2009, the Federal Minister for Education announced the removal of UAI and the introduction of the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, or ATAR, for Year 12 students of 2009 within the ACT and New South Wales, and for the rest of the country excluding Queensland in 2010.ACT adopts national student ranking system - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) The ATAR was introduced as an attempt to unify the university entrance system in Australia, where previously each state had its own individual system (e.g. UAI in ACT/NSW, TER in SA/NT, ENTER in Victoria). The shift to ATAR means that the scores for most students receiving a UAI would increase by a small amount (although this would not present as any advantage as score cutoffs would subsequently increase), while the maximum score would change from a UAI of 100 to an ATAR of 99.95.Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) - UAC Queensland will not shift to the ATAR system, due to a completely separate system and scoring scale.

History In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrant Yoshio Mayumi and his brother Yasuo settled in Fannett, purchasing 1734 acres (7 km¬≤) of land. The two brought with them techniques for rice farming, which became the dominant agricultural activity of Jefferson County. According to local tradition, in 1905 area residents collaborated to build a road to the Mayumi farm, and named the road \\"Jap Road\\" in their honor. In 1924, Mayumi returned to Japan. Low rice prices and smaller harvests due to mismanaged land had rendered his farm unprofitable. The Immigration Act of 1924 and related anti-immigrant sentiment are also considered contributing factors to Mayumi's decision to leave the country. Controversy Although Jap Road was named to honor its Japanese residents, by the end of the 20th century its name had taken on a new meaning. During World War II, \\"Jap\\" went from being an abbreviation for \\"Japanese\\" to an ethnic slur. In 1993, advocacy groups, led by Beaumont teacher Sandra Nakata, began pressuring the Jefferson County commissioners to change the name. The county commissioners responded by stating that \\"Jap Road\\" was not an ethnic slur and honored the road's original Japanese residents. They did, however, give the road's residents the chance to change the name if they so chose. Area residents, including descendants of the Japanese settlers, were highly resistant to any name change. Further efforts in 1999 also met with no success. In 2004, the Japanese American Citizens League and the Anti-Defamation League filed complaints with the US Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Finally bowing to outside pressure, the Jefferson County commissioners ordered Jap Road's residents to select a new name by July 29, 2004. They chose opposition leaders Wayne Wright and Earl Callahan to oversee the selection. The options presented to the road's residents included \\"Mayumi Road', \\"Japanese Road\\", \\"Japan Road\\", and \\"Boondocks Road\\". Out of 170 voting residents, over 100 chose \\"Boondocks Road\\". The Boondocks was a popular catfish restaurant that had closed a decade earlier. Anger at outside groups characterizing them as racists is the common explanation for residents' decision to entirely avoid using any of the Japanese-related names.

It was created by Denne Bart Petitclerc, and produced by MGM Television. Then Came Bronson began with a television film pilot that aired on NBC on March 24, 1969; the pilot was also released in Europe as a theatrical feature film. This was followed by a single season of 26 episodes airing between September 17, 1969 and April 1, 1970. Overview The series features Parks as the protagonist, James \\"Jim\\" Bronson, a newspaperman who becomes disillusioned after the suicide of his best friend Nick (Martin Sheen), and with \\"working for The Man\\" after a heated argument with his editor. In order to renew his soul Bronson becomes a vagabond searching for the meaning of life and seeking experiences that life has to offer (as revealed in the series pilot). During his travels, he shares his values with the people he meets along the way and to whom he lends a helping hand when possible. Bronson rides a Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle and, as such, he was viewed by some as a modern version of the solitary cowboy wandering the American west. The motorcycle had previously been sold to Nick by Bronson. After it is left at the scene of the suicide by his friend, Bronson buys it back from the widow. Curiously, though the opening promises a journey of self-discovery, the premise of each episode is that Bronson enters someone else's life at a crucial point and acts as a catalyst for change. When Bronson encounters an Amish community, for example, a local boy becomes enraptured by the outside world and steals Bronson's motorcycle to run off to Reno, Nevada. In another episode, located in Reno, Nevada, Bronson meets his cousin Eve on her wedding day and lends her money for the wedding service, but she runs off to the casinos and gambles it away. The first three episodes, including the end credits scenes, were shot in and around Jackson, Wyoming. The premier pilot film was also shown at the town's (then) only theater to give the locals a sense of what the series was going to be about, since they were shooting in town and at popular local area locations. Bronson is committed to pacifism and often redirects an antagonist's anger into self- examination. Always, like a true catalyst, Bronson rolls out of every episode unchanged. The show had obvious similarities to the early 1960s series Route 66; Michael Parks guest-starred in one episode of that series. It was also sometimes erroneously described as a knock-off of Easy Rider. =Series opening= Then Came Bronson Pilot The opening of the show served as a metaphor for the premise of the show: getting away from the \\"big city\\" and leading a simpler life. The opening begins with Bronson riding up to a red light in San Francisco and he briefly chats with a commuter. The scene also introduces Bronson's signature-phrase, which he often used in the episodes, \\"Hang in there\\". :Driver: \\"Taking a trip?\\" :Bronson: \\"What's that?\\" :Driver: \\"Taking a trip?\\" :Bronson: \\"Yeah.\\" :Driver: \\"Where to?\\" :Bronson: \\"Oh, I don't know. Wherever I end up, I guess.\\" :Driver: \\"Man, I wish I was you.\\" :Bronson: \\"Really?\\" :Driver: \\"Yeah.\\" :Bronson: \\"Well, hang in there.\\" From here he heads out to California's State Route 1 and then crosses over the Bixby Creek Bridge. Cast Michael Parks, who starred as James Bronson, had acted on television and starred in three anti-establishment films, Wild Seed, The Happening, and Bus Riley's Back in Town. He went on to have a steady career in drive-in horror movies and TV shows. Also a talented singer, Parks recorded three pop/jazz albums: Long Lonesome Highway, Closing the Gap, Blue, and several gospel albums. Long Lonesome Highway and Closing the Gap were connected with particular strength to Then Came Bronson. Parks performed the former's title selection over the closing credits of each episode, and it and the latter both featured other music from the series. (See below.) =Guest stars= Actors James Doohan (\\"Scotty\\") and Meg Wyllie, who appeared in guest roles, had previously worked on the original Star Trek series. Production The series was filmed and broadcast in color. =The motorcycle= Bronson's motorcycle, a 1969 XLH 900cc Harley-Davidson Sportster, figures in many episodes. In one episode he enters several motorcycle races; in another, he makes an emergency run to fetch a doctor, but in some stories, the motorcycle serves merely as his transportation. The fuel tank is illustrated with the Eye of Providence. =Crew= Several of Bronsons production staff and cast members had previously worked on the original Star Trek series, including executive producer Herbert F. Solow and producer Robert H. Justman, and writers D. C. Fontana and Robert Sabaroff. The series is also notable for providing the first television script credit for writer-producer Susan Harris, who went on to create Soap and The Golden Girls. =Music= The opening instrumental theme song was titled \\"Then Came Bronson\\" and was composed and conducted by George Duning. The closing vocal theme for the series, titled \\"Long Lonesome Highway\\", was sung by Parks and written and composed by James Hendricks; it was a Billboard Magazine Hot 100 hit that reached #20 in 1970. On March 25, 1970, Parks guest-starred on \\"The Johnny Cash Show\\". Cash introduced Parks as Bronson, saying, \\"And then Bronson came back to Tennessee\\". Parks sang his hit song from the show and then he and Johnny did a duet of Woody Guthrie's \\"Oklahoma Hills\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1094843/ Parks released two albums on the MGM label that featured music from this series, Closing the Gap (1969), and Long Lonesome Highway (1970). In addition, other artists such as John Bahler, Kiel Martin, Gary Jayson, Buffy Sainte- Marie, and Tom Paxton sang songs that appeared in the series. Actress Bonnie Bedelia in the pilot sang gospel song \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" with Parks. A version of \\"San Antonio Rose\\", sung by Parks, appears on the Rhino CD Golden Throats 3: Sweethearts of Rodeo Drive. In 2010, Duning's score for the pilot and two episode scores by Gil Mell√© were released as part of Film Score Monthly's TV Omnibus: Volume One (1962-1976). In 2013 Intrada Records released a two-disc set of music from the series, featuring Duning's six episode scores on disc one and selections from the other scores on disc two by John Parker, Elliot Kaplan, Stu Phillips, Dean Elliott, Richard Shores, Tom McIntosh, and Philip Springer.

It rises in the Mantiqueira Mountains in the state of Minas Gerais and descends inland, west-northwestward. Its lower course marks a portion of the Minas Gerais-S√£o Paulo border. At the Mato Grosso do Sul state border, after a course of , it joins the Parana√≠ba River to form the Upper Paran√° River. Major tributaries of the Rio Grande are: * Rio Aiuruoca, whose source is in Itamonte; * Rio das Mortes, whose source lies between Barbacena and Senhora dos Rem√©dios; * Rio Jacar√©, whose source is in the Serra do Galba; * Rio Sapuca√≠, whose source is in the Mantiqueira Mountains in S√£o Paulo; * Rio Pardo, whose source is in Ipui√∫na.

The basin of the Rio Grande is responsible for about 67% of all energy generated in the state. The Grande is interrupted by several dams and reservoirs; in the upper Grande the river forms Furnas Dam, then Peixotos Dam, and downstream, Luiz Barreto Dam, Jaguara Dam, Volta Grande Dam, Marimbondo Dam and √Ågua Vermelha Dam. The river plays a major role in production of electricity and, due to rapids and waterfalls, and absence of locks, is only navigable by small craft in limited stretches.

The EFOM met the Rio Grande at Ribeir√£o Vermelho, from where the service ran down the river for , as far as Capetina. There were six stations on the river between Ribeir√£o Vermelho and Capetinga, and the railway operated a fleet of 6 stern-wheel paddle steamers, together with barges and launches.

It was published in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Because of the complexity of its form and content, it is usually not read in German schools, although the first part commonly is. Only part of Faust I is directly related to the legend of Johann Faust, which dates to at latest the beginning of the 16th century (thus preceding Marlowe's play). The \\"Gretchen\\" subplot, although now the most widely known episode of the Faust legend, was of Goethe's own invention. In Faust II, the legend (at least in a version of the 18th century, which came to Goethe's attention) already contained Faust's marriage with Helen and an encounter with an Emperor. But certainly Goethe deals with the legendary material very freely in both parts. Acts =Act I= * Graceful area. Faust, bedded on flowery turf, weary, restless, seeking sleep. Dusk. Ghost circle, floating moves, graceful little figures. The first act opens with an appeal by Ariel to forgive Faust and ease the cares of his suffering. * Hall of the Throne. State Council in anticipation of the emperor. Trumpets. Servants of all kinds, beautifully dressed, step forward. The emperor ascends the throne, to his right the astrologer. The first act sees Mephistopheles (playing the role of a fool) saving the imperial finances of the Emperor ‚Äì and so the Holy Roman Empire ‚Äì by introducing the use of paper money instead of gold to encourage spending (and economic recovery). * Spacious room with side chambers, decorated and dressed up for the masquerade. This is by far the most extensive section of the first act, describing the Florentine carnival from the perspective of Goethe, above all based on Antonio Francesco Grazzini's Tutti i trionfi (1559) ‚Äì a collection of contemporary \\"songs and hard lifts\\". A parade of Florentine notables, including Dante and Gianni Schicchi, pass by. * Lustgarten, morning sun. Faust, Mephistopheles, decent, not remarkable, according to custom, dressed, and both knees exposed. The \\"Emperor of Thumb\\" (to use a devilish term of Mephistopheles) describes how much he enjoyed the recent celebrations, and wants more \\"dergleichen Scherze\\" (5988). The Emperor appears and blesses the newly introduced paper money from Mephisto, which is adorned with pictures of Simon Magus. The Emperor begins to understand its meaning and to squander it, as do his advisors. Goethe here satirizes the introduction of paper money during the French Revolution, with various advisors possibly representing Danton, Siey√®s and other figures. * Dark gallery. Faust. Mephistopheles. Faust enters the \\"realm of the mothers\\" ‚Äì variously described as the depths of the psyche or the womb ‚Äì in order to bring back the \\"ideal form\\" of beauty for the Emperor's delight. In this case, the ideal forms are Helen of Troy and her lover Paris. Faust summons their spirits from Hades, but the emperor and the male members of his court criticize Paris's appearance, while the women of the court criticize Helen's appearance. Faust falls in love with Helen. In a fit of jealously toward Paris, who is now abducting Helen, Faust destroys the illusion and the act ends in darkness and tumult. =Act II= Mephistopheles transports the unconscious Faust into his old study. Mephistopheles, donning Faust's robe once again, resumes his conversation with the freshman, who is now a cynical baccalaurus. The Homunculus, an artificial human being created by Wagner, Faust's former famulus, by means of an alchemical process, leads Faust and Mephistopheles to the \\"Classical Walpurgisnacht\\", where they encounter gods and monsters from Greek antiquity. Faust, still searching for Helen, is led by the sybil Manto into the Underworld. Mephistopheles, meanwhile, meets the Phorkyads or Phorcydes (another name for the Graeae) three hideous hags who share one tooth and one eye between them, and he disguises himself as one of them. Guided by the sea-god Proteus, the Homunculus is initiated into the process of becoming fully human, but his glass flask shatters, and he dies. =Act III= The third act begins with Helen's arrival at the palace of Menelaus in Sparta, accompanied by women, who, as in Classical drama, constitute the chorus. The hideous Phorkyas appears at the hearth, and warns Helen that Menelaus means to sacrifice her and her attendants. Distraught at this new knowledge, Helen implores Phorkyas to save them. Phorkyas transports Helen and the chorus to Faust's fortress, where Helen and Faust declare their love for each other. After defeating Menelaus' army, Faust proclaims the pastoral beauty of the Arcadian countryside. The scene changes in time and space: a range of rocky caverns, with a shadowy grove extending to the foot of the rocks. Phorkyas, now Faust and Helen's attendant, explains to the newly- woken chorus that during the past interval Faust and Helen have had a spirited son named Euphorion, who charms all with his beauty and gift for music. The wild Euphorion, becoming increasingly bold in his flight, falls to his death (in allusion to Icarus), whereupon the sorrowful Helen disappears in a mist to Hades (in allusion to the legend of Orpheus). The chorus of women, undesirous of joining their mistress in the Underworld, revert to nature, which they extol in songs of praise. As the act ends, Phorkyas is revealed to be Mephistopheles in disguise. =Act IV= In the fourth act, Faust finds himself taken away from Arcadia to a mountain top in Germany. Watching a cloud, that is separating into two parts, he recognizes in one part Helen and in the other Gretchen. The cloud with the form of Helen moves eastward, while the cloud of Gretchen rises heavenward. Then Mephistopheles, who has left behind his Greek appearance, joins Faust again. Mephistopheles strikes up a geognostic dispute about the genesis of terrestrial surface and especially the mountain region of this scene. Thereafter Faust states as his new higher purpose, that he wants to reclaim new land. Behind his desire stands the idea to control the elements or even to submit nature.\\"Zwecklose Kraft unb√§ndiger Elemente! / Da wagt mein Geist sich selbst zu √ºberfliegen, / Hier m√∂cht' ich k√§mpfen, die√ü m√∂cht' ich besiegen.\\" (10219‚Äì10221) Or: \\"If anything makes me despair, of my intent, / It's the aimless force of that wild element! / Then my spirit dared to soar high above: / Here I must fight, and this I must remove. / And it's possible! ‚Äì However tides may flow.\\" (10218‚Äì10222) Subsequently Faust focuses on controlling the sea, from which he reclaims new ground by dams and drainage ditches. But a war breaks out between the Emperor and a rival Emperor, whereby Faust's plans are interrupted. Mephistopheles introduces the three mighty men (German: ) consisting of Bullyboy, Grab-quick and Hold-tight (\\"Raufebold\\", \\"Habebald\\", \\"Haltefest\\"), that should help to oppress the revolt and implement Faust's ambitious project. With the assistance of the three mighty men Faust achieves the victory for the Emperor. The three mighty men reveal dubious behaviours as looters, that cast a long shadow over their future services. As a reward for his military service Faust gets a district at the beach to administer. =Act V= An indefinite interval of time has passed since the end of the previous act, and Faust is now an old but powerful man favored by the king. Using dikes and dams to push back the sea, Faust has built a castle on the reclaimed land. Upon seeing the hut of an old peasant couple (Baucis and Philemon) and a nearby chapel, Faust becomes irritated that these two structures do not belong to him, and orders to have them removed. Mephistopheles overinterprets Faust's orders by murdering the old couple. The personification of Care breathes upon Faust's eyes, and he becomes blind. Upon disclosing his plans to better the lives of his subjects, motivated perhaps out of guilt, he recognizes the moment of sheer bliss which he would seek to prolong and drops dead. Mephistopheles believes Faust has lost his wager and tries to claim his soul. Angels suddenly appear, dropping rose-petals on the demons, who flee from the burning petals. Mephistopheles, however, stands his ground, and, under the aphrodisiac influence of the roses, lusts after the angels, who meanwhile make off with Faust's soul. The scene abruptly changes to a wilderness inhabited by holy anchorites: \\"Mountain- gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert\\". Pater Profundus discloses the parable of nature, which is a harbinger of divine love. The angels bearing Faust's soul appear in heaven. After the enraptured Doctor Marianus extols the Eternal Feminine, the virgin Mary, Mater Gloriosa, appears from on high. Three biblical holy women, Magna Peccatrix (the Great Sinneress, Luke 7:36), Mulier Samaritana (the Samaritan woman, John 4), and Maria Aegyptiaca (Acta Sanctorum), plead for Faust's soul, while Una Paenitentium (previously Gretchen), also pleading for grace, offers to lead the reborn Faust into the higher spheres of heaven. Mater Gloriosa grants her wish. The Chorus Mysticus (mysticus = related to the mysteries) ends the drama: All of the transient, Is parable, only: The insufficient, Here, grows to reality: The indescribable, Here, is done: Woman, eternal, Beckons us on. In addition to the Christian motifs, the final scene makes references to an initiation into the ancient mysteries of Isis, in which the initiated learned the mysteries of the goddess Isis by the \\"epopteia\\".George Cebadal: Goethe, Schiller und die verschleierte Wahrheit. Ein kleiner Beitrag zur Mysterienkultur in Goethes \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung und der Weimarer Klassik. Norderstedt 2019. The \\"epopteia\\" is a nonverbal as well as \\"indescribable\\" (12108) process, that is associated with the sense of sight. Accordingly, Faust wants to see the mystery of Mater gloriosa: Mightiest empress of the world, Let me, in the blue Pavilion of the sky unfurl'd, Thy mystery view! H√∂chste Herrscherin der Welt! Lasse mich, im blauen, Ausgespannten Himmelszelt Dein Geheimni√ü schauen. (11997‚Äì12000) Moreover, Faust labels Mater gloriosa as \\"the heaven's Queen\\" (11995) and \\"goddess\\" (12100) like in Apuleius' \\"The Golden Ass\\" (an important text source for the contemporary access to ancient mysteriesJan Assmann, Florian Ebeling: √Ñgyptische Mysterien. Reisen in die Unterwelt in Aufkl√§rung und Romantik. p. 29.) the protagonist is invoking the goddess Isis by those titles.The protagonist starts his praying to the \\"Goddess\\" by calling her \\"Queen of Heaven\\". Apuleius: The Golden Ass, Book XI:1‚Äì4. See also: https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/TheGoldenAssXI.php While the title \\"goddess\\" forming a big contrast to Catholic and Protestant beliefs, Apuleius shows Isis as \\"mother of all Nature ... whose sole divinity is worshipped in differing forms, with varying rites, under many names, by all the world.\\"Apuleius: The Golden Ass, Book XI:5‚Äì6. See also: https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/TheGoldenAssXI.php. In the overall context of the story, this closing scene of initiation into the mysteries by Isis completes a series of motifs, that still starts in Faust I with Doctor Faust's first appearance. Here we see the popular motif of a veiled Isis, who was also identified as goddess and mother of nature: Mysterious, even in broad daylight, Nature won't let her veil be raised: What your spirit can't bring to sight, Won't by screws and levers be displayed. Geheimni√üvoll am lichten Tag L√§√üt sich Natur des Schleyers nicht berauben, Und was sie deinem Geist nicht offenbaren mag, Das zwingst du ihr nicht ab mit Hebeln und mit Schrauben.

Fair Head is regarded as one of the best outdoor rock-climbing locations in Ireland, and its long cliff, up to 100 metres high in places, is considered one of the biggest expanses of climbable rock in Northwest Europe. History and setting Fair Head's distinctive rock formations may be recorded in Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD), being described as a point called ·ø¨ŒøŒ≤œåŒ≥Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ (Robogdion) (cf the Pictish Robogdii tribe) which may refer to Fair Head. The name may derive from the Proto-Celtic root *bogd, \\"bend\\". The headland of Fair Head rises 196 metres above the sea. Wild goats can be seen roaming among the rocks beneath the clifftops, where a walkway called The Grey Man's Path winds around the rugged coastline. From the road, a man-made Iron Age island or crann√≥g can be seen in the middle of a lake, Lough na Cranagh. The lakes are stocked with trout and can be fished during the summer months. All of the land at Fair Head is private farmland, and not owned by National Trust. Access is by the goodwill of local farm owners. Fair Head is the closest headland to Rathlin Island. Many famous Irish artists have painted Fair Head, including Maurice Canning Wilks who painted a watercolour from a nearby beach. Rock climbing Climbers on the second pitch of Jolly Roger (grade E3/6a) at Fair Head. The single-pitch Fireball (grade E1/5b) at The Prow, Fair Head. Fair Head is regarded as one of Ireland's best outdoor rock climbing areas, along with the limestone sea-cliff of Ailladie in County Clare. It does not attract a high volume of rock climbers due to its relatively remote location, and the physical strength and unfamiliar climbing techniques it requires of climbers. Its cliffs stretch over 5 km around the headland, rising to a maximum height of over 100m. They are not sea-cliffs but have been described as a mountain crag by the sea, since they tower above an extensive boulder field and their isolation and size gives climbing there a big-wall mountaineering feel. The cliffs are composed of dolerite, giving a mixture of steep cracked walls, corners, and, in many places, sets of columns reminiscent of organ-pipes. The dolerite sits on top of a bed of chalk which is visible in places. The cliffs abound in well-protected steep crack climbing, between one and four pitches long. Many of the cracks involve hand- jamming, so some climbers tape their hands to protect the skin from what they term \\"Fair Head rash\\". Other climbs involve off-width or full-width chimneying, which is not often encountered in other Irish crags. As with nearly all Irish crags, only traditional protection (\\"clean climbing\\") is used. The 2014 Fair Head guidebook, its 6th edition, lists over 430 routes from under grade VS 4c up to E6 6b, but more recent climbing includes routes up to E8 6c. =Climbing history= The first climbs at Fair Head were done in the mid‚Äì1960s by some Belfast‚Äìbased climbers and members of the Dublin‚Äìbased Spillikin Club. Most of these climbs followed loose and dirty chimneys and are rarely repeated nowadays, but the seed had been planted, and before the end of the sixties development of the crag had started in earnest. However, it was not long before the increasing political violence in the North started making its presence felt; the Fair Head area was generally unaffected, but the development of the crag slowed to a trickle during the early 1970s. However the attractions of Fair Head eventually proved irresistible and development picked up again in the late seventies, led by the husband-and-wife team of Calvin Torrans and Clare Sheridan and a number of other Dublin climbers. This small band devoted themselves to developing Fair Head, founded the Dal Riada Climbing Club (named after the ancient kingdom which included this area), and acquired a climbing hut nearby to accommodate themselves and other visiting climbers. There is still unclimbed rock at Fair Head; opportunities, mainly in the higher grades, are waiting for those who have the talent and dedication. =Climbing layout= Layout of Fair Head climbs Complete Scream (E8 6c) cliff area The cliffs are divided into several main sectors. From east to west, these are: * The Small Crag, a 20m‚Äìhigh sector with 70 climbs stretches for 1 km above a heavily forested hillside; the difficulty of access means that abseiling in is usually required. Together with infestations of midges, this makes the sector unpopular, in spite of the quality of climbing to be had there. * The Main Crag (including The Prow at its western end), is by far the most important sector. It curves around the headland for 3 km, and contains the longest and best-quality climbs, up to 100m in height. Access is gained mainly by two easy descent gullies near either end of the sector, the Grey Man's Path at the east, and the Ballycastle Gully at the west. The Ballycastle Gully tends to be the more popular descent route for casual visitors, as there is a concentration of easier climbs in the vicinity. Between the two gullies, the starts of climbs can be reached by picking one's way through the boulder field or by doing a usually-vertical abseil of up to 100m. * Farrangandoo, this popular small sector consists of columns with intervening cracks every 2m or so and contains about 30 single-pitch climbs. * Marconi's Cove, is about 500m distant from the rest of the crag, and was not discovered until 1988, but contains about 25 good quality single-pitch climbs. * Complete Scream, is a cliff area with a route nearly 58 metres long at the British grade of E8 6b, which roughly translates to the mid-5.12 range. Complete Scream (E8 6b) was first climbed in 2005 by Ricky Bell. The route was climbed onsight in 2015 by Pete Whittaker, who protected the lower half with skyhooks. In June 2016, U.S. climber Alex Honnold soloed the route, and his ascent was captured on video. Base camps are usually established near the tops of the descent routes; the walk-ins this far are pleasant and quite short, through the open grazing fields above the crag. However, access to some of the climbs themselves can be quite rough and time-consuming. =Visiting the crag= The Dal Riada Climbing Club formerly had the use of a series of buildings which they operated as climbing huts which they used to accommodate themselves and other visiting climbers, but this ended in 2007 when the last one was repossessed by its owners, the National Trust. The most popular options now are either camping at a nearby campsite operated by a local farmer, or staying at a hostel in Ballycastle town, where there are bars and restaurants.

He was appointed prime minister in February 1979 by Ayatollah Khomeini, making him Iran's first prime minister after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. He resigned his position in November of the same year, in protest at the US Embassy takeover and as an acknowledgement of his government's failure in preventing it. He was the head of the first engineering department of University of Tehran. A well-respected religious intellectual, known for his honesty and expertise in the Islamic and secular sciences, he is credited with being one of the founders of the contemporary intellectual movement in Iran. Early life and education A young Bazargan Bazargan was born into an Azerbaijani familyThe Rising Tide of Cultural Pluralism: The Nation-State at Bay?, Crawford Young, p. 127, 1993 in Tehran on 1 September 1907.Biography: Mehdi Bazargan BBC Persian 2009 His father, Hajj Abbasqoli Tabrizi (died 1954) was a self-made merchant and a religious activist in bazaar guilds. Bazargan went to France to receive university education through an Iranian government scholarship during the reign of Reza Shah. He attended Lyc√©e Georges Clemenceau in Nantes and was a classmate of Abdollah Riazi. Bazargan then studied thermodynamics and engineering at the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (√âcole Centrale Paris). Following his return to Iran, Bazargan was called up for conscription, and served from 1935 to 1937. According to Houchang Chehabi, Bazargan was firstly tasked with shifting pebbles in a barracks but was then moved to translate technical articles from French. Career After his graduation, Bazargan became the head of the first engineering department at Tehran University in the late 1940s. He was a deputy minister under Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh in the 1950s. Bazargan served as the first Iranian head of the National Iranian Oil Company under the administration of Prime Minister Mosaddegh. Bazargan co-founded the Liberation Movement of Iran in 1961, a party similar in its program to Mossadegh's National Front. Although he accepted the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as the legitimate head of state, he was jailed several times on political grounds. =Iranian Revolution= On 4 February 1979, Bazargan was appointed prime minister of Iran by Ayatollah Khomeini. He was seen as one of the democratic and liberal figureheads of the revolution who came into conflict with the more radical religious leaders ‚Äì including Khomeini himself ‚Äì as the revolution progressed. Although pious, Bazargan initially disputed the name Islamic Republic, wanting an Islamic Democratic Republic. He had also been a supporter of the original (non-theocratic) revolutionary draft constitution, and opposed the Assembly of Experts for Constitution and the constitution they wrote that was eventually adopted as Iran's constitution. Seeing his government's lack of power, in March 1979, he submitted his resignation to Ayatollah Khomeini. Khomeini did not accept his resignation, and in April 1979, he and his cabinet members were reported to have escaped an assassination attempt. Bazargan resigned, along with his cabinet, on 4 November 1979, following the US Embassy takeover and hostage-taking. His resignation was considered a protest against the hostage-taking and a recognition of his government's inability to free the hostages, but it was also clear that his hopes for liberal democracy and an accommodation with the West would not prevail. Bazargan sworn in as prime minister behind Ruhollah Khomeini in the absence of Parliament Bazargan continued in Iranian politics as a member of the first Parliament (Majles) of the newly formed Islamic Republic. He openly opposed Iran's cultural revolution and continued to advocate civil rule and democracy. In November 1982, he expressed his frustration with the direction the Islamic Revolution had taken in an open letter to the then speaker of parliament Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. > The government has created an atmosphere of terror, fear, revenge and > national disintegration. ... What has the ruling elite done in nearly four > years, besides bringing death and destruction, packing the prisons and the > cemeteries in every city, creating long queues, shortages, high prices, > unemployment, poverty, homeless people, repetitious slogans and a dark > future? Bazargan with Yasser Arafat His term as a member of parliament lasted until 1984. During his term, he served as a lawmaker of the Iran Freedom Movement, which he had founded in 1961, and which was abolished in 1990. In 1985, the Council of Guardians denied Bazargan's petition to run for president. =Views= Bazargan is a respected figure within the ranks of modern Muslim thinkers, known as a representative of liberal-democratic Islamic thought and a thinker who emphasized the necessity of constitutional and democratic policies. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution Bazargan led a faction that opposed the Revolutionary Council dominated by the Islamic Republican Party and personalities such as Ayatollah Mohammad Hossein Beheshti. He opposed the continuation of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and the involvement of clerics in all aspects of politics, economy and society. Consequently, he faced harassment from militants and young revolutionaries within Iran. Bazargan believed that there is a link and relation between politics and religion, but did not believe in Political Islam (hokumat). =Attacks= During the Pahlavi era, Bazargan's house in Tehran was bombed on 8 April 1978. The underground committee for revenge, a state-financed organization, proclaimed the responsibility of the bombing. =Laws of social evolution= Bazargan is known for some of the earliest work in human thermodynamics, as found in his 1946 chapter \\"A Physiological Analysis of Human Thermodynamics\\" and his 1956 book Love and Worship: Human Thermodynamics, the latter of which being written while in prison, in which he attempted to show that religion and worship are a byproduct of evolution, as explained in English naturalist Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), and that the true laws of society are based on the laws of thermodynamics. Death Bazargan died of a heart attack on 20 January 1995 in Switzerland. He died at a hospital in Zurich after collapsing at the airport. He was travelling to the United States for heart surgery. Personal life Bazargan married Malak Tabatabai in 1939. They had five children, two sons and three daughters.

Another classification of theories distinguishes between Structural Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Process Analysis, Integrative Analysis and behavioral analysis of negotiations. Individuals should make separate, interactive decisions; and negotiation analysis considers how groups of reasonably bright individuals should and could make joint, collaborative decisions. These theories are interleaved and should be approached from the synthetic perspective. Common assumptions of most theories Negotiation is a specialized and formal version of conflict resolution most frequently employed when important issues must be agreed upon. Negotiation is necessary when one party requires the other party's agreement to achieve its aim. The aim of negotiating is to build a shared environment leading to long-term trust and often involves a third, neutral party to extract the issues from the emotions and keep the individuals concerned focused. It is a powerful method for resolving conflict and requires skill and experience. Zartman defines negotiation as \\"a process of combining conflicting positions into a common position under a decision rule of unanimity, a phenomenon in which the outcome is determined by the process.\\" Druckman (1986) adds that negotiations pass through stages that consist of agenda setting, a search for guiding principles, defining the issues, bargaining for favorable concession exchanges, and a search for implementing details. Transitions between stages are referred to as turning points.Druckman, D. (1986). \\"Stages, crises, and turning points: Negotiating military base rights, Spain and the United States.\\" Journal of Conflict Resolution, 30 (2): 327-360. Most theories of negotiations share the notion of negotiations as a process, but they differ in their description of the process. Structural, strategic and procedural analysis build on rational actors, who are able to prioritize clear goals, are able to make trade-offs between conflicting values, are consistent in their behavioral pattern, and are able to take uncertainty into account. Negotiations differ from mere coercion, in that negotiating parties have the theoretic possibility to withdraw from negotiations. It is easier to study bi-lateral negotiations, as opposed to multilateral negotiations. Structural analysis Structural Analysis is based on a distribution of empowering elements among two negotiating parties. Structural theory moves away from traditional Realist notions of power in that it does not only consider power to be a possession, manifested for example in economic or military resources, but also thinks of power as a relation. Based on the distribution of elements, in structural analysis we find either power-symmetry between equally strong parties or power-asymmetry between a stronger and a weaker party. All elements from which the respective parties can draw power constitute structure. They may be of material nature, i.e. hard power (such as weapons), or of social nature, i.e. soft power (such as norms, contracts or precedents). These instrumental elements of power, are either defined as parties‚Äô relative position (resources position) or as their relative ability to make their options prevail. According to structural analysis, negotiations can be described with matrices, such as the Prisoner's dilemma, a concept taken from game theory. Another common game is the chicken dilemma. Structural analysis is easy to criticize, because it predicts that the strongest will always win. This, however, does not always hold true. Strategic analysis Strategic analysis starts with the assumption that both parties have a veto. Thus, in essence, negotiating parties can cooperate (C) or defect (D). Structural analysis then evaluates √Å outcomes of negotiations (C, C; C, D; D, D; D, C), by assigning values to each of the possible outcomes. Often, co-operation of both sides yields the best outcome. The problem is that the parties can never be sure that the other is going to cooperate, mainly because of two reasons: first, decisions are made at the same time or, second, concessions of one side might not be returned. Therefore the parties have contradicting incentives to cooperate or defect. If one party cooperates or makes a concession and the other does not, the defecting party might relatively gain more. Trust may be built only in repetitive games through the emergence of reliable patterns of behavior such as tit-for-tat. This table illustrates the options and possible outcomes of the Negotiator's Dilemma. Process analysis Process analysis is the theory closest to haggling. Process Analysis focuses on the study of the dynamics of processes. E.g. both Zeuthen and Cross tried to find a formula in order to predict the behavior of the other party in finding a rate of concession, in order to predict the likely outcome. The process of negotiation therefore is considered to unfold between fixed points: starting point of discord, end point of convergence. The so-called security point, that is the result of optional withdrawal, is also taken into account. An important feature of negotiation processes is the idea of turning points (TPs). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to analyses of TPs in single and comparative case studies as well as experiments. Considered as departures in the process, Druckman (2001, 2004) has proposed a three-part framework for analysis in which precipitating events precede (and cause) departures which have immediate and delayed consequences. Precipitating events can be external as when a mediator becomes involved, substantive as when a new idea is proposed, or procedural as when the formal plenary structure becomes divided into committees. Departures can be abrupt or relatively slow and consequences can be escalatory, moving away from agreement, or de-escalatory, moving in the direction of agreement. Using this framework in a comparative study of 34 cases, Druckman (2001) discovered that external events were needed to move talks on security or arms control toward agreement. However new ideas or changed procedures were more important for progress in trade or political negotiations. Different patterns were also found for interest-based, cognitive-based, and values-based conflicts (Druckman, 2005) and between domestic and international negotiations (Hall, 2012). Turning points are also analyzed in relation to negotiation crises or disruptions in the flow of the talks. Earlier research showed that TPs are more likely to occur in the context of crises, often in the form of changes that put the talks back on track and transition to a new stage (Druckman, 1986, 2001). A key to resolving crises is reframing the issues being discussed. The choice to reframe was shown to occur more frequently among negotiators when their trust is low and transaction costs are high (Druckman and Olekalns, 2013). The research to date on TPs has generated ideas likely to stimulate further studies. Some of these ideas include a search for the underlying mechanisms that can explain the emergence of TPs. Foremost among these are flexibility and adaptability in response to crises or violations of expected behavior. The key challenge is to discover the conditions that foster progress toward a solution to the dilemma of balancing the desire to agree with the desire to come out favorably. For a review of the research on turning points see Druckman and Olekalns (2013a). Integrative analysis Integrative analysis divides the process into successive stages, rather than talking about fixed points. It extends analysis to pre-negotiations stages, in which parties make first contacts. The outcome is explained as the performance of the actors at different stages. Stages may include pre-negotiations, finding a formula of distribution, crest behavior, settlement Bad faith negotiation Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.\\"negotiating in bad faith\\", example of use of \\"bad faith\\" from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, \\"Bad Faith Negotiation\\", Union Voice =Inherent bad faith model in international relations and political psychology= Bad faith in political science and political psychology refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of information processing.example of use ‚Äì \\"the Republicans accused the Democrats of negotiating in bad faith\\", Oxford Online Dictionary, The \\"inherent bad faith model\\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles‚Äô beliefs and his model of information processing.The ‚ÄúInherent Bad Faith Model‚Äù Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.‚Äú‚Ä¶the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one‚Äôs opponent...\\", The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1‚Äì2, edited by Daniel T.

Participatory budgeting allows citizens to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent. PB processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth. A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government transparency and accountability, increased levels of public participation (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning. The frameworks of PB differentiate variously throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. PB, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of PB vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, PB has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, PB has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology. PB stands as one of several democratic innovations such as British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly, encompassing the ideals of a participatory democracy. Today, PB has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world. Procedure Most broadly, all participatory budgeting schemes allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives subjurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. There is, therefore, a need for mediating institutions to facilitate the aggregation of budget preferences expressed by subjurisdictions. According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for PB to be adopted: \\"[‚Ä¶] strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators' attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens.\\" In addition, there are generally two approaches through which PB formulates: top-down versus bottom-up. The adoption of PB has been required by the federal government in nations such as Peru, while there are cases where local governments initiated PB independent from the national agenda such as Porto Alegre. With the bottom-up approach, NGO's and local organizations have played crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members. PB processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps: * The municipality is divided geographically into multiple districts. * Representatives of the divided districts are either elected or volunteered to work with government officials in a PB committee. * The committees are established with regularly scheduled meetings under a specific timeline to deliberate. * Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc. * Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on. * The drafted budget is shared to the public and put for a vote. * The municipal government implements the top proposals. * The cycle is repeated on an annual basis. A participatory budgeting algorithm is sometimes used in order to calculate the budget allocation from the votes.  History  Participatory budgeting has been practiced in Porto Alegre since 1989. Participatory Budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the Brazilian Workers' Party, drawing on the party's stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a spring board for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the Brazilian Democratic Movement in municipalities such as Pelotas ), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in 1989, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, a capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center, at that time with a population of 1.2 million. The initial success of PB in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented PB, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. =Porto Alegre= In its first Title, the 1988 Constitution of Brazil states that \\"All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution.\\" The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of military dictatorship, and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge. Brazil's contemporary political economy is an outgrowth of the Portuguese empire's patrimonial capitalism, where \\"power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships\\". Unlike the Athenian ideal of democracy, in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil's government is structured as a republic with elected representatives. This institutional arrangement has created a separation between the state and civil society, which has opened the doors for clientelism. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain 'clients', typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors, and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader represents the views of shop owners to the local party boss, asking for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. In exchange, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party bosses and influential citizens rather than the broader public. In 1989, Ol√≠vio Dutra won the mayor's seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT's organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is one example of what we now know as Participatory Budgeting. = Outcomes = A World Bank paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, sewer and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986. The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999). In a paper that updated the World Bank's methodology, expanding statistical scope and analyzing Brazil's 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term ‚Äì it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term. Researchers have also found that participatory budgeting has had greater impact throughout long periods of time. This impact has shown that civil society is able to create a more efficient and effective form of governing. The paper concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the poor. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as unemployment, it leads to \\"noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various public welfare amenities\\". Based on Porto Alegre more than 140 (about 2.5%) of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil have adopted participatory budgeting. For other adaptations of Participatory Budgeting around the world, see participatory budgeting by country. *  Criticism  Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre, a World Bank paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge. What are the insights regarding the opportunities for and barriers to accomplishing the goal of participatory-based budgeting? It takes leadership to flatten the organizational structure and make conscious ethical responsibilities as individuals and as committee members try to achieve the democratic goals means that the press should be present for the public, and yet the presence of the press inhibits the procedural need for robust discussion. Or, while representation is a cornerstone to participatory budgeting, a group being so large has an effect on the efficiency of the group. Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing clientelism. Other observations include that particular groups are less likely to participate once their demands have been met and that slow progress of public works can frustrate participants. In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects.

The city belonged to the Seljuk Turks and opted to surrender to the Byzantines in fear of the crusaders breaking into the city. The siege was followed by the Battle of Dorylaeum, and the siege of Antioch, all of which are in modern Turkey. Background Nicaea, located on the eastern shore of Lake Askania, had been captured from the Byzantine Empire by the Seljuk Turks in 1081, and formed the capital of the Sultanate of Rum. In 1096, the People's Crusade, the first stage of the First Crusade, had plundered the land surrounding the city, before being destroyed by the Turks. As a result, Sultan Kilij Arslan I initially felt that the second wave of crusaders were not a threat. He left his family and his treasury behind in Nicaea and went east to fight the Danishmends for control of the Melitene. Crusader siege The crusaders began to leave Constantinople at the end of April 1097. Godfrey of Bouillon was the first to arrive at Nicaea, with Bohemond of Taranto, Bohemond's nephew Tancred, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and Robert II of Flanders following him, along with Peter the Hermit and some of the survivors of the People's Crusade, and a small Byzantine force under Manuel Boutoumites. They arrived on May 6, severely short on food, but Bohemond arranged for food to be brought by land and by sea. They put the city to siege beginning on May 14, assigning their forces to different sections of the walls, which was well- defended with 200 towers. Bohemond camped on the north side of the city, Godfrey on the south, and Raymond and Adhemar of Le Puy on the eastern gate. Defeat of Kilij Arslan On May 16, the Turkish defenders sallied out to attack the crusaders, but the Turks were defeated in a skirmish with the loss of 200 men. The Turks sent messages to Kilij Arslan begging him to return, and when he realized the strength of the crusaders he quickly turned back. An advance party was defeated by troops under Raymond and Robert of Flanders on May 20, and on May 21 the crusader army defeated Kilij in a pitched battle which lasted long into the night. Losses were heavy on both sides, but in the end the Sultan retreated despite the pleas of the Nicaean Turks. The rest of the crusaders arrived throughout the rest of May, with Robert Curthose (accompanied by Ralph de Guader) and Stephen of Blois arriving at the beginning of June. Meanwhile, Raymond and Adhemar built a large siege engine, which was rolled up to the Gonatas Tower in order to engage the defenders on the walls while miners mined the tower from below. The tower was damaged but no further progress was made. Byzantine arrival Byzantine emperor Alexios I chose not to accompany the crusaders, but marched out behind them and made his camp at nearby Pelecanum. From there, he sent boats, rolled over the land, to help the crusaders blockade Lake Ascanius, which had up to this point been used by the Turks to supply Nicaea with food. The boats arrived on June 17, under the command of Manuel Boutoumites. The general Tatikios was also sent, with 2,000 foot soldiers. Alexios had instructed Boutoumites to secretly negotiate the surrender of the city without the crusaders' knowledge. Tatikios was instructed to join with the crusaders and make a direct assault on the walls, while Boutoumites would pretend to do the same to make it look as if the Byzantines had captured the city in battle. This was done, and on June 19 the Turks surrendered to Boutoumites. When the crusaders discovered what Alexios had done, they were quite angry, as they had hoped to plunder the city for money and supplies. Boutoumites, however, was named dux of Nicaea and forbade the crusaders from entering in groups larger than 10 men at a time. Boutoumites also expelled the Turkish generals, whom he considered just as untrustworthy. Kilij Arslan's family went to Constantinople and were eventually released without ransom. Alexios gave the crusaders money, horses, and other gifts, but the crusaders were not pleased with this, believing they could have had even more if they had captured Nicaea themselves. Boutoumites would not permit them to leave until they had all sworn an oath of vassalage to Alexios, if they had not yet done so in Constantinople. As he had in Constantinople, Tancred at first refused, but he eventually gave in. Aftermath The crusaders left Nicaea on June 26, in two contingents: Bohemond, Tancred, Robert of Flanders, and Tatikios in the vanguard, and Godfrey, Baldwin of Boulogne, Stephen, and Hugh of Vermandois in the rear. Tatikios was instructed to ensure the return of captured cities to the empire. Their spirits were high, and Stephen wrote to his wife Adela that they expected to be in Jerusalem in five weeks. On July 1, they defeated Kilij at the Battle of Dorylaeum, and by October they reached Antioch; they would not reach Jerusalem until two years after leaving Nicaea.

A ruling clique can include people from various professions. The ruling elites who comprise the leadership tend to form a council, political party, or another form of an organized group. The high- ranking members share a rough balance of power although sometimes one or more members seek to increase their power at the expense of others or some of them may attempt to transform the system into an autocracy or make it more democratic. Some ruling cliques could be considered a form of aristocracy while others are based on a very small circle of rulers rather than a broader based organization such as a political party.

It particularly distressed him that his character, a man in his 30s, had to defer continually to the wishes of his widowed father, and he reportedly disliked the series itself, calling it \\"junk\\" television and accusing NBC of \\"perpetuating banality and contributing to the dehumanization of the industry.\\" The equally self-critical Roberts (\\"I guess I'll never be satisfied with my own work\\"Wick Temple, \\"Bonanza's Adam Now in Camelot,\\" Chicago Tribune August 19, 1965, p.A2), \\"had long disdained the medium's commercialization of his craft and its mass production, assembly- line mindset.\\"Jeff Prince, \\"Pernell Roberts Ghost Rides In Sky\\", Fort Worth Weekly January 26, 2010 full text Frustrated with Bonanza and angry, he told a reporter in 1965, \\"I feel I'm an aristocrat in my field of endeavor. My being part of Bonanza was like Isaac Stern sitting in with Lawrence Welk\\".\\"Ponderosa Gold Under A Painted Sky,\\" Joanne Stang, p. 305 in \\"Popular Culture,\\" by David Manning, 1975 In much later interviews, Roberts denied statements about Bonanza attributed to him. \\"I did not enjoy Bonanza anymore...but I never said those things people said I said.\\" He was, however, \\"too smart not to recognize its weaknesses.\\" In a 1963 interview, he asked a reporter, \\"Isn't it a bit silly for three adult males to have to ask father's permission for everything they do?\\"Washington Post, January 25, 2010 \\"They told me the four characters (Lorne Greene, patriarch Ben, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon as his brothers) would be carefully defined and the scripts carefully prepared; none of it ever happened,\\" he complained to The Associated Press in 1964. He objected to how Bonanza portrayed the relationship between the \\"father\\" and adult \\"sons,\\" describing it as \\"adolescent\\".Mike Douglas Show, 1966 Roberts acknowledged reasons for Bonanza's appeal, but pointed to his personal need for story lines with greater social relevance, adult themes and dialogue. He wanted Bonanza to be \\"a little more grown up,\\" (Mike Douglas Show, 1966). He also noted that he was not suited to the \\"procedural\\" and \\"confining aspect\\" of series television, another reason for his dissatisfaction, while on the show (Mike Douglas Show, 1966). As Adam in \\"The Hopefuls\\" (1960) Roberts had high hopes for what he could contribute to Bonanza and was disappointed with the direction of the show, the limitations imposed on his Bonanza character and on his acting range. In a newspaper interview, he said, \\"I haven't grown at all since the series began...I have an impotent role. Wherever I turn there's the father image.\\" (This Time Pernell Won't Need a Tuba, Washington Post, May 1, 1963, Lawrence Laurent). Finally, after disagreements with writers and producers over the quality of the scripts, characterization, and Bonanza's refusal to allow him to perform elsewhere while on contract, Roberts \\"turned his back on Hollywood wisdom and well-meant advice,\\" and left, largely to return to legitimate theater (Washington Post, January 25, 2010; New York Daily News January 26, 2010; Mike Douglas Show, 1965, 1966); Henry Darrow archival interview; USA Today, January 25, 2010). Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene, and Roberts in Bonanza, 1959 Roberts fulfilled but did not extend his six-year contract for Bonanza, and when he left the series, his character was eliminated with the explanation that Adam had \\"moved away.\\" Later episodes suggested variously that Adam was \\"at sea\\", had moved to Europe, or was on the East Coast, running that end of the family business. The last episode Pernell Roberts worked on was \\"Dead and Gone\\", air date April 4, 1965. He appeared in the next two that aired which were filmed prior to \\"Dead and Gone\\" ‚Äî \\"A Good Night's Rest\\", air date April 11, 1965, and \\"To Own The World\\", air date April 18, 1965. Adam Cartwright was mentioned on occasion in the series (including a 1967 episode which did not air until April 4, 1971 (\\"Kingdom of Fear\\"). In television interviews, Roberts said that he would have stayed with Bonanza, had he been allowed to do so on a part-time basis to enable him to return to theater.(Mike Douglas Show, 1966). Bonanza producer David Dortort described Roberts as \\"rebellious, outspoken... and aloof,\\" but, as one who \\"could make any scene he was in better...\\". In a later archive interview, he regretted not having insisted on a \\"marriage for Adam\\" and having Roberts continue on the show as a semiregular. He added, \\"I must confess..I was too hard on him. I did not appreciate him. I knew he was good, but I didn't realize he was that good...none better.\\"(Archive Interview 2002; Bonanza, The Official First Season, Volume 1, Feature, CBS/Paramount, 2009) In the last two Bonanza movies that aired on NBC in the early 1990s, the story line stated that Adam, now in Australia, had equaled his father's success, dominating the engineering/construction business. Roberts in Bonanza, 1961 Roberts was the only accomplished singer of the original cast, though David Canary, who joined Bonanza in 1967, had a background in voice and performed on Broadway. During Roberts' Bonanza years, he recorded Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies, a folk music album which AllMusic calls \\"...the softer, lyrical side of folk music ‚Äî pleasant and not challenging, but quite rewarding in its unassuming way.\\"[ Allmusic entry for Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies.] Accessed October 28, 2008. The album, released by RCA Victor and arranged by Dick Rosmini, is available on compact disc only as part of the fourth disc of the Bonanza 4-CD boxed set on Bear Family Records.Bear Family boxed set Accessed November 7, 2008 On the Bonanza box set albums, Roberts also sings \\"Early One Morning\\", \\"In the Pines\\", \\"The New Born King\\", \\"The Bold Soldier\\", \\"Mary Ann\\", \\"They Call the Wind Maria\\", \\"Sylvie\\", \\"Lily of the West\\", \\"The Water is Wide\\", \\"Rake and a Ramblin' Boy\\", \\"A Quiet Girl\\", \\"Shady Grove\\", \\"Alberta\\", and \\"Empty Pocket Blues\\". After Bonanza Pernell Roberts, 1965 After Bonanza, Roberts played summer stock theatre, regional theaters, and episodic TV, which gave him the opportunity to play a wide variety of roles. He toured with musicals such as The King and I, Kiss Me Kate, Camelot, and The Music Man, and dramas such as Tiny Alice. He played Jigger in an ABC television presentation of Carousel and was featured in a CBS Playhouse production, Dear Friends. In 1967, Roberts starred in the lavish, but short- lived David Merrick production of Mata Hari, directed by Vincente Minnelli. The show had a much-publicized \\"chaotic\\" preview performance due to technical problems stemming from lack of rehearsal time at the Kennedy Center, Washington, DC, where the preview performance took place. \\"What was offered the people of Washington was a dress rehearsal. David Merrick spoke to the audience beforehand warning them of this.\\" Problems were corrected by the official opening night, when the show received good reviews for Roberts, musical score and lyrics, stage design and costumes, but poor reviews for its co-star and other aspects of the production. The show, nevertheless, was thought to have the potential to continue to Broadway. \\"Mata Hari was a show with a great story, two fascinating characters, and some accessory mess that could have easily been tidied up by anyone but Vincente Minnelli.\\" But Merrick, \\"instead of bringing someone to clean house closed the production down\\" (\\"Opening A New Window: The Broadway Musical in the 1960s,\\" p. 205 Ethan Morrden, October 29, 2002). In 1972, Roberts returned to Broadway and toured with Ingrid Bergman in Captain Brassbound's Conversion, in which he played the title role. \\"Particularly helpful is Pernell Roberts in the acted upon title role... This actor is a sturdy, not unamusing leading-man type and may his appearance as a Bergman costar be rewarded beyond Bonanza.\\" In 1973, Roberts was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for his performance in Welcome Home at the Ivanhoe Theatre in Chicago. The same year, Roberts starred as Rhett Butler opposite Lesley Ann Warren, in another major production, Gone with the Wind, at the Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, again receiving good personal reviews, amidst weak reviews for the rest of the show. Additional stage credits after Bonanza include Two for the Seesaw, A Thousand Clowns, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Any Wednesday, and The Sound of Music (as Captain von Trapp). He did The Night of the Iguana while still playing in Bonanza in 1963. Publicity photo of Pernell Roberts, 1972 Roberts played Jim Conrad, the lead role, in the 1971 TV movie that served as a pilot for the series San Francisco International Airport, though the role was played by Lloyd Bridges in the actual episodes of the series. Roberts guest-starred in TV shows such as The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., The Virginian, The Big Valley, Lancer, Mission: Impossible (4 episodes), Have Gun Will Travel, Marcus Welby, M.D., The Wild Wild West, Ironside (2 episodes), The Rockford Files, Gunsmoke, Mannix, Vega$, The Odd Couple, Hawaii Five-O, The Love Boat, Hotel, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, Nakia, Night Gallery, The Bold Ones, The Quest, Police Story, Most Wanted, Westside Medical, Man From Atlantis, Jigsaw John, Sixth Sense, Quincy, M.E. The Feather and Father Gang, Hawkins, Men from Shiloh, Perry Mason, Wide World of Mystery, and The Six Million Dollar Man, and appeared in miniseries, including Captains and the Kings, Centennial, The Immigrants and Around the World in 80 Days. He starred in two cult films, Four Rode Out (1971) and Kashmiri Run (1970), directed by the veteran TV director John Peyser, and other feature films, including The Magic of Lassie (1978). He co-starred or was featured in several TV movies, including, The Adventures of Nick Carter, Dead Man on the Run, Assignment: Munich, The Night Rider, The Silent Gun, The Lives of Jenny Dolan, The Deadly Tower, Hot Rod, Desperado, The Bravos, and High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane. In 1979, Roberts again achieved \\"superstar\\" statusTV Guide, 1982 as the lead in Trapper John, M.D. (1979‚Äì1986), receiving an Emmy nomination in 1981; and playing the character twice as long as Wayne Rogers had (1972‚Äì1975) on CBSs M*A*S*H series. Roberts told TV Guide (1979) that he chose to return to weekly television after watching his father age and realizing that it was a vulnerable time to be without financial security. \\"The show allowed Roberts to both use his dramatic range and address issues,\\" wrote The Independent. Of the period between series, Roberts said he enjoyed moving around and playing different characters. During that time, he also toured university campuses conducting seminars on play production, acting, and poetry. In 1980, Roberts reunited with his former Bonanza co-star Lorne Greene, for 2 episodes of Vega$. In 1988, Roberts co-starred with Milla Jovovich in the TV movie The Night Train to Kathmandu. He guest-starred as Hezekiah Horn in the powerful Young Riders episode, \\"Requiem for a Hero\\", for which he won a Western Heritage Award in 1991.Western Heritage Award In interviews, Roberts had described television as a \\"director's and film cutter's medium,\\"The Pittsburgh Press, \\"Cartwrights Meant Cartwheels,\\" Vince Leonard, April 28, 1967. but he himself was described as a \\"born television actor........low key.\\" (TV Guide, 1982). In the 1980s and 1990s, playing off his Trapper John M.D. persona, Roberts acted as TV spokesman for Ecotrin, a brand of analgesic tablets. Roles since included Donor (1990) with Melissa Gilbert and Checkered Flag (1990). He appeared as captain of the CBS teams for Battle of the Network Stars 11 and 12. He narrated documentaries, including the National Geographic episode, \\"Alaska, The Great Land\\" in 1965, \\"In the Realm of the Alligator\\" in 1986, the TV special Code One about the work of paramedics in 1989, and \\"The Mountain Men\\" episode of the History Channel, 1999. From 1991 to 1993, in his last venture into series television, Roberts lent his distinctive voice to host and narrate the TV anthology series, FBI: The Untold Stories. He made his last TV appearance in 1997 on an episode of Diagnosis: Murder, updating a Mannix character he had portrayed decades before. In his later life, and after the death of all of his former Bonanza co-stars, Roberts \\"jokingly referred to himself as, 'Pernell, the last one, Roberts.'\\"(New York Times, January 26, 2010; Cowboydirectory.com). He read Bonanza Gold Magazine, which was like looking at an old family album, he said, and watched reruns of Bonanza when he wanted to see old friends.(Bonanza Gold Magazine, 2005). Personal life and death Onstage, 1972 Roberts married four times, first in 1951 to Vera Mowry -- a professor of theatre history at Washington State University and subsequently Hunter College, as well as professor emerita of the Ph.D. program in theatre at City University of New York ‚Äî with whom he had his only child (Jonathan Christopher \\"Chris\\" Roberts, 1951‚Äì1989).

It is situated to the west of a point where the River Mersey narrows, known as Runcorn Gap. Originally opening directly into the Mersey, with the building of the Manchester Ship Canal, it now links with this canal. History =Early days= Until the 18th century, the major port in northwest England was Chester. However silting of the River Dee prevented access to Chester and in 1708 Thomas Steers was commissioned to build the first wet dock in Liverpool. By 1710 Liverpool had become the third largest port in the country contributing ¬£50,000 in customs revenue. During the early- mid 18th century the major materials passing through Liverpool were salt from Cheshire and coal from the Lancashire coalfields. Other important materials were building stone, roofing slates from North Wales, and ores, particularly copper ore, from Anglesey. Later came imports of cotton, timber and grain to Manchester, and potters' materials to The Potteries. These materials were carried mainly by flat-bottomed barges known as Mersey flats. In the mid- Mersey area communications were being improved by the development of inland waterways, including the Sankey Canal from St Helens to Warrington which was completed in 1757, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the act for which achieved Royal Assent in 1720, and the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester to Runcorn, which opened throughout its length in 1776. Bridgewater House in 2004 There is the possibility that a small port was in existence at Runcorn in the Roman era. However, before 1780 Runcorn could not have been described as even a minor port. The construction of a port of any significance did not start until after the arrival of the Bridgewater Canal. A line of ten locks connected the Runcorn basin of the canal with the Mersey at a position to the west of Runcorn Gap. Close to this point the Duke of Bridgewater built two tidal basins, two warehouses, a dry dock and a house, Bridgewater House, from which to supervise the work. To the west of this area he later built the dock, which opened in 1791. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened. This connected the Mersey and Irwell Navigation with the River Mersey at Runcorn. In 1810 the Weston Canal was built between Frodsham and the Weston Point area of Runcorn to avoid the difficult entrance to the mouth of the River Weaver. At Weston Point a dock was established. At the terminus of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal, in an area known as Old Quay, on the east side of Runcorn Gap, a dock was opened in 1826. This dock was built by the Mersey and Irwell company and included two sets of locks, one for incoming craft and the other for those leaving the canal. By this time the port of Runcorn comprised three separate companies, the Bridgewater Trustees, the Mersey and Irwell company, and the Weaver Trustees. In the early years of the 19th century the amount of cargo passing through the docks steadily increased. From 1816 to 1834 the Bridgewater dock increased its trade from 76,000 tons to 118,000 tons and the Mersey and Irwell from 90,000 tons to 135,000 tons. To cope with this increased business the Bridgewater Trustees built a new dock, the Francis Dock, which opened in 1843. In 1844 the Mersey and Irwell Company was purchased by the Trustees of the Bridgewater Canal. Tidal dock at the end of the Bridgewater Canal in 2004 =Independent customs port= Throughout this time the port of Runcorn remained part of the port of Liverpool. Towards the middle of the 19th century the port was becoming more important and this was recognised on 5 April 1847 when it was designated as an independent customs port. Its boundary extended on both sides of the Mersey from Warrington Bridge in the east to a point on a line stretching from Eastham church in Cheshire to Chapel Farm House in Lancashire. It included the waters of the River Weaver up to Frodsham Bridge. It included, on the north bank of the Mersey, Widnes Dock, the first purpose-built railway dock in the world. A more dignified customs house was built to mark the event. However Runcorn's status as an independent customs port was not a success. Few large ships were registered in the port or transferred from the Liverpool register and on 12 April 1850 it became part of the Port of Liverpool again. However the port's prospects improved at this time with the abolition of the Navigation Acts (which had restricted the use of foreign shipping), and an increasing number of foreign vessels began to arrive at the docks. Trade increased so much that the Bridgewater Trustees were having difficulty in coping with the increased trade. In 1853 an act promoted by the Earl of Ellesmere led to the construction of a short canal, the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which connected the Francis Dock to the Weston Canal. This was opened for traffic on 25 February 1860. At this time the Runcorn docks were coming under increasing competition from the railways, especially from the St Helens Canal and Railway Company who opened Garston Dock downstream on the north bank of the Mersey. Runcorn was appointed again as an independent customs port on 1 January 1862. In 1860 the Bridgewater Trustees had opened the Alfred Dock, which was fitted with hydraulic cranes. In 1862 a telegraph line was installed which linked the dock with the Bridgewater Trustees' offices in Manchester and their dock in Liverpool. From around this time there was a considerable increase in trade; in April of that year over 110 vessels entered the port, which was more than could be conveniently accommodated. In order to deal with the increased trade the Bridgewater Trustees began to build a new dock in 1867 and to remove obstructions from the river. The new dock was the Arnold Dock and this was opened in 1870. Before the repeal of the Navigation Acts most of the trade had been coastal; there now came a considerable increase in foreign trade. In 1845 foreign trade had been virtually nothing; in 1871 the export trade amounted to 43,000 tons and the imports more than 30,000. Matters were not as successful with the Mersey and Irwell business because there had been no major dock improvements since 1829 and the approach channels were silting up. On the north bank of the Mersey, West Bank Dock at Widnes was busy especially with importing raw materials and exporting chemicals and fertilisers. The other major materials passing through the port were raw cotton, potter's clay, salt, coal and soap. During the 1870s the business of the port was beginning to decline because of the progressive silting of the shipping channels. When the Duke of Bridgewater died in 1803 he left his coal mining and canal businesses to be run by a Trust. In 1872 the navigation part of the trust was sold to the Bridgewater Navigation Company at a cost of ¬£1,115,000; this consisted of the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigations, together with their docks and warehouses. The company developed further improvements including a new dock, the Fenton Dock (named after the chairman of the company) which was completed in 1875 at a cost of ¬£50,000. This was equipped with hydraulic cranes and served by high level tramways and railway sidings. Meanwhile, the Weaver Trustees were developing their trade, having built the Delamere Dock in 1870. The engineer for this dock was Edward Leader Williams who later became the engineer for the Manchester Ship Canal. There were no further large scale developments at the port until the Tollemache Dock was opened at Weston Point in 1885. =Coming of the Manchester Ship Canal= From about 1877 the silting of the channels started to improve and trade improved again. The improvement continued until 1889 when the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal caused problems. Trade declined again and in 1894 the independent customs Port of Runcorn was abolished being incorporated in the Port of Manchester. Construction of the ship canal began in November 1877. On 3 August 1887 the Manchester Ship Canal Company had purchased the Bridgewater Navigation Company for ¬£1,710,000, thus acquiring the Bridgewater Canal and its docks and the Mersey and Irwell system. The ship canal allowed large ocean-going ships to access the Port of Runcorn. The canal was completed from Eastham to Weston Point by 1892 and in July of that year a temporary port, called Saltport, was established at the mouth of the River Weaver. By 1893 the ship canal was opened as far as the Old Quay Dock. In order to allow direct access to the Port of Runcorn and the Weaver Navigation four locks were built. Weston Marsh lock at the mouth of the Weaver allowed access to the Weaver Navigation, Weston Mersey lock enabled entrance to the Weaver Docks, the Bridgewater docks were served by the Bridgewater lock and the Old Quay dock by the Runcorn Old Quay lock. The ship canal was opened throughout its length in 1894. Saltport was bypassed and a few years later it was dismantled. To the east of the Bridgewater Dock the ship canal passes under Runcorn Railway Bridge which has a clearance of above the high water mark of the Mersey. This meant that the larger of the tall ships could not pass under the bridge. A lay-by was therefore built for these ships to discharge their cargo, which was carried onwards by a lighter to its destination. The lay-by was big enough to accommodate the largest merchant vessels of the day. While the larger vessels approached the Runcorn docks by way of the ship canal, the smaller vessels sailed up the Mersey and entered the docks through the locks. =Decline and recovery= From the opening of the ship canal there was a temporary improvement in trade for the Runcorn docks but a decline set in from the turn of the century. There was a short revival after the First World War but this was not maintained. Improvements were made to Bridgewater Docks in 1935 but this was unsuccessful. By 1950 the docks were \\"virtually moribund\\". At Runcorn docks trade declined from 124,428 tons in 1925 to 32,881 tons in 1951, and at Weston Point dock from 200,000 tons in 1938 to 40,000 tons in 1954. The old line of locks from the Bridgewater Canal became disused in the late 1930s, they were closed under the Ship Canal Act of 1949 and filled in. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure of the new line of locks, the old dock area and the Francis and Arnold Docks. The Runcorn and Weston Canal has been filled in to provide additional quay space for modern docks and the old warehouses have been demolished. However, with the building of the Silver Jubilee Bridge in 1961 communications to the docks have been improved and trade has begun to recover again. The dock entrance has been widened and the docks deepened. Trade increased from 50,000 tons in 1957 to 773,000 tons in 1973. In the month of December 2014 the Docks saw 50,126 tons of cargo in trade, the highest monthly tonnage recorded in the last quarter of a century.\\"Runcorn Docks records best shipping figures for 25 years\\" Runcorn and Widnes Weekly News, 22 January 2015. Accessed: 23 January 2015. Present day The site now contains two ports, Runcorn Docks and the Port of Weston. =Runcorn Docks= Runcorn Docks is owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company which is now part of the Peel Ports Group. It now comprises Francis Dock, Alfred Dock and Fenton Dock. It can take ships with cargoes up to 5000 tonnes with a maximum length of 350 feet (107m) and maximum draught of 7 metres. The adjacent canal lay-by has a deepwater berth of 168m. It has pipelines handling chemical and other liquid cargoes connecting to adjacent storage facilities and to the Ineos Chlor network. =Port of Weston= In August 2007 the owners of the Port of Weston, The Westbury Property Fund, merged with the Eddie Stobart Group to form the Stobart Group. This group plans to develop the site into an inter-modal port facility to enable freight, currently carried by road, to be transported by rail and water. This will mean increased warehousing, new container handling facilities, an extension to the existing West Coast Main Line rail siding, a new link road, and improved navigable access between the dock and the Manchester Ship Canal.

His final game as a professional was on November 14, 2009, when his Fire team lost on penalties to Real Salt Lake in the 2009 MLS Cup Eastern Conference playoff final. Career =College= Prideaux played college soccer for the University of Washington from 1994 to 1997. After his MLS career, he returned to his alma- mater where he is currently the assistant coach. His coaching style is known for taking examples of himself and his experience in the MLS. =Professional= Upon graduating in 1998, Prideaux joined the Seattle Sounders of the A-League. He excelled for the Sounders, registering two goals and ten assists while leading the team in minutes played. Prideaux's performance in the A-League attracted the attention of MLS, and he signed with the Kansas City Wizards for the 1999 season; he played in 15 games, starting 8, registering one assist. In his second year with the Wizards, Prideaux seized a starting role, starting all 31 of the games he played in, and helped lead the Wizards to an MLS Cup, playing a part in one of the best defenses in the league's history. Prideaux played with the Wizards one more season, before being traded to D.C. United for Stephen Armstrong prior to the 2002 season. Prideaux started 53 of 55 games he played for D.C. in 2002 and 2003, but had his starting position challenged in 2004 with the emergence of Josh Gros, and a tactical shift that led the team to play a 3-5-2 formation more often. Nevertheless, he started 16 games, and was a useful role player for the club. In 2005, he resumed his regular role, starting 28 of 29 games, but served primarily as a backup in 2006, playing in only 9 matches after suffering a knee injury. While in D.C., Prideaux coached the NCSL division 1 Arlington Warriors, and led them to great success in Metro area league.

Typically the dock is entered at high tide. As the tide ebbs a sill or weir prevents the level dropping below a certain point, meaning that the ships in the dock remain afloat, although they still rise and fall with the tides above this. Half tide docks are particularly useful in areas with a large tidal range. The sill of a half tide dock must be set sufficiently far below the daily high tide mark to allow ships to pass over it. Obviously this was easier to achieve with small ships of shallow draught, or in areas with a large tidal range. Inside the dock, the depth of water beneath the sill's level depends only on the depth to which the dock was excavated, although this obviously increases construction costs. The importance of the sill, and the tide's height above it, is reflected by these dock sills becoming an important local datum level and for tide tables being calculated for heights above it (i.e. clear draught in and out of the dock). This importance has often continued for many years after the original sill had been replaced, as at Sharpness on the Severn Estuary, or where the dock had disappeared entirely, such as Old Dock Sill in Liverpool.

Life Born Joseph Hammer in Graz, Styria (now Austria), he received his early education mainly in Vienna. Entering the diplomatic service in 1796, he was appointed in 1799 to a position in the Austrian embassy in Istanbul, and in this capacity he took part in the expedition under Admiral William Sidney Smith and General John Hely-Hutchinson against France. In 1807 he returned home from the East, after which he was made a privy councillor. In 1824 he was knighted (Chevalier). For fifty years Hammer-Purgstall wrote prolifically on the most diverse subjects and published numerous texts and translations of Arabic, Persian and Turkish authors. He was the first to publish a complete translation of the divan of Hafez into a western language. By traversing so large a field, he laid himself open to the criticism of specialists, and he was severely handled by Heinrich Friedrich von Diez (1751‚Äì1817), who, in his Unfug und Betrug in der morgenl√§ndischen Litteratur, nebst vielen hundert Proben von der groben Unwissenheit des H. v. Hammer zu Wien in Sprachen und Wissenschaften (1815), devoted to him nearly 600 pages of abuse. He also came into friendly conflict on the subject of the origin of The Thousand and One Nights with his younger English contemporary Edward William Lane. Medal Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall 1847 Hammer-Purgstall supported the foundation of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna and became the Academy's first president (1847‚Äì1849). The Austrian Oriental Society, founded in 1959 to foster cultural relations with the Near East, is formally named '√ñsterreichische Orient-Gesellschaft Hammer-Purgstall' in recognition of Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall's accomplishments.

Those in favour of the motion however, defended it as ensuring \\"women's rights\\" on campus. This vote was reversed in December 2012. =Shinerama cystic fibrosis fundraising controversy= In November 2008, the CUSA voted to drop its annual Shinerama cystic fibrosis fundraiser, in favour of a fundraiser for an as-yet- undetermined charity, because the illness is not \\"inclusive\\" enough. Shinerama is a fundraiser held at universities across Canada every fall in support of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF), first held in 1961; Carleton has participated for the past 25 years and has contributed nearly $1 million to the cause.President's message regarding recent decision by CUSA, Carleton University press release, November 26, 2008 Donnie Northrup, CUSA councillor representing the Faculty of Science, introduced the motion which stated that cystic fibrosis \\"has been recently revealed to only affect white people, and primarily men\\" and that therefore, it was inappropriate for the CUSA to donate money to researching a cure. Supporters of the motion argued that \\"all orientees and volunteers should feel like their fundraising efforts will serve the their (sic) diverse communities.\\"Cystic fibrosis not 'inclusive' enough for Carleton students , Canwest News, November 25, 2008.Text of the Carleton student union motion, reprinted by the National Post, November 25, 2008. Reactions and Criticism The CUSA was criticized for this decision since the motion did not reveal the source of the claim that cystic fibrosis affects only Caucasians. In fact, the CCFF's website states that: \\"The disease is most common in caucasians, but it can affect all races.\\" Nick Bergamini, a CUSA council member who represents Journalism students, stated that \\"They're playing racial politics with something that is supposed to bring people together ‚Äì a charity.\\" Bergamini commented that \\"they see this, in their own twisted way, as a win for diversity. I see it as a loss for people with cystic fibrosis.\\"Ottawa university boots cystic fibrosis from charity drive by Joanne Laucius, Canwest News Service (reprinted by the National Post), November 25, 2008. Cathleen Morrison, who is the CEO of the CCFF, stated in an interview with CTV News that although cystic fibrosis \\"does affect Caucasian populations primarily,\\" the term Caucasian includes people from South Asia, North Africa, the Persian Gulf and Israel. Morrison explained that \\"These are Caucasian populations. These people do not have white skin. They have CF, it now seems, in the same ratios as other Caucasian people who do have white skin.\\" Morrison also stated that cystic fibrosis affects just as many young girls as boys.Carleton student group votes to end Shinerama campaign, CTV News, November 25, 2008. Jonathan Kay, a columnist for the National Post, blasted CUSA for this decision. Kay stated that \\"Even by the loopy standards of students governments, this has got to be a new low.\\" Kay argued that cystic fibrosis, although it has a much higher rate of occurrence in caucasian males, affects all races and both genders. Kay also pointed out that many charity events raise money for breast cancer, even though it is primarily a female disease, and for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, whose sufferers are almost exclusively Jewish.Jonathan Kay on cystic fibrosis, and the disgrace of Carleton University's Students‚Äô Association by Jonathan Kay, National Post, November 25, 2008. Editorial and opinion articles from the Ottawa Citizen have also condemned CUSA's actions with the editorial declaring that \\"when [a student association] does something as ignorant and thoughtless as Carleton University's did this week, the country pays attention.\\" Subsequent response by CUSA CUSA president Brittany Smyth later stated that the council has been considering rotating the beneficiary of Shinerama instead of always giving the money to one charity, arguing that \\"It's about people wanting to do something different.\\" Smyth said the colour of someone's skin wasn't at issue; rather, the decision was made to spread the university's fundraising efforts to other charities. In an interview with CTV news, Smyth stated that \\"There was some discussion about that issue but very small. Most of it was around just switching it up and doing something different for a change.\\" CUSA released a statement on November 26 indicating that the association's council would revisit their decision. Smyth stated, \\"It has become clear that there is not an appetite at Carleton to change from [Shinerama]... The responsible thing to do is to reverse the decision,\\" adding that \\"the motion was never meant to imply that raising funds for Cystic Fibrosis research was not a worthwhile cause.\\"Carleton University Students' Association moves to reverse decision on Shine-A-Rama, press release, November 26, 2008 Smyth announced an emergency meeting of CUSA's council to vote on a new motion to reinstate the charity.Carleton students move to reinstate cystic fibrosis fundraiser by Katie Daubs, Canwest News Service (reprinted by the National Post), November 26, 2008. A unanimous vote at that meeting revoked the earlier decision, approved the restoration of next year's Shinerama campaign and also approved the publication of an apology over the matter. Donnie Northrup, the council representative responsible for moving the original motion to cancel Shinerama, resigned his position at CUSA as did another councillor, Sean Maguire. However, over the summer of 2009 Northrup was acclaimed back into CUSA. The meeting also received petitions demanding the resignation of Smyth and certain other councillors, although no actions on these were immediately taken. =Disqualification of a President-Elect= On February 13, 2009 Bruce Kyereh-Addo of the Demand Better slate was found to be in violation of the Consolidated Electoral Code on multiple counts and subsequently disqualified.Constitutional Board Decision- Bruce Kyereh-Addo. .

Accessed 5 March 2009. = 2009 CFS referendum petition = During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, a group of students launched a petition to hold a referendum on possible disaffiliation of CUSA from the CFS. Stated reasoning for this referendum was to counter issues such as the claimed ineffectiveness of the CFS and interference in other university's unions. In a press release the petitioners stated that the CFS \\"made almost no gains as a lobby group in its 30 years of operation.\\" This was strongly denied by the CFS. After several weeks a counter petition was created to try to bar the issue from going to a university-wide vote, which was controversially spearheaded by several CUSA officials. Soon afterward CUSA officially endorsed the counter-petition by a vote of 17 in favour, 7 against and 9 abstaining. The motion also mandates that CUSA members must advocate in favour of the CFS. This has attracted more criticism toward CUSA by students who feel it should stay neutral and instead try to help students make an informed decision. The pro-referendum petition ended up garnering over 2300 signatures before its submission to the CFS offices in Toronto. Despite being hand-delivered by a Bailiff, the CFS have stated they did not receive the petition. A referendum at Carleton had previously been held in 1995, on the possibility of joining the newly formed Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA), that lost narrowly. =Disqualification of VP Student Services= In 2016, Ashley Courchene, a third year political science major, ran for Vice President Student Services under the slate Change. After winning the election by only 21 votes, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Matt Swain disqualified the Change slate due to an alleged infraction by the assistant campaign manager Ahmad Gitteh and presidential candidate Abdullah Jabber, which led to Ashley Courchene's disqualification. Mr. Courchene successfully appealed the disqualification to the Electoral Board. Your Carleton then successfully appealed to the Constitutional Board (which overrides the electoral board). Mr. Courchene then went to the Ontario Superior Court, which reinstated him to the position of VPSS. Neither CUSA nor Your Carleton appealed the court's decision.

The Student Federation of the University of Ottawa was a bilingual entity, and its French-language name and acronym (F√âUO) had equal standing. It was a not-for-profit organization, incorporated under the Corporations' Act of Ontario. On August 9, 2018, La Rotonde, the university's French-language newspaper, reported that the Ottawa Police Service was investigating members of the SFUO and its executive for fraud. Subsequently, on August 10, the university announced it was withholding their funding until an audit into the allegations could be completed. On September 25, 2018, the University of Ottawa provided the Federation with a 90-day notice of termination of their contract, citing insufficient progress and further allegations of workplace misconduct, internal conflict, and improper governance. The announcement noted that, as of December 24, 2018, the Federation would no longer be recognized as the official representative of students, and invited students who wished to establish successor organizations to come forward. A referendum was held in February 2019 to determine whether the SFUO would be reinstated as the official undergraduate student union, or whether a new organization - the University of Ottawa Students' Union (UOSU) - would take its place. On February 11, 2019, the University of Ottawa announced that the University of Ottawa Students' Union had won the referendum to become the official undergraduate student union. The SFUO offices closed on April 10, 2019. An equitable court receiver has been appointed to officially dissolve the federation.https://thefulcrum.ca/news/sfuo-officially-closes-its-doors Governance The highest governing body of the SFUO was the Board of Administration (BoA). The BoA was composed of 34 members: the six executive members, 25 faculty representatives, one special student representative, one international student representative, and one Indigenous student representative. All the executive and faculty representative positions were directly elected. The BoA met once a month. The second-highest governing body of the SFUO was the General Assembly (GA), which was open to all students. Quorum for the GA was set at 0.75% of the student population - about 240 students. Finances According to auditors Deloitte, the Student Federation collected $5,103,066 from all 36,068 registered students alone during the 2015 session. A breakdown of the SFUO levies (services, initiatives and more) can be found on the University of Ottawa's Registrar Page. The executives have a salary of $35,500, and also covers the cost of up to 2 courses per semester as well as cell phone costs. Businesses At the time of its dissolution, the SFUO owned four student-run businesses: =PIVIK= A convenience store located in the University Centre, which sold groceries and some school supplies. It also sold some hot food. =The Agora Bookstore= The Agora Bookstore was created in 1999 with the goal of providing cheaper textbooks.

Clubs The SFUO is home to over 250 cultural, religious, political/social justice, philanthropic/humanitarian, recreational and academic clubs on campus. The SFUO had subsidised clubs up to $1000 each year. This was increased to $2000 during the 2015-16 school year. During the 2016‚Äì17 school year, clubs had their funding cut entirely due to the SFUO's austerity measures.

It also aims to raise awareness of food security issues and attempt to break down the stigma surrounding food insecurity in Canada. =Foot Patrol= The SFUO Foot Patrol is a student-run volunteer-based safe walk service offered to all students and members of the university community. Foot Patrol volunteers pick up students and walk with them anywhere within a 45-minute walking radius around main and RGN campuses and ride on several OCTranspo routes. =International House= The SFUO International House is a service designed to respond to the cultural, social, academic, and economic needs of international students and the general student population at the University of Ottawa. =Peer Help Centre= The SFUO Peer Help Centre provides the student community with academic, personal, and social support, which is achieved through short-term peer consultation. The Peer Help Centre offers uOttawa students a comfortable place to turn to in a time of need. =Pride Centre= The SFUO Pride Centre strives to promote a culture of affirmation through sex- positivity, and celebrate diversity of gender, sex, and sexuality both on and off campus. It offers students with resources as well as organizing events such as the annual Pride Week. =Student Rights Centre= The SFUO Appeal Centre offers help and support to students who wish to appeal decisions made by the administration of the University of Ottawa. This free service also assists and guides students who wish to file a complaint against or to receive assistance in dealing with the University of Ottawa. =Sustainable Development Centre= The SFUO Sustainable Development Centre aims to minimize the ecological footprint of the school and to change the mindset of students about sustainability and the ecological crisis. The centre not only runs its own projects, but also acts as a resource and support centre for environmental and social justice groups on campus. =University of Ottawa Student Emergency Response Team (UOSERT)= UOSERT provides 24/7 volunteer medical emergency services during the fall and winter terms. =Women's Resource Centre= The SFUO Women's Resource Centre is an inclusive, non-judgmental, pro-choice, feminist drop-in space that supports community members to work together to challenge gender oppression. They offer resources, events and campaigns to challenge gender oppression.  Campaigns  = In My Skin = In My Skin is an anti-racism campaign launched by the SFUO that seeks to tackle and raise awareness on racial issues faced on campus by many students of colour, while effectively educating them on how to challenge racism. In My Skin is an active campaign that creates various types of events such as a self-expression campaign, where students post a picture of themselves with a sign written \\"In My Skin\\" with a short quote about how they are not defined by racism, discussion groups, panels, and spoken word poetry slams. Additionally, these events seek to be inclusive to student of colour. = Task Force Against Rape Culture = Task Force Against Rape Culture is a response campaign by the Student Federation and the Graduate Student Association, which seeks to address sexual violence occurring at the University of Ottawa. Rape culture is defined as the social attitude that allows for rape to be normalized, trivialized, and even celebrated in some cases. This campaign attempts to challenge and fight sexism, misogyny and other forms of sexual violence experienced, on and off campus at the University of Ottawa, to effectively end rape culture. = Fossil Free uOttawa = Fossil Free uOttawa is an active campaign that promotes the negative impact of fossil fuel companies. Fossil Free uOttawa seeks to divest University of Ottawa from the very destructive fossil fuel industry by urging the Board of Governors to address the threat of climate change. = The 5 Demands: Decolonize uOttawa = The 5 Demands for the decolonization of the University of Ottawa is a collaborative campaign between the Indigenous Students' Association (ISA), the Indigenous and Canadian Studies Students' Association (ICSSA), and the Student Federation. The campaign lists 5 specific demands. The first demand is requesting the university to teach the Algonquin language for an undergraduate credit once every academic year. The second demand is seeking to increase Indigenous scholarships. The third demand is asking to create an Indigenous portal on the university's website. The fourth demand seeks for the university to recognize the Algonquin Nation throughout the physical landscape of the university. The final demand consists of three parts, part A demands the use of Aboriginal be replaced by Indigenous in all uses associated with the Aboriginal Studies Program; part B seeks to review the Aboriginal Studies Program in order to improve the French language offerings; part C requests that at least one course per semester be specifically related to the culture, history, politics, and spirituality of the Algonquin Nation. = Generation Vote = The Generation to Vote is a campaign that encourages young people to vote with the goal of putting students' needs on government agendas. This campaign was launched in spring 2014 before the Ontario provincial election by the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario. The objective was to call on the province's political parties to take action on issues relevant to youth and students. Some issues advocated were lower tuition fees, end illegal college and university ancillary fees, extend OHIP health coverage to international students, end unpaid internships, and improve access to public transit for students. = The Hikes Stop Here = The Hikes Stop Here campaign was launched in 2013 in response to the announcement of the Ontario provincial tuition framework. The framework allows tuition to increase annually up to three percent for most general programs and up to five percent for high demand and graduate levels programs. There is also no regulation for international students tuition fees in the framework. The Campaign focuses on advocating to the Ontario government that they must take action by cancelling the current framework and address the rising cost of tuition. The campaign demands that tuition fees be reduced by 30 percent for all students and that a long-term plan be installed to publicly fund college and university education. = Education is a Right = The Education is a Right campaign is based on the idea that public education in Canada is a basic right for all. The campaign advocates for a Canadian system of post secondary education be accessible to everyone and be of high quality. The goals of the campaign are the implementation of the national post-secondary education act, to dedicate federal funding for post-secondary education, to restore the federal funds to account for the underfunding in the past decades and to expand the non- repayable grants in order to eliminate student loans. The campaign also addresses the obstacles that graduate, international and Aboriginal students face. = No Means No = The No Means No campaign is an effort to end rape and sexual violence in communities and on university campuses. This campaign raises awareness about sexual violence, rape, and promotes consent and encourages students to be active and prevent sexual violence. The campaign, developed over two decades ago aims to change the culture surrounding acquaintance rape and dating violence in Canada. Through public education the campaign helps people understand their rights and responsibilities in sexual relationships. Canadian Federation of Students affiliation The SFUO is Local 41 of the Canadian Federation of Students, the same local number it held from 1985 to 1994. In the summer of 2008, a committee was formed to create a report on national student organizations and their benefits. The vast majority of this report was about the Canadian Federation of Students. Consequently, the SFUO Board of Administration voted in favor of becoming prospective members of the Canadian Federation of Students. Later, in November 2008, the SFUO joined the Canadian Federation of Students in a referendum question that brought out 22% of the voting population. Approximately 52% of those who voted in this election were in favour of the referendum. Elections Elections for the SFUO executive and Board of Administration are held annually in February. At that time, all 6 executive positions and 25 faculty representative positions are elected. The elections for the undergraduate Board of Governors representatives and the University Senate student representatives are also held at the same time. SFUO elections are conducted using the first-past-the- post system, and students vote using paper ballots at polling stations across campus. The SFUO elections office is headed by the Chief Electoral Officer, appointed by the BoA's Elections Committee and then ratified by the BoA. No members of the SFUO, BoA or executive are allowed to do any work for the elections office. Voter turnout has generally averaged around 11‚Äì12% in the last couple decades, the notable exception being 2009 and 2010, where voter turnout was over 20% both years as the SFUO used online voting. The record-low voter turnout was 5.7% in 1993. General Assemblies General Assemblies existed since the incorporation of the SFUO in 1969, yet during the 20th century they were only used as emergency measures and in the 1990s General Assemblies fell out of use. In November 2013, a referendum calling for the creation of the General Assembly (GA) of the SFUO failed, having not met the minimum turnout requirement of 4%, despite the yes receiving 84% of the vote. Several students opposed the creation of the GA, citing cost concerns, as well as concerns that the GA quorum of 1% would not be properly representative of the student population. The petition for the referendum was launched by the Marxist Students' Association. A second referendum was held along with the General Elections in 2014, and passed, bringing back General Assemblies after about twenty years of absence. The first SFUO General Assembly of the 21st century was held in November 2014. It failed to meet quorum and all the motions presented were later approved by the BoA, except for the motion calling for the SFUO to study the possibility of a strike. That motion was tabled indefinitely by the BoA in the hope that it would presented again at the next GA. Because the GA never met quorum, it became a Q&A; period with the executive. That period was rather heated, with one student being quoted as saying that: \\"Instead of having a participatory democracy, we were just an audience and that was our feeling, we didn't feel empowered\\". Quorum has been met twice, once in 1980 in reaction to a large tuition increase that led to a resolution to be passed to implement a tuition boycott, and again in March 2017 when over 280 students showed up during the 2017 Winter General Assembly to repeal an executive pay raise of 18%.Rick Janson, The Fulcrum Vol 41, no 1, Sept. 2 1980.  Controversies  =\\"In My Skin\\" scandal= The Executives of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa planned an event called \\"In My Skin\\" to be held on March 4, 2014. The event sought to foster two conversations, according to its organizers: each group was to discuss the benefits and disadvantages that racialized and non-racialized students face in dealing with institutional racism. It was planned that students would be split into \\"breakout groups\\", where they would discuss discrimination and white privilege and then would regroup to discuss the issues as a whole. There was a major backlash from students who saw this event as segregation and \\"reverse racism\\" because it would split students into different rooms based on skin colours. The Facebook event and debate were shut down and Nicole Desnoyers, Vice President Equity, released a statement explaining that there was no intention of segregation and racism on the part of the SFUO. = Fireworks scandal = In summer 2014, VP Social Ikram Hamoud decided to hold a fireworks display at the closing ceremony of that year's 101 Week. To that end, the SFUO purchased 10,000 dollars worth of fireworks. Hamoud was then notified by the City of Ottawa that they wouldn't be able to use the fireworks due to safety concerns. This caused a lot of controversy. Several of the Federated Bodies VP Socials accused Hamoud of failing to work with the Social Round Table. This, as well as concerns about the VP Social's job performance, led to an attempt at launching an impeachment referendum. In part because of its vocal criticism of the purchase, the Facebook group SFUO Does Not Represent Me gained substantial popularity. The 2014 101 Week finished with a budget deficit of almost $80,000. = Crashing of ARC opening ceremony = A group of students, led by several members of the executive, crashed the opening ceremony of the Advanced Research Complex (ARC) in September 2014. The group stood behind the podium with a banner calling for lower tuition fees, and the VP University Affairs interrupted [Reza Moridi]'s speech to read a statement. This protest drew criticism from many students, including several executive members of the Science Students' Association, who wrote a letter to the Fulcrum stating that: \\"The fact that the 'student representative' felt it necessary to protest rising tuition fees on the opening of (Dr. Andr√© Lalonde's) building is offensive to many of us. We feel that it is not only disrespectful to his memory and his legacy as a student-oriented dean, but also because this building should be celebrated for what it is, instead of criticised for what it is not.\\"\\"Letter to the editor\\" The Fulcrum. Volume 75, issue 8. 9 October 2014. = Yoga as cultural appropriation = In November 2015, the SFUO cancelled the free yoga classes being put on by the Centre for Students with Disabilities over concerns of cultural appropriation. The news provoked a large backlash from students, and received coverage by international media. The free class was subsequently reinstated with the hiring of an Indian- Canadian instructor. \\"Cultural issues\\" were the primary concern cited in an email from the University of Ottawa's Centre for Students with Disabilities, run by the SFUO, to the Ottawa Sun. \\"While yoga is a really great idea and accessible and great for students ... there are cultural issues of implication involved in the practice. [Some cultures] have experienced oppression, cultural genocide and diasporas due to colonialism and western supremacy ... we need to be mindful of this and how we express ourselves while practising yoga.\\" Less than a week later, the Sun reported that the SFUO had changed course and issued a statement attributing declining attendance and a need to \\"ensure that students' money and resources was being used in a responsible and efficient way,\\" as the reason for the cancellation. = Allegations of executives illegally obtaining U-Passes = U-Passes are Ottawa-Gatineau area public transportation passes that students are required to buy into as part of their membership of the SFUO if they qualify. To be eligible, a uOttawa student must be a full-time undergraduate or graduate student. Students are able to opt out under certain criteria, such as living outside of the public transit service area. In early 2017 allegations were made that the SFUO executives, who cannot qualify for the U-Passes because they must be part-time students, had obtained and were using U-Passes. Complaints were made against VP social Hadi Wess, VP university affairs Vanessa Dorimain, VP finance Rizki Rachiq, and VP equity Morissa Ellis. They were investigated by the BoA Disciplinary Committee, which found that indeed Wess, Dorimain, and Ellis had obtained U-Passes. Ellis had obtained the U-Pass by registering for five classes, which contravened with the SFUO constitution on the maximum course load for executives. She later dropped the excess classes to become a part- time student, but did not return the U-Pass as required. Dorimain was found to not qualify for a U-Pass, but as part of her role she worked on the U-Pass portfolio and had access to U-Passes that were not distributed due to \\"errors\\". Wess was found to be \\"qualified\\" for the U-Pass but the disciplinary committee did not disclose how. He was a part-time student and part-time students do not qualify. During the BoA meeting at the Roger Guindon Campus on April 2, 2017, the Faculty of Medicine representative Lukas Hashem asked for clarification as to how Wess could qualify but no answer was given. The disciplinary committee did not recommend sanctions against those involved. = 18% exec pay raise, stripping of General Assembly legislative power = In February 2017, the SFUO began discussion about raising executive salaries from $33500 to $39700, an increase of 18%, despite the poor financial condition and bankruptcy of the student union in 2016. Students criticized continual lack of funding to clubs, the low wages of other SFUO employees, and accused SFUO executives of conflict of interest. Despite widespread online controversy of the proposal, it was passed, with SFUO executives citing making less than other university student federation executives and dependent children as reasons for the raise. On March 14, the Winter 2017 general assembly met quorum for the first time since 1980, with over 280 students showing up to repeal the executives' pay raise. After the motion passed, with the added condition that execs not be allowed to raise their own salaries any more than what other SFUO workers' salaries have been raised, some members of the executive claimed that the legislative power of the GA had been stripped previously and any motion passed would still have to be passed by the Board of Administration. Students argued that they could not trust the BoA to make decisions for them that reflected what had happened during the GA, and expressed worry that BoA meetings are not recorded or made available to the public. After further review, it was clarified that since the decision to repeal the pay raise did not affect bylaws or constitution, the decision of the GA was final. At the BoA meeting on April 2, 2017, the executive aimed to strip of the GA of its remaining powers, but several BoA members led by engineering representative Jeffrey Colin, special student representative David Gakwerere, and medicine representative Lukas Hashem managed to amend it so that the BoA would require a two thirds super majority to repeal motions passed at the GA. = Fraud allegations = In August 2018, allegations of fraud committed by SFUO executives and an SFUO employee surfaced with the online circulation of a police report filed by outgoing SFUO president, Hadi Wess. The police report outlines the discovery of purchases carried out by the president and the executive manager. As of August 10, 2018, the University of Ottawa issued a formal statement, announcing that it would take over the management of student levies until the results of a forensic audit were released. After learning of allegations of financial mismanagement involving members of the SFUO executive and a SFUO staff member, the university requested that the Federation conduct a forensic audit. At the same time, the university notified the SFUO that uOttawa would withhold the fees that it collects from students on behalf of the Federation, pending the outcome of the forensic audit and restored University confidence in the proper financial management of student fees. Measures have been put in place to ensure the continuity of financial operations until the results of the audit become available. Since then, the university has learned of additional allegations of improper governance, mismanagement, internal conflict and workplace misconduct within the SFUO. University representatives expressed the institution's growing concerns about these allegations in letters to, and in two meetings with, the SFUO executive. the university made it clear to the SFUO executive that it would be required to take steps to restore the university's confidence in the Federation's ability to responsibly conduct its internal affairs. the university has not been satisfied with the Federation's progress. The agreement between the university and the SFUO stipulates that either party may terminate the agreement by giving the other party three months' written notice. Therefore, on December 24, 2018, following termination of the agreement, the university will no longer recognize the SFUO as the exclusive association representing undergraduate students and will no longer collect fees from students on behalf of the Federation. On November 7, 2018, the SFUO released the completed audit from PwC to the public. On November 8, 2018 the University of Ottawa responded by sending an email to students indicating the report \\"has not restored the university's confidence in the SFUO's ability to practice sound financial management.\\" They reiterated their intention to terminate the University of Ottawa-SFUO agreement.

His works, some of which have been filmed, include If He Hollers Let Him Go, published in 1945, and the Harlem Detective series of novels for which he is best known, set in the 1950s and early 1960s and featuring two black policemen called Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson. In 1958 Himes won France's Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re. Life = Early life = Chester Himes was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, on July 29, 1909, to Joseph Sandy Himes and Estelle Bomar Himes; his father was a peripatetic black college professor of industrial trades and his mother was a teacher at Scotia Seminary prior to marriage; Chester Himes grew up in a middle-class home in Missouri. When he was about 12 years old, his father took a teaching job in the Arkansas Delta at Branch Normal College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), and soon a tragedy took place that would profoundly shape Himes's view of race relations. He had misbehaved and his mother made him sit out a gunpowder demonstration that he and his brother, Joseph Jr., were supposed to conduct during a school assembly. Working alone, Joseph mixed the chemicals; they exploded in his face. Rushed to the nearest hospital, the blinded boy was refused treatment because of Jim Crow laws. \\"That one moment in my life hurt me as much as all the others put together,\\" Himes wrote in The Quality of Hurt. The family later settled in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents' marriage was unhappy and eventually ended in divorce. = Prison and literary beginnings = Himes's family left Pine Bluff and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended East High School. He attended Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, but was expelled for playing a prank. In late 1928 he was arrested and sentenced to jail and hard labor for 20 to 25 years for armed robbery and sent to Ohio Penitentiary. In prison, he wrote short stories and had them published in national magazines. He stated that writing in prison and being published was a way to earn respect from guards and fellow inmates, as well as to avoid violence. His first stories appeared in 1931 in The Bronzeman and, starting in 1934, in Esquire magazine. His story \\"To What Red Hell\\" (published in Esquire in 1934) as well as to his novel Cast the First Stone ‚Äì only much later republished unabridged as Yesterday Will Make You Cry (1998) ‚Äì dealt with the catastrophic prison fire Himes witnessed at Ohio Penitentiary in 1930. In 1934 Himes was transferred to London Prison Farm and in April 1936 was released on parole into his mother's custody. Following his release he worked at part-time jobs while continuing to write. During this period he came into contact with Langston Hughes, who facilitated Himes's contacts with the world of literature and publishing. In 1937 Himes married Jean Johnson.Lawrence P. Jackson, \\"A Little Hysterical: The Young Lives of Chester and Jean\\", Los Angeles Review of Books, August 8, 2015. = First books = In the 1940s Himes spent time in Los Angeles, working as a screenwriter but also producing two novels, If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945) and The Lonely Crusade (1947), which charted the experiences of the wave of black in-migrants, drawn by the city's defense industries, and their dealings with the established black community, fellow workers, unions and management. He also provided an analysis of the Zoot Suit Riots for The Crisis, the magazine of the NAACP. Mike Davis in City of Quartz: Excavating the Future of Los Angeles, describing the prevalence of racism in Hollywood in the 1940s and '50s, cites Himes' brief career as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers, terminated when Jack L. Warner heard about him and said: \\"I don't want no niggers on this lot.\\"Davis, Mike. City of Quartz (1990). Verso, 2006, p. 43. Himes later wrote in his autobiography: = Emigration to France = Himes separated from his wife Jean in 1952, and the following year he began a period of travels by boarding a ship to France. By the 1950s he had decided to settle permanently in France, a country he liked in part due to his popularity in literary circles. In Paris, Himes was the contemporary of the political cartoonist Oliver Harrington and fellow expatriate writers Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and William Gardner Smith. It was in Paris in the late 1950s that Chester met his second wife Lesley Packard, when she went to interview him. She was a journalist at the Herald Tribune, where she wrote her own fashion column, \\"Monica\\". He described her as \\"Irish-English with blue- gray eyes and very good looking\\"; he also saw her courage and resilience, Chester said to Lesley, \\"You're the only true color-blind person I've ever met in my life.\\" After he suffered a stroke, in 1959, Lesley quit her job and nursed him back to health. She cared for him for the rest of his life, and worked with him as his informal editor, proofreader, confidante and, as the director Van Peebles dubbed her, \\"his watchdog\\". After a long engagement, they were married in 1978. Lesley and Chester faced adversities as a mixed-race couple but they prevailed. Their circle of political colleagues and creative friends included not only such towering figures as Langston Hughes and Richard Wright; it also included figures such as Malcolm X, Carl Van Vechten, Picasso, Jean Miotte, Ollie Harrington, Nikki Giovanni and Ishmael Reed. Bohemian life in Paris would in turn lead them to the South of France and finally on to Spain, where they lived until Chester's death in 1984. = Later life and death = In 1969 Himes moved to Moraira, Spain, where he died in 1984 from Parkinson's disease. He is buried at Benissa cemetery.  Critical reception and biography  Part of a memorial to Himes in Moraira Some regard Chester Himes as the literary equal of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.Edward Margolies, \\"Which Way Did He Go? The Private Eye in Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Chester Himes, and Ross MacDonald\\" (Holmes & Meier, 1982). Via Questia. Ishmael Reed says: \\"[Himes] taught me the difference between a black detective and Sherlock Holmes\\" and it would be more than 30 years until another black mystery writer, Walter Mosley and his Easy Rawlins and Mouse series, had even a similar effect.Ishmael Reed by Spring, The Circle Association. In 1996, his widow Lesley Himes went to New York to work with Ed Margolies on the first biographical treatment of Himes's life, entitled The Several Lives of Chester Himes, by long-time Himes scholars Edward Margolies and Michel Fabre, published in 1997 by University Press of Mississippi. Later, novelist and Himes scholar James Sallis published a more deeply detailed biography of Himes called Chester Himes: A Life (2000).Busby, Margaret, \\"Do the Harlem shuffle\\", The Guardian, 21 October 2000. A detailed examination of Himes's writing and writings about him can be found in Chester Himes: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography compiled by Michel Fabre, Robert E. Skinner, and Lester Sullivan (Greenwood Press, 1992). In 2017, Lawrence P. Jackson published a significant, 600+ page biography of Himes titled Chester B. Himes: A Biography. Works Himes's novels encompassed many genres including the crime novel/mystery and political polemics, exploring racism in the United States. Chester Himes wrote about African Americans in general, especially in two books that are concerned with labor relations and African- American workplace issues. If He Hollers Let Him Go‚Äîwhich contains many autobiographical elements‚Äîis about a black shipyard worker in Los Angeles during World War II struggling against racism, as well as his own violent reactions to racism. Lonely Crusade is a longer work that examines some of the same issues. Cast the First Stone (1952) is based on Himes's experiences in prison. It was Himes's first novel but was not published until about ten years after it was written. One reason may have been Himes' unusually candid treatment ‚Äì for that time ‚Äì of a homosexual relationship. Originally written in the third person, it was rewritten in the first person in a more \\"hard- boiled\\" style. Yesterday Will Make You Cry (1993), published after Himes's death, restored the original manuscript. Himes also wrote a series of Harlem Detective novels featuring Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones, New York City police detectives in Harlem. The novels feature a mordant emotional timbre and a fatalistic approach to street situations. Funeral homes are often part of the story, and funeral director H. Exodus Clay is a recurring character in these books. The titles of the series include A Rage in Harlem, The Real Cool Killers, The Crazy Kill, All Shot Up, The Big Gold Dream, The Heat's On, Cotton Comes to Harlem, and Blind Man with a Pistol; all written between 1957 and 1969. Cotton Comes to Harlem was made into a movie in 1970, which was set in that time period, rather than the earlier period of the original book. A sequel, Come Back, Charleston Blue, was released in 1972, and For Love of Imabelle was made into a film under the title A Rage in Harlem in 1991. In May 2011, Penguin Modern Classics in London republished five of Himes' detective novels from the Harlem Cycle. =Novels and stories=   See The End of a Primitive, 1990. * Alternate titles: A Rage in Harlem (1985 Vintage Books, New York), The Five-cornered square.

Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, as a means of more natural biological filtration. Marine fishkeeping is different from its freshwater counterpart because of the fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants. Marine reef aquarium at the London aquarium  Marine fishkeeping history  The first saltwater tanks were Venetian glass jars where the Romans kept anemones outdoors, but these systems were very short lived. The Aztec Empire had 10 ponds of saltwater aquariums at Texcoco.Zoo and aquarium history: ancient animal collections to zoological gardens; N. Kisling, Vernon In 1846, Anna Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 35‚Äì36 Personal saltwater fishkeeping began on a wider scale in the 1950s, starting with the basic rectangular glass aquariums (usually 20 gallon), still popular today. Bleached coral along with a substrate of coarse crushed coral were the norm. Algae, including beneficial types such as coralline algae, were viewed negatively and were generally removed. The clean, sterile tank was viewed as the healthiest. During the early days of marine aquaria, saltwater was collected at local beaches. Natural saltwater contains many unwanted organisms and pollutants. Aquarium literature of the time suggests that the most commonly kept marine fish were the percula clownfish, sergeant major damselfish, small, brackish- water pufferfish and scats, jeweled blennies, and blue damsels. Aquariums were equipped with large air compressors, and were heavily aerated and filtered (primarily with undergravel filters, a norm for some time). An ever-growing number of hobbyists experiencing the inconvenience of gathering natural sea water and the concurrent development of analytical chemistry techniques led to research into the chemical composition of sea water. Synthetic salt mixes were developed to replicate the chemical environment of the tropical ocean, including trace elements and salts. This advance made marine fishkeeping popular in areas without access to clean sea water. Air driven, counter- current protein skimmers and reliable submersible electric heaters were invented in Germany. Various advances in filtration included trickle and hang- on filters, both allowing a more natural equilibrium in the aquarium environment. The advancement of fluorescent lighting technologies to provide higher output, along with metal halide lighting, enabled the first reef tanks, making it possible to keep corals and other invertebrates without natural sunlight. More efficient chemical testing allowed aquarists to understand the chemical properties of aquariums. By the 1980s, a biologically-based understanding of how to maintain an artificial ocean environment brought more successful and widespread marine fishkeeping.  Modern fishkeeping  = Marine aquarium components = 250px The major components are an aquarium, usually made from glass or acrylic, filtration equipment, lighting, and an aquarium heater. Marine aquariums can range in volume from less than 80 litres, (< 20 US gal) to over 1,200 litres (300 US gal). Small volumes are more difficult to maintain due to the more rapid changes in water chemistry. The majority of saltwater aquariums are between 160 and 400 litres (40 and 100 US gal). Nano reef aquarium maintained at home =Types of marine aquariums= Marine aquarists typically divide saltwater aquariums into those housing fish only, those housing fish with live rock, and those primarily designed to house corals and other invertebrates (also known as reef aquariums). Many fish hobbyists also divide the types of saltwater tanks based on the water temperatures at which they are kept. Tropical marine The most common type of saltwater fish tank, the tropical marine tank, houses marine animals from tropical climates. Usually kept between , these tanks include tropical reef tanks, as well as fish-only tanks. These tanks tend to have a low concentration of microscopic plankton and other foods eaten by filter feeders. Most livestock for these aquariums are acquired through commercial means. Temperate marine (coldwater marine) A temperate marine aquariumOne of the more obscure types of fish tanks, the coldwater marine tank, holds fish of temperate climates, with temperatures ranging around . Colorful species such as the ornate cowfish, blennies, and sea anemones can be found. The anemones and invertebrates in temperate waters easily rival their tropical counterparts. Most colorful species are found in the western Pacific and west coast of North America. Maintenance of these tanks is similar to keeping a fish only tank with live rock, or a non-photosynthetic tropical aquarium.http://reefbuilders.com/2013/07/10/shoreliner11s-temperate- reef/http://reefbuilders.com/2011/08/29/scandinavian-coldwater- reefs/http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2012/6/fishhttp://www.advancedaquarist.com/2011/1/coralshttp://www.advancedaquarist.com/2009/5/shorthttp://www.advancedaquarist.com/2009/4/howtohttp://www.advancedaquarist.com/2009/3/aquariumhttp://www.okeanosgroup.com/blog/aquariums/brrr- keeping-it-frosty-with-coldwater-reef- aquariums/http://www.nanfa.org/articles/acintertidal.shtml A significant diversity of species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather duster worms. A few corals can be found at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK.http://www.coldwatermarineaquatics.com/ The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose behavior patterns and tank compatibilities have been well documented in the last five or six decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them. Many temperate fish have specific local diet requirements, while others, will eat just about any crustacean or frozen foods. Some fish should not be kept with fish small enough to fit into its mouth, crabs or mollusks. Similarly some crabs can not be kept with some mollusks, while other fish, crabs, mollusks and echinoderms may be compatible with each other. It takes experience before one can successfully gauge the compatibility of the fish and invertebrates in one's area. Due to it being such a localized hobby in the United States, not many people go the route of local tanks which are far more popular in Europe. = Live rock = Live rock is rock that has been in the ocean, composed of limestone and decomposing coral skeleton, usually around a coral reef such as those around Fiji, and is usually covered with beneficial algae, coralline and tiny invertebrates and bacteria that are desirable in the aquarium. Some examples of the microfauna commonly found on live rock are crabs, snails, feather dusters, brittle stars, starfish, limpets, abalones, and an occasional sea urchin, sea anemone, coral, and sea sponge. Also, if the aquarist is unlucky, a mantis shrimp. Bristleworms are also common, most of which, while unattractive, are not harmful and are useful scavengers; some species can be pests, however. The addition of live rock is one of the best ways to ensure a healthy aquarium, as the rock provides a buffer to maintain high pH (8.0-8.3), alkalinity, and acid-neutralizing capacity. Alkalinity is often known by a rather confusing term, \\"carbonate hardness\\", or KH. This is usually measured in \\"degrees\\" (dKH) or meq/L. The microfauna found on live rock are detrivores and herbivores (as they eat algae and fish waste), and provide fish with a natural, attractive shelter. Live rock usually arrives from online dealers as \\"uncured\\", and must be quarantined in a separate tank while undergoing the curing process, which involves the inevitable die-off of some of the rock's inhabitants and the subsequent production of undesirable ammonia and nitrite. Live rock that is already cured is available at most pet stores that cater to saltwater. Live sand is similar to live rock and is equally desirable. Sometimes hobbyists use so-called \\"dry rock\\", which is simply old live rock that has been allowed to dry out and to lose most of its live inhabitants, to keep unwanted pests out of their aquariums, and as an inexpensive alternative to live rock. = Filtration = A new sump with three compartments including a protein skimmer In general, marine aquariums have more complex filtration requirements than most freshwater aquariums. The various components frequently include wet and dry filters and protein skimmers. Protein skimmers are devices that remove organic compounds prior to their degradation, and are very useful in marine aquariums. Protein skimming is also used in the popular Berlin method that relies on live rock and periodic partial water changes to degrade and remove waste products. The Berlin method requires large amounts of live rock in the aquarium. The rule of thumb is 1/2‚Äì1 lb. per 1 US gallon (0.2‚Äì0.4 kg per 4 liters). Many marine aquariums include a sump, which is an external container connected to the main aquarium with a water pump. In most setups, the sump is located below the aquarium and is fed water from the main tank via an overflow. An overflow at its simplest is a round hole drilled towards the top of the tank, connected via tubing to an output below it. As the water level increases past the height of the overflow (weir), the water \\"overflows\\" the tank and falls through to the sump below. It is typical to have tall combs on the overflow edge so fish do not jump inside. The water circulation is powered by a water pump in the sump, which pushes the water up into the tank, thus causing more water to flow over and perpetuating the cycle. There are many advantages to using a sump, both for the appearance and the health of the tank. The sump helps the appearance of the tank, because it allows filtration and maintenance equipment (protein skimmer, heater, activated carbon) to be kept out of sight of the main tank. It also ensures that the water level of the main aquarium never changes, as the overflow sets the water level in the main tank. The sump aids tank health by helping to oxygenate the water by increasing the amount of water/air surface area used for gas exchange. Some marine aquariums also include a refugium. Refugiums are small containers or aquariums that are hidden behind or beneath the main aquarium and connected to it via a water pump (often in a similar manner to a sump). Refugiums have recently become quite popular among reef aquarists because they can be used to serve several purposes such as adding water volume or providing a fish-free site for biological filtration in live rock and/or the sandbed. Fish-free refugiums host populations of copepods, amphipods, isopods, and other zooplankton. = Lighting = A DIY metal halide pendant lamp Regular cyclical lighting is used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them feel more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include but are not limited to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power. Natural sunlight The most primitive lighting source is natural sunlight. This is only effective in areas near the equator because the intensity of sunlight is greatest there. Efficiently utilizing natural sunlight requires complex planning and, as such, this method is applied on only the largest reef systems. Many times in the hobby natural sunlight is actually avoided due to the low spectrum of lighting it has. The yellow tint is often undesirable and is believed to encourage problem algae, though studies show it does not. Incandescent Incandescent lamps have been phased out over the years. They are wasteful of energy, producing between 15 and 30 lumens per watt of power (out of a possible 683 lumens per watt for an ideal light source). They can be found many times in older aquarium light hoods. They burn out frequently, put off a lot of heat, and normally do not have an appropriate spectrum associated with them. Most incandescent lamps can be replaced with commonly available and efficient screw in power compact bulbs. Standard fluorescent Standard fluorescent tubes are the common light bars you find in commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The downside to regular fluorescent lights is that they do not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums. Higher-output fluorescent There are several improved variations of fluorescent technology. The main ones are very high output (VHO), power compact fluorescent (PC), and T-5 high output (HO). VHO fluorescent lamps run at higher power levels, usually about three times the standard wattage for a given bulb length. They have the advantage of high light output, but the larger diameter bulbs limit the efficiency of reflectors and the number of bulbs that can be fit in an aquarium hood. PC lighting is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner and are often folded over one another to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power compact fluorescent bulbs. PC bulbs are recommended to be replaced every six months to a year to keep the desired light spectrum. T-5 HO lights are the newest variation on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, which allows for more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power compact fluorescent or VHO lighting fixtures. On the downside, T-5 lighting is the most expensive type fluorescent lighting available. Many times it is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent metal halide light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required. All types of fluorescent lighting offer the same efficiency in lumens per watt; it is the shape of the bulb and reflectors that makes their overall outputs different. Metal halide Metal halide lights are generally the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 lumens per watt of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This is often referred to as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even the very bottom levels of most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of metal halide lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced. Most metal halide fixtures are more expensive than fluorescent systems, but are required for some reef setups. Halide lamps concentrate heat as well as light output. The surface of an operating lamp becomes hot enough to cause second or third degree burns instantly, so this lighting technology must be used with caution. The heat produced can also warm the aquarium to unacceptable levels, possibly necessitating the use of a chiller for certain aquarium setups. LED The most recent addition to the list of aquarium lighting technologies is LED lighting. These have the potential to be much more efficient than any other technology, but are not fully developed. LEDs have the advantage of point source lighting, but are also adjustable to most power levels. This allows for more advanced lighting schedules, the simulation of cloud cover, or even lightning storms. So far, LEDs have found use mainly as lunar lighting in commercial products. Reef-keeping enthusiasts have begun to build their own LED light fixtures as well. Debate over their effectiveness towards coral is still inconclusive, particularly with respect to their ability to give off UV radiation, critical to obtaining a vibrant array of colors that most people interested in LED lighting are looking for.MagicJ, The Reefuge \\"DIY LED\\", The Reefuge, July 20, 2011. LED lighting can be considered one of the most energy efficient and low impact options to lighting a reef tank as well, with a projected life expectancy of seven years. LED lighting also helps replicate the natural look of sunlight because most LED lights produce shimmer lines like the ones found on natural reefs. The amount of emitters or LED fixtures can vary greatly based on these and other factors; photosynthetic specimens being kept, the input energy lost to heat, the PAR of light at a certain depth of aquarium water, and the light spectrum (PUR) used. Light spectrums that most closely duplicate nature are going to be most efficient. This includes blue light in spectrums approximately from 410 nm to 485 nm along with white (daylight) spectrums from 6500K to 14000K. Warm white emitters with the more yellow and green spectrums should be avoided. The results can be anywhere from .8 watt per gallon to 1.5 watt per gallon of an average depth aquarium.\\"PUR, PAS, PAR in Aquarium Reef/Planted Lighting\\", PUR, PAS, PAR in Aquarium Reef/Planted Lighting. Overall lighting considerations When considering lighting for an aquarium, there are generally two factors to consider: wattage and color temperature. Depending on the type of lighting (i.e. fluorescents, metal halide, etc.) the wattage of light emitted may vary considerably, from tens of watts to several hundred watts in a lighting system. Wattage, while not indicative of color, is equivalent to power and essentially determines how brightly the light will shine. Due to the scattering of light in water, the deeper one's tank is, the more powerful the lighting required. Color temperature, measured in kelvins (albeit slightly unrepresentively) refers to the color of light being emitted by the lamp and is based on the concept of blackbody radiation. Light from the sun has a color temperature of approximately 5900 K and lighting systems with color temperatures >5000 K tend to be best for growing plants in both the marine and freshwater setting. 10,000 K light appears bluish-white and emphasizes coloration in fishes and corals. Higher up on the spectrum there are 14,000 K and 20,000 K bulbs that produce a deep blue tint which mimic the lighting conditions underseas, creating an optimal ambience for invertebrates and livestock present. = Temperature control = Most marine aquarium inhabitants are endemic to tropical reefs and waters in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Red Sea. Marine aquarium temperatures should mimic the natural environment of the inhabitants and are most commonly maintained at . In regions where the ambient temperature is less than the desired temperature of the aquarium this generally necessitates the use of an aquarium heater. In some areas where ambient temperature is greater than the desired temperature, or for coldwater systems, refrigeration devices known as \\"chillers\\" are used to cool the aquarium water. = Water testing = Marine aquarists commonly test the water in the aquarium for a variety of chemical indicators of water quality. These include: * Specific gravity, a relative measure of water density, is normally maintained between 1.020 and 1.024 in aquariums with fish only, and 1.023 and 1.026 for aquariums containing invertebrates. * Salinity should therefore be between 28 and 35 ppt, with the higher values being beneficial in advanced reef systems. Because salinity is by definition directly related to specific gravity, both can be tested with an inexpensive hydrometer or refractometer. * pH should be maintained between 8.1 and 8.3. * Ammonia should be near zero. * Nitrite should be near zero. * Nitrate should be well below 10 ppm, but close to zero is best. * Phosphate should be below 0.3 ppm. * Alkalinity should be 3.2-4.5 meq/L. or 7 and 12 degrees of carbonate hardness (dKH).http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/coralidprofileresource/a/aa072704coralne.htm *Copper concentration should be measured and not rise over 0.15 ppm pH can be raised with a commercially available buffering agent or through calcium-rich substrates. A calibrated calcium reactor can assist in maintaining both pH and alkalinity. Using purified water from a reverse osmosis/deionization (RO/DI) unit can prevent KH and pH fluctuation. The nitrogen cycle refers to the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While fish waste (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into the water from the fishes' gills. Biological (bacterial) nitrification converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a \\"refugium.\\" A refugium is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. Refugiums usually contain a deep sand bed to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the refugium as another means of nitrate export. As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations. Other suggested tests include those for calcium, carbonate alkalinity, magnesium, and other trace elements. It is often beneficial (and necessary) for the aquarist to research the water chemistry parameters for the specific organism that is desired. = Acclimation = Acclimation is a process that is performed when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation. This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry. There are several different methods of doing this, including the use of a drip line, or of a measuring cup or other device to slowly mix water from the aquarium tank into a container with the new animal. The drip line or trickle acclimating method is a safe and gentle way to introduce saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure can be used to acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set on the floor next to the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/saltwaterfishdiseases/a/aaacclimatingdr.htm = Water changes = Water changes are a staple of good saltwater maintenance. Larger (approximately ) aquariums are much more stable and water changes may not need to take place if the nitrogen cycle has fully established itself in the tank, although this is a controversial statement among aquarists. Water changes are used to maintain balance of calcium, carbonate alkalinity, and magnesium which are rapidly depleted in a reef aquarium, while also maintaining levels of other trace elements as well as removing toxic solutes which may accumulate from many different sources and cannot be removed by even advanced filtration methods. Supplements are needed (such as calcium) when regular water changes alone are not able to maintain adequate levels, particularly those of calcium, carbonate, and magnesium. Water changes involve removing a fraction of the total volume of the aquarium, replacing that water with new pre-mixed saltwater. Pre-mixed saltwater has been dechlorinated and/or dechloraminated‚Äîtypically with an additive such as bisulfite or through filtering. Water should be brought to the same temperature if more than a 5% change is occurring. Salinity should match that of the aquarium, or be dosed very slowly if altering the salinity. Aging and aerating saltwater (such as in a bucket with a powerhead or airstone) is recommended as good practice to allow the pH to stabilize. Replacement water should be of the same source as the aquarium, whether it be reverse osmosis (RO), de-ionized (DI), distilled or from a municipal supply, in order to avoid drastic changes in water chemistry. In cases where one is replacing a tap water-based salt mix with a reverse osmosis-based salt mix, the replacement water should be added slowly over the course of several hours to avoid sending the aquarium inhabitants into osmotic shock. However, large water changes are not advised under routine circumstances anyway, so this is really irrelevant. Municipal, or tap water, is not recommended for a marine aquarium as it often contains high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates and other dissolved solids which fuel the growth of nuisance algaes, particularly diatoms, which appear as a rust- colored powdery algae and grows in the overabundance of silicates present in all tap water. Water filtered by a four-stage process including mechanical, carbon, reverse-osmosis, and de-ionizing components is recommended as this can provide the easiest route to absolutely pure water. Four- and five-stage RO/DI filtration units can be obtained for as little as $100 and are a cost- effective means of converting tap water into water usable in a marine aquarium.  Conservation  Almost all species kept in marine aquaria at this time are caught in the wild, although tank-raised specimens are becoming increasingly common as a viable alternative. Only a few species such as clownfish are captive-bred on a commercial scale. Much collecting is done in Indonesia and the Philippines, where use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods, while discouraged, is unfortunately common. The majority of live rock is also harvested in the wild, and recent restrictions on this harvest in Florida have caused a shift to Fijian and aquacultured rock. Natural rock, because it is created by coral polyps, takes many years if not centuries to form, and is a vital habitat for countless marine species; thus, commercial-scale harvesting of naturally occurring live rock has been criticized by conservationists. Additionally, many animal species sold to hobbyists have very specific dietary and habitat requirements that cannot be met by hobbyists (e.g. genus Labroides wrasses, the moorish idol); these animals almost inevitably die quickly and have markedly reduced lifespans compared to wild specimens. Often these specific environmental requirements cause improperly housed livestock's color and appearance to be poor. These issues are often downplayed by individuals and organizations with a financial interest in the trade. Hobbyists who support conservation should buy only certified net-caught fish (although ensuring the legitimacy of such claims can be difficult) or captive-raised fish, as well as farmed corals and to support legitimate reef conservation efforts. The majority of corals can be \\"fragged\\", whereby a portion of a larger captive coral is separated and can subsequently be raised into an individual specimen, allowing for coral propagation within the domestic aquarium; the trade in frags (i.e. fragments) offers a fantastic opportunity for marine aquarists to obtain new and unique corals while limiting the impact on the natural environment. Rare species and those without a history of being successfully kept in captivity should be avoided. = Commercial development = Various businesses have commercialized fishkeeping. With the advent of large scale business operations focusing on breeding massive quantities of specimens, marine fishkeeping has become much more widespread than ever before. Perhaps the biggest disincentive to marine fishkeeping, in comparison to freshwater, is the initial setup cost. A reef tank full of coral and equipment can cost in excess of $2,500 US, although a budget-minded home hobbyist could spend less than half of this and still get a satisfactory result.

Along with French comics, formerly the company published the official translations of products produced by DC Comics and Marvel Comics Today, Semic Publishes translations from others \\"Comics Factories\\" like Avatar Press, Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics and Top Cow Productions, among others.  History  = Editions Lug = In 1950, writer/editor Marcel Navarro and Auguste Vistel founded Editions Lug. At first, the company only reprinted old French and Italian comics. But soon, Navarro decided that his company needed some original characters. He enlisted a number of French and Italian studios to create new series. Although many of them invoked characters featured in American comics, they had enough differences to make them unique. In 1969, Editions Lug began publishing licensed translations of Marvel Comics in a magazine called Fantask. That year also saw the creation of Wampus. But French censorship forced Editions Lug to cancel both of these magazines after six issues. In the next two decades, Editions Lug continued to expand, thanks to its growing program of French editions of Marvel Comics, which began to include Conan the Barbarian. Many new magazines and series were added to their French line. A shared universe began to emerge, although not nearly as tightly integrated as the Marvel Universe. In the mid-1980s, Auguste Vistel died. Eventually, Marcel Navarro chose to retire. The company was sold to the Semic Group, a Scandinavian comic book publisher. = Semic Group / Semic S.A. = After Navarro's departure, the Semic Group continued to publish French editions of Marvel Comics, but discontinued the creation of original material. The half-dozen original Lug titles that remained became reprints-only. During the late 1990s, the Semic Group transferred all of its French business to Tournon, their French distributors. Tournon soon broke up from the Semic Group and created their own company, Semic S.A. In early 2004, after Semic had discontinued a line of comic books, a multinational group of writers and artists formed Hexagon Comics and reclaimed the rights to the characters they had created for √âditions Lug.

This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to breathe new life into a cherished old game, as a creative outlet, or to make essentially new unofficial games using the old game's engine. ROM hacking is generally accomplished through use of a hex editor (a program for editing non- textual data) and various specialized tools such as tile editors, and game- specific tools which are generally used for editing levels, items, and the like, although more advanced tools such as assemblers and debuggers are occasionally used. Once ready, they are usually distributed on the Internet for others to play on an emulator or games console. Fan translation (known as \\"translation hacking\\" within the ROM hacking community) is a type of ROM hacking; there are also anti-censorship hacks that exist to restore a game to its original state, which is often seen with older games that were imported, as publishers' content policies for video games (most notably, Nintendo's) were much stricter in the United States than Japan or Europe, there are also randomisers which shuffle entity placements. Although much of the method applies to both types of hacking, this article focuses on \\"creative hacking\\" such as editing game levels. Communities Most hacking groups offer web space for hosting hacks and screenshots (sometimes only hosting hacks by the group's members, sometimes hosting almost any hack), a message board, and often have an IRC channel. Methods Having been created by many different programmers or programming teams, ROM data can be very diverse. =Hex editing= A hex editor is one of the most fundamental tools in any ROM hacker's repertoire. Hex editors are usually used for editing text, and for editing other data for which the structure is known (for example, item properties), and Assembly hacking. Editing text is one of the most basic forms of hacking. Many games do not store their text in ASCII form, and because of this, some specialized hex editors have been developed, which can be told what byte values correspond to what letter(s) of the alphabet, to facilitate text editing; a file that defines these byte=letter relationships is called a \\"table\\" file. Other games use simple text compression techniques (such as byte pair encoding, also called dual tile encoding or DTE, in which certain combinations of two or more letters are encoded as one byte) which a suitably equipped hex editor can facilitate editing. A hex editor is the tool of choice for editing things such as character/item properties, if the structure and location of this data is known and there is no game-specific editor for the game that can edit this information. Some intrepid hackers also perform level editing with a hex editor, but this is extremely difficult (except on games whose level storage format closely resembles how it is presented in a hex editor). =Graphics editing= Another basic hacking skill is graphics hacking, which is changing the appearance of the game's environments, characters, fonts, or other such things. The format of graphics data varies from console to console, but most of the early ones (NES, Super NES, Game Boy, etc.) store graphics in tiles, which are 8x8-pixel units of data, which are arranged on-screen to produce the desired result. Editing these tiles is also possible with a hex editor, but is generally accomplished with a tile editor (such as Tile Layer or Tile Molester), which can display the ROM data in a graphical way, as well as finding and editing tiles. Graphics hacks can range from simple edits (such as giving Luigi a golf club, or making pixelated sprites for later generation Pokemon) to \\"porting\\" characters from one game to another, to full-blown thematic changes (usually with accompanying palette changes; see below). More sophisticated graphics hacking involves changing more than just tiles and colors, but also the way in which the tiles are arranged, or tile groups generated, giving more flexibility and control over the final appearance. This is accomplished through hex editing or a specialized tool (either for the specific game or a specific system). A good example of a graphics hack is the uncompleted Pok√©mon Torzach, a hack which attempted to add a whole new generation of Pok√©mon and tiles to the game. The hack has since been discontinued, but it still serves as a good example on what can be achieved with the tools available. =Palette editing= Another common form of hacking is palette hacking, where color values are modified to change the colors a player sees in the game (this often goes hand-in-hand with graphics hacking); Palette values are commonly stored in Hex. This is fairly easy for NES games, the graphics of which use a pre-defined set of colors among which a game selects; palette hacking in this case entails changing which of those colors are selected. The matter is slightly more complicated with Super NES games and games for other systems, which store absolute RGB color values. Palette editors are usually simple and often are with Level editors, or Game specific graphics editors. =Level editing= One of the most popular forms of ROM hacking, level editing entails modifying or redesigning a game's levels or maps. This is almost exclusively done with an editor specially tailored for a particular game (called a level editor). Level edits can be done to make the game more challenging, to alter the flow of the game's plot, or just to give something new to an old game. Combined with extensive graphics hacking, the game can take on a very different look and feel. =Data editing= A core component of many hacks (especially of role- playing video games) is editing data such as character, item, and enemy properties. This is usually done either \\"by hand\\" (with a hex editor) if the location and structure of the data is known, or with a game-specific editor that has this functionality. Through this, a hacker can alter how weapons work, how strong enemies are or how they act, etc. This can be done to make the game easier or harder, or to create new scenarios for the player to face. =Assembly hacking= The most powerful, and arguably the most difficult, hacking technique is editing the game's actual code, a process called ASM hacking (\\"ASM\\" means \\"assembly\\", referring to the type of programming language used for early video games). There is no set pattern for ASM hacking, as the code varies widely from game to game, but most skilled ASM hackers either use an emulator equipped with a built-in debugger or tracer, or run the ROM through a disassembler, then analyze the code and modify it using a hex editor or assembler according to their needs. While quite challenging compared to the relatively simple methods listed above, anything is possible with ASM hacking (of course, within the limits of the hardware/software of the gaming platform), ranging from altering enemy AI to changing how graphics are generated. (Of course, the possibilities are still limited by the hacker's ability to comprehend and modify the existing code.) If the developers used a typed language, the hacker may be able to compile their own code for the game in the same language if they have access to a proper compiler. One such example would be using C to hack Nintendo 64 games, since MIPS-GCC can compile code for the Nintendo 64. =Music hacking= Music hacks are relatively rare, due to the wide variety of ways games store music data (hence the difficulty in locating and modifying this data) and the difficulties in composing new music (or porting music from another game). As music cracking is very uncommon, many hacks do not have any ported/composed music added in. The program SapTapper can be used to hack Game Boy Advance music data, however, as many Game Boy Advance games use the M4A Engine (also called \\"Sappy Driver\\") for music. Various other utilities were created to work with the engine such as Sappy 2006. Another instance of the same engine being used between games is on the Nintendo 64, in which most games use the same format; although they use different sound banks. A utility known as the N64 Midi Tool was created to edit the sequences that the majority of Nintendo 64 games use, though it does not cover the first-party N64 titles that use a slightly different engine, such as Super Mario 64. Several Mega Drive games use a sound engine unofficially known as \\"SMPS\\", which has been researched for decades by many hackers. As of today, various tools exist to alter the music of games which use the SMPS engine (Sonic the Hedgehog games in particular), and many of them made their way to the Steam Workshop. =ROM expansion= Generally speaking, a ROM hacker cannot normally add content to a game, but merely change existing content. This limit can be overcome through ROM expansion, whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased, making room for more content and, in turn, a larger game. The difficulty in doing this varies depending on the system for which the game was made. For example, expanding an NES ROM may be difficult or even impossible due to the mapper used by the game. For example, if a mapper allows 16 ROM banks and all of them are used, expanding the ROM further is impossible without somehow converting the game to another mapper, which could be easy or extremely difficult. On the other hand, expanding a SNES game is (relatively) straightforward. To utilize the added space, parts of the game code have to be modified or re-written (see Assembly hacking above) so the game knows where to look. Another type of ROM expansion that is fairly easy is Game Boy Advance ROMs. The ROMs themselves are generally small, but the memory space available sometimes exceeds it by multiples of up to 17. Distribution Once a hack is completed (or an incomplete version is deemed suitable for an interim release) it is released onto the Internet for others to play. The generally accepted way to do this is by making an unofficial patch (in IPS format or others) that can be applied to the unmodified ROM. This, and usually some form of documentation, is put in an archive file and uploaded somewhere. IPS is a format for recording the differences between two binary files (in this case, between the unmodified and hacked ROMs) and is suitable for ROM hacks. IPS is still used today for small patches‚Äîhowever, as ROMs became larger in size, this format became useless, leading to quite a few file formats being created‚Äîsuch as NINJA and PPF (\\"PlayStation Patch Format\\"). PPF is still used today, particularly to patch large files such as ISO CD images and Nintendo 64 games. A new patch format, UPS, has also been developed by the ROM hacking community, designed to be the successor to IPS and PPF. A more recent patching format, the APS patching system, has also been developed by a devoted Game Boy Advance ROM hacker. The APS system is more space efficient, is reversible, and is faster than its predecessor. The purpose of distributing a hack in patch form is to avoid the legal aspects of distributing entire ROM images; the patch records only what has changed in the ROM, hence distributing it does not usually distribute parts of the original game. A patch is also normally drastically smaller than the full ROM image (an NES ROM can run anywhere from 8 KB to 2 MB; a Super NES ROM can run from 256 kB to 6 MB). In a novel example of legal distribution, Sega released a Steam- based virtual hub for its previous collection of Mega Drive/Genesis games, entitled Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub. The Hub, besides allowing players to play emulated versions of these older games, takes advantage of Steam's support for user-created content through Steam Workshop, officially allowing ROM hacks of any of the offered classics. Usage Patched ROMs are often played on emulators, however it is also possible to play patched ROMs on the original hardware. The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled, or another compatible cartridge of the same type. This is particularly popular for fan translations, homebrew games, prototypes, or other games for which original cartridges were never produced, or for games which require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware which are not available in emulators. Systems and games The majority of ROM hacking is done on NES and Super NES games, since such games are small and simple compared to games of more advanced consoles such as the Nintendo 64 or Nintendo DS. Games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance are also popular for hacking, as well as games for the Sega Mega Drive and PlayStation to a lesser extent. Sega Genesis games are also widely hacked. But by no means are games for more recent consoles exempt from hacking, and indeed as computers have become faster and more programs and utilities have been written, more PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS hacks have emerged. Of these, popular games to play are popular games to hack; many hacks have been released of games of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, Super Mario series (including Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 64 and Super Mario World), Mario Kart series (most notably Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, and Mario Kart DS), Pok√©mon series, Chip's Challenge, Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda, games from the Mega Man series, Fire Emblem series, EarthBound, Super Metroid, and many others. A notable hacked arcade game was Street Fighter II Blackbelt Edition, which featured increased game speed and new special moves. The success of this game prompted Capcom to release Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting as an official response. Your Sinclair magazine published a monthly column called \\"Program Pitstop\\". This focused mainly on cheat hacks for games, but also featured both a level map printer for the original Gauntlet, as well as a full level editor for the same game.

He graduated from West Lafayette High School in 1979. Fukunaga attended Purdue University where he got his BSEE in 1982 and his MSEE in 1984. He later moved to Boca Raton, Florida to work as an engineer for IBM. He then attended Columbia Business School, obtaining an MBA in 1989. He held a position with Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) before getting a job with Tandem Computers in Sunnyvale, California. Fukunaga is also the co-founder and manager of EchoLight Studios, a Texas-based Christian television production company run by Rick Santorum. EchoLight initially shared office space with Fukunaga's Funimation. Originally, Toei Animation told Funimation that they could not have the Dragon Ball series. However, Fukunaga's uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was one of the producers for Toei Company and helped him convince Toei Animation to give the license to Funimation. So Fukunaga went to a coworker named Daniel Cocanougher, whose family owned a feed mill in Decatur, Texas, and convinced the Cocanougher family to sell their business and invest in creating a production company. With that, FUNimation Productions was established in 1994. In 2005, Funimation was acquired by the Navarre Corporation for US$100.4 million, Fukunaga still remained the company's CEO. In 2011, the company was sold to a group of investors which included Fukunaga himself.Navarre Sells Funimation to Group with Gen Fukunaga In 2017, Funimation was sold to Sony Pictures Television Networks for US$143 million.

Photo by C. Cameron Macauley. Anthony Evan Hecht (January 16, 1923 ‚Äì October 20, 2004) was an American poet. His work combined a deep interest in form with a passionate desire to confront the horrors of 20th century history, with the Second World War, in which he fought, and the Holocaust being recurrent themes in his work. Biography =Early years= Hecht was born in New York City to German- Jewish parents. He was educated at various schools in the city ‚Äì he was a classmate of Jack Kerouac at Horace Mann School ‚Äì but showed no great academic ability, something he would later refer to as \\"conspicuous\\". However, as a freshman English student at Bard College in New York he discovered the works of Wallace Stevens, W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, and Dylan Thomas. It was at this point that he decided he would become a poet. Hecht's parents were not happy at his plans and tried to discourage them, even getting family friend Ted Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, to attempt to dissuade him. In 1944, upon completing his final year at Bard, Hecht was drafted into the 97th Infantry Division and was sent to the battlefields in Europe.Jonathan Post, The Selected Letters of Anthony Hecht, The Johns Hopkins University Press; Nov 27, 2012. He saw combat in Germany in the \\"Ruhr Pocket\\" and in Cheb in Czechoslovakia. However, his most significant experience occurred on April 23, 1945, when Hecht's division helped liberate Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. Hecht was ordered to interview French prisoners in the hope of gathering evidence on the camp's commanders. Years later, Hecht said of this experience, > The place, the suffering, the prisoners' accounts were beyond comprehension. > For years after I would wake shrieking. =Career= After the war ended, Hecht was sent to Occupied Japan, where he became a staff writer with Stars and Stripes.Geoffrey Lindsay, \\"Anthony Hecht in Occupied Japan.\\" Sewanee Review, 2011, 119 (4). pp 641‚Äì655. He returned to the US in March 1946 and immediately took advantage of the G.I. bill to study under the poet-critic John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College, Ohio. Here he came into contact with fellow poets such as Randall Jarrell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Allen Tate. He later received his master's degree from Columbia University. In 1947 Hecht attended the University of Iowa and taught in the Iowa Writers' Workshop, together with writer Robie Macauley, with whom Hecht had served during World War II,Kennedy, Thomas E., \\"A Last Conversation with Robie Macauley,\\" Agnii, Vol. 45, 1997. but, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his war service, gave it up swiftly to enter psychoanalysis.Anthony Hecht, obituary Hecht's grave at Bard College Cemetery in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York In spring, 1947, he taught at Kenyon. His first poems, \\"Once Removed\\" and \\"To a Soldier Killed in Germany\\", were published in The Kenyon Review. Later that year, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned to his parent's home in New York City and entered psychoanalysis. In 1948, his poems begin to appear in The Hudson Review, Poetry, and Furioso. He later won the Furioso Poetry Award and enrolled at Columbia University as a candidate for a master's degree in English literature.Anthony Hecht, Selected Poems. Borzoi poetry, J. D. McClatchy, ed. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011. Hecht released his first collection, A Summoning of Stones, in 1954. Even at this stage Hecht's poetry was often compared with that of W. H. Auden, with whom Hecht had become friends in 1951 during a holiday on the Italian island of Ischia, where Auden spent each summer. In 1993 Hecht published The Hidden Law, a critical reading of Auden's body of work. In his second book, The Hard Hours, Hecht first addressed his own experiences of World War II ‚Äì memories that had caused him to have a nervous breakdown in 1959.Philip Hoy, Anthony Hecht in Conversation with Philip Hoy. London: Between the Lines, 2004. Hecht spent three months in hospital following his breakdown, although he was spared electric shock therapy, unlike Sylvia Plath, whom he had encountered while teaching at Smith College. Hecht's main source of income was as a teacher of poetry, most notably at the University of Rochester, where he taught from 1967 to 1985. He also spent varying lengths of time teaching at other notable institutions such as Smith, Bard, Harvard, Georgetown, and Yale. Between 1982 and 1984, he held the esteemed position of Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Hecht won a number of literary awards including: the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (for The Hard Hours), the 1983 Bollingen Prize, the 1988 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the 1989 Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry, the 1997 Wallace Stevens Award, the 1999/2000 Frost Medal, and the Tanning Prize. Hecht died on October 20, 2004, at his home in Washington, D. C.; he is buried at the cemetery at Bard College. One month later, on November 17, Hecht was awarded the National Medal of Arts, accepted on his behalf by his wife, Helen Hecht.National Endowment for the Arts ‚Äì 2004 National Medal of Arts The Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize is awarded annually by the Waywiser Press.The Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize Literary style, inspirations, and themes Hecht is known for his masterful use of traditional forms and linguistic control. Extraordinarily erudite, his verse often features allusions to French literature, Greek myth, and tragedy, and English poets and poetry stretching from Wallace Stevens to John Donne. He is often described as a \\"traditionalist\\". In The Hard Hours (1967), Hecht begins to use his experiences as a soldier in Europe during World War II.

Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on PerseusœÄŒ±·ø¶œÉŒπœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, on Perseus) is the hiatus between prosodic declination units. The concept is somewhat broad, as it is primarily used to refer to allophones that occur in certain prosodic environments, and these environments vary between languages. Characteristics Some sound laws specifically operate only in pausa. For example, certain phonemes may be pronounced differently at the beginning or the end of a word if no other word precedes or follows within the same prosodic unit, such as a word in the citation form. That is the case with the final-obstruent devoicing of German, Turkish, Russian, and other languages whose voiced obstruent consonants are devoiced pre-pausa and before voiceless consonants. The opposite environment is relevant in Spanish, whose voiced fricatives become stops post-pausa and after nasals. Such environments are often termed pre-pausal and post-pausal, respectively. The phrases in pausa and pausal form are often taken to mean at the end of a prosodic unit, in pre-pausal position, as pre-pausal effects are more common than post-pausal effects. Very commonly, such allophones are described as occurring \\"word-initially\\" or \\"word-finally\\", as opposed to other allophones found \\"word-medially\\", because that is a more accessible phrasing for most readers. However, that phrasing is accurate only for a word in citation form. It is not always clear in the description of a language whether an alleged word-boundary allophone is actually defined by the word boundary, as opposed to being pausal allophones being defined by prosodic boundaries. Examples In English, the last stressed syllable before a pausa receives tonic stress, giving the illusion of a distinction between primary and secondary stress. In dialects of English with linking or intrusive R (a type of liaison), the r is not realized in pausa even if the following word begins in a vowel. Similarly, French liaison does not operate in pausa. English words that have weak and strong forms are realized as strong after and often also before a pausa. In Arabic, Biblical Hebrew, other Semitic languages, and Egyptian, pausa affects grammatical inflections. In Arabic, short vowels, including those carrying case, are dropped before a pausa, and the gender is modified. The Arabic alphabet has a letter (tƒÅ æ marb≈´·π≠a ) for the feminine, which is classically pronounced in pausa but in liaison. In Biblical Hebrew, () is the general feminine form of 'to you' but also the pausal masculine form.cf. In Spanish, voiced fricative/approximants are pronounced as stops after a pausa and after a nasal. In Tuscan, the full infinitive form of the verb occurs only pre-pausa. In Kombe, a word-final high tone becomes low or downstepped in pausa. In Mehri, emphatic consonants become ejectives pre- pausa.

They originate in freshwater habitats in South America where ranging from Venezuela to the Paraguay‚ÄìParan√° River, including the Amazon Basin. They are popular in aquaria. The fish is all black except for two white rings on its tail, and a white blaze on its nose, which can occasionally extend into a stripe down its back. It moves mainly by undulating a long fin on its underside. It will grow to a maximum length of . Black ghost knife fish are nocturnal. They are a weakly electric fish which use an electric organ and receptors distributed over the length of their body in order to locate insect larvae.Nelson M. E. & MacIver M. A. (1999). \\"Prey capture in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus albifrons: sensory acquisition strategies and electrosensory consequences\\". J. Exp. Biol. 202: 1195‚Äì1203, pdf Black ghost knifefish with its underside pointing towards the camera The black ghost knifefish natively lives in fast moving, sandy bottom creeks in a tropical climate. South American natives believe that the ghosts of the departed take up residence in these fish,Axelrod H. R. (1996). Exotic Tropical Fishes. T.F.H. Publications. hence the name. The black ghost knifefish is a weakly electric fish as a result of the electromotor and electrosensory systems it possesses. While some fish can only receive electric signals, the black ghost knifefish can both produce and sense the electrical impulses. Electrogenesis occurs when a specialized electric organ found in the tail of the fish generates electrical signals, which are thus called electric organ discharges (EODs). Then, for these EODs to be sensed by the fish, electroreception occurs when groups of sensory cells embedded in the skin, known as electroreceptor organs, detect the electrical change. The EODs are used for two major purposes: electrolocation and communication. The kind of EOD produced can be used to distinguish between two types of weakly electric fish: the pulse-type and the wave-type. The black ghost knifefish are considered to be the latter type, because they can continuously generate EODs in small intervals. Wave-type EODs have a narrow power spectra, and can be heard as a tonal sound, where the discharge rate establishes the fundamental frequency. By emitting its own continuous sinusoidal train of EODs, the fish can determine the presence of nearby objects by sensing perturbations in timing and amplitude of electric fields, an ability known as active electrolocation. The particular organs used to sense the self-generated high- frequency EODs are tuberous electroreceptor organs. On the other hand, when low-frequency electric fields are generated by external sources instead of the fish itself, a different class of electroreceptor organs is used for this passive electrolocation, called ampullary organs. Therefore, the black ghost knifefish uses an active and a passive electrosystem, each with its own corresponding receptor organs. The fish can also use a mechanosensory lateral line system, which detects water disturbances created by the motion of the fish's body. As nocturnal hunters, the fish can rely on all three systems to navigate through dark environments and detect their prey. Each species has a characteristic EOD baseline frequency range, which varies with sex and age within the species, as well. The baseline frequency is maintained to be almost constant at stable temperature, but will usually be changed due to the presence of others of the same species. Such changes in frequency relevant to social interaction are called frequency modulations (FMs). The role these FMs have in communication is significant, as black ghost knifefish have developed jamming avoidance responses, which are behavioral responses that avoid the overlapping of EOD frequencies between conspecific individuals to prevent sensory confusion. Moreover, a study was conducted that focused on sexual dimorphism in electrocommunication signals. Female black ghost knifefish generate EODs at a higher frequency than the males, an FM which can be used for gender recognition. A study found the subordinate black ghost knifefish exhibited noticeable gradual frequency rises (GFRs) in their EODs whereas the dominant fish did not, supporting the researchers' hypothesis that GFRs during communication are indicative of submissive signals. It is possible to use a device to convert a captive fish's electrical signals into audible sound, allowing listeners to hear the fish \\"talk\\". The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis has a display with such a device and a black ghost knifefish. References  Further reading  * MacIver M. A., Patankar N. A. & Shirgaonkar A. A.

It was published in the UK by Newsfield Publications Ltd and later by Europress Impact. The magazine launched in April, with the cover date May 1985, as the sister magazine to CRASH. It focused on the C64 for much of its shelf life, but later incorporated Amiga game news and reviews. Like CRASH for the ZX Spectrum, it had a dedicated cult following amongst C64 owners and was well known for its irreverent sense of humour as well as its extensive, detailed coverage of the C64 scene. The magazine adopted an innovative review system that involved the use of the reviewers' faces, artistically rendered by in- house artists Oli Frey and Mark Kendrick, to express their reaction to the games. These eventually evolved into static cartoons as the magazine began catering for a younger market. By 1992, the magazine had changed so dramatically in design and editorial direction that then-publisher Europress decided to relaunch the magazine. Thus, issue 91 of Zzap!64 became issue 1 of Commodore Force, a magazine that itself lasted until March 1994. History The first issue of Zzap!64, dated May 1985, was released on 11 April 1985. Its inaugural editorial team included editor Chris Anderson, Software Editor Bob Wade, freelance writer Steve Cooke (who joined the staff from the recently folded Personal Computer Games), and reviewers Gary Penn and Julian Rignall, who won their jobs after having placed as finalists at a video game competition. The editorial headquarters was in Yeovil, more than 120 miles from Newsfield's headquarters in Ludlow; the team was relocated to Ludlow after three months to cut costs, and Anderson and Wade left the staff after declining to make the move. Anderson would later found Future Publishing and the TED Conference. As the Amiga gained popularity in the UK, Zzap!64 began to publish occasional reviews of Amiga games. The Amiga coverage became a fixed feature of the magazine in issue 43 (November 1988), when the title was renamed to Zzap!64 Amiga. The magazine experienced controversy in 1989, when three out of four reviewers (Gordon Houghton, Kati Hamza and Maff Evans) were fired and replaced during production of issue 50 (June 1989). The only one remaining, Paul Rand, had been employed at Zzap!64 a mere two months. Issue 50's editorial mentioned nothing of what happened, and the issue featured content from the three fired reviewers without discussing their fates. Issue 74 (June 1991) saw the dropping of all Amiga coverage (the word \\"Amiga\\" was dropped from the name in 1990), and the magazine became completely devoted to the C64 once more. Four months later the publisher Newsfield declared bankruptcy and publication was suspended for a month. Europress Impact (a satellite company of Europress launched by Roger Kean, Oliver Frey and Jonathan Rignall) became the new publisher of Zzap!64, beginning with issue 79 (December 1991). Issue 90 (November 1992) was the last official Zzap!64 issue. From the following month, the magazine was replaced by Commodore Force. =In Italy= The Italian edition (just titled ZZap!), authorised by the original publisher, was not limited to Commodore 64 games, but it also reviewed games for other 8-bit machines like the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC and the Atari 8-bit family. Around 80% of the content was translated with the remainder written in Italy. From issue 1 (May 1986) to issue 73 (December 1992) it was released as an actual magazine; with issue 74 (January 1993) it became an inset of the Italian version of The Games Machine until December 1993 when it stopped being published. From 1996 to 1999, Zzap! became an online magazine, a PC gaming website with a different \\"cover\\" each month and a mailbag, which reviewed games with the same style of the original magazine. In 2002, a special \\"issue 85\\", dedicated to then recently released games for 8-bit machines, was released in PDF format. Commemorative issues In March 2002, a special \\"Issue 107\\" of Zzap!64 was published digitally in PDF format, later receiving a limited print run of 200 copies. Originally intended as a fan project based on a suggestion by journalist Cameron Davis in a Zzap!64 discussion forum, a number of ex-Newsfield writers later volunteered to join the project, including former editors Gordon Houghton, Robin Hogg and Paul Glancey.http://theburrow.zzap64.co.uk/zzap/zzap107/zzap107.html The special issue reflected the C64's continuing popularity in the 21st Century as a platform for retro gamers and hobbyists, with the majority of reviews focusing on recently released C64 games. The magazine's design was based on \\"classic era\\" Zzap!64, and the front cover was based on an illustration by former Newsfield artist Oli Frey, significantly revised by designer Craig Grannell. Another special issue of Zzap!64 was created in July 2005 to celebrate the magazine's twentieth anniversary.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240605retrogayer Dubbed The Def Tribute to Zzap!64, it was professionally printed and given away with issue 18 of Retro Gamer magazine. Although more celebratory and retrospective in design than issue 107, it nevertheless featured a great deal of new content, including a foreword and articles by former Newsfield director and Zzap!64 editor Roger Kean and new material from former editors Gary Penn and Chris Anderson. The front cover and centerfold featured rare illustrations by Oli Frey from his pre-Newsfield days.

His paternal grandparents were David Wallace, an ironmaster, and Janet (n√©e Weir) Wallace. His aunt, Edith Wallace, was the wife of Maj. Robert Dunbar Sinclair-Wemyss. He was educated at Harrow before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Career In 1911, Wallace joined the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards Reserve, gaining the rank of Captain, serving as adjutant from 1915 to 1918. He was decorated with the award of the Military Cross (MC) after being wounded four times during the Great War. After the War, he became assistant Military Attach√© at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. He acted as a special Commissioner for the North- East coast and acted as aide-de-camp to the Governor General of Canada in 1920. =Political career= He was first elected to the House of Commons at Member of Parliament (MP) for Rugby from 1922 to 1923, then represented Hornsey from 1924 until his death in 1941 (when he was considered one of the richest members of the House of Commons). He served as Assistant Government Whip from 1928 to 1929; Junior Lord of the Treasury in 1929 and 1931; Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1931 to 1934; Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1935 to 1935; Secretary for Overseas Trade from 1935 to 1937; Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1937 to 1938; Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1938 to 1939. On 21 April 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Wallace the Minister of Transport. Wallace was invested as a Privy Counsellor by King Edward VIII in June 1936, along with Lt.-Col. David John Colville (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland) and, his former brother-in-law, Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr (Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education). Personal life Wallace was twice married and the father of five sons, four of whom died while serving in the military. On 26 November 1913 Wallace married Lady (Myra) Idina Sackville, daughter of Gilbert George Reginald Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr and Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey.The Genealogy of the Wallace Family Lady Idina designed Kildonan House in Barrhill, South Ayrshire with the architect James Miller in homage to her childhood home, but they separated before it was completed. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1919, they were the parents of two sons: * David John Wallace MC (1914‚Äì1944), a Major in the King's Royal Rifle Corps who was killed in action during World War II while serving with the Special Operations Executive in Greece (during the Battle of Menina) and who married Joan Prudence Magor, a daughter of Richard Magor of Chelmsford, in 1939. * Gerard Euan Wallace (1915‚Äì1943), a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve who was also killed in a flying accident in Canada during World War II and who married Elizabeth Lawson in 1940.

Princess Margaret, by then married to the Antony Armstrong-Jones, attended the wedding. He inherited a coal and iron fortune estimated at more than ¬£2,000,000. After undergoing a serious operation before Christmas 1940, Wallace died on 9 February 1941. His widow, who married Herbert Agar (the American journalist who was editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal) in 1945, lived another forty years before her death in 1981. =Descendants= Through his eldest son David, he was a grandfather of two: Laura Jacqueline Wallace (b. 1941), who married Dominic Paul Morland (a son of Sir Oscar Charles Morland GBE KCMG, of Pickering, Yorkshire and Alice Lindley) in 1963, they divorced and she married, secondly, Keith Fitchett, in 2003; and Cary Davina Wallace (b. 1942), who married David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford.

Serving as the administrative capital of the New Forest, it is a popular tourist attraction, with many independent shops, art galleries, caf√©s, museums, pubs and hotels. The nearest city is Southampton, about nine miles () to the north-east. As of 2001 Lyndhurst had a population of 2,973,Census Profiles, NFDC increasing to 3,029 at the 2011 Census. The name derives from an Old English name, comprising the words lind (lime tree) and hyrst (wooded hill). Known as the \\"Capital of the New Forest\\", Lyndhurst houses the New Forest District Council. The first mention of Lyndhurst was in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name 'Linhest'. The Court of Verderers sits in the Queens House in Lyndhurst. The church of St. Michael and All Angels was built in the 1860s, and contains a fresco by Lord Leighton and stained-glass windows by Charles Kempe, William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and others; Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Alice in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, is buried there. Glasshayes House (the former Lyndhurst Park Hotel) is the only surviving example of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's architectural experimentation, and local folklore records Lyndhurst as the site of a Dragon-slaying, and as being haunted by the ghost of Richard Fitzgeorge de Stacpoole, 1st Duc de Stacpoole. History The Leighton Fresco, St Michael and All Angels church The name \\"Lyndhurst\\" is an Old English name, meaning 'Wooded hill with lime-trees growing'. The name comprises the words lind ('lime-tree') and hyrst ('wooded hill'). The first mention of Lyndhurst was in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name 'Linhest'. It was part of the royal lands of the New Forest, with the exception of 1 virgate which was held by Herbert the Forester. Herbert may have been the ancestor of the Lyndhurst family, beginning with Herbert Lyndhurst, who held the bailiwick and manor of Lyndhurst in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manor passed to Henry III in 1270, and together with the wardenship of the New Forest, which invariably accompanied the manor, it formed part of the dowry of four consecutive queens: Eleanor of Castile, Margaret of France, Isabella of France, and Philippa of Hainault. The manor was back in the hands of the king before 1362, and it was granted to various noble families over the course of the following century. Between 1467 and 1581 it was in the hands of the Earls of Arundel, after which it once again reverted to the Crown. The estate was once again passed to various noble families until 1667, when Charles II granted it to Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton. He was followed successively by his son and grandson, but by the mid 18th century it was back in royal hands, being held successively by Prince William Henry (up to 1805) and Prince Frederick (until 1827). Subsequently, the manor was deemed \\"not important to be kept\\", and the copyholds of the manor, which included estates in Minstead, Burley, Bartley and Poulner, either became enfranchised or passed to the Crown. A royal park was attached to the manor of Lyndhurst from a very early date. It was unusual for being a King's Park within a King's Forest. In 1299 it covered an area of , the profits from the honey gathered there amounting to 2 shillings per annum. It was actively worked during the 14th and 15th centuries when payments were made for the fencing and repairing of the palings. The \\"old Park\\" of Lyndhurst is where the Lime Wood (formerly Parkhill) Hotel now stands, the new park being on the A337 Brockenhurst road. Geography Lyndhurst High Street Lyndhurst is in the New Forest National Park, in Hampshire, England. The village is the administrative capital of the New Forest, with the district council based in the village. The Court of Verderers sits in the Queen's House in Lyndhurst. The local headquarters of the Forestry Commission, the body that handles the maintenance of the softwood plantations, forest roads and paths, and controlling the spread of invasive plants, such as rhododendrons and gorse is also based in the Queen's House. The church of St. Michael and All Angels is a major landmark, built of many different colours of brick, on one of the highest points in the village. Glasshayes House (also known as the Lyndhurst Park Hotel) is a Georgian \\"Gothick\\" villa, and after its 1912 alterations is the only surviving example of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's forays into architecture.Glasshayes House: the 1912 extension of The Lyndhurst Grand Hotel, The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia, 2017 In local tradition it is haunted by the ghost of Richard Fitzgeorge de Stacpoole, 1st Duc de Stacpoole. It sits adjacent to Bolton's Bench, a picturesque hill to the east of the village which, according to local folklore, was originally the corpse of a dragon;Bolton's Bench, New Forest Explorers GuideReeve, Richard. New Forest Hauntings, Historic-UK, 2016 Other local landmarks include a row of much photographed thatched cottages on the road to the neighbouring hamlet of Emery Down, and the New Forest Centre, which includes the New Forest Museum and New Forest Gallery. Also situated towards the outskirts of the village is Foxlease, one of the training and activity centres of Girlguiding UK, which has been the scene of several internationally important Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting events. It was established in February 1922 following the marriage of president Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. The headquarters of the privately owned British chemicals company Ineos is located in the village. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Bank and Emery Down. Lyndhurst is surrounded by varied \\"forest\\", from the heathland of Parkhill to the bog of Matley, and the open forest with its ancient oak and beech to the enclosures of softwoods. The Queen's House The Queen's House The most important building in Lyndhurst is the Queen's House, which has also in the past been called the King's House, for the name changes according to the gender of the monarch.Lyndhurst ‚Äì Queen‚Äôs House, New Forest Explorers Guide It is the principal building owned by the Crown in the New Forest, and contains the Verderers' Hall, home of the ancient Verderers' Court. The Queen's House is also the local headquarters of the Forestry Commission. A manor house probably existed in Lyndhurst by the 13th century. In the reign of Edward I an order was given for \\"twenty oaks to make laths for the use of the queen's manor- house at Lyndhurst.\\" This house was probably superseded by the hunting lodge built at Lyndhurst in the 14th century, which received frequent royal visits, and for which there are many records relating to the repair and enlargement. In 1388 a hall was built within the lodge, known later as the Verderers' Hall. Rebuilding took place in the reign of Henry VIII, and especially in the 17th century, during the reigns of Charles I and Charles II, and the current structure largely dates from this time. The last monarch to stay here was George III who visited the New Forest in June 1789.Gerald Lascelles, (1915), Thirty-five years in the New Forest, page 131. E. Arnold Frances Burney, who was Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte, described the house as \\"a straggling, inconvenient, old house, but delightfully situated, in a village‚Äîlooking indeed at present like a populous town, from the amazing concourse of people that have crowded into it.\\" The building today is a rambling two-storey structure in brick. The prisoners' dock, tables and chairs of considerable age are preserved in the hall. Also to be found within is the so-called \\"Stirrup of Rufus\\", which was used to measure dogs. Religious sites St Michael and all Angels Church The village's Anglican church, St Michael and All Angels, is on a mound overlooking the village. It was built between 1858‚Äì70, and is the third such building on the site. The church was designed by William White. It is constructed with red brick with yellow trim. It has a tall (160 ft,(48.8m)) brick-banded spire at the north-west end which can be seen from The Isle of Wight.Margaret Green, Hampshire Churches, Winton Publications,1967,1969,1976. Page 23 The interior has yellow, white and red exposed brickwork, and a nave roof decorated with life-size supporting angels. The church contains a fresco by Frederick Leighton showing the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, with biblical characters said to be modelled on local people. The church also contains stained glass windows designed by William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and Charles Kempe. Alice Liddell, also known as Alice Hargreaves, the inspiration for Alice in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, lived in and around Lyndhurst after her marriage to Reginald Hargreaves, and is buried in the graveyard. There is also a very fine, small Catholic Church of the Assumption and St Edward the Confessor, built by Sir Arthur Blomfield between 1894 and 1896 as a memorial to Marie-Louise Souberbielle. Education and culture Saint Michael and All Angels Infant School is the main village school. New Forest Small School is an independent school for children aged 3 to 16. In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Lyndhurst library. The Bisterne Dragon Lyndhurst is notable in English folklore for being the supposed location of a dragon-slaying. The local tradition is that a dragon had his den at Burley Beacon in Burley.John Henry Blunt, (1877), Dursley and its neighbourhood; being historical memorials of Dursley, pages 124‚Äì6 There are several versions of the tale, one being that the creature \\"flew\\" every morning to Bisterne, where it would be supplied with milk. To kill the dragon, a valiant knight (usually named Berkeley) built a hide, and with two dogs lay in wait. The creature came as usual one morning for its milk, and when the hut door was opened the dogs attacked it, and while thus engaged the knight took the dragon by surprise, the dogs dying in the affray. The fight raged throughout the forest, with the dragon finally dying outside Lyndhurst, its corpse turning into a great hill (now known as Boltons Bench). Though the knight had defeated the dragon he had been mentally broken by the battle, and after thirty days and thirty nights he went back to Boltons Bench to die alone atop it, his body turning into the yew tree which can still be seen today. Transport links The village is the meeting point of the A35, which runs NE to SW between Southampton and Bournemouth, and the A337 which runs north to south between Cadnam on the M27, and Lymington, a ferry port for the Isle of Wight on the south coast. To deal with the large volume of traffic through the village, there is a one-way system. This in effect turns the major roads of the village into a traffic circle. In summer the traffic through the village increases hugely because of the tourists. This can create queues into the village from all directions. It has long been mooted that the solution to Lyndhurst's traffic problem is to build a bypass through the surrounding National Park forest land. In 1947 the Government's Baker Report accepted that a bypass might be necessary, and provision was made in the New Forest Act 1949 to construct roads through the forest with the consent of the Verderers.Country Life, (1987), Volume 181, page 81 Public inquiries were held in 1975 and 1983. On both occasions the various routes proposed by the county council were opposed by the Verderers as being detrimental to the environment. The Verderers stated that they would not oppose a less harmful route. The last serious attempt at a Lyndhurst Bypass Bill was rejected in July 1988.Tam Dalyell, Thistle Diary, in New Scientist, 22 September 1988, page 69 In 2006 Lyndhurst Parish Council again called for a bypass,Bypass Homepage, Lyndhurst Parish Council, 22 October 2012, at the Internet Archive and proposed that the road followed the route suggested in 1983 but with a cut-and-cover tunnel.The Parish Council Bypass Route Recommendation, Lyndhurst Parish Council, 22 October 2012, at the Internet Archive Although Lyndhurst itself does not have a railway station, it has for many years been served by the former Lyndhurst Road station, three miles () away, which has been renamed Ashurst New Forest. It is also only four miles () from Brockenhurst and under 4 miles from Beaulieu Road station ‚Äì all these stations are on the South Western Main Line to London and Weymouth, serving Bournemouth and Southampton. Bus services operated by Bluestar run frequently to Southampton and Lymington. There are also two daily National Express coach departures to London Victoria. The New Forest Tour, an open-top bus tour run in the summer, starts and finishes in Lyndhurst.

It was the largest massacre of civilians committed by the Waffen SS in Western Europe during the war. It is also the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Italy. Massacre In reprisal for attacks on German soldiers by partisans and the Resistance between 29 September and 5 October 1944, SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Walter Reder led soldiers of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf√ºhrer-SS to systematically kill hundreds of people in Marzabotto. They also killed numerous residents of the adjacent Grizzana Morandi and Monzuno, the area of the massif of Monte Sole (part of the Apennine range in the province of Bologna). Unknown victims Historians have struggled to document the number of victims. Some sources report up to 1,830 victims; others estimate 955 people killed. The Peace School Foundation of Monte Sole reports 770 victims. This number is close to the official report by Sturmbannf√ºhrer Reder, who reported the \\"execution of 728 bandits\\". Among the victims, 155 were less than 10 years old, 95 were aged 10 to 16, 142 were over 60 years old, 454 were male and 316 were female. Five were priests. Giovanni Fornasini, a parish priest and member of the Resistance, risked his life to protect the population from the Nazis during the massacres. While Fornasini saved the lives of many of his parishioners and managed to escape immediate death, he was later discovered by an SS officer while he was burying the bodies of those killed in the massacre, which was forbidden by the Nazis. The officer accused him of crimes committed in the Marzabotto area. When Fornasini confessed to having helped the villagers avoid execution, the officer shot and killed him. Justice * The British tried SS General Max Simon for his part in the massacre. He was sentenced to death, later changed to life in prison. Simon was pardoned in 1954 and died in 1961. * The Americans arrested SS Major Walter Reder, an Austrian national, in Salzburg, and passed him to the British. Reder was extradited to Italy in May 1948 to stand trial for war crimes. In 1951 he was tried in an Italian military court in Bologna. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the military prison at Gaeta. He was released in 1985 and died six years later in 1991. * In 1998, on the 54th anniversary of the massacre, the German President Johannes Rau made a formal apology to Italy and expressed his \\"profound sorrow and shame\\" to the families of the victims of Marzabotto. * In January 2007, 10 of 17 suspected former SS members were found guilty in absentia by an Italian military tribunal in the north Italian town of La Spezia. They were sentenced to life imprisonment for the massacre. The Italian media reported that the 10 were also ordered to pay roughly ‚Ç¨100 million to the survivors and relatives of the victims. Seven suspects were acquitted.

In visual arts, a model sheet, also known as a character board, character sheet, character study or simply a study, is a document used to help standardize the appearance, poses, and gestures of a character in arts such as animation, comics, and video games. Model sheets are required when multiple artists are involved in the production of an animated film, game, or comic to help maintain continuity in characters from scene to scene. In animation, one animator may only do one shot out of the several hundred that are required to complete an animated feature film. A character not drawn according to the production's standardized model is referred to as off-model. Model sheets are also used for references in 3D modeling to guide proper proportions of models. Purposes Model sheets have also been used in the past to maintain graphic continuity over the years for long lasting cartoon productions of short or short features such as the Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies series. Model sheets are drawings of posed cartoon or comic strip characters that are created to provide a reference template for several artists who collaborate in the production of a lengthy or multiple-edition work of art such as a comic book, animated film or television series. Model sheets usually depict the character's head and body as they appear at various angles (a process known as \\"model rotation\\"), includes sketches of the character's hands and feet, and shows several basic facial expressions. Model sheets ensure that, despite the efforts of several or many artists, their work exhibits unity, as if one artist created the drawings (that is, they are \\"on model\\"). They show the character's structure, proportions, attire, and body language. Often, several sheets are required to depict a character's subtler emotional and physical attitudes. Depending on the whim of animation direction, deviations from the model may be permitted in the course of final animation; this \\"tightness\\" of model is a major distinguishing factor in overall animation style, as it constitutes a tradeoff between expressiveness and smoothness/consistency. As such, the usage of models varies widely between studios and projects. Model sheets can also be used in the construction of costumes or sculpted figurines. Specific annotations Model sheets also provide notes that present specific information about how to develop particular features of the character, such as his or her head shape, hair length and style, size and position of the eyes and the mouth. Examples Some model sheets are specific to particular completed or ongoing projects, whereas others are more general and inclusive of a studio's entire collection of characters. Animation studios besides Disney and fans also post model sheets on their Internet Web sites. Larry's Toon Institute provides a generic model sheet for the purpose of introducing the concept of model sheets. Copyright and fair use Model sheets are not typically in the public domain, but are copyrighted material owned by the animation studio which created it. Although model sheets originally are intended for artists who work for the studios that own the characters for which these templates are developed, other artists, such as those who create fan art, profit from them by adapting their characters to their own uses.

The Moorish Revival building is decorated with crop art; the murals and designs covering the building are made from corn and other grains, and a new design is constructed each year. The Corn Palace is a popular tourist destination, visited by up to 500,000 people each year. The Corn Palace serves the community as a venue for concerts, sports events, exhibits and other community events. Each year, the Corn Palace is celebrated with a citywide festival, the Corn Palace Festival. Historically it was held at harvest time in September, but recently it has been held at the end of August. Other popular annual events include the Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo in July and the Corn Palace Polka Festival in September. It is also home to the Dakota Wesleyan University Tigers and the Mitchell High School Kernels basketball teams. History In the late 19th Century, a number of cities on the Great Plains constructed \\"crop palaces\\" (also known as \\"grain palaces\\") to promote themselves and their products. As the idea succeeded, it spread, including: a Corn Palace in Sioux City, Iowa, that was active from 1887‚Äì1891; a Corn Palace in Gregory, South Dakota; a Grain Palace in Plankinton, South Dakota; and a Bluegrass Palace in Creston, Iowa.Corn Palace, Mitchell, South Dakota, RoadsideAmerica.com; accessed 2016-06-28. From 1887 to 1930, at least thirty-four corn palaces were built across the Midwest United States; only the Mitchell Corn Palace has remained intact. The original Mitchell Corn Palace (known as \\"The Corn Belt Exposition\\") was built in 1892 to showcase the rich soil of South Dakota and encourage people to settle in the area. It was a wooden castle structure on Mitchell's Main Street, constructed on land donated by Louis Beckwith, a member of the First Corn Palace Committee. In 1904‚Äì1905, the city of Mitchell mounted a challenge to the city of Pierre in an unsuccessful attempt to replace it as the state capital of South Dakota. As part of this effort, the Corn Palace was rebuilt in 1905. In 1921, the Corn Palace was rebuilt once again, with a design by the architectural firm Rapp and Rapp of Chicago. Russian-style onion domes and Moorish minarets were added in 1937, giving the Palace the distinctive appearance that it has today. In 2004, national media attention was drawn to the Corn Palace, when it received Homeland Security funding. This drew criticism of the Department of Homeland Security and its grant program. In 2007, the Corn Palace subsequently received $25,000 in DHS funding for a camera system useful for purposes including Barack Obama's visit in 2008, and as reported by the Mitchell Daily Republic, to protect a \\"new Fiberglass statue of the Corn Palace mascot Cornelius\\" in 2009. This statue sits across Main Street, west of the Corn Palace. The Palace's domes were renovated in 2015 after shaking in strong winds. The new turrets are made of architectural metals. Concerts at the Corn Palace include: Johnny Cash thrice (once in 1968), The Beach Boys in 1969, Willie Nelson twice (once in 2003), Brad Paisley in 2004, Styx twice (once in 2005), Chubby Checker in 2005, Weird Al Yankovic in 2007, David Cook in 2009, Charlie Daniels Band in 2012, Billy Currington with Jake Owen in 2012, The Turtles with Mark Lindsay in 2013, Warrant with FireHouse in 2014, Pat Benatar in 2014, and Theory of a Deadman in 2015. Mural construction The exterior corn murals are replaced and redesigned each year with a new theme, with designs created by local artists. From 1948 to 1971, the artist Oscar Howe designed the panels. Calvin Schultz designed the murals from 1977 to 2002. From 2003 to 2017, the murals have been designed by Cherie Ramsdell. No new mural was created in 2006 due to an extreme drought. Beginning in 2018, designs have been created by Dakota Wesleyan University students. As of 2018, it costs an estimated $175,000 each time the Palace is redecorated. Twelve naturally-occurring shades of corn are grown by local farmers to create the artwork. Artists' drawings are transferred to black tar paper labeled with codes corresponding to colors, providing a \\"corn-by-numbers\\" pattern showing where each colored cob should be nailed. Corn cobs are split in two lengthwise and nailed to the exterior of the building, using approximately 1.5 million nails and 325,000 ears of corn.

Alfisols form in semi-arid to humid areas, typically under a hardwood forest cover. They have a clay- enriched subsoil and relatively high native fertility. \\"Alf\\" refers to aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe). Because of their productivity and abundance, the Alfisols represent one of the more important soil orders for food and fiber production. They are widely used both in agriculture and forestry, and are generally easier to keep fertile than other humid-climate soils, though those in Australia and Africa are still very deficient in nitrogen and available phosphorus. Those in monsoonal tropical regions, however, have a tendency to acidify when heavily cultivated, especially when nitrogenous fertilizers are used. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), most Alfisols are classified as Luvisols or Lixisols, but some are classed as Retisols or Nitisols. Aqualfs are mainly Stagnosols or Planosols. Alfisols with a natric horizon are mainly Solonetz. Alfisols occupy around one-tenth of the Earth's ice-free land surface. They are dominant in many areas, such as the Ohio River basin in the United States, southern and unglaciated Western Europe, the Baltic region and central European Russia, the drier parts of Peninsular India, Sudan in Africa, and many parts of South America. Alfisols have undergone only moderate leaching. By definition, they have at least 35% base saturation, meaning calcium, magnesium, and potassium are relatively abundant. This is in contrast to Ultisols, which are the more highly leached forest soils having less than 35% base saturation. In eastern North America, Alfisols are commonly found in glaciated areas while Ultisols are restricted to the areas south of the limit of maximum glaciation. The fossil record of Alfisols begins in the Late Devonian. Probably owing to their fertility, they are the oldest forest soils; vegetation on weathered Oxisols, by contrast, is not known earlier than Middle Permian. Fossil Alfisols remain common from the Carboniferous and all periods since the Eocene. Suborders * Aqualfs ‚Äì This suborder is saturated with water long enough to cause oxygen depletion.

Puerto del Carmen (Pto. del Carmen) is the main tourist town on the island of Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain. It is part of the municipality of T√≠as. Most of Lanzarote's over 1 million visitors per year choose this town as their destination. As a result, almost all of the town's economy revolves around tourism.  History  The area of Puerto del Carmen was inhabited before the arrival of the Normans on the island and, at least since the 16th century, known as Ti√±osa, so it appears on the maps of Torriani (as Tinosa), Brihuela/Cosala (as La Ti√±osa), P.A. del Castillo (as La Ti√±o√ßa) and Riviere (as La Tinosa). This toponym is probably of Guanche origin, adapted to the phonetics of Spanish and related to other lexical variants such as Ti√±or in El Hierro or Ti√±oa in Tenerife. After The Conquest it becomes a place of anchorage. In 1591 Leonardo Torriani, refers to the natural port of La Ti√±osa. Later on, it became important with the barrel trade. In 1900 it was declared a Port of General Interest, a distinction it lost in 1928 in favour of Arrecife. In 1904, La Ti√±osa became a town with 194 inhabitants, mainly dedicated to fishing.2 In 1957, the small fishing village was renamed Puerto del Carmen, in honour of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen. The promenade known as \\"Avenida de las Playas\\" contains many restaurants, shops, bars and casinos. From the coast it has been extending inland, up to a distance of approximately one kilometre. Tourism Beach of Puerto del Carmen (June 2015) Since the opening of the Hotel los Fariones in 1967 it attracts tourists from all over Europe, particularly Ireland, the UK and Germany as well as from Scandinavia and Spain. The Avenida de las Playas, the main street/avenue in the town, extends some 7 km along the island's southern coast, with beaches on one side and many restaurants, bars, shops and other tourist attractions on the other. Apartments, villas and hotels cover a kilometre or so inland from the coastline. The quaint and peaceful old town includes the harbour and docks, the Puerto Tinosa. Here there are a smaller variety of restaurants and bars with views across the harbour and the sea to the volcanic mountains of Papagayo beyond to views of the next island of Fuerteventura. Vista del Puerto de La Ti√±osa. Scuba diving Puerto del Carmen is host to a large number of dive centres and scuba diving is one of the most popular sports there with very favourable conditions. Water temperatures vary from 19¬∞C in the winter to 23¬∞C in the summer and visibility averages over 25 metres to 30 metres. Shopping and dining The old restaurant ¬´La casa roja¬ª in the old harbour Puerto Del Carmen hosts a variety of shops which sell mainly tourist-oriented products. The new town hosts bars, restaurants and tourist shops. The old town has many restaurants with outdoor terraces that overlook the marina below and the distant volcanic peaks. The Biosfera Plaza is a newly constructed shopping plaza, opened in 2002, which includes many international brands and has entertainment facilities. There are a handful of clubs in the open until 6am which are often popular with many younger tourists.

Butterflying is a way of preparing meat, fish, or poultry for cooking by cutting it almost in two, but leaving the two parts connected; it is then often boned and flattened. Spatchcocking is a specific method for butterflying poultry that involves removing the backbone, and spatchcock as a noun may refer to a bird prepared in that way. Etymology \\"Butterfly\\" comes from the resemblance of the cut to the wings of a butterfly. Red meat In butchery, butterflying transforms a thick, compact piece of meat into a thinner, larger one. The meat is laid out on a cutting board and cut in half parallel to the board almost all the way to the other side, leaving a small \\"hinge\\", which is used to fold the meat out like a book. This technique is often used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, pounding out the meat with a meat mallet to make it thinner. For leg of lamb, it is generally followed by boning. Common uses of this technique include creating thin cutlets from chicken breasts for dishes such as chicken piccata, or rendering lamb leg roasts suitable for making roulades. It can also be a first step to dicing chicken or slicing it into strips. Because the butterflying technique results in a thinner piece of meat or poultry, it allows for quicker cooking times and often more even cooking. Poultry and \\"spatchcocking\\" A spatchcocked chicken Poultry is often butterflied. Butterflying makes poultry easier to grillMarcus Wareing, Shaun Hill, Charlie Trotter, Lyn Hall, Knife Skills in the Kitchen, 2008 , p. 169 or pan-broil.Gourmet Magazine, The Best of Gourmet, 2007 , p. 239 The more specific term spatchcocking refers to a variation on butterflying that also removes the backbone and possibly the sternum, typically from a smaller bird. Removing the sternum allows the bird to be flattened more fully. This is popular for grilling or roasting. According to The Oxford Companion to Food by Alan Davidson, the word spatchcock could be found in cookbooks as far back as the 18th and 19th centuries. It was thought to be of Irish origin, possibly short for \\"dispatch cock,\\" which referred to \\"grilling a bird after splitting it open down the back and spreading the two halves out flat.\\" It may also derive from \\"spitchcock,\\" a method of grilling eels. Spatchcock may also be used as a noun to refer to a small bird that has been prepared by spatchcocking. Fish A butterfly fillet of fish is a double fillet, with the backbone and other bones removed by splitting the fish down the back or the belly.J.G. Ferguson et al., The Modern Family Cook Book, 1942, p. 499 Other Butterflying shrimp or lobster tail involves cutting the hard top side, without cutting all the way down to the other, softer side.

Their lyrics tend to be bohemian and often talk about life in the ‚Äúbarrio‚Äù or poor neighborhoods of Mexican cities, especially Monterrey. As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations and have toured Mexico and the United States. The music They are unique on the Mexican music scene with their music being called world beat, cumbia grupero and rap but, their musical style crosses various genres and can combine any number including hip-hop, reggae, norte√±o, cumbia, rock-and-roll, polka, huapango and vallenato. Much of what keeps it together are Latin folk rhythms and the use of accordion licks. The band has called their work‚Äúfreestyle norte√±o popular;‚Äù however, founder Tony Hernandez strongly links the music to rock as he says that rock showed that mixing genres is possible and they maintain rock‚Äôs rebellious nature. Their work, especially their early work, has received criticism, and some dismiss it as \\"naco\\" (low class), as they celebrate subcultures such as ch√∫ntaros, barrio youths wearing baggy pants and hip-hop musical tastes. As one of few major Mexican alternative bands with authentic barrio roots, Silencio works to get that culture more accepted by mainstream Mexican society. Life in the barrio is a very common theme in the music. Tony Hernandez often talks nostalgically about life in his hometown of Monterrey, grilling carne asada on the street and playing the Beatles or La Tropa Colombiana along with family and friends. However, their lyrics are more bohemian than materialistic. Although rap was a major element in their early work, unlike Spanish language rap artists, they perform live with real instruments. They also collaborate with other musicians on projects, to add instruments such as congas, or event to extend the band into ten pieces, with the configuration of an Afro-Caribbean orchestra with brass and percussion sections. The album Ch√∫ntaros Radio Poder creates the day in an imaginary radio station, with a number of popular Monterrey DJs of the time taking turns presenting the songs. History El Gran Silencio emerge from the poor barrios of the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, founded by brothers Tony and Cano Hernandez in 1993. At first they called themselves La Zona del Silencio, and had only a cheap harmonica and guitar, sing pails and trash cans for the percussion, while saving money for real instruments. After finding a cassette of band of the same name, they changed it to El Gran Silencio, taken from a song by Rodrigo ‚ÄúRockrigo‚Äù Gonz√°lez, a singer/songwriter who died in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Their very first recording was on a local, independent label, but their first commercial release was Libres y Locos in 1998. It immediately caused waves in the Spanish language rock community, as it combined rap-style lyrics with a ranchera attitude. The single from this album, Dormir So√±ando, had some airplay on MTV en Espa√±ol but did not become a hit on radio until it was covered by Los Chicos del Barrio. Their second album, Chuntaros Radio Poder,(2001) expanded the musical mix, and the rap element faded. This album began with wide mix of styles from those reminiscent of the rock of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, but with heavy Latin American rhythms from norte√±o to cumbia and vallenato. the album produced the alternative hit, Ch√∫ntaro Style. The band at first recorded in Mexico, but have since done so in the United States. However, their only appearance on US charts is a guest appearance with Juan Gabriel on the Kumbia Kings single No Tengo Dinero. As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations, including an album with other artists as a tribute to Los Tigres del Norte. Over it more than twenty year history, band members have changed, with the bass player changing twice. The first bass player was Julian Villareal and the next C√©sar Vulgar Hernandez. When Julian left, he sued the band. The current line up (2015) is Tony Hern√°ndez, Isaac Valdez, Ezequiel Alvarado and \\"Wiwa\\" Flores . Appearances Initially their ambition was to play a club in Monterrey, but since have toured both the United States and Mexico on multiple occasions, with appearances at music and cultural festivals such as the Festival J√≥venes que Muevan II in Guadalajara, Vive Latino 2015, Machaca Fest 2015 and twice at the, Festival Internacional Cervantino, Their second appearance here in 2014 was to represent their home state of Nuevo Le√≥n.

He is regarded as the \\"utak ng himagsikan\\" or \\"brain of the revolution\\". Two of his works, El Verdadero Decalogo (The True Decalogue, June 24, 1898), and Programa Constitucional dela Republica Filipina (The Constitutional Program of the Philippine Republic, 1898) became instrumental in the drafting of what would eventually be known as the Malolos Constitution. Mabini performed all his revolutionary and governmental activities despite having lost the use of both his legs to polio shortly before the Philippine Revolution of 1896. Mabini's role in Philippine history saw him confronting first Spanish colonial rule in the opening days of the Philippine Revolution, and then American colonial rule in the days of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The latter saw Mabini captured and exiled to Guam by American colonial authorities, allowed to return only two months before his eventual death in May 1903. Life =Early life and education= Apolinario Mabini was born on July 23, 1864 in Barangay Talaga in Tanauan, Batangas. He was the second of eight children of Dionisia Maranan y Magpantay, a vendor in the Tanauan market, and Inocencio Leon Mabini y Lira, an illiterate peasant. In 1881 Mabini received a scholarship to go to the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila. An anecdote about his stay there says that a professor there decided to pick on him because his shabby clothing clearly showed he was poor. Mabini amazed the professor by answering a series of very difficult questions with ease. His studies at Letran were periodically interrupted by a chronic lack of funds, and he earned money for his board and lodging by teaching children. = Law Studies = Mabini's mother had wanted him to enter the priesthood, but his desire to defend the poor made him decide to study law instead. A year after receiving his Bachiller en Artes with highest honors and the title Professor of Latin from Letran, he moved on to the University of Santo Tomas, where he received his law degree in 1894. Comparing Mabini's generation of Filipino intellectuals to the previous one of Jose Rizal and the other members of the propagandista movement, Journalist and National Artist of the Philippines for Literature Nick Joaquin describes Mabini's generation as the next iteration in the evolution of Filipino intellectual development: :Europe had been a necessary catalyst for the generation of Rizal. By the time of Mabini, the Filipino intellectual had advanced beyond the need for enlightenment abroad[....] The very point of Mabini‚Äôs accomplishment is that all his schooling, all his training, was done right here in his own country. The argument of Rizal‚Äôs generation was that Filipinos were not yet ready for self-government because they had too little education and could not aspire for more in their own country. The evidence of Mabini‚Äôs generation was that it could handle the affairs of government with only the education it had acquired locally. It no longer needed Europe; it had imbibed all it needed of Europe. Mabini joined the Guild of Lawyers after graduation, but he did not choose to practice law in a professional capacity. He did not set up his own law office, and instead continued to work in the office of a notary public. Instead, Mabini put his knowledge of law to much use during the days of the Philippine Revolution and the Filipino-American war. Joaquin notes that all his contributions to Philippine history somehow involved the law: :\\"His was a legal mind. He was interested in law as an idea, as an ideal[...] whenever he appears in our history he is arguing a question of legality.\\" = Masonry and La Liga Filipina = Mabini joined the fraternity of Freemasonry in September 1892, affiliating with lodge Balagtas, and taking on the name \\"Katabay\\". The following year, 1893, Mabini became a member of La Liga Filipina, which was being resuscitated after the arrest of its founder Jos√© Rizal in 1892. Mabini was made secretary of its new Supreme Council. This was Mabini's first time to join an explicitly patriotic organization. Mabini, whose advocacies favored the reformist movement, pushed for the organization to continue its goals of supporting La Solidaridad and the reforms it advocated. When more revolutionary members of the Liga indicated that they did not think the reform movement was getting results and wanted to more openly support revolution, La Liga Filipina split into two factions: the moderate Cuerpo de Compromisarios, which wanted simply to continue to support the revolution, and the explicitly revolutionary Katipunan. Mabini joined the Cuerpo de Compromisarios. When Jos√© Rizal, part of the \\"La Liga Filipina\\", was executed in December that year, however, he changed his mind and gave the revolution his wholehearted support. = Polio and eventual paralysis = Mabini was struck by polio in 1895, and the disease gradually incapacitated him until January 1896, when he finally lost the use of both his legs. = 1896 Revolution and Arrest = When the plans of the Katipunan were discovered by Spanish authorities, and the first active phase of the 1896 Philippine Revolution began in earnest, Mabini, still ill, was arrested along with numerous other members of La Liga Filipina. Thirteen patriots arrested in Cavite were tried and eventually executed, earning them the title of \\"Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite.\\" Jose Rizal himself was accused of being party to the revolution, and would eventually be executed in December that year. When the Spanish authorities saw that Mabini was paralyzed, however, they decided to release him. = Adviser to the Revolutionary Government = Sent to the hospital after his arrest, Mabini remained in ill health for a considerable time. He was seeking the curative properties of the hot springs in Los Ba√±os, Laguna in 1898 when Emilio Aguinaldo sent for him, asking him to serve as advisor to the revolution. During this convalescent period, Mabini wrote the pamphlets \\"El Verdadero Dec√°logo\\" and \\"Ordenanzas de la Revoluci√≥n.\\" Aguinaldo was impressed by these works and by Mabini's role as a leading figure in La Liga Filipina, and made arrangements for Mabini to be brought from Los Ba√±os to Kawit, Cavite. It took hundreds of men taking turns carrying his hammock to portage Mabini to Kawit. He continued to serve as the chief adviser for General Aguinaldo after the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12. He drafted decrees and edited the constitution for the First Philippine Republic, including the framework of the revolutionary government which was implemented in Malolos in 1899. =Prime Minister of the Philippines= Shortly after Aguinaldo's return to the Philippines from exile in Hong Kong in May 1898, he tasked Mabini with helping him establish a government. Mabini authored the June 18, 1898, decree which established the Dictatorial Government of the Philippines. After the Malolos Constitution, the basic law of the First Philippine Republic, was promulgated on January 21, 1899, Mabini was appointed Prime Minister and also Foreign Minister. He then led the first cabinet of the republic. Mabini found himself in the center of the most critical period in the new country's history, grappling with problems until then unimagined. Most notable of these were his negotiations with Americans, which began on March 6, 1899. The United States and the Philippine Republic were embroiled in extremely contentious and eventually violent confrontations. During the negotiations for peace, Americans proffered Mabini autonomy for Aguinaldo's new government, but the talks failed because Mabini's conditions included a ceasefire, which was rejected. Mabini negotiated once again, seeking for an armistice instead, but the talks failed yet again. Eventually, feeling that the Americans were not negotiating 'bona fide,' he forswore the Americans and supported war. He resigned from government on May 7, 1899. =Philippine American War, exile, and return= The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War saw Mabini taken more seriously as a threat by the Americans than he was under the Spanish: Says National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose: :\\"The Spaniards underestimated Mabini primarily because he was a cripple. Had they known of his intellectual perspicacity, they would have killed him earlier. The Americans did not. They were aware of his superior intelligence, his tenacity when he faced them in negotiations for autonomy and ceasefire.\\" On December 10, 1899, he was captured by Americans at Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, but granted leave to meet with W.H. Taft. In 1901, he was exiled to Guam, along with scores of revolutionists Americans referred to as insurrectos (rebels) and who refused to swear fealty to the United States. When Brig. Gen. Arthur MacArthur Jr. was asked to explain by the U.S. Senate why Mabini had to be deported, he cabled: Mabini returned to the Philippines after agreeing to take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States on February 26, 1903, before the Collector of Customs. On the day he sailed, he issued this statement to the press: To the chagrin of the American colonial officials, Mabini resumed his work of agitating for independence for the Philippines soon after his return from exile. = Death = Not long after his return, Mabini died of cholera in Manila on May 13, 1903, at the age of 38.  Historical Remembrance  Mabini's complex contributions to Philippine History are often distilled into two historical monikers - \\"Brains of the Revolution,\\" and \\"Sublime Paralytic.\\" Contemporary historians such as Ambeth Ocampo point out, though, that these two monikers are reductionist and simplistic, and \\"do not do justice to the hero‚Äôs life and legacy.\\" = \\"Brains of the Revolution\\" = Because of his role as advisor during the formation of the revolutionary government, and his contributions as statesman thereafter, Mabini is often referred to as the \\"Brains of the Revolution,\\" a historical moniker he sometimes shares with Emilio Jacinto, who served in a similar capacity for the earlier revolutionary movement, the Katipunan. = \\"Sublime Paralytic\\" = Mabini is also famous for having achieved all this despite having lost the use of his legs to polio just prior to the Philippine revolution. This has made Mabini one of the Philippines' most visually iconic national heroes, such that he is often referred to as \\"The Sublime Paralytic\\" (Tagalog: Dakilang Lumpo). Contemporary historians, however, point out that the title obscures Mabini's many achievements. Controversy about Mabini's paralysis Even during his lifetime, there were controversial rumors regarding the cause of Mabini's paralysis. Infighting among members of the Malolos congress led to the spread of rumors that Mabini's paralysis had been caused by venereal disease - specifically, syphilis. This was finally debunked in 1980, when Mabini's bones were exhumed and the autopsy proved conclusively that the cause of his paralysis was polio. This information reached National Artist F. Sionil Jos√© too late, however. By the time the historian Ambeth Ocampo told him about the autopsy results, he had already published Po-on, the first novel of his Rosales Saga. That novel contained plot points based on the premise that Mabini had indeed become a paralytic due to syphilis. In later editions of the book, the novelist corrected the error and issued an apology, which reads in part: In the later editions, Mabini's disease - an important plot point - was changed to an undefined liver ailment. The ailing Mabini takes pride in the fact that his symptoms are definitely not those of syphilis, despite the rumors spread by his detractors in the Philippine Revolutionary government. Tributes = Shrines = The Mabini Shrine, now located in the PUP campus in Santa Mesa, Manila * Two sites related to Mabini have been chosen to host shrines in his honor: ** The house where Mabini died is now located in the campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Santa Mesa, Manila, having been moved twice. The simple nipa retains the original furniture, and some of the books he wrote, and also contains souvenir items, while hosting the municipal library and reading facilities. ** Mabini was buried in his town of birth - what is now Talaga, Tanauan City, Batangas. An interactive museum containing historical artifacts, his personal properties, books he wrote, and it also provides historical information about him, the Philippines during his time, and some of his town's historical background was constructed, and was recently renovated and improved, on this site. It also sells books about him and souvenir items. A replica of the house Mabini was born in was also constructed on the site.

In addition to the Philippines and China, its ownership is also disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. = Naval Vessels = * The Philippine Navy's Jacinto class corvette, BRP Apolinario Mabini (PS-36), is also named after Mabini. = Philippine Peso = * Mabini's face adorns the Philippine ten peso coin, along with that of Andr√©s Bonifacio. **The newer series (New Generation Currency Series) only has Mabini. ** He was also featured on the ten peso bill that circulated or printed starting with the Pilipino Series in 1972 and continued until the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas stopped printing these notes (New Design series version) in 2002. From 1972 to 1997, he was the only one to portray on the front of the banknote until it added Andres Bonifacio that were printed from 1997 to 2002. = Government Awards and Citations = * The Gawad Mabini is awarded to Filipinos for distinguished foreign service, or promoting the interests and prestige of the Philippines abroad. It was established by Presidential Decree No. 490, s. 1974 in Mabini's honor since he was the first Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the First Philippine Republic. * The Philippine government presents the annual Apolinario Mabini Awards to outstanding persons with disabilities.

Even President Benigno Aquino III remarked on the implications of the lack of awareness among students, saying \\"even if only a few students said this, we can say that this is a reflection of how little some of the youth know about history. Later, I will call up (Education Secretary) Armin (Luistro) to act on this.\\" * Po-on (in English: \\"Dusk\\"): In this abstract and enigmatic novel, Apolinario Mabini visited Rosales, Pangasinan, which was adapted by writer F.

The northern extent of this range is the sub-range the Snowy Range. From the northern end of Colorado's Never Summer Mountains, the Medicine Bow mountains extend north from Cameron Pass along the border between Larimer and Jackson counties in Colorado and northward into south central Wyoming. In Wyoming, the range sits west of Laramie, in Albany and Carbon counties to the route of the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Interstate 80. The mountains often serve as a symbol for the city of Laramie. The range is home to Snowy Range Ski Area. The highest peak in the range is Clark Peak (), located in Rawah Wilderness and is along the southern end of the range in Northern Colorado. Much of the range is located within the Medicine Bow National Forest in Wyoming. The highest peak on the Wyoming side is Medicine Bow Peak (). The range is drained along the western flank by the Michigan and Canadian rivers, tributaries of the North Platte in North Park. On its eastern flank it is drained by the Laramie River, another tributary of the North Platte. Geology Medicine Bow Peak The Medicine Bow Mountains resulted from continental compression during the Laramide Orogeny. Beginning about 70 million years ago, the Rockies began uplifting along thrust faults that broke up the Precambrian granite of Earth's crust. By 50 million years ago, all of Wyoming's major mountain ranges were elevated and the major basins defined. Rocks exposed along the flanks and peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains span the Precambrian to modern, with the peaks composed of 2.4-2.0 billion year old Medicine Peak Quartzite. This rock was once a shallow marine sand deposit that has since been compressed and heated during burial, forming the metamorphic rock, quartzite. What may be traces of multicellular animals are preserved in this rock, making it of particular interest to paleontologists. The Cheyenne belt, the 1.78‚Äì1.74 billion year old suture between the Wyoming craton and the Yavapai province that formed as North America was assembled, is exposed in the Medicine Bow Mountains. Fauna Wildlife abounds in these mountains, with mule deer, elk, moose, black bear, mountain lions, coyotes, marmots, pika, Richardson's ground squirrels, bobcats, and lynx as well as a tremendous variety of birds. Brook and rainbow trout as well as grayling and golden trout are found in the streams. A disjunct population of arctic fairy shrimp (Brachinecta paludosa) has been documented in a few lakes in the northern part of the range. Research Lorraine Lindsley at the Medicine Bow Range, 1921 Since 1987, the Glacier Lakes area of the Snowy Range has been home to the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site (GLEES), a field unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, United States Forest Service.http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_rm/rm_gtr249.html Areas of scientific inquiry at the site include atmospheric pollutant deposition, forest carbon and water vapor cycling, effect of insect outbreaks, and alpine lake and stream hydrology. The site is 642 ha in extent and hosts facilities for the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), the National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN) and AmeriFlux (Eddy covariance). Airline crash This mountain range is also home to some of the remains of a Douglas DC-4 aircraft, operated as United Airlines Flight 409. The aircraft crashed into Medicine Bow Peak on October 6, 1955, killing all 66 people on board.

Mollisols form in semi-arid to semi-humid areas, typically under a grassland cover. They are most commonly found in the mid-latitudes, namely in North America, mostly east of the Rocky Mountains, in South America in Argentina (Pampas) and Brazil, and in Asia in Mongolia and the Russian Steppes. Their parent material is typically base-rich and calcareous and include limestone, loess, or wind-blown sand. The main processes that lead to the formation of grassland Mollisols are melanisation, decomposition, humification and pedoturbation. Mollisols have deep, high organic matter, nutrient-enriched surface soil (A horizon), typically between 60 and 80 cm in depth. This fertile surface horizon, known as a mollic epipedon, is the defining diagnostic feature of Mollisols. Mollic epipedons result from the long-term addition of organic materials derived from plant roots, and typically have soft, granular soil structure. Mollisols occur in savannahs and mountain valleys (such as Central Asia, or the North American Great Plains). These environments have historically been strongly influenced by fire and abundant pedoturbation from organisms such as ants and earthworms. It was estimated that in 2003, only 14 to 26 percent of grassland ecosystems still remained in a relatively natural state (that is, they were not used for agriculture due to the fertility of the A horizon). Globally, they represent ~7% of ice-free land area. As the world's most agriculturally productive soil order, the Mollisols represent one of the more economically important soil orders. Though most of the other soil orders known today existed by the time of the Carboniferous Ice Age 280 million years ago, Mollisols are not known from the paleopedological record any earlier than the Eocene. Their development is very closely associated with the cooling and drying of the global climate that occurred during the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene.  Suborders  :Albolls‚Äîwet soils; aquic soil moisture regime with an eluvial horizon :Aquolls‚Äîwet soils; aquic soil moisture regime :Cryolls‚Äîcold climate; frigid or cryic soil temperature regime :Gelolls‚Äîvery cold climate; mean annual soil temperature < 0 ¬∞C :Rendolls‚Äîlime parent material :Udolls‚Äîhumid climate; udic moisture regime :Ustolls‚Äîsubhumid climate; ustic moisture regime :Xerolls‚ÄîMediterranean climate; xeric moisture regime Soils which are in most ways similar to Mollisols but contain either continuous or discontinuous permafrost and are consequently affected by cryoturbation are common in the high mountain plateaux of Tibet and the Andean altiplano. Such soils are known as Molliturbels or Mollorthels and provide the best grazing land in such cold climates because they are not acidic like many other soils of very cold climates. Other soils which have a mollic epipedon are classified as Vertisols because the presence of high shrink swell characteristics and relatively high clay contents takes precedence over the mollic epipedon. These are especially common in parts of South America in the Paran√° River basin that have abundant but erratic rainfall and extensive deposition of clay-rich minerals from the Andes. Mollic epipedons also occur in some Andisols but the andic properties take precedence. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), Mollisols are split up into Chernozems, Kastanozems and Phaeozems. Shallow or gravelly Mollisols may belong to the Leptosols. Many Aquolls are Gleysols, Stagnosols or Planosols. Mollisols with a natric horizon belong to the Solonetz.

The principal disadvantage is that it can be considered crude or unhygienic and dangerous to health and the environment ‚Äì it litters the railway lines and can convey serious health risks when the train passes over or under a navigable waterway. Passengers may be discouraged from flushing or using toilets while the train is at a station or standing at a red signal. To enforce this limitation, toilets may be automatically locked when the train pulls into a station or stops at a red signal. In the United States, railway employees were required to lock the toilets closed whenever a passenger train stood in a station or at any other location designated by instructions in the timetable. Toilets would promptly be unlocked upon departure. Properly-designed drop chute toilets will draw air like a chimney, pulling air through the lavatory door vents and down and out through the toilet, reducing odor. Hopper toilets are similar to old- fashioned sea toilets in that they release the excreta directly to the environment, untreated. In the UK, at the end of 2019, hopper toilets on timetabled passenger services remained in use. A plan to protect all rail workers and reduce public health risks was delayed with several operators applying for waivers. Chemical holding tank Chemical holding tanks (retention tanks) are usually included on newer carriages and railcars in wealthier and more densely populated parts of the world. One issue is that the tanks need to be regularly emptied, often at a terminal station or prolonged stop-over. If a train needs to be used again quickly, the tanks may not get emptied. In this case, toilets may back up, which can result in toilets being closed. Vacuum toilet Vacuum systems used in the newest carriages are similar to those in airliners: waste is pulled into a holding tank with a high pressure pump. Their disadvantages are the same as of chemical holding tanks, in addition they require stable power supply for working, and flushing of anything else but water and human waste (e.g. toilet paper) can easily break the pump. Composting toilet Some trains may have composting toilet tanks, which use bacterial action to break down solid and liquid waste. Only the broken down clean liquid is released to the trackbed after sterilisation. The solid waste only has to be emptied every half year. This type of toilet is in use in some trains in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

A sharply winding canyon, it was formed by the Ohinemuri River. State Highway 2 passes through this gorge between the towns of Paeroa, Waikino and Waihi. This road is the main link between the Waikato region and the Bay of Plenty. The East Coast Main Trunk Railway used to run through the gorge until it was bypassed by the Kaimai Deviation - and the Karangahake Gorge section is now a combined walkway and cycleway, part of the Hauraki Rail Trail. Remains of Woodstock battery There are also several walks and tracks starting at the Karangahake Reserve car park and picnic area; ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours.  Mining  \\"Settlement of Karangahake\\" including gold mining buildings in centre, circa 1916 The area has a strong connection to mining, and even in the 2010s, a number of companies have been prospecting and mining the area, though with much less visible and invasive methods than were used historically. The Talisman, Crown and Woodstock stamping battery remains at the lower end of the gorge are some of the most significant reminders of the time. Their location at the confluence of the Waitawheta River and the Ohinemuri River was chosen to make use of the available water power of the rivers. Mining at the batteries occurred roughly from the 1880s to 1950s, with the most productive years around the turn of the century, when the area produced 60 percent of the total gold from New Zealand. The batteries used to crush the ore from the extensive tunnels mined through the steep local mountainsides of the Waitawheta Gorge, with the Victoria Battery one of the largest and most advanced at the time. Walks At Karangahake, several walks and tracks ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours start at the Karangahake Reserve car park and picnic area. One of the most spectacular walks in the area is the \\"Windows Walk\\", a loop walk that leads through the old gold mining tunnels of the Talisman Mine, crosses the Waitawheta River over a suspension bridge, and joins the Crown Tramway Track back along the cliffs of the Waitawheta Gorge. The path follows the route of a bush tramway and passes by \\"windows\\" in the cliff face at the end of mining tunnels, which were used to tip tailings down into the Waitawheta Gorge. Two of the mining tunnels, which are about tall and wide, are safe to enter. They end abruptly after about and are home to glowworms and cave weta. The Woodstock Underground Pumphouse in the Waitawheta Gorge is also still accessible via a short detour from the Crown Tramway Track. The East Coast Main Trunk Railway used to run through the gorge until it was bypassed by the Kaimai Deviation. The Karangahake Gorge section of the line, including a 1100-metre tunnel, is now a combined walkway and cycleway, part of the Hauraki Rail Trail, and together with the natural sights of the gorge, makes it into a well-visited local tourist attraction.

It was a , combining the functions of three logistic support ships in one hull - fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AF). History USS Camden refueling during the Vietnam War. Camden was commissioned on 1 April 1967 as the second of four vessels in its class. It was also the 542nd and final contract in the 68-year history of New York Shipbuilding, and the last vessel completed and launched at the shipyard. It was assigned to the Pacific Fleet in September 1967 and was initially homeported in Long Beach, California. For their accomplishments during her first deployment to WestPac in 1968‚Äì1969, her crew was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. In August 1974, Camden moved to its new homeport of Bremerton, Washington. The ship operated extensively up and down the West Coast of the United States and deployed frequently to the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans to support units of the Seventh Fleet. In 1980, Camden moved again to the homeport of Bremerton, Washington for an overhaul. On 20 July 1983 The New York Times reported that Camden along with seven other vessels in the Ranger Carrier Battle Group left San Diego on Friday 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer. The battle group comprised the carrier , the cruiser , the guided missile destroyer Lynde McCormick, the destroyers and , the frigate , the oiler and the support ship Camden. On 17 May 1987 USS Camden was redirected to assist after it was attacked by unfriendly fire. USS Camdens job was to unload all of the weapons on board Stark in case of further attack. On 15 August 1991 four airmen from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 11 (HC-11 \\"Gunbearers\\") were missing and presumed dead after their helicopter crashed while resupplying ships in the Pacific Ocean east Wake Island. Search efforts were abandoned about 24 hours later for the Sea Knight, which had been operating from Camden. Two ships were close by when the aircraft dropped into the water. Two helicopters were immediately launched for an air search, and the ships in the area launched whaleboats to assist in the search. Camden was deployed to resupply the aircraft carrier and support ships, which were returning to the U.S. from duty in the Persian Gulf after taking part in Operation Desert Storm. In March 1996, Camden was awarded its third consecutive Battle \\"E\\" for demonstrating excellence in all warfare and mission categories. In October 2000, Camden participated in Operation Determined Response, providing rescue assistance and hospitality services in support of in the Yemeni port of Aden damaged in a terrorist attack. In 2004, Camden won the Battle \\"E\\" again. This was the final year of Battle \\"E\\" eligibility for the Sacramento-class fast combat support ship. In January 2005, Camden left on its final deployment, an eight-month world tour with escorting that carrier to its new homeport in Norfolk, Virginia. Camden was decommissioned 14 October 2005 at Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, Washington, and was disposed of by scrapping at Esco Marine, in Brownsville, Texas. Power plant Camdens power plant was one of two built for the Iowa-class battleship , which was cancelled in 1947 when 72.1 percent complete. The other Kentucky power plant was used to power USS Sacramento, the lead ship of her class.

The proposal was floated by the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations.  History  The proposal was inspired by complaints of NATO countries that the nuclear defense of Europe was beholden to the Americans, who held the bulk of nuclear capability. The proposed fleet of warships would be manned and operated by NATO command, instead of an assortment of independent forces ultimately under their own national banners. In this way, other NATO powers were theoretically ensured an active role in European defense.Bouwmann, Bastiaan. Present at the Undoing: The Netherlands and the Multilateral Force, Nuclear Proliferation International History Project, 5 November 2013. Web. 5 November 2013. The idea of using surface ships as part of the force received criticism in Europe, who felt that surface ships would be vulnerable to attack, while a wholly submarine force would be more difficult to eliminate. President Kennedy argued that using only submarines would defeat the purpose of minimizing American control of the force, as the United States was the primary power capable of building the requisite number of submarines and training their crews. Including surface vessels would allow for greater European involvement in both construction and training, argued Kennedy, who also dismissed the notion that an entire pan-Europe nuclear-armed fleet could be eliminated before any of them could commit retaliatory strikes. The proposal eventually fell flat when American and European differences over basing strategies and financing could not be reconciled. The Italian cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi was actually refitted with four launchers for Polaris missiles. Despite the successful launching tests, the U.S. never went ahead with the MLF. Instead the Italian government set out to develop an indigenous nuclear weapons program, with a successful missile called Alfa, officially halted by Italian Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ratification. The prospect of having West Germany in the Multilateral Force was mocked by Tom Lehrer in the satirical song \\"MLF Lullaby\\". MLF experiment on USS Claude V. Ricketts From June 1964 to the end of 1965 was part of a mixed-manning experiment for the proposed MLF. Its crew consisted of 10 officers and 164 crew from the US Navy with the remainder (normally 24 officers and 330 enlisted) filled by sailors from West Germany, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Though the MLF never was created, Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze stated that the project on Claude V. Ricketts was successful.Lundquist, Edward. Sea Classics.

Twenty six individuals were captured, including three targeted individuals, Saad Mohammed ad-Douri, the private secretary of Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri, and Hamid Saad, a senior official of Saddam Hussein's former ruling Ba'ath Party in charge of youth and student affairs, and a former general of the disbanded Iraqi Army. Operation Bayonet Lightning followed Operation Rifles Blitz and was followed by Operation Bulldog Mammoth.

He was the son of King Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon (reigned c. 655 - 682) and the father of King Rhodri Molwynog (died 754). William Wynne places Cynan Dindaethwy as his son, but other sources have Cynan as the son of Rhodri. The records of this era are scanty, and Idwal's name appears only in the pedigrees of later kings and in a prophecy found in two 14th-century Welsh manuscripts, which says that he will succeed his father Cadwaladr as king. The only mention of Idwal Iwrch in the historical record is the appearance of his name in genealogies such as those from Jesus College MS. 20 (as the father of \\"Rhodri Molwynog son of Idwal Iwrch son of Cadwaladr Fendigiad\\"); the pedigree is given as: ... Cynan tintaeth6y. M. Rodri mol6yna6c. M. Idwal I6rch. M. Kadwaladyr vendigeit. M. Katwalla6n. M. Kad6ga6n. M. Iago. M. Beli. M. Run hir. M. Maelg6n g6yned ..., and from there back to Cunedda. and the Harleian genealogies (as the father of \\"Rotri son of Intguaul son of Catgualart\\").; on pages 169 - 170 the pedigree is given as: ... map Rotri map mermin map etthil merch cinnan map rotri map Intguaul map Catgualart map Catgollaun map Catman ..., and from there back to Cunedda and his ancestors. John Davies' History of Wales does not mention Idwal, while John Edward Lloyd's History says only that Idwal was Rhodri Molwynog's father. The King of Gwynedd during Idwal's lifetime is not known, and while he is one of the most likely candidates (because he was both the son of a king and the father of a king), there is no sufficiently reliable basis to either assert or deny it. Idwal's name appears in the Dialogue between Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd (), a Middle Welsh vaticinatory poem whose text is preserved in two medieval Welsh manuscripts, Peniarth 3 (c. 1300) and the Red Book of Hergest (c. 1380-1410).Meic Stephens (ed.), Cydymaith i Lenyddiaeth Cymru (University of Wales Press, revised edition 1992), p. 105. In the text's question-answer form, a succession of \\"future\\" kings is prophesied, with Idwal among them. This succession agrees with the historical genealogies from father to son, but does not agree with the known royal succession. -- for example, Cadwallon was the father of Cadwaladr, but Cadafael followed Cadwallon in the royal succession and Cadwaladr followed Cadafael, not as the prophecy claims.

The purpose of toss bombing is to compensate for the gravity drop of the bomb in flight, and allow an aircraft to bomb a target without flying directly over it. This is in order to avoid overflying a heavily defended target, or in order to distance the attacking aircraft from the blast effects of a nuclear (or conventional) bomb. Bomb tactics =Pop-up= In pop-up bombing, the pilot approaches from low altitude in level flight, and on cues from the computer pulls up at the last moment to release the bomb. Release usually occurs between 20¬∞ and 75¬∞ above the horizontal, causing the bomb to be tossed upward and forward, much like an underarm throw of a ball. =Level toss= Although \\"pop-up\\" bombing is generally characterized by its low-level approach, the same technique of a toss starting from level flight can be used at any altitude when it is not desirable to overfly the target. Additional altitude at release gives the bomb additional time of flight and range, at the cost (in the case of unguided munitions) of accuracy due to windage and the increased effect of a slight deviation in flight path. =Dive toss= The Dive-toss delivery technique was the first \\"toss\\" bombing method developed after WWII at the US Navy's rocket development center at Inyokern, California in 1947 as a method to attack heavily defended targets without unduly endangering the attacking aircraft.\\"Smash Hits\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1947, p. 113, see texts p. 115. Although toss bombing might seem the direct opposite to dive bombing, where the plane pitches downward to aim at its target, toss bombing is often performed with a short dive before the bomber raises its nose and releases its bomb. This variant is known as \\"dive tossing\\". This gives both the bomb and aircraft extra momentum, thereby helping the aircraft regain altitude after the release and also ensuring that airspeed at the calculated release point is still sufficient to get the bomb to the target. =Over-the-shoulder= A more dynamic variant of toss bombing, called over-the-shoulder bombing, or the LABS (Low Altitude Bombing System) maneuver (known to pilots as the \\"idiot's loop\\"), is a particular kind of loft bombing where the bomb is released past the vertical so it is tossed back toward the target. This tactic was first made public on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B-47 entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under automatic control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target.Knaack, Marcelle Size, Post-World War II Bombers, 1945‚Äì1973. Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1988, , p. 138. Author and retired USAF F-84 pilot Richard Bach describes such an attack in his book Stranger to the Ground: > The last red-roofed village flashes below me, and the target, a pyramid of > white barrels, is just visible at the end of its run-in line.

Tactical use Toss bombing is generally used by pilots whenever it is not desirable to overfly the target with the aircraft at an altitude sufficient for dive-bombing or level bombing. Such cases include heavy anti-air defenses such as AAA and SAMs, when deploying powerful weapons such as \\"iron bombs\\" or even tactical nuclear bombs, and the use of limited-aspect targeting devices for guided munitions. To counter air defenses en route to the target, remaining at a low altitude for as long as possible allows the bomber to avoid radar and visual tracking and the launch envelope of older missile systems designed to be fired at targets overflying the missile site. However, a level pass at the target at low altitude will not only expose the aircraft to short- range defenses surrounding the target, but will place the aircraft in the bomb's blast radius. By executing a \\"pop-up\\" loft, on the other hand, the pilot releases the munition well outside the target area, out of range of air defenses. After release, the pilot can either dive back to low altitude or maintain the climb, in either case generally executing a sharp turn or \\"slice\\" away from the target. The blast produced by powerful munitions is thus (hopefully) avoided. The value of toss-bombing was increased with the introduction of precision-guided munitions such as the laser-guided bomb. Previous \\"dumb bombs\\" required a very high degree of pilot and fire control computer precision to loft the bomb accurately to the target. Unguided loft bombing also generally called for the use of a larger bomb than would be necessary for a direct hit, in order to generate a larger blast that would destroy the target even if the bomb did not hit accurately due to windage or computer/pilot error. Laser-targeting (and other methods like GPS as used in the JDAM system) allows the bomb to correct minor deviations from the intended ballistic path after it has been released, making toss-bombing as accurate as level bombing while still providing most of the advantages of toss-bombing using unguided munitions. However, the targeting pods used to deliver guided munitions generally have a limit to their field of view; most specifically, the pod usually cannot look behind the aircraft at more than a certain angle. Lofting the bomb allows the pilot to keep the target in front of the aircraft and thus within the targeting pod's field of view for as long as possible. \\"Dive-tossing\\" is generally used at moderate altitude (to allow for the dive) when the target, for whatever reason, cannot be designated precisely by radar. A target for instance may present too small a signature to be visible on radar (such as the entrance to an underground bunker) or may be indistinguishable in a group of radar returns. The pilot can in this case use a special \\"boresight\\" mode that allows the pilot to designate a target by pointing his aircraft directly at it. For a target on the ground, this means entering a dive. Thus designated, the pilot can then begin a climb, lofting the bomb at the target from a distance and regaining lost altitude at the same time. Technology Due to the intense pilot workload involved with flying and entering the window of opportunity, some aircraft are equipped with a ‚ÄúToss Bomb Computer‚Äù (in US nuclear delivery, a part of the Low Altitude Bombing System) that enables the pilot to release the bomb at the correct angle. The Toss Bomb Computer takes airspeed inputs from the aircraft's pitot system, altitude inputs from the static system, attitude inputs from the gyroscopic system and inputs from weapons selectors signifying the type of bomb to calculate the appropriate release point of the ordnance. Instead of triggering the release directly, the pilot instead \\"consents\\" to release the weapon, then begins a steady climb. The computer then calculates the desired ballistic path, and when that path will be produced by the current aircraft attitude and airspeed, the computer releases the bomb. During the Second World War the engineers Erik Wilkenson and Torsten Fax√©n at Saab developed the first bomb sight for toss bombing. It was a mechanical computer that did the necessary calculations. It was first used in the Saab 17 and was standard on all Saab fighters up to and including Saab 32 Lansen. It was also sold to France, Switzerland, Denmark and USA and was used in for instance the Boeing B-47 Stratojet.Ny Teknik: Svenskt bombsikte blev en v√§rldshit While deployed in Europe with NATO, RCAF CF-104 fighter-bombers carried a Toss Bomb Computer until their nuclear role was eliminated by the Canadian government effective 1 January 1972. The same computational solutions used in the LABS system are now incorporated into two of the major bombing modes (the computer-controlled CCRP and a dedicated visually oriented \\"Dive-Toss\\" mode) of the Fire Control Computer of modern strike fighters such as the F-15E and F-16. As with LABS, the pilot designates their desired impact point, then consents to release while executing a climb, and the computer controls the actual release of the bomb. The integration into the FCC simplifies the pilot's workload by allowing the same bombing mode (CCRP) to be used for level, dive and loft bombing, providing similar cues in the pilot's displays regardless of the tactics used, since the computer simply sees it as the release point getting closer.

O. C. Darley In Kansas, Border Ruffians was the name applied to pro-slavery settlers from the slave state of Missouri, who from 1854 to 1860 crossed the state border into Kansas Territory to force the acceptance of slavery there. Armed Ruffians interfered in territorial elections, and attacked Free-State settlements. This violence was the origin of the phrase \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". The Ruffians contributed to the growing sectional tensions, and helped bring on the American Civil War. The Ruffians were driven by the rhetoric of leaders such as U.S. Senator David Rice Atchison (D-Missouri) who called Northerners \\"negro thieves\\" and \\"abolitionist tyrants\\". He encouraged Missourians to defend their institution \\"with the bayonet and with blood\\" and, if necessary, \\"to kill every God-damned abolitionist in the district.\\" Notably, only a few of the Border Ruffians actually owned slaves; most were too poor. What motivated them was hatred of Yankees and abolitionists, and fear of free blacks living nearby. The presence of bands of both Kansan and Missourian combatants in the area made it difficult for families on the border to remain neutral. \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" Kansas Territory was created by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854. The Act repealed the previous Federal prohibition on slavery in that area. Instead, the locally elected territorial legislature would decide. At this time, many (probably most) of the settlers in Kansas opposed slavery. However, slavery advocates were determined to have their way regardless. When elections were held in Kansas Territory, bands of armed Ruffians seized polling places, prevented Free-State men from voting, and cast votes themselves (illegally, since they were Missourians). On November 29, 1854, Border Ruffians elected a pro-slavery territorial representative to Congress. On March 30,1855, the Ruffians elected a pro-slavery legislature. Despite these measures, far more Free-State settlers moved to Kansas than pro- slavery settlers. In 1857, pro-slavery settlers in Kansas proposed the Lecompton Constitution for the future state of Kansas. The Ruffians tried to get the Lecompton Constitution adopted with additional fraud and violence, but by then there were too many Free-Staters there. The Border Ruffians also engaged in general violence against Free-State settlements. They burned farms and sometimes murdered Free-State men. Most notoriously, the Ruffians twice attacked Lawrence, Kansas, the Free-State capital. On December 1, 1855, a small army of mainly Border Ruffians laid siege to Lawrence, but were driven off. (This was the nearly bloodless climax to the \\"Wakarusa War\\".) On May 21, 1856, an even larger force of Border Ruffians and pro-slavery Kansans captured Lawrence, which they sacked. Free-State settlers sometimes struck back. Free- State irregulars (known as Jayhawkers, Redlegs, or Redleggers) attacked pro- slavery settlers and suspected Ruffian sympathizers. Most notoriously, abolitionist John Brown killed five pro-slavery men at Pottawatomie. Thomas Wentworth Higginson became a founding member of the Kansas Aid Committee in the summer of 1856. During the guerrilla war in the Kansas Territory between proslavery and antislavery settlers, the committee worked to recruit abolitionist settlers, raised funds for them to migrate to Kansas, and equipped them with rifles to use against the ‚ÄúBorder Ruffians.‚Äù During the Civil War During the Civil War, the violence in this area not only continued, but escalated tremendously. Many of the former Ruffians became pro- Confederate guerrillas. They operated in western Missouri, sometimes raiding into Kansas, and Union forces campaigned to suppress them. Farms were burned and looted. Suspected guerrillas were killed; guerrillas killed Union sympathizers and suspected informers. (See Bushwhacker.) Many of the Union troops involved were Kansas Jayhawkers, and had deep grudges against Missourians. Jayhawkers destroyed several towns in Missouri, such as Osceola. The destruction of Osceola is depicted in the movie The Outlaw Josey Wales.  See also  * William T.

Her first South Indian film was the Malayalam film Indraprastham opposite Mammootty. In 1997, she appeared in her Kannada debut Simhada Mari, opposite Shivarajkumar. Prior to her debut in Tamil films, Simran was associated with two projects which failed to materialize in 1996, Parthiepan's Soththukatchi and Bharathiraja's Siragugal Murivadhillai. Her Tamil cinema debut was in 1997, marked with films Once More and V. I. P.. But she signed her first Tamil movie with multi- starrer Nerukku Ner. Yet the former two projects were released prior to the release of Nerukku Ner and earned her recognition. In Once More she played the love-interest of Vijay along with veteran actors Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi directed by S. A. Chandrasekhar. The film was a box office hit and stated that the film was a commercial family entertainer. And in V. I. P. she was seen opposite Prabhu Deva along with Abbas and Rambha, directed by D. Sabhapathi. The song \\"Minnal Oru Kodi\\" picturized with Prabhu Deva and Simran becoming a chartbuster and all-time hit for the actors. The film had no scope of performance and a critic noted as \\"Thankfully, not much is required from Abbas or Simran in the acting department.\\" Both the movies emerged her to fetch Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut ‚Äì South for the year. For Nerukku Ner she played opposite to Suriya (in his debut) and produced by director Mani Ratnam. = Success and stardom (1998‚Äì1999) = Following successful debuts in Tamil and Telugu films, in 1998 she had her first release in K. S. Ravikumar's Kondattam, opposite Arjun, which is a commercial failure. But she tasted the success in her other successful movies such as Natpukkaga (1998), Aval Varuvala (1998) and Kannedhirey Thondrinal (1998) with leading actors Sarath Kumar, Ajith Kumar and Prashanth respectively. In Natpukkaga, she again team up with director K. S. Ravikumar paired opposite Sarath Kumar, the movie won several awards including Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Tamil. Simran's role as modern belle Prabavati who takes revenge on Chinnayya (Sarath Kumar) for her mother's murder was praised by reviewers. Another success with Ajith Kumar in Aval Varuvala, a Tamil remake of the 1997 Telugu film Pelli. Her role as women suffers from adultery by her husband, was well received by the critics, \\"Simran proves that she can act too and most of her lip-sync is appreciable\\". Her next film was Kannedhirey Thondrinal directed by Ravichandran. For the first time, she paired with Prashanth. The success of the movie later led them to be paired in successful movies like Jodi, Parthen Rasithen and Thamizh. Her positive feedback got critical acclaim for her performance. She also appeared in a supporting role with Akkineni Nagarjuna and Deepti Bhatnagar in Telugu Movie Auto Driver a commercial failure. In 1999 all her movies became highly successful ventures and the year was the luckiest for the actress. Her first Tamil release for the year is Thulladha Manamum Thullum, opposite Vijay. The film had a theatrical run for more than 200 days in theatres at Tamil Nadu. As a blind woman, she was highly appreciated for her performance in the film. She received Tamil Nadu State Award for Best Actress. Behindwoods noted her performance as one of the best blind roles ever played by an actor in Tamil cinema. The film was later remade in Telugu as Nuvvu Vastavani and she reprised her role again on the requisition of the actor Akkineni Nagarjuna. Her next release opposite Ajith Kumar is Vaali, it tells the story of Deva and Shiva, two look-alike siblings, with Deva being deaf and dumb. When Shiva marries his sweetheart Priya, Deva becomes obsessed with and lusts for Priya (played by Simran). The New Indian Express labelled Simran's portrayal as \\"Outstanding\\". The film ran for more than 200 days and was a box office hit. Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan dated 16 May 1999 praised the film by giving 45 marks and mentioned \\"Simran proved that she can act well than her contemporaries\\". for which she won Cinema Express Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Tamil. She revealed that after working on the film, she became \\"alert in her choice of films\\", only signing ventures which had big production banners. Another successful feather in her cap is Jodi, with Prashanth. The film opened in September 1999 to positive reviews and became an average. Her role joyful Brahmin girl appreciated by critics. Her next film was Kanave Kalaiyadhe with Murali, in which she played dual roles as bubbly Punjabi girl falls for south Indian boy (played by Murali) and a matured south Indian Brahmin girl, also gained mixed reviews. This is the only film where she played a dual role in her entire cinema career. Kannupada Poguthaiya with Vijayakanth was her next where she played a village belle who forced to marry the brother of the man she loves, which was an average. She then played a woman left alone in a joint family in Time opposite Prabhu Deva. The same year she did \\"Thottu Thottu Pesum\\" in Edhirum Pudhirum and \\"Maana Madhura\\" in Anthapuram items numbers and both were chartbusters.

It involved dropping paratroopers into Northern Iraq. It was the last large-scale combat parachute operation conducted by the U.S. military since Operation Just Cause. Background On 26 March 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, C-17s of the 62d Airlift Wing, 315th Airlift Wing, 437th Airlift Wing, and 446th Airlift Wing dropped SETAF's 173rd Airborne Brigade into Northern Iraq. 996 paratroopers jumped into the Bashur drop zone (). The operation forced the Iraqi Army to maintain approximately six divisions in the area to protect its northern flank, providing strategic relief for Coalition Forces advancing on Baghdad from the south. Bashur Airfield is located in northern Iraq approximately 356 kilometers North of Baghdad, 50 kilometers Northeast of Erbil. The airbase is served by a single 6,700 foot long runway. Bashur appears to be a small civilian airport. Bashur is the epitome of a bare base. It was nothing more than a 7,000-foot runway in the middle of a green valley. It had no infrastructure - no water or sewage system and no electricity, buildings or paved roads. Operation U.S. Army paratroopers prepare to board a C-17 Globemaster III into the Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq. This was the first combat insertion of paratroopers using a C-17. On 26 Mar 2003, more than 950 paratroopers from the 173d Airborne Brigade jumped into Bashur, Iraq, to set the stage for a northern front. Two days later, the first soldier from the 501st Forward Support Company, 173d Airborne Brigade, Supply Support Activity (SSA) arrived at Bashur Airfield. The operation was classified as a combat jump by the Army, although the landing zone was secured by Kurdish and American forces. During the next two weeks at Bashur Airfield, all supplies arrived via the air lines of communication (ALOC) on C-17s and C-130s from Ramstein Air Base, Germany through Constanta Air Base, Romania. During an average 24-hour day of operations, more than 40 Air Force 463L ALOC pallets would arrive. Each pallet then had to be downloaded from the plane, transported to the SSA, processed and finally issued either to storage or to customers. Some of the C-17s carried huge M1-A Abrams tanks, and weighed from 250,000 to 300,000 pounds when they landed. After two weeks of use by heavy cargo planes, parts of Bashur's 7,000-foot runway crumbled, forcing the closure of 2,300 feet. Aftermath As of April 2003, Delta Battery 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment remained in Bashur, and continued training New Iraqi Army on key tasks which would be needed in to complete future operations in the region. Delta Battery also provided indirect fire support for coalition forces in the area when coalition forces came into contact with insurgents. A 20 April 2003 report in The New York Times asserted that \\"the U.S. is planning a long-term military relationship with the emerging government of Iraq, one that would grant the Pentagon access to military bases and project American influence into the heart of the unsettled region.\\" The report, citing anonymous sources, referred to one base at Baghdad's international airport, another near Al- Nasiriyah in the south [presumably meaning Tallil AB], the third at the H-1 airstrip in the western desert, and the fourth at Bashur AB in the north. Bashur Airbase is now known as Harir Airport.

He is a member of the Republican Party. Early life, education and career Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, the son of Margaret Ferrell (n√©e Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland. He grew up in Metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended Georgia State University, but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the US House in 2005. As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan gerrymandering during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He abandoned his opposition and was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005, after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections. U.S. House of Representatives =Tenure= During his first term in the 109th United States Congress, Westmoreland was appointed to the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, and the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.. In January 2015, the House Intelligence Committee was reorganized, and a subcommittee on Cybersecurity and the National Security Agency was created with Westmoreland appointed to be the subcommittee's first chairman. As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the Ten Commandments in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Westmoreland also sponsored a bill that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in courthouses in a historical setting. In May 2006, political humorist Stephen Colbert interviewed Westmoreland for The Colbert Report show segment Better Know a District, and during the interview, asked Westmoreland to name the Ten Commandments. Westmoreland was able to name only three of them. Govtrack.us ranked Westmoreland as tied for the most conservative member of the 112th Congress. Westmoreland led a group of congressmen who opposed the 2006 renewal of certain provisions in the Voting Rights Act that require nine Southern states and a number of counties (mostly in the South) to obtain Federal permission for certain changes to election law or changes in venue. Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting. Despite Westmoreland's objections, a strong bipartisan majority renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years without changes. In 2008, Westmoreland ran unopposed in the Republican primary and was re-elected after defeating his Democratic opponent Stephen Camp. After his win, Westmoreland announced that he was considering running for the office of Governor of Georgia in 2010, but later indicated in an April 2009 press release that he would not. In 2010 Westmoreland signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes. As of February 4, 2016, Westmoreland had the most conservative ideology score of any member of the House of Representatives in the 114th Congress according to GovTrack.\\"Analysis Methodology.\\" GovTrack.us.

Westmoreland said to reporters, \\"Just from what little I've seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity.\\" When asked to confirm his use of the word, Westmoreland answered, \\"Uppity, yeah.\\" The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: \\"I've never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteem‚Äîsnobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up.\\" During the national debate in 2015 over the future of the Confederate flag some Republicans proposed a moderate amendment to allow Confederate symbols at national cemeteries. Representative Lynn Westmoreland distinguished between racism and a memorial, When Westmoreland was asked if he understood Representative John Lewis' perspective, he responded, \\"I guess the question is, 'Does he understand where I'm coming from?'\\" Political campaigns Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was tantamount to election in November. He routed his Democratic opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. The district was renumbered as the 3rd in 2006 and made even more Republican than its predecessor. Westmoreland was reelected five more times from this district with no substantive opposition. Personal life He resides in Grantville, Georgia, with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren. His daughter, Marcy Sakrison, ran unsuccessfully in the 2019 special election for a seat the Georgia House of Representatives.

References Category:Crotalarieae Category:Flora of Africa ","title":"Wiborgia"},{"id":"1164063","text":"The Cimicidae are a family of small parasitic insects that feed exclusively on the blood of warm-blooded animals. They are called cimicids or, loosely, bed bugs, though the latter term properly refers to the most famous member of the family, Cimex lectularius, the common bed bug and its tropical relation Cimex hemipterus. The family contains over 100 species. Cimicids appeared in the fossil record in the Cretaceous period. When bats evolved in the Eocene, they switched hosts and now feed mainly on bats or birds. Members of the group have colonised humans on three separate occasions. Cimicids usually feed on their host's blood every three to seven days, crawling away from the host and hiding while they digest the blood, which may take several days. This means that they specialise in vertebrate hosts that return regularly to particular sites to nest, roost or sleep. Birds and bats suit these specific requirements, as do humans now that they live in dwellings, and these are the main hosts used by the bugs. Most cimicids are able to go for long periods without feeding, over a year in some instances. Cimicids are typically small, oval, flattened, wingless insects. They are stimulated to appear from their hiding places by cues such as a slight rise in the temperature of their surroundings. Among the family's distinctive characteristics are traumatic insemination, in which the male fertilises the eggs by piercing the female's abdominal wall with his intromittent organ. They also have distinctive paired structures called mycetomes inside their bodies, in which they harbour bacterial symbionts: these may help them to obtain nutrients they cannot get from blood. Although the insects may acquire viruses and other pathogens while feeding, these do not normally replicate inside the insect, and the infections are not transmitted to new hosts. Biology Cimex lectularius feeding on a bat All cimicids are small, oval-shaped, and flat in appearance, although their bodies bulge after feeding. They do not fly, but have small, non-functional wing pads. They have beak-like mouthparts with which they pierce the skin and suck the blood of their hosts. They are often considered to be ectoparasites because, although they move away from the host after feeding, they remain within the confines of their host's roost, nest or dwelling; however, under a different definition, they may be considered to be micropredatory bloodsuckers. Reproduction in cimicids involves traumatic insemination; although the female has a normal genital tract for laying eggs, the male never uses it (except in the species Primicimex cavernis), instead piercing the female's abdominal wall with his intromittent organ and injecting sperm into the spermalege, a storage structure; the sperm then migrate through the female's paragenital system to reach the eggs. This practice may have evolved as males competed with each other to place their sperm closer and closer to the ovaries; the last inseminating male sires more offspring than his predecessors. Males will mount any recently-fed bug, regardless of sex, and start probing its abdomen in the region of the spermalege, thus receiving tactile, morphological and behavioral cues revealing the sex of the mounted bug. Females occasionally die from a ruptured gut after insemination; insemination via the female reproductive tract does not normally occur, except under restrictive laboratory conditions. Feeding is required for egg production in females and probably for sperm production in males. Egg-laying behavior varies among species. C. lectularius stops laying fertile eggs about 35 to 50 days after the last insemination. The American cliff swallow bug, Oeciacus vicarius, hibernates after mating in autumn and begins laying in spring, to coincide with the return of their migratory hosts. The five nymphal instars (stages) must each take a blood meal to develop to the next stage. An undisturbed bug may take 3‚Äì15 minutes to ingest a full meal depending on its life stage. They can survive long periods of time without feeding, reappearing from their hiding places when hosts again become available. Adult bedbugs have been reported to live three to twelve months in an untreated household situation. Behavior Cimicids are attracted to hosts by a variety of cues, including heat (even a temperature difference of 1 ¬∞C) and kairomones. Host cues (at least in some species, including C. lectularius and Stricticimex antennatus) change from attractants to repellants after a cimicid has fed, causing it to move out of a danger zone after feeding. Most cimicids feed once every three to seven days in natural conditions. C. lectularius normally feeds once every seven days and Ornithocoris toledoi every eight days, though C. hemipterus has been observed feeding every day for several days (in hot climates). Excessively hot or cold temperatures disrupt normal behavior. All cimicids harbour bacterial symbionts in paired structures known as \\"mycetomes\\". Although the significance of these has not been fully studied, they may be concerned with the biosynthesis of nutrients that the insect cannot synthesize itself, as is the case in other blood-sucking insects. Many cimicids can go without food for long periods, one and a half years in some instances. This allows them to survive the winter at summer bat roosts even when the bats are hibernating elsewhere, and may be an important adaptive trait because of their limited dispersal ability. Cimicids have occasionally been observed clinging to the fore limbs of bats away from the roost, and this is likely to be the means by which the insects disperse. The cimicids have no special adaptations to enable them to travel in this way, however the only two members of the Primicimicinae subfamily, Bucimex chilensis and Primicimex cavernis have claws and an erect a row of peg-like spines on the tarsus, and have been observed clinging to the bat's pelage with these. Hosts Oeciacus hirundinis feeds on swallows. Cimicids are a specialised group of blood- sucking parasites that primarily feed on bats, birds and humans. They are thought to have evolved from predatory heteropteran ancestors, with about 60% of extant species using bats as their primary hosts. Bats are social mammals and many species congregate in communal roosts to give birth and rear their young. These roosts provide excellent conditions for their arthropod ectoparasites, with a steady temperature and opportunities for regular blood meals. However, the bats frequently groom themselves and each other, putting the parasites at risk of being eaten. Cimicids lessen this risk by hiding in concealed locations between feeding bouts, and by producing a repellent substance which makes them distasteful. In evolutionary terms, most species of cimicid probably specialised on insectivorous bats or birds, with the possibility of dispersal to other sites via their winged hosts. On returning to a roost, a bat may only be available to cimicids for a short time before it cools down and enters a state of torpor, with reduced blood flow. When the bats lived in close proximity to humans, in caves or in the roofs of their huts, a new opportunity arose; the cimicids could make use of the large size and homeothermic properties of a human, which provided an abundant food supply that led to the growth and expansion of the ectoparasite populations. Cimicids are relatively specialized in their choice of hosts, compared to other bloodsucking insects. Most cimicids have a preferred host, but accept some others when presented with the choice, such as C. lectularius and C. hemipterus, which are most often found among humans, but can also survive by feeding on birds, bats, rabbits, and mice. The subfamilies Primicimicinae and Latrocimicinae use New World bats as their hosts, while Afrocimicinae and Cacodminae use Old World bats. Bats represent a convenient mammal to exploit as they roost communally, returning to the same roost regularly. It is perhaps to avoid the parasites that some species of bat regularly change roosts. The subfamily Haematosiphoninae use birds in the swift and swallow families, Apodidae and Hirundinidae. One species, P. cavernis, has a very limited distribution and appears to make use of only one species of host. Host switching is dependent on several factors, including overlap in host detection cues and ability to digest different kinds of blood. For example, the red blood cells of chickens are about 3 to 5 Œºm longer in diameter than those of humans, making human blood more suitable for the narrow food canal of C. lectularius. C. hemipterus may be able to vary the size of its food canal, allowing it greater flexibility in its choice of hosts. Preference for a host species can vary between populations of a given species; the causes for this are unclear. Effects on hosts The effects of cimicid feeding on the host include causing an immune response that results in discomfort, the transmission of pathogens, secondary infections at the wound site, physiological changes such as iron deficiency, and reduced fitness (slow growth, small size, or lack of reproductive success). Hosts can defend themselves against attack by choosing non-infected sites and by grooming, while cimicids can maximise their success by reducing feeding time, selecting feeding sites which are out of reach of the hosts grooming activities, choosing to feed at times when the host is inactive, and removing themselves to a safer environment promptly when satiated. Although viruses and other pathogens can be acquired by cimicids, they rarely transmit them to their hosts. O. vicarius is a vector of several arboviruses, but is not killed by these viruses. Trypanosoma cruzi, the trypanosome that causes Chagas disease, is rarely transmitted from cimicids to bats, but it has not been observed replicating after such transmission. The viruses HIV and hepatitis B can persist in C. lectularius for two weeks, but with no viral replication. The possibility of these and most other viruses being transmitted from C. lectularius to humans is considered extremely remote. Evolution A fossil bedbug, Quasicimex eilapinastes, was identified in 2008 from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber, aged 99 million years ago (mya). Molecular analysis of five mitochondrial and nuclear genes shows that the Cimicidae, a group of over 100 species, form a clade. The Primicimicinae is sister to the clade containing all other extant species. The analysis, dated using fossils, gives an estimated date of 115 mya, in the Cretaceous, for the evolution of the first Cimicidae. When bats appeared some 50 million years later, the parasites switched hosts, feeding on bats and birds from then on. The group colonised humans as hosts on three separate occasions. The genus Cimex is seen to be polyphyletic. Afrocimicinae, Haematosiphoninae, Latrocimicinae were not included in the analysis.

The genus is in the pea family Fabaceae. It is colloquially known as native broom after its resemblance to the related European broom plants. The Noongar peoples know the plant as koweda. Originally described in 1795 by Schrader as Sophora juncea, it was given its current binomial name by Hoffmannsegg in 1824. The genus name is derived from the Latin vimineus \\"switch\\", and the species name from Latin juncus \\"rush\\", hence \\"rush-like\\". Alternate names include golden spray, native broom and swishbush. Native broom grows as an erect or weeping shrub high and wide. It has a smooth trunk and ascending branches while the minor branchlets often droop. The long and thin leaves are essentially petioles and measure in length. Flowering occurs from September to January, the flowers growing on racemes to about in length. Measuring in diameter, they are yellow with an orange corolla and are typically pea-shaped. They are followed by small pods containing single seeds. The preferred habitat is swampy areas near the coast across southern Australia, from the vicinity of Geraldton in Western Australia southwards to Esperance, and in the east in coastal Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Native broom is a fast-growing plant in the garden, but can lose vigor once about 5 or 10 years old. It prefers an acidic to neutral soil with ample moisture and is hardy to temperatures of ‚àí4 ¬∞C. Plants grown from seed are sturdier than cutting-grown specimens.

A. Knox, 'Hotham, Sir Charles (1806‚Äì1855)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 4, MUP, 1972, pp 429-430. was Lieutenant-Governor and, later, Governor of Victoria, Australia from 22 June 1854 to 10 November 1855. Early life Hotham was born at Dennington, Suffolk, England the son of the Rev. Frederick Hotham, prebendary of Rochester, and his wife Anne Elizabeth n√©e Hodges. Hotham entered the navy on 6 November 1818, and had a distinguished career. He was in command of the steam sloop which ran aground in Montevideo Bay in May 1844 and showed skill and determination in getting her refloated by November that year. One of the lieutenants on board was the future Admiral Sir Astley Cooper Key. Hotham's last active service was as a commodore on the coast of Africa in 1846, in which year he was created K.C.B. In April 1852 he was appointed minister plenipotentiary on a mission to some of the South American republics. Australia Hotham was appointed lieutenant-governor of Victoria on 6 December 1853 by the Duke of Newcastle. Later, Hotham was made captain general and governor-in-chief. He was received with great enthusiasm when he landed at Melbourne on 22 June 1854, and there appeared to be every prospect of his being a popular governor. Hotham, however, found that the finances of the colony were in great disorder, there was a prospective deficiency of over ¬£1,000,000, and a bad system had grown up of advances being made to the various departments under the title of \\"imprests\\". Hotham wisely appointed a committee of two bankers and the auditor-general to inquire into the position, and this committee promptly advised the abolition of the \\"imprest\\" system. It was eventually found that under this system a sum of ¬£280,000 could not be accounted for. His efforts at retrenchment brought Hotham much unpopularity, but on questions of finance he was always sound and great improvements in this regard were made during his short term of office. Hotham was governor at the time of the Eureka Stockade. When Hotham became lieutenant-governor, replacing La Trobe, he enforced mining licensing laws. On 19 November 1854 he appointed a Royal Commission on goldfields problems and grievances. According to historian Geoffrey Blainey \\"It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\\" Hotham was a naval officer who had been used to strict discipline, and though he eventually realised that the arrogance of the officials who were administering the law was largely responsible for the trouble, when, on 25 November 1854, a deputation waited on him to demand the release of some diggers who had been arrested, he took the firm stand that a properly worded memorial would receive consideration, but none could be given to \\"demands\\". The rebellion which broke out at the Eureka stockade on 3 December 1854 was quickly subdued but the rebels arrested were all eventually acquitted. It was a time of great excitement in Melbourne, and the governor was convinced that designing men were behind the movement who hoped to bring about a state of anarchy. In these circumstances he felt that the only way of dealing with the trouble was the use of the strong hand. The first eye witness account of the Massacre at the Eureka Stockade in December 1854 was published just a year after the event, by Raffaello Carboni. He was a principal Rebel, multilingual and better educated than most. He was in no doubt that the man most responsible for the massacre was Lieutenant-Governor Charles Hotham. On 30 November 1854, Carboni, Father Smyth and George Black (newspaper editor), from the Central Council of the Eureka Rebels, asked Ballarat Goldfields Commissioner Rede to call off the licence hunts which had intensified on Hotham's secret orders and which were enraging miners. Rede said that 'the licence is a mere cloak to cover a democratic revolution'. Carboni wrote that Rede was 'only a marionette ‚Ä¶ before us. Each of his words, each of his movements, was the vibration of the telegraph wires directed from Toorak' (p. xiii). H. V. Evatt, an esteemed legal mind of mid 20th century puts the blame for the massacre on Hotham's deliberate duplicity (p.xvi). Carboni left the Stockade about midnight. He wrote that at that stage there was confidence about a resolution of the matter without bloodshed, but that was only because Hotham had told the miners and police and military, different things. No one was expecting an assault from the military and police Camp. He also wrote 'It was perfectly understood, and openly declared ‚Ä¶ that we meant to organise for defence, and that we had taken up arms for no other purpose'. (p. 67). And 'the spies being sent from the Camp to enrol themselves amongst the insurgents, and who, report says, urged them to attack the Camp, which was repudiated by the diggers - they saying they would act upon the defensive'. (p. 132). Carboni, with 18 others, was subsequently put on trial for his life. Hotham directed that American Rebels, some of whom were very prominent, not be prosecuted. He gave them an amnesty; but not quite all, the African American John Joseph was abandoned by Hotham and American officials. The prisoners appealed to Hotham, 'There is a paragraph in our petition to the effect, that if 'His Excellency had found sufficient extenuation in the conduct of American citizens', we thought there were equally good grounds for extending similar clemency to all, irrespective of nationality ‚Ä¶. it is a violation of the very principle enunciated by His Excellency in his report, viz.'That it is the duty of a Government to administer equal justice to all' (p. 134). There was a Royal Commission into the Massacre and Hotham wasn't blamed, probably because Hotham's critics were not heard. Hotham's post was raised to a full governorship on 3 February 1855. Though Hotham in all constitutional questions relied on his legal advisers his position was one of great difficulty. Constitutional government had been granted but not really effected, and it was not until 28 November 1855 that the first government under William Haines was formed. During this year Hotham, had been endeavouring to carry out the views of his finance committee, and was receiving much criticism from a section of the press. He was insistent that tenders for all works should be called through the Government Gazette, but not receiving support from the legislature, he ordered the stoppage of all constructional works. For some of his actions he was reprimanded by Sir William Molesworth, the secretary of state. Hotham then sent in his resignation in November 1855 and in doing so mentioned that his health had materially suffered. Later life Hotham was conscientious, but he had little experience to help him in dealing with the exceptionally difficult problems of his period of governorship. He has been severely criticized, but his work on the finances of the colony was of great value. Hotham, whose health was failing, caught a chill on 17 December 1855 while opening the Melbourne Gasworks; he died two weeks later on 31 December, and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery. In December 1853, he had married Jane Sarah, daughter of Samuel Hood Lord Bridport. She survived him Legacy Several places have been named after him, most notably: * Mount Hotham * the town of Hotham (now North Melbourne) * the federal Division of Hotham * the Sir Charles Hotham Hotels in Melbourne and Geelong * roads including Hotham Streets in Preston, Collingwood, East Melbourne, Traralgon, Cranbourne, Hughesdale, Lake Wendouree, Lower Templestowe and Seddon; Hotham Road, Niddrie; and Hotham Avenue in Mount Macedon.

Publication history Warlock was introduced in New Mutants #18 (Aug 1984) and was created by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz. He joined the titular superteam in issue #21, and remained a part of the cast until he was killed off in issue #95. Warlock briefly starred in his own self-titled series for nine issues from 1999 to 2000, written by Louise Simonson (who had previously been responsible for killing off the original Technarchy Warlock) and drawn by Paschalis Ferry. Fictional character biography =New Mutant= Warlock is a member of the alien Technarchy, a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the \\"techno-organic\\" transmode virus, before draining the life energy (\\"lifeglow\\") of the infected organism. Unlike others of his race, Warlock possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result was dubbed a mutant in spirit; It was later discovered that he is in fact a mutant of his raceNew Mutants #74 even though he has yet to display any abilities beyond those natural to the Technarch. He is the son of the Technarch ruler who has battled the New Mutants and the X-Men. Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group's existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Cypher (Doug Ramsey). Because of Warlock's compassion, he refuses to drain other sentient creatures of their \\"lifeglow\\". Because of the difficulty in determining whether or not a creature is sentient, New Mutants leader Danielle Moonstar ordered him not to drain any large creatures without permission; however, Warlock often drains such creatures at his discretion when Danielle is not present.New Mutants Special Edition #1, 1985 During many adventures, Warlock would team up with Doug, keeping his teammate safe. Though the two often worked together to confront enemies, Warlock's constant protection only served to lessen Doug's self- esteem. His shape-shifting abilities led him into a confrontation with the Impossible Man. This soon snowballed into an Earth-threatening incident as both entities tried to outdo each other. This only ended when Warlock showcased his ability to change color, something which the Impossible Man could not do.New Mutants Annual #3, 1987 Doug's death at the hands of the Ani- Mator devastated Warlock, leading him to go so far as to steal Doug's body. With the help of the rest of the New Mutants, he came to terms with Doug's death (and returned his friend's body to the rightful place).New Mutants #64 He continued to serve with the team, which led to a second trip to Asgard. Warlock and two new friends Boom Boom and Hrimhari became separated from the rest. They traveled to Asgard together. They were \\"rescued\\" from imprisonment by the children of Volstagg who sent them to talk with the mighty being Tiwaz. The trio eventually joined with a force to rescue the ruler of Asgard from an assassination attempt. During the crisis known as Inferno, Warlock's shape- shifting skills became vital in neutralizing the demonic threats. Warlock was kidnapped from the grounds of the X-Mansion, along with his friends Rictor, Boom Boom and Wolfsbane, and ended up on the island nation of Genosha which was ruled by Cameron Hodge. Warlock was killed in an attempt by Hodge to steal his powers.New Mutants #95 The news of his death was broadcast worldwide, a public relations disaster for Genosha since the world believed Warlock to be a \\"normal\\" human mutant. Wolfsbane asked Boom Boom to put Warlock's ashes on Doug's grave.New Mutants #97 Warlock had a distinctive way of talking during his stint in the New Mutants comics, frequently referring to himself with the personal pronoun \\"self\\". Though he initially refers to teammates with their first names or normal pronouns,New Mutants Annual #1 he later begins referring to them as \\"friends\\",New Mutants #26-27 and eventually as \\"selffriends\\". An exception is Danielle Moonstar who, likely due to leadership of the New Mutants, he calls \\"chiefriend\\".New Mutants #33-34 Doug, after offering his own life energy to keep Warlock alive during a mission in Asgard,X-Men Annual #9 earned the unique honorific title of \\"selfsoulfriend\\". =Douglock= Later, a group of humans called the Phalanx appeared. This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock's ashes. One of the Phalanx was Douglock, a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who had all of Doug's memories. This entity gained independence with the assistance of the robotic Zero.Excalibur #77 (May 1994) Douglock joined the European mutant superhero team Excalibur. At that time the team was based on Muir Island, which was owned and run by Moira MacTaggert. While his team-mates were unnerved by his similarity to Doug, Douglock was eventually accepted as his own person. He acted as a tutor to Meggan and enjoyed a brief romance with teammate Wolfsbane, foster daughter to Moira. This romance would cause him to react irrationally and dangerously at times, mainly destroying valuable scientific research because he did not understand it was more important than his budding relationship with Wolfsbane. In a bid to seize control of the UK, the covert intelligence operation, Black Air allied themselves with the London Branch of the Hellfire Club in order to raise an ancient demon from its crypt below London and use the ensuing chaos to their advantage. Black Air kidnapped Douglock to be used as the conduit to the crypt. However, after being lost in the time stream Captain Britain spent some time in an alternate timeline where Black Air was successful in its plans, leading to a dystopic future. Using this knowledge he and Excalibur were able to defuse the Hellfire Club, enter Black Air's HQ, rescue Douglock, and stop the demon's resurrection. Douglock would continue to mishandle other aspects of Earthly life. Despite his beliefs he could handle it, Douglock became inebriated during Captain Britain's bachelor party and passed out, and later experienced temporary memory problems as a result.Excalibur #124-125 (September‚ÄìOctober 1998) =Return as Warlock= It was later revealed that Douglock is actually a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug's memories. He then reverts to the name of Warlock and begins a career as a solo adventurer.Warlock #1, Oct 1999 During his adventures, Warlock is joined by a young girl, Hope, who can infect others with the techno-organic virus without being affected by it herself. Hope has a pet monkey that had been physically affected by the virus also. They are later joined by a novice psychic Psimon, whose group of allies combated techno- organic threats. Early in their adventures, they confront Spider-Man, team up with Shadowcat, cause trouble for Iron Man, and fight against the villain Psycho-Man.Warlock #1-#6, Oct 1999-Mar 2000 Warlock briefly fell under the control of the Red Skull when the Skull's desperate use of a Cosmic Cube took him somewhere safe where he could gain power over others, this wish taking him to Warlock's location, where he was able to force Warlock to help him take control of a SHIELD helicarrier and the agents on board. Fortunately, Nick Fury, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler and Colossus were able to infiltrate the helicarrier, and Warlock was able to use his connection to the ship to activate the currently-captive Machine Man. He attempted to stop the Skull by programming the also-captive Deathlok to kill him (unable to make Deathlok kill the Skull himself as that would go against his current programming), but Kitty delayed this long enough for Fury to destroy the Skull's control unit, although the Skull got away with a group of independently-programmed agents in a damaged HelicarrierX-Men Annual 1999. Warlock later heads back to his home on Muir Island where he becomes re-acquainted with his old flame Wolfsbane and her adoptive mother, Moira MacTaggert.Warlock #7, Apr 2000 An altered form of Bastion attacks the island. Hope, Psimon and Wolfsbane join Warlock's efforts to defeat this new threat. Later, all would travel to New York and assist the Avengers in defeating Warlock's father, the Magus.Warlock #8-#9, May‚ÄìJune 2000 =Nova= When Nova (Richard Rider) was searching for a cure for his Phalanx infection, he arrived on the Technarchy homeworld Kvch. Nova finds the only living beings are Warlock and his adopted charge, Tyro. Warlock gave Tyro his non-aggressive form of the transmode virus, and is raising Tyro in hopes that he can slowly but surely change Technarch society into a more benevolent and peaceful one. He also reveals that he cannot cure Nova, let alone stop the Phalanx infection, as doing so would kill him, and he cannot give up on the Technarchy. At that same time however, Gamora and Drax appear on the homeworld, and the Phalanx virus transforms them into a Babel Spire, which summons an adult Technarch Siredam. Warlock is forced to desperate measures: to ensure Tyro's safety, he sends him away, using all of his lifeglow to purge from Nova the transmode virus. Warlock's dying wish is for Nova to hold back the Siredam, coming to challenge Tyro, giving the youngling enough time to escape. However Tyro comes back, stricken by his surrogate father's sacrifice, and gambles his life in an attempt to \\"reprogram\\" the Siredam's body ‚Äî and all of its Lifeglow reserves. Now in possession of a Siredam's form and cosmic level abilities, Tyro is able to spare some of his inestimable Lifeglow reserves to resurrect Warlock. Warlock then agrees to help Nova in his battle against Ultron and the Phalanx, and as Tyro before, gambles that his mutant strain of the transmode virus could be able to disrupt the Phalanx strain, and purges Ultron out of Adam Warlock's body, allowing for his ultimate defeat. Along with Tyro and Wraith, he stays in the former Phalanx zones to heal infected people with Tyro's lifeglow and Wraith's exolons.Annihilation Conquest #6 =Return to Earth= Warlock returns to Earth where H.A.M.M.E.R. agents launch A.I. missiles at him. He takes control of the missiles and flies to his former home at the X-Mansion. There, he finds an old photo from his New Mutants days amongst the rubble. He then goes to Doug Ramsey's grave to find it has been dug up and his body missing.New Mutants vol. 3 #5 =Necrosha= Warlock discovers the New Mutants fighting a resurrected Doug Ramsey, who is under orders from Selene to destroy them. He intervenes and tries to speak to his self-soul-friend. Warlock detects malicious techno-organic malware present in Doug, and attempts to \\"defragment\\" Doug's software. During the process, he re-awakens some of Doug's memories from his days with the team before and up to his time of death. However, Warlock himself is infected by a Trojan-like virus and begins to lose control. Doug, still under Selene's influence, takes advantage of Warlock's vulnerability and decapitates Warlock.New Mutants vol. 3 #6 He then throws Warlock's severed head into the nearby ocean. There, small crustaceans are drawn to the head. Once they are in range, Warlock, still alive, absorbs their life energy, and is, after some time, able to escape his watery grave. Warlock returns to the battle only to find that resurrected members of once-deceased Hellions have arrived and have captured Doug Ramsey. The Hellions attempt to reprogram Doug by \\"deleting\\" the memories of his old self so that he may once again become Selene's obedient pawn. Warlock, along with the help of other New Mutant team members, rescues Doug and defeats the Hellions. =Second Coming= After the return of the mutant messiah, Hope Summers, and Cable to the mainstream timeline, Bastion and his members of the Human Council attacked her tirelessly. Cyclops ordered the New Mutants to attack one of Cameron Hodge's Right facilities, where Doug convinced Warlock to absorb Cameron Hodge and his soldiers' lifeglow to save his friends, and then to aid Cable and a group of X-Men from William Stryker and his Purifiers.X-Men: Legacy #235 The event of taking Hodge's life deeply scarred Warlock and after the event, he purged the lifeglow he harvested from Hodge's men and felt uncomfortable watching his team consume food, as the meaning for him had changed drastically. After the attack from Bastion, the team took a vacation and Illyana sensed that Pixie had been captured. Illyana sent Warlock to warn the X-Men. After surviving an attack in Limbo by demons and the Elder Gods, it was revealed that Illyana brought Legion back into the mainstream reality to use against the Elder Gods that General Ulysses and Project Purgatory were planning to unleash. Warlock was later asked, by Cyclops, to monitor police feeds around the world for crimes that were above the efforts of the local police, but under the radar of heroes such as the Avengers. Other versions =Exiles= The reality-hopping Exiles once visited a world where Doug Ramsey was infected by the Legacy Virus. Trying to save Ramsey's life, Warlock bonded with him, combining their life forces into one. Once the virus was introduced to Warlock's physiology, it mutates and becomes even more contagious. With over half the world infected by this new technological virus (called Vi-Locks), Doug Ramsey is kept in stasis. He is killed by one of the infected, once it discovers the Exiles are trying to create a cure based on Ramsey's original strain of the virus.Exiles #22 =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate X-Men \\"Magnetic North\\" storyline, Doug Ramsey appears. Whether or not this will lead into the Technarchy storyline is to be determined. In this continuity, Doug Ramsey is not a mutant; he is simply a staggeringly intelligent human being. Warlock makes a cameo appearance in one issue, where he is seen fighting the X-Men in a gigantic form. However, this serves primarily as an in-joke. In other media =Television= * Warlock (in his original incarnation) appeared in the X-Men animated series, voiced by David Corbain. This version's story was altered so that he actually came to Earth in an effort to escape his destiny of merging with the Phalanx. He and his Life-Mate (voiced by Susan Roman) crashed on Earth; he escaped the wreckage, his Life-Mate did not and gets captured by the villainous Cameron Hodge to recreate the Phalanx on Earth. A central character during the two-part \\"Phalanx Covenant\\" episode, he assists Beast and others to stop this techno-organic threat. After he volunteered himself to be assimilated with the cure and defeat the Phalanx infestation, Warlock's Life- Mate returns to normal and they both left Earth to return to their home world to influence the Phalanx for the better. =Film= Warlock was originally going to be appearing in the upcoming film New Mutants as a member of the team alongside with Magik, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Mirage and Sunspot but was removed from the final draft of the film's script. The film's co-writer and director Josh Boone revealed in an interview with Nerdist that Sacha Baron Cohen was in talks to played Warlock in voice and in MoCap. =Video Games= Warlock is a playable character in Marvel: Contest of Champions as of 22nd August 2019. =Toys= Warlock was featured as the Build-a-Figure in the spring 2017 X-Men wave of Marvel Legends action figures.http://marveltoynews.com/2017-marvel-legends-x-men-figures-official- packaged-photos/ References External links * UncannyXmen.net Spotlight on Warlock * Warlock at Marvel Wiki Category:Characters created by Bill Sienkiewicz Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984 Category:Marvel Comics aliens Category:Marvel Comics characters who are shapeshifters Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial superheroes Category:Marvel Comics male superheroes Category:Marvel Comics mutants ","title":"Warlock (New Mutants)"},{"id":"1164093","text":"Weberbauerella brongniartioides is a South American species of legume.

The suburb is named after Charles Cameron Kingston, the former Premier of South Australia and minister in the first Australian Commonwealth Government. It is adjacent to the suburbs of Barton, Fyshwick, Griffith and Manuka. The suburb of Kingston is situated about 4 km from the centre of Canberra.  History  Eastlake, 1928 Kingston industrial area 1950s In the early years of Canberra's development, Eastlake occupied the area now known as Kingston. Eastlake Football and Cricket club is one of the few reminders of Kingston long past. Eastlake was designated as a workers living quarters while the suburb of Forrest was reserved for middle and higher ranking public servants. About 120 portable wooden cottages for construction workers were built at the Causeway in 1925 and 1926. Canberra's first hall for community gatherings and entertainment was at the Causeway where the recreation hall was completed in 1926 with voluntary labour using materials provided by the Federal Capital Commission. After the second world war, housing at the Causeway and Westlake was considered sub-standard. Although all of the original Westlake cottage have been demolished, the Causeway survives with the original temporary wooden cottages now replaced with brick veneer cottages. As it was separated from the rest of the suburb by Wentworth Avenue and was situated to the north of the railway station the Causeway was a distinct district within the suburb of Kingston, however, it is now abutted by the new Kingston foreshore development.] The Causeway it is on the edge of a road called the Causeway, which was planned as a dam across the Molonglo River that would back up East Lake, which was planned by Walter Burley Griffin but never built. The cottages at Causeway were designed by HM Rolland and were first erected at Westlake in 1924, then Acton and finally at the Causeway in 1925‚Äì1926. The Westlake cottages were sold off from the mid-1950s ‚Äì last cottage removed in 1965. A number are now in Queanbeyan and down the South Coast. One also sits with a new coat of paint, in River Street, Oaks Estate. A photograph showing one of the cottages on the move is in Westlake One of the Vanished Suburbs of Canberra ‚Äì Gugler, A. The timber cottages at the Causeway were pulled down. The cottage design, referred to as portable timber cottages, designed by Rolland were based on the cottages erected at Westlake (present site, Block 3, Section 128 Stirling Park, Yarralumla) by Contractor John Howie for his married men ‚Äì built 1922. He also built nearby 18 or more timber huts for his single men, known as the Hostel Camp. The Burns Club was founded there in 1924. = Heritage listed areas = Former Transport Depot Canberra Baptist Church The following areas are heritage listed: * The Kingston/Griffith Garden City heritage precinct, sections 15, 16 and 17 of Kingston and section 22 of Griffith, bounded by Dawes, Howitt, Cunningham and Kennedy streets, Burke Crescent, Leichhardt and Cunningham streets and Canberra Avenue. The first stage of the precinct was constructed in 1926 and 1927 to accommodate lower rank public servants and workmen for the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. The listed area is the only part of the original East Lake precinct that has not been redeveloped. * The Kingston Powerhouse Historic Precinct. The powerhouse was built in 1915 and was the first permanent public building in Canberra. It was closed in 1929, but reactivated for periods between 1936 and 1942 and between 1948 and 1957. The Fitters‚Äô Workshop, the second permanent public building, is also in the precinct. The siren and whistle, which signalled times to Government outdoor workers in south Canberra for many years, is included in the listing. * Some Arizona and Himalayan cypresses near the original government printing works completed in 1927 east of Wentworth Avenue and north of Giles Street. * The former Transport Depot, Kingston, which was the centre of government transport operations in Canberra from 1927 to 1992 and is particularly notable for the steel fully welded rigid portal frame that was built to support its roof in 1940 and is considered to be one of the earliest examples of this technology in the world of its size. The building has housed The Old Bus Depot Markets since 14 February, 1998. * The Causeway Hall, which was built by voluntary labour in 1925 and served for some time as the city's principal place of entertainment, including as \\"a picture theatre, dance hall and the venue for other entertainment such as concerts and boxing matches\\". * The Canberra Baptist Church, 11 Currie Crescent, Kingston, constructed from 21 March 1928 and dedicated on 24 February 1929. It was the second permanent church built after the founding of Canberra and is considered by the ACT Heritage Council to be \\"a fine example of the Inter-War Gothic style and its internal and external integrity add to this significance.\\"  Current development  High rises flats in Kingston In recent years Kingston has been largely redeveloped with medium-density housing including townhouses and units. Most of Kingston south of Kingston Avenue is zoned for a predominant height of \\"3 storeys, with a maximum height of 4 storeys only where it is not the dominant feature of a street frontage\\", although there are two high-rise blocks north of the shopping centre and the detached houses in three city blocks in the south have heritage protection. The most recent development is the Kingston Foreshores development in which large numbers of high-value apartments are being built along the foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin. The area had previously been used for industrial purposes and is located between the Canberra railway station and the Kingston Powerhouse. These new developments and the rise of a caf√© society have reformed Kingston as one of the most exclusive suburbs in Canberra. The Kingston Foreshores are zoned for four-story units, but six-storey units are permitted under some conditions in some areas. Parts of the Kingston Group Centre are now zoned to be redeveloped to a height of 4 storeys (including next to Highgate Lane, which is currently a back alley) and 6 storeys (part of the parking area to the southeast and the site of the former Cusack furniture store).  Suburb amenities  Kingston contains the Kingston Shopping Centre, one of the earliest shopping areas built in Canberra. The northeastern corner of the shopping centre is built around a small park called Green Square. During recent drought years and water restrictions the exotic grass died and were replaced by native grasses that were more drought resistant, but more spiky, discouraging families with children. After a long campaign by local businesses, the exotic grass was reinstituted in early 2014. Kingston is also noted for a lively nightlife and bar scene. Other places of note in Kingston include the Kingston Powerhouse opened in 1915 and the Canberra railway station. The Old Bus Depot Markets, showing handcrafted goods and foodstuffs, are held on the lakeside every Sunday and have become a regular destination for locals and tourists. Kingston's streets are named after Australia's early European explorers. { Kingston Foreshore Kingston Foreshore Kingston Foreshore Howitt Street }  Demographics  At the , the population of Kingston was 4,424, including 41 (0.9%) Indigenous persons and 2,967 (67.2%) Australian-born persons. 3.5% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.9%), while 8.3% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.7%) and 88.3% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 13.1%). 46.7% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 22.2%.

Toponymy and history Oregon Country pioneers Reese and Sarah J. Anderson were Hazel Dell's first settlers. Sarah named the area after a stand of filberts on their land near what is today 78th Street and Highway 99. She also donated the land for the first school in Hazel Dell. The name \\"Bear Gulch\\" was briefly considered by the early Hazel Dell residents.Jollota, Pat. Naming Clark County. Vancouver: Fort Vancouver Historical Society Of Clark County, 1993. Print. Hazel Dell and Minnehaha were two of the first suburban areas to be developed after World War II and were followed by Lake Shore, Felida, and Salmon Creek. Much of the housing boom in this area has subsided due to the increase of homes being built to the east of Vancouver, between Interstate 205 and Camas and Washington State Route 500/Fourth Plain Boulevard and the Columbia River. Until the early 1970s, it was not uncommon to see horses and dairy cattle at several points along Interstate 5 and Highway 99 where there are now shopping centers. Children during that time often made money for school clothes and summer activities by picking strawberries, raspberries, beans and other vegetables at several farms in the area. After new child labor laws went into effect restricting children under 12 from working, most farm owners turned to \\"direct to customer\\" U-pick. There are now only a few small acreage farms left in Hazel Dell and no dairies at all. =Hazel Dell Parade of Bands= Every third Saturday in May since 1964, Hazel Dell has hosted the \\"Parade of Bands\\".

The American Indian and the Media, Minneapolis: National Conference of Christians and Jews, 1991: 34 His Dakota name was Mazuha Hokshina, or \\"Trader Boy.\\" Descended from hereditary chiefs, he belonged to the Yanktonai band of Dakota people. He attended the Pierre Indian School (a boarding school) in South Dakota in 1933. His artistic talent was recognized when he was young, and he studied in Dorothy Dunn‚Äôs art program at the Studio of Santa Fe Indian School from 1933 to 1938. In 1940 Howe was sent by the South Dakota Artists Project (a division of the Works Progress Administration in the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to Fort Sill Indian Art Center in Lawton, Oklahoma, to study mural painting techniques with Olle Nordmark. WPA artists were being commissioned to do murals in numerous federal buildings and sometimes local public buildings as well. After working for several years and serving in World War II, Howe went to college on the GI Bill, earning his B.A. degree at Dakota Wesleyan University in 1952. Having worked as an artist for more than a decade, he also taught as Artist- in-Residence. He received his M.F.A. at the University of Oklahoma in 1954. Howe met his future wife Heidi Hampel in Germany while serving overseas during World War II. He was discharged in 1945 and returned to the United States. After winning the Grand Purchase Prize in 1947 at the Indian Art Annual, sponsored by Philbrook Art Center, he had enough funds to send for Heidi to come to the United States and get married. In 1948 they had a daughter, Inge Dawn, their only child. Art career Howe's early paintings are similar to other work produced by the Santa Fe Indian School. Later he developed a distinctive style of his own. Howe began with traditional Sioux \\"straight line\\" painting, based on hide and later ledger paintings of the 19th century. It was \\"an artistic form which symbolizes truth or righteousness;\\" he infused it with the Native American art style Tohokmu (spider web), and his work has been compared to Cubism, though he rejected the neo-Cubist label in favor of situating his work firmly within Sioux epistemology. Through his art, he wanted to portray the contemporary realities of his tribal culture. During the 1930s and the Great Depression, Howe was employed by the Works Progress Administration in South Dakota. He painted a set of murals for the municipal auditorium in Mobridge and a mural within the dome of the old Carnegie Library, now the Carnegie Resource Center, in Mitchell, South Dakota. Howe worked as an art instructor at Pierre High School in 1939. From 1948 to 1971, he designed panels for the Corn Palace in Mitchell. Howe became Professor of Art at the University of South Dakota, in Vermillion, South Dakota, in 1957. He taught there until 1983. Survey texts and articles on Native American modern art often credit Howe with influencing the development of contemporary art in the Indian community. In 1958 he was rejected from a show of Native American art at the Philbrook Museum because his work did not meet the criteria of \\"traditional\\" Indian style. Howe wrote in protest, > \\"Are we to be held back forever with one phase of Indian painting that is > the most common way? Are we to be herded like a bunch of sheep, with no > right for individualism, dictated to as the Indian has always been, put on > reservations and treated like a child and only the White Man know what is > best for him... but one could easily turn to become a social protest > painter. I only hope the Art World will not be one more contributor to > holding us in chains.\\" His protest led to the acceptance of abstraction within the community. Over his 41-year career, Oscar Howe won numerous awards, including grand and first prizes. His works were displayed all over the world, including Paris, France and London, England, with more than 50 solo shows.

The knot group of a knot K is defined as the fundamental group of the knot complement of K in R3, :\\\\pi_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus K). Other conventions consider knots to be embedded in the 3-sphere, in which case the knot group is the fundamental group of its complement in S^3.  Properties  Two equivalent knots have isomorphic knot groups, so the knot group is a knot invariant and can be used to distinguish between certain pairs of inequivalent knots. This is because an equivalence between two knots is a self-homeomorphism of \\\\mathbb{R}^3 that is isotopic to the identity and sends the first knot onto the second. Such a homeomorphism restricts onto a homeomorphism of the complements of the knots, and this restricted homeomorphism induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups. However, it is possible for two inequivalent knots to have isomorphic knot groups (see below for an example). The abelianization of a knot group is always isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z; this follows because the abelianization agrees with the first homology group, which can be easily computed. The knot group (or fundamental group of an oriented link in general) can be computed in the Wirtinger presentation by a relatively simple algorithm. Examples *The unknot has knot group isomorphic to Z. *The trefoil knot has knot group isomorphic to the braid group B3.

She was an Australian Democrats member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2004, when she was defeated in a bid for re-election. Until Kelly Vincent's election to the South Australian Legislative Council in 2010, Dundas was the youngest woman ever elected to an Australian parliament. Dundas was born and raised in Canberra, and studied at Australian National University. While there, she became heavily involved in both student politics and community organisations, becoming the ACT Co-ordinator of the Young Women's Electoral Lobby in 1998. She served on the Management Committee of the Women's Centre for Health Matters, and on the General Committee of the ACT Council of Social Service. In 2000, Dundas became the National Secretary of the Young Australian Democrats movement, and National Convenor of the Democrat Students. In the same year, she was also secretary of the university student body, a member of the party executive in the ACT, and the founding co-convenor of the Vida Women's Network - an attempt to form a Democrat version of EMILY's List Australia. During the year, she also served on the Women's Committee of the National Union of Students. In September 2000 she unsuccessfully ran for President of the Australian National University Students' Association, as the leader of a combined Democrat/Liberal election ticket. Dundas worked as an organiser for the Community and Public Sector Union for several months in 2001, before gaining the top position on the Democrat ticket for the seat of Ginninderra in the ACT Legislative Assembly. She was subsequently elected, defeating conservative independent Dave Rugendyke. This made her the youngest woman elected to an Australian parliament, as well as the first Democrat to be elected in the ACT. Once elected to the Assembly, Dundas actively campaigned for increased government accountability, the environment, and women's rights. She supported a bill which liberalised the ACT's laws relating to abortion, and introduced a Private Member's Bill supporting the use of open source software. Roslyn Dundas stood in the left wing of the party, along with the likes of Senators Natasha Stott Despoja and Brian Greig. Over the next three years, she developed a significant public profile. She also preserved Jon Stanhope's Labor Party government by downgrading a no-confidence motion to a censure motion. However, in 2004 Dundas lost the seat to the Labor Party's Mary Porter. After leaving the Legislative Assembly, Dundas worked as the ACT director of Ausdance. In late 2007 she became an advisor to the ACT Children and Young People's Commissioner. She took up the position of director of the ACT Council of Social Service in 2008. Dundas became the CEO of Ausdance in January 2013.

Around the 1860s, the United States Federal Government created \\"day schools\\" to educate children about Western civilisation. They were ineffective in this process because the students did not retain the knowledge acquired at school. A factor in knowledge retention was the students returning home. After discovering this method of education was ineffective, a different approach was taken.Indian Boarding School. (2006, September 1). Retrieved February 13, 2015, from https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/boarding2.html In the 1870s, the concept of Indian Boarding Schools came into fruition. Army Lt. Richard Henry Pratt captured seventy-two Native American prisoners who fought against the Army; he tested his version of the social experiment that was previously attempted on the children. Pratt desired to mold the \\"savages\\" into \\"civilized\\" people.Official Report of the Nineteenth Annual Conference of Charities and Correction (1892), 46‚Äì59. Reprinted in Richard H. Pratt, \\"The Advantages of Mingling Indians with Whites,\\" Americanizing the American Indians: Writings by the \\"Friends of the Indian\\" 1880‚Äì1900(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973), 260‚Äì271. Pratt taught the Native American prisoners how to speak English and educated the Native Americans on European society and religion. After this educational experience, sixty-two of the Natives went to the Hampton Institute in Virginia. Deciding to extend the experiment further, Pratt was able to convince Native American families to allow their children to attend his boarding school. Richard H. Pratt founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879; the difference being, unlike day schools, Carlisle was located over a thousand miles away from the reservation. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the first boarding school specifically for Native Americans. The reasoning behind positioning the school a great distance from the reservations was that Pratt believed distance would help break the ties to Native American culture. He has been quoted as saying, \\"In Indian civilization I am a Baptist, because I believe in immersing the Indian in our civilization and when we get them under, holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked.\\". Pratt desired to remove the children from their Native roots, and he was harsh in the actions he took. Being that Pratt was from the Armed Forces, his background dictated how he operated the school. The students were forced to cut their hair, a symbol of their pride. One boarding school student was quoted as saying, \\"[Long hair] was the pride of all Indians. The boys, one by one, would break down and cry when they saw their braids thrown on the floor. All of the buckskin clothes had to go and we had to put on the clothes of the White Man\\".Hunt, Darek. \\" BIA's Impact on Indian Education Is an Education in Bad Education.\\" 30 Jan 2011.

The same student went on to say, \\"This is when the loneliness set in, for it was when we knew that we were all alone. Many boys ran away from the school because the treatment was so bad, but most of them were caught and brought back by the police\\".Hunt, Darek. \\"BIA's Impact on Indian Education Is an Education in Bad Education.\\" 30 Jan 2011.

In 2008, the SFIS razed eighteen buildings. Some preservationists were upset by the demolition. School officials stated: \\"After completing various assessments over the past five years, the Santa Fe Indian School exercised its sovereign authority and due diligence to take action by demolishing buildings to remove the imminent health, safety, and security threats to protect the students and staff of SFIS, including the general public\\".Willis, E.

After reviewing the different laws and regulations, the sovereignty overruled the Historic Preservation Acts; the Pueblo were able to demolish the historic buildings without retribution. The Pueblo stated the buildings being torn down contained asbestos. They did not have the funds to repair the buildings and maintain them. The demolition of these historic buildings, in turn, had many benefits for the Tribes. \\"A Pueblo governor reportedly called the demolition of the buildings \\"a spiritual cleansing\\" for his people\\". \\"Spiritual cleansing\\" was desired by the Pueblo Tribes after years of attending Indian Boarding Schools and assimilating to different ideals. The restoration of the school contributed to enhancing and reviving the overall cultural experience of the school. The rebuilding of the school was a collaborative design build project between Albuquerque offices of Flintco Construction and ASCG. To create a welcoming, home-like environment, SFIS included fireplaces in the dorms and classrooms. SFIS believes creating a familiar environment will prevent students from becoming homesick and possibly reduce the dropout rate.Wendel, K. R. (2004, September 1). School Design Reflects Students' Culture. School Design Reflects Students' Culture, 66, 3. Today there are 624 students enrolled at SFIS in grades 7-12. Out of 624 students, 155 commute and 469 live in the dorms. The school is currently 54% girls and 46% boys. The Nineteen Pueblo Tribes were the most influential in the construction of the school; they made sure the architecture reflected their traditions and contained elements of their typical architecture. \\"A crucial factor in the project's success was sighting the school buildings to replicate a pueblo village while preserving views with religious significance‚Ä¶ The buildings radiate out from a central plaza that is the focus of the site design\\". The design was constructed with the intention of facilitating student comfort. The project had nineteen owners, each a governor of one of the Nineteen Pueblo Tribes. These owners had conflicting views of the project goals increasing the project difficulty, but enhancing the project's outcome. Joseph Abeyta, the Director of the SFIS at the time, believed that these new renovations were their chance to take back ownership of the school and what it represents. They would ensure the school \\"would reflect and sustain their culture\\". These desires were fulfilled through the design of the project. The buildings were built in adobe style. The dorms and some classrooms contained fireplaces similar to the ones from their homes. SFIS has round rooms, to stimulate spirituality. These aspects tie together to produce the SFIS of today. With further construction and planning in the future, SFIS has a need to develop a reliable planning system. Education goals of SFIS The goals of SFIS are to educate the students by clarifying what they must accomplish, supported by an education of Native American culture as the foundation. \\"The Santa Fe Indian School remains a pivotal institution and educational training ground for the development of Indian students and their communities\\".New Mexico State Record Center and Archives. (2010). Santa Fe Indian School. New Mexico, United States. The strong relationship the school has with its tribal communities and parents is a fundamental aspect of the SFIS experience. With enhancing the educational experience and developing a new style of teaching, SFIS is looking to capitalize on the opportunities at hand and incorporate more technology into their plans. = Agriscience = One important initiative is a branch of CBE called Agriscience, which works closely with several Pueblo communities to engage students in all aspects of farming and agricultural practices through regular community visits.

Narrabundah is an established garden suburb, valued for its equal proximity to both Civic and the airport, Lake Burley Griffin, and vibrant local centres such as Manuka and Kingston. Residents particularly value Narrabundah's environment including its open spaces, parks, playgrounds, bushland landscapes, as well as its strong sense of community and diversity. The suburb's streetscapes are characterised by mature deciduous and native street trees, charming established gardens and largely single-storey detached homes. Street trees in Narrabundah offer colourful spring blossoms and spectacular Autumn foliage in many streets. Finniss Crescent, Carnegie Crescent, Sprent and Stuart Streets are planted with fine examples of Pin Oaks, which have rich green foliage in Summer and colour brilliantly in shades of scarlet and crimson in Autumn. History 'Narrabundah' is a Ngunnawal word meaning 'bird of prey', celebrated in the sculpture in the park opposite the Narrabundah shops. The name Narrabundah was taken from the parish of Narrabundah, a part of the cadastral division of Murray. This parish existed when the land was administered by New South Wales. After the Australian Capital Territory was established on 1 January 1911, all of the land areas were renamed. The present suburb Narrabundah was part of the original Parish of Queanbeyan. Narrabundah was gazetted as a division name on 20 September 1928. Narrabundah was the last of the ‚Äòinner south‚Äô suburbs to be developed, commencing in 1947, after being delayed by World War II. While early Canberra suburbs had mainly been built for public servants relocating from Melbourne, Narrabundah became Canberra's first blue collar suburb, housing mainly workers in construction and printing. While its first streets were initially named with numbers, street names in Narrabundah have since been renamed, with Indigenous culture, as well as white explorers and pioneers as the inspiration. Location Narrabundah is bordered by the residential suburb of Red Hill to the southwest, Griffith to the west and Kingston to the northwest, as well as the light industrial suburbs of Fyshwick to the east and Symonston to the southeast. The suburb can be divided into three distinct areas. The area to the east of Sturt and Jerrabomberra Avenues (sometimes called 'Old Narrabundah'), where the Narrabundah shops and other community facilities including the primary school, pre-school, churches and GP clinics are situated. This part is where Narrabundah's original fibro cottages were placed for European construction workers who came to Canberra in the 1950s to help develop the city, along with government printing workers from the British Isles who worked in Kingston and Fyshwick. Soon after, in the early to mid 1950s, full-brick duplexes and cottages were also built, many of which still stand. The second area, located between Captain Cook Crescent and Sturt Avenue, is near the Griffith shops, to the west of Sturt Avenue and south of Canberra Avenue. The remaining area (sometimes called 'upper Narrabundah' or 'Narrabundah Heights') is located to the west of Captain Cook Crescent and Jerrabomberra Avenue. It rises towards the west where it borders the suburb of Red Hill. From here, panoramic views of Civic and Black Mountain, Lake Burley Griffin, Mount Ainslie and other parts of south-eastern Canberra are possible from a number of vantage points. There are also good views to Red Hill and its ridge-line. This part of Narrabundah is closer to the Red Hill and Griffith shopping areas than to the rest of Narrabundah. Upper Narrabundah is known for its small population of urban peafowl (peacocks) with their colourful feathers. This area was once home to the residence of former Prime Minister John Gorton, who was often seen walking home from Parliament House via Manuka. Amenities Parks are widespread, with \\"Rocky Knoll\\" or \\"Rocky Knob\\" park in upper Narrabundah and its panoramic view over Canberra a favourite. The Narrabundah shops include Canberra's first op-shop http://www.vinnies.org.au/UserFiles/File/NATIONAL/Publications/Annual%20Report/SVDPNAR2007-web.pdf Vinnies (Society of Saint Vincent de Paul), restaurants (including XO and La Cantina), two daytime cafes (Mint Road and Dinner Rush at The Kitchen), the popular Narrabundah Takeaway (serving salad rolls, fish and chips and other quick snacks), as well as a real estate agent and property manager, pharmacy, Danny's (sourdough) Bakery - famous for its Hot Cross Buns, the Narrabundah Friendly Grocer, licensed post office at the newsagency, and two hairdressers. Narrabundah is home to the Canberra Cavalry baseball team, with home matches played at the Narrabundah Ballpark, informally known as the 'Bundahdome', near Mill Creek off Goyder Crescent in Old Narrabundah. Narrabundah is home to two primary schools, Narrabundah Early Childhood School and St. Benedict's Primary School. It is also home to Narrabundah College, one of the top public schools for the last two years of secondary schooling in the ACT and the first in Australia to offer the International Baccalaureate. For community matters, 'Old Narrabundah' is represented by the Old Narrabundah Community Council (ONCC), while most of the rest of the suburb is represented by the Griffith- Narrabundah Community Association. Both form part of the broader Inner South Community Council.

The banner is displayed in Lambing Flat, now known as Young. The Lambing Flat Riots (1860-1861) were a series of violent anti-Chinese demonstrations that took place in the Burrangong region, in New South Wales, Australia. They occurred on the goldfields at Spring Creek, Stoney Creek, Back Creek, Wombat, Blackguard Gully, Tipperary Gully, and Lambing Flat. Antipathy on the Goldfields Events in the Australian goldfields in the 1850s led to hostility toward Chinese miners on the part of many Europeans, which was to affect many aspects of European-Chinese relations in Australia for the next century. Some of the sources of conflict between European and Chinese miners arose from the nature of the industry they were engaged in. Most gold mining in the early years was alluvial mining, where the gold was in small particles mixed with dirt, gravel and clay close to the surface of the ground, or buried in the beds of old watercourses or \\"leads\\". Extracting the gold took no great skill, but it was hard work, and generally speaking, the more work, the more gold the miner won. Europeans tended to work alone or in small groups, concentrating on rich patches of ground, and frequently abandoning a reasonably rich claim to take up another one rumoured to be richer. Very few miners became wealthy; the reality of the diggings was that relatively few miners found even enough gold to earn them a living. The Chinese generally worked in large organised groups, covering the entire ground's surface, so that if there was any gold there, the Chinese miners usually found it. They lived communally and frugally, and could subsist on a much lower return than Europeans. The rural background of most of the Chinese diggers suited them very well to life as alluvial goldminers: they were used to long hours of hard outdoor work as a member of a disciplined team, accustomed to simple sleeping quarters and basic food, and were satisfied with a much smaller return of gold than the majority of Europeans. Tension between the two groups first surfaced as petty complaints: Europeans made stereotyped claims that the Chinese muddied the water holes, they worked on the Sabbath, they were thieves, they had insanitary habits, they accepted low wages and would drive down the value of labour. But because the Chinese were distinctive in appearance, language and dress, they became classic targets for xenophobia, and surly resentment became systematic hatred.Connolly, C.N., \\"Miners' Rights: explaining the 'Lambing Flat' riots of 1860-61\\" in Curthoys, A & Markus, A (eds) Who are our Enemies?: racism and the working class in Australia, Sydney, 1978 These pressures gave rise to several violent protests against government policies across Victoria and New South Wales in the late 1850s and early 1860s. The first anti-Chinese demonstration occurred in Bendigo in July 1854. Some of these incidents took the form of outright attempts at excluding the Chinese from a goldfield, or a portion of it. Disputes between European and Chinese miners flared into brawls at Daylesford and Castlemaine. A party of Chinese en route to the Victorian diggings from Robe discovered a new goldfield at Ararat, and were driven off their find by Europeans. Similar events occurred in New South Wales, which was just feeling the impact of significant Chinese immigration. European miners drove Chinese off the diggings at Rocky River in New England (Australia) in 1856. Serious confrontations followed at Adelong in 1857 and Tambaroora in 1858. In Victoria the Buckland River goldfield was the scene of repeated incidents, culminating in a major riot in July 1857. The Burrangong Affair The most notorious of these incidents, and the one which has generated more folklore than any other, was the so-called Lambing Flat Riot, actually a drawn-out series of incidents on the Burrangong Goldfield in New South Wales between November 1860 and September 1861. Several place names are sometimes used interchangeably when describing these events. Burrangong was the name of the gazetted goldfield, and its principal settlement later became the modern town of Young. Lambing Flat, the name which has attached itself most persistently to the events, was a horse paddock where one of the more violent incidents took place. Another important aspect of the story is the political events that were going on in Sydney, for the Burrangong affair was played out against the background of a contentious debate in the New South Wales Parliament over legislation to restrict Chinese immigration. Chinese numbers on the New South Wales goldfields had been relatively small, but were rising in the wake of restrictions imposed in Victoria. Restrictive legislation had also been proposed in New South Wales as early as 1858 in the wake of Victorian and South Australian laws, but the Premier, Charles Cowper, found his own party divided on the issue and the Bill failed. Then in 1860 the Chinese and British governments signed the Convention of Peking, a diplomatic agreement that subjects of the Chinese and British Empires would have reciprocal rights under their respective countries' laws. As the Australian colonies enacted British laws, it raised the question of whether New South Wales could legally exclude citizens of the Chinese Empire. A new Chinese Immigration Regulation Bill was being drafted for debate in Parliament while the first gold miners were arriving at Burrangong. The events at Burrangong were well-recorded at the time, and have been analysed by a number of historians in recent decades.Carrington, D.L., \\"Riots at Lambing Flat 1860-1861\\", Royal Australian Historical Society Journal 46,1960; Walker, R.B., \\"Another Look at the Lambing Flat Riots, 1860-1861\\", Royal Australian Historical Society Journal 56,1970; Seith, P., The Government, The Chinese and the Europeans at the Burrangong Goldfield, 1860-61, Research Essay, Australian National University, 1971 (National Library of Australia MS 2907); Seith, P., \\"The Burrangong (Lambing Flat) Riots 1860-61: a closer look\\", Royal Australian Historical Society Journal 60, 1974. The Burrangong affair was arguably the most serious civil disorder that has ever happened in Australia, involving more people and lasting much longer than the Eureka rebellion at Ballarat six years earlier. Trouble began late in 1860 with the formation of a Miners Protective League, followed by roll-ups (mass meetings) of European diggers evicting Chinese miners from sections of the field. These events involved the quasi-legal posting of notices to quit, and were carried out ceremonially, with a brass band leading the marchers. There was little violence at first. Most of the Chinese moved to new diggings nearby, and some returned soon afterward. This pattern of behaviour was to be repeated on several occasions over the next eight months; there seemed to be an understanding from early in the Burrangong events that the Chinese would be tolerated if they remained in certain areas of the goldfield. The Lambing Flat Riots In ten months of unrest at Burrangong, the most infamous riot on the gold fields occurred on the night of 30 June 1861 when a mob of between 2,000 and 3,000 European, North American and Australian-born gold miners attacked about 2,000 Chinese miners and drove the Chinese off the Lambing Flat, and then moved on to the Back Creek diggings, where 150 - 200 Chinese were encamped, they went about destroying tents and looting possessions.Coates, Ian, 'The Lambing Flat riots', in Stannage, T. et al (ed). Gold and Civilization, Sydney: Art Exhibitions Australia; Canberra: National Museum of Australia, 2001. Many of the Chinese were cruelly beaten, but no one was killed. About 1,000 Chinese abandoned the field and set up camp near Roberts' homestead at Currowang sheep station, 20 km away. There were two triggers for the violence: in Sydney the Legislative Council rejected the anti-Chinese bill, and a false rumour swept the goldfield that a new group of 1,500 Chinese were on the road to Burrangong. The police arrived in the days that followed, identified the leaders of the riot, and three were arrested two weeks later. The mob's reaction was an armed attack on the police camp by about a thousand miners on the night of 14 July, which the police broke up with gunfire and mounted sabre charges, leaving one rioter William Lupton,LAMBING FLAT. (1861, July 25). Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875), p. 4. Retrieved January 19, 2018, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60487537 dead and many wounded. The police briefly abandoned the field, but then a detachment of 280 soldiers, sailors and police reinforcements arrived from Sydney and stayed for a year. The Chinese were reinstated on the segregated diggings, the ringleaders of the riots were tried and two were gaoled. At the end of the affair, Burrangong was quiet and the Chinese were still there. A number of Chinese miners petitioned the NSW Government for compensation due to their losses in the riots. The Lambing Flat Banner A banner period, painted on a tent-flap in 1861, is now on display at the Lambing Flat museum in Young, New South Wales. Bearing a Southern Cross superimposed over a St. Andrew's Cross with the inscription, 'Roll Up - No Chinese', the banner has been claimed by some as a variant of the Eureka Flag. It served as an advertisement for a public meeting that presaged the infamous Lambing Flat riots later that year. Painted by a Scottish migrant, it is a testimony to the transfer of cultural practices and values through migration. Though it has been claimed to be an example of Chartist art, the Chartist movement was not racial in nature and sought only to protect the poor from the rich. Nevertheless, along with the Eureka Flag it is a rare example of an historic Australian banner designed to rally support to a cause. There are many conclusions as to who designed the flag. Some say it was three men's wives and others say it was a famous tailor.

Biography Blackburn was born in Inglewood, Victoria, to Maurice Blackburn, a bank manager, and his wife Thomasann Cole (n√©e McCrae), daughter of Captain Alexander McCrae. Following the death of his father in 1887, Blackburn and his mother moved to Melbourne where he was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, matriculating in 1896. He attended the University of Melbourne, graduating in arts and law in 1909, and began to practice as a lawyer a year later. In the same year, he also became a member of the Victorian Socialist Party and was soon editing its newspaper, The Socialist. Later, in about 1908, he joined the Australian Labor Party. Blackburn married Doris Amelia Hordern on 10 December 1914. Published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, (MUP), 1993 Later the same year he entered the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for the Electoral district of Essendon, but lost his seat in 1917, due largely to his strong anti-war and anti-conscription stances. He returned to practising law, establishing the firm Maurice Blackburn & Co. in 1919, dealing primarily in trade union law and civil liberties cases. During his time practising law, Blackburn won cases that played a key role in establishing rights most Australians now take for granted, including the 40-hour working week, wage equality for indigenous workers, and equal pay for women.http://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/about/about-maurice-blackburn- lawyers/ Blackburn made his mark on Australian politics in 1921 when he led a successful move to have the socialisation of the means of production added to Labor's official platform (which became known as the \\"socialist objective\\"). Returning to state Parliament as the member for Fitzroy in a 1925 by-election, Blackburn introduced legislation aimed at removing discrimination against women, and opposed what he saw as repressive economic measures proposed during the depression. In 1933, he was elected Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, but resigned from the Assembly in 1934 so he could contest the Federal seat of Bourke, based on the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg in Melbourne. Although he won Bourke and held it until 1943, his relationship with the Labor Party was chequered. In late 1934 and early 1935, Blackburn acted as legal counsel to prevent the deportation of the noted Czech anti- Fascist Egon Kisch. In October 1935, he voted in favour of sanctions against Italy over the Abyssinian crisis, defying his leader John Curtin. Blackburn's support for international socialism, and his opposition to conscription, frequently caused him to take positions opposed to Labor policy and, in October 1935, he was expelled over his membership of the Movement Against War and Fascism. He was soon re-admitted to the ALP, but expelled again in 1941 for his support of the Australia-Soviet Friendship League. His expulsion was seen as a warning to other left-wing MPs that violation of party policy was not to be tolerated. Blackburn continued to serve as the member for Bourke as an independent, voting against the Labor government's conscription bill, but he lost his seat at the 1943 election to the official Labor candidate. Blackburn died of cerebral tumour on 31 March 1944, Published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, (MUP), 1979. in Prahran, Victoria, and was buried in Box Hill Cemetery, survived by his wife, two sons, a daughter, and his mother. His estate, which included a fine library, was sworn for probate at ¬£2,552. In a eulogy, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin referred to Blackburn as \\"one of the great servants of the people of the Commonwealth of Australia\\". His widow, Doris, won Bourke as an Independent Labour candidate at the 1946 election and spent much of her time in Parliament promoting similar policies to those that Blackburn had supported.

The name 'hex' comes from 'hexadecimal': a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined to form the file. Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called sector editors or disk editors. Details Screenshot of a common hex editor (hexedit by Pascal Rigaux (Pixel)) With a hex editor, a user can see or edit the raw and exact contents of a file, as opposed to the interpretation of the same content that other, higher level application software may associate with the file format. For example, this could be raw image data, in contrast to the way image editing software would interpret and show the same file. Hex editors may be used to correct data corrupted by system or application program problems where it may not be worthwhile to write a special program to make the corrections. They are useful to bypass application edit checks which may prevent correction of erroneous data. They have been used to \\"patch\\" executable programs to change or add a few instructions as an alternative to recompilation. Program fixes for IBM mainframe systems are sometimes distributed as patches rather than distributing a complete copy of the affected program. In most hex editor applications, the data of the computer file is represented as hexadecimal values grouped in 4 groups of 4 bytes (or two groups of 8 bytes), followed by one group of 16 printable ASCII characters which correspond to each pair of hex values (each byte). Non-printable ASCII characters (e.g., Bell) and characters that would take more than one character space (e.g., tab) are typically represented by a dot (\\".\\") in the following ASCII field. Early history Since the invention of computers and their different uses, a variety of file formats has been created. In some special circumstances it was convenient to be able to access the data as a series of raw digits. A program called SUPERZAP (AMASPZAP) was available for IBM OS/360 systems which could edit raw disk records and also understood the format of executable files. Pairs of hexadecimal digits (each pair can represent a byte) are the current standard, because the vast majority of machines and file formats in use today handle data in units or groups of 8-bit bytes. Hexadecimal and also octal are common because these digits allow one to see which bits in a byte are set. Today, decimal instead of hexadecimal representation is becoming a popular second option due to the more familiar number base and additional helper tools, such as template systems and data inspectors, that reduce the benefits of the hexadecimal numerical format. Template systems An example of a simple template-based hex editor. Some hex editors offer a template system that can present the sequence of bytes of a binary file in a structured way, covering part or all of the desired file format. Usually the GUI for a template is a separate tool window next to the main hex editor. Some cheat engine systems consist only of such a template GUI. Typically, a template is represented as a list of labeled text boxes, such that individual values of a file can be easily edited in the appropriate format (e.g., as string, color, or decimal number). Without template support, it is necessary to find the right offset in a file where the value that is to be changed is stored. Also, raw hex editing may require conversion from hexadecimal to decimal, catering for byte order, or other data type conversion peculiarities. Templates can be stored as files, thereby exchanged by users, and are often shared publicly over the manufacturer's website. Most if not all hex editors define their own template file format; there is no trend to support a standard or even compatibility between the various formats out in the wild. Scripting systems Advanced hex editors have scripting systems that let the user create macro like functionality as a sequence of user interface commands for automating common tasks. This can be used for providing scripts that automatically patch files (e.g., game cheating, modding, or product fixes provided by community) or to write more complex/intelligent templates. Scripting languages vary widely, often being product specific languages resembling MS-DOS batch files, to systems that support fully-fledged scripting languages such as Lua or Python. Plugin systems A few select editors have a plugin system that allows to extend the GUI and add new functionality, usually loading dynamic link libraries written in a C-compatible language.

This area is best known as the center of the Caste War of Yucat√°n waged during the 19th century, that resulted in an independent Maya state governed from the city of Chan Santa Cruz. The site was first publicized by the archaeologist Herbert Spinden along with the New York Times journalist Gregory Mason during the 1920s, but intensive scrutiny did not begin until the 21st century. Recent archaeological work at Yo ºokop has revealed that it was a large and significant urban center before the Spanish Conquest. It was continuously inhabited from the Formative Period through the Postclassic Period, as revealed by the presence of datable ceramic sherds and architecture. The name of the site, Yo ºokop refers to a large shallow lake at the southern end of the settlement. (‚ÄúYo‚Äù is an article and ‚ÄúOkop‚Äù means lake. In older scholarship the site is referred to without the article as Okop.) The grandeur of Yo ºokop can be demonstrated by the fact that the site contains a pyramid (S4W1-1) overgrown with vegetation that is 28 meters tall‚Äîonly two meters shorter than the celebrated Castillo of Chichen Itza. The site is organized around four groups of architecture made from stone and other enduring materials. These groups are connected with raised roads (sacbeob). The areas between these larger groups contained houses made from perishable materials that are no longer easy to see. An archaeological project was instigated at Yo ºokop in 2000 under the directorship of Justine Shaw and Dave Johnstone. As of 2009 their team has studied Yo ºokop through mapping, ceramic analysis, and test pits. Their initial data shows how the site was organized, fitted within trade networks, and changed over time. Recognizing the significance of the area, in 2003 they expanded their project into a survey of the broader Cochuah region. One scholar affiliated with the project, Johan Normark, has done research that is notable for its use of theories about material culture and \\"agency\\". Linnea Wren and Travis Nygard have analyzed the monumental record of Yo ºokop in terms of both sacred and \\"gendered\\" space. Sculpture at the site includes two freestanding stelae of male rulers and a wall panel of a male ball player‚Äîall three of which are rendered in low- relief. The site also includes carefully carved hieroglyphic stair risers describing a queen (Kaloomte Na Cha ºak Kab) who may have ruled at Yo ºokop under the overlord Sky Witness from Calakmul or Dzoyola. The risers were not found in-situ. (For information on Sky Witness, see the work of Simon Martin and Nicolai Grube.) Prior to Shaw and Johnstone's project the site had been best-studied by Reginald Wilson, who published his findings during the 1970s. A brief visit to the site was also made during the 1950s by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Scholarship * Flores Colin, Alberto G., Dave Johnstone, Justine M.

People were not allowed to leave the country, with consequence of death penalty. Foreigners were in the same situation, anyone who attempted to enter Japan's territory would be killed by the soldiers right away. The entire country was dictated by Tokugawa government. The Sakoku policy was adopted by the ruler for preventing invaders, and keeping their national characteristics and national religion. This policy was banned after the Edo Period (1603‚Äì1868).

The organization works primarily in the areas of policy advocacy and media activism with the aim of advancing the equality of transgender people in the United States. Among other transgender-related issue areas, NCTE focuses on discrimination in employment, access to public accommodations, fair housing, identity documents, hate crimes and violence, criminal justice reform, federal research surveys and the Census, and health care access. History In 2002, then-co-chair of the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, Mara Keisling, moved to Washington, D.C., after recognizing the need for a professional activist presence in Washington for transgender people. With the support of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Keisling established the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2003. In the years since, NCTE has had numerous political victories. Early on, Keisling and NCTE led \\"United ENDA,\\" a coalition of over 400 LGBTQ rights organizations lobbying for a version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that had explicit protections for transgender individuals. Although the bill ultimately failed to pass, it was the first-ever transgender-inclusive legislation to be proposed to the U.S. Congress and yielded the first-ever Congressional hearing on transgender rights issues. Under the Obama administration, NCTE successfully lobbied for at least 150 federal policy changes on issues including health care access and non-discrimination in health services; federal employment protections; homeless and emergency shelter access; non- discrimination in federally-subsidized housing; and open military service for transgender service members. Also among these policy victories was the modification of State Department regulations, allowing transgender citizens to change the gender marker on their passport without necessarily having undergone genital reconstruction surgery. In late 2019, NCTE made national news when two thirds of the staff resigned in protest of the executive team. Following the resignations of employees, an unfair labor practice charge was filed by the Nonprofit Professional Employees Union against NCTE. The National Labor Relations Board issued a dismal letter for the complaint in April 2020. https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-252008 =Mission= NCTE's mission statement reads:  Prominent staff  = Mara Keisling = Mara Keisling is the founding executive director of NCTE. She is a trans woman and began transitioning in her early 40s. In addition to her work as executive director of NCTE, Keisling is a founding board member of the Stonewall Democracy Fund. She has also served as co-chair of the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, on the board of directors of LGBTQ youth group Common Roads, and on the steering committee of the Statewide Pennsylvania Rights Coalition. In recognition of her activism, Keisling has won awards from PFLAG; the Equality Forum; GayLaw; the Transgender Law Center; the Harvard Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance; and Out for Work, among others. Keisling was subject to controversy and was called to resign as Executive Director of NCTE in 2019. = Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen = Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen is the Deputy Executive Director for Policy and Action for NCTE. He is a transgender policy, advocacy and messaging expert. As a transgender man, his wide-ranging experience in the LGBTQ movement has covered field organizing, leadership development, fundraising, and media advocacy. He previously worked with Freedom for All Americans, GLAAD, the Transgender Law Center, Gender Justice LA, and the National LGBTQ Task Force. In past roles, he trained thousands of volunteers to canvass and phone bank on groundbreaking nondiscrimination and marriage equality campaigns, and organized leadership development programs in transgender communities and LGBTQ communities of color, honing new strategies for social change. Most recently, he co-led the successful campaign to update New Hampshire‚Äôs nondiscrimination protections to include transgender Granite Staters. Over the course of his career, he has conducted international Spanish-language interviews, including on Univision, Telemundo, and CNN en Espa√±ol, as well as English-language interviews with outlets such as The New York Times, MSNBC, CNN, and Politico. Rodrigo graduated from Brown University and lives in Washington, D.C. He serves of the Board of Directors of AsylumConnect, a non-profit connecting LGBTQ asylum seekers with resources in the US and Canada.https://transequality.org/about/people/rodrigo-heng- lehtinen-hehimhis Department of Labor = Raffi Freedman-Gurspan = Raffi Freedman-Gurspan is former director of external relations and former policy advisor at NCTE. Before joining NCTE as policy advisor in 2014, she served as legislative staffer for the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, LGBT liaison for the City of Somerville, and legislative director for Massachusetts State Representative Carl Sciortino, a Medford Democrat. On August 18, 2015, she was hired by President Barack Obama as Outreach and Recruitment Director in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, becoming the first openly transgender person to work as a White House staffer. He subsequently appointed her as the White House's primary LGBT liaison in 2016, making her the first openly transgender person in the role. On April 3, 2017, Freedman-Gurspan rejoined NCTE as director of external relations. In May 2019, Freedman-Gurspan left NCTE to become Deputy Campaign Director for the All on the Line Campaign, a project with a mission to end gerrymandering. Programs Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. NCTE works to educate policy makers and the American public about the transgender community and the issues facing it, as well as to lobby Congress and other policy makers to adopt policies that support the rights and human dignity of transgender Americans. In service of this mission, NCTE runs several programs spanning a variety of policy issue areas. =Policy issues= NCTE works on a variety of policy issues of significance to the transgender community. These include: state policy agendas; hate crimes and violence; employment non-discrimination; advocating for transgender parents and families of transgender people; health care access; access to homeless and emergency shelters; immigration reform; open military service; criminal justice reform; racial and economic justice; federal research surveys and the Census; travel security procedures and bodily privacy; voting rights; and protections for transgender students from bullying, discrimination, and accommodations exclusions. In addition to these policy programs, NCTE maintains an ID Documents Center and the Transgender Legal Services Network. The ID Documents Center offers a constantly updated database of federal, state, and territory-based policies regarding name and gender change procedures so that transgender individuals can more easily navigate these complex legal processes. The related Transgender Legal Services Network offers a consortium of over 60 organizations that offer advice, technical support, and legal resources to transgender individuals, many of which undertake pro bono projects. The Network also confers to improve one another's organizational capacities and expand their service provisions. =United ENDA= NCTE undertook successful work on state and local policies and in getting ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù added to federal hate crimes legislation (which passed in 2009 as the Mathew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act). But its primary initial policy goals were transforming the lesbian and gay rights movement into the LGBTQ rights movement and adding gender identity and expression language to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which was then pending before Congress and covered only ‚Äúsexual orientation.‚Äù A significant step toward making the lesbian and gay rights movement more inclusive occurred in 2007, when NCTE and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force led a coalition of more than 425 trans and LGBT groups known as United ENDA, which demanded that Congress not pass ENDA without gender identity protections. Even though no version of ENDA was enacted, the United ENDA campaign was a turning point in LGBTQ activism, leading to the solidification of an LGBTQ movement that was fully committed to trans rights. ENDA had been the legislative priority for lesbian and gay rights organizations since it was first introduced in 1993, but gender identity protections were not added until 2007. ENDA was replaced in 2015 with the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in not just employment, but also in public accommodations, education, housing, and credit. The Equality Act has yet to become law as of 2020. =ID Documents= NCTE is increasingly more involved in state advocacy as resources allowed, which included pushing states to make it easier for trans people to change their names and gender markers on identification documents (e.g., driver‚Äôs licenses and birth certificates) and to enact policies requiring health insurance companies and systems (such as Medicaid) to cover transition-related healthcare. NCTE maintains a comprehensive resources on its websitehttps://transequality.org/issues/identity-documents- privacy to assist trans people with navigating the complex state and local policies on ID document, as well as navigating health care systems to get them to provide transition-related care. =Won't Be Erased= During the Trump Administration, NCTE was a leader in resisting policy rollbacks from the federal government. In 2018, NCTE launched the ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Be Erased‚Äù campaign in response to a leaked White House memo that outlined a strategy to overturn protections for trans people. To document and raise awareness of the anti- trans actions of the Trump administration, NCTE has also catalogued each loss on its website in a project called ‚ÄúThe Discrimination Administration.‚Äùhttps://transequality.org/the-discrimination-administration =Transgender Lobby Day= On March 15, 2004, NCTE partnered with the now- defunct National Transgender Advocacy Coalition to run the first ever Transgender Lobby Day, for which transgender citizens and allies from across the country came to Washington to speak with their Senators and Representatives. Since then, NCTE has organized lobby days every few years consisting of a conference on transgender policy issues and meetings with members of Congress in which participants share their stories and talk about transgender issues. Past lobby days have featured guests from organizations such as the White House Office of Public Engagement, as well as prominent figures such as transgender activist and lawyer Shannon Minter from the National Center for Lesbian Rights, Masen Davis from the Transgender Law Center, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, and former Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Transgender lobby days frequently draw over 200 participants from nearly every state. =Reports=  National Transgender Discrimination Survey (2008)  In 2008, NCTE partnered with the National LGBTQ Task Force and Pennsylvania State University's Center for the Study of Higher Education to launch the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS). Then the largest study of transgender individuals in the United States, the NTDS surveyed 6,450 transgender residents about their experiences of discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, health care, and education, among others. The findings of the NTDS have since informed public policy in the United States, such as at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which based new housing regulations to protect LGBTQ people on the study.  U.S. Transgender Survey (2015)  In 2015, NCTE followed up the NDTS by launching the U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), thus far the largest study of transgender individuals in the United States. Nearly 28,000 transgender residents participated in the survey, which covered a broad range of topics pertaining to family life, health, housing, income, employment, discrimination, harassment and violence, military service, political participation, and others. In addition to the full national report, NCTE has released various breakout reports focusing on specific states. As of July 2017, breakout reports for 14 states have been released. = Media = NCTE is a frequent source of analysis and commentary for both American and international news media. In her capacity as executive director of NCTE, Keisling has appeared as a guest on news channels such as CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, and MSNBC. She is frequently quoted in newspapers, news magazines, and online news sources, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Time, Buzzfeed, and The Huffington Post. Keisling has also published op-eds in numerous outlets, including The New York Times, Time, NBC, CNN, and The Huffington Post. NCTE's former director of policy, Harper Jean Tobin, is similarly often quoted by news media including The New York Times, Reuters, PBS, and The Huffington Post, and has published op-eds in publications such as The Guardian. The organization also maintains its own blog on Medium.  Action Fund  In October 2017, NCTE launched an affiliated 501(c)(4) organization, the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. Because of its tax status, the Action Fund can endorse and oppose political candidates, which NCTE cannot do as a 501(c)(3) organization. At launch, the Action Fund endorsed three transgender candidates for public office: Phillipe Cunningham and Andrea Jenkins, who are running for seats on the Minneapolis City Council, and Danica Roem, who is running for the 13th District seat in Virginia's House of Delegates. In 2018, the NCTE Action Fund endorsed Brianna Titone for Colorado State Representative and Gerri Cannon for New Hampshire State Representative, who are the second and third sitting transgender state representatives (after Danica Roem became the first in Virginia in 2017). NCTE Action Fund also endorsed Alexandra Chandler for U.S. House of Representatives (MA-3), Christine Hallquist for Governor of Vermont, Kim Coco Iwamoto for Lieutenant Governor of Hawai‚Äôi, Amelia Marquez for Montana House of Representatives, and Melissa Sklarz for New York State Assembly. https://www.ncteactionfund.org/issues/endorsements/ In 2019, the NCTE Action Fund endorsed Danica Roem for the second time, for her successful re-election to the Virginia House of Delegates. https://www.ncteactionfund.org/issues/endorsements/ On May 5, 2020, the NCTE Action Fund made its first-ever Presidential endorsement: Joe Biden for President of the United States.https://www.ncteactionfund.org/press- releases/2020-presidential-candidates-take-part-in-historic-trans-rights- election-forum/ The organization also provides resources addressing the specific needs of transgender voters.  Controversy  In 2019, the majority of NCTE staff members resigned from the organization, citing concerns about workplace culture and the treatment of marginalized members of the trans community. Staff had previously called for the resignation of Executive Director Mara Keisling and Deputy Director Lisa Mottet in September 2019, but both executive leaders refused to resign. The National Labor Relations Board issued a dismal letter for the complaint in April 2020. https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-252008 See also * List of transgender- related topics * List of transgender-rights organizations * List of LGBT rights organizations References External links * * NCTE Blog * A Review of the National Center for Transgender Equality‚Äôs Decade of Accomplishment *Trans Equality's YouTube channel *Trans Equality's Action Fund channel Category:Transgender organizations in the United States Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2003 Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Bentley, 1854 Behaviour and ecology Female with young, at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between in elevation. They typically inhabit scrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and junipers (Juniperus macropoda). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season takes place in winter, during which the males fight each other by lunging, locking horns and attempting to push each other off balance. The gestation period lasts 135‚Äì170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, though rarely three. Markhor live in flocks, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% of the population and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19%, while subadults (males aged 2‚Äì3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12‚Äì24 months) make up 9% of the population. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above. =Predators= Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported to prey upon young markhor. Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Himalayan wolves (Canis lupus chanco) and brown bear (Ursus arctos) are the main predators of markhor. The markhor possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.  Taxonomy  Markhor in a Japanese zoo Bukharan markhor in captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo Aegoceros (Capra) Falconeri was the scientific name proposed by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1839 based on a female specimen from the Indian Himalayas. Multiple subspecies have been recognized often based on horn configuration alone but it has been shown that this can vary greatly even within the same population confined to one mountain range.Damm & Franco, CIC Caprinae Atlas of the World, CIC/Rowland Ward, 2014 * Astor markhor or Astore markhor (C. f. falconeri) * Bukharan markhor (C. f. heptneri) * Kabul markhor (C. f. megaceros) * Kashmir markhor (C. f. cashmiriensis) * Suleiman markhor (C. f. jerdoni) =Astor markhor= The Astor markhor has large, flat horns, branching out very widely, and then going up nearly straight with only a half turn. It is synonymous with Capra falconeri cashmiriensis or Pir Panjal markhor, which has heavy, flat horns, twisted like a corkscrew. Within Afghanistan, the Astor markhor is limited to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of Laghman and Nuristan. In India, this subspecies is restricted to a portion of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir. Throughout this range, Astor markhor populations are scattered, starting east of the Banihal Pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In Pakistan, the Astor markhor there is restricted to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot (Kohistan District) upstream to near the Tungas village (Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit up the Gilgit River, Chalt up the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley up the Astore River. It has been said to occur on the right side of the Yasin Valley (Gilgit District), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned markhor is also found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River. The largest population is currently found in Chitral National Park in Pakistan. =Bukharan markhor= Although the Bukharan markhor or Tajik markhurCastello J. R.

It is limited to the region between lower Pyanj and the Vakhsh Rivers near Kulyab in Tajikistan (about 70\\"E and 37‚Äô40‚Äô to 38\\"N), and in the Kugitangtau Range in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (around 66‚Äô40‚ÄôE and 37‚Äô30‚ÄôN). This subspecies may possibly exist in the Darwaz Peninsula of northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan. Before 1979, almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution in Afghanistan, and no new information has been developed in Afghanistan since that time. =Kabul markhor= The Kabul markhor has horns with a slight corkscrew, as well as a twist. A junior synonym is Capra falconeri jerdoni. Until 1978, the Kabul markhor survived in Afghanistan only in the Kabul Gorge and the Kohe Safi area of Kapissa, and in some isolated pockets in between. It now lives the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range in the mountains of Kapissa and Kabul Provinces, after having been driven from its original habitat due to intensive poaching. In Pakistan, its present range consists only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province and in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). The KPK Forest Department considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. At least 100 animals are thought to live on the Pakistani side of the Safed Koh range (Districts of Kurram and Khyber). =Relationship with the domestic goat= Certain authors have postulated that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of domestic goat. The Angora goat has been regarded by some as a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor.John Lord Hayes (1868). The Angora goat: its origin, culture and products. Boston, 1868Olive Schreiner (1898). Angora goat ... : and, A paper on the ostrich ... London : Longmans, 1898 Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with wild goats.The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication by Charles Darwin, Publisher O. Judd & company, 1868 Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have put forth the possibility of markhor being the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, due to their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship.''A natural history of domesticated mammals'' by Juliet Clutton-Brock, Publisher Cambridge University Press, 1999 .

Llandudno.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-10. Fecal samples taken from markhor and domestic goats indicate that there is a serious level of competition for food between the two species. The competition for food between herbivores is believed to have significantly reduced the standing crop of forage in the Himalaya-Karkoram-Hindukush ranges. Domestic livestock have an advantage over wild herbivores since the density of their herds often pushes their competitors out of the best grazing areas. Decreased forage availability has a negative effect on female fertility. Threats Hunting for meat as a means of subsistence or trade in wildlife parts adds to the growing problem for wildlife managers in many countries. Poaching, with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, is by far the most important factor threatening the survival of the markhor population. The most important types of poachers seem to be local inhabitants, state border guards, the latter usually relying on local hunting guides, and Afghans, illegally crossing the border. Poaching causes fragmentation of the population into small islands where the remaining subpopulations are prone to extinction. The markhor is a valued trophy hunting prize for its incredibly rare spiral horns which became a threat to their species. The continuing declines of markhor populations finally caught the international community and became a concern. =Hunting= Markhor In British India, markhor were considered to be among the most challenging game species, due to the danger involved in stalking and pursuing them in high, mountainous terrain.Hindu-Koh: Wanderings and Wild Sport on and Beyond the Himalayas (1853‚Äì1854) by Donald Macintyre, published by Asian Educational Services, 1996, According to Arthur Brinckman, in his The Rifle in Cashmere, \\"a man who is a good walker will never wish for any finer sport than ibex or markhoor shooting\\". Elliot Roosevelt wrote of how he shot two markhor in 1881, his first on 8 July, his second on 1 August. Although it is illegal to hunt markhor in Afghanistan, they have been traditionally hunted in Nuristan and Laghman Provinces, and this may have intensified during the War in Afghanistan. In Pakistan, hunting markhor is legal as part of a conservation process, expensive hunting licenses are available from the Pakistani government which allow for the hunting of old markhors which are no longer good for breeding purposes. In India, it is illegal to hunt markhor but they are poached for food and for their horns, which are thought to have medicinal properties. Markhor have also been successfully introduced to private game ranches in Texas. Unlike the aoudad, blackbuck, nilgai, ibex, and axis deer, however, markhor have not escaped in sufficient numbers to establish free-range wild populations in Texas. Conservation The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources currently classifies the markhor as a near threatened species, due to a relatively small population (2013 estimate: ~5,800 individuals), the absence of a projected total population decline, and relying on ongoing conservation efforts to keep this population level. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainability use the markhor species. This approach has been very effective compared to the protect lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir's Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978. Postal Stamp of Pakistan's National Animal,Markhor, in 2001 In culture The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan. It was one of the 72 animals featured on the World Wide Fund for Nature Conservation Coin Collection in 1976. Markhor marionettes are used in the Afghan puppet shows known as buz-baz. The markhor has also been mentioned in a Pakistani computer- animated film known as Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor.IMDB(2018)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7955106/ In 2018, Pakistan's flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines adopted the markhor on its new revised livery. The Markhor is also present on the logo of the Inter-Services Intelligence. =Etymology= The name is thought to be derived from Persian ‚Äî a conjunction of (, \\"snake, serpent\\") and the suffix (, \\"-eater\\"), interpreted to represent the animal's alleged ability to kill snakes, or as a reference to its corkscrew-like horns, which are somewhat reminiscent of coiling snakes. In folklore the markhor is known to kill, or literally, eat serpent. Thereafter, while chewing the cud, a foam-like substance comes out of its mouth which drops on the ground and dries. This foam-like substance is sought after by the local people, who believe it is useful in extracting the poison from snakebites. =Local names= *Balti: *Persian, Pashto, Urdu, Punjabi: *Hindi, Punjabi: *Ladaki: (male) and (female) *Burushaski: (Markhor), (male), (female) *Shina: , (male) and (female) *Brahui: (male) and (female) *Baluchi: (male) and (female) *Wakhi: (male) and (female) *Khowar/Chitrali: (male) and (female) References  External links  * Category:Capra (genus) Category:Fauna of the Himalayas Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Mammals of Pakistan Category:National symbols of Pakistan Category:Mammals described in 1839 ","title":"Markhor"},{"id":"1164228","text":"King Range is a mountain range, 22 km (14 mi) long and 8 km (5 mi) wide, in northwestern Victoria Land, Antarctica.

He then worked on telegraphy and undersea cables until engaged by the government of South Australia as astronomical and meteorological observer, and head of the electric telegraph department. Early life and career Todd was the son of grocer Griffith ToddH. P. Hollis, 'Todd, Sir Charles (1826‚Äì1910)', rev. K. T. Livingston, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 and Mary Parker;Source Citation: Place: Islington, London, Eng; Collection: Dr. William's Library; Nonconformist Registers; Date Range: 1815 ‚Äì 1832; Film Number: 815926 he was born at Islington, London, the third of five children. Shortly after Charles's birth the family moved to Greenwich, where his father set up as a wine and tea merchant. Charles was educated and spent most of his life in Greenwich before moving to Australia. In December 1841, he entered the service of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, under Sir George Biddell Airy. He was fortunate that his school leaving coincided with the Astronomer Royal being granted special funding to employ an additional four young men as computers to analyse, calibrate and publish a backlog of 80 years of data. While at the Royal Observatory he was one of the earliest observers of the planet Neptune in 1846. He was promoted to Assistant Astronomer at the Cambridge Observatory in November 1847,and officially confirmed in the position the following February. While here he used the recently built Northumberland telescope, and he was the first person to take daguerreotype photographs of the moon through it. While at Cambridge he also gained experience in using the telegraph. In May 1854, shortly before his appointment to South Australia, he was placed in charge of the newly formed Galvanic Department at Greenwich. This was to be an extension of work he had done using the electric telegraph at Cambridge. In February 1855, he accepted the position of Astronomical and Meteorological Observer, and Head of Electric Telegraph Department in South Australia. Meteorology was work done by astronomers; it was the recording of data so that the climate in different regions was known. The Royal Observatory was run by the Admiralty. Accurate calculation of time was an important part of the Royal Observatory's responsibilities. Greenwich Time had long been used at sea; ship's navigators relied on its accuracy to calculate their longitude. During Todd's time at the Greenwich and Cambridge observatories the railway system was expanding, and the electric telegraph was invented. Faster railway travel, and the need for timetables and signalling systems, necessitated a change from using solar time in different regions to a standardised railway or London time (later Greenwich Mean Time). The electric telegraph made it possible to transmit information, including time, at practically instantaneous speed. So the development of the electric telegraph was driven by the requirements of the railways. At about the time Charles Todd moved to Cambridge, George Airy arranged the connection of the Greenwich Observatory to the nearby telegraph line that was being built by the South Eastern Railway. This gave the observatories access to the electric telegraph, and the railway company access to accurate time. Once the electric telegraph was in place, the observatory was able to control clocks and time balls at any place there was telegraphic connection. It was also possible to perform a number of astronomical and other experiments. While at Cambridge, Charles Todd was a member of a team that determined the exact degrees of longitude at Greenwich and Cambridge using the electric telegraph. Todd's work as head of the Galvanic Department at Greenwich was to be an extension of his work using the electric telegraph. In particular, it was to transmit electric time signals to slave clocks and time balls, and to co- ordinate simultaneous astronomical or meteorological observations at multiple distant locations. Arrival in Adelaide Todd, along with his 19-year-old wife Alice Gillam BellThe Singing Line, Alice Thompson, Doubleday 1999, Written by his wife's Great Great Granddaughter who retraced his route across Australia in the 1990s (after whom Alice Springs is named), arrived in Adelaide on 5 November 1855. They were accompanied by Todd's assistant, 24-year-old Edward Cracknell and his wife. (Cracknell subsequently became superintendent of telegraphs in New South Wales). On his arrival Todd found that his department was a very small one without a single telegraph line. His first commission was to erect a telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Adelaide. Such a line had been mooted some years before, and impatient with the lack of action and seeing its commercial possibilities, James Macgeorge installed one privately, cleverly avoiding obstacles put in his way by the government, and had it operating in 1855. Todd's line, more direct and technically superior (and far more expensive) was opened in February 1856, and in June of that year he recommended that a line between Adelaide and Melbourne should be constructed. Todd personally rode over much of the country through which the line would have to pass. Todd and Samuel Walker McGowan, his counterpart in Victoria, proceeded to link the two colonies' telegraph systems near Mount Gambier in July 1858. Overland Telegraph Line In 1857 or 1859 Todd conceived the idea of the transcontinental telegraph line from Adelaide to Darwin. Most of the country in between except for the explorations of Charles Sturt and others was unknown, and it was many years before Todd could convince the South Australian government of the practicability of the scheme.Todd's proposal of routes and estimated costs of building segments of the telegraph line in Australia's far north held by State Records of South Australia GRG 154/5 Rough notes by Charles Todd outlining a plan for construction of the Overland Telegraph Line to Port DarwinOutgoing letter books and a notebook of Charles Todd as Post Master General and Superintendent of Telegraphs during the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line in 1872 are held by State Records of South Australia GRG 154/19, GRG 154/16, GRG 154/23, and GRG 154/15 In January 1863 Todd addressed the Adelaide Philosophical Society about the possibility of building telegraph routes that would link to an overseas cable. In 1868 the direct line between Adelaide and Sydney was completed and was used to determine the 141st meridian, the boundary line between South Australia and Victoria. Todd's calculations showed it to be 2¬º miles farther east than had previously been determined. This led to the long-drawn-out dispute between the two colonies. By 1870 it had been decided that the Australian Overland Telegraph Line should be constructed from Port Augusta in the south to Port Darwin in the north, though the other colonies declined to share in the cost. The southern and northern sections of the line were let by contract, and the 1000 miles in between was constructed by the department.A diary kept by Todd while he was Superintendent of Telegraphs and supervising the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line is held by State Records of South Australia, GRG 154/4 The contractor at the northern end threw up his contract and Todd had to go to the north himself and finish it. Everything had to be sent by sea and then carted, but he met each difficulty as it arose, and overcame it successfully. The line was completed on 22 August 1872, but the undersea cable to Darwin had broken and communication with England was not effected until 21 October. After the first messages had been exchanged over the new line, Todd was accompanied by surveyor Richard Randall Knuckey on the return journey from Central Mount Stuart to Adelaide, to be met by an enthusiastic crowd. His next great work was a line from Port Augusta, South Australia to Eucla in Western Australia ‚Äì a distance of ‚Äì in 1876, again surveyed by Knuckey. Postmaster General of South Australia In 1870 the Post Office and the Telegraph Department were amalgamated, and Charles Todd was appointed Postmaster General.Outgoing letter books from Charles Todd as South Australian Government Astronomer (Astronomical Observer), Superintendent of Telegraphs and, later, Post Master General, 1866 ‚Äì 1880, are held by State Records of South Australia, GRG 154/26 At this time Todd was busy with the construction of the Overland Telegraph. There were problems with the running of the Post Office culminating in two robberies. Consequently, in 1874 a Government Inquiry was held into the workings of the Post Office. The outcome of the inquiry was positive; Todd was able to implement reforms that improved both the working conditions of Post Office employees and the services provided by them. He was held in high esteem by his staff, and he continued to control his department with ability. When the colonies were federated in 1901 it was found that, in spite of its large area and sparse population, South Australia was the only one whose post and telegraphic department was carried on at a profit. Todd continued in office as deputy-postmaster-general until 1905. Meteorological work Charles Todd was one of the pioneers of meteorology in Australasia. As the Government Meteorological Observer for the Colony of South Australia, he worked with his counterparts in the other British colonies and established the Australia-New Zealand weather observation network. His work in meteorology started with his arrival in South Australia, as he had brought with him a number of meteorological instruments that had been calibrated to instruments at Greenwich. However, his main contribution to meteorology began with the completion of the Australian and New Zealand telegraph systems in the mid to late 1870s. Being at the centre of the network, Todd used weather observations from all the Colonies to create extensive synoptic charts. In the early 1880s Todd and his staff at the West Terrace Observatory in Adelaide were drawing inter-continental weather charts that had greater geographical reach than any other jurisdiction in the world. Todd's ability to pull together the individual threads of technology, weather science, and a widely dispersed group of weather observers put him in the forefront of the profession. His chief mentor in this field was James Glaisher, one of the founders of the science of meteorology. Todd is believed to be one of the first meteorologists to suggest that local climate was affected by global phenomena. Todd noted that abnormally high atmospheric pressure in India was matched with similar extremes in Australia, typically resulting in parallel droughts thousands of kilometres apart. This particular phenomenon is now recognised as part of the Southern Oscillation which in turn is part of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These globally linked meteorological phenomena are termed teleconnections and Todd was one of the first to recognise their effect. One of Todd's legacies is the 63-volume Weather Folio collection covering the period 1879‚Äì1909. These volumes have been digitally imaged by volunteers of the Australian Meteorological Society in conjunction with the South Australian Regional Office of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Atmospheric pressure data from these journals has been digitised and sent to the NOAA for inclusion in the International Surface Pressure Databank as part of the ACRE project. Government Electrician Charles Todd had many responsibilities, but during his lifetime he referred to himself as \\"Government Electrician\\". He promoted the use of electric light in the colony by giving demonstrations of the electric arc lamp, the first in 1860. In 1867 he demonstrated the arc lamp in King William St, lighting up from the Town Hall to North Terrace (about 500m). He was instrumental in having electric lighting installed at the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition, the first in Australia to do so. Also in 1887, the South Australian Electrical Society was established with Charles Todd as president. He was influential in setting up the first electrical engineering course in SA. Todd was appointed to a commission to add electric lighting to Parliament House in 1890; he supervised the installation the following year. Two years later the GPO finally had electric light. In 1899 Todd, with his son-in-law William Henry Bragg, demonstrated a wireless system that could be used over a distance of 4 km; but at this time was too expensive to be put into practice. Finally, Todd was responsible for drawing up the draft document which would regulate electricity supply in the newly federated Australian states. Astronomical work Though so much of his time was taken up by the duties of the postal department, Todd did not neglect his work as government astronomer. Using the Adelaide Observatory (completed in 1860), which was thoroughly equipped with astronomical and meteorological instruments, he contributed valuable observations to the scientific world on the transits of Venus in 1874 and 1882, the cloudy haze over Jupiter in 1876, the parallax of Mars in 1878, and on other occasions. He selected the site of the new observatory for Perth in 1895 and advised on the building and instruments to be obtained. He was the author of numerous papers on scientific subjects, many of which were printed in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Surveying As \\"Astronomical Observer\\" Todd was responsible for accurate setting of the position and the time at the colony, these were part of his initial tasks on his appointment. The precise position of the Adelaide Observatory was calculated by astronomical observations, enabling a standard point for geodetic surveys to be set. In 1882 the South Australian Institute of Surveyors was established with Charles Todd as its inaugural president. From 1886 until his retirement in 1905, Todd set and marked the astronomy paper that formed part of the exams for candidates aiming to become licensed surveyors. His best known work in surveying was his participation in setting the boundary line between South Australia and New South Wales that resulted in a call for a change in the existing boundary between South Australia and Victoria. This call led to a lengthy dispute between the two colonies which was finally settled in Victoria's favour. Other achievements The accurate determination of time was achieved by astronomical observations using a transit telescope. The Adelaide Post Office clock was installed in 1875 and it became a key timekeeper for Adelaide. In his official report to Parliament in 1862 Todd pressed the Government for a time ball to be installed near the port. An accurate signal would be sent by telegraph from the Adelaide Observatory to the port. Time balls were dropped daily at ports so that ship navigators could set their chronometers accurately, a small inaccuracy in a chronometer resulted in large inaccuracies in navigation. Todd and the Harbour Master made repeated requests for a time ball in the following years. Port Adelaide was visited by more ships after the completion of the Overland Telegraph, and approval by Parliament was eventually given in 1874 to build the time ball at Semaphore. It was completed in 1875, and is believed to have been designed by Todd and manufactured locally. Later career In 1885 he attended the international telegraphic conference at Berlin, the following year Todd travelled to Great Britain, where he was made an honorary M.A. of the University of Cambridge. In 1889 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. He was also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Meteorological Society and of the Society of Electrical Engineers. Todd continued in his duties to posts and telegraphs in South Australia, until the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia took over all such services on 1 March 1901 and Todd became a federal public servant at the age of 74. He retired in December 1906, having been over 51 years in the service of the South Australian and Commonwealth governments. Death and legacy Todd died at his summer home, Semaphore, near Adelaide, on 29 January 1910, and was buried at North Road Cemetery, Adelaide, on 31 January. The Sir Charles Todd Building at the University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes Campus is named after him. The Astronomical Society of South Australia have also named the observatory that houses their 20-inch Jubilee Telescope, the Sir Charles Todd Observatory. Each year the Telecommunications Society of Australia invites a prominent member of the telecommunications industry to present the Charles Todd Oration and awards a medal to the industry high achiever best embodying the pioneer spirit. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Institute of Engineers Australia.

The magazine featured content on various video game consoles, PC computers and mobile devices. GamePro Media properties included GamePro magazine and their website. The company was also a part subsidiary of the privately held International Data Group (IDG), a media, events and research technology group. Originally published in 1989, GamePro magazine provided feature articles, news, previews and reviews on various video games, video game hardware and the entertainment video game industry. The magazine was published monthly (most recently from its headquarters in Oakland, California) with October 2011 being its last issue, after over 22 years of publication. GamePro's February 2010 issue introduced a redesigned layout and a new editorial direction focused on the people and culture of its gaming. GamePro.com was officially launched in 1998. Updated daily, the website's content included feature articles, news, previews, reviews, screenshots and videos covering video games, video game hardware and the entertainment gaming industry. The website also included user content such as forums, reviews and blogs. In January 2010, the website was redesigned to reflect the same new editorial changes being made in the print magazine. The website was based at Gamepro's headquarters in San Francisco from 1998 to 2002 and then in Oakland, California from 2002 to 2011. Gamepro.com also had international variants that have now outlasted their parent publication in countries such as Germany, and France.  History and establishment  Gamepro was first established in late 1988 by Patrick Ferrell, his sister-in-law Leeanne McDermott, and the husband-wife design team of Michael and Lynne Kavish. They worked out of their houses throughout the San Francisco Bay Area before leasing their first office in Redwood City, California at the end of 1989. Lacking the cashflow to be able to sustain growth after publishing the first issue, the founding management team sought a major publisher and in 1989 found one with IDG Peterborough, a New Hampshire-based division of the global giant IDG. Led by a merger and acquisition team comprising IDG Peterborough President Roger Murphy and two other IDG executives, Jim McBrian and Roger Strukhoff, the magazine was acquired, then a few months later spun off as an independent business unit of IDG, under the leadership of Ferrell as president/CEO. The later addition of John Rousseau as publisher and editor-in- chief Wes Nihei, as well as renowned artist Francis Mao, established Gamepro as a large, profitable magazine worldwide publication. Francis Mao, acting in his role as art director for the nascent GamePro, contracted game illustrator Marc Ericksen to create the premiere cover for the first addition of the magazine. Ericksen would go on to produce five of the first ten covers for GamePro, eventually creating eight in total, and would continue a secondary role creating a number of the double page spreads for the very popular monthly Pro Tips section. Over the years, the Gamepro offices have moved from Redwood City (1989‚Äì1991) to San Mateo (1991-1998) to San Francisco (1998-2002) and lastly Oakland. In 1993, the company was renamed from Gamepro Inc. to Infotainment World in reflection of its growing and diverse publication lines. The magazine was known for its editors using comic book-like avatars and monikers when reviewing games. As of January 2004, however, Gamepro ceased to use the avatars due to a change in the overall design and layout of the magazine. Meanwhile, editorial voices carried over to the community on its online sister publication, www.gamepro.com. Gamepro was also most widely famous for its ProTips, small pieces of gameplay tips and advice depicted with game screenshot captions. It also features a special corner section known as Code Vault (formerly C.S.A.T. Pro), where secret codes are all posted. These particular features have since gradually vanished. Code Vault was also published in print format and sold as a quarterly cheats and strategy magazine on newsstands. There was also a TV show called GamePro TV. The show was hosted by J. D. Roth and Brennan Howard. The show was nationally syndicated for one year, then moved to cable (USA and Sci-Fi) for a second year. In 1993, Patrick Ferrell sent Debra Vernon, VP of marketing, to a meeting between the games industry and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Realizing an opportunity, the team at the now-entitled Infotainment World launched E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The industry backed E3 and Ferrell partnered with the IDSA to produce the event. It was one of the biggest trade show launches in history. Early in its lifespan, the magazine also included comic book pages about the adventures of a superhero named Gamepro who was a video game player from the real world brought into a dimension where video games were real to save it from creatures called the Evil Darklings. In 2003, Joyride Studios produced limited-edition action figures of some of the Gamepro editorial characters. Gamepro also appeared in several international editions, including France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Brazil and Greece. Some of these publications share the North American content, while some others share only the name and logo but do feature different content. Early in 2006, IDG Entertainment began to change internally and shift operational focus from a \\"Print to Online\\" to \\"Online to Print\\" publishing mentality. The first steps; build a large online network of web sites and rebuild the editorial team. Enter: George Jones, industry veteran. In February 2006, Gamepro's online video channel, Games.net, launched a series of video-game related shows. The extensive online programming is geared towards an older and more mature audience. In August 2006, the Gamepro online team spun off a new cheats site, GamerHelp.com. It was shortly followed by a video game information aggregation site, Games.net, and a dedicated gaming downloads site, GameDownloads.com. Under the new leadership of George Jones, Gamepro magazine underwent a massive overhaul in the March 2007 issue. While losing some of the more dated elements of the magazine, the new arrangement focused on five main insertions: HD game images, more reviews and previews per issue, www.gamepro.com community showcase, user contributions and insider news. However the German Gamepro website is still run, however this time, by \\"GameStar\\" as their partner, as that website have a message at the top of the screen saying \\"Partner of GameStar\\" (Note: This is written in German) In 2009, Gamepro's 20th anniversary coincided with 20-year industry veteran John Davison joining the newly named Gamepro Media team in October 2009 as executive vice president of content. Under Davison's direction, the magazine and website were redesigned in early 2010 with an editorial shift toward focusing on the people and culture of gaming. The redesigned magazine and website were met with an enthusiastic audience response. In addition to announcing the hire of Davison in October 2009, the company also announced an \\"aggressive growth plan throughout 2009 and beyond, with numerous online media initiatives to deepen consumer engagement and create new opportunities for advertisers.\\" Plans included partnering with sister company IDG TechNetwork to build a \\"boutique online network of sites.\\" The result was the introduction of the Gamepro Media Network. In September 2010, Gamepro Media announced a new alliance with online magazine The Escapist offering marketers joint advertising programs for reaching an unduplicated male audience. The partnership was named the Gamepro Escapist Media Group. In November 2010, Julian Rignall joined Gamepro Media as its new vice-president of content, replacing John Davison, who resigned in September 2010. Gamepro ended monthly publication after over 22 years with its October 2011 issue. Shortly after that issue, the magazine changed to Gamepro Quarterly, which was a quarterly publication using higher quality paper stock as well as being larger and thicker than all of the previous standard magazine issues. Gamepro Quarterly hit newsstands within the first half of November 2011.Editor's Letter, Gamepro Issue #267 (erroneously labeled 277 on the cover) October 2011 The quarterly endeavor lasted for only one issue before being scrapped. On November 30, it was announced that Gamepro as a magazine and a website would be shutting down on December 5, 2011. Gamepro then became part of the PC World website as a small section of the site covering the latest video games, run by the PC World staff. Content = Main sections = In February 2010, the magazine's main sections were:- * Inside: A redesigned table of contents page listing the major pieces and games in the issue. * From the Editor: A column found at the beginning of the magazine from the editor introducing features or big games covered in that month's issue. * Inbox: User feedback and letter of the month. ** Art Attack: Reader art sent into the magazine. That month's best art would win a game-related prize. * Editorials: Articles on varying topics by freelance writers and individuals working in the game industry. * Spawn Point: Front of magazine sections featuring behind-the-scenes game news and insights, interviews, game previews and a calendar of \\"gamer-culture events\\". * The Bonus Level: A short guide to \\"essential geek gear\\", including video game releases, books and game-related items for sale at various websites. * Features: Any cover stories or featured games/issues that warrant a separate article would be told here. * Reviews: This section was initially named \\"ProViews\\" and later renamed to \\"ProReviews\\". The reviews format changed over the years, although the original basic format remained the same: One reviewer speaks for the entire Gamepro staff about a particular game. The magazine initially began by giving each platform its own section of reviews. Near the end of 2005, Gamepro changed this format to have only one review for any game released on more than one platform, describing any differences that one platform may have over another with that particular game, and giving separate scores for each platform's version of the game. During 2006, another aspect of the reviews debuted, called \\"Key Moment\\", in which the reviewer names one particular instance or a standout piece of the game that led them to the decision they made in a short, one sentence description. \\"Key Moment\\" was eventually replaced by \\"Pros\\" and \\"Cons\\", found with the review score, which briefly list any issues that stand out with the game, both good and bad. * Parting Shot: With the major overhaul of the magazine in the February 2010 issue, Opening Shots was dropped, and Parting Shot went from being art from a particular game showcased at the back of the magazine, to a look back at the issue of Gamepro that appeared that month 10 years ago. = Retired sections = * Opening Shots/Parting Shot: Use of higher quality HD images and bigger, more detailed screen shots throughout the magazine. \\"Opening Shots\\" is a new screen grab gallery at the front of the magazine, while \\"Parting Shot\\" is art from a game showcased at the back of the magazine. * The Hub: Section dedicated to the Gamepro.com online community. Back of the magazine highlights of reader reviews, comments, new \\"Ask the Pros\\" question of the month, community leaders profile highlights, featured forum threads and the new Head2Head: User feedback and letter of the month. Every week, the Hub gets a new Featured Member. ** Ask The Pros: Returns from the past in this new, online version of user submitted question (online) and answered by the editor of relative expertise. ** Head2Head: User feedback and letter of the month return to new subsection in rear of each issue. * Previews (formerly known as \\"Short ProShots\\" and then \\"Sneak Previews\\"): A peek at games in development, telling of the projected release dates of games and what to expect out of them. When this column first appeared, it was in the back of the magazine, with only minuscule information. In 1996, it was moved to the front of the magazine after the features. It was shortly after the rearranging in 1996 that GamePro started a new approach to the previews, labeling previews as either \\"First Look\\", where they may have only seen a video and only had information on storyline and features in the game, and \\"Hands-On\\", where the editor providing the preview got to play an early build of the game and described any first impressions of the game. Also added for a short time in 1996 was a \\"percent complete bar\\" graphic that noted how far along the game was. This graphic was dropped in 1999 during the 10th Anniversary redesign. * Games To Go: Reviews and previews of games for portable game systems. * The Sports Page: Previews and reviews of sports games. When this section debuted in 1993, each review and preview got its own \\"headline\\" to give the section a newspaper feel. By the end of 1996, the newspaper-style headlines were only used for one or two reviews each issue and never for previews, and they were dropped entirely in 1999 for the 10th Anniversary redesign. This section was also the first section to have the \\"multiplatform game review\\" tactic described above, in 2003. * Role Players Realm: Reviews, previews, and walkthroughs of role playing games (RPGs). Often a walkthrough for a game would be serialized across two or three issues. During slow months for RPGs, the section would be padded with fantasy-themed video games from other genres. * Code Vault (formerly \\"C.S.A.T. Pro\\"): Video game cheats, strategies, tactics, tips, secrets and easter eggs revealed. Both game companies and readers sent in submissions for this section, with a random prize to the reader who sent in the best tip (usually a game). When this section debuted as C.S.A.T. Pro, C.S.A.T. stood for \\"Cheats, Strategies and Tactics\\". In 2002 this feature was renamed \\"Code Vault\\" so as to match the name of Gamepros short-lived cheat- code spinoff magazines. * Head-2-Head (formerly known as \\"The Mail\\"): A letters to the editor section. They began doing a \\"Letter Of The Month\\" special in 2004, with the winning letter's author winning a particular prize. This section had begun to feature a Reader Review from their website on a particular game as a way to entice other readers to visit their site and do the same. Throughout the magazine's lifespan, this section was in the front of the magazine. However, as of April 2007's redesign, the section has been moved to the back of the magazine. * Buyers Beware: A consumer advocacy section in which readers send in complaints about issues with defective and malfunctioning games, peripherals, systems, and the like. Gamepro was the only publication to feature such a column. Every once in a while, the column steered away from its usual formula to feature a current widespread issue. Often, a representative of a game company directly answers a query in the section (although sometimes the editor may put his own reaction to the answer). This was the only Gamepro column to be authored by the same editor since its debut in 1994: The Watch Dog. This section migrated onto Gamepro.com as of the April 2007 redesign, and was seemingly dropped from the print magazine. * ProNews: Gamepros news section. This section first appeared in the back of the magazine after the reviews, but found its way to the front of the magazine in 1996 to follow suit with other game magazines. This section has shape-shifted over the years to include various \\"game watches\\", a random quote generation sidebar called \\"Static\\" that seemingly disappeared after 2003. Gamepro Labs, which used to be a separate column, then appeared as a part of this section. * Hot At The Arcades: Previews and reviews of cabinet arcade games. This section appeared regularly for about 5 years after the magazine debuted. The section still appeared every now and again, but was absent for the most part since 1997 due to the steady decline of arcades. This section was at times folded into the Pro news section. * Overseas Prospects: Import games were featured and sometimes reviewed. This section is still in the magazine, but appears only rarely. * Video Game Survival Guide: Originally titled \\"16-Bit Survival Guide\\" when the Super NES and Genesis were on the last year of their respective runs, to review those games that were still being released for the systems. This was changed to reflect other game systems that were close to, or even past, the end of their commercial lifespan. * Adventures of Gamepro: The Adventures of Gamepro was a comic strip run in the early issues of the magazine detailing the adventures of a superhero named after the magazine. He was a gamer drawn into the realm of video games to fight off evil creatures taking over game after game called the Evil Darklings. =Rating scale= At first, games were rated by five categories: Graphics, Sound, Gameplay, FunFactor, and Challenge. Later the \\"Challenge\\" category was dropped and the \\"Gameplay\\" category was renamed \\"Control\\". The ratings were initially on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, in increments of 0.5, but a possible 0.5 score was later added. The first game to receive such a score was Battle Arena Toshinden URA for the Sega Saturn. Starting in October 1990, each score was accentuated with a cartoon face (The Gamepro Dude) depicting different expressions for different ratings. The ratings faces remained in use until about 2000. GamePros reviews became esteemed enough that some games would display their GamePro ratings on their retail boxes. After 2000, the category system was eliminated in favor of a single overall rating for each game on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0 stars. A graphic of five stars were shown alongside the written review. The number of stars a game earned was indicated by the number of solid stars (e.g., a game's 4-star rating was represented by showing 4 solid stars and one hollow star). No game ever received less than one star. An Editors' Choice Award was given to a game that earned either 4.5 or 5.0 stars. =Role-Player's Realm= GamePro had a \\"Role-Player's Realm\\" section dedicated to the coverage and reviews of role-playing video games. In the January 1997 issue, they published a list of \\"The Top Ten Best RPGs Ever\\" which consisted of the following games:\\"Role-Players Realm\\", GamePro, issue 110 (January 1997), page 144 #The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (Super NES) #Final Fantasy 3 (Super NES) #Lunar: Eternal Blue / Silver Star (Sega CD) #Breath of Fire II (Super NES) #Phantasy Star IV (Genesis) #Secret of Mana (Super NES) #Chrono Trigger (Super NES) #Super Mario RPG (Super NES) #Might and Magic II (Genesis) #Final Fantasy 2 (Super NES) Later in 2008, GamePro published another list of \\"The 26 Best RPGs of the All Time\\", the top ten of which consisted of the following games: #Final Fantasy VII #World of Warcraft #The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time #Chrono Trigger #Fallout 3 #Diablo II: Lord of Destruction #Ultima series #Xenogears #The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past #Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic =ProTips= GamePro is credited with coming up with the concept of \\"Protip\\", a short piece of advice as if spoken by an expert usually attached to an image, which was explained by former writer Dan Amrich that as part of their editorial process, they were encouraged to caption the three-to-seven images used in an article with such advice. One purported image from a GamePro review of Doom (1993) had a caption for an image of the game's final boss as \\"PROTIP: To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies\\". The apparent advice, which is common sense and self-evident for players of first-person shooters like Doom, was widely mocked and created a meme of similarly obvious protips added as captions to pictures. However, the image was revealed to be a fake, created as an April's Fool joke for a fansite doomworld.com. =Lamepro= Every April until 2007, as an April Fools' Day prank, Gamepro printed a 2-5 page satirical spoof of the magazine called Lamepro, a parody of Gamepro's own official title. The feature contained humorous game titles and fake news similar to The Onion, though some content, such as ways to get useless game glitches (games getting stuck, reset, or otherwise), was real. The section parodied GamePro itself, as well as other game magazines. PC Games What was called a \\"sister publication\\" to GamePro, PC Games, was published by IDG until 1999. It was founded in August 1988, but changed its name to Electronic Entertainment in late 1993 and PC Entertainment in early 1996. The title reverted to PC Games in June 1996. Its PC Games Online website was merged with several other IDG properties, including GamePro Online, to form the IDG Games Network in late 1997. The print version of PC Games was the fourth-largest computer game magazine in the United States during 1998, with a circulation of 169,281. In March 1999, it was purchased and closed by Imagine Publishing; its April 1999 issue was its last. Following this event, Imagine sent former subscribers of PC Games issues of PC Gamer US and PC Accelerator in its place. According to GameDaily, the move came as part of IDG's rebranding effort to lean more heavily on the GamePro name: coverage of computer games was thereafter centralized at PCGamePro.com, and in the \\"PC GamePro\\" section of GamePros print edition.

DLNA certified devices include smartphones, tablets, PCs, TV sets and storage servers. The group published its first set of guidelines in June 2004. The guidelines incorporate several existing public standards, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) for media management and device discovery and control, and widely used digital media formats and wired and wireless networking standards. DLNA works with cable, satellite, and telecom service providers to provide link protection on each end of the data transfer. The extra layer of digital rights management (DRM) security allows broadcast operators to enable consumers to share their content on multimedia devices without the risk of piracy. In March 2014, DLNA publicly released the VidiPath Guidelines, originally called \\"DLNA CVP-2 Guidelines.\\" VidiPath enables consumers to view subscription TV content on a wide variety of devices including televisions, tablets, phones, Blu-ray players, set top boxes (STBs), personal computers (PCs) and game consoles without any additional intermediate devices from the service provider. As of September 2014, over 25,000 different device models had obtained \\"DLNA Certified\\" status, indicated by a logo on their packaging and confirming their interoperability with other devices. It was estimated that by 2017 over 6 billion DLNA-certified devices, from digital cameras to game consoles and TVs, would be installed in users' homes. the organization claimed membership of \\"more than 200 companies\\". On January 5, 2017, DLNA announced on its web site that \\"the organization has fulfilled its mission and will dissolve as a non- profit trade association.\\" Its certification program will be conducted by SpireSpark International of Portland, Oregon. History Intel established the DLNA along with Sony and Microsoft in June 2003 as the Digital Home Working Group, changing its name 12 months later, when the first set of guidelines for DLNA was published. Home Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines v1.5 was published in March 2006 and expanded in October of the same year; the changes included the addition of two new product categories ‚Äî printers, and mobile devices ‚Äî as well as an \\"increase of DLNA Device Classes from two to twelve\\" and an increase in supported user scenarios related to the new product categories. Specification The DLNA Certified Device Classes are separated as follows: =Home Network Devices= * Digital Media Server (DMS): store content and make it available to networked digital media players (DMP) and digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include PCs and network- attached storage (NAS) devices. * Digital Media Player (DMP): find content on digital media servers (DMS) and provide playback and rendering capabilities. Examples include TVs, stereos and home theaters, wireless monitors and game consoles. * Digital Media Renderer (DMR): play content as instructed by a digital media controller (DMC), which will find content from a digital media server (DMS). Examples include TVs, audio/video receivers, video displays and remote speakers for music. It is possible for a single device (e.g. TV, A/V receiver, etc.) to function both as a DMR (receives \\"pushed\\" content from DMS) and DMP (\\"pulls\\" content from DMS). * Digital Media Controller (DMC): find content on digital media servers (DMS) and instruct digital media renderers (DMR) to play the content. Content does not stream from or through the DMC. Examples include tablet computers, Wi-Fi enabled digital cameras and smartphones. * Generally, digital media players (DMP) and digital media controllers (DMC) with print capability can print to DMPr. Examples include networked photo printers and networked all-in-one printers. =Mobile Handheld Devices= * Mobile Digital Media Server (M-DMS): store content and make it available to wired/wireless networked mobile digital media players (M-DMP), and digital media renderers. Examples include mobile phones and portable music players. * Mobile Digital Media Player (M-DMP): find and play content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include mobile phones and mobile media tablets designed for viewing multimedia content. * Mobile Digital Media Uploader (M-DMU): send (upload) content to a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include digital cameras and mobile phones. * Mobile Digital Media Downloader (M-DMD): find and store (download) content from a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include portable music players and mobile phones. * Mobile Digital Media Controller (M-DMC): find content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS) and send it to digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. =Home Infrastructure Devices= * Mobile Network Connectivity Function (M-NCF): provide a bridge between mobile handheld device network connectivity and home network connectivity. * Media Interoperability Unit (MIU): provide content transformation between required media formats for home network and mobile handheld devices. The specification uses DTCP-IP as \\"link protection\\" for copyright-protected commercial content between one device to another. =DLNA guideline versions= * 1.0: released June 2004; 2 volumes: Architecture & Protocols, Media Formats; 2 Device Classes: DMP, DMS; About 50 media format profiles * 1.5: released March 2006; 3 volumes: Architecture & Protocols, Media Formats, and Link Protection; 12 Devices Classes and 5 Device Capabilities; About 250 media format profiles * 2.0: released August 2015; Includes topics like EPG, Content Sync, RUI, WPS, Media Formats, Scheduled recording, DRM * 3.0: released August 2015; enhanced response time, improved power efficiency, HEVC support * 4.0: released June 2016; solves the \\"media format not supported\\" problem between PCs, TVs and mobile devices while supporting Ultra HD TV content streaming Member companies As of November 2015, there are 13 promoter members and 171 contributor members. The promoter members are: Arris, AwoX, Broadcom, CableLabs, Comcast, Dolby Laboratories, Intel, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung Electronics, Sony Electronics, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon. Neither Google nor Apple are members. Apple's proprietary Digital Audio Access Protocol preceded DLNA's UPnP protocols. The board of directors oversees the activity of the four following committees: * Ecosystem Committee, planning the future development of DLNA guidelines * Compliance & Test Committee, overseeing the certification program and its evolutions * Marketing Communication Advisory Council, actively promoting DLNA worldwide * Technical Committee, writing the DLNA guidelines Products supporting DLNA =DLNA- certified devices= There are over 25,000 DLNA-certified products on the market, up from 9,000 in 2011. This includes TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, games consoles, digital media players, photo frames, cameras, NAS devices, PCs, mobile handsets, and more. According to a study from Parks Associates, nearly 3 billion products are on the market in 2014 reaching up to over 7 billion by 2018. Consumers can see if their product is certified by looking for a DLNA logo on the device or by verifying certification through the DLNA Product Search.. Manufacturers can seek certification testing from a DLNA Accredited Independent Certification Vendor such as the UNH InterOperability Laboratory,. Allion Labs, CESI Technology Co., Digital TV Labs,. XXCAL or Testronic.. =DLNA technology components= As the past president of DLNA pointed out to the Register in March 2009:. DLNA Interoperability Guidelines allow manufacturers to participate in the growing marketplace of networked devices and are separated into the following sections of key technology components: * Network and Connectivity * Device and Service Discovery and Control * Media Format and Transport Model * Media Management, Distribution and Control * Digital Rights Management and Content Protection * Manageability =DLNA-certified software= In 2005, DLNA began a software certification program in order to make it easier for consumers to share their digital media across a broader range of products. DLNA is certifying software that is sold directly to consumers through retailers, websites and mobile application stores. With DLNA certified software, consumers can upgrade products from within their home networks that may not be DLNA certified and bring them into their personal DLNA ecosystems. This helps in bringing content such as videos, photos and music stored on DLNA certified devices to a larger selection of consumer electronics, mobile and PC products. =DLNA-certified products= Some examples:. =Servers= * AllShare (UPnP, DLNA), a Samsung-branded media server for MS Windows.

Muslims often use the term \\"Mothers of the Believers\\" prominently before or after referring to them as a sign of respect, a term derived from the Quran. Muhammad was monogamous for 25 years when married to his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. After her death in 619 CE, he over time married a number of women. His life is traditionally delineated by two epochs: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca, a city in western Arabia, from the year 570 to 622 CE, and post-hijra in Medina, from 622 until his death in 632. All but two of his marriages were contracted after the Hegira (or Hijra - migration to Medina). Of his 13 wives, only two bore him children: Khadija and Maria al-Qibtiyya. Background =Objectives= In Arabian culture, marriage was contracted in accordance with the larger needs of the tribe and was based on the need to form alliances within the tribe and with other tribes. Virginity at the time of a first marriage was emphasized as a tribal honor.Amira Sonbol, ‚ÄúRise of Islam: 6th to 9th century‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures Watt states that all of Muhammad's marriages had the political aspect of strengthening friendly relationships and were based on the Arabian custom.Watt (1956), p. 287 Esposito points out that some of Muhammad's marriages were aimed at providing a livelihood for widows.Esposito (1998), pp. 16‚Äì18. He noted that remarriage was difficult for widows in a society that emphasized virgin marriages.John Esposito. Islam: The Straight Path. Oxford University Press. pp. 17‚Äì18. F.E. Peters says that it is hard to make generalizations about Muhammad's marriages: many of them were political, some compassionate, and some perhaps affairs of the heart.F.E. Peters (2003). p. 84 The objectives of Muhammad's marriages have been described as:Anwar Al Awlaki, The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, the Makkan Period, CD 5 # Helping out the widows of his companions. # Creating family bonds between him and his companions (Muhammad married the daughters of Abu Bakr and Umar, whereas Uthman and Ali married his daughters. He therefore had family bonds with all the first four Caliphs). # Spreading the message by uniting different clans through marriage. # Increasing credibility and sources for conveying his private family life. If he only had one wife, then it would have been a tremendous responsibility on her to convey Muhammad's private acts of worship and family life, and people would try to discredit her to destroy the credibility of these practices. However, with multiple wives, there were a lot more sources to the knowledge, making it more difficult to discredit it. Therefore, his marriages gave more women the opportunity to learn and teach the matters of his private life. Muhammad's first marriage was at the age of about 25 to Khadijah. He was monogamously married to her for 25 years until her death, after which he is believed to have had multiple wives for the reasons explained above. With the exception of Aisha, Muhammad only married widows and divorc√©es or captives. =Terminology= \\"Mother of the Believers\\" is a term by which each of Muhammad's wives came to be prefixed over time. It is derived from the Quran (33:6): \\"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers\\" is applied to all of the wives. Family life Muhammad and his family lived in small apartments adjacent to the mosque at Medina. Each of these was six to seven spans wide (5.5 feet) and ten spans long (7.5 feet). The height of the ceiling was that of an average man standing. The blankets were used as curtains to screen the doors.Numani, p. 259-60 According to an account by Anas bin Malik, \\"The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number.\\" I asked Anas, \\"Had the Prophet the strength for it?\\" Anas replied, \\"We used to say that the Prophet was given the strength of thirty (men).\\" And Sa'id said on the authority of Qatada that Anas had told him about nine wives only (not eleven).\\": Narrated Qatada: Anas bin Malik said, \\"The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number.\\" I asked Anas, \\"Had the Prophet the strength for it?\\" Anas replied, \\"We used to say that the Prophet was given the strength of thirty (men).\\" And Sa'id said on the authority of Qatada that Anas had told him about nine wives only (not eleven).\\" Although Muhammad's wives had a special status as Mothers of the Believers, he did not allow them to use his status as a prophet to obtain special treatment in public.Ramadan (2007), p. 168-9 Muhammad's marriages =Khadijah bint Khuwaylid= At the age of 25, Muhammad wed his wealthy employer, the 28- or 40-year-old daughter of a merchant, Khadija. This marriage, his first, would be both happy and monogamous; Muhammad would rely on Khadija in many ways, until her death 25 years later.Esposito (1998), p.18Reeves (2003), p. 46 They had two sons, Qasim and Abd-Allah (nicknamed al-·π¨ƒÅhir and al-·π¨ayyib respectively), both died young, and four daughters‚ÄîZaynab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah. Shia scholars dispute the paternity of Khadija's daughters, as they view the first three of them as the daughters from previous marriages and only Fatimah as the daughter of Muhammad and Khadija. Muhammad al-Tijani in his The Shi'a: The Real Followers of the Sunnah on Al-Islam.org note 274 During their marriage, Khadija purchased the slave Zayd ibn Harithah, then adopted the young man as her son at Muhammad's request. Muhammad Husayn Haykal. The Life of Muhammad : \\"From Marriage to Prophethood.\\" Translated by Isma'il Razi A. al-Faruqi Abu Talib and Khadija died in the same year. He declared the year as Aam ul-Huzn (year of sorrow). =Hijrah (migration) to Medina= Sawda bint Zam øa Before he left for Medina, it was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim that he marry Sawda bint Zam øa, who had suffered many hardships after she became a Muslim. Prior to that, Sawda was married to a paternal cousin of hers named As-Sakran bin ‚ÄòAmr, and had five or six sons from her previous marriage. There are disagreements in Muslim tradition whether Muhammad first married Sawda or Aisha, but Sawda is usually regarded as his second wife and she was living with him before Aisha joined the household. In one account, he married Sawda in Shawwal, when Sawda was about 55 years old, in the tenth year of prophethood, after the death of Khadija. At about the same period, Aisha was betrothed to him.Watt,\\"Aisha bint Abu Bakr\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Online As Sawda got older, and some time after Muhammad's marriage to Umm Salama, some sources claim that Muhammad wished to divorce Sawda. Some traditions maintain that Muhammad did not intend to divorce her, but only Sawda feared or thought that he would. Ibn Kathir says that Muhammad was worried that Sawda might be upset about having to compete with so many younger wives, and offered to divorce her. Sawda offered to give her turn of Muhammad's conjugal visits to Aisha, of whom she was very fond, stating that she \\"was old, and cared not for men; her only desire was to rise on the Day of Judgment as one of his wives\\". While some Muslim historians cite this story as a reason of revelation, citing Quran 4:128, others like Rashid Rida dispute this whole account as \\"poorly supported\\", or mursal. Aisha bint Abu Bakr Aisha was the daughter of Muhammad's close friend Abu Bakr. She was initially betrothed to Jubayr ibn Mu·π≠ Ωim, a Muslim whose father, though pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. When Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that Muhammad marry Aisha after the death of Muhammad's first wife (Khadija), the previous agreement regarding marriage of Aisha with ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent. The majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina., , , , , , , , , Aisha's age at marriage has been a source of controversy and debate, and some historians, Islamic scholars, and Muslim writers have challenged the previously-accepted timeline of her life. Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the Al- Masjid al-Nabawi mosque.Nomani (1970), p. 257-9 According to Sunni belief, Aisha was extremely scholarly and inquisitive (the Shia belief is somewhat different, considering her role in The Battle of Camel against Ali, along with other matters). Her contribution to the spread of Muhammad's message was extraordinary, and she served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death. She is also known for narrating 2210 hadith,Islamyat: a core text for students not just on matters related to Muhammad's private life, but also on topics such as marriage, sex, inheritance, pilgrimage, eschatology, among other subjects. She was highly regarded for her intellect and knowledge in various fields, including poetry and medicine, which received plenty of praise by early luminaries, such as the historian Al-Zuhri and her student Urwa ibn al-Zubayr. =Widows of the war with Mecca= Hafsa bint Umar and Zaynab bint Khuzayma During the Muslim war with Mecca, many men were killed leaving behind widows and orphans. Hafsa bint Umar, daughter of Umar (‚ÄòUmar bin Al-Khattab), was widowed at battle of Badr when her husband Khunais ibn Hudhaifa was killed in action. Muhammad married her in 3 A.H./625 C.E.Nomani (1970), p. 360 Zaynab bint Khuzayma was also widowed at the battle of Uhad. She was the wife of 'Ubaydah b. al-HƒÅrith,Watt(1956), p. 393 a faithful Muslim and from the tribe of al-Muttalib, for which Muhammad had special responsibility.Watt(1956), p. 287 When her husband died, Muhammad aiming to provide for her, married her in 4 A.H. She was nicknamed Umm Al-Masakeen (roughly translates as the mother of the poor), because of her kindness and charity.Lings (1983), p. 201 Close to Aisha's age, the two younger wives Hafsa and Zaynab were welcomed into the household. Sawda, who was much older, extended her motherly benevolence to the younger women. Aisha and Hafsa had a lasting relationship. As for Zaynab, however, she became ill and died about three months after her marriage.Lings (1983), p. 165Lings (1983), p. 206Nomani (1970), p. 345 Hind bint Suhayl (Umm Salama) The death of Zaynab coincided with that of Abu Salamah, a devout Muslim and Muhammad's foster brother, as a result of his wounds from the Battle of Uhud. Abu Salamah's widow, Umm Salama, also a devoted Muslim, had none but her young children. Her man-less plight reportedly saddened the Muslims, and after her iddah some Muslims proposed marriage to her; but she declined. When Muhammad proposed her marriage, she was reluctant for three reasons: she claimed to suffer from jealousy and pointed out the prospect of an unsuccessful marriage, her old age, and her young family that needed support. But Muhammad replied that he would pray to God to free her from jealousy, that he too was of old age, and that her family was like his family. She married Muhammad around the end of 4 AH.Umm Salamah.

Rayhana bint Zayd In 626, Rayhana bint Zayd, was a Jewish woman from the Banu Nadir tribe, enslaved along with others after the defeat of the Banu Qurayza tribe. =Internal dissension= After Muhammad's final battle against his Meccan enemies, he diverted his attention to stopping the Banu Mustaliq's raid on Medina. During this skirmish, Medinan dissidents, begrudging Muhammad's influence, attempted to attack him in the more sensitive areas of his life, including his marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh,Watt (1956), 330-1 and an incident in which Aisha left her camp to search for her lost necklace, and returned with a Companion of Muhammad.Denise A. Spellberg, Aisha bint Abƒ´ Bakr, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an Zaynab bint Jahsh Zaynab bint Jahsh was Muhammad's cousin, the daughter of one of his father's sisters.Watt (1974), p.156-159 In Medina Muhammad arranged the widowed Zaynab's marriage to his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Caesar E. Farah states that Muhammad was determined to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted.Caesar E. Farah, Islam: Beliefs and Observances, p.69 Zaynab disapproved of the marriage, and her brothers rejected it, because according to Ibn Sa'd, she was of aristocratic lineage and Zayd was a former slave.Watt (1974), p. 158. Watt states that it is not clear why Zaynab was unwilling to marry Zayd as Muhammad esteemed him highly. He postulates that Zaynab, being an ambitious woman, was already hoping to marry Muhammad; or that she might have wanted to marry someone of whom Muhammad disapproved for political reasons.Watt (1974), p. 157-158. According to Maududi, after the Qur'anic verse was revealed, Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd. Zaynab's marriage was unharmonious.Freyer Stowasser (1996), p. 88, Oxford University Press According to Watt, it is almost certain that she was working for marriage with Muhammad before the end of 626. \\"Zaynab had dressed in haste when she was told 'the Messenger of God is at the door.' She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: 'Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!'\\" Zaynab told Zayd about this, and he offered to divorce her, but Muhammad told him to keep her. The story laid much stress on Zaynab's perceived beauty. Nomani considers this story to be a rumor.Nomani (1970). Sirat al-Nabi. Watt doubts the accuracy of this portion of the narrative, since it does not occur in the earliest source. He thinks that even if there is a basis of fact underlying the narrative, it would have been subject to exaggeration in the course of transmission as the later Muslims liked to maintain that there was no celibacy and monkery in Islam. Rodinson disagrees with Watt arguing that the story is stressed in the traditional texts and that it would not have aroused any adverse comment or criticism. This story has been rejected by most Muslim scholarsIbn Al-‚ÄôArabi, Ahkam Al-Quran (3/1543)Sirat-Un-Nabi, by Allama Shibli Nu'ManiDr. Yasir Qadhi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbaorsGGFio mainly because of its lack of having any chain of narration and its complete absence from any authentic hadith. Some commentatorsFor example Qadi Iyad ibn Musa al- Yahsubi have found it absurd that Muhammad would suddenly become aware of Zaynab's beauty one day after having known her all her life; if her beauty had been the reason for Muhammad to marry her, he would have married her himself in the first place rather than arranging her marriage to Zayd. Muhammad, fearing public opinion, was initially reluctant to marry Zaynab. The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons. According to Watt, this \\"conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child's paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam.\\"William Montgomery Watt (1974), p.233 The Qur'an, however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God. It implied that treating adopted sons as real sons was objectionable and that there should now be a complete break with the past. Thus Muhammad, confident that he was strong enough to face public opinion, proceeded to reject these taboos.Watt(1956), p.330-1 When Zaynab's waiting period was complete, Muhammad married her.Watt, p. 156. An influential faction in Medina, called \\"Hypocrites\\" in the Islamic tradition,Freyer Stowasser (1996), p. 89 did indeed criticize the marriage as incestuous. Attempting to divide the Muslim community, they spread rumors as part of a strategy of attacking Muhammad through his wives. According to Ibn Kathir, the relevant Qur'anic verses were a \\"divine rejection\\" of the Hypocrites' objections. According to Rodinson, doubters argued the verses were in exact conflict with social taboos and favored Muhammad too much. The delivery of these verses, thus, did not end the dissent.Rodinson, p. 207. Necklace incident Aisha had accompanied Muhammad on his skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq. On the way back, Aisha lost her necklace which she had borrowed from her sister Asma Bint Abu Bakr (a treasured possession), and Muhammad required the army to stop so that it could be found. The necklace was found, but during the same journey, Aisha lost it again. This time, she quietly slipped out in search for it, but by the time she recovered it, the caravan had moved on. She was eventually taken home by Safw'an bin Mu'attal.Peterson (2007), p. 169-71 Rumors spread that A'isha and Safw'an committed adultery although there were no witnesses to this.D. A. Spellberg, Politics, Gender, and the Islamic Past: the Legacy of A'isha bint Abi Bakr, Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 40 Disputes arose, and the community was split into factions. Meanwhile, Aisha had been ill, and unaware of the stories. At first, Muhammad himself was unsure of what to believe, but eventually trusted Aisha's protestations of innocence. Eventually, verses of surah Nur were revealed to Muhammad, establishing her innocence, and condemning the slanders and the libel. Although the episode was uneasy for both Muhammad and Aisha, in the end, it reinforced their mutual love and trust.Ramadan (2007), p. 121 According to shia (Allameh Tabataba'), revealing of Nur's verses belongs to Maria al-Qibtiyya, another wife of Muhammad. Also the accuracy of incident free from which wife of Muhammad, isn't confirmed by shia scholar (Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi), because the Ismah of Muhammad is violated. =Reconciliation= Juwayriyya bint al-Harith One of the captives from the skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq was Juwayriyya bint al-Harith, who was the daughter of the tribe's chieftain. Her husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among the booty of Muhammad's companion Thabit b. Qays b. Al-Shammas. Upon being enslaved, Juwayriyya went to Muhammad requesting that she - as the daughter of the lord of the Mustaliq - be released, however he refused. Meanwhile, her father approached Muhammad with ransom to secure her release, but Muhammed still refused to release her. Muhammad then offered to marry her, and she accepted.Rodinson, p. 196. When it became known that tribes persons of Mustaliq were kinsmen of the prophet of Islam through marriage, the Muslims began releasing their captives.Lings (1983), p. 241-2 Thus, Muhammad's marriage resulted in the freedom of nearly one hundred families whom he had recently enslaved.Nomani, p. 365-6 Safiyya bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab Safiyya bint Huyayy was a noblewoman,Al-Shati', 1971, 171 the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir, who was executed after surrendering at the Battle of the Trench.Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah.

AkÃ≤htab, Encyclopedia of Islam and second to Kenana ibn al-Rabi, a commander. In 628, at the Battle of Khaybar,Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 510. Banu Nadir was defeated, her husband was executed and she was taken as a prisoner. Muhammad freed her from her captor Dihya and proposed marriage, which Safiyya accepted. According to Martin Lings, Muhammad had given Safiyyah the choice of returning to the defeated Banu Nadir, or becoming Muslim and marrying him, and Safiyyah opted for the latter choice.Martin Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based On The Earliest Sources (George Allen & Unwin, 1983), p. 269 According to a hadith, Muhammad's contemporaries believed that due to Safiyya's high status, it was only befitting that she be manumitted and married to Muhammad. Volume 1, Book 8, Number 367: Narrated 'Abdul 'Aziz Modern scholars believe that Muhammad married Safiyya as part of reconciliation with the Jewish tribe and as a gesture of goodwill.Nomani(1970) p. 424.Watt (1964) p. 195 John L. Esposito states that the marriage may have been political or to cement alliances.John L. Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, pp. 19-20Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Musnad, vol. 13, p. 168, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172) Haykal opines that Muhammad's manumission of and marriage to Safiyaa was partly in order to alleviate her tragedy and partly to preserve their dignity, and compares these actions to previous conquerors who married the daughters and wives of the kings whom they had defeated.Muhammad Husayn Haykal, The Life of Muhammad (North American Trust Publications, 1976), p. 373 According to some, by marrying Safiyyah, Muhammad aimed at ending the enmity and hostility between Jews and Islam. Muhammad convinced Safiyya to convert to Islam.Rodinson (1971), p. 254. According to Al-Bayhaqi, Safiyyah was initially angry at Muhammad as both her father and husband had been killed. Muhammad explained \\"Your father charged the Arabs against me and committed heinous acts.\\" Eventually, Safiyyah got rid of her bitterness against Muhammad.Al-Bayhaqi, Dala'il an-Nubuwwah, vol. 4, p. 230 According to Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Safiyya came to appreciate the love and honor Muhammad gave her, and said, \\"I have never seen a good-natured person as the Messenger of Allah\\".Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Musnad, vol. 13, p. 38, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172) Safiyyah remained loyal to Muhammad until he died.Muhammad Husayn Haykal, The Life of Muhammad (North American Trust Publications, p. 374 According to Islamic tradition, Safiyya was beautiful, patient, intelligent, learned and gentle, and she respected Muhammad as \\"Allah's Messenger\\". Muslim scholars state she had many good moral qualities.Safiyah Bint Huyeiy Ibn Akhtab, www.islamonline.com She is described as a humble worshiper and a pious believer. Ibn Kathir said, \\"she was one of the best women in her worship, piousness, ascetism, devoutness, and charity\\".Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidayah wa an- Nihayah, vol. 8, p. 47, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.177 According to Ibn Sa'd, Safiyyah was very charitable and generous. She used to give out and spend whatever she had; she gave away a house that she had when she was still alive.Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol. 8, p. 102, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.178 Upon entering Muhammad's household, Safiyya became friends with Aisha and Hafsa. Also, she offered gifts to Fatima. She gave some of Muhammad's other wives gifts from her jewels that she brought with her from Khaybar.Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol.8, p.100, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172 However, some of Muhammad's other wives spoke ill of Safiyya's Jewish descent. Muhammad intervened, pointing out to everyone that Safiyya's \\"husband is Muhammad, father is Aaron, and uncle is Moses\\", a reference to revered prophets.Al- Shati', 1971, 178-181 Muhammad once went to hajj with all his wives. On the way Safiyya's camel knelt down, as it was the weakest in the caravan, and she started to weep. Muhammad came to her and wiped her tears with his dress and hands, but the more he asked her not to cry, the more she went on weeping.Ahmad, vol.6, p. 337, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.176 When Muhammad was terminally ill, Safiyya was profoundly upset. She said to him \\"I wish it was I who was suffering instead of you.\\" Ramla bint Abi Sufyan (Umm Habiba) In the same year, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with his Meccan enemies, the Quraysh effectively ending the state of war between the two parties. He soon married the daughter of the Quraysh leader, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, aimed at further reconciling his opponents.Watt (1961), p. 195 He sent a proposal for marriage to Ramla bint Abi Sufyan, who, was in Abyssinia at the time when she learned her husband had died. She had previously converted to Islam (in Mecca) against her father's will. After her migration to Abyssinia her husband had converted to Christianity. Umm Habibah: Ramlah Bin Abi Sufyan . IslamOnline. Muhammad dispatched ‚ÄòAmr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to the Negus (king), asking him for Umm Habiba‚Äôs hand ‚Äî that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Maria al-Qibtiyya Maria al-Qibtiyya was an Egyptian Coptic Christian, sent as a gift to Muhammad from Muqawqis, a Byzantine official.A. Guillaume (1955), p. 653 and bore him a son named Ibrahim, who died in infancy. Maymuna binti al-Harith As part of the treaty of Hudaybiyah, Muhammad visited Mecca for the lesser pilgrimage. There Maymuna bint al-Harith proposed marriage to him.Al-Shati', 1971, 222-224 Muhammad accepted, and thus married Maymuna, the sister-in-law of Abbas, a longtime ally of his. By marrying her, Muhammad also established kinship ties with the banu Makhzum, his previous opponents.Ramadan (2007), p. 1701 As the Meccans did not allow him to stay any longer, Muhammad left the city, taking Maymuna with him. Her original name was \\"Barra\\" but he called her \\"Maymuna\\", meaning the blessed, as his marriage to her had also marked the first time in seven years when he could enter his hometown Mecca. =Muhammad's widows= al-Baqƒ´ ø Cemetery. Central rectangle just in front of Main Gate. al-Baqƒ´ ø Cemetery, Medina. According to the Qur'an, God forbade anyone to marry the wives of Muhammad, because of their respect and honour, after he died. > Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye > should marry his wives after him at any time. The extent of Muhammad's property at the time of his death is unclear. Although Qur'an [2.180] clearly addresses issues of inheritance, Abu Bakr, the new leader of the Muslim ummah, refused to divide Muhammad's property among his widows and heirs, saying that he had heard Muhammad say: :We (Prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity. Muhammad's widow Hafsa played a role in the collection of the first Qur'anic manuscript. After Abu Bakr had collected the copy, he gave it to Hafsa, who preserved it until Uthman took it, copied it and distributed it in Muslim lands.Al-Shati', 1971, p. 110 Some of Muhammad's widows were active politically in the Islamic state after Muhammad's death. Safiyya, for example, aided the Caliph Uthman during his siege. During the first fitna, some wives also took sides. Umm Salama, for example, sided with Ali, and sent her son Umar for help.Al-Shati', 1971, p. 135 The last of Muhammad's wives, Umm Salama lived to hear about the tragedy of Karbala in 680, dying the same year. The grave of the wives of Muhammed is located at al-Baqƒ´ ø Cemetery, Medina.

The name mbuna means \\"rockfish\\" in the language of the Tonga people of Malawi.Loiselle Paul V. (1988) A Fishkeepers Guide to African Cichlids. p 97. Salamander Books, London & New York, . As the name implies, most mbuna are cichlids that live among the piles of rocks and along the rocky shores of Lake Malawi, as opposed to the utaka, cichlids that live in the open water or on sandy shores or soft substrates. Some species of mbuna are highly sexually dimorphic, although many are not. Among biologists, almost all of the cichlid species of Lake Malawi, including mbuna and non mbuna such as the utaka, are believed to have descended from one or a very few species that became isolated in the lake. With rising water levels, new habitats could be colonized and the many isolated rocky outcrops allowed new mbuna species to form.Givnish, T.J.; and K.J. Sytsma, editors (1997). Molecular Evolution and Adaptive Radiation, p. 598. . Their striking colors, intriguing behavioral characteristics, and relative hardiness make them very popular despite their unique demands for the home aquarist.  Mbuna in aquaria  While many haplochromines tend to be colorful in males though dull in females, both sexes of mbuna often have striking coloration. This is a pair of kenyi cichlids, Maylandia lombardoi. These cichlids are some of the most colorful freshwater fish for the home aquarium. Mbuna are very aggressive and territorial fish, they are not suitable for beginner fishkeepers. A suitable aquarium setting includes many rocks, adequate filtration, caves, and hiding places; plants may be uprooted, so they are best avoided, but a small number will work well in the aquarium. One of these is Java fern, which may become the object of mbuna aggression, but will not be eaten due to an undesirable taste. Social behavior Mbuna exhibit strong social behavior and establish a clearly visible social hierarchy including well-defined and enforced territories. A dominant male maintains a spherical territory, only allowing females to enter this territory for breeding purposes. Overcrowding helps spread out the aggression caused by these territorial conflicts. They, like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders and breed readily in good conditions.  Water parameters  All species from Lake Malawi thrive in the temperature range of 77-84 ¬∞F. pH 7.5-8.4 is ideal with an almost pristine (near 0 ppm) ammonia and ammonium nitrite content.  Notable mbuna cichlids  Many mbuna cichlids are regularly stocked and sold by pet shops. Some of the most common ones are the bumblebee cichlid or hornet (Pseudotropheus crabro), golden cichlid (Melanochromis auratus), electric yellow or yellow lab cichlid (Labidochromis caeruleus), red zebra cichlid (Maylandia estherae), blue zebra (Maylandia callainos), and Melanochromis cyaneorhabdos (blue johannii). Many of these species are considered to have large territorial needs and aggressively defend these territories. Cichlids belonging to any of the genera listed below are considered mbuna.

A Ross Sea aspect of the mountains was first obtained by early British expeditions of Ross, Borchgrevink, Scott and Shackleton.

Founded in 1830, the school has an enrollment of more than 1,500 students. The college offers bachelor's degrees.  History  Randolph‚ÄìMacon was founded in 1830 by Methodists Rev. Hekeziah G. Leigh and Staten Islander Gabriel Poillon Disosway. The school is the second-oldest Methodist-run college in the country, and the oldest in continuous operation. It was originally located in Boydton, near the North Carolina border; but as the railroad link to Boydton was destroyed during the Civil War, the college's trustees decided to relocate the school to Ashland in 1868. The college takes its name from Virginia statesmen John Randolph of Roanoke and North Carolina statesman Nathaniel Macon. (The original site of Randolph‚ÄìMacon features a historical marker and ruins of the classroom buildings.) In 1847, Randolph‚ÄìMacon College established a relationship with the Hampden‚ÄìSydney College. The relationship led to the formation of the Randolph‚ÄìMacon Medical School, which closed in 1851.Landmarks Visited Catalog: Randolph-Macon Medical School Its president William A. Smith delivered a set of lectures advocating slavery in 1856 and 1857.http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/smith/bio.html The college has a historical relationship with Randolph College (formerly known as Randolph‚ÄìMacon Woman's College) in Lynchburg, Virginia. The former women's college was founded under Randolph‚ÄìMacon's original charter in 1893 by the then-president William Waugh Smith; it was intended as a female counterpart to the then all-male Randolph‚ÄìMacon. The two schools later separated to become distinct institutions governed by two separate boards. Randolph‚ÄìMacon College became co-educational in 1971 with the enrollment of 50 women and the first full-time female faculty member. (Randolph College became co-educational in 2007.) In 1892, two preparatory schools ‚Äî both called Randolph‚ÄìMacon Academy ‚Äî were founded. The only one that remains today is Randolph‚ÄìMacon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia. Randolph‚ÄìMacon Academy is today the only co-educational military boarding school in the country affiliated with the United States Air Force Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC). Currently, there are no formal relationships or agreements between Randolph-Macon Academy and Randolph‚ÄìMacon College aside from the shared names, mascots, and school colors. Randolph‚ÄìMacon College became the first college south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line to require physical education coursework for graduation. The old gym, built in 1887, was the first structure in the South to be constructed solely for instruction in physical education. Randolph‚ÄìMacon is considered to be the first college in the South to offer English as a full discipline and to develop biology as a distinct study.Scanlon, James. Randolph-Macon College: A Southern History, 1825-1967. University Press of Virginia, 1983. Its computer science department is one of the oldest in the country associated with a liberal arts school; in the 1960s when the program was established, many academics believed computer science to be more appropriate for a commercial trade or secretarial school than a traditional four-year institution. Since 1923, the college has been home to the Zeta of Virginia chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the nation's oldest academic honor society. Chi Beta Phi, the national science honorary society, was founded at Randolph‚ÄìMacon in 1916.History of Randolph-Macon College  Academics  Randolph‚ÄìMacon offers two undergraduate degrees: the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science. All students must satisfy the general collegiate curriculum, which requires them to take courses in each of the college's \\"Areas of Knowledge:\\" civilizations, arts and literature, natural and social sciences, mathematics, foreign languages, and wellness. The student-faculty ratio is 12:1. = Calendar = Randolph‚ÄìMacon operates on a 4-1-4 academic calendar. This allows for two four-month semesters (fall and spring) with a one-month term in January to split up the semesters. During the January Term (colloquially called \\"J-Term\\"), students are afforded the opportunity to take intensive study courses on the Randolph‚ÄìMacon campus, travel the globe as part of a study-abroad course, or participate in professional internships in their field(s) of study and interest. = Four-Year Degree Guarantee = In 2011, Randolph‚ÄìMacon announced a Four-Year Degree Guarantee program. The College guarantees that entering freshmen will graduate in four calendar years and, if qualifying students are not able to meet that requirement, then Randolph‚ÄìMacon College will waive tuition costs for the courses that the student needs to complete their degree.  Facilities  Randolph‚ÄìMacon College has over 60 academic, administrative, athletic, and residential buildings on its campus of located in the heart of Ashland, Virginia. The oldest building is Washington- Franklin Hall, built in 1872, soon after the college moved to Ashland from Boydton. It was the first brick building in Ashland, and its construction was funded by the students. Renovated in 1987, Washington-Franklin Hall now houses the history department. Pace-Armistead Hall was built in 1876 (renovated 1997) and originally housed the chemistry department. Today, it is home to the studio art department, including the Flippo Art Gallery. The original Duncan Methodist Church was built in 1879 and was renovated to include classrooms and offices for the music and arts departments. All three buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and collectively they make up \\"Historic Campus.\\" Copley Science Center is the largest academic building on campus. The biology, chemistry, physics/astrophysics, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics departments are all located in Copley. Copley Science Center was built as an extension of Smithey Hall, which today houses the psychology department. Just north of Copley is Keeble Observatory, which includes a 12\\" Cassegrain reflector optical telescope, and two radio telescopes. Randolph‚ÄìMacon has one main library: McGraw-Page Library. Formerly, the library was located in Peele Hall, which is now the main administrative building on-campus and includes the Copy Center, Registrar's Office, Human Resources, provost, dean of students, and the president. There are 12 residence halls on campus. The seven halls on the north end of campus are collectively known as the Freshman Village. About 75% of the college's freshmen live in one of those halls. The four located near the center of campus house upperclassmen and the remaining freshmen. These include the two oldest residence halls - Thomas Branch Hall and Mary Branch Hall. The college also owns most of the fraternity and sorority houses, other houses devoted to special interest groups, and on-campus townhouses (usually reserved for seniors). Andrews Hall, named after former Dean of Students Rev. Ira Andrews, opened in fall 2011. The newest residence hall, Birdsong Hall, named for Constance and Thomas Birdsong '49, opened in fall 2014. Birdsong Hall provides state-of-the-art housing for upperclassmen, including common areas, study rooms, and laundry facilities. The College announced a $100 million capital campaign in 2011. A large portion of the funds will go toward enhancing facilities, including two new residence halls, new football and baseball fields and stadiums, additions and renovations to the McGraw-Page Library and Copley Science Center, along with the destruction of the Brown Campus Center that was rebuilt into the Brock Commons in 2013. The main north-south railroad line for the east coast runs through the campus. Most of the campus is located to the east of the railroad, but a handful of college offices, special interest houses, and athletic fields are located to the west of the tracks. The Ashland train station (not part of the R-MC campus) is directly across from the southern entrance to the campus.  Athletics  Randolph‚ÄìMacon's sports teams are known as the Yellow Jackets or, more simply, as \\"The Jackets.\\" Randolph‚ÄìMacon College plays in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC), a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Men's volleyball will be added in the 2019 season (2018‚Äì19 school year). The college maintains a Hall of Fame of former especially accomplished athletes based upon their past athletic records.

Founded in 1925, CGU is a member of the Claremont Colleges which includes five undergraduate (Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College, Pitzer College) and two graduate (CGU and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences) institutions of higher education. The university is organized into seven separate units: the School of Arts & Humanities; School of Community & Global Health; Drucker School of Management; School of Educational Studies; the School of Social Science, Policy, & Evaluation; the Center for Information Systems & Technology; and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\".  History  Founded in 1925, CGU was the second of the Claremont Colleges to form, following Pomona College and preceding Scripps College. The school has undergone several name changes since its inception. After being called Claremont University College for thirty-seven years, in 1962 the school officially became known as Claremont Graduate School and University Center. Five years later, in 1967, the name was again changed to Claremont University Center, and in 1998 it acquired the name Claremont Graduate University. The Claremont Colleges were designed to incorporate the Oxford Model of higher education. Instead of one large university composed of several separate schools, the Claremont Colleges are made up of different institutions designed around differing theories of pedagogy. CGU was founded upon the principle that graduate education is separate and distinct from undergraduate education. Students discover and cultivate their disciplines during undergraduate course work; at CGU students continue cultivation of their own disciplines, but are also expected to augment this with research that incorporates other disciplines as well. This is called \\"Transdisciplinarity\\" and is an essential component of Claremont Graduate University's functioning theory of pedagogy. The school is home to more than 2,000 master's and PhD students, as well as approximately 200 full and part-time faculty members. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has classified Claremont Graduate University as a CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) with high research activity.Institution Profile The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education Its seven academic units and other related programs and institutes award master's and/or doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines. Enrollment is limited and classes are small. In 2018, the university also introduced its first online master's degree programs.  Academics  =Claremont Colleges= Among the contiguous CGU, Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, and undergraduate colleges (Pomona, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Scripps, and Pitzer), academic collaboration is highly valued. Cross-registration is free, and the members share libraries, health care, security, and other facilities. = Schools =  Arts & Humanities  The School of Arts and Humanities includes departments in the fields of Art, Arts Management, Religion, Music, English, Cultural Studies, Archival Studies, Media Studies, History, and Applied Women's Studies. These subjects have an interest in interdisciplinary studies that provide disciplinary depth as well as cross-disciplinary flexibility. The Institute for Antiquity & Christianity, which houses the School of Arts and Humanities and the Department of Religion In the Department of Religion, students can earn a degree with a focus in Mormon Studies, Catholicism, Islamic Studies, History of Christianity, Hebrew Bible, Indic Studies, Coptic Studies, Zoroastrianism; additional programs include Women's Studies in Religion, Religion and American Politics, Ethics and Culture, and Philosophy of Religion and Theology.

SSSPE offers the first Ph.D. and M.A. concentrations in the Western United States focused on the Science of Positive Psychology.. The program also offers the first Ph.D. degree in neuroeconomics which bridges economics, psychology, and public policy.  Community & Global Health  Formed in 2008, the School of Community and Global Health is dedicated to generating scientific knowledge about the causes and prevention of disease and the improvement of health and well-being of diverse populations locally and globally. The school is responsible for training professional practitioners to translate prevention science into improved practice and policy for health promotion and disease prevention at the individual, community and global levels. The school offers a Ph.D. in Health Promotion Sciences, DrPh., M.P.H. degrees; the M.P.H. program, which has a variety of concentrations, is fully accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health.

Pondus is a comic strip created by the Norwegian cartoonist Frode √òverli. Since its start in 1995, it has become one of the most successful comic strips in Scandinavia. It has been translated to several languages, including Danish, English, German, Finnish, French, Icelandic, Latin, Sami, Swedish and Esperanto. In 2000 it inspired its own magazine. Publication history √òverli initially developed a strip titled A-laget (A-team) in 1995, prior to leaving the magazine Pyton. This early version focused on three characters who were fanatical football-supporters. By the time the strip in its earliest form was first published in a small local newspaper Vest-Nytt of Sotra on October 28, 1995, it had taken the name Pondus.pdf In 1996 it began a four-year run as a supporting strip in the Norwegian magazine devoted to Bud Grace's Ernie, leading to its breakthrough on April 2, 1997, when it was taken on as a daily strip in national distribution newspaper Dagbladet. On July 4, 2000, it began publication in its own Pondus magazine, as the first Norwegian strip to ever carry its own monthly publication. This was followed on June 6, 2001 with the launch of a Swedish sister magazine. The strip runs daily in more than 80 Norwegian newspapers, and is syndicated to several international publications, most notably Swedish Dagens Nyheter, Danish Berlingske Tidende, and Icelandic Frettabladid. As of 2007's first issue, Pondus magazine left publisher Schibsted to continue its run with publisher Egmont. In a simultaneous event, the character Pondus quit his job as a bus driver, and bought a pub.

Authority The ULSU is not a university department; it is an independent organization, established in 1967 by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, of Alberta. It reports to the provincial government rather than university administration. The ULSU receives authority to conduct business through the Post-Secondary Learning Act of Alberta(PSLA). The Act establishes all student associations in Alberta as a corporation, whose members are the students of the public post-secondary institution. The PSLA allows student associations to administer student affairs, promote general student welfare, create governing documents, acquire property, and maintain the organization through the levy of mandatory fees. Representation Federally, the University of Lethbridge Students' Union participates in the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations, and provincially, they are a member of the Council of Alberta University Students. Council members sit on the Social Housing and Action Committee and the Plan-Your-City Advisory Committee through the City of Lethbridge.

The type species within the genus Ulva is Ulva lactuca, lactuca being Latin for \\"lettuce\\". The genus also includes the species previously classified under the genus Enteromorpha, the former members of which are known under the common name green nori. Description Individual blades of Ulva can grow to be more than 400 mm (16 in) in size, but this occurs only when the plants are growing in sheltered areas. A macroscopic alga which is light to dark green in colour, it is attached by disc holdfast.Burrows, E.M. 1991. Seaweeds of the British Isles. Volume 2 Chlorophyta. Natural History Museum, Nutrition and contamination Sea lettuce is eaten by a number of different sea animals, including manatees and the sea slugs known as sea hares. Many species of sea lettuce are a food source for humans in Scandinavia, Great Britain, Ireland, China, and Japan (where this food is known as aosa). Sea lettuce as a food for humans is eaten raw in salads and cooked in soups. It is high in protein, soluble dietary fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals, especially iron. However, contamination with toxic heavy metals at certain sites where it can be collected makes it dangerous for human consumption. Aquarium trade Sea lettuce species are commonly found in the saltwater aquarium trade, where the plants are valued for their high nutrient uptake and edibility. Many reef aquarium keepers use sea lettuce species in refugia or grow it as a food source for herbivorous fish. Sea lettuce is very easy to keep, tolerating a wide range of lighting and temperature conditions. In the refugium, sea lettuce can be attached to live rock or another surface, or simply left to drift in the water. Health concerns In August 2009, unprecedented amounts of these algae washed up on the beaches of Brittany, France, causing a major public health scare as it decomposed. The rotting leaves produced large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. In one incident near Saint- Michel-en-Gr√®ve, a horse rider lost consciousness and his horse died after breathing the seaweed fumes; in another, a lorry driver driving a load of decomposing sea lettuce passed out, crashed, and died, with toxic fumes claimed to be the cause. Environmentalists blamed the phenomenon on excessive nitrogenous compounds washed out to sea from improper disposal of pig and poultry animal waste from industrial farms.

The title character of the film, played by Nobuko Miyamoto, is a tax investigator for the Japanese National Tax Agency who employs various techniques to catch tax evaders. The director reportedly was inspired to make the film after he entered a much higher tax bracket after his success with The Funeral. A sequel, A Taxing Woman 2, featuring some of the same characters but darker in tone, was released in 1988. Plot A female tax auditor, Ry≈çko Itakura, inspects the accounts of various Japanese companies, uncovering hidden incomes and recovering unpaid taxes. One day she persuades her boss to let her investigate the owner of a string of love hotels who seems to be avoiding tax, but after an investigation no evidence is found. During the investigation the inspector and the inspected owner, Hideki Gond≈ç, develop an unspoken respect for each other. She is promoted to the post of government tax inspector. When the same case reappears she is again allowed to investigate. During a sophisticated series of raids against the hotel owner's interests, she accidentally comes across a hidden room containing vital incriminating evidence. On the same day, she helps Gond≈ç with his relationship with his teenage son. While she is doing all of this, she is neglecting her own son at home, calling him from her office at night and saying, \\"You can heat up your own dumplings in the microwave! You are big now! You are five!\\" Six months later the two meet again. The man is tired after daily interrogations. She tries to persuade him to surrender his last secrets for the sake of his son. After she declines an offer to live with him, he cuts his finger and writes the name of the secret bank account in blood on a handkerchief of hers that he saved from the first time she investigated him.

Lewites was born in the San Felipe barrio of Jinotepe, the son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland. He joined the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship in 1958 and went into exile in Brazil in 1960. Herty's brother, Israel Lewites, died in the attack on the Masaya barracks in October 1977 by the Tercerista Sandinista Front. Instead of fighting, Herty was apparently involved in financial matters and arms smuggling for the revolutionary movement. During the period of Sandinista rule in the 1980s, Lewites was an ally of the powerful Ortega brothers. As Minister of Tourism, he promoted state development projects, such as the Montelimar beach resort in 1986 and the Olof Palme Convention Center in Managua. After leaving government, he built the \\"Hertylandia\\" private amusement park. Lewites was elected to Congress on the FSLN ticket in 1990, the year Daniel Ortega lost the presidency. He aligned himself with Sergio Ram√≠rez's Sandinista Renewal Movement (Movimiento Renovador Sandinista or \\"MRS\\") against the faction of Secretary General Ortega in 1994. He ran for mayor of Managua, the capital, in 1996 on his own \\"Sol\\" ticket, splitting the Sandinista vote to throw the election to the Liberal candidate. With the support of the FSLN \\"Business Bloc\\" led by Bayardo Arce, Lewites rejoined the mainline FSLN in 1998 and, with Ortega's blessing, won the Managua mayorship as a Sandinista in 2000. Lewites opened Nicaragua's only amusement park, Hertylandia (named after himself), between Jinotepe and San Marcos. Following Ortega's third successive election defeat in 2001, Lewites advocated FSLN cooperation with President Enrique Bola√±os in his struggle to hold ex-President Arnoldo Alem√°n accountable for corruption. Ortega, however, eventually concluded a pact with Alem√°n. Meanwhile, Lewites removed corrupt members of the Ortega and Arce factions from positions in the Managua municipality. By appealing to both leftists and rightists fed-up with corruption, Lewites was for a while the most popular politician in Nicaragua and attracted the support of many historically prominent Sandinistas. He attempted to challenge Daniel Ortega for the 2006 FSLN presidential nomination, but was expelled from the FSLN (Sandinista Party) in February 2005. Lewites joined forces with the dissident MRS Party as their Presidential candidate for the 2006 election. He chose Edmundo Jarqu√≠n as his running mate for the vice presidency. On July 2, 2006, it was reported that Lewites died of a massive heart attack at the Hospital Metropolitano \\"Vivian Pellas\\" in Managua, aged 66, four months prior to the 2006 national elections. Some of Lewites supporters suspected he was poisoned by Ortega. His wife did not ask the doctor for autopsy to identify the cause of his death and later remained silent to the press. Lewites was polling in third place before dying, trailing very closely behind Ortega and Eduardo Montealegre. He was buried in his native city of Jinotepe three days after he died. His burial counted with the presence of: the president of the republic, cabinet members, diplomatic representatives, artists, politicians and entrepreneurs. It is calculated that more than 20,000 people were in attendance in the small cemetery of Jinotepe.

The circumstances of his death became a matter of dispute because, at the time he died, Duggan was attending a youth \\"cadre\\" school organised by the LaRouche movement, an international network led by the American political activist Lyndon LaRouche. The German police concluded that Duggan had committed suicide after running several kilometres from the apartment in which he had been staying, then jumping in front of early-morning traffic. A British coroner rejected a suicide verdict in 2003 after hearing the London Metropolitan Police describe the LaRouche movement as a political cult. Duggan telephoned his mother, Erica Duggan, 50 minutes before he died, apparently distressed about his involvement in it.Muir, Hugh. \\"Mystery death of anti-war student\\", The Guardian, 12 July 2003.Kirby, Terry. \\"Coroner denounces cult suicide claim\\", The Independent, 4 November 2003.Muir, Hugh. \\"British student did not commit suicide, says coroner\\", The Guardian, 5 November 2003. Arguing that the German police had not investigated the case thoroughly, Erica Duggan commissioned forensic reports which suggested the car accident might have been staged and that Duggan had died elsewhere. After protracted litigation in the UK and Germany, the High Court in London ordered a second inquest in 2010,\\"Fresh inquest into student death\\", BBC News, 20 May 2010. and in 2012 the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court ordered the Wiesbaden police to reopen their investigation. In 2015 the coroner upheld that Duggan had been killed in the accident, but rejected a suicide verdict, adding that unexplained injuries suggested an \\"altercation at some stage before his death.\\"Taylor, Matthew. \\"Jeremiah Duggan's death not a suicide, British coroner rules\\", The Guardian, 21 May 2015.Barfield, Tom. \\"Family's ten-year quest for truth about dead son\\", The Local, 22 May 2015. The LaRouche movement attributed criticism of its involvement in the case to LaRouche's political opponents, including former British prime minister Tony Blair and former U.S. vice president Dick Cheney, who they say sought to discredit LaRouche over his opposition to the 2003 Iraq War and his criticism of the anthropogenic global-warming theory.Samuels, Tim.

Duggan's parents divorced when he was seven. Duggan attended Fitzjohn's Primary School in Hampstead, Quainton School for Boys, and won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital school in Sussex as a boarder. After his A-levels, he spent time in India, then trained in Israel as a youth leader.Kirby, Terry. \\"The lost boy\\", The Independent, 28 August 2003.

Duggan's mother said he became interested in politics after 9/11; his strong opposition to the Iraq War led him to become involved with the LaRouche movement.Taylor, Jerome. \\"Mystery of dead Briton and the right-wing cult\\", The Independent, 27 February 2010. =LaRouche movement= alt=photograph Lyndon LaRouche and his German wife, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, ran a global political network of publications, committees and a youth cadre, based in Leesburg, Virginia, in the United States, and in Wiesbaden, Germany. The movement in Germany is represented by the Schiller Institute and the B√ºrgerrechtsbewegung Solidarit√§t party. LaRouche stood as a presidential candidate in the US eight times between 1976 and 2004.Tarr, Dave; Benenson, Bob. Elections A to Z, CQ Press, 2012, 303‚Äì304. He was jailed in 1989 for conspiracy to commit fraud, a prosecution he said was politically motivated.\\"Debtor's Prison: Lyndon LaRouche\\", Time magazine, 6 February 1989.\\"LaRouche Is Released And Plans Campaign\\", The New York Times, 27 January 1994. From the 1970s the movement became associated with the promotion of conspiracy theories, and at times with the use of violence against opponents, the fraudulent use of donations, and antisemitism.Ciment, Jim. \\"Lyndon LaRouche,\\" in Peter Knight (ed.), Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2003, 423‚Äì424.Minz, John. \\"Ideological Odyssey: From Old Left to Far Right\\", The Washington Post, 14 January 1985. There was criticism of its recruitment methods. According to The Sunday Times, recruits were isolated from their families, encouraged to give up their studies, and subjected to intense verbal pressure before being asked to accept the LaRouche worldview.Smith, David James. \\"Motorway madness\\", The Sunday Times, 18 July 2004. Archived at the (Internet Archive). Members said the allegations were misrepresentations, and LaRouche strongly denied the charge of antisemitism.LaRouche, Lyndon H. Jr. \\"On The Press Hoax Against the Pope: Britain's Bernard Lewis & His Crimes,\\" LaRouche Political Action Committee, 17 September 2006. Archived at the Internet Archive. LaRouche was particularly critical of Britain and of the Tavistock Institute in London, a psychotherapy and social sciences charity that the movement associated with British intelligence.Kirby, Terry. \\"The cult and the candidate\\", The Independent, 21 July 2004. In 1999 a LaRouche publication said Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was threatening to assassinate LaRouche, probably with backing from the British royal family.Burdman, Mark. \\"British Magazine Publishes Death Threat vs. LaRouche\\", Executive Intelligence Review, 13 August 1999. Duggan's family came to believe that this worldview affected the movement's perception of Duggan, when the conference participants learned that he was a British Jew who, as a child, had attended the Tavistock Clinic for counselling when his parents divorced. Duggan's involvement with the movement = Nouvelle Solidarit√© = Invalides station on the Paris M√©tro. Duggan's first contact with the LaRouche movement was in Paris in January 2003, when he bought a copy of the LaRouche French-language newspaper, Nouvelle Solidarit√©, from a booth near the British Institute, outside the Invalides station on the Paris M√©tro. The man who sold him the paper was Benoit Chalifoux, a writer for the newspaper and one of the movement's \\"organizers\\" or recruiters. Duggan was intensely opposed to the Iraq War, as were Chalifoux and his group of friends from the movement.Louise Osmond, \\"Lost Abroad: The Parents' Story,\\" Cutting Edge, Channel 4, 1 April 2010, 2/5, 00:01:28 (1/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5). Protests were taking place all over the world in the weeks leading up to the invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003. Duggan began seeing more of Chalifoux's group and was invited to attend a Schiller Institute conference near Wiesbaden, the LaRouche movement's European headquarters.Channel 4 Cutting Edge, 1 April 2010, 2/5, 00:05:40‚Äì00:07:10. Duggan and his parents believed it was an anti- war conference. His mother searched for material about LaRouche on the web in vain; possibly she or her son misspelled the name as \\"Laroche.\\" =Conference= Duggan and Chalifoux travelled to Wiesbaden on 21 March with eight other men. Duggan stayed in a youth hostel at first, then with two other recruits in an apartment belonging to two Schiller Institute managers. The conference, \\"How to Reconstruct a Bankrupt World,\\" was held in Bad Schwalbach, near Wiesbaden, from 21 to 23 March. LaRouche was the keynote speaker, with a speech entitled \\"Physical Geometry as Strategy.\\" According to April Witt in The Washington Post, he told the audience that George W. Bush was an unreformed drunk (he‚Äôs a teetotaler), Woodrow Wilson had founded the Ku Klux Klan from the White House, John F. Kennedy was killed by a domestic American operation, and the US was using the war in Iraq to \\"ignite catastrophic global warfare.\\" The plot to launch a world war was being influenced, he said, by people who \\"like Hitler, admire Nietzsche, but being Jewish ... couldn't qualify for Nazi Party leadership, even though their fascism was absolutely pure! As extreme as Hitler! They sent them to the United States.\\" The people behind the plot were the \\"independent central-banking-system crowd, the slime- mold,\\" he said, the same people who had brought Hitler to power in the 1930s.Witt, April. \\"No Joke,\\" Washington Post Magazine, 24 October 2004, 12‚Äì17, 36‚Äì42. Archived at WebCite. =Youth cadre school= After the conference, Duggan attended a LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden with 60‚Äì70 others. Chalifoux, the recruiter who had accompanied him to Germany, returned to Paris. According to another potential recruit, there were hours of lectures, seminars and one-on-one meetings every day, as well as chanting and singing.Taylor, Matthew. \\"Student Jeremiah Duggan feared he was in trouble before 'suicide', says mother\\", The Guardian, 20 May 2015. Duggan reportedly stood out because he was British and Jewish. A document from the London Metropolitan Police, submitted to the first inquest, said the Schiller Institute and LaRouche Youth Movement blamed the Jewish people for the Iraq war and other global issues, and that \\"Jeremiah's lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology.\\"BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, 3/3, 00:02:23. According to Duggan's mother, the Schiller Institute's scientific adviser, Dr. Jonathan Tennenbaum, told her that when Duggan heard the Jews being blamed for the war during a seminar, he had stood up and said, \\"But I'm a Jew!\\" One participant said the others put him \\"through the wringer\\" because of it. Nordhausen, Frank. \\"Ermittlungen einer Mutter: Der mysteri√∂se Todesfall Jeremiah Duggon\\", Berliner Zeitung, 4 April 2007. According to Witt, Duggan may have been placed under further pressure because he told the others he had attended the Tavistock Clinic as a child for counselling when his parents divorced. Duggan's conference notes showed that someone at the conference referred to the Tavistock as a \\"brainwashing\\" centre. Incident =Visit to Frankfurt= St√§del museum, Frankfurt Duggan and his French girlfriend had planned to meet in Paris on Tuesday, 25 March. Instead he called her that day, two days before his death, to say he had no money for the fare home and was unable to get a ride until Sunday. He told her \\"very serious things\\" were happening and that he would explain when he returned. On 26 March he accompanied LaRouche members to Frankfurt to hand out LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the Rembrandt collection at the St√§del museum. When one member asked what he thought of it, he started crying. The woman invited him to step outside for some air. He kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche, and said he wanted to go back to England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30 pm.Channel 4 Cutting Edge, 1 April 2010, 3/5, 00:06:25. =Duggan's telephone calls= One of the Schiller Institute managers in whose apartment Duggan was staying told The Sunday Times that he and his roommate got back to the house around midnight. They had no key so the manager opened the door for them. According to the roommate (speaking after Duggan's death to Duggan's girlfriend), Duggan could not sleep and kept switching the lights on and off. He said he was unable to trust LaRouche and felt trapped. At around 4:20 am‚Äîby now Thursday, 27 March‚ÄîDuggan called his girlfriend on the roommate's mobile phone. She said he was speaking very quietly, sounded agitated and confused, complaining that he no longer knew what was true and real, and that someone was conducting experiments with computers and magnetic waves, perhaps on him. She asked him to take a train to Paris in the morning.BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, 1/3, 00:05:10; 2/3, 00:00:00 mins. According to the roommate, Duggan then telephoned his mother, after which he ran out of the house. Mrs. Duggan said the first call came at 5:24 am German time (4:24 am in the UK): > And he said, \\"Mum, I'm in ... big trouble ... You know this Nouvelle > Solidarit√©?\\" ... He said, \\"I can't do this ... I want out.\\" And at that > point the phone was cut. And then it rang back again almost immediately. And > the first thing that he said that time was, \\"Mum, I'm frightened.\\" I > realised he was in such danger that I said to him, \\"I love you.\\" And then he > said, \\"I want to see you now.\\" ... I said, \\"Well, where are you, Jerry?\\" He > said, \\"Wiesbaden.\\" And I said, \\"How do you spell it?\\" And he said, \\"W-I- > E-S.\\" And then the phone was cut.BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, 2/3, > 00:02:08.

After the calls, according to the roommate, Duggan asked, \\"Why did you choose me?\\" and said he wanted to go out for a cigarette. The roommate went too but pressed a doorbell by accident while looking for the light switch at the bottom of the stairs; he said this appeared to make Duggan panic and he ran off. He said he ran after Duggan briefly before going back to the apartment. =Death= Just over thirty minutes later, at about 6:00 am, two drivers heading into Wiesbaden town centre saw a man run toward them on the Berliner Stra√üe (Bundesstra√üe 455), a four-lane dual carriageway. The spot, near an Aral garage, was around five kilometres (c. three miles) from the apartment in which Duggan had been staying, and not far from the LaRouche offices in the Wiesbaden suburb of Erbenheim.BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, from 00:01:38. One of the drivers said Duggan ran toward him with outstretched arms. The car, a BMW, clipped him with the wing mirror. He appears to have fallen, but got up and continued running toward the traffic that was heading into town. Both drivers reported the incidents to police. At 6:14 am, as the police were taking details, they were told that a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the passenger door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Volkswagen Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35 am. The view of the German police was that Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5 km from the apartment. Duggan's family complained that the police had failed to establish that. Other allegations included that he had spent the night at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road, and that he had run onto the road from a car. Lorscheid, Helmut. \\"Tod auf der Schnellstra√üe\\", Heise Online, 14 November 2003. Forensic reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the coroner rejected in 2015. =Early response= Within minutes of Duggan's second telephone call to her, Erica contacted the British emergency services and was advised to call her local police station in Colindale, Barnet. She told them she believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard, but when she explained he had become involved with Nouvelle Solidarit√© they had no idea what she meant. At 7:40 am Duggan's roommate telephoned his girlfriend in Paris to ask if she had heard from him; he said Duggan had left the apartment and had not returned. At around 11 am Erica rang the roommate's mobile phone; because he did not speak English, he passed it to a Schiller Institute manager. The manager reportedly told her the group was a news agency, adding, \\"We cannot take responsibility for the actions of individuals. We think your son has psychological problems.\\" She said she would call the local hospitals to see whether Duggan had been admitted. Shortly after this, the manager and Duggan's roommate, along with another member, handed his passport, bag and rucksack to the Wiesbaden police station.Foggo, Daniel. \\"German police probe into British student's death was 'inadequate'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 9 November 2003. The manager told The Independent: \\"I believed he had psychological problems, based on the conversations he had with people. I don't know what happened on the night he died, but the Schiller Institute played no part in his death.\\" The police report stated that the manager told them Erica had called \\"since he had severe asthma and was not getting in touch with her.\\" Later Erica said her son had not had asthma since childhood. According to one of those present, around 25 members of the movement were asked to assemble in the local LaRouche office that morning, in a meeting attended by Helga Zepp- LaRouche. They were told that Duggan had killed himself. A LaRouche recruiter from Paris told the meeting that Duggan had been to the Tavistock, apparently giving the impression that he had been there recently. Zepp-LaRouche reportedly said that Duggan might have been sent from London to harm LaRouche. Inquiries =First German investigation= Wiesbaden police reportedly concluded within three hours that Duggan committed suicide. LaRouche officials were said to have told police that Duggan had been a patient at the Tavistock and had suffered from \\"suicidal impulses.\\" That view of him shaped the rest of the inquiry, according to The Sunday Times. An emergency doctor gave the cause of death as \\"open, cranio-cerebral trauma following traffic accident,\\" injuries that he said were consistent with the accident as described by the drivers. Degen, Wolfgang. \\"Wiesbaden: Faszination Verschw√∂rung ‚Äì Seit zw√∂lf Jahren bietet Unfalltod eines britischen Studenten Anlass zu Spekulationen\\" , Wiesbadener Kurier, 13 June 2015. The accident investigator noted marks on Duggan's clothes consistent with having been in contact with the underside of a vehicle. The braking had left marks on the road; Duggan was lying about 23 metres beyond the point of impact. The investigator took 79 photographs of the scene, although the cars were moved before he arrived. The Germans did not conduct an autopsy, because the cause of death had been established and there was no evidence of foul play. His clothes were not returned to his family and were assumed to have been destroyed. The police took no formal witness statements. Witness evidence was recorded as \\"brief, sometimes contradictory, notes,\\" according to The Daily Telegraph. Nothing suggested that the drivers had any connection to the LaRouche movement or Duggan. The prosecutor closed the case after three months. In 2004 Dieter Arlett, the Wiesbaden public prosecutor, told the BBC: > We are 100 percent certain that it is suicide, suicide as we call it, that > as a consequence of his own behaviour, and with no one else involved, he > threw himself in front of a car, of several cars, and died on the third > attempt.BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, 2/3, 00:02:37. Under German law, Arlett said that he could investigate further only if there existed \\"concrete evidence of third-party involvement,\\" and there was none; the Schiller Institute had been mentioned in connection with the death only because Duggan had attended an event of theirs.BBC Newsnight, 12 February 2004, 3/3, 00:04:16. Officials maintained the same position in 2007 and 2009.

Archived at WebCite. A blood sample showed no drugs or alcohol. Shove was not called to attend the inquest, which took place in November 2003. Robert Hawthorne, an accident investigator, told the court that Duggan may only have appeared to leap in front of the cars: \\"The drivers may have perceived that he leapt when in actual fact he was either running to clear the cars or what they saw was the post-impact movement of Jeremiah as he was flung around.\\" The court heard testimony about the conference Duggan had attended. A Metropolitan Police memo was entered as evidence: \\"The Schiller Institute and the LaRouche Youth Movement ... blames the Jewish people for the Iraq war and all the other problems in the world. Jeremiah's lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology.\\" The coroner, Dr. William Dolman, delivered a narrative verdict: > Jeremiah Joseph Duggan received fatal head injuries when he ran into the > road in Wiesbaden and was hit by two private motor cars. What other fact do > we know that I must add? I really must add that he had earlier been in a > state of terror.

In 2005 she hand-delivered a list of questions to Shove, the pathologist who had performed the autopsy. When she showed him Duggan's autopsy report, he allegedly replied that Duggan had been \\"severely beaten around the head\\" and said he had not realised it had been a traffic accident. Shove declined to sign a statement to that effect and apparently could not be located for the second inquest. Six forensic experts hired by Erica examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden.Townsend, Mark; Doward, Jamie. \\"New evidence shows 'suicide' student was beaten to death\\", The Observer, 25 March 2007.\\"Student beaten to death\\", BBC News, 27 March 2007.Taylor, Matthew. \\"Germany 'suicide' student may have been chased and beaten, inquest told\\", The Guardian, 20 May 2015. A forensic pathologist suggested that bruises on Duggan's hands and arms were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan Police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or a similar instrument, while Canning wrote that he found nothing to suggest that the cars had made contact with Duggan.Townsend, Mark. \\"Cult riddle of student's death\\", The Observer, 17 September 2006. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views. Those views were challenged during a High Court hearing in 2008 regarding the application for a new inquest. Contrary to the claim that there was no sign that Duggan had come into contact with the cars, there were \\"traces on the underside of the Golf,\\" according to Cecilia Ivimy on behalf of the Attorney General. She described the argument that the accident had been staged as requiring someone to have inflicted head injuries after the phone call to Erica, placed Duggan on the road, inflicted damage to two cars, scattered debris, and created skid marks, all without attracting attention. In 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany called the allegations outlandish. The Wiesbadener Kurier criticised what it saw as the defamation of \\"two completely innocent motorists.\\" =Second British inquest= North London Coroner's Court, Barnet Relying on the forensic reviews, Erica applied in May 2007 for a new inquest.

Exhibition drill is a variant of drill that involves complex marching sequences which usually deviate from drill used in the course of ordinary parades. Teams performing exhibition drill are often affiliated with military units, but the scope of exhibition drill is not limited to military drill teams. Exhibition drill is often performed by Armed Forces Precision Drill Teams, the drill teams at service academies and ROTC and JROTC units, and civilian drill teams that perform at parades, drill meets, and half-time shows and other public venues. History of rifle exhibition drill A rifle drill team performance at the United States Naval Academy The first documented performance of exhibition drill was performed by Hadji Cheriff and filmed at what is believed to be the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The film was later copyrighted by Thomas Edison in 1899, entitled The Arabian Gun Twirler. The performance demonstrates aerial (two ) and over-the-shoulder techniques, and It is believed that the weapon was a .577 caliber, triple band 1853 Enfield Musket, which is 56\\" long and weighs about 9.5 pounds and thus is 13\\" longer and heavier than most drill weapons used today.  Exhibition drill in competition  Exhibition drill is one of many different drill phases that are a part of a drill meet. Other phases include Inspection, Color Guard and Regulation Drill. Exhibition military drill has grown drastically in popularity in recent decades. This growth can be attributed to several primary factors. These include: * The expansion of Junior ROTC programs through the four primary service branches that occurred in the early and mid 1980s took the total number of units from roughly 1,600 to well over 2,500 in the U.S. This provided more cadets the opportunity to be a part of these exhibition drill teams. * The work of Sports Network International (SNI) produced military drill and ceremony competitions on a scale that had never previously been seen. * From these numerous competitions,http://drill.thenationals.net SNI produced magazines and websites to feature this activity. SNI also produced training and entertainment videos http://videos.thenationals.net devoted exclusively to featuring many of the military exhibition drill teams in the country. These videos allowed the talent and creativity involved in exhibition drill at the highest levels to travel and expand at a greater rate, helping to promote the sport. General rules and guidelines Rules of exhibition drill during competitions vary, but most of them apply the following guidelines: Time ‚Äì There is usually a minimum and maximum time a routine may take. Points are deducted if a team is under or over time. Boundaries ‚Äì Teams should be aware of their boundary lines, and if necessary, alter their routines as to not cross the boundary lines. Points are deducted if a person crosses a boundary line. Some high-school level competitions prevent cadets who are participating in armed drill events from performing more dangerous 'over the head' spins, or raising cadets off the floor, in the interest of safety. =High school= Some high school drill teams compete at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida, and generally use demilitarized Springfield M1903s, M1 Garands, M-14 rifles and Daisy Drill Rifles. There are also national drill level competitions for JROTC divisions, including Navy JROTC, Army JROTC, Marine Corps JROTC, and Air Force JROTC. Other countries have their own drill team competitions for teenagers. =Unarmed= In an unarmed division, exhibition drill may consist of intricate precision marching, along with various hand movements. Modified step team routines are used in some competitions. College ROTC drill teams Colleges with Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) units, as well as military academies, have drill teams normally train and compete in two types of drill events: Regulation/Close Order and Exhibition (Trick or Fancy) Drill. Regulation Drill is conducted in accordance with Field Manual 22-5 (now FM 3-21.5) Drill and Ceremonies. Exhibition Drill is more free form and often more elaborate then Regulation Drill. Exhibition Drill teams are also more colorful in uniform and weaponry. In both types of event, participants are typically armed with weapons made safe or inert by removal of firing pins. Armament is totally devoid of all firing mechanisms for the safety of participants and audience alike. Pershing Rifles, founded in 1894, is the oldest continuously operating college organization dedicated to military drill. The original drill team created by John J. Pershing had a simple goal: to serve as an example for the cadets at the University of Nebraska, who were sorely lacking in esprit de corps, motivation, and basic military skills. For its first few years, the group (then called \\"Company A\\") did just that: its members became experts at unarmed, armed, and exhibition drill, and were soon the pride of the university. By 1894, cadets and alumni formed Varsity Rifles. By June 1895, when Pershing announced his departure from the university, the group had morphed from a simple drill team into a fraternal organization; in his honor, they renamed the group the Pershing Rifles. As the unit grew, their reputation followed: by the early 1900s, membership was considered a high military honor. Other schools soon applied for affiliation with the Pershing Rifles. By the middle of the 20th century, this now national organization comprised nearly 200 units representing all of the services stationed at ROTC detachments around the country. Through their phenomenal growth, however, the Pershing Rifles were careful to stay true to their basic purpose: to develop the traits of leadership and discipline among their members through drill competition. The success of Pershing Rifles' leadership development program would not have been possible without the organization's focus on close-order and exhibition rifle drill. Excellence in drill, whether armed or unarmed, is a function of discipline and dedication; these traits are put to work on a regular basis by Pershing Rifles units. A typical unit performs as a color guard, exhibition drill team, honor guard, funeral detail, or any other ceremonial unit requested; these services are usually at the request of the local ROTC detachment or school, but are sometimes requested by alumni, local governments, or active duty military units. Through all of these activities, in addition to the skills gained by the performers, positive publicity is also received by the unit's host school, host ROTC detachment, and ultimately the military in general. Pershing Rifles hosts a National Drill Competition each spring which attracts some of the finest college level drill teams in the nation. Triphibian Guard was founded in 1959 as an Army ROTC Drill Team of Seton Hall University as a chartered and approved student organization. Cadets from the existing Pershing Rifles Company K-8 formed the Triphibian Guard. The name was chosen because it represented land, sea and air forces. Once established, the Triphibian Guard quickly grew in stature and respect at the university, becoming the official honor guard of the university president. Officer candidate student members wore a distinctive triangular patch and fourragere (gold and black cord) on the left shoulder of their uniform. This was the United States Army's colors, and depicted an African male lion with a gold crown on the forehead. Upon graduation, student officer graduates are eligible for the award of Distinguished Military Graduate (DMG), one of the awards and decorations of the United States military, and may become a commissioned officer of the United States Armed Forces. The unit disbanded in the late 1970s due to lack of student interest at the end of the hostilities of the Vietnam War. Gator Guard Drill Team (GGDT) is a precision drill team and military fraternity based at the University of Florida. It is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida. Founded in 1953, the Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida's Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The Gator Guard performs annually at the university's Homecoming Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid- City and King Rex parades at the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The team uses M1903 rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances. The Gator Guard also performs color guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the SEC, and the MLB. Billy Mitchell Drill Team (BMDT), founded in 1951 as an Air Force ROTC Drill Team, is a drill, ceremony and color guard team at the University of Florida. It is open to all students of the university, but wears the United States Air Force uniform. With a history spanning six decades, BMDT's rich heritage and dedication to discipline and excellence help to produce officers for the nation's Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Noteable Civilian Drill Teams King's Village Guard of Hawaii is more commonly known as the King's Guard. They were founded in the 1960s and perform weekly shows in Hawaii. They have also performed several times at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona, Florida. They use a modified Springfield M1903 rifle. New Guard America was founded in 1997 by Constantine H. Wilson. This is the world's only internationally touring civilian drill team. They use Springfield M1903 rifles with fixed bayonets. They are based out of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. They perform mainly in four man-blocks. In June 2008 they performed at the Norwegian Military Tattoohttp://www.normiltatto.no/ in Oslo, Norway, making them the first civilian drill team to perform at an international tattoo. Hawaii Royal Honor Guard, formerly the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards, was established in 1989 by Commander Adam Marumoto and is currently under the direction of Executive Officer Christopher Koanui. It was originally intended to perform for the Hilton Hawaiian Villages events and shows on the property, as well as elsewhere. As of 2009 the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards adopted their new title as the Hawaii Royal Honor Guard, and now perform at private events for various clients. The HRHG'S members have numerous championship titles which range from the national championships and the Isis world championships beginning in 1989. The HRHG currently perform private shows at the Historic Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They contribute to Hawaii's tradition of training youth and young adults in the art of one of Hawaii's unique styles of exhibition drill.

It is Canada's second largest student union and the third largest in North America. History The student government evolved from the University of Toronto Union, which was founded in 1901. This was replaced by the Parliament of the Undergraduates in 1907. The Parliament suffered from low attendance from its elected members, especially representatives of the medical school. As the years progressed its Executive shouldered much of the work. In 1913, the parliament was replaced by a Students' Administrative Council composed of solely male students. The Women's Students' Administrative Council was formed in 1916, and in 1919 the two councils formed a Joint Executive. In 1931 the separate councils were abolished and the Joint Executive became the main body, and during 1935-1936 the unwieldy name \\"Joint Executive Students' Administrative Council\\" was simplified to \\"Students' Administrative Council\\". At an annual general meeting on 16 November 2006 University of Toronto students voted to change the name to University of Toronto Students' Union. The mandate of UTSU until 1971 can be found in section 34 of the University of Toronto Act, 1947. SAC's original offices were located in Hart House, but are today based in the Louis B. Stewart Observatory at the centre of Hart House Circle, just south of the Hart House building itself. The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory, also known as Louis B. Stewart Observatory Governance The Union is governed by a Board of Directors which includes elected representatives from each of the schools' federated and constituent colleges and professional faculties. The number of directors from each division is proportional to the population of that college or faculty. Much of the Board of Directors' responsibilities are delegated to committees: Equity and Accessibility, Campaigns and Outreach, Clubs, Elections and Referenda, Finance, Governance, Services, Student Aid, and the Executive Committee. The committees are made up of members of the Board of Directors, and deal with specific issues of operations, services, and campaigns. Committee work is then presented to the full Board of Directors for approval. Full-time undergraduate students at the St. George campus can apply for UTSU funding for grassroots-based advocacy initiatives on campus, under the UTSU's Campus Initiatives Policy. =Federated structure= In April 2013, students of the Engineering Society (EngSoc), one of the UTSU federated bodies, voted to separate from UTSU following several years of tension between EngSoc and UTSU. After several years of negotiations, UTSU and EngSoc came to an agreement where UTSU recognised EngSoc as the main student government for engineering students, ensured that EngSoc would receive half of all UTSU levies and put EngSoc as the primary provider of student services to engineering students. EngSoc agreed not to defederate in return. Elections Voter turnout in UTSU elections has been very low for several years. Recently, turnouts began reaching as high as the 15% mark, but dropped back down to 6% following the controversy surrounding the 2010 elections. The 2020 elections saw a voter turnout of 12.7%, a significant increase over the 4.2% turnout seen in the 2019 elections. Services The UTSU provides a variety of student services, including cheap in-office printing, the UTSU Food Bank, funding and resources for UTSU-recognized clubs, and a Student Aid Program with bursaries covering transit, accessibility-related costs, textbook costs, and more. UTSU also administers a Health and Dental Plan that provides health and dental insurance to UTSU members. Canadian Federation of Students affiliation In November 2002, UTSU members voted in favour of becoming members of the Canadian Federation of Students, with 65% of those who voted supporting this decision. In 2016, a movement called You Decide UofT launched a petition to hold a referendum on CFS membership. A few months later, 4 out of the 7 UTSU executives endorsed the campaign and called for an end to UTSU membership of the CFS. In the 2017 UTSU elections, the Demand Better slate, which had a policy of leaving the CFS, won most of the executive positions, including the presidency. Stances Flat Fees In 2009, the University of Toronto changed how they charged fees to students in the Faculty of Arts & Science. Instead of charging per-course fees, they started charging a flat fee ‚Äì meaning that students would have to pay for five courses ‚Äì even if they only took three. This amounted to a 66 per cent tuition fee increase for no service improvement. The UTSU had been opposing the flat fee structure since it was announced in 2009. Since the implementation of the program, students have found it difficult to have a part time job and do well in their studies, since they do not have the choice to reduce their course load under this tuition fee scheme. The flat fee scheme has also placed additional financial stresses onto students, worsening concerns about mental health. They launched a strong campaign over the last few years to address this issue. In addition to petitions and protests, we garnered support from alumni, who started a letter- writing campaign to oppose flat fees, we brought the issue to a provincial level through the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario, making it one of their main lobbying asks and educating students across the province to the unfair fee-collection model, some of whom did not know it was taking place at their school. In 2013 the UTSU ramped up our campaign, collecting more than 6000 postcard petitions from students asking the government to address the issue of flat fees and delivering them to the Brad Duguid, Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. In December 2013, the provincial government announced that new legislation would limit the amount of fees that universities can charge to students. Under the new policy, 100 per cent of tuition fees can only be charged if students are taking an 80 per cent course load or higher. This will reduce tuition fees for some students over $2300 per year. The changes will roll out over two years starting in fall 2015. Access copyright UTSU was a vocal opponent of the University's controversial license with Access Copyright, which has since not been renewed. Access Copyright claimed that the license would provide students with the ability to use copyrighted works without penalty ‚Äì a right already granted to students through the Copyright Act. Affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, students and researchers are permitted to use copyrighted works for educational purposes.

The earliest manifestations of this were in response to SAC's policy, established in 1926, of not interfering in political issues for fear this would impede campus unity. This policy extended to The Varsity (newspaper), which was published by SAC. In 1929 and 1931, SAC dismissed editors who published unpopular opinions. In the mid-1930s, SAC was criticized for failing to support efforts by anti-war and pro-peace advocates on campus, groups which SAC declared were of limited interest.Charles Levi \\"The SAC Historical Project 1930-1950\\", self-published, 1992, pp. 24-27 In 1946, SAC's decision not to endorse efforts to prevent deportation of Japanese Canadians was also the brunt of campus criticism.Levi, \\"SAC Historical Project\\", 209-216 Anti-racist advocates also derided SAC's inability to embrace this cause in the 1940s.Levi, \\"SAC Historical Project\\", 120-140 This criticism began to shift in the 1960s when the student council embarked on a more activist agenda. One of the more concrete manifestations of this was in 1972, when the Medical Society held a successful referendum calling for their withdrawal from SAC. Administrative hesitation was the only factor which prevented this withdrawal from becoming effective.C. Sajani, President, Medical Society to J.H. Sword, Acting President U of T, February 25, 1972 University of Toronto Archives [UTA], A78-0028/29; John Evans, President of U of T to Robin Ross, Registrar, October 12, 1972, in University of Toronto Archives A78-0028/64 Controversial public positions The UTSU has been criticized for having taken controversial public positions on equity and racial issues on campus, as well as having become involved in controversial campaigns relating to certain global issues like the Sri Lankan conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and federal issues like the Aboriginal movement Idle No More. Many criticisms have come from members of provincial and federal political parties, including both the Liberals and Conservatives (and their student arms), which have questioned the legitimacy of UTSU's democratic credentials. 2007 CFS campaign allegations The UTSU has also been criticized for its involvement with the Canadian Federation of Students, due to numerous reports of interference with student union elections at other schools in the Greater Toronto Area. Former S.A.C. Vice-President Sam Rahimi (2004-2005), has claimed that he was repeatedly asked to participate in election campaigns at Ryerson and York Universities, and that he and other student leaders from S.A.C. were bused in to these schools at election time to campaign on behalf of C.F.S. friendly slates R. Doolittle and D. Blain, 2007, Canadian University Press (originally published in The Eyeopener, 2007) The Canadian Federation of Students denies these claims. 2008 threats of legal action The UTSU has recently been involved in a number of scandals in which they have been accused of silencing students who disagree with the ideas of the union. In a recent referendum regarding the construction a Student Commons Building that was to be completely funded and run by students (as opposed to funded by private donations and run in part by the administration and by students ) the UTSU was accused of actively pursuing students who it felt were campaigning against the union. The then president of the union went so far as to threaten legal action against a student who was putting up posters questioning the UTSU's approach to the student commons. 2012 lecture protests A protest in November 2012 against guest lecturer Warren Farrell at an event organized by the Canadian Association for Equality garnered criticism after an estimated fifteen protesters blocked the entrance to the event and caused a delay in the lecture. One person was arrested at the event but was released with no charges. The UTSU organized the protest after the university administration denied their request to cancel the lecture. The protest was organized in response to controversial excerpts from Warren Farrell's publications and statements he made about incest in a 1977 Penthouse interview. One of the feminist protesters is recorded as repeatedly saying \\"You are fucking scum\\" to a male attendee. 2013 membership defederation In 2013, several major divisions of the UTSU's membership‚ÄîTrinity College, Victoria College, and the Engineering Society‚Äî held referenda proposing effective \\"defederation\\" from the Union by rerouting fees directly to their respective College or Faculty-based student societies, rather than paying the fees to the Union. All three divisions voted overwhelmingly in favour of fee diversion. 2015 election After a long history of incumbent election victories, in 2015, a non-incumbent opposition slate won all 5 of the executive seats and a large number of the board. Lawsuit against former executives and executive director On September 24, 2015, it was revealed that the UTSU had filed a statement of claim against the former president, former vice-president internal & services and the former executive director regarding the dismissal of the former executive director. The lawsuit has since been settled between the former president and former vice-president internal & services.

This may involve recovering a vehicle damaged in an accident, returning one to a drivable surface in a mishap or inclement weather, or towing or transporting one via flatbed to a repair shop or other location. A tow truck is distinct from a car carrier trailer, which is used to move multiple new or used vehicles simultaneously in routine transport operations. History A 1920 Chevrolet tow truck Ferdinand Porsche of Austro-Daimler developed an artillery tractor for the Austro-Hungarian army in 1908, the M 08. One of the batch was constructed as a recovery vehicle for the others, with a large winch on the rear platform. The wrecker (with lifting jib) was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes Sr. of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a garage worker who was inspired after he needed blocks, ropes, and six men to pull a car out of a creek. After improving his design he began manufacturing them commercially. The International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum in his home town displays restored antique wreckers, tools, equipment, and pictorial histories of the industry Holmes created.  Types of towing equipment  Boom truck with underlift Five general types of tow truck are in common usage, usually based on the type or size of vehicle to be towed: *Boom: use an adjustable boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. The heaviest types of boom can rotate, effectively turning the tow truck into a sort of mobile crane, called a \\"rotator\\", and are usually reserved for heavy vehicle accidents. In the past boom trucks used a \\"hook and chain\\" system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch. A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects the truck and vehicle, so it can be towed on its other axle. \\"Slings\\" and \\"belt lifts\\" are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have one or two of the front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain. Wheel-lift in stowed position * Wheel-lift (also called a \\"spectacle lift\\" or \\"underlift\\"): evolved from the hook and chain technology to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them, drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a pneumatic or hydraulic hoist so it can be towed. This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle (i.e. the front wheels if it is front wheel drive, the rear wheels if it is rear wheel drive) touching only the tires. The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W. Nelson of Weld Built Body Co. in 1967.. Retrieved 12 September 2016. The name spectacle lift is common in Europe; the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles (eyeglasses). Medium and heavy trucks use a variation, the \\"underlift\\" or \\"chassis lift\\", which lifts the axle or frame instead of the wheels. Wheel-lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis. * Integrated (also called a \\"Self Loader\\", \\"Snatcher\\", \\"Quick Pick\\" or \\"Repo Truck\\"): boom and wheel-lift integrated into one unit. Used in light duty trucks to repossess vehicles or move illegally parked vehicles. Most have controls for the apparatus inside the cab of the tow truck to make quick pickup possible without the inconvenience of exiting the truck to hook up the vehicle. Heavy duty trucks are also manufactured with integrated lift. Flatbed with wheel-lift *Flatbed (also called a \\"rollback\\", \\"slide\\" or \\"tilt tray\\"): the entire back of the truck is fitted with a bed that can be hydraulically inclined and slid back to ground level, allowing the vehicle to be placed on it under its own power or pulled on by a winch. Because they carry, rather than tow the vehicle, it can be completely immobilized; in the US they are used to carry badly damaged cars from crashes. Lift flatbed *Lift flatbed: a boom uses a wheel-lift frame to lift the vehicle vertically and load it on the bed. Used in Europe, this truck can remove vehicles that are parallel-parked. These are the most common arrangements, but are by no means exclusive, as there are flatbed units that offer a wheel-lift, boom trucks that can recover but not tow, and wheel-lift units that offer a combination boom with sling. There are also several sizes and weight categories of tow truck. The lightest models are usually based on light truck and van chassis offering boom and tow weights of around , making them ideal for car towing. Most flatbed-type vehicles are based on medium duty and heavy duty trucks to provide the chassis strength necessary to carry entire vehicles. A step up from that are medium-duty tow trucks offering boom capacity of . Heavier still are the heavy duty tow trucks based on chassis used by semi trucks, with multiple axles and the ability to tow fully loaded semi truck and trailer combinations, with boom capacity from . At the top are the rotators, which can range from (though lighter models do exist as seen at the right) and often come with a wealth of other features per customer specification.  Operations  Heavy trucks working on a recovery Integrated wheel-lift loading Loading a flatbed with a winch An improperly parked car in Moscow is being towed by police. Heavy tow truck recovering a bus Tow trucks are usually operated by private businesses, except for major highways and toll roads, where the road authority may operate the tow trucks for that stretch of road. Some police departments own tow trucks, but in the US it is common to contract police tows to private companies. Businesses who operate a large fleet of vehicles, such as school bus companies or package delivery services, often own one or several tow trucks for the purposes of towing their own vehicles. Government departments with large fleets (such as the police departments, fire departments, transportation authorities and departments of public works of major cities) may similarly own tow truck(s). Police department tow trucks may also be used to impound other vehicles. Heavy tow trucks are often called to clear semi truck accidents and straighten out jackknifed trucks. In rural or unorganized areas, companies which operate tow trucks can sometimes also offer additional services appropriate to highway clearance where government-provided ones are unavailable, such as fire suppression. The military also deploys tow trucks for recovery of stranded vehicles. In the US Army, a variant of the HEMTT truck is used for this purpose, the M984 wrecker. For recovery in combat situations while under fire, many armies with large vehicle fleets also deploy armoured recovery vehicles. These vehicles fulfill a similar role, but are resistant to heavy fire and capable of traversing rough terrain with their tracks, as well as towing vehicles beyond the weight limits of wheeled wreckers, such as tanks (many are based on tank designs for this very reason). Each state and territory of Australia has its own regulations and acts for the operation of tow trucks. Tow trucks are generally divided into two categories, either by standard, trade and private towing or Accident Towing. Accident Towing tow trucks are clearly identifiable by number plates ending in either \\"ATT\\" or \\"TT\\". Tow trucks which are not endorsed for \\"accident towing may use general number plates of any combination pursuant to each states own registering system. An example of a statute regulating the operation of tow trucks and the towing industry in Victoria is the Victorian Accident Towing Services Act.

With a high level of artistry and daring innovations, they were considered by many to be the greatest tap dancers of their day. Their performance in the musical number \\"Jumpin' Jive\\" (with Cab Calloway and his orchestra) featured in the movie Stormy Weather has been praised as one of the most virtuosic film dance routines of all time. Growing up surrounded by vaudeville acts as children, they became stars of the jazz circuit during the Harlem Renaissance and performing on stage, film, and television well into the 1990s. Early lives Fayard Antonio Nicholas was born October 20, 1914, in Mobile, Alabama and Harold Lloyd Nicholas was born March 17, 1921, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Viola Harden (maiden; 1893‚Äì1971), a pianist, and Ulysses Dominick Nicholas (1892‚Äì1935), a drummer. The Nicholas Brothers grew up in Philadelphia, the sons of college-educated musicians who played in their own band at the Standard Theater‚Äîtheir mother at the piano and father on drums. At the age of three, Fayard would always sit in the front row while his parents worked, and by the time he was ten, he had seen most of the great African- American vaudeville acts‚Äîparticularly the dancers, including such notables of the time as Alice Whitman, Willie Bryant, and Bill Robinson. \\"Biography\\" . The Nicholas Brothers' official website. The brothers were fascinated by the combination of tap dancing and acrobatics. Fayard often imitated their acrobatics and clowning for the kids in his neighborhood. Neither Fayard nor Harold had any formal dance training.\\"Dancer Fayard Nicholas dies at 91\\", USA Today (Associated Press) (January 25, 2006). Fayard taught himself how to dance, sing, and perform by watching and imitating the professional entertainers on stage. He then taught his younger siblings, first performing with his sister Dorothy as the Nicholas Kids, later joined by Harold. Harold idolized his older brother and learned by copying his moves and distinct style. Dorothy later opted out of the act, and the Nicholas Kids became known as the Nicholas Brothers.\\"Nicholas Brothers\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. November 6, 2013. Career As word spread of their talents, the Nicholas Brothers became known around Philadelphia. They were first hired for a radio program, The Horn and Hardart Kiddie Hour, and then by other local theatres such as the Standard and the Pearl. When they were performing at the Pearl, the manager of The Lafayette, a New York vaudeville showcase, saw them and immediately wanted them to perform for his theater. The brothers moved to Philadelphia in 1926 and gave their first performance at the Standard a few years later.Imogen Sara Smith, \\"The Nicholas Brothers\\" , Dance Heritage Coalition, 2012. In 1932 they became the featured act at Harlem's Cotton Club, when Harold was 11 and Fayard was 18. They astonished their mainly white audiences dancing to the jazz tempos of \\"Bugle Call Rag\\" and they were the only entertainers in the African American cast allowed to mingle with white patrons. Fayard Nicholas biography page at the Internet Movie Database. They performed at the Cotton Club for two years, working with the orchestras of Lucky Millinder, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Jimmy Lunceford. During this time, they filmed their first movie short, Pie Pie Blackbird, in 1932, with Eubie Blake and his orchestra. In their hybrid of tap dance, ballet, and acrobatics‚Äîsometimes called acrobatic dancing or \\"flash dancing\\"‚Äîno individual or group surpassed the effect that the Nicholas Brothers had on audiences and on other dancers. The brothers attributed their success to this unique style of dancing, which was greatly in demand during this time. Producer Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the Cotton Club and, impressed by their entertaining performance, invited them to California to be a part of Kid Millions (1934), which was their first role in a Hollywood movie.Biography (p. 4) , Nicholas Brothers website. The brothers made their Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and also appeared in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's musical Babes in Arms in 1937. They impressed their choreographer, George Balanchine, who invited them to appear in Babes in Arms. With Balanchine's training, they learned many new stunts. Their talent led many to presume they were trained ballet dancers.Biography (p. 5) , Nicholas Brothers website. By 1940, they had moved to Hollywood and for several decades divided their time between movies, nightclubs, concerts, Broadway, television, and extensive tours of Latin America, Africa, and Europe. They toured England with a production of Blackbirds, which gave the Nicholas Brothers an opportunity to see and appreciate several of the great European ballet companies. In 1991, the Nicholas Brothers received Kennedy Center Honors to recognize their achievements spanning 60 years. A year later, a documentary film We Sing & We Dance celebrated their careers and included tributes from Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, M.C. Hammer, and Clarke Peters. In 1994, members of the cast of Hot Shoe Shuffle also paid tribute to the Nicholas Brothers.https://www.cmgww.com/stars/nicholasbrothers/ Teaching The Nicholas Brothers taught master classes in tap dance as teachers-in-residence at Harvard University and Radcliffe as Ruth Page Visiting Artists. Among their known students are Debbie Allen, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson.

Its best remembered performance is in the finale of the movie Stormy Weather (1943). In that routine, the Nicholas Brothers leapt exuberantly across the orchestra's music stands and danced on the top of a grand piano in a call and response act with the pianist, to the tune of \\"Jumpin' Jive\\". Fred Astaire once told the brothers that this dance number was the greatest movie musical sequence he had ever seen.Nicholas Brothers dancing in \\"Jumpin' Jive\\" in Stormy Weather (1943) In another signature move, they would rise from a split without using their hands. Gregory Hines declared that if their biography were ever filmed, their dance numbers would have to be computer-generated because no one now could emulate them. Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov once called them the most amazing dancers he had ever seen in his life.\\"Mean feet: the tap-dancing duo who were Fred Astaire's heroes\\", The Guardian, 10 Oct 2016.

Purchase and conversion Lexington was built as a sidewheel steamer at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1861 and was purchased by the War Department and converted into a gunboat at Cincinnati, Ohio, under the direction of Commander John Rodgers. The gunboat, operated by the navy, joined the army's Western Flotilla at Cairo, Illinois, 12 August 1861. On 22 August, she seized steamer W. B. Terry at Paducah, Kentucky, and on 4 September, with , she engaged Confederate gunboat Jackson and southern shore batteries at Hickman and Columbus, Kentucky. On 6 September, the two gunboats spearheaded General Ulysses S. Grant's drive to seize strategic Paducah and Smithland, Kentucky, at the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. In his first use of strength afloat, Grant countered a Confederate move into the state, helping preserve Kentucky for the Union and foreshadowing his skillful use of naval mobility and support during the coming campaigns which divided the Confederacy and won the entire Mississippi system for the Union. Lexingtons next action came on the 10th when she and silenced a Confederate battery and damaged Jackson at Lucas Bend, Missouri, while covering a troop advance. An 8-inch shell from Lexington exploded in Jacksons starboard wheelhouse causing severe damage. Only the powerful batteries on the bluffs at Columbus, Kentucky, saved Jackson and another Southern steamer from capture. Battle of Belmont Lexington with Tyler at Belmont After accompanying an expedition to Owensboro, Kentucky, on 22-25 September, Lexington again engaged the batteries of Columbus on 7 October. With Tyler a month later, she protected General Grant's army during the Battle of Belmont silencing enemy batteries which opposed the landings. When a large number of fresh Confederate troops threatened Grant's men, well directed fire of grape and canister from Lexington and Tyler scattered the Southern reinforcements enabling the Union soldiers to reach safety on their transports. Battle of Fort Henry The Western Flotilla steamed up the Tennessee River to attack Fort Henry which guarded this water approach to the South's heartland. Although the operation was originally planned as a joint expedition, heavy rains for 2 days before the attack delayed troop movements so the gunboats attacked alone 6 February 1862. Accurate fire from the gunboats pounded the fort and forced Brigadier General Lloyd Tilghman, CSA, with all but four of his defending guns useless, to strike his flag. In continuing operations the three days following the capitulation of Fort Henry, Tyler, Conestoga and Lexington swept the Tennessee for Confederate transports, seized the unfinished steamer Eastport, and destroyed a railroad bridge spanning the river. Battle of Shiloh Lexington with Tyler at Shiloh After repairs Lexington rejoined Tyler protecting army transports and supporting troop movements along the Tennessee River. On 1 March the gunboats engaged Confederate forces fortifying Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing) Tennessee. They landed a party of sailors and army sharpshooters to reconnoiter Confederate strength in the area. They then moved further upstream and engaged a Confederate battery at Chickasaw, Alabama, on the 12th. Later in the month they steamed upstream to Eastport, Mississippi, where they exchanged fire with Southern artillery. The capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson opened serious breaches in the Confederancy's outer defense line which Grant was quick to exploit. Southern troops commanded by Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, made a major effort to stem his advance in the Battle of Shiloh and came close to overwhelming the Union troops. Major General Leonidas Polk, CSA, reported that the Confederate forces \\"were within from 150 to 400 yards of the enemy's position, and nothing seemed wanting to complete the most brilliant victory of the war but to press forward and make a vigorous assault on the demoralized remnant of his forces. At this juncture his gunboats dropped down the river, near the landing where his troops were collected, and opened a tremendous cannonade of shot and shell over the bank, in the direction from where our forces were approaching.\\" This timely support from Lexington and Tyler swung the delicate balance of forces back to the Union side and saved Grant's men from disaster. After the day was over, the Lexington and Tyler spent the night bombarding the Confederate army, which had settled down in Union camps they had captured early in the morning assault. Firing into the darkness, the gunboats caused few casualties, but they did prevent many Confederate soldiers from getting any sleep. Battle of Saint Charles Lexington continued to support army operations in the Tennessee River until steaming down the Mississippi with Conestoga, , and to enter the White River (Arkansas), 14 June. While the Union gunboats, were capturing St. Charles, Arkansas, 17 June a direct hit exploded Mound Citys steam drum scalding many of her men. The injured crewmen were treated on Lexington as she pushed 63 miles further upriver to Crooked Point Cut-off where shallow water forced her to turn back. The gunboat then returned to the Mississippi to protect army transports from guerilla bands which attacked from the river banks. Yazoo River, Fort Hindman, and Cumberland River operations Lexington, which transferred to the navy with the other ships of the Western Flotilla on 1 October 1862, participated in the joint expedition up the Yazoo River to attack Vicksburg, Mississippi from the rear. On 27 December, while clearing mines from the river, the Union gunboats fought off heavy attacks by Confederate batteries. The next day they provided cover fire for General Sherman's troops during an attack on Confederate-held Chickasaw Bayou. \\"Through these operations,\\" David Dixon Porter wrote, \\"the Navy did everything that could be done to ensure the success of General Sherman's movement.\\" Though the navy supplied shore bombardment from the squadron and created diversionary movements, the Union troops, hindered by heavy rains and faced by the timely arrival of Confederate reinforcements, were forced to withdraw. On 4 January 1863, the gunboats and army transports headed up the White River, Arkansas, to attack Fort Hindman. The squadron covered the landing of troops on the 9th by shelling Confederate rifle pits. The next day, though the Army was not in position to press the attack, the Union ships moved to within 60 yards of the staunchly defended fort and began a blistering engagement which softened the works for the next day's assault. When the Union troops charged the position on the 11th, the gunboats resumed their well-directed fire and silenced every southern gun. After this defeat the Confederates evacuated other positions on the White and Saint Charles rivers. Meanwhile, Confederate raiders were threatening to wrest control of the Cumberland Valley from the Union. Answering General William Rosecrans' appeal for naval support, Lexington got underway for the Cumberland River on 25 January. The joint army-navy cooperation kept the upper rivers open to the Union and prevented an effective Confederate counteroffensive. Frequently fighting off attacks from Southern snipers and flying batteries, Lexington escorted transports and destroyed Confederate positions along the banks. On 3 February with five other ships she helped repulse a Confederate attempt to retake Fort Donelson. When they reached the scene of the battle they found the defending troops \\"out of ammunition and entirely surrounded by the rebels in overwhelming numbers, but still holding them in check.\\" Lexington routed the Confederates in a hurry. Battle of Milliken's Bend Ordered down the Mississippi on 2 June to support final operations against Vicksburg, Lexington joined in defending Union troops at Milliken's Bend, Mississippi, from the assault of numerically superior Confederate soldiers on the 7th. For the next month she continued to operate against the mighty Confederate fortress until it fell on 4 July. After reconnaissance work and patrol duty in the Mississippi during the summer, Lexington was ordered back to the Tennessee River on 29 October to assist General Sherman at the beginning of his drive through the Confederate heartland. However, at the end of February 1864, she returned to the Mississippi for operations in support of the Red River Campaign. With paddle wheel monitor and four other gunboats she moved up the Black River to gather information about Confederate sharpshooters as they entered the Ouachita River and proceeded up the Bayou Louis where shallowing water compelled them to return, capturing Confederate artillery and large quantities of cotton before reaching the mouth of the Red River on 5 March. A week later the Mississippi Squadron moved up the Red River in force. Red River The Confederate defenders were driven off at Simmesport and General Smith's troops marched on Fort De Russy, Louisiana, which was taken by the combined land and naval forces on 14 March 1864. The next day Lexington with gunboat Ouachita, followed by the Eastport, pushed on toward Alexandria, Louisiana, chasing Confederate steamers fleeing toward safety above the Alexandria rapids; but the Union ships arrived less than an hour too late to capture six steamers which had succeeding in getting over the falls. Confederate steamer Countess which grounded in flight and a barge left behind were burned to prevent capture. The army transports arrived the next day and troops were landed to occupy that town. On 7 April, Lexington and five other gunboats steamed over the falls toward Shreveport, Louisiana, to support General Nathaniel Prentiss Banks who was advancing up the valley. Three days later the hulk of steamer New Falls City, sunk in a narrow stretch of the river near Springfield Landing, Louisiana, blocked the progress of the expedition. Before this obstruction could be removed, word arrived from Major General Banks of his defeat at the Battle of Sabine Crossroads near Grand Encore and retreat toward Pleasant Hill. The transports and troops of Brig. Gen. T. K. Smith were ordered to return to the major force and join Banks. The high point of the Union's Red River campaign had been reached. From this point, with falling water levels and increased Confederate shore fire the gunboats would face a desperate battle to avoid being trapped above the Alexandria rapids. Lexington silenced the shore battery but the Confederate cavalry poured a hail of musket fire into the rest of the squadron. The rebels fought with unusual pertinacity for over an hour, delivering the heaviest and most concentrated fire of musketry. What Porter described as \\"this curious affair,...a fight between infantry and gunboats\\", was finally decided by the gunboats' fire, which inflicted heavy losses on the Confederates, including the death of their commander, General Thomas Green. This engagement featured the use of a unique instrument, developed by Chief Engineer Thomas Doughty of Osage and later described by Selfridge as \\"a method of sighting the turret from the outside, by means of what would now be called a periscope...\\" The high banks of the Red River posed a great difficulty for the ships' gunners in aiming their cannon from water level. Doughty's ingenious apparatus helped to solve the problem. Thus was the periscope, a familiar sight on modern gun turrets and on submarines, brought into Civil War use on the western waters. Upon reaching Grand Encore the fleet faced a dangerous situation. The Red River, normally high until late June, had fallen so much that the gunboats could not pass over the rapids and it seemed that the better part of the Mississippi Squadron was doomed to destruction as the Union Army made plans for evacuation. However, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bailey USA, proposed a plan for building a series of dams across the rocks of the falls and raising the water. A center opening would let the ships ride out on the crest of the water. On 9 May 1864, the dam had nearly reached completion but the pressure of the water became so great that it swept away two stone barges which swung in below the dam on one side. Seeing this accident, Admiral Porter mounted a horse and rode up to where upper vessels were anchored and ordered Lexington to get underway. Lexington crosses over the falls Lieutenant Bache succeeded in getting Lexington over the upper falls, then steered her directly for the opening in the dam where the furiously raging waters seemed to promise only her destruction. She entered the gap in the dam with a full head of steam and pitched down the powerful torrent with several heavy rolls, hung for a moment on the rocks below, then reached the calm, deep water to the ringing cheers of some 30,000 voices. She was soon followed by the remainder of the vessels and the Union's valuable fleet was saved. On 15 June 1864, Lexington seized the Confederate steamers Mattie, M. Walt and R. E. Hill, at Beulah Landing, Mississippi, with cotton on board. She repulsed an attack on White River Station, Arkansas, on 22 June 1864. For the rest of the war she continued patrol and convoy duty. She arrived at Mound City, Illinois on 5 June 1865 and decommissioned there on 2 July 1865. Lexington was sold to Thomas Scott and Woodburn on 17 August 1865.

Nicholas was the younger half of the tap-dancing pair the Nicholas Brothers, known as two of the world's greatest dancers. His older brother was Fayard Nicholas. Nicholas starred in the MGM musicals An All- Colored Vaudeville Show (1935), Stormy Weather (1943), The Pirate (1948). and The Five Heartbeats (1991). Life and career =Early years= Nicholas was born to drummer and orchestra leader Ulysses Domonick and pianist Viola Harden in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. By the age of three, his older brother Fayard enjoyed sitting in the audience of the black vaudeville theater where his parents performed, enraptured by the great performers on stage. Immersed in show business, when the Nicholases added a second son to the family, seven- year-old Fayard insisted that the child be named after his idol, Harold Lloyd, the silent-screen comedian. The two brothers soon began dancing, and they quickly gained acclaim for their elegant acrobatic moves and mastery of tap. When Fayard was 16 and Harold nine, they made their first appearance at the legendary Cotton Club in New York City and were a popular success immediately. = Career = Their reputation grew rapidly, and Harold and Fayard became established superstars at Twentieth Century Fox with their astounding dance numbers in the studio's musicals features. The brothers began appearing in musical films with Eubie Blake. They performed in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs, on television, and in movie musicals. Harold appeared in more than 50 feature films, including The Big Broadcast (1936), Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which features the show-stopping \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" tap dance number performed by Harold, Fayard, and Dorothy Dandridge. Fred Astaire told the brothers that their dazzling footwork, leaps and splits in the Jumpin‚Äô Jive dance in Stormy Weather (1943) produced the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen. In the number, the brothers dance on a piano and leap over performing musicians. The Nicholas Brothers‚Äô Hollywood career began after movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn spotted them in a nightclub and cast them in Kid Millions (1934). The two became big film stars despite racial restrictions at the time prohibiting speaking parts and scenes with white co-stars. Their last film together was 1948‚Äôs The Pirate, in which Gene Kelly danced with them, breaking the color barrier. Harold went on to work as a solo artist, moving to France and touring as a singer and dancer.

The others are Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake), and Lake Okataina. All lie within the Okataina caldera, along its western edge. Geography DoC campsiteleft The lake has a circumference of and lies about above Lake Tarawera. Its outlet flows underground for half a mile and forms the Waitangi waterfall. In fact, the Okareka lake seems to be connected with the Tarawera by underground channels.Ferdinand von Hochstetter, Edward Sauter (2010). New Zealand: its physical geography, geology and natural history, Kessinger Publishing, p. 406. History This small and little- visited lake is a place of much charm, surrounded by hills nearly everywhere thickly wooded. It is quite near, but out of sight from the tourist motor route of Rotorua and Tarawera; a side road gives access to it. Anglers find good sport there, but otherwise its solitude is not disturbed yet. Many years ago a settler acquired some of the land around it, and built his house on a low-lying isthmus which connects an island-like hill in the middle of the lake with the mainland. Some of the frontage is still in private hands, but the greater part of the basin in which the lake lies has now become residential property. Okareka means \\"the lake of sweet food\\". In early times, MƒÅori grew sweet potatoes or kumara around the outside of the lake. It first described in print by Sir George Grey, and poetic mention of it is made by Alfred Domett in his \\"Ranolf and Amohia.\\" Grey visited it on the course of his travels through the Lakes Country to Taupo in the summer of 1849-50. The journey is described in that rare little book entitled \\"Journal of an expedition Overland from Auckland to Taranaki\\", written for the Governor by his secretary G. S. Cooper, with a translation into Maori by his interpreter, Piri-kawau; the book was published in Auckland in 1851. In those days, the route from Ohinemutu to Tarawera was a track which skirted the shore of Okareka and reached the large lake near the mission station called Kariri (Galilee). It was a blistering hot day when Governor Grey and his party took the foot trail from Rotorua to Tarawera, and the narrator says they were \\"nearly stewed\\". \\"We reached the beautiful lake of Okareka,\\" the journal entry for 27 December 1849, runs, \\"just at a place where there is a spring of deliciously cool water, wherewith we all refreshed ourselves and then proceeded to cross the lake in canoes. The lake is really an extremely pretty sight, the shores being lofty and wooded, with the exception of a valley at each end, where the roads run. A peninsula, on which stands the pa called Taumaihi, juts out into the centre of the lake. The waters are beautifully clear, and very deep. There is no apparent outlet to this lake. Its vent consists of an underground stream, which is hidden for about half a mile, and then makes its appearance, looking like a fountain, gushing through a heap of rocks and square stones of a basaltic formation, whence it makes its way in a small stream to Tarawera, the level of which is about sixty feet lower than that of Okareka, and into which the water falls down a declivity of twenty feet, forming a beautiful cascade, surrounded and overshadowed by a clump of karaka and other evergreen trees.\\" In those days the shores of Okareka were a scene of Maori life; there were cultivations on the waterside, and the natives fished the waters for whitebait, the koura crayfish, and the little fish called toitoi, which abounded there before the Pakeha trout was introduced. In the ‚Äòsixties Alfred Domett visited Okareka and Tarawera by the track Grey took. The forest in this reserve extends to the western side of Lake Okataina and the Whakapoungakau Range. Red deer roam the bush, and however desirable they may be from the Rotorua sportsmen‚Äôs point of view they are not doing any good to this forest sanctuary. Known for its natural environment, this lake has an adjacent settlement of approximately 600 people. The lake is accessible from the tourist location of Rotorua. Pollution Lake ≈åkareka has reasonably clear, clean water and is used extensively for recreation such as boating, swimming and fishing. However, the quality of the water has been declining over recent years due to excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients come from surrounding farmland, residential septic tanks and from the release of existing and accumulated nutrients from sediments on the lake bed. The Lake ≈åkareka Catchment Management Plan was developed in 2004. This is a long-term plan to improve the water quality of the lake, through changes like sewage reticulation, in-lake chemical treatment and farm nutrient management. It has been calculated that the load nutrients needed to reach the target TLI of 3.0 are 2.5 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 0.08 tonnes per year of phosphorus. The Trophic Level Index (TLI) is an overall indication of lake health based on a number of different criteria, values represent a three-yearly average. Better quality sites have a lower TLI. The three-yearly average for ≈åkareka indicates little change over the last five years.

Its main purpose is to provide electric current to the electricity-powered starting motor, which in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle. Once the engine is running, power for the car's electrical systems is still supplied by the battery, with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or decrease. Battery in modern cars =Gasoline and diesel engine= Typically, starting uses less than three percent of the battery capacity. For this reason, automotive batteries are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time. They are sometimes referred to as \\"SLI batteries\\" for this reason, for starting, lighting, and ignition. SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging, and a full discharge can reduce the battery's lifespan. As well as starting the engine, an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle's electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system. It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes. While the engine is running, most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5 V. Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12 volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24 volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example. Gas explosions can occur at the negative electrode where hydrogen gas can build up due to blocked battery vents or a poorly ventilated setting, combined with an ignition source. Explosions during engine start up are typically associated with corroded or dirty battery posts. A 1993 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 31% of vehicle battery explosion injuries occurred while charging the battery. The next most common scenarios were while working on cable connections, while jump starting, typically by failing to connect to the dead battery before the charging source and failing to connect to the vehicle chassis rather than directly to the grounded battery post, and while checking fluid levels. Close to two thirds of those injured suffered chemical burns, and nearly three fourths suffered eye injuries, among other possible injuries. =Electric and hybrid cars = Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12 V. They are often referred to as auxiliary batteries. Unlike conventional, internal combustion engined vehicles, EVs don't charge the auxiliary battery with an alternator‚Äîinstead, they use a DC-to-DC converter to step down the high Voltage to the required float-charge voltage (typically around 14 V). History Early cars did not have batteries, as their electrical systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starter motors. The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971. The first starting and charging systems were designed to be 6-volt and positive- ground systems, with the vehicle's chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal. Today, almost all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal is connected to the car's chassis. The Hudson Motor Car Company was the first to use a standardized battery in 1918 when they started using Battery Council International batteries. BCI is the organization that sets the dimensional standards for batteries. Cars used 6 V electrical systems and batteries until the mid-1950s. The changeover from 6 to 12 V happened when bigger engines with higher compression ratios required more electrical power to start. Smaller cars, which required less power to start stayed with 6 V longer, for example the Volkswagen Beetle in the mid-1960s and the Citro√´n 2CV in 1970. In the 1990s a 42V electrical system standard was proposed. It was intended to allow more powerful electrically driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques, and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators have largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages. Design An automobile battery is an example of a wet cell battery, with six cells. Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates made of a lead alloy grid filled with sponge lead (cathode plates) or coated with lead dioxide (anode). Each cell is filled with a sulfuric acid solution, which is the electrolyte. Initially, cells each had a filler cap, through which the electrolyte level could be viewed and which allowed water to be added to the cell. The filler cap had a small vent hole which allowed hydrogen gas generated during charging to escape from the cell. The cells are connected by short heavy straps from the positive plates of one cell to the negative plates of the adjacent cell. A pair of heavy terminals, plated with lead to resist corrosion, are mounted at the top, sometimes the side, of the battery. Early auto batteries used hard rubber cases and wooden plate separators. Modern units use plastic cases and woven sheets to prevent the plates of a cell from touching and short-circuiting. In the past, auto batteries required regular inspection and maintenance to replace water that was decomposed during operation of the battery. \\"Low-maintenance\\" (sometimes called \\"zero- maintenance\\") batteries use a different alloy for the plate elements, reducing the amount of water decomposed on charging. A modern battery may not require additional water over its useful life; some types eliminate the individual filler caps for each cell. A weakness of these batteries is that they are very intolerant of deep discharge, such as when the car battery is completely drained by leaving the lights on. This coats the lead plate electrodes with lead sulfate deposits and can reduce the battery's lifespan by a third or more. VRLA batteries, also known as absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries are more tolerant of deep discharge, but are more expensive. VRLA batteries do not permit addition of water to the cell. The cells each have an automatic pressure release valve, to protect the case from rupture on severe overcharge or internal failure. A VRLA battery cannot spill its electrolyte which makes it particularly useful in vehicles such as motorcycles. Batteries are typically made of six galvanic cells in a series circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volts at full charge. During discharge, at the negative (lead) terminal a chemical reaction releases electrons to the external circuit, and at the positive (lead oxide) terminal another chemical reaction absorbs electrons from the external circuit. This drives the electrons through the external circuit wire (an electrical conductor) to produce an electric current (electricity). As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated. Some vehicles use other starter batteries. The 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 RS has a lithium-ion battery as an option to save weight. Heavy vehicles may have two batteries in series for a 24 V system or may have series-parallel groups of batteries supplying 24 V. Specifications =Physical format= Batteries are grouped by physical size, type and placement of the terminals, and mounting style. =Amp hours (Ah)= Ampere hours (Ah or A¬∑h) is a unit related to the energy storage capacity of the battery. This rating is required by law in Europe. =Cranking amperages (CCA, CA, MCA, HCA)= *Cold cranking amperes (CCA): the amount of current a battery can provide at . Modern cars with computer controlled fuel-injected engines take no more than a few seconds to start and CCA figures are less important than they used to be. It is important not to confuse CCA with CA/MCA or HCA numbers as the latter will always be higher due to warmer temperatures. For example, a 250 CCA battery will have more starting power than a 250 CA (or MCA) one, and likewise a 250 CA will have more than a 250 HCA one. * Cranking amperes (CA): the amount of current a battery can provide at . * Marine cranking amperes (MCA): like CA, the amount of current a battery can provide at , and often found on batteries for boats (hence \\"marine\\") and lawn garden tractors which are less likely to be operated in conditions where ice can form. * Hot cranking amperes (HCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at . The rating is defined as the current a lead-acid battery at that temperature can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt battery). =Reserve capacity minutes (RCM)= A battery's ability to sustain a minimum stated electrical load; it is defined as the time (in minutes) that a lead- acid battery at will continuously deliver 25 amperes before its voltage drops below 10.5 volts. =Group size= Battery Council International (BCI) group size specifies a battery's physical dimensions, such as length, width, and height. These groups are determined by the organization. =Date codes= * In the United States there are codes on batteries to help consumers buy a recently produced one. When batteries are stored, they start losing their charge; this is due to non-current-producing chemical reactions of the electrodes with the battery acid. A battery made in October 2015 will have a numeric code of 10-5 or an alphanumeric code of K-5. \\"A\\" is for January, \\"B\\" is for February, and so on (the letter \\"I\\" is skipped). * In South Africa the code on a battery to indicate production date is part of the casing and cast into the bottom left of the cover. The code is year and week number (YYWW), e.g. 1336 is for week 36 in the year 2013. Use and maintenance Excess heat is a main cause of battery failures, as when the electrolyte evaporates due to high temperatures, decreasing the effective surface area of the plates exposed to the electrolyte, and leading to sulfation. Grid corrosion rates increase with temperature. Also low temperatures can lead to battery failure. If the battery is discharged to the point where it can't start the engine, the engine can be jump started via an external source of power. Once running, the engine can recharge the battery, if the alternator and charging system are undamaged. Corrosion at the battery terminals can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance, which can be prevented by the proper application of dielectric grease. Sulfation is when the electrodes become coated with a hard layer of lead sulfate, which weakens the battery. Sulfation can happen when battery is not fully charged and remains discharged. Sulfated batteries should be charged slowly to prevent damage. SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharge, and their life is reduced when subjected to this. Car batteries using lead-antimony plates require regular topping-up with pure water to replace water lost due to electrolysis and evaporation. By changing the alloying element to calcium, more recent designs have reduced the rate of water loss. Modern car batteries have reduced maintenance requirements, and may not provide caps for addition of water to the cells. Such batteries include extra electrolyte above the plates to allow for losses during the battery life. Some battery manufacturers include a built-in hydrometer to show the state of charge of the battery. A positive (red) jumper cable connected to battery post. An optional hydrometer window is visible by the single jumper clamp. The black negative jumper clamp is not shown. The primary wear-out mechanism is the shedding of active material from the battery plates, which accumulates at the bottom of the cells and which may eventually short-circuit the plates. This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags, made from a permeable material. This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates. The sludge largely consists of lead sulfate, which is produced at both electrodes.  Environmental impact  Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for the manufacture of new batteries, diverts toxic lead from landfills, and prevents the risk of improper disposal. Once a lead‚Äìacid battery ceases to hold a charge, it is deemed a used lead-acid battery (ULAB), which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. The 12-volt car battery is the most recycled product in the world, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the U.S. alone, about 100 million auto batteries a year are replaced, and 99 percent of them are turned in for recycling. However the recycling may be done incorrectly in unregulated environments. As part of global waste trade ULABs are shipped from industrialized countries to developing countries for disassembly and recuperation of the contents. About 97 percent of the lead can be recovered. Pure Earth estimates that over 12 million third world people are affected by lead contamination from ULAB processing.

The film consists of a series of psychedelic performances and interviews and features live performance by Pink Floyd, together with footage of John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Vanessa Redgrave, Lee Marvin, Julie Christie, Allen Ginsberg, Eric Burdon, Michael Caine and many others attending one of the band's concerts. In 1990 See for Miles Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack on CD under the title Tonite Let's All Make Love in London ...Plus (Catalog Number: SEEK 258). The album included most of the tracks from Tonite Let's All Make Love in London. Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? and Lady Jane by the Rolling Stones is featured in the movie but not on any version of the soundtrack album. \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which had only appeared in a 3.02 edited form on the original release was replaced by the previously unreleased 16:46 full-length version. Another long and previously unreleased instrumental track by Pink Floyd, the 11:50 \\"Nick's Boogie\\", was also included in this release, together with the interviews that appear in the film. Other versions of this soundtrack have also been released. In 1996, Power House 2001 Records released a CD under the name, Pink Floyd & Friends ‚Äì Interstellar Overdrive that included the full 16:49 \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Nick's Boogie\\" (at 11:47) by Pink Floyd, plus an interview with Mick Jagger and an introductory reading by Allen Ginsberg called \\"Tonight Let's All Make Love in London\\".

It is a parish church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia. History First mention of the St. Peter's Church is in records dating to 1209. The church was of masonry construction and therefore undamaged by a city fire in Riga that year. The history of the church can be divided into three distinct periods: two associated with Gothic and Romanesque building styles and the third with the early Baroque period. The middle section of the church was built during the 13th century, which encompasses the first period. The only remnants of this period are located in the outer nave walls and on the inside of a few pillars in the nave, around which larger pillars were later built. Three identical portals by Bindenshu and Andreas Peterman were added in 1692. =Second period of construction= The second period dates to 1408‚Äì09, when master builder from Rostock supervised the construction of the sanctuary, based on the St. Mary's Church in Rostock. The sanctuary was almost finished by 1409, but due to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War it was completed and dedicated only in 1419. Other construction work was interrupted by the plague in 1420 and resumed in the 1430s. The 13th-century church was reconstructed in 1456‚Äì66 to conform to the newly built sanctuary. Both constructions were joined in the 1470s, thereby creating a mighty basilica with three aisles and ornate vaulted ceilings. The old bell tower was replaced in 1456, and a bell was hung in the new tower in 1477. A octagonal steeple was added to the tower in 1491, which, along with the church's front facade, dominated the silhouette of Riga. The tower collapsed 11 March 1666, destroying a neighboring building and burying eight people in the rubble. The cornerstone for a new tower was laid 29 June 1667. The nave =Third period of construction= The third period of construction dates to 1671‚Äì90, with the construction of the western facade and the new tower. The roof, vaulted ceilings and furnishings were also renovated during this time. Jacob Josten, the Dutch-born master builder of Riga, designed the tower and supervised its construction, which was begun April 1671 by the master mason Heinrich Henicke. Josten was replaced in 1675 by (1645‚Äì1698), the next master builder of Riga. The tower was completed in 1677, but it, along with the church interior, were destroyed already 21 May 1677, during a citywide fire. Bindenshu supervised the subsequent repairs in 1677‚Äì79: vaulted wooden ceilings replaced the former masonry vaulted ceilings, and the roof, windows, interior and furnishings were replaced or renovated. First service in the renovated church took place 14 September 1679. Renovation of the tower began 1686 and was designed by the city engineer Friedrich S. von Dahlen. The city council did not approve of the half-finished steeple, and so it was torn down in 1688. A new copper-roofed steeple, designed by Bindenshu, was then built. A sphere and rooster were set atop the steeple 10 May 1690. This tower was the tallest wooden construction in Europe at the time. The western facade of the church was also altered in the later 17th century. The brick construction was covered with reddish limestone from Salaspils and Koknese, and the facade was decorated with volutes, pilasters, cornices, vases and borders made of Gotland stone. In 1692 the Riga City Council approved a design by Bindenshu and the mason Andreas Peterman for three identical portals. The merchant Klaus Mistett financed the portals, which were built by H. Henneken, Johann Daniel Schauss, Johann Gerwin and several other sculptors. The portals were decorated with Baroque style limestone sculptures. In 1694 L. Martini installed a new tower clock with a glockenspiel from Amsterdam. =First reconstruction= The newly renovated church served for a mere 29 years, for lightning struck and set fire to the tower and church 10 May 1721. Only the church and tower walls remained standing after the fire. Reconstruction of the church began immediately under the direction of the master carpenter Tom Bochum and master mason Kristofer Meinert. By 1723 the building already had a temporary roof. Johann Heinrich Wilbern took over supervision of the project in 1740, and under his direction a new steeple was built in 1746. The steeple was covered with copper-plate and the rooster was gilded in 1746‚Äì47. Christoph Haberland designed a new marble pulpit for the church, which was built in Italy in 1793. In 1794 Haberland renovated the wooden vaulted ceilings in the central sections of the nave. The interior walls were plastered and the lower sections of the pillars were covered with oak panels in 1885 under the direction of architect Reinhold Georg Schmaeling (1840‚Äì1917). =Second reconstruction= The shape of St. Peter's Church after it burned down during World War II Artillery fire destroyed the church on 29 June 1941. Conservation and restoration began 1954 with research by architect Pƒìteris Saulƒ´tis. The work was carried out from 1967 to 1983 under the direction of Saulƒ´tis and architect GunƒÅrs Zirnis. Renovation began with the metal tower frame. A rooster ‚Äì a precise reproduction of the previous rooster and the seventh rooster in all ‚Äì was placed atop the steeple 21 August 1970. The renovated tower clock began to show time in July 1975. According to tradition, it has only an hour hand. The bell music began in 1976; it plays the Latvian folk melody \\"Rƒ´ga dimd\\" five times a day and bells ring at the top of every hour. The tower has an elevator installed that allows visitors a view of Riga from a height of . Renovation of the interior of the church ended in 1984. The Polish company \\"PKZ\\" restored the main facade and portals in 1987‚Äì91. The St. Peter's Latvian Lutheran congregation resumed services in the church 1991, and the church was returned to the ownership of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia on 4 April 2006. During World War II, the church lost an important object of cultural heritage - an impressive bronze candelabrum made in 1596 - which was taken to the town of W≈Çoc≈Çawek by Germans from Riga, resettled during \\"Heim ins Reich\\" action to annexed Polish territories. The 310 cm high and 378 cm wide candelabrum, previously called a standing lantern, was ordered by the City Council of Riga from the metal founder Hans Meyer's Riga foundry. After the war, it was displayed in W≈Çoc≈Çawek's Basilica Cathedral of the St. Mary of Assumption. On 1 March 2012 this piece of the Late Renaissance art returned to its ancient home, as a result of an agreement on the repatriation of cultural properties. The statue of the rooster on the top of the church weighs 158 kg and 140 grams of gold were used to gold plate the statue.

According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 play A Little Un-fairy Princess based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with \\"the things and people that had been left out before\\".Wordsworth edition of A Little Princess. The novel was published by Charles Scribner's Sons (also publisher of St. Nicholas) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number 56 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. It was the second of two Burnett novels among the Top 100, with The Secret Garden number 15. Plot \\"She slowly advanced into the parlor, clutching her doll\\": Illustration from Sara Crewe; or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (1888) Captain Richard Crewe, a wealthy English widower, has been raising his only child, Sara, in India where he is stationed with the British Army. Because the Indian climate is considered too harsh for children, British families living there traditionally send their children to boarding school back home in England. The captain enrolls his young daughter at Miss Minchin's boarding school for girls in London, and dotes on his daughter so much that he orders and pays the headmistress for special treatment and exceptional luxuries for Sara, such as a private room for her with a personal maid and a separate sitting room (see Parlour boarder), along with Sara's own private carriage and a pony. Miss Minchin openly fawns over Sara for her money, but secretly and jealously despises her for her wealth. Despite her privilege, Sara is neither selfish, arrogant, nor snobbish, but rather kind, polite, and generous. She extends her friendship to Ermengarde, the school dunce; to Lottie, a four-year-old student given to tantrums; and to Becky, the lowly, stunted fourteen-year-old scullery maid. When Sara acquires the epithet \\"Princess\\", she embraces its favorable elements in her natural goodheartedness. After some time, Sara's birthday is celebrated at Miss Minchin's with a lavish party, attended by all her friends and classmates. Just as it ends, Miss Minchin learns of Captain Crewe's unfortunate demise. Furthermore, prior to his death, the previously wealthy captain had lost his entire fortune; a friend had persuaded him to cash in his investments and deposit the proceeds to develop a network of diamond mines. The scheme fails, and Sara is left an orphan and a pauper, with no other family and nowhere to go. Miss Minchin is left with a sizable unpaid bill for Sara's school fees and luxuries, including her birthday party. Infuriated and pitiless, she takes away all of Sara's possessions (except for some old frocks and one doll), makes her live in a cold and poorly furnished attic, and forces her to earn her keep by working as an errand girl. She forces Sara to wear frocks much too short for her, with her thin legs peeking out of the brief skirts. For the next several years, Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Miss Minchin's kind-hearted sister, Amelia, deplores the way that Sara is treated, but is too weak-willed to speak up about it. Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and worn-out clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind to everyone, including those who find her annoying or mistreat her. One day, she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake. \\"He was waiting for his master to come out to the carriage, and Sara stopped and spoke a few words to him\\": Illustration from Sara Crewe; or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (1888) Meanwhile, Mr. Carrisford and his Indian assistant Ram Dass have moved into the house next door to Miss Minchin's school. Carrisford had been Captain Crewe's friend and partner in the diamond mines. After the diamond mine venture failed, both Crewe and Carrisford became very ill, and Carrisford in his delirium abandoned his friend Crewe, who died of his \\"brain fever\\". As it turned out, the diamond mines did not fail, but instead were a great success, making Carrisford extremely rich. Although Carrisford survived, he suffers from several ailments and is guilt-ridden over abandoning his friend. He is determined to find Crewe's daughter and heir, although he does not know where she is and thinks she is attending school in France. Ram Dass befriends Sara when his pet monkey escapes into Sara's adjoining attic. After climbing over the roof to Sara's room to get the monkey, Ram Dass tells Carrisford about Sara's poor living conditions. As a pleasant distraction, Carrisford and Ram Dass buy warm blankets, comfortable furniture, food, and other gifts, and secretly leave them in Sara's room when she is asleep or out. Sara's spirits and health improve due to the gifts she receives from her mysterious benefactor, whose identity she does not know; nor are Ram Dass and Carrisford aware that Sara is Crewe's lost daughter. When Carrisford anonymously sends Sara a package of new, well-made, and expensive clothing in her proper size, Miss Minchin becomes alarmed, thinking Sara might have a wealthy relative secretly looking out for her, and begins to treat Sara better and allows her to attend classes rather than doing menial work. One night, the monkey again runs away to Sara's room, and Sara visits Carrisford's house the next morning to return him. When Sara casually mentions that she was born in India, Carrisford and his solicitor question her and discover that she is Captain Crewe's daughter, for whom they have been searching for years. Sara also learns that Carrisford was her father's friend and her own anonymous benefactor, and that the diamond mines have produced great riches, of which she will now own her late father's share. When Miss Minchin angrily appears to collect Sara, she is informed that Sara will be living with Carrisford and her entire fortune has been restored and greatly increased. Upon finding this out, Miss Minchin unsuccessfully tries to persuade Sara into returning to her school as a star pupil, and then threatens to keep her from ever seeing her school friends again, but Carrisford and his solicitor tell Miss Minchin that Sara will see anyone she wishes to see and that her friends' parents are not likely to refuse invitations from an heiress to diamond mines. Miss Minchin goes home, where she is surprised when Amelia finally stands up to her. Amelia has a nervous breakdown afterwards, but she is on the road to gaining more respect. Sara invites Becky to live with her and be her personal maid, in much better living conditions than at Miss Minchin's. Carrisford becomes a friend to Sara and quickly regains his health. Finally, Sara‚Äîaccompanied by Becky‚Äîpays a visit to the bakery where she bought the buns, making a deal with the owner to cover the bills for bread for any hungry child. They find that the beggar girl who was saved from starvation by Sara's selfless act is now the bakery owner's assistant, with good food, clothing, shelter, and steady employment. Source material The novella appears to have been inspired in part by Charlotte Bront√´'s unfinished novel Emma, the first two chapters of which were published in Cornhill Magazine in 1860, featuring a rich heiress with a mysterious past who is apparently abandoned at a boarding school. Play Millie James as Sara in the Broadway production of Burnett's play, The Little Princess (1903) After writing Sara Crewe, Burnett returned to the material in 1902, penning the three-act stage play A Little Un-fairy Princess, which ran in London over the autumn of that year. Around the time it transferred to New York City at the start of 1903 the title was shortened to A Little Princess. (It was A Little Princess in London, but The Little Princess in New York.) Burnett said that after the production of the play on Broadway, her publisher, Charles Scribner's Sons, asked her to expand the story into a full-length novel and \\"put into it all the things and people that had been left out before.\\" The book was illustrated by Ethel Franklin Betts and published in 1905 under the full title A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time.

This Technicolor adaptation notably differs from the original, in that Sara's father is wounded and missing in action in wartime, and later is reunited with his daughter. Miss Minchin's younger sister Miss Amelia is replaced with \\"Mr Bertie\\", Miss Minchin's brother, a former music hall performer, who sings and dances with Temple. A substantial portion of the story is given over to Sara's abetting of an illicit romance between an under- teacher and the school's riding master, dramatized in an elaborate fairy-tale dream sequence. * 1995 American version: Liesel Matthews as Sara and Eleanor Bron as Miss Minchin, this adaptation notably differs from the original and more closely resembles the 1939 version, in that Sara's father is wounded and missing in action in wartime, and later is reunited with his daughter. Another difference is that it takes place in New York City during World War I instead of London during the Boer War, and the character of Becky, canonically Cockney, is recast as African-American.

Founded in 1846, the activities of the EA aim to promote evangelical Christian beliefs in government, media and society. The EA is based in London, with offices in Cardiff, Glasgow and Belfast. History The Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1846 by Ridley Haim Herschell, Rev. Edward Steane - a Baptist pastor from Camberwell - John Henderson and Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet.Rosemary Chadwick, ‚ÄòSteane, Edward (1798‚Äì1882)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 July 2014 Eardley became the organisation's first chairperson, leading the Alliance in its various campaigns for religious freedom; in 1852, Eardley campaigned on behalf of the Tuscan prisoners of conscience Francesco Madiai and Rosa Madiai,John Wolffe, ‚ÄòEardley, Sir Culling Eardley, third baronet (1805‚Äì1863)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 July 2014 who had been imprisoned for their Protestant faith. Overview The Evangelical Alliance works across 79 different denominations of Christianity, 750 organisations, and has 3,300 member churches. It is also includes and is linked to a number of separate Christian organisations, such as the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) \\\\- of which it was a founding member - Tearfund, an organisation originally established by the Alliance, and the World Council of Churches, after it announced plans for closer co-operation in January 2015. Other member organisations of the EA include Hope 08, Fusion and Serving In Mission (SIM). The Evangelical Alliance's CEO is Gavin Calver, replacing Steve Clifford in July 2019. Peter Lynas is the Alliance's UK Director, with Fred Drummond acting as Director of Scotland and Si√¢n Rees as Director of Wales. A number of Members of Parliament are associated with the Alliance, mainly through the Conservative Party; Conservative MP and former Conservative Party leadership candidate Stephen Crabb is associated with the Alliance through Gweini (The Council of the Christian Voluntary Sector in Wales), and Conservative MP Stuart Anderson is associated with the Alliance through the Freedom Church. Conservative MP for Congleton Fiona Bruce is a member of the Evangelical Alliance; in 2010, Bruce faced accusations that the Alliance had assisted her in winning the seat of Congleton in the 2010 general election. Positions The Evangelical Alliance has historically supported ecumenism - the principle of unity between different church doctrines - with the Roman Catholic Church, an approach criticised by some as in direct contradiction to the beliefs of the Alliance's founders. In 2019, the Alliance supported the 'Thy Kingdom Come' initiative - an event organised by the Archbishops of York and Canterbury to bring more people to Christianity through a sustained period of prayer from the dates of the Feast of the Ascension to Pentecost annually. The Alliance is openly opposed to homosexuality and same-sex relationships, preaching sexual abstinence for those with same-sex attractions, with membership for openly lesbian and gay people open only to those who \\"come to see the need to be transformed\\" from their same-sex attraction.

The house is now a non-profit museum, with an admission fee charged for tours, as well as an active settlement house with programs for children. It was built for Captain John Turner and stayed with the family for three generations. The house Side view The earliest section of the House of the Seven Gables was built in 1668 for Capt. John Turner. It remained in his family for three generations, descending from John Turner II to John Turner III. Facing south towards Salem Harbor, it was originally a two-room, -story house with a projecting front porch and a massive central chimney. This portion now forms the middle of the house. Four windows of the original ground-floor room (which became a dining room) remain in the house's side wall. A few years later, a kitchen lean-to and a new north kitchen ell to the rear of the house were added. By 1676, Turner had added a spacious south (front) extension with its own chimney, containing a parlor on the ground floor, with a large bed chamber above it. Ceilings in this new wing are higher than the very low ceilings in older parts of the house. The new wing featured double casement windows and an overhang with carved pendants; it was capped with a three-gabled garret. In the first half of the 18th century, John Turner II remodeled the house in the new Georgian style, adding wood paneling and sash windows. These alterations are preserved, very early examples of Georgian decor. The House of the Seven Gables is one of the oldest surviving timber-framed mansion houses in continental North America, with 17 rooms and over including its large cellars. After John Turner III lost the family fortune, the house was acquired by the Ingersolls, who remodeled it again. Gables were removed, porches replaced, and Georgian trim added. Inspiration for Hawthorne Nathaniel Hawthorne, a relative of the Ingersolls, was infamous for being reclusive during his time living in Salem, in part because Hawthorne himself exaggerated his reputation. He occasionally played whist, for example, with his sister Louisa, his second cousin Susannah Ingersoll, and Ingersoll's adopted son Horace Connolly.Miller, Edwin Haviland. Salem is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991: 87. Hawthorne was occasionally entertained in the house by Susannah but, by Hawthorne's time, the house had only three gables after a renovation to match more current architectural trends.Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 296. His cousin told him the house's history, and showed him beams and mortises in the attic indicating locations of former gables. Hawthorne was more inspired by the way \\"seven gables\\" sounded than what the house looked like. As he wrote in a letter, \\"The expression was new and struck me forcibly... I think I shall make something of it.\\"Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 297. The idea inspired Hawthorne's novel The House of the Seven Gables. Hawthorne wrote of the house as if it were a living thing. It is described as such in the novel: \\"The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human countenance... It was itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and sombre reminisces. The deep projection of the section story gave the house a meditative look, that you could not pass it without the idea that it had secret to keep.\\"Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 293. In writing the book, Hawthorne compared the process to constructing an actual house. In January 1851, he wrote to his publisher James Thomas Fields that the book was nearly finished, \\"only I am hammering away a little on the roof, and doing a few odd jobs that were left incomplete.\\"Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1980: 353. He sent the finished manuscript to Fields by the end of the month.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 257. The House of the Seven Gables was published in April 1851.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 238. Horace Ingersoll, Susanna's adopted son, told Hawthorne a story of Acadian lovers that later inspired Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1847 poem Evangeline. Museum Before 1908‚Äì1910 restoration Same view in 1915 In 1908, the house was purchased by Caroline O. Emmerton, founder of the House of Seven Gables Settlement Association, and she restored it from 1908 to 1910 as a museum whose admission fees would support the association. Boston architect Joseph Everett Chandler supervised the restoration, which among other alterations reconstructed missing gables. In some cases historical authenticity was sacrificed in the interest of appealing to visitors, who expected the house to match the one Hawthorne described in his romantic novel. Thus, for example, Emmerton added a \\"cent-shop\\" resembling that operated by the author's fictional character Hepzibah Pyncheon. A representation of \\"Maule's Well\\" was added to the garden.Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 297. She also added what looks like a wood closet but has a false back. When opened, the back leads to a secret staircase which leads up to the attic. Many interesting features of the original mansion remain, including unusual forms of wall insulation, original beams and rafters, and extensive Georgian paneling. The Nathaniel Hawthorne Birthplace is now immediately adjacent to the House of the Seven Gables, and access to it is granted with the regular admission fee. Although it is indeed the house in which Hawthorne was born and lived to the age of four, the house was sited a few blocks away on Union Street when he inhabited it. In 1994, the Seamans Visitor Center was opened at the historic site. The visitor center was named in honor of the Seamans family; Donald C. Seamans was responsible for the building project when he was president of the House of the Seven Gables Settlement Association. On March 29, 2007, the House of the Seven Gables Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District.

The Board of Directors administers a number of the SSMU's policies, including its Conflict of Interest Policy, and ensures that the Executives are being held accountable to their fiduciary responsibilities. =General Assembly and Referendum= In addition to the SSMU Legislative Council and Executive Committee, a Fall and Winter general assembly and referendum period are held to adopt changes on behalf the society. General assemblies and referendums are open to the entire membership of the SSMU and referenda are the only mechanism for increasing student fees. Representation The society was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations which represented them federally until November 3, 2005 when the SSMU Council voted unanimously to withdraw their membership in CASA, citing CASA's inability to reform, and the absence of CASA from the nationwide 2005 campaign for a $4.9 Billion Dedicated Transfer for Post Secondary Education. Provincially the SSMU is not a member of any association or formal group. In a referendum vote ending November 8, 2006, the membership of SSMU voted to end its membership in the F√©d√©ration √©tudiante universitaire du Qu√©bec (FEUQ). In November 2006, just over one year after leaving CASA, SSMU Council voted to take out prospective membership in the Canadian Federation of Students. After a full year of prospective membership, when a referendum on joining was meant to occur, other member locals of the Canadian Federation of Students voted against extending SSMU's prospective membership. The SSMU is a founding member of the Table de concertation √©tudiante du Qu√©bec or Quebec Student Roundtable, a new provincial student group that is noted for its lack of membership fee or student levy. Clubs and Services The SSMU funds a variety of cultural, ethnic, academic, and social clubs and services. Of the over 200 clubs, dating back almost 100 years, the McGill Debating Union earns notoriety for some of its famous alumni, including singer and poet Leonard Cohen and author of the first draft of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights John Peters Humphrey. A sampling of the SSMU's services and clubs include Divest McGill, the Black Students' Network, Queer McGill, McGill First Aid Clinic, McGill Nightline, DriveSafe, TVMcGill, The Midnight Kitchen, and Players' Theatre. In addition, the SSMU funds Elections McGill, the independent body that runs SSMU Executive and student Senator elections. Elections McGill was one of the first Campus election organizations in Canada to use an online voting system. Building The SSMU leases and runs events out of the William Shatner University Centre building, renamed after the Star Trek hero in 1992 by a referendum vote. As the Shatner building is leased by the SSMU and belongs to the University, the new name remains unrecognized and the building is referred to as the University Centre by McGill administrators. The Shatner building includes offices, a ballroom, cafeteria space, and Gerts, the SSMU's student-run bar. As of September 2018, the William Shatner University Centre building closed for renovations. SSMU offices are currently located at 3471 Peel Street and 680 Sherbrooke Street West. History Opening of the McGill University Student Union building, 1906 SSMU was predated by the Alma Mater Society, which was in 1902-1903. The Society, however, had little responsibility and resources. SSMU was founded in 1908 by the McGill Debating Union. It was recognized as students' official representative body in the following year. McGill University began its existence with the Faculty of Medicine in 1829 and the Faculty of Arts in 1843. However, not until the beginning of the 1900s was there an association on campus to provide representation and social events for students. Before this time there were no dances, no debating societies, and no government lobbying organizations. The demands for such an organization began to increase with the growth of student-led activities at the turn of the century. In 1902-1903, the Alma Mater Society was born. Although it promoted activities and some publications, the Society had little responsibility and even less money. It was in 1908 that the Students' Society of McGill University was born. The following year, it was recognized as the single representative body for students at McGill. The Society was first established in order to coordinate the undergraduate activities of the university. In the words of John T. Hackett, the first President of the Students' Society: \\"Like most new forms of Government its 'raison d'√™tre' was found in abuses. The students had been brought into disrepute with the public. Their failure to meet their creditors in undergraduate enterprises, and their apparent acquiescence in the charges of vandalism which were periodically brought against them, rendered absolute the necessity of reform.\\" The solution was the Students' Society and its executive body, the Students' Executive Council. Although McGill University began to admit its first female students in 1884, women were not members of the SSMU until 1931. They had a parallel organization called the Women's Union. In 1965, SSMU had its first female president; Sharon Sholzberg. Following the founding congress of UGEQ in November 1964, the SSMU executive voted to leave the Canadian Union of Students and join UGEQ in late 1965. Two referendums to join UGEQ were defeated over the 1965-66 university year. In early 1967, SSMU finally joined UGEQ in a successful referendum. The move was deemed controversial among some English Canadians who saw UGEQ as a radical, separatist student union. The 1966-67 CUS President, Doug Ward, encouraged McGill students to join UGEQ since CUS no longer had any other members in Quebec. The SSMU grew and evolved after its inception. Its role expanded to include several clubs, to offer services, and to care for the University Centre (consisting at the time of a pub and a cafeteria). As enrollment increased throughout the century, so did students' demands. The association took steps to ensure its effectiveness. This included enlarging its Executive Council and creating new positions for students. As social issues on campus became more important and more complex, the SSMU demanded the right to represent students to the university administration. After many student protests, it finally got the opportunity to do so in 1968, by obtaining seats on the Board of Governors and the Senate. =Name Change= On October 21, 2010, at a bi-annual General Assembly, members of the SSMU voted to refer to the SSMU as the \\"Students' Society of the Educational Institute Roughly Bounded by Peel, Penfield, University, Sherbrooke and Mac Campus\\" or \\"SSTEIRBBPPUSAMC\\" for short. This name change was a satirical response to administrative pressures regarding the usage of \\"McGill University\\" in the title of student clubs and services due to liability concerns (e.g., TV McGill). Controversies =2006 Blood Drive Controversy= On November 2, 2006, SSMU decided to not allow blood drives to be held on their property due to the belief that H√©ma-Qu√©bec's lifetime ban against donations from men who have had sex with other men is in violation of the Student Society's constitution . In the Winter 2007 referendum period, students voted on whether or not to uphold the ban on blood drives. However, before the results could be announced, the Judicial Board (the appellate body of SSMU) issued an injunction sealing the results until they could rule on the constitutionality of the question being asked. The Judicial Board subsequently ruled that blood drives were unconstitutional, nullifying the results of the unsealed referendum. The unsealed referendum revealed more than two-thirds of students supported holding blood drives in the student building. =Choose Life club exclusion= The Students' Society Legislative Council narrowly passed a two-thirds secret ballot motion 16-7 in November 2009, setting a precedent and suspending the club status of controversial SSMU club Choose Life. The motion was the second of two Choose Life-related motions put forward that evening, the first of which, had it not failed, would have revoked Choose Life's club status entirely.SSMU council sets precedent; suspends Choose Life's club statusMcGill University Student Govt Suspends Club Status of Campus Pro-Life Group ='Farnan-gate' Controversy= In October 2013, Brian Farnan, then the VP of Internal Affairs for SSMU, sent out a weekly listserv email which included a doctored GIF image of US President Barack Obama kicking down a door with the caption \\"honestly midterms, get out of here.\\" Subsequently, an anonymous complaint was filed with SSMU's equity commission, and Farnan was compelled to publicly apologize for purportedly carrying out the microaggression of perpetuating negative African-American stereotypes. Backlash manifested itself both on campus and beyond as a result of the apology, which gained the attention of national media and was dubbed 'Farnan- gate' by campus media. SSMU's equity policy was heavily criticized and placed under review as a result. In March 2014, SSMU moved to officially rescind its motion mandating Farnan's apology, releasing a statement which acknowledged the \\"unnecessary and excessively punitive\\" perception of the apology and stated it had \\"trivialized racism.\\" See also *List of Quebec students' associations *McGill Martlets *McGill Redmen  References  External links *Union for Gender Empowerment Web Site * *McGill First Year Committee of Council (FYCC) *McGill Daily *McGill Tribune *TVMcGill *University Site Category:McGill University McGill Category:Quebec students' associations Category:Student government ","title":"Students' Society of McGill University"},{"id":"1164397","text":"Blaxland can refer to: People * Gregory Blaxland (1778‚Äì1853), pioneer farmer and explorer in Australia, brother of John * Jasper Blaxland (1880‚Äì1963), English consultant surgeon * John Blaxland (explorer), pioneer settler and explorer in Australia, brother of Gregory Blaxland (1778‚Äì1853) * John Blaxland (politician) (1799‚Äì1884), member of NSW Legislative Council, a son of Gregory Blaxland (1778‚Äì1853) * John Blaxland (historian), Australian historian and academic Other uses * Blaxland, New South Wales, a small town * Division of Blaxland, a NSW electoral district in the Australian House of Representatives * Blaxland, Queensland, a locality in the Western Downs Region See also * Blaxlands Ridge, New South Wales, a suburb near Sydney ","title":"Blaxland"},{"id":"1164400","text":"Blaxland is a town in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.

History Blaxland is named for Gregory Blaxland who along with William Lawson and William Wentworth, led the exploration that discovered a route over the Blue Mountains in 1813. Prior to 1879 the area was known as Wascoe. The Pilgrim Inn was built c. 1825. It was a significant element in the area for some time, but eventually decayed. The remains, which are now adjacent to McDonald's, are heritage-listed.State Heritage Register The Rev. Joshua Hargrave became a major presence in the area in the early 20th. century, and a significant force in the growth of Blaxland as a village, especially South Blaxland. He built the first church in the area and, with his family and the Calver family, is associated with four homes that still survive: Tanfield in Hope Street, Menahne in Hope Street, Rosedale in View Street and Nardi in View Street.

It is immediately south-west of the dormant volcano Mount Tarawera, and its geography was substantially altered by a major 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Along with the mountain, it lies within the Okataina caldera. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"warm lake\\" for , following Hochstetter. Before the 1886 eruption, only two small lakes were present in the current lake's basin. Following the eruption, a number of craters filled over the course of 15 years to form today's Lake Rotomahana. It is the most recently formed larger natural lake in New Zealand, and the deepest in the Rotorua district. The lake's northern shore lies close to the lower Lake Tarawera, separated by less than of terrain that is mostly material from the 1886 eruption. Lake Rotomahana has no natural outlet, and its water level varies by about one meter in response to rainfall and evaporation.Information panel at Lake Rotomahana's shore The lake is a wildlife refuge (and was one prior to first contact), with all hunting of birds prohibited. A healthy population of black swan inhabits the lake, and there are efforts underway to ensure the lake's largest island, Patiti Island, is kept pest-free. Recent research confirms Patiti Island is the closest surviving pre-eruption feature on the old lake, i.e. to survive the 1886 eruption, being formerly known as Rangipakaru Hill.Bunn R (2020) Commentary: Locating Relict Sinter Terrace Sites at Lake Rotomahana, New Zealand, With Ferdinand von Hochstetter‚Äôs Legacy Cartography, Historic Maps, and LIDAR. Front. Earth Sci. 8:68. doi: 10.3389/feart.2020.00068 There is no public access to the lake, save for the Tourist Track, overland from Lake Tarawera. A boat cruise on the lake, visiting hydrothermal features on the lake's shore, is available as an additional extra from the Waimangu Volcanic Valley tourism operation. Pink and White Terraces The Pink and White Terraces were a natural wonder on the shores of the lake before the 1886 eruption. They were considered to be the eighth wonder of the natural world and were New Zealand's most famous tourist attraction during the 19th century, from c. 1870-1886; but were buried or destroyed by the eruption. Scientists thought they had rediscovered the lower tiers of the Pink and White Terraces on the lake bed at a depth of in 2011. More recent research reports over 2016-2020 suggest the upper parts of both terraces lie on land and may therefore be accessed for physical evidence the terraces or sections of them survived in their original locations.Bunn R (2020) Commentary: Locating Relict Sinter Terrace Sites at Lake Rotomahana, New Zealand, With Ferdinand von Hochstetter‚Äôs Legacy Cartography, Historic Maps, and LIDAR. Front. Earth Sci. 8:68. doi: 10.3389/feart.2020.00068 The 2017- research relied on the journals of German-Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who visited the lake in 1859. Hochstetter's journals are the only known survey of the terraces before the eruption. Using Hochstetter's field diaries and compass data, a team of New Zealand researchers identified a location where they believe the Pink and White Terraces lie preserved at a depth of 10‚Äì15 metres (32‚Äì49 ft). The researchers were hoping to raise funds for a full survey of the area, but any work would first have to be approved by the local Maori tribe on whose sacred ancestral land the Pink and White Terraces are situated. Ground penetrating radar searches were undertaken in 2017 but the equipment failed to penetrate sufficiently deeply to show whether or not the Terraces lay in their surveyed locations. Later Hochstetter survey research refined the Pink, Black and White Terrace locations.Bunn, A. R. (2019). Hochstetter‚Äôs survey of the Pink and White Terraces: the final iteration. Surveying+Spatial 99, 30‚Äì35. Green Lake A small lake, Green Lake, lies close to the eastern shore of Lake Rotomahana at . It should not be confused by the much larger Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), which lies to the west of Rotomahana. Green Lake was formed in a roughly circular crater and is some 100 metres in diameter. It takes its name from its distinctive colour, which is considerably greener and darker than that of Rotomahana. The lake formed after the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Prior to the eruption, a small (~12m diameter) lakelet also known as Green Lake (Lake Rotopounamu) had existed to the north of Lake Rotomahana in Waikanapanapa Valley but this was exhumed during the Tarawera eruption. After the eruption, water flowed into the new Green Lake crater, which was given the same name as the older lake.Cole, J. W., (1970) \\"Structure and eruptive history of the Tarawera volcanic complex\\", New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics 13, 4. pp. 879‚Äì902. Other pre-eruption lakes and lakelets about Lake Rotomahana included Lakes Rotomakariri, Rangipakaru, Ruahoata and Wairake. The shape, location and orientation of Lake Makariri in Cole, 1970 (cited herein) is incorrect. He followed August Petermann's flawed map. Hochstetter shows the lake axis lay at an azimuth of 355 degrees. Recent research into these lake levels gave insight into changes at Lake Rotomahana in the lead-up to the eruption.  The Sunken Totara Forest Myth  One forgotten lake feature is the semi-mythical sunken totara forest of Lake Rotomahana. In 2016 when a scuba team first dove the lake, they found no evidence of a sunken forest or trees, as reported by Fitzgerald off Moura.Bunn, A. R. Quest for the Pink and White Terraces, rushes, 7.30-8.30, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9YHJjPTrX8, uploaded 6/5/2016. While there were forests over the pre-eruption Mt Tarawera, Totara trees were scattered and only recorded over the western and southern mountain flanks. Given Totara tree groves could hardly appear in the eruption craters; it appears likely any sunken forest lies in the north-east corner of the new lake. The placement of the sunken forest would have been post-eruption, via the mechanism described by the US Forest Service after the Mt. St. Helens eruption.Walker, T. (2017) ‚ÄúLearning the Lessons of Mount St Helens‚Äù, Creation 39, 3, 26 The trees were uprooted in the eruption and propelled into the crater during or after the eruption. As the new lake formed over decades, the trunks floated for a time, then tipped vertically; later descending into a vertical lie, and became embedded into the lake floor coming to resemble a sunken forest. Hence, another myth about the Tarawera eruption and Lake Rotomahana is explained.

History In 1982, Baltimore-based comics retailer Steve Geppi founded Diamond Comic Distributors. Diamond became the successor to direct market pioneer Phil Seuling's distribution dream when it took over New Media/Irjax's warehouses in 1982. Diamond further bought out early-distributor Bud Plant Inc. in 1988, and main rival Capital City Distribution in 1996, to assume a near-monopoly on comics distribution, including exclusivity deals with the major comic book publishers. = Beginnings = By 1981/82 Geppi had four comics retail locations and was already \\"doing a little informal distributing... for smaller retailers.\\"Warshaw, Michael with illustration by Neal Adams, \\"From Mailman to Tycoon,\\" Success (June, 1994), pp. 28‚Äì32 Geppi found himself \\"one of the biggest accounts\\" for New Media/Irjax, and when the distributor \\"relocated to Florida, he asked Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount.\\" One of the \\"last loyal customers\\" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal: \\"[t]he owner was going into retail,\\" so Geppi agreed to provide New Media/Irjax with \\"free books for a period of time in return for his account list,\\" buying parts of the company, and founding Diamond Comic Distribution. Geppi had been a sub-distributor for Hal Shuster's Irjax in the late 1970s.Duin, Steve and Richardson, Mike (ed.s) \\"Direct Distribution\\" in Comics Between the Panels (Dark Horse Publishing, 1998) , p. 126-130 In what Mile High Comics' Chuck Rozanski describes as an \\"incredibly risky and gutsy move,\\" Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's \\"office and warehouse space\\" and, recalled Rozanski, had to \\"sort out the good customers from the bad overnight\\" negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution. Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, \\"[h]e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place.\\" Geppi named his new company 'Diamond' \\"after the imprint Marvel Comics used on non- returnable comics,\\" and although the \\"publisher discontinued the symbol\\" months later, the name remained. \\"Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year,\\" as comics retail took off. In 1983, Diamond hired an accounting firm, and in 1985 hired \\"no-nonsense CPA\\" Chuck Parker \\"as Diamond's first controller\\". In 1994, Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Geppi's \\"best decision\\", as Parker \\"cares nothing about the comics. To him, it's dollars and cents.\\" Parker describes his role as \\"smooth[ing] the emotion out of some decisions. Steve [Geppi] is a visionary and a risk-taker... and I tend to be more conservative.\\" =Expansion= After starting his business through buying New Media/Irjax's warehouses and offices in 1982, Geppi's distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since. Many fans \\"with little experience\\" started rival distribution companies only to \\"find they were in over their heads,\\" allowing Geppi to \\"[buy] out the smart ones or pick... up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business,\\" according to Herr. Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves. In the early 1980s, Marvel and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems, effectively \\"play[ing] into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond,\\" and hastening the demise of smaller distributors. In 1988, Previews, Diamond's monthly magazine showcasing upcoming comic books was first published.  Bud Plant Inc.  Most notably, in 1988, Geppi bought up early mail-order distributor Bud Plant Inc.,\\"Bud Plant Sells Out to Diamond,\\" The Comics Journal #124 (August 1988), pp. 9-10. who had himself bought out Charles Abar Distribution in 1982.Duin, Steve and Richardson, Mike (ed.s) \\"Bud Plant\\" in Comics Between the Panels (Dark Horse Publishing, 1998) , p. 356-357 Plant had, since 1970, been selling underground comics (a field which Geppi and fellow distributor Buddy Saunders had tended to steer clear of).

He went on to work for the Yorkshire Evening Post, the Yorkshire Post, latterly as Northern industrial correspondent (1952‚Äì1961), and The Guardian (1962‚Äì1967). While a reporter at the Yorkshire Post, Ingham was an active member of the National Union of Journalists, and vice chairman of its Leeds branch. He is also likely to have been the anonymous and aggressively anti-Conservative columnist \\"Albion\\" for the Leeds Weekly Citizen ‚Äì a Labour Party organ ‚Äì from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, he joined the Civil Service, working as a press and public relations officer and director of Information in various Government departments, including the Department of Energy, 1974‚Äì77, where he also served as Under-Secretary in the Energy Conservation Division, 1978‚Äì79.Janus: The Papers of Sir Bernard Ingham http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FINGH;sib0=216 Ingham's father was a Labour Party councillor for Hebden Royd Town Council and he was himself a member of the Labour Party until he joined the Civil Service. Ingham contested the then safe Conservative Moortown ward of Leeds City Council in the 1965 council elections for the Labour Party, having been nominated by the Fabian Society. Ingham is of both Yorkshire and Lancashire lineage.Practical Family History magazine, September 2006, No 105, pages 6‚Äì10; A Foot in Both Red & White Rose Camps; the family tree of Sir Bernard Ingham by Roy Stockdill The Inghams originally came from Manchester and Salford, but Ingham's grandfather Henry Ingham moved to the Calder Valley and Hebden Bridge. On his maternal side, Ingham's ancestors were mostly from Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall, while his maternal grandmother Jane Vernon descended from Staffordshire coal miners. Press secretary to Margaret Thatcher Ingham spent 11 years as Margaret Thatcher's chief press secretary in No. 10 Downing Street when she was Prime Minister. In 1989‚Äì90 he was also head of the Government Information Office. In the course of his civil service career he was also press secretary to Barbara Castle, Robert Carr, Maurice Macmillan, Lord Carrington, Eric Varley and Tony Benn. Although a career civil servant, Ingham gained a reputation for being a highly effective propagandist for the Thatcherite cause. The phrase spin doctor did not enter common parlance until after his retirement, but he was nevertheless considered a gifted exponent in what came to be known as the \\"black arts\\" of spin. In those days, Downing Street briefings were \\"off the record\\", meaning that information given out by Ingham could be attributed only to \\"senior government sources\\". Occasionally he used this deniability to brief against the government's own ministers, such as when he described the leader of the House of Commons John Biffen as a \\"semi-detached\\" member of the government. Biffen was dropped at the next reshuffle. This blurring of the distinction between his nominally neutral role as a civil servant and a more partisan role as apologist and promoter of Margaret Thatcher's policies led Christopher Hitchens to characterise Ingham as \\"a nugatory individual\\" and to criticise what he saw as the negative consequences of Ingham's time as Thatcher's press secretary: \\"During his time in office, Fleet Street took several steps towards an American system of Presidentially-managed coverage and sound-bite deference, without acquiring any of the American constitutional protection in return.\\" In 1987 Downing Street berated The Sun newspaper in a storm over honours. Thatcher was said to be furious, and Ingham, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, sent correspondence to The Sun asking it to explain why the honours list, given in confidence, had been published. From the archive, 31 December 1987: Downing Street berates Sun in honours storm  From the Guardian  The Guardian  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/31/archive-1987-sun-honours- storm In 1989, three years after the Westland helicopter scandal led to the resignation of Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, former cabinet minister Leon Brittan revealed in a Channel 4 programme that Ingham was one of two senior Downing Street officials who had approved the leaking of a crucial letter from the Solicitor General Patrick Mayhew, in which he questioned some of the statements that Heseltine had made about the takeover contest of the Westland helicopter company. Brittan's claim that Ingham and Charles Powell had approved the leak of the letter led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair. Ingham was knighted on Thatcher's resignation ‚Äì and retirement ‚Äì in 1990. His successor as press secretary was Gus O'Donnell, who went on to become Cabinet secretary and head of the Civil service in 2005.Gus O'Donnell http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/people/visiting-professors/gus-odonnell Ingham's book Kill the Messenger, concerning his time as press secretary, was not well received. Paul Foot, a Marxist journalist, commented that \\"... there is no information in this book. I picked it up eagerly, refusing to believe that someone so close to the top for so long could fail to reveal, even by mistake, a single interesting piece of information\\" and he was particularly scathing about Ingham's prose style, offering the following quotation from Kill the Messenger as representative of Ingham's use of English: \\"Like a mighty oak, it took more than one axe to bring Mrs Thatcher down. In November 1990 they were cutting into this solid timber from all angles. The frenzy was fearsome to behold. Heaven preserve us from political axe-men in a state of panic. They would cut off their grandmas in their prime if they thought it would serve their interests. And so they cut off a grandma in her international prime by the stocking tops, to borrow one of Denis's phrases, which Mrs Thatcher often used.\\" In a commentary in the Daily Express in April 2009, Ingham referred to Thatcher as \\"reckless\\" and a battler for Britain. He said her greatest quality was that she did not want to be loved and she came to office without a Press Secretary and had \\"the enormous will\\" to overcome \\"defeatist inertia\\", such as: \\"Oh you can't do that Prime Minister, they won't allow it\\".

Controversies =Court case= On 8 March 1999, Ingham was bound over to keep the peace at Croydon Magistrates' Court after he was accused of causing criminal damage to a Mercedes car owned by Linda Cripps, a neighbour, in Purley, south London. The charges were dropped when Ingham agreed to accept being bound over for 12 months in the sum of ¬£1,000 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Ingham denied that he had caused any damage to the vehicle. The court was told that Cripps told Ingham: \\"You have damaged my car\\", to which he replied \\"Good, I'm glad\\". Ingham denied he had damaged the car and said, \\"I did not cause the damage complained of and to resolve the issue I accepted advice that I should agree to be bound over. I have paid ¬£792 to cover the cost of the alleged damage to the car.\\" Cripps's husband said after the case \\"We are weary of the constant bombardment that we have suffered. We are no match for Sir Bernard Ingham. Let's hope that he will now allow us to get on with our lives peacefully\\". =Hillsborough= In a letter addressed to a parent of a victim of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, Ingham reiterated his belief that the disaster was caused by \\"tanked up yobs\\", a view later entirely refuted by the Hillsborough inquest. In a letter written to a Liverpool FC supporter, Ingham remarked that people should \\"shut up about Hillsborough\\". In 1996 on Question Time, Ingham spoke with what a member of the Hillsborough Independent Panel considered to be \\"hate in his voice\\" in favour of compensating the police present at the time of the disaster, saying: \\"If thousands of ticketless fans had not turned up and pushed their way into the ground then the whole scenario would not have occurred.\\" \\"You can't get away from what you were told,\\" Ingham said. \\"We talked to a lot of people; I am not sure if it was the chief constable.

He has been cartoon editor of The Spectator since 1991. Biography Heath was born on 13 October 1935, in Bloomsbury, London. His father, George Heath, was also a cartoonist of boy's adventure comics, a job he detested. Heath's relationship with both his parents was distant and neither birthdays nor Christmas were celebrated. During the war Heath was evacuated to his grandmother's house in Torcross, in Devon. In 1947 the family moved to Brighton. While studying at art college, which he loathed, Heath sold his first cartoons to Melody Maker for two guineas. He later got work illustrating album covers for Decca Records and drew a strip called \\"Nelly Know-all\\" for the Women's Sunday Mirror. By the 1960s he was part of the Soho social crowd that included Jeffrey Bernard, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon. His work has appeared in numerous British publications including Punch, Lilliput, the Evening Standard, The Evening News, The Guardian, The Spectator, The Independent, The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday, and Private Eye; all his work is signed simply as \\"HEATH\\". He has been cartoon editor of The Spectator since 1991, and the cartoons which are published have not always adhered to the magazine's conservative politics. Heath's own political cartoons have also appeared in The Independent. In August 2016 he was the guest for the long-running BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs. His favourite choice was \\"Criss Cross\\" by Thelonious Monk. His other choices were \\"Dance of the Infidels\\" by Bud Powell, \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\" by Henry Hall & His Orchestra, \\"Max In An Air Raid (I Never Slept A Wink All Night)\\" by Max Miller, \\"Take a Step\\" by Jack Buchanan, \\"All the Things You Are\\" by The Quintet, \\"Funny Face\\" by Fred and Adele Astaire, with Julian Jones & His Orchestra and \\"Lover\\" by Charlie Parker. His book choice was The Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith and his luxury item was an artist's painting set. Heath has been married three times, the first time for 32 years, the second time for 18 years. He has four daughters in total, two from each of his first two marriages. He kept a black and tan Dachshund, named Charlie, Charlie was gifted to his daughter daisy when she was 11, for many years until he died in August 2019.

Cooney that was first published in 1990. The first in the five- part Janie Johnson series, it was later adapted into a film for television. The book is about a 15-year-old girl named Janie Johnson, who starts to suspect that her parents may have kidnapped her and that her biological parents are somewhere in New Jersey. These suspicions come after Janie recognizes a picture of herself on a milk carton under the heading \\"Missing Child.\\" Janie's life gets more stressful as she tries to find the truth while hiding the secret from her parents. The idea for the novel originated from the regular practice in the 1980s and 1990s for milk cartons to feature photographs of missing children. The Face on the Milk Carton, which contains themes including the exploration of self-identity, relationships with parents and peers, and individual responsibility, has been used in young adult classrooms to encourage readers to explore these themes in their own lives. The book was number 79 on the most frequently challenged books in the US for 1990-1999 and number 29 for 2000-2009 for references to kidnapping, cults, challenges to authority, and sexual activity. The book has also receive several awards, including the Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award (1996) and the Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers Choice Award (1993).  Summary While at lunch on a typical day of school, Janie Johnson‚Äôs life is upended after she picks up a friend‚Äôs milk carton and recognizes herself as the girl in a missing persons photo on the back of the carton. The child is identified as ‚ÄòJennie Spring,‚Äô a girl who was kidnapped from a New Jersey shopping mall when she was three years old. Although Janie refuses to believe that her loving parents could have kidnapped her, she begins having flashbacks that do not fit in with her current life. This leads Janie to search her home‚Äôs attic for any information that could shed light on her flashbacks. After finding school papers with the name 'Hannah Javensen' and the dress worn by the girl on the milk carton, Janie confronts her parents. Her parents explain that Hannah is their daughter, and that Janie is Hannah's daughter. According to her parents, Hannah was a confused teen who had joined a cult at a young age and was married off to one of the men in her cult. One day, Hannah showed up at the Johnson's house with Janie, and left her there before returning to the cult. The Johnsons, fearing the cult might want Janie back, fled the state and changed their name from 'Javensen' to 'Johnson.' Janie, relieved her parents are not kidnappers, concludes that her flashbacks are from her life in the cult before coming to the Johnson's. Despite her relief, Janie struggles to forget the picture on the milk carton and her flashbacks, and begins researching the Jennie Spring kidnapping. Discrepancies between her research and her parents' story leads her to suspect that her parents may have actually kidnapped her. Although she still loves them and wants to forgive them, Janie decides to further investigate the kidnapping. Along with her boyfriend Reeve, Janie goes to New Jersey to find the Spring family. In New Jersey, they discover that the entire family has the same red hair that Janie has, which neither Mr. and Mrs. Johnson or even Hannah has. Unsure of what to do, Janie writes the Spring family a letter, but hesitates to mail it. Finally, Janie asks her parents what to do about the letter, and confronts them with what she has learned. A shocked Mr. and Mrs. Johnson reason that Hannah must have kidnapped Janie, and insist, against Janie's wishes, that they call the Springs. The book ends with Janie calling the New Jersey family.  Background  According to an interview with The Atlantic, Cooney‚Äôs inspiration came to her at LaGuardia airport, where she saw missing child flyers, including one of a toddler, posted throughout the concourse. The posters struck her, and led her to imagine what it might be like if a toddler recognized herself on a poster. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, it was regular practice for milk cartons to feature photographs of missing children. The practice began after a series of high-profile child kidnappings by noncustodial parents in the late 1970s led to renewed attention on law enforcement‚Äôs tendency to neglect cases that involved children staying with noncustodial parents. Widespread dissatisfaction with this practice prompted a campaign for law enforcement to pursue all missing children cases more aggressively.  Genre and style  The Face on the Milk Carton, similarly to many of Cooney‚Äôs novels, is a young adult mystery and suspense novel. The recommended age range is 12 and up.  Analysis  Authors John Bushman and Shelley McNerny, who specialize in analyzing young adult literature, recognize The Face on the Milk Carton, along with several other young adult novels, as a text that instructors can use to guide the development of young adults‚Äô moral reasoning. This is because the novel contains a variety of themes, including the exploration of self-identity, relationships with parents and peers, and individual responsibility, that will challenge readers to examine the dynamics that the novel‚Äôs protagonist faces in the context of their own lives. In her article ‚ÄúMirrors and Windows,‚Äù editor Kim Ford lists The Face on the Milk Carton as one of her thirty recommended books, as a young adult favorite, to put on a ‚Äúgood book‚Äù shelf. Ford further notes that many of the most popular books among young adults, including The Face on the Milk Carton, are those that are both ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù and ‚Äúwindows,‚Äù or books that allow readers to see and understand themselves in the novels‚Äô characters.  Publication  The Face on the Milk Carton was first published in 1990 by Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young Readers. The last book of the series, Janie Face to Face, was published in January 2014.  Reception  The Face on the Milk Carton has been the recipient of several awards, including the Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award (1996), Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers Choice Award (1993), and Iowa Teen Book Award (1993). Cumulatively, the series has sold over 4.2 million copies. The novel has also faced challenges for its mature content. The book was number 79 on the most frequently challenged books in the US for 1990-1999 and number 29 for 2000-2009 for references to kidnapping, cults, and sexual activity. One scene that has drawn particular criticism involves Janie‚Äôs boyfriend pressuring her to have sex, despite her clear reluctance and anxiety from dealing with her family situation. Although she is visibly upset, he kisses her and feels her up.

It is native to Africa and the Middle East. It is especially known for its role in the religion of the Ancient Egyptians, where it was linked to the god Thoth.  Taxonomy  It is very closely related to the black-headed ibis and the Australian white ibis, with which it forms a superspecies complex, so much so that the three species are considered conspecific by some ornithologists. In mixed flocks these ibises often hybridise. The Australian white ibis is often called the sacred ibis colloquially. Although known to the ancient civilisations of Greece, Rome and especially Africa, ibises were unfamiliar to western Europeans from the fall of Rome until the 19th century, and mentions of this bird in the ancient works of these civilisations were supposed to describe some type of curlew or other bird, and were thus translated as such. In 1758, Linnaeus was convinced that the ancient authors were describing a cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), which he thus described as Ardea ibis. Following the work of Mathurin Jacques Brisson, who calls it Ibis candida in 1760, in the 12th edition of his Systema Naturae of 1766 Linnaeus classifies it as Tantalus ibis. These were also unfamiliar birds that did not occur in Europe at the time, in English in these times called the 'Egyptian ibis' by Latham, and the 'emseesy' or 'ox-bird' by George Shaw. In 1790, John Latham provided the first unambiguous modern scientific description of the sacred ibis as Tantalus aethiopicus, mentioning James Bruce of Kinnaird who called it 'abou hannes' in his writings describing his travels in Sudan and Ethiopia, and also described Tantalus melanocephalus of India. Georges Cuvier named it Ibis religiosus in his Le R√®gne Animal of 1817. In 1842, George Robert Gray reclassified the bird under the new genus Threskiornis, because the type of the genus Tantalus was designated as to be the wood stork, also formerly known as the wood ibis or wood pelican, and Gray decided these birds could not be classified in the same genus. In a comprehensive review of plumage patterns by Holyoak in 1970, it was noted that the three taxa were extremely similar and that the Australian birds resembled Threskiornis aethiopicus in adult plumage and T. melanocephalus in juvenile plumage, he thus proposed they all be considered part of a single species T. aethiopicus. At the time this was generally accepted by the scientific community, however in 'The Birds of the Western Palearctic' compendium of 1977, Roselaar advocated splitting the group into 4 species, recognising T. bernieri, based again on the then known geographical morphological differences. In 1990, Sibley & Monroe, in the general reference 'Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World' followed Roselaar in recognising four species, which they repeated in 'A World Checklist of Birds' of 1993. This taxon being split from T. melanocephalus and T. molucca was further advocated by another morphological study by Lowe and Richards in 1991, where, like Holyoak, they looked at plumage again but used much more skins, but unlike him concluded that the differences were such to merit separate species status for the three taxa, especially as they could find no intergradation in morphological characters in possible contact zones in SE Asia. They also cite purported differences in courtship displays between the Australian and Asian birds. Based on these characteristics they recommended the Malagasy birds be considered a subspecies of T. aethiopicus. In 2003, Birdlife International elected to adopt the narrow taxonomic concept as advocated in Sibley & Monroe 1993.  Description  Flying in South Africa An adult individual is long with all-white body plumage apart from dark plumes on the rump. Wingspan is and body weight . Males are generally slightly larger than females. The bald head and neck, thick curved bill and legs are black. The white wings show a black rear border in flight. The eyes are brown with a dark red orbital ring. Sexes are similar, but juveniles have dirty white plumage, a smaller bill and some feathering on the neck, greenish-brown scapulars and more black on the primary coverts. This bird is usually silent, but occasionally makes puppy- like yelping noises, unlike its vocal relative, the hadada ibis.  Distribution  = Native = The sacred ibis breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa and southeastern Iraq. A number of populations are migrant with the rains; some of the South African birds migrate 1,500 km as far north as Zambia, the African birds north of the equator migrate in the opposite direction. The Iraqi population usually migrates to southwestern Iran, but wandering vagrants have been seen as far south as Oman (rare, but regular) and as far north as the Caspian coasts of Kazakhstan and Russia (before 1945).  Africa  It was formerly found in North Africa including Kemet, where it was commonly venerated and mummified as a votive offering to the god Thoth. For many centuries until the Roman period the main temples buried a few dozen of thousands of birds a year, and to sustain sufficient numbers for the demand for sacrifices by pilgrims from all over Egypt, dozens of ibis breeding farms (called ibiotropheia by Herodotus) were established, initially throughout Egypt, but later centralised around the main temples, each producing around a thousand mummies annually.Wasef, Sally A. (2016); \\"Ancient Egyptian Sacred Ibis Mummies: Evolutionary Mitogenomics Resolves the History of Ancient Farming\\". Thesis (PhD Doctorate); Griffith University; Brisbane Aristotle mentions in c. 350 BC that many sacred ibises are found all over Egypt. Strabo, writing around 20 AD, mentions large amounts of the birds in the streets of Alexandria, where he was living at the time; picking through the trash, attacking provisions, and defiling everything with their dung. Pierre Belon notes the many ibises in Egypt during his travels there in the late 1540s (he thought they were an odd type of stork). Beno√Æt de Maillet, in his Description de l'Egypte (1735) relates that at the turn of the 17th century, when the great caravans travelled yearly to Mecca, great clouds of ibises would follow them from Egypt for over a hundred leagues into the desert to feed on the dung left at the encampments. By 1850, however, the species had disappeared from Egypt both as a breeding and migrant population, with the last, albeit questionable, sighting in 1864. The species did not breed in southern Africa before the beginning of the 20th century, but it has benefited from irrigation, dams, and commercial agricultural practices such as dung heaps, carrion and refuse tips. It began to breed in the early 20th century, and in the 1970s the first colonies of ibises were recorded in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Its population for example expanded 2-3-fold during the period between 1972‚Äì1995 in Orange Free State. It is now found throughout southern Africa. The species is a common resident in most parts of South Africa. Local numbers are swollen in summer by individuals migrating southwards from the equator. Elsewhere in Africa it occurs throughout the continent south of the Sahara, but it is largely absent in the deserts of southwestern Africa (i.e. the Namib, the Karoo, the Kalahari) and probably the rainforests of the Congo. In west Africa it is fairly uncommon across the Sahel, except for the major floodplain systems. It can commonly found breeding along the Niger, in the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, the Logone of C.A.R., Lac Fitri in Chad, the Saloum Delta of Senegal, and other localities in relatively small numbers such as in The Gambia. It is common across eastern Africa and southern Africa. Large numbers can be found in the Sudd swamps and Lake Kundi in Sudan in the dry season. It is fairly widespread along the upper Nile River, and is quite common around Mogadishu, Somalia. In Tanzania there are a number of sites with 500 to 1,000+ birds, totalling some 20,000 birds.  Asia  The bird is also native to Yemen; in 2003 it bred in large numbers on small islands near Haramous and along the Red Sea coast near Hodeidah and Aden, where it was often found at waste-water treatment plants. It has been recorded nesting on a shipwreck in the Red Sea. It is also seen as a vagrant on Socotra. With the current war and famine, there have been no new census reports on the species in Yemen, however an estimate of approximately 30 mature individuals was given in 2015. The species was fairly common in Iraq in the first half of the 20th century, but by the late 1960s it had become very scarce, with the population thought to number no more than 200 birds. The population was thought to have suffered greatly during the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes of southeastern Iraq starting in the late 1980s, and feared to have disappeared entirely, but it has continuously been observed breeding in a colony in the Hawizeh Marshes (a part of the Mesopotamian Marshes) as of 2008, numbering up to 27 adults. It is also native to Kuwait, where it occurs as an extremely rare migrant, with only two known sightings, the last being a flock of 17 in 2007. There are no records of the bird in Iran before the 1970s, however small numbers were found overwintering in Khuzestan in 1970. Since the 1990s numbers appear to have slowly increased to a few dozen. = Introduced = The first African sacred ibises brought to Europe were two imported from Egypt to France in the mid-1700s. In the 1800s the first escapes were sighted in Europe (in Austria, Italy). In the 1970s it became fashionable for many zoos in Europe and elsewhere to keep their birds in free-flying colonies, which were allowed to forage in the area but would return to roost in the zoo every day. As such feral populations were established in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, the Canary Islands, Florida, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and possibly Bahrain. Some studies indicate that the introduced populations in Europe have significant economic and ecological impacts, while others suggest that they constitute no substantial threat to native European bird species.  Europe  In France the African sacred ibises have become established along its Atlantic coast following the feral breeding of birds which were the offspring of a large free-flying population originating from the Branf√©r√© Zoological Gardens in southern Brittany. The first successful breeding was in 1993 at two sites, the Golfe du Morbihan and Lac de Grand-Lieu, and respectively from Branf√©r√©. By 2005 the Atlantic French breeding population was estimated at 1,100 pairs and winter censuses led to an estimated total population of up to 3,000 birds. A separate population originated from a zoo at Sigean on the Mediterranean coast of France and by 2005 the colony at the Etang de Bages-et Sigean was estimated at 250 pairs. A cull was begun and by 2011 the population had fallen to 560‚Äì600 pairs. By January 2017 the eradication programme had lowered the number of birds in roosts in western France to 300‚Äì500 birds and the Lac de Grand-Lieu was the only regular breeding site in the region; as the programme has progressed the birds have become warier and the reduced numbers mean the effort and cost per bird has increased and complete eradication may never be achieved. The population near Sigean was eradicated by killing and capturing the birds with only a few remaining in the Camargue. This species is not considered established in mainland Spain. The Barcelona Zoo kept a small free-flying population which bred in the zoo and at least once in 1974 in the surrounding city park. Between 1983 and 1985 they had increased to 18 birds, but these subsequently declined to 4‚Äì6 pairs in the 1990s and the birds were permanently caged by the end of the 1990s (the zoo still has some). In 2001 the remaining birds in the surroundings were culled, thus ending the occurrence of the species in the 'wild' in the area. However, in the early 2000s vagrants from most probably France were recorded in northern Catalonia, and sporadic observations throughout the year have been recorded since then along the Mediterranean and Cantabrian coasts. There were a total of about twenty approved records of sightings between 1994 and 2004. As of 2009, birds entering Spain from France are shot. The population in Italy may have been introduced from the zoo Le Cornelle which has kept a free-flying group since the early 1980s, or possibly from Brittany, but this is unclear. The first pair was seen breeding in the nearby heronry at Oldenico, in Lame del Sesia Regional Park in Novara, NW Italy, in 1989. By 1998 there was a colony of 9 pairs and 48 birds there; by 2000 there were 24‚Äì26 pairs, and by 2003 there were 25‚Äì30 breeding pairs. A second colony appeared in 2004 at another nearby heronry at Casalbeltrame. These birds would mostly feed in the rice fields in the area, but would also migrate elsewhere during the summer, with the population at the roosts increasing in the winter. In 2008, the number of breeding ibis was estimated at 80‚Äì100 pairs, and at least 300 birds. That same year, six individuals, consisting of three pairs, were observed roosting at a heronry in Casaleggio. By 2009 they were said to be one of the most characteristic animals of the rice-growing area of Novara and Vercellese. In 2010 the species was reported attempting to breed in the Po Delta, northeast Italy. By 2014 reports of individuals and small flocks were recorded in various areas from the Po Valley down to Tuscany. Outside the Piedmont Region, cases of possible nesting are reported in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardy. As of 2017 there do not seem to be coordinated control efforts in Italy. In the Netherlands, sacred ibises were introduced from three sources; primarily from the free-flying flock at the aviary zoo Avifauna, and another group of 11 birds which escaped from a private bird trader in Weert when a tree fell on their enclosure sometime between 1998 and 2000 which would all return to their cage each winter. Furthermore, in 2000 a group of sacred ibises escaped from a zoo near Munster, some of which apparently crossed the border into Overijssel, as the colours of their rings closely matched. The free-flying Avifauna flock numbered 12 in 2001, 30 in 2003, and an estimated maximum of 41 birds escaped the zoo eventually. There had been sightings throughout the country for many years, but in 2002 successful breeding was first reported in a nature reserve some 40 km from Avifauna. By 2007 the feral population in the Netherlands had increased to 15 pairs breeding at three locations, including in a tree just outside the zoo. Pairs would regularly move from the zoo to the nature reserve in the summer and vice versa. The next year, in 2008, the tree outside the zoo was cut down, and free-flying birds were recaptured, clipped and caged. 2008/2009 was also a cold winter and many birds died. By 2009 37 birds had been recaptured and by 2010 there were no more birds breeding in the wild. The birds in Weert were halved in number after the 2008‚Äì2009 winter and had disappeared somewhere between 2011 and 2015. As of 2016 a few birds survive, some still attempting to breed in Overijssel, and handful sightings of less than three reported. Possible vagrants from France have also been noted (by their rings) after 2010.  Elsewhere  The sacred ibis is not considered invasive on the Canary Islands. It is kept in zoos on Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, two of which kept their collections free-flying. In 1989, the first ibis was seen in the wild. In 1997, the first pair was seen breeding outside a zoo, the population reached a maximum of 5 pairs between then and 2005, and 30 pairs is given by Clergeau & Y√©sou in 2006 (though this last number is untrustworthy). The birds are divided between the islands Lanzarote (near Arrecife in an old heron colony) and Fuerteventura (in the zoo near La Lajita but free-flying). On both islands, these birds have remained very near to the zoos. The breeding is 'controlled'. There is disagreement regarding the origin of other records, especially during the migratory period. Ibises have been seen on all four of the islands where there are zoos that keep them. Introduced sacred ibises bred in the United Arab Emirates in the wildlife reserve on Sir Bani Yas Island, where 6 were introduced in the early 1980s, and which did not leave the island. There was only one left in 1989 and it died that year. Al Ain Zoo has had a flock since 1976, which had increased to some 70 birds by 1991. There are records of ibises showing up in Dubai since the 1980s. Birds in Al Ain initially stayed at the zoo, but began to fly from the zoo to the sewage treatment plant and a shallow wet area in the former public park, now luxury villa park, Ain Al Fayda, where their numbers increased slowly up to 32 in 1997 and they had bred by 1998. They were not numerous outside these locations in 2002, but by 2001 1-5 ibises would show up regularly in Dubai in such places as the golf course, the sewage treatment plant, and the construction site of the now completed Dubai International City. Breeding has since occurred in Dubai. The Dubai birds especially may be partially vagrants arrived from the Iraqi marshes, as they often show up during the migrating season. On the other hand, a bird showing up in Iran is suspected to be from the introduced U.A.E. population. As of 2010 the population in Al Ain numbers over 75 birds, and the free-flying zoo birds roost in two subcolonies on top of their aviary. Birds regularly show up throughout the city and surrounding villages and can often be seen in the early morning in parks and roundabouts picking up scraps left by people the night before. A breeding population was listed as introduced on Bahrain since at least 2006, but it is also said to be a vagrant on the island. In Taiwan, as elsewhere, the founding population escaped from a zoo, in this case before 1984, at which time the first wild birds were seen at Guandu in Taipei. In 1998 it was estimated that some 200 birds roamed freely, primarily in northern Taiwan. In 2010 it was first added to the Checklist of Birds of Taiwan with the status of 'uncommon' (as opposed to 'rare'). By 2010 the birds were also occasionally sighted on the Matsu Islands, which are only 19 km off the coast of Fujian province in mainland China (and only a few kilometres from other coastal Chinese islands), but 190 km from Taiwan. In 2012 the population was estimated to be 500‚Äì600 individuals, and had spread to the west of Taiwan. The first attempts at culling were performed in 2012 using the egg-oiling method (unsuccessful), and by killing chicks from nests (successful). By 2016 the number was estimated at 1000 individuals, of whom around 500 inhabited a wetland in Changhua County. In Florida five individuals of the species are thought to have escaped Miami Metro Zoo, and perhaps more from private collections, after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. These birds lived in the surroundings but would return to roost at the zoo at night, and the population slowly increased to 30 or 40 by 2005. That same year two pairs were found nesting in the Everglades. Two or three years later the decision was made to remove the species. By 2009 75 birds were removed from Florida, and the birds are believed to be eradicated.  Ecology  = Habitat = The African sacred ibis occurs in marshy wetlands and mud flats, both inland and on the coast. It preferably nests on trees in or near water. It feeds wading in very shallow wetlands or slowly stomping in wet pastures with soft soil. It will also visit cultivation and rubbish dumps. = Diet = The species are predators which feed primarily by day, generally in flocks. The diet consists of mainly insects, worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other invertebrates, as well as various fish, frogs, reptiles, small mammals and carrion. It may also probe into the soil with its long beak for invertebrates such as earthworms. It even sometimes feeds on seeds. Sacred ibises were observed to occasionally feed on the contents of pelican eggs broken by Egyptian vultures in the mixed colonies of the ibises, cormorants, pelicans and Abdim's storks at Lake Shala in Ethiopia. On Central Island in Lake Turkana sacred ibises were noted to incidentally eat Nile crocodile eggs excavated by Nile monitors. Most recently, in 2006, observations were reported from a large mixed colony on Bird Island (called Penguin Island in the article) in South Africa, where 10,000 pairs of gannets nested, together with 4800 pairs of Cape cormorant and other species such as gulls and jackass penguin. Within a period of 3 years, a few specialized sacred ibis individuals out of the 400 that roosted on the island had fed on at least 152 eggs of the cormorant (other species were even more ovivorous). In a study of pellets and stomachs contents of nestlings in the Free State, South Africa, food is mostly reported to consist of frogs (mainly Amietia angolensis and Xenopus laevis), Potamonautes warreni crabs, blow fly maggots, Sphingidae caterpillars, and adult beetles. During the first 10 days of life nestlings fed mainly on crabs and beetles, and later mainly on Sphingidae caterpillars and more beetles. The breeding colony collected different (proportions of) prey the subsequent year. The food of one one‚Äêmonth old nestlings at Lake Shala, Ethiopia, consisted of beetle larvae, caterpillars and beetles. In France, adult ibises fed largely on the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii, for nestlings larvae of Eristalis species are important. In France, they sometimes supplement their diet by feeding at rubbish tips in the winter. = Predators = The most important predator of nestlings of the sacred ibis in Kenya is the African fish eagle, which preferentially searches for the largest (sub-)colonies to attack, but in Ethiopia and South Africa it poses less of a threat. = Diseases = This species was reported to be susceptible to avian botulism in a list of dead animals found around a man-made lake in South Africa which tested positive for the pathogen in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During a large scale mortality of Cape cormorants from avian cholera in 1991 in western South Africa, small numbers of sacred ibis were killed. The new species Chlamydia ibidis was isolated from feral sacred ibis in France in 2013; it infected 6-7 of the 70 birds tested. In 1887, the Italian scientist Corrado Parona reported a 3 cm Physaloptera species of nematode in the orbital cavity of a sacred ibis collected in Metemma, Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in 1882. He thought it was perhaps a new species, as it differed morphologically from earlier seen worms. A single adult female was recovered, and it has never been seen again. As the Physaloptera species infecting birds are generally parasites of the intestines of raptors; it might be an artefact, or perhaps a misidentification, or possibly a dead-end host infection. The digenean trematode Patagifer bilobus, a fluke, has been reported from sacred ibis in Sudan before 1949. It lives in the small intestine of this species, among numerous other ibises, spoonbills, and a few other waterfowl. It has a complicated life history involving three hosts: the eggs hatch in fresh water where they infect a ram's horn snail in which they multiply and produce cercariae, which exit and encyst in a larger snail such as a Lymnaea, waiting to be eaten by a bird.  Reproduction  Montagu, Western Cape, South Africa Eggs of the Threskiornis aethiopicus - MHNT The species usually breeds once per year in the wet season. Breeding season is from March to August in Africa, from April to May in Iraq. It builds a stick nest, often in a baobab tree. The bird nests in tree colonies, often with other large wading birds such as storks, herons, African spoonbills, African darters, cormorants. It may also form single-species groups on offshore islands or abandoned buildings. Large colonies consist of numerous subcolonies and can number 1000 birds. immature, Uganda Females lay 1-5 eggs per season, incubated by both parents for 21‚Äì29 days. After hatching, one parent continuously stays at the nest for the first 7-days. Chicks fledge after 35‚Äì40 days and are independent after 44‚Äì48 days, reaching sexual maturity 1‚Äì5 years after hatching.  Conservation  The African sacred ibis is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN. The global population is estimated at 200,000‚Äì450,000 individuals but appears to be decreasing. It is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA).  In myth and legend  Copenhagen Museum Brooklyn Museum For many centuries, sacred ibis, along with two other species in lesser numbers, were commonly mummified by the Ancient Egyptians as a votive offering to the god Thoth. Thoth, whose head is that of an ibis, is the Ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and reason, and thus of truth, knowledge, learning and study, and writing and mathematics. The sacred ibis was considered the living incarnation of Thoth on earth. Properly mummified birds enjoyed a path to the afterlife. Pilgrims from all over Egypt brought thousands of ibis offerings to four or more main temples, which at their peak mummified and buried thousands of birds a year in gigantic and ancient catacombs (one complex was in operation for 700 years). Eventually an estimated eight million birds were mummified and entombed by the Ancient Egyptians. It has long been thought, to sustain sufficient numbers for the large and sometimes growing demand for sacrifices by the people, dozens of ibis breeding farms (called ibiotropheia by Herodotus) were established, initially throughout the regions of Egypt, but later centralised around the main temples, each producing around a thousand birds for mummies annually. An examination of the mitochondrial DNA disputes this and suggests that not only were wild birds were caught and added to the captive flocks, but that they provided the bulk of the supply. The mummified birds were often young and were usually killed by breaking their neck. The head and bill were often placed between the tail feathers, and a piece of food was often placed in the bill (often a snail). The particulars of the mummification ritual often differed. The mummies could be stored in ceramic jars, wooden chests or stone sarcophagi. Not all mummies contain whole birds; some (cheaper ones) contain only a leg, an eggshell, or even dried grass from the nest. Birds were given different burials according to their status; as pets, offerings or holy individuals. Special sacred birds were afforded special mummification, transported from their cities to the temples long after normal offerings were sourced from temple farm flocks, and honoured with more luxurious burial. Different regions in Egypt observed slightly different practises regarding the ritual beliefs. Ibis mummification started by at least 1,100 BC and petered out by approximately 30 BC. Although the numbers of burials peaked at different times depending on the region and temple, the rituals were most popular from the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period. Mummified specimens of the sacred ibis were brought back to Europe by Napoleon's army, where they became part of an early debate about evolution. According to Herodotus and Pliny the Elder the ibis was invoked against incursions of winged serpents. Herodotus wrote: Josephus tells us that when Moses lead the Hebrews to make war upon the √Üthiopians, he brought a great number of the birds in cages of papyrus to oppose any serpents. Due to perhaps a mistranslation of the Greek of Herodotus, before the early 18th century Europeans were convinced that these ibises had human feet. Pliny the Elder tells us that it was said that the flies that brought pestilence died immediately upon propitiatory sacrifices of this bird. According to Claudius Aelianus in De Natura Animalium, and Gaius Julius Solinus, both quoting much earlier but now lost authors, the sacred ibis procreates with its bill, and thus the bird is always a virgin. Aristotle, writing some 500 years earlier, also mentions this theory, but repudiates it. Picrius mentions how the venomous basilisk is hatched from the eggs of ibis, nurtured from the poisons of all the serpents the birds devour. These authors and many others also mention how crocodiles and snakes are rendered motionless after being touched by the feather of an ibis. Claudius Aelianus also says the ibis is consecrated to the moon. Pliny and Galen ascribe the invention of the clyster (enema) to the ibis, as according to them it gave such treatments to hippopotami. Plutarch assures us it uses only salt water for this purpose. 1600 years later this was still accepted science, as Claude Perrault, in his anatomical descriptions of the bird, claimed to have found a hole in the bill which the bird used for that purpose. In the century before the time of Christ and for at least a century after, the worship of Isis had become quite popular in Rome, especially among women, and the ibis had become one of her associated symbols. A number of frescoes and mosaics in the patrician villas of Pompeii and Herculaneum of 50BC-79AD show these birds. According to some translations of the septuagint, the ibis is one of the unclean birds which may not be eaten (Leviticus 11:17, Deuteronomy 14:16).

Virginia Dale is situated in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains on U.S. Highway 287, approximately 45 mi (72 km) northwest of Ft. Collins and approximately 4 mi (6 km) south of the Wyoming border. In the late 19th century, Virginia Dale was a famous stop on the Overland Trail. The stage station, the last of its kind still standing, and its associated home, the Hurzeler House, are owned and maintained by the Virginia Dale Community Club.Virginia Dale Community Club. Overland Trail stage station The Virginia Dale stage station was established in 1862 by Jack Slade, former station manager at Julesburg, Colorado where he famously got into a dispute with Jules Beni. Beni had previously shot Slade five times but Slade survived and exacted his revenge by ambushing Beni, tying him to a fencepost and shooting off his fingers before delivering a coup de grace to the head. Slade kept Beni's ears as trophies. While station master in Julesburg, Slade met and breakfasted with Samuel Clemens, \\"Mark Twain\\" and made quite an impression upon Twain. Twain wrote about his encounter with Slade in his 1872 publication \\"Roughing It\\". When Ben Holladay took over the Overland Stage in 1862, he changed the route, taking it south from Julesberg along the South Platte River to Greeley and then up the old Cherokee Trail through Latham, LaPorte, Virginia Dale, Colorado, and into Wyoming. Virginia Dale was a \\"home station\\" on the Overland Trail, meaning that passengers could disembark, get a meal, and stay overnight in a hotel if the stage was delayed by weather or nightfall. Thirty to fifty horses were kept at the station which was located in a pleasant, grassy glade (or \\"dale\\") along a clear bubbling stream, later named Dale Creek. Slade probably named the post after his wife Virginia, whose maiden name might have been \\"Dale\\". Slade was an excellent stage manager as long as he stayed sober. Many stories credit him with outrageous actions from shooting up a saloon in LaPorte for serving his stage drivers whiskey, or for having \\"a fondness of shooting canned goods off grocery store shelves\\" Colorado, a guide to the highest State, By Writers' Program of the Work Projects Administration in the State of Colorado to robbing the stage of $60,000 in gold, which later disappeared. Slade was fired as stage manager in November, 1862 after a drunken shooting spree at nearby Fort Halleck and left with his wife for Virginia City, Montana where he was hanged in early 1864 by angry miners. The Virginia Dale stage station hosted many famous travelers such as author Albert D. Richardson (\\"Beyond the Mississippi\\") and an Illinois governor, probably Richard Yates. Samuel Bowles, editor of the Massachusetts Republican wrote in 1865, > \\"Virginia Dale deserves its pretty name. A pearly, lively-looking stream > runs through a beautiful basin of perhaps one hundred acres, among the > mountains - for we are within the entrances of one of the great hills- > stretching away in smooth and rising pasture to nooks and crannies of the > wooded range; fronted by rock embankment, and flanked by the snowy peaks > themselves; warm with the June sun, and rare with an air into which no fetid > breath has poured itself-it is difficult to imagine a loveable spot in > Nature's kingdom.\\" The station itself was built with timber cut by Hiram 'Hi\\" Kelly, one of the first profitable cattle ranchers in the Laramie area. In 1865 future Vice President Schuyler Colfax (then Speaker of the US House of Representatives) was detained at the post by Native American raids. It is possible that Virginia Dale served briefly as a telegraph station. Settlement After the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867, the stage stop was abandoned. Settlers began moving into the area in 1872, establishing the first school in 1874. The first church was built in 1880. The community was formerly the site of a post office and cafe along Highway 287 until the 1990s, when the cafe and post office were shut down. The area continues to be a region of cattle ranching. The original 1874 school still stands along U.S. Highway 287 and the original stage station still stands a short distance east of the highway. The U.S. Post Office at Livermore (ZIP Code 80536) now serves Virginia Dale postal addresses.  Historical marker  Click on the image (up to twice) to enlarge it. The settlement is memorialized by a bronze plaque just off U.S. 287 on the easterly side (about a mile north of the school and a few hundred yards north of the abandoned post office).

Often described as a small van (based on the chassis of a truck or pickup truck) used mostly for delivery rounds, the British equivalent is a \\"delivery van.\\" History Chevrolet Advance Design panel truck Consumer demand from farmers and businesses for stripped-down Model T versions prompted Henry Ford to market vehicles that independent builders could supply cabs and cargo enclosures according to users' needs. The U.S. Army ordered 20,000 Dodge half-ton chassis sets for use as cargo trucks and ambulances During World War I that were then marketed after the war as the \\"Screenside Commercial Car\\" - a pickup‚Äîwith a roof and roll-up side covers or a fully enclosed cargo-bed. Chevrolet made a van-like version of their Chevrolet Suburban, which was a station wagon version of the Chevrolet pickup truck from the 1930s. Panel truck versions of the Suburban were made until 1973 when they were replaced by the Chevrolet Greenbrier van which used parts from the Chevrolet Task Force panel truck. Ford made panel truck versions of their pickup trucks until 1960. Panel trucks were also converted into canopy expresses, which were primarily used by farmers. Panel truck versions of the Agrocar were also released until 1978. The style of the panel trucks from the 1930s to 1950s inspired the style of both the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Chevrolet HHR. The last panel truck was theoretically the second-generation Chevrolet C/K Suburban panel truck. Difference The difference between a sedan delivery and a panel truck is that the sedan delivery is based on the chassis of a sedan, hatchback, or station wagon, while a panel truck is based on the chassis of a pickup truck, SUV or in some rare cases of a crossover. Unibody-based vans are similar in size and in functionality but have a unibody chassis.

With its summit at , the massive Mount Lister forms the highest point in this range. Mount Lister is located along the western shore of McMurdo Sound between the Koettlitz, Skelton and Ferrar glaciers. Other notable local terrain features include Allison Glacier, which descends from the west slopes of the Royal Society Range into Skelton Glacier. Discovery and naming The range was probably first seen by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841. The range was explored by the British National Antarctic Expedition (BrNAE) under Robert Falcon Scott, who named the range after the Royal Society and applied names of its members to many of its peaks. For example, Mount Lister was named for Lord Joseph Lister, President of the Royal Society, 1895-1900. The Royal Society provided financial support to the expedition and its members had assisted on the committee which organized the expedition. Geology The Royal Society Range consists of a Precambrian igneous and meta-igneous basement complex overlain by Devonian- to Triassic-age sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates of the Beacon Supergroup which dip shallowly westward away from the Ross Sea coast.Sugden, D.E., Summerfield, M.A., Denton, G.H., Wilch, T.I., McIntosh, W.C., Marchant, D.R., and Rutford, R.H., 1999, Landscape development in the Royal Society Range, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica: stability since the mid-Miocene: Geomorphology, v. 28, p. 181-200. The entire region is cut by north-south trending longitudinal faults, east-west trending transverse faults, and structurally related dike swarms.Wilson, T.J., 1995, Cenozoic transtension along the Transantarctic Mountains‚ÄìWest Antarctic rift boundary, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica: Tectonics, v. 14, 531‚Äì545. Tectonic and fluvial activity have featured very heavily in the recent geologic history of the Royal Society Range. Following the extension of the Ross Sea Basin (c. 55 million years ago), an episode of uplift drove the creation of the Royal Society Range rift flank. At this time a tectonic (though not accretionary) wedge, up to 6 km thick on the coast, was present, though it quickly began to erode due primarily to fluvial processes, and the Royal Society Range was cut down near to its present appearance by the mid-Miocene. Relatively limited glacial action since that time has preserved much of the fluvial architecture of the Range, and though uplift did not cease, its magnitude is such that it has not drastically affected the landscape, having progressed only 67 meters in the last 8 million years. =Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province= Neoproterozoic tectonic extension along the edge of the East Antarctic Craton between the Skelton and Koettlitz Glaciers resulted in the emplacement of coarse grained alkaline igneous intrusive rocks (ranging from gabbro to A-type granite). This area of alkaline intrusives is referred to as the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline ProvinceRead, S. E. (2010). Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province : Late Neoproterozoic extensional magmatism in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica (Thesis, Doctor of Philosophy). http://hdl.handle.net/10523/5428 Ross Orogeny Cambrian tectonic convergence, continental collision and plate subduction led to the emplacement of calc- alkaline and adakitic granitoids. This period of mountain building is referred to as the Ross Orogeny. =Volcanic history= The Royal Society Range contains over 50 basaltic vents, ranging in size from tiny mounds to cinder cones up to 300 meters (985 feet) high. Dating of surface material indicates they were active earlier than 15 million years ago (e.g. Heald Island)Wilch, T.I., 1991, The surficial geology and geochronology of middle Taylor Valley Antarctica: Implications for Plio-Pleistocene Antarctic glacial history [M.S. thesis]: Orono, The University of Maine, 363 p., and as recently as 80,000 years ago, with glacier-bound tephra layers suggesting even more recent Holocene activity.Armstrong, R.L., 1978, K-Ar dating: Late Cenozoic McMurdo Volcanic Group and Dry Valley glacial history, Victoria Land, Antarctica: New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, v. 21, p. 685-698. The vast majority of vents are located in the foothills of the Royal Society mountains just north of Koettlitz Glacier, and most are Quaternary in age. Most emanating flows are 3‚Äì10 meters thick and less than 4 kilometers long. The composition, with very few exceptions, is porphyritic basanite with primarily olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, though some phenocrystic plagioclase is also present.Wright, A.C., and Kyle, P.R., 1990, Royal Society Range Summary, in LeMasurier, W.E., and Thomson, J.W., eds., Volcanoes of the Antarctic Plate and Southern Oceans: Washington, DC, American Geophysical Union, Antarctic Research Series, v. 48, p. 81-88.

Shaw and the U Street Corridor historically have been the city's black social, cultural, and economic hub, witness to Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and numerous riots, marches, and protests that fought to achieve racial equality in Shaw and the entirety of America. The District of Columbia has designated much of Shaw as the Shaw Historic District, and Shaw also contains the smaller Blagden Alley-Naylor Court Historic District, listed on the National Register. Name Map of the Shaw School Urban Renewal Area from which the concept of a Shaw neighborhood was derived. Includes the U Street and Logan Circle areas Until the 1960s, what is now Shaw was called Midcity. In 1966, planners used the enrollment boundary of Shaw Junior High School to define the Shaw School Urban Renewal Area covering what are now the Shaw, U Street Corridor and Logan Circle neighborhoods. The school had been named after Robert Gould Shaw, who led the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first official African American units during the American Civil War. As the area diversified starting in the 1990s, neighborhoods in the north, west and east of what was considered Shaw during the urban renewal era became more frequently referred to by specific names, such as the U Street Corridor (a.k.a. Cardozo/Shaw), Logan Circle, Truxton Circle, and Randolph Square; for the remaining area (7th/9th street corridor north from Convention Center to U Street), \\"Shaw\\" remains the unique, unequivocal name. Geography The most generally used definition of Shaw, without Logan Circle and the U Street Corridor, is bounded by:https://planning.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/op/publication/attachments/shaw_nif_final_plan.pdf * Florida Avenue NW and the U Street Corridor, Ledroit Park and Howard University on the north, * M Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, and Mount Vernon Square and Downtown Washington, D.C. on the south, * First St. NW and Truxton Circle on the east, and * 9th Street NW and the U Street and Logan Circle neighborhoods to the west. Shaw consists of gridded streets lined mainly with small Victorian row houses, but also north of the convention center by urban-renewal-era low-rise apartment complexes and the late 2010s mixed-use development City Market at O.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2017/05/24/new-luxury- apartments-rise-at-city-market-at-o-in-d-c-s-shaw The original commercial hub of the area prior to the redevelopment in the wake of the 1968 riots and Green Line Metrorail construction was along 7th and 9th streets NW, and especially 7th street is still lined by small businesses housed in rowhouse-sized buildings‚Äîthough with trendy shops and restaurants rather than neighborhood- oriented businesses. Tucked away into the alleys here are former light industrial buildings that now constitute the Blagden Alley-Naylor Court Historic District, home to restaurants, caf√©s and other small businesses. The Shaw Main Streets association is centered along 7th and 9th Streets between K and W streets. History Shaw emerged from freed slave encampments in the rural outskirts of Washington, D.C. It was originally called \\"Uptown\\", in an era when the city's boundary ended at \\"Boundary Street\\" (now Florida Avenue). The neighborhood thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the pre- Harlem, national center of U.S. black intellectual and cultural life. During this time, President Andrew Johnson signed Howard University's founding charter. Furthermore, in 1925, Professor Alain LeRoy Locke advanced the idea of \\"The New Negro\\" while Langston Hughes descended from LeDroit Park to hear the \\"sad songs\\" of 7th Street. Another famous Shaw native to emerge from this period‚Äîsometimes called the Harlem Renaissance‚Äîwas Duke Ellington. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots erupted in many D.C. neighborhoods, including Shaw, Columbia Heights, and the H Street, NE corridor. The 1968 Washington, D.C. riots marked the beginning of a decline in population and development that condemned much of the inner city to a generation of economic decay. After the riots, Shaw was left without electricity and with burnt down buildings. Crime and fear increased. Succeeding the riots, Shaw civic leaders Walter Fauntroy and Watha T. Daniel led grassroots community renewal projects with the Model Inner City Community Organization (MICCO). MICCO used federal grant money to employ African American architects, engineers, and urban planners in inner-city Washington, D.C. Shaw is a residential neighborhood dominated by 19th-century Victorian row houses. The architecture of these houses, Shaw's central location, and the stability of D.C.'s housing market have transformed the neighborhood through gentrification. Gentrification beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s generated new discussions between the inhabitants of the Shaw neighborhood and the Dupont Circle Conservancy organization. Preservation advocates in the Dupont Circle neighborhood began to propose the expansion of the neighborhood. The advocates were members of the Dupont Circle Conservancy, an organization predominantly led by European-American people. As a response to this proposal, the 14th and U Street Coalition, which called itself the representative of black interests and historical identity in neighboring Shaw, began protesting that the Dupont Circle preservationists were trying to occupy their neighborhood and its history. Discussions as such still have present day implications. Gentrification in the 2010s is transforming the neighborhood into an upscale retail hub. But the mix of upscale newcomers and very poor, long-time residents have been linked to social implications that vary from cultural to political within the community. In Shaw, wealthy newcomers and lower class, long-term residents have shown differences in tastes, preferences, and values. Gentrification has also brought about a greater spectrum of political views in Shaw. Because the population has become more diversified, an influx of differing views, ideas, and outlooks has become more prominent.Hyra, Derek. \\"The Back-to-the-City Movement: Neighbourhood Redevelopment and Processes of Political and Cultural Displacement.\\" Urban Studies 52 (August 2015): 1753‚Äì1775. Infrastructure and landmarks =Public transportation= Dunbar Theatre, also known as the Southern Aid Society Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shaw neighborhood is served by the Green and Yellow lines of the Washington Metro with stops at Shaw-Howard University Station, U Street Station and Mount Vernon Square Station. There is a bus service within Shaw, which has several routes that connects the area with the Waterfront and Silver Spring via 7th Street. Also, the G2 bus connects Georgetown University and Howard University. Freeway access allows cars to maneuver through the streets of Shaw. Transit Score Methodology, which is a patented measure of how well a location is served by public transit on a scale from 0 to 100, measures the Shaw neighborhood with a score of 80. A score of 80 concludes that Shaw has \\"excellent transit\\", meaning transit is convenient for most trips. The White House, via public transit, is on average 10 minutes away from Shaw. Reagan National Airport, via public transit, is on average 28 minutes away from Shaw. Dulles International Airport, via cab, is on average 40 minutes away from Shaw. =Cultural institutions= Shaw's neighborhood offers different cultural landmarks consisting of: * Howard Theatre, owned by Abe Lichtman, a white owner of theaters that catered to African Americans, it was billed the \\"largest color theater in the World\\" in the 1970s. After restoration, it still hosts artists and performers in today's entertainment industry. * Dunbar Theater, currently known as the Southern Aid Society, holds nearly 350 seats and was a popular venue for live entertainment, including many jazz and blues artists as well as movies. Originally opening in the 1920s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968, shortly after closing in 1960. * CityMarket at O (named \\" O Street Market\\" until 2008) is a Gothic Revival historic landmark, being one of the three public market buildings from the 19th century in DC; it won several awards for its design. * The Shiloh Baptist Church, originally located in Fredericksburg (VA), plays an active part in helping, spiritually and economically, the Shaw's community. President Barack Obama and his family attended its Easter Sunday mass in 2011. * The Watha T. Daniel/Shaw Neighborhood Library is a three-level library of which design was renovated in 2010 and received several awards for its excellence; it was also named as one of the top buildings of 2010 by The Wall Street Journal. * The Walter E. Washington Convention Center, whose north portion is located in Shaw, has 703,000 square feet of exhibition space. It has hosted several official events including some hosted by President Barack Obama. It is also famous for its eco-friendly features. From 2017 to 2024, the WEWCC will be hosting Otakon.http://www.dcconvention.com/Venues/ConventionCenter.aspx =Parks and recreation= * Shaw Park, Shaw Dog Park, Cardozo Recreation Center *Kennedy Recreation Center including a baseball field *Bundy Field, Bundy Dog Park Demographics Shaw has grown dramatically since the mid-to- late 20th century, with a 2010 population of 17,639. In 1950, the area's population had reached over 34,000 people, around double its current level. Like many neighborhoods throughout Washington, D.C., Shaw hit a population low point in the 1980s and 1990s, rebounding considerably at the turn of the 21st century. The lack of investment and limited power in the area created a barrier in the neighborhood's development and urbanization during the early 1800s. Further growth was hindered by increasing racial tensions as more African-Americans settled in the region; by the 1850s, Washington, D.C. had the largest African-American population of any city in the United States. The increasing costs of housing also decreased the availability of affordable housing, generating further racial tensions citywide and neighborhood segregation. One such neighborhood was Shaw, which continues to be populated by many African-Americans, but also Shaw is now experiencing an increase in prices. Newly constructed luxury apartment buildings include The Shay and Jefferson Marketplace. The current forecast for the price of housing expects a steady increase of about 2.5% over the few years, which could lead to further displacement among the black community and a phenomenon known as root shock. According to the latest census of the Logan Circle/Shaw area, majority (71%) of residents is single, college-educated (67%) and has a median income of $84,875. The majority of residents in Shaw are between the ages of 22 and 39; they constitute 44.5% of the population. This is greater than the average District of Columbia percentage of 34.5% for this age group. Children between the ages of 0 to 17 make up 15.4% of the population. The percentages of genders within each age group is generally equal except for 85+ which has 94.4% female to only 5.6% male and 20-year-olds which is 84.9% female to 15.1% male. =Little Ethiopia= Since the 1980s, Ethiopian-born business owners have been purchasing property in the neighbourhood of Shaw, specifically Thirteenth and Ninth Streets. The area has since gained distinctive popularity in Washington even outside of the Ethiopian community. According to restaurant owner Tefera Zwedie: \\"I remember it was if I'm not mistaken somewhere between 2000, 2001 it was something big for us to see one non-Ethiopian coming to the restaurant. Now 95 percent of them are non-Ethiopian.\\" The food has become a main attraction and reason for locals and tourists to commute to Shaw and experience the many local Ethiopian restaurants.This influx of Ethiopians has revitalized the area, prompting members of the Ethiopian American community to lobby the city government to officially designate the block as \\"Little Ethiopia\\". Although no legislation was proposed, Shaw residents have expressed opposition to the idea, concerned that such a designation would isolate that area from the historically African-American Shaw.Showalter, Mistry. \\"Inside Washington D.C.'s 'Little Ethiopia'\\" CNN.

Department of Census & Statistics, Sri Lanka. The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast PƒÅli Canon. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning. There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.Perera, HR, Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History, 2007, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/perera/wheel100.html  History  =Introduction of Buddhism= According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist council by Arhanth√† Mahinda thero, son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura. After the arrival of Arahantha Mahinda, he invited his sister Sangamitta Thera to bring a sapling of the Bodhi Tree (where Buddha was enlightened) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery, monuments and monk were introduced. Among these, the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiriya remain important centres of worship. He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya, the Jambukola vihƒÅra and the HatthƒÅlhaka vihƒÅra and the refectory. The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra. She gave the nun ordinance to women devotees. Mahavamsa ¬ß29 records that during the rule of the Greco-Bactrian King Menander I, a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alasandra\\" (Alexandria in the Caucasus, around north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, indicating that Greco-Buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism. See also the Milinda Panha. =Center of Pali literature= As a result of the work of Buddhaghosa and other compilers such as Dhammapala, Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of the written textual transmission of the Pali Canon. The compilation of the Atthakatha (commentaries) along with the NikƒÅyas and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the Aluvihare Rock Temple during the first century BCE. Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks travelled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works. =TheravƒÅda subdivisions= Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of TheravƒÅda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three mahaviharas: Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiri vihƒÅra and Jetavanaramaya.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 280 The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vihƒÅra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition. According to A.K. Warder, the Indian Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas into which they were later absorbed. Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times. In the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the \\"Mahayana Sthaviras\\" and the MahƒÅvihƒÅra tradition as the \\"Hinayana Sthaviras.\\"Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 53 Abhayagiri appears to have been a centre for Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings;\\"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship\\" by Hiram Woodward. Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun. 2004), p. 341 Xuanzang writes, \\"The MahƒÅvihƒÅravƒÅsins reject the MahƒÅyƒÅna and practice the Hƒ´nayƒÅna, while the AbhayagirivihƒÅravƒÅsins study both Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings and propagate the Tripi·π≠aka.Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. A History of Indian Buddhism: From ≈öƒÅkyamuni to Early MahƒÅyƒÅna. 2007. p. 121 In the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practised in Sri Lanka and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time.Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. A History of Indian Buddhism: From ≈öƒÅkyamuni to Early MahƒÅyƒÅna. 2007. pp. 125‚Äì126 In Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya. According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included: =Accounts of Chinese pilgrims= In the 5th century, Faxian visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks. Faxian obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka at the Abhayagiri vihƒÅra c. 406. The Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and Zhu Daosheng.Hsing Yun. Humanistic Buddhism. 2005. p. 163 This translation of the Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka Vinaya remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 1421. The 7th-century pilgrim Xuanzang first learned for several years at Nalanda and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction. However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the Chola capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit: =Decline and revival= From the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and Pandyan dynasties. This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation difficult for Buddhism. In 1070, Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts. The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks. The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under Parakramabahu I (c. 1153), who restored many stupas and monasteries. During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers MahƒÅkassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara, Moggallana Thera and SƒÅriputta Thera compiled Pali commentaries and sub-commentaries. Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya (from c. 1236) was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts. =Abolition of other Theravada traditions= Before the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris and travellers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.Hirakawa, Akira.

Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools. 2006. p. 59 The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I (1153‚Äì1186), who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions.Hirakawa, Akira.

Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras and using Buddhist prayer beads for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism. =Lineage continuity= Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE. During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and Thailand. =Colonialism and Christianity= Dutch painting of the Buddhist religious festival in Ceylon, c. 1672 From the 16th century onwards, missionaries and Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to Christianity. The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha. In 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left. From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant. During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy (1706‚Äì1739) and Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy (1739‚Äì1747) continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries. In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.Weliwita Sri Saranankara Theroenerable Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera, Dr Daya Hewapathirane, Lankaweb In 1813 the American Ceylon Mission (Protestant) was established in Jaffna. In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948. Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-Christian marriages. They also always preferred Christians in government administration. The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity =Buddhist revival= Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883). In the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the Panadura debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists.Buddhists must safeguard religion, Sangha ‚Äì Thera , Daily News In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island). The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, Sarasavisandarasa, and its English counterpart, The Buddhist. As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, who travelled around the island preaching and writing. After travelling to India, he established the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara.Maha Bodhi Society His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians. The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir D. B. Jayatilaka, F. R. Senanayake, Walisinghe Harischandra and W. A. de Silva. Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt. Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence. Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island. The Temple of the Tooth was renovated during the Buddhist revival. The Buddhist revival also resulted in Sinhala Buddhists carrying the torch of Buddhism and igniting it on foreign shores. Anagarika Dharmapala and Asoka Weeraratna are two such leading pioneers among many others. They pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the Berlin Buddhist Vihara in Dr. Paul Dahlke‚Äôs Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957 with monks from Sri Lanka stationed on a long-term footing to spread the Dhamma. This was the first Theravada Buddhist Vihara in Germany and continental Europe. Since the Buddhist revival, Sri Lanka has also been an important centre of Western Buddhist scholarship. One of the first western bhikkhus, Nyanatiloka Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven. Nyanaponika (who established the Buddhist Publication Society along with Bhikkhu Bodhi) were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism in English and German. =Bhikkhuni ordination= A few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century. Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.Buddhist Studies Review, vol. 24.2, p. 227 In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven. Dodangoda Revata MahƒÅthera and the late Ven. Mapalagama VipulasƒÅra MahƒÅthera of the MahƒÅbodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order. Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition;id, p. 227 others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone.id, p. 228 Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka. Buddhist monastic groups The different sects of the Sri Lankan Buddhist clergy are referred to as Nikayas, and three main Nikayas are: * Siam Nikaya, founded in the 18th century by Ven. Upali Thera, a Siamese monk who was invited by the King Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy, and on the initiative of Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero. * Amarapura Nikaya, founded in 1800 with higher ordination obtained from Myanmar (Burma) * Ramanna Nikaya, founded in 1864 by Ambagahawatte Saranankara. Within these three main divisions, there are numerous other divisions, some of which are caste-based. There are no doctrinal differences among any of them. Demographics Buddhism in Sri Lanka 2012 Census Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practised by the Sinhalese, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 including eleven monks, amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka. In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist.The Library of Congress. (2009). A Country Study: Sri Lanka. Available: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lktoc.html.

They are of volcanic origin, consisting of low scattered mountains and nunataks that protrude through the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The Hudson Mountains are bounded on the north by Cosgrove Ice Shelf and on the south by Pine Island Glacier. Geology The Hudson Mountains contain slightly eroded parasitic cones that overlie three extensively eroded Miocene stratovolcanoes: Mount Manthe, Teeters Nunatak and Mount Moses. Potential steam was reported in 1974 and an unconfirmed report of an eruption detected by satellite was made in 1985, indicating that the Hudson Mountains may be volcanically active. Volcanic activity of the Hudson Mountains has produced predominately subaerial basaltic lava flows, although subglacial or subaqueous tuffs and lava flows have also been noted. A tephra layer deposited from a subglacial eruption has been dated at about 200 BCE based on ice thickness. History The mountains were discovered by members of the USAS in flights from the in February 1940, and further delineated from air photos taken by USN Operation Highjump in December 1946. The full extent of the group was mapped by USGS from US Navy air photos of 1966. Named by US-SCAN after Captain William L. Hudson, commander of during USEE, 1838‚Äì1842. Peacock, accompanied by under Lieutenant Walker, cruised along the edge of the pack to the north of this area for several days during the latter part of March 1839. On January, 2008, the British Antarctic Survey scientists led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 years ago, a volcano had a subglacial eruption under the Antarctic ice sheet, based on airborne survey with radar images. Described as the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.

The city of Figueres, an important urban and economic center of the Empord√†, was designated the capital of Alt Empord√†, while La Bisbal d'Empord√†, following a more geographic and historical criteria, became the capital of Baix Empord√†. Empord√† has been the cradle for many pictoric schools, with surrealism standing out, including artists such as Salvador Dal√≠, Angel Planells, Joan Massanet and Evarist Vall√®s. Etymology The name Empord√† is a derivative of Emp√∫ries (Emp√≤rion in Old Greek or Emporiae in Latin), which means \\"the markets\\". The name Empord√† comes from a succession of phonetic derivatives of County of Emp√∫ries, a county which had its capital first in Sant Mart√≠ d'Emp√∫ries and then in Castell√≥ d'Emp√∫ries the capital of medieval Empord√† during the period of political splendor of this county. This was one of the most insurgent towards the royal power and one of the lasts to join the Crown of Aragon, and that led to a few curious episodes like the deviation of the Ter (river) or the unfinished build of the Montgr√≠ Castle on top of the Montgr√≠ Massif. The Baix Empord√† born writer Josep Pla used to refer to the surroundings of his native Palafrugell as Empordanet, or the region that goes in between the Gavarres and the Montgr√≠, and that name is still used today to refer to the Baix Empord√†.L'Empord√† de Josep Pla by the Josep Pla Foundation  History  The region was already inhabited in the prehistory. There are a number of caves that served as a shelter for paleolithic men in the Montgr√≠ Massif; the most famous ones share the same name: \\"Cau Del Duc\\", one in Torroella and the other in Ull√†. We also find important megalithic structures in Mass√≠s de les Gavarres or Mass√≠s de Cadiretes, as well as the dolmens in Fitor. The Greeks established themselves very close to the actual region, in Rhodes in the 8th century BC and in Emp√∫ries at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The Iberians built one of their main cities in Ullastret in the 6th century BC; the name of the tribe was Indigetes. But with the arrival of the Romans, a process of transformation was initiated that changed the occupational system and the economic exploitation of the territory, which led to the abandonment of Ullastret in the 2nd century BC. The Baix Empord√† was Romanized like all other places of the Roman Empire but that was followed by barbaric invasions in the 3rd and 5th centuries that notably impoverished the region and reduced their urban centers to the minimum expression. There are many traces of the Romanization, but it is hard to envision the print of the Visigoths and the Arabs, because the proximity of the Kingdom of the Franks caused the creation of independent counties ruled by feudal lords. The Muslim invasion actually lasted less than sixty years (714‚Äì785) and the old Hispano-Gothic population came back. The administrative division of the Carolingian Empire divided the conquered Catalan territory in counties. While the north of the county and the current Alt Empord√† was organised around the county of Emp√∫ries, the rest were regions or sub-regions of the Bishop of Girona, owner of extensive lands‚Äîespecially in the Baix Empord√†-, or baronies from branches of the Cardona vinculated to the county, to then be the maritime center of the county of Girona, from Begur to Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols.

The Auto Train‚ÄîWhere Relative Strangers Become Relatives. Passengers ride either in coach seats or private sleeping car rooms while their vehicles are carried in enclosed automobile-carrying freight cars, called autoracks. The train has a maximum capacity of 320 vehicles. The train also includes lounge cars and dining cars. The Auto Train service allows its passengers to avoid driving Interstate 95 in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, while bringing their own vehicle with them. The service operates as train 53 southbound and 52 northbound. The train is non-stop between its terminal at Lorton, Virginia, and Sanford, Florida. Amtrak's Auto Train is the successor to an earlier similarly named service operated by the privately owned Auto-Train Corporation in the 1970s.

History  The Auto-Train at Lorton, Virginia, in 1973. = Auto-Train Corporation = The original Auto-Train operated on Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac tracks. It was operated by Auto-Train Corporation, a privately owned railroad founded by Eugene K. Garfield. Garfield had worked at the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Department had funded a study of the practicality of an automobile-train service. Garfield resigned and used the study as the blueprint for his enterprise. The company used its own rolling stock to provide a unique rail transportation service for both passengers and their automobiles in the United States, operating scheduled service between Lorton, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and Sanford, Florida, near Orlando, Florida.. Passengers rode either in wide coach seats or private first-class sleeping compartments while their vehicles were carried in enclosed autoracks. The train included dining cars and meals were served. The equipment of the Auto-Train Corporation was painted in red, white, and purple colors. The typical train was equipped with two or three General Electric U36B diesel-electric locomotives, double-deck auto carriers, streamlined passenger cars, including coaches, dining cars, sleeping cars, and full-dome cars, and a caboose, then an unusual sight on most passenger trains. Auto-Train's first auto carriers were acquired used, and started life in the 1950s as an innovation of the Canadian National (CN) Railroad. The CN bi-level autorack cars had end-doors. They were huge by the standards of the time; each 75-footer (23.86 m) could carry eight vehicles. Auto-Train Corporation's new service began operations on December 6, 1971. The Auto-Train was immediately popular with the traveling public and at first enjoyed financial success as well. In FY 1974 the company turned a profit of $1.6 million on revenues of $20 million. In May 1974 service began over a second route between Florida and Louisville, Kentucky, and the company was mulling additional service between Chicago and Denver. The Louisville extension proved to be the company's undoing. The decaying Louisville and Nashville Railroad track between Louisville and Florida (which also hampered Amtrak's Floridian) hindered operations, and a pair of derailments stretched the company's finances to the breaking point. Service ceased in April 1981. =Amtrak= Superliners are lined up at the left, with autoracks visible to the right. Autoracks lined up at their loading ramps at the Lorton station. The ramps are not visible from this angle. Autoracks lined up at their loading ramps at the Lorton station. After a period of 22 months without service, the service was revived by Amtrak, which operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States. Amtrak acquired the terminals in Lorton and Sanford and some of the Auto-Train equipment. On October 30, 1983, it introduced its new version of the service (under the slightly modified name \\"Auto Train\\") on a triweekly basis. Daily service was introduced a year later. Amtrak continued to use the bi-level and the tri-level autoracks that Auto-Train had used. For passenger equipment, it initially used a mixture of former Auto-Train railcars and mid-century long-distance railcars from Amtrak's general fleet, all rebuilt to Amtrak's \\"Heritage Fleet\\" standards. In the mid-1990s, Amtrak replaced all these passenger railcars, which were of the conventional single- level type, with its newer, bi-level Superliner I and II equipment. In 2006, the aging bi-level, tri-level, and \\"van\\" autoracks were phased out and replaced with 80 new autoracks. Unlike the old racks, the new racks have uniform heights, and are most similar to the \\"vans\\" of the previous fleet. , an Auto Train consist is normally made up of two General Electric P40 locomotives (and sometimes a third engine) and up to 50 railcars (passenger and autorack), for a total length of or more. A typical train has one transition sleeper (for the crew), six sleepers (including two with all Deluxe Bedrooms on the upper level), one diner and one lounge for sleeper passengers, four coach cars and a cafe for coach passengers, and 20‚Äì30 autoracks. The Auto Train is often said to have the longest passenger train in the world, although (as mentioned previously) it may be best regarded as a mixed train, rather than as a pure passenger train. There are two Auto Train consists in simultaneous operation each day. At 4:00 pm, the trains depart from their terminals in Lorton and Sanford. They make one scheduled stop each for servicing only (passengers cannot board or disembark) at the approximate midpoint of the route in Florence, South Carolina, where the engines are refueled and a new operating crew boards (engineer and conductor). Southbound #53 arrives the next day in Sanford at 8:58 am, and northbound #52 in Lorton at 8:59 am, for average speed between termini of approximately .The timetable gives about 17 hours between the two termini. Dividing that into the distance traveled, , gives an average speed of . Auto Train operates on the same route it and its predecessor have always used, with a majority of the route owned by CSX Transportation and 16 miles of track being owned by SunRail. The trains are known by their route numbers (53 southbound and 52 northbound) internally by Amtrak. When communicating on the CSX road channels, they are known by their CSX designations: P053xx and P052xx, where xx is the 2-digit date at which the train departed its origin station. For example, a southbound train that departed on the 23rd of the month would be known as CSX P05323 on the road channels. This allows for unique identification in the event that two trains on the same route are operating simultaneously. In the January 2011 issue of Trains magazine, this route was listed as one of five routes to be looked at by Amtrak in FY 2012, like others (Sunset, Eagle, Zephyr, Capitol, and Cardinal) were in FY 2010.\\"Amtrak's Improvement Wish List\\", Trains, January 2011, 20‚Äì21. The Auto Train was the last Amtrak service to permit smoking on board. Amtrak discontinued the practice on June 1, 2013. Operations The train operates every day. At 11:30 am, the station gates are opened to allow the vehicles into the vehicle staging area. Here, each vehicle is assigned a unique number, which is affixed to the driver's door magnetically. The vehicle is typically video surveyed to document any preexisting dents and other damage, in the event a damage claim is later filed. The passengers leave their vehicles here and take their carry-on bags with them into the station to await boarding. The vehicles are then staged near the autorack ramps by size and length for optimal loading order, and are then loaded onto the autoracks. In the case of motorcycles, the owner assists with tying their bikes down to a dedicated motorcycle carrier which is then loaded into the autorack. Passengers do not have access to their vehicles during the trip. In April 2013, Amtrak started offering Priority Vehicle Offloading, a time-saving option that ensures that when the train reaches Lorton or Sanford, their vehicle is one of the first 30 vehicles offloaded from the autoracks. This service incurs a $60 or $65 charge, depending on peak or off-peak travel times. By 2 pm, the last motorcycles and vehicle/trailer combinations are accepted. Passenger boarding begins at 2:30 pm. The last vehicles and passengers are accepted up until 2:30 pm, at which time the autoracks are closed and coupled together, the passenger cars are coupled together in the case of Sanford departures, and the autoracks are coupled to the rear of the consist. Passengers arriving late are given the option of rebooking for another date or accepting a e-voucher which is valid for a year. At 4 pm, the train departs the station. There are two, three, or even four dinner seatings, depending on the number of passengers. Dinner seating is limited at each seating time and dinner tickets are distributed from the ticket office on a first come, first served basis. Each seating is announced over the intercoms in each car, and in each sleeping compartment. Meals are included in the ticket price through January 14, 2020, after which time they are included for sleeper passengers and coach passengers have an option of purchasing food from a cafe car. At approximately midnight, the train briefly stops in Florence, South Carolina, for refueling and rewatering. A new train and engine crew takes over at Florence. At 8:59 am, southbound 53 arrives in Sanford, and at 8:58 am, northbound 52 arrives in Lorton. Passengers cannot immediately detrain at this point, as the autoracks are first decoupled from the consist, and in the case of the Sanford station, the passenger cars are split into two sections to fit on Sanford's shorter platforms. At this point the passengers are then allowed to detrain and move to the auto claim area. Cleaning crews move into the train after passengers disembark, and the train is re-supplied with food and water. The passenger cars' seat backs are flipped to allow everyone in coach to ride facing forward. The autoracks are further split into three to six sections and each section is aligned with a loading ramp (see picture). The doors between each are opened, and connecting ramps are lowered to allow vehicles to move between cars. At this point vehicles begin to roll off the autoracks and to the claim area, where they are identified and announced by the vehicle number that was attached to the vehicle at the origin station. Vehicles are not unloaded in the same order they were loaded. It normally takes one hour to unload all vehicles from a full train. =Lorton Terminal= Lorton, Virginia, is about a half-hour drive south of Washington, D.C., near Interstate 95 in Northern Virginia. Amtrak's new Lorton terminal opened in early 2000 as a replacement for the original station built during the 1970s, and features a large, modern waiting area with high glass walls. The station was designed by architect Hanny Hassan. The suspended sculpture in the lobby was designed by Patrick Sheridan.Patrick Sheridan The platform is long. Lorton was selected as site of the northern terminal because the height autoracks were too tall to pass through the First Street Tunnel into Washington, D.C. =Sanford Terminal= Sanford, Florida, is the southern terminus and is about a half-hour drive north of Orlando. The original facility was older and smaller than the terminal at Lorton. Currently, the Auto Train loads its passengers on two tracks in Sanford, as no one track is long enough to accommodate all the passenger railcars. Sanford's operation is unique in that a railroad crossing runs through the middle of the rail yard. This complicates some switching procedures and also produces the need for a three-man yard conductor crew ‚Äì conductor, assistant conductor, and a utility conductor ‚Äì as opposed to Lorton's two-man operation, with only a conductor and assistant conductor. Both yards operate with one engineer. Sanford serves as the main mechanical and maintenance location for Auto Train, with diesel and car shops to service the fleet. The city of Sanford provides a shuttle bus to the historic district departing every 20 minutes between noon and 2:00 pm free of charge on all days except Sundays and certain major holidays.

Types Crimes of this sort are typically prosecuted as larceny, and may be either a misdemeanor or a felony, based upon the value of the services illegally obtained. This category encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity including tampering with (or bypassing) a utility meter so that the true level of consumption is understated, leaving a hotel or restaurant or similar establishment without paying for the service and \\"turnstile jumping\\" or other methods of evading the payment of a fare or fee when using a public transit vehicle or entering a private facility normally requiring payment (e.g., jumping over the fence at a fair or country concert). Theft of services also occurs in the taxi industry, when a passenger in a taxi flees from the taxi to avoid paying the fee. Theft of this sort should not be confused with reasonable rejection, where, for example, a customer does not pay because the services provided were not as advertised or because the services did not meet reasonable standards of quality. For example, if a roofer installs a new roof, but the roof leaks, the customer might be able to withhold payment until the leak has been fixed. Withholding of payment without reason would be considered larceny. These statutes have also, on occasion, been applied in the realm of health care, when hospitals or other health care providers have pressed criminal charges against indigent, uninsured patients who were unable to pay for their treatment. This scenario has prompted intense criticism, and is a key issue in the call for a major overhaul of the health care system in the United States.

Early life  Kayano was born in Nibutani village in Biratori, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. His family name at birth was Kaizawa, but he was adopted out by name to his aunt's family. He was raised in poverty by his alcoholic father and devout Buddhist mother, and gained his first appreciation of Ainu culture from his grandmother, Tekatte, who would share traditional stories in Ainu with him.  Cultural leader  Though he did not reach a high level of formal education, he undertook an impassioned study of Ainu folklore, art, language and history. His activism helped bring about the founding of the Nibutani Ainu Culture Museum in 1972. He was an acknowledged living master of the Ainu oral tradition, an expert in its folk arts and language. He led the effort to found 15 Ainu language schools.  Political leader  He was the first Ainu politician to sit in the Diet of Japan. He served five terms in the assembly before taking over a vacated seat in the upper house for the SDP. There he served from 1994 to 1998. In the Diet, he often posed questions in the Ainu language. His effort led to the enactment of a law to promote Ainu culture in 1997. Shigeru Kayano was also known for leading the protest movement against the Nibutani Dam. The dam over the Saru River, completed in 1997 despite legal attempts to stop it, flooded land sacred to the Ainu. Though unsuccessful, the legal effort did result in a ruling by the Sapporo District Court, acknowledging the Ainu as the indigenous people of Hokkaid≈ç for the first time. He also succeeded in his quest for abolition of The Protective Act for the Ainus in Hokkaido () and enacting the Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture & Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu TraditionsAct for the Promotion of Ainu Culture & Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions in 1997. He died of pneumonia at a hospital in Sapporo, Hokkaid≈ç on May 6, 2006, just over a month short of his 80th birthday.

He studied at the University of Oxford and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and went on to found Technologic Partners before becoming a venture capitalist in the 1980s. Moritz was named as the No. 1 venture capitalist on the Forbes Midas List in 2006 and 2007. Early life  Michael Jonathan Moritz was born to a Jewish familyTimes of Israel: \\"Jewish billionaire Michael Moritz gives $115 million to Oxford - Funding a scholarship program in honor of his father who escaped Nazi Germany and studied at Oxford with similar financial assistance\\", Times of Israel, 16 July 2012. in Cardiff, Wales on 12 September 1954. His father, Ludwig Alfred Moritz (1921-2003), was a German Jew who fled Nazi Germany. His mother, Doris (n√©e Rath; 1924-), also fled Nazi Germany. Moritz attended Howardian High School in Cardiff.  Education  Moritz earned a bachelor's degree in history at Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1978, an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania as a Thouron scholar. Career =Journalist= Moritz first worked for many years as a journalist. In the early 1980s, when he was a reporter for Time, Steve Jobs contracted him to document the development of the Mac for a book he was writing about Apple. According to Andy Hertzfeld, in response to the fact that a history of another computer company had been published a year earlier, Jobs said, \\"Mike's going to be our historian\\". As he was close in age to many on the development team, he seemed to be a good choice. By late 1982, Moritz was Times San Francisco Bureau Chief and working on the special Time Person of the Year issue, which was initially supposed to be about Jobs. His research included a lengthy interview with Jobs' high school girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, in which she discussed the history of their child, Lisa.Cocks Jay.

The issue also contained negative commentary on Jobs from other Apple employees. The special issue was renamed Machine of the Year prior to publication, celebrated The Computer and declared that, \\"it would have been possible to single out as Man of the Year one of the engineers or entrepreneurs who masterminded this technological revolution, but no one person has clearly dominated those turbulent events. More important, such a selection would obscure the main point. TIME's Man of the Year for 1982, the greatest influence for good or evil, is not a man at all. It is a machine: the computer.\\" Jobs cut off all ties with Moritz after the issue was published and threatened to fire anyone who communicated with him. According to Hertzfeld, \\"some of us talked with Mike again surreptitiously, as he was putting the finishing touches on his book around the time of the Mac introduction\\" and the resulting text, The Little Kingdom: the Private Story of Apple Computer, \\"remains one of the best books about Apple Computer ever written\\". In 2009, 25 years after The Little Kingdom, Moritz published a revised and expanded follow-up: Return to the Little Kingdom: How Apple and Steve Jobs Changed the World.http://www.overlookpress.com/return-to-the-little-kingdom.html In the prologue to Return to the Little Kingdom, Moritz states that he was as incensed as Jobs was about the Time Magazine special issue: > Steve rightly took umbrage over his portrayal and what he saw as a grotesque > betrayal of confidences, while I was equally distraught by the way in which > material I had arduously gathered for a book about Apple was siphoned, > filtered, and poisoned with a gossipy benzene by an editor in New York whose > regular task was to chronicle the wayward world of rock-and-roll music. > Steve made no secret of his anger and left a torrent of messages on the > answering machine I kept in my converted earthquake cottage at the foot of > San Francisco‚Äôs Potrero Hill. He, understandably, banished me from Apple and > forbade anyone in his orbit to talk to me. The experience made me decide > that I would never again work anywhere I could not exert a large amount of > control over my own destiny or where I would be paid by the word. I finished > my leave [and] published my book, The Little Kingdom: The Private Story of > Apple Computer, which I felt, unlike the unfortunate magazine article, > presented a balanced portrait of the young Steve Jobs. =Venture capitalist= In 1986, he joined Sequoia Capital after co-authoring Going for Broke: The Chrysler Story with Barrett Seaman, Times Detroit bureau chief. After leaving Time, Moritz co-founded Technologic Partners, a technology newsletter and conference company.

With a mean depth of only 10 metres it is considerably smaller than nearby Lake Tarawera in terms of volume of water. It is located in the Bay of Plenty region. The city of Rotorua is sited on its southern shore, and the town of NgongotahƒÅ is at the western edge of the lake. The lake was formed from the crater of a large volcano in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Its last major eruption was about 240,000 years ago. After the eruption, the magma chamber underneath the volcano collapsed. The circular depression left behind is the Rotorua Caldera, which is the site of the lake. Several other lakes of volcanic origin are located nearby to the east, around the base of the active volcano Mount Tarawera. Lake Rotorua is fed with water from a number of rivers and streams; some such as the Utuhina flow water of a water temperature warmer than the lake due to the thermal activity in the Rotorua area. Conversely streams on the northern shore such as the Hamurana Spring and the Awahou stream flow crystal clear water that has a constant temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. Other notable tributaries include the NgongotahƒÅ stream, famous for trout fishing. Despite the large volume of water flowing through Lake Rotorua its shallow depth makes it very prone to discolouration, especially from sediment following windy weather. It is well used by fishermen, but less popular with watersports participants and swimmers. Lake Rotorua Lake Rotorua flows directly into Lake Rotoiti via the Ohau Channel at the north eastern corner of the lake; this channel is navigable by boat and is also favoured by fly fishermen. The Ohau channel joins at the Mourea delta, an area with very low water levels. This area is frequented by novice kayakers and swimmers. Nearby is the ancestral land of the Ngati Pikiao hapu of the Te Arawa tribe. From Lake Rotoiti the waters of Lake Rotorua flow to the Kaituna River into the Pacific Ocean near Maketu; the rapid descent from over 900 feet above sea level in less than 20 km has created an area used for extreme kayaking and white water rafting. Mokoia Island, close to the centre of the lake, is a rhyolite dome. It is probably New Zealand's best-known lake island, and is closely associated with one of the best-known MƒÅori legends, that of Hinemoa and Tutanekai. Is said that Hinemoa swam across the lake to her lover Tutanekai who lived on Mokoia Island. Owing to the geothermal activity around the lake (including still active geysers and hot mud pools), the lake has a high sulphur content. This gives the lake's waters an unusual yellowish-green hue.

Dieffenbach was born in Giessen. He gained a degree at the university of Giessen and then, accused by authorities in the Grand Duchy of Hesse of being subversive, he fled, first to Zurich, where he received a degree in medicine before being expelled in 1836 for politics and duelling; in 1837 he arrived in London, where he eked out a living teaching German, but gained a reputation by his contributions to medical and scientific journals and made friendships with geologists Charles Lyell and Richard Owen among others. Recommendations put him aboard the Tory bound for New Zealand, travelling in the capacity of surgeon, surveyor and naturalist. During the 1840s he was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, whose Journal of Researches Dieffenbach translated into German and published, with Darwin's notes and corrections, as Naturwissenschaftlichen Reisen (Brunswick, 1853). Darwin knew Dieffenbach's paper on the Chatham Islands, contributed to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society, and he particularly noted Dieffenbach's commentary on the differences between the species of birds there and in New Zealand. Dieffenbach also translated the Geological Manual of Henry De la Beche. Partly as a result of these efforts, in 1850 he was named adjunct professor of geology at Giessen, a post he held until his death there. The extinct Dieffenbach's rail (Gallirallus dieffenbachii) a flightless rail formerly endemic to the Chatham Islands, was named after him. (The plant genus Dieffenbachia was named after the head gardener of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, Joseph Dieffenbach (1796‚Äì1863).)  Travels in New Zealand  Ernst Dieffenbach was one of the first Europeans to visit the Rotomahana area in New Zealand. He visited Rotomahana and the Pink and White Terraces while on a mission for the New Zealand Company. Dieffenbach and his assistant Symonds travelled from New Plymouth via Mount Egmont (Taranaki) and Ruapehu and then around the shores of Lake Taupo. They then travelled north, partly following the Waikato River then east towards Kakaramea (Rainbow Mountain), reaching Rotomahana Lake late one evening. They camped overnight at the mouth of the Haumi Stream. He inspired wider interest in the Pink and White Terraces with his publications. When he had completed his short stay at Rotomahana, they continued north via Lake Tarawera and the Te Ngae Mission Station to Rotorua. Dieffenbach was employed by the New Zealand Company for this excursion, and also traveled extensively throughout the North Island, making notes on flora and fauna, which can be seen in his biography at the Alexander Turnbull Library. When Dieffenbach completed his employment by the New Zealand Company he was forced to leave the country. His studies in the North Island were completed after he left New Zealand. When he attempted to re-enter New Zealand to continue his studies in the South Island he was refused entry.

Nonetheless, he makes regular recorded video tapes to mail to her. Josh asks his friend Rubin Carver to mail his tape to Tiffany before leaving for class. In class, Josh is failing Ancient Philosophy and the professor informs him he needs a B+ on his mid-term to pass the semester, and furthermore, to re-enroll. Still worrying about Tiffany, Josh's best friend E.L. Faldt convinces him to accept his friend Beth Wagner, who has a loving attraction to Josh. Jacob, the T.A. of Philosophy, has an obsessive crush on Beth and is hostile towards Josh, aware of Beth's feelings for him. During E.L.'s party, Josh attends and E.L. holds an auction of several women, including Beth. Jacob also attends the party, and Beth, scared of Jacob, convinces Josh to outbid Jacob, which he does. They quickly escape to Josh's room, and videotape their intercourse with Josh's camcorder. The next morning, Josh arrives in the room in a very jovial mood, confessing that he slept with Beth. His friends play his tape but Josh discovers that Rubin accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany, having confused it with the other tape. Josh then receives a voicemail from Tiffany saying that she did not call him because her grandfather had died and she will be away from school until Monday. Accompanied by E.L. and Rubin, Josh asks a student named Kyle to tag along, mainly because he needs Kyle's car. Kyle is a shy loner who lives in constant fear of his overly strict father, Earl Edwards, the rightful owner of their car. The group heads out to drive the nearly to Austin and back in three days and leave their friend Barry to take care of Mitch, their pet snake. When they reach Bedford, Pennsylvania,taking a supposed \\"shortcut\\", they come upon a small collapsed bridge, and are annoyed that they will waste five hours backtracking. E.L. and Rubin convince the other two that they could jump the gap. Kyle objects but they proceed. They make it across, but the car is effectively destroyed. They continue on foot and stop at a motel. Rubin tries to buy marijuana from the eccentric, unsympathetic motel clerk and is informed that Kyle's credit card is maxed out. E.L. looks for transportation, and talks an otherwise rather savvy blind woman, Brenda, who works for a local school for the blind, into letting him take a bus away to be repaired. The crew resume their journey. Meanwhile, Kyle's father, Earl, tries to pay for a meal with the maxed out card, but is denied service. He then begins an all-out search for Kyle when he is informed by the police that Kyle's car was found wrecked and Kyle is missing, believing that Kyle is kidnapped. On their way to Austin, the group goes through a series of misadventures, such as two of them making deposits at a sperm bank to raise needed funds; Kyle losing his virginity at a fraternity party after an African-American fraternity pulls a prank on the group; and a visit with Barry's grandparents. Since Josh's books were destroyed in the car wreck, he calls his professor to ask for an extension on his midterm exam. Jacob answers the phone, impersonating the professor, and grants a fake extension. While Barry is trying to feed Mitch, Beth comes back to the room inquiring of Josh's whereabouts; Barry informs her that Josh has feelings for her. Jacob walks in and informs Beth that he tricked Josh about the mid-term extension, and that he is about to fail Philosophy. Mitch bites Barry in the hand, causing a vicious struggle which ends with Mitch landing on Jacob, biting his neck, and making him lose consciousness. The group finally gets to Austin and, once they get to Tiffany's dorm, Josh eventually intercepts the tape he sent to Tiffany, who has just arrived back at school. However, Earl shows up, furious over what happened with the car and the credit card and threatens to drag Kyle back home with him. Kyle finally summons the confidence to stand up to him and states that he is going back to school with his friends. Earl assaults him and confusion reigns in an all-out mini-riot in the dorm's lobby. Josh and Tiffany retreat and discuss their relationship, but Beth calls to warn Josh that he has been tricked by Jacob, and while Josh talks to her, Tiffany starts to watch the tape, which turns out to be nothing but Barry mooning for the camera. Josh now has 48 hours to get back to school or else he will fail his midterm and the course and possibly be kicked out of college. After they talk, Josh and Tiffany agree to break up but remain friends. Josh and his friends head back to school and Josh arrives just in time to take his midterm ‚Äì with a little, albeit illegal, help from Beth. Barry closes the film, ending the visitors' tour by confirming to them that Josh passed the course; that Josh and Beth are still together, a happy couple still making videos; that Jacob eventually became leader of a cult and tried to stage a mass suicide, in which he ended up the only person to kill himself; that Rubin became a successful marijuana cultivator; and lastly relates humorous facts about E.L.'s and Kyle's futures. The credits roll while Barry has sex with a mother, from the tour group, in the middle of campus. Cast * Breckin Meyer as Josh Parker * Seann William Scott as E.L.

The film stars Chaney Kley and Emma Caulfield. The film follows Kyle Walsh (Kley), who witnesses his mother‚Äôs murder at the hands of the spirit of a woman lynched by an angry mob more than 150 years ago. Twelve years later, he returns to his childhood home because Michael Greene (Lee Cormie), the young brother of his romantic interest Caitlin (Caulfield), is being stalked by Kyle's mother‚Äôs supernatural killer. Kyle must protect them from this powerful enemy and put an end to its killing spree. Plot In the middle of the 19th century, in the town of Darkness Falls, elderly widow Matilda Dixon was adored by the town's children. She would give them a gold coin whenever they lost a tooth, earning her the nickname Tooth Fairy. One night, a fire broke out in her house and left her face disfigured and severely sensitive to light. She wore a white porcelain mask and would only leave her house at night. However, the town's adults were suspicious of Matilda, believing her to be a witch. When two children went missing, the town quickly turned on Matilda. They exposed her face to light and hanged her. Before her death, Matilda placed a curse on the town and swore revenge. When the two missing children returned home unharmed, the town realized their mistake and quickly buried Matilda's body, keeping their deed a secret. Over the next 150 years, the story of Matilda became the legend of the Tooth Fairy; her spirit visits children on the night they lose their last tooth. If anyone lays eyes upon her, they will forever be marked for her vengeance. In 1990, Kyle Walsh, an antisocial teenager befriended by Caitlin Greene (Emily Browning), loses his last baby tooth. That night, he wakes after a horrific nightmare and senses Matilda's presence, discovering that the story is true. Knowing she cannot bear the light, he shines a flashlight into her face and flees, hiding in the brightly lit bathroom. His mother tries to reassure him that there is nobody else in the house, but is killed after seeing Matilda in Kyle's room. The next morning, police arrive and Kyle is removed to a psychiatric institution after mistaken speculations that he killed his mother. Twelve years later, Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) telephones Kyle (Chaney Kley) to ask for his help with her younger brother Michael (Lee Cormie), who refuses to sleep in the dark. Kyle still suffers extreme paranoia from his encounter with Matilda; he has dozens of flashlights and numerous medications for anxiety, depression and sleep disorders. Kyle visits Michael at the hospital but denies any relation to his condition and walks away from Caitlin, who still believes that the legend of Matilda Dixon is just a story, one which they were all told as children, but a story nonetheless. Kyle tries to warn others of Matilda but faces ridicule and skepticism, which leads to the death of many townspeople. A lightning storm blacks out the whole town, and realizing that Michael and Caitlin are in danger, Kyle rushes to the hospital. He rescues them and gains allies along the way, as others see Matilda and realize the story is true. Kyle, Michael and Caitlin flee and hide in the lighthouse. They are helped by several medical personnel, all of whom are killed by Matilda. During his final confrontation with Matilda, power is restored and the lighthouse beacon is activated. The sudden exposure to light causes Matilda excruciating pain, and Kyle tears off her mask. Seeing her grotesque, disfigured face, he realizes she is now vulnerable. Enraged, she resumes her attack. Kyle sets his right sleeve on fire and he strikes her face with it. As her spirit is engulfed in flame, Matilda is destroyed and her curse is finally brought to an end. In a final scene, a young boy is being tucked into bed by his parents, having just lost his last baby tooth. As he sleeps, his mother replaces the tooth under his pillow with a gold coin, indicating that Matilda is gone and her curse is lifted.

She was a partner of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, with whom she had two children. She is a former Vice-Chancellor at the University of Cape Town and a one-time Managing Director at the World Bank.Mamphela Ramphele to the rescue? Daily Maverick Ramphele founded political party Agang South Africa in February 2013 but withdrew from politics in July 2014.  Early life  Ramphele was born in the Bochum District in Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo). She completed her schooling at Setotolwane High School in 1966 and subsequently enrolled for pre-medical courses at the University of the North. Her mother, Rangoato Rahab, and her father, Pitsi Eliphaz Ramphele were primary school teachers. In 1944, her father was promoted as headmaster of Stephanus Hofmeyer School. Ramphele contracted severe whooping cough at the age of three months. The wife of the local church minister, Dominee Lukas van der Merwe, gave her mother medical advice and bought medicines for the sick child that saved her life. In 1955, Ramphele witnessed a conflict between a racist Afrikaner church minister and the people of the village of Kranspoort. This contributed to her political awakening.  Education  Ramphele attended the G. H. Frantz Secondary School but in January 1962 she left for Bethesda Normal School, a boarding school which was part of the Bethesda teachers training college. In 1964, she moved to Setotolwane High School for her matriculation where she was one of only two girls in her class. On completion of her schooling in 1966, in 1967, Ramphele enrolled for pre-medical courses at the University of the North. In 1968, she was accepted into the University of Natal Medical School, then the only institution that allowed black students to enroll without prior permission from the government. Her meagre financial resources meant that she was forced to borrow money to travel to the Natal Medical School (now the Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Medical School). Ramphele won the 1968 South African Jewish Women‚Äôs Association Scholarship and the Sir Ernest Oppenheimer Bursary worth about R150 annually for the rest of her years at Medical School. Ramphele received her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) from the University of Natal, a BComm in Administration from the University of South Africa as well as diplomas in tropical health & hygiene and Public Health from the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1991 she received her PhD in Social Anthropology from the University of Cape Town. Ramphele has also authored and edited a number of books.  Activism  While at university, Ramphele became increasingly involved in student politics and anti-apartheid activism, becoming one of the founders of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM), where she met Steve Biko, with whom she had a relationship. As a member of the BCM, she was crucially involved in organising and working with community development programmes. Biko and Ramphele had two children during their affair; Lerato Biko, born in 1974, and Hlumelo Biko, born in 1978. Lerato contracted fatal pneumonia when she was two months old.Mothibeli, Tefo. \\"Mamphela Ramphele: Academic Giant and Ray of Hope\\" , Financial Mail, Johannesburg, 7 July 2006. Their son Hlumelo Biko was born after Biko's death.Daley, Suzanne. \\"The Standards Bearer\\", NY Times, New York, 13 April 1997. Ramphele and her son would eventually work together in the Circle Group holding company for their family investments. Ramphele worked with the South African Students' Organisation (SASO), a breakaway from the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) that operated on English-speaking white campuses. NUSAS had black and white students as members. SASO was formed in 1969 under the leadership of Steve Biko. From 1970 onwards Ramphele became increasingly drawn into political activism with Biko, Barney Pityana and other student activists at the Medical School. She was elected the chairperson of the local SASO branch. Ramphele received her qualification in medicine in 1972. She began her medical internship at Durban‚Äôs King Edward VIII Hospital, later transferring to Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth. In 1974, Ramphele was charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for being in possession of banned literature. In 1975, she founded the Zanempilo Community Health Care Centre in Zinyoka, a village outside King William‚Äôs Town. It was one of the first primary health care initiatives outside the public sector in South Africa. During this time she was also the manager of the Eastern Cape branch of the Black Community Health Programme. She travelled extensively in the Eastern Cape, organising people to be drawn into community projects. In addition to her medical duties, Ramphele also became the director of the Black Community Programmes (BCP) in the Eastern Cape when Biko was banned. In August 1976, Ramphele was detained under Section 10 of the Terrorism Act, one of the first persons to be detained under this newly promulgated law. In April 1977, Ramphele was issued with banning orders and banished to Tzaneen, Northern Transvaal, where she remained until 1984. A member of the local church arranged for her to live with two African nuns in a local village, Tickeyline. She later established a home for herself in Lenyenye township near Tzaneen, although she remained under police surveillance. During her stay in Tzaneen, Ramphele established the Isutheng Community Health Program, with monetary aid from the BCP. This foundation was used to empower local women, and aid them in growing vegetable gardens, amongst other initiatives. During her stay in Tzaneen, Ramphele enjoyed occasional illicit outings to escape everyday life, as well as visits from Helen Suzman, MP of the Progressive Party. Suzman assisted Ramphele in securing a passport when Ramphele travelled abroad. Ramphele also enjoyed visits from a Father Timothy Stanton; an Anglican priest who visited her and celebrated Eucharist with her. In 1983, she completed her BComm degree through UNISA (the University of South Africa), which she had registered for in 1975. She also completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Tropical Hygiene and a Diploma in Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand. This required that Ramphele apply for a special dispensation to travel to Johannesburg where she had to report at the John Vorster Square Police Station upon her arrival and departure. Ramphele left Lenyenye in 1984 to go to Port Elizabeth where she was offered a job at Livingstone Hospital. However, she left to take up an appointment at the University of Cape Town (UCT) that Francis Wilson, a Professor of Economics, had arranged. She was to work with him at the South African Development Research Unit (SALDRU) as a research fellow.  Career  Ramphele joined the University of Cape Town as a research fellow in 1986 and was appointed as one of its Deputy Vice-Chancellors in 1991. She was appointed to the post of Vice-Chancellor of the university in September 1996, thereby becoming the first black woman to hold such a position at a South African university. Part of her executive roles was to take charge of the university‚Äôs Equal Opportunity Policy Portfolio, with the aim of changing the culture of the institution. In 1994, Ramphele was a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. In 2000, Ramphele became one of the four Managing Directors of the World Bank. She was tasked with overseeing the strategic positioning and operations of the World Bank Institute as well as the Vice- Presidency of External Affairs. She is the first South African to hold this position. Ramphele serves as a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and served as the director of The Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) and as a board member of the Anglo-American Corporation, non- executive director of Medi Clinic Holdings and Transnet. Ramphele also served as a trustee for The Link SA fund, a charitable organisation that raises money to subsidise the tertiary education of South Africa's brightest underprivileged students. She was on the Board of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, an organisation that supports good governance and great leadership in Africa. She was voted 55th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. She is co- founder of ReimagineSA and in 2018 was voted co-president of The Club of Rome  Politics  In 2013, Ramphele expressed interest in returning to South African politics and resigned as the chairperson of Gold Fields. On 18 February 2013, she announced the formation of a new political party, named Agang South Africa (Agang is Northern Sotho for \\"Build\\"), intended to challenge the African National Congress.\\"Anti-Apartheid Leader Forms New Party in South Africa.\\" New York Times. 18 February 2013. Some critics have challenged Ramphele's drawing on Steve Biko's legacy in her political campaigns. On 28 January 2014, Ramphele accepted an invitation from the Democratic Alliance to stand as their presidential candidate in the 2014 general election. On 31 January 2014, Ramphele issued a statement saying that she would not take up Democratic Alliance party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February 2014, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the Democratic Alliance's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics. Agang South Africa won two seats in the National Assembly of South Africa. Following internal conflict within the party, Ramphele announced her withdrawal from politics on 8 July 2014.

The film stars John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall and Rebecca De Mornay. While the plot is not a direct adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1939 whodunit And Then There Were None (which was adapted for feature films in 1945, 1965, 1974, 1987 and 1989), the story draws from the structure of the novel. Ten strangers arrive at an isolated hotel, become temporarily cut off from the rest of the world, and are mysteriously killed off one by one. Several events which take place in the hours before the characters' arrival are introduced at key moments in the film using reverse chronology structure. Plot A convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for several vicious murders that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered mis-filed in the case evidence, not introduced during the trial. Malcolm's psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue that the evidence was intentionally suppressed by the prosecution and move to stay Rivers' execution, contending that Malcolm is legally insane. With this late evidence brought forth, a midnight hearing takes place, to determine if the journal is adequate evidence to grant their motion. Meanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in the middle of a torrential rainstorm at a remote Nevada motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, a washed-up, irritable actress; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a prostitute; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice and their nine-year-old son, Timmy, who are in crisis because Alice has been struck by Ed's car. With both ends of the road completely flooded, the group is forced to spend the night at the motel. Rhodes handcuffs Maine to a toilet in his room to prevent him from moving about freely. As everyone is settling down for the night, Suzanne is decapitated after she ventures out alone looking for a cell phone signal. Ed discovers her head in a dryer after waking up to a loud noise. He finds a number 10 key in the dryer, and Maine is suspected to be the killer when he, Rhodes, and Larry discover he has escaped. After Ed alerts everyone about Suzanne's death and Maine's escape, Lou and Ginny get into a fight, and they return to their room, arguing. Lou eventually is angered by the fact that Ginny had been lying to him about being pregnant, and Ginny locks herself in the bathroom to avoid him. After yelling back and forth between the door, Lou starts frantically banging as if he's terrified of something until he goes silent, and Ginny slowly unlocks the door only to see a silhouette of a knife wielding assailant approaching. She retreats to the bathroom again, and escapes out of the window. Rhodes, Paris, Ed, and Larry are alerted to her screams, and find Lou's corpse shortly after, stabbed to death. At the hearing, the contents of Malcolm's diaries are revealed, indicating Malcolm suffers from an extreme case of dissociative identity disorder, harboring eleven distinct personalities. His journal contains entries written by his different personalities, each with distinct handwriting and prose, as if they were the personal thoughts of several different people. His defense attorney argues that Malcolm is completely unaware of the crimes for which he is being executed, which is in violation of existing Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder, when Malcolm arrives, strapped into a wheelchair. While taking photos of Lou's crime scene and talking with Paris, Ed finds the number 9 key in Lou's bloody hands. He begins to suspect that the killer is counting down and targeting them in order. Meanwhile, Maine is making his escape over the wet terrain, but strangely finds himself right back at the motel. Rhodes spots Maine trying to hide and Ed helps subdue him during a struggle. They tie Maine to a pole and Larry is appointed to guard him. Not long after, Larry is found away from his post and Maine dead with Larry's bat sticking out of his throat in a grisly manner. Rhodes and Ed find the number 8 key next to Maine's body, and harass Larry, who grabs Paris and threatens to cut her if they keep blaming him for something he didn't do. Paris wrestles him off and the freezer is opened accidentally to reveal the frozen body of the real motel manager; Larry runs away and attempts to escape in a truck, accidentally crushing and killing George as he tried to save Timmy from being hit. The remaining survivors (except Alice, still in bed) tie Larry to a chair, and Rhodes tells them that they're going to stay together until dawn, or he'll shoot the next suspect. With eyes full of tears, Larry tells them the story of how he came upon the dead body of the manager and started running the motel for him, and how he wasn't the suspect, convincing Paris and Ed. Alice is then checked on and presumably has died from her injuries, but Rhodes finds the number 6 key. George's body is then stripped from its place and the number 7 key is found in his pocket, which confuses the remaining survivors. Against Rhodes' commands, Ed tells Ginny and Timmy to flee in a car near the edge of the motel, but it explodes, leaving no trace of Ginny or Timmy behind. The last four survivors discover that the bodies of all the previous victims have disappeared. Paris, yelling in hysterics at their unknown assailant, says that her birthday is the next week; it transpires that all eleven people were born on May 10 ‚Äî which is also Malcolm's birthday, and the day he committed the murders. Ed leaves the other three and checks their ID cards in the office, discovering that each one of them is named after a state, and that their birthdays all do indeed match. Ed begins to hear a voice call out to him, and as he listens he finds himself in a different building, strapped to a chair, with Dr. Malick calling out to him. Ed finds he is at the meeting to argue and postpone Malcolm's execution, but is confused as to why he's being told of the crimes and Malcolm Rivers' past. Dr. Malick explains that he is in fact one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child to cope with the abandonment and abuse he was subjected to. Informed that one of the personalities is the homicidal template that went on a killing spree, Ed is instructed to \\"go back\\" to the motel to try to eliminate this identity. Ed 'awakens' to find himself standing in the rain, looking at the motel from a distance. Paris finds convict- transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car. A flashback reveals that Rhodes killed the correctional officer transporting him and Maine, putting the officer's body in the trunk, and then assumed his identity. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is then shot twice and killed by Rhodes. Finally believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him after instructing Paris to hide, and they end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive. When Malick demonstrates that the homicidal personality is dead, Malcolm's execution is stayed and it is determined that he should be placed in a mental institution under Malick's care. In Malcolm's mind, Paris has driven back to her hometown in Frostproof, Florida. As she tends to some soil in her orange grove, she shakily discovers the number 1 key buried in the dirt, and finds Timmy behind her. Flashbacks reveal that Timmy orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, and made it appear that he had been killed with Ginny. Timmy kills Paris, while Malcolm strangles Malick, causing the van that is en route to the mental institution to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy's voice repeats the poem \\"Antigonish\\" by William Hughes Mearns one more time, now the sole personality of Malcolm Rivers.

The Rotorua lakes are located in New Zealand's North Island in the Bay of Plenty Region. Lake Rotoma is the easternmost in the chain of three lakes to the northeast of Lake Rotorua The other two are Lake Rotoiti and Lake Rotoehu. Rotoma is located halfway between the city of Rotorua and town of Whakatane. Lake Rotoma has a high water quality with visibility up to around 13 metres deep. The lake has a maximum depth of 83 metres in the northern part and 73.5 metres in the southern part. Geography Lake Rotoma was formed within the Rotoma caldera when lava flows from a large crater explosion blocked its outlet 9,500 years ago. The hills fringing the south and east of the lake are made up of Rhyolite from Haroharo and Tarawera, and this has meant that Lake Rotoma has no surface outlets. However, the presence of springs has suggested an underground discharge of lake waters. The water level of Rotoma reaches an excessive high or low level every 10‚Äì15 years. In times of extreme low levels, the sunken island \\"Motutara\\" in the lake may be exposed. History =Road= Tourists on the Rotoma hill. Drawn from a \\"Weekly News\\" photograph dated 9 May 1918 Before the road around Lake Rotoma was constructed, there were several MƒÅori trails over the Rotoma hill which could be used to get between Rotorua and the Eastern Bay of Plenty by foot, but these trails were too narrow and uneven to be used by horses. Travellers from Rotorua could only get as far as Tikitere on the rough track. In May 1895 work commenced on the Tikitere to Rotoma road. By July, there were three road gangs working on different sections of the road, and work began over the difficult section over the Rotoma hill in the summer of 1895‚Äì1896. A proper road was also constructed from Te Ngae in Rotorua through to Tikitere. Once the road was completed, horse-drawn traffic commenced and public coaching services began. The first such service was started in 1907 by the R.M. Company, who ran a service twice a week from Rotorua to Opotiki carrying mail and up to three passengers. In 1910 the R.M. Company upgraded to a large coach drawn by five horses which could hold 10 passengers. In 1916 Colletts of Rotorua started the first regular motor car service, using Cadillac service cars. The average travel time from Rotorua to Whakatane was 5 hours, but like the horse-drawn coaches, the service cars could take up to 9 hours to travel this distance depending on the driving conditions. The road surface gradually improved, decreasing the travel time to 3 hours by the late 1920s.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p.70 Today, this journey takes just one hour and 20 minutes. In 1947, 60 men were employed on the construction of the Rotorua to Whakatane highway, as increases in traffic had caused problems on the road which was barely 12 feet wide. In the winter of 1956 the lake level of Rotoma rose very high, causing the road to be shifted to higher ground. More serious flooding occurred in 1962, and the famous \\"cheese cutting\\" landmark was destroyed and used to build up the road. The cheese cutting was a large wedge shaped rock formed during road construction in 1895‚Äì1896 when the road gangs cut the road through a hill with picks and shovels and left a portion of the hill standing.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p.73 =Establishments= Drawing of travellers outside J.Baker's Tearooms and Post Office at Lake Rotoma, c1900 Various establishments have come and gone at Rotoma, and most were set up to service the passing traveller's desire for rest stops, refreshments and accommodation.

The changing station at the west end of Rotoma became a popular rest stop. John Baker ran a post office and tearooms here, and built up a reputation for his corned beef. Mr. Baker offered the traveller a choice of corned beef with potatoes and cabbage or corned beef sandwiches.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p. 70 The Pilbrow family arrived in Rotoma in 1948 after purchasing the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office. They expanded the business to include a general store, and renamed it The Kettle Store and Tearooms. They then built a garage for motor repairs, and the business became The Kettle Store and Garage. Petrol pumps were later installed by the Pilbrow family to create T & K Filling Station. There was an extremely high level of rainfall in 1961 which caused serious flooding problems, and the business was badly affected. The floodwater raised the petrol tanks out of the ground and the road had to be built up to act as a stop-bank. A pump was in action 24 hours a day for weeks to prevent the water from completely flooding the premises.Chapman, V.J. (1978). Lake Rotoma School 50th Jubilee 1928‚Äì1978 Ian Bryce Ltd, pg. 3 The Pilbrow family also created Oxford Road. The original homestead which became known as Atkinson's Fishing Lodge was built early in the 1900s by Mr and Mrs C. Atkinson who farmed near the lake and had an orchard on the opposite side of the road. The homestead was turned into a lodge which became very popular with fishermen. The lodge was renamed Merge Lodge by Geoff and Roy Warwick, formerly of Kawerau, who took over ownership in 1960. The lodge had six bedrooms, a billiard room, two kitchens, two lounges, and a store out the front.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History.

The real story was lost over time, with the majority of Rotoma local residents holding the belief that it had been a young honeymoon couple who committed suicide there together. However, in actuality it was a 38-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl; understood to have been romantically attached. The man, Carl Olsen, had told the girl's father of his love for her. In an attempt to separate the pair, the disapproving parents sent the girl, Molly Moors, to live with an aunt in Hastings. Without her aunts knowledge, Olsen picked Molly up in his car and it was assumed they were on their way to Hamilton when they met death at the shores of Rotoma. The event was well covered by newspapers of the time and was referred to as the \\"Rotoma Tragedy\\". Olsen and Moors are buried next to each other in the Rotorua Cemetery, and their graves were probably originally marked with wooden crosses.Rotorua District Council Cemetery Search Accessed 25 March 2011. The original crosses disintegrated over time leaving the two graves unmarked for many years before being remarked with new matching wooden crosses in May 2011. =Sunken island= Four buoys in the southern portion of Lake Rotoma mark the location of Motutara, the sunken island, which sits just under the lakes surface. Occasionally the lake level drops low enough to expose the top of the island. There was once a MƒÅori village on the island, and according to the legend, an old Tohunga resided there amongst the other inhabitants. His name was Te Rarau-mai-Waho, and he was very powerful and dangerous. The cloud the old Tohunga cast over the island was lifted only on the occasions where he went to visit some of his relations in Kawerau and around Putauaki, Mount Edgecumbe. One night he returned from such a visit and called out to the people of the island from the lake's edge by Matahi lagoon, ordering them to send him a canoe. Nobody responded to his demands, and in his anger the Tohunga put a curse on the island and its inhabitants. The people of the island heard the angry Tohunga's terrible screams, but did not realise the horrible retribution he would take. The curse caused the island to slowly sink, and by morning it was completely underwater; the only signs of the village being bodies and pieces of wreckage floating on the surface of the lake. Some people had escaped by swimming to the shore of the lake, and these people eventually settled in the South Island.Chapman, V.J. (1978). Lake Rotoma School 50th Jubilee 1928‚Äì1978 Ian Bryce Ltd, pg. 8 The Waikato Underwater Club has examined Motutara. Two platforms or terraces were found, and some hƒÅngi stones were found at the peak. It has been suggested that if the PƒÅ had been palisaded it may have still been there today.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p. 62 Settlement The 2006 census revealed that 1,863 people usually live in the wider Rotoma area; 0.7 percent of Bay of Plenty Region's population. However, the lakeside portion of the Rotoma area has a much smaller permanent population, as many of the dwellings are used only as holiday homes. The most common ethnic group in the wider Rotoma area is MƒÅori, at 49.9% of the population. This compares to a 27.5% Maori population for the Bay of Plenty Region as a whole.Statistics New Zealand New Zealand Census 2006 data, Accessed 20 June 2011 =Early settlement= The early road construction crews commented on the lack of Maori settlement in Rotoma and in the neighbouring Lake Rotoehu. However, fortified pƒÅ sites, food pits, cultivation areas and burial sites have been discovered around Rotomas shorelines and the surrounding hills . The tribe NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa may not have lived permanently at Rotoma but at least took out a temporary camping existence there to take advantage of the hunting and fishing opportunities on offer. Later, Ngati Tuahuriri, a sub-tribe of Ngati Pikiao took up residence at Rotoma. The Rotoiti natives credit the native and European wars as the cause of the dispersion of this Maori population, and they had left Lake Rotoma by the time the road construction began in 1895. A census for the years 1874 to 1891 shows nil for Rotoma. In 1896 a census shows a population of 33, understood to be the occupants of the camp set up for the road workers and their families at the east end of Oneroa beach by the lagoon. =Oxford Road= In 1948, Mr and Mrs T.H. Pilbrow and their children arrived at Lake Rotoma from Oxford in Canterbury. They had purchased the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office, which was situated on 25 acres of land. In a district of predominantly leasehold land, the Pilbrows realised the value of their 25 acres of freehold land and decided to subdivide it in 1950. Sixty-three sections were surveyed, the majority each a quarter acre, and four of these were taken by the Rotorua County Council for a reserve. Seventeen sections were along the main road, but a new road was required to access the sections to the rear. The Pilbrows named the new road \\"Oxford Road\\" as a reminder of their hometown.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p. 76-77 Education Lake Rotoma School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . The first school was opened on 2 February 1928 in the old tearooms building with Mr. E.G. Sutherland teaching the 8 students. Mr Sutherland stated that it was \\"probably the worst building in New Zealand. However, when the weather was too bad we just declared a holiday ‚Äì and nobody seemed to worry\\" A new school was built and opened in its present location on Soda Springs Road on 25 May 1936 with 29 students.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p. 74 The roll fluctuated due to numerous residents living at Rotoma on a temporary basis. The mills in the area, Tunnicliffe's Mill and Rendall's Mill, helped establish a more stable population at Rotoma and caused further overcrowding at the school. In 1973 the roll reached 55 and there were appalling working conditions for staff and children. On 14 August 1973 the majority of parents kept their children at home as a protest against the lack of action to improve standards. There was widespread media coverage and in October the Minister of Education ordered that a new school be built, and it was opened on 16 November 1974. From 1948, Mr Tam Pilbrow operated the first bus service to the school, using a Hillman car.Moore, K.W. (1998). \\"Lake Rotoma\\". Historical Review: Bay of Plenty Journal of History. Volume 46, Number 2, p. 75 In 1952 the service was taken over by George Graham, and Mr. Pilbrow's son Ken, who operated a Bradford van from the Kettle Store. Mr Gavin Wyllie bought the Kettle Store and Garage, and in 1958 he commenced transporting children to the school in his V.W combie van, but when Rendall's Mill closed at the end of that same year, there were not enough children for him to continue the service.Chapman, V.J.

For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the \\"return to order\\" in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions.  Early life  Gino Severini, 1910‚Äì11, La Modiste (The Milliner), oil on canvas, 64.8 x 48.3 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art Severini was born into a poor family in Cortona, Italy. His father was a junior court official and his mother a dressmaker. He studied at the Scuola Tecnica in Cortona until the age of fifteen, when he and a group of fellow- classmates were expelled from the entire Italian school system for the attempted theft of exam papers. For a while he worked with his father; then in 1899 he moved to Rome with his mother. It was there that he first showed a serious interest in art, painting in his spare time while working as a shipping clerk. With the help of a patron of Cortonese origins he attended art classes, enrolling in the free school for nude studies (an annex of the Rome Fine Art Institute) and a private academy. His formal art education ended after two years when his patron stopped his allowance, declaring, \\"I absolutely do not understand your lack of order.\\"Severini, G., The Life of a Painter, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995.

Together they visited the studio of Giacomo Balla, where they were introduced to the technique of Divisionism, painting with adjacent rather than mixed colors and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. The ideas of Divisionism had a great influence on Severini's early work and on Futurist painting from 1910 to 1911. Severini settled in Paris in November 1906. The move was momentous for him. He said later, \\"The cities to which I feel most strongly bound are Cortona and Paris: I was born physically in the first, intellectually and spiritually in the second.\\"Fonti, D., Severini, Florence, Giunti, 1995. He lived in Montmartre and dedicated himself to painting. There he met most of the rising artists of the period, befriending Amedeo Modigliani and occupying a studio next to those of Raoul Dufy, Georges Braque and Suzanne Valadon. He knew most of the Parisian avant-garde, including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso, Lugn√©-Poe and his theatrical circle, the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Fort, Max Jacob, and author Jules Romains. The sale of his work did not provide enough to live on and he depended on the generosity of patrons. Futurism He was invited by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Boccioni to join the Futurist movement and was a co-signatory, with Balla, Boccioni, Carlo Carr√†, and Luigi Russolo, of the Manifesto of the Futurist Painters in February 1910 and the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting in April the same year. He was an important link between artists in France and Italy and came into contact with Cubism before his Futurist colleagues. Following a visit to Paris in 1911, the Italian Futurists adopted a sort of Cubism, which gave them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism. Severini helped to organize the first Futurist exhibition outside Italy at Galerie Bernheim- Jeune, Paris, in February 1912 and participated in subsequent Futurist shows in Europe and the United States. In 1913, he had solo exhibitions at the Marlborough Gallery, London, and Der Sturm, Berlin; it was during the show in London when he met and befriended British artist C. R. W. Nevinson, ultimately leading to the latter's decision to become a fellow Futurist. In his autobiography, written many years later, he records that the Futurists were pleased with the response to the exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, but that influential critics, notably Apollinaire, mocked them for their pretensions, their ignorance of the main currents of modern art and their provincialism. Severini later came to agree with Apollinaire. Severini was less attracted to the subject of the machine than his fellow Futurists and frequently chose the form of the dancer to express Futurist theories of dynamism in art. He was particularly adept at rendering lively urban scenes, for example in Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin (1912) and The Boulevard (1913). During the First World War he produced some of the finest Futurist war art, notably his Italian Lancers at a Gallop (1915) and Armoured Train (1915). Crystal Cubism and Neo-classicism In 1916 Severini departed from Futurism and painted several works in a naturalistic style inspired by his interest in early Renaissance art.Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer (1990).On Classic Ground: Picasso, L√©ger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910‚Äì1930. London: Tate Gallery. After the First World War, Severini gradually abandoned the Futurist style and painted in a synthetic Crystal Cubist style until 1920.Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47 By 1920 he was applying theories of classical balance based on the Golden Section to still lifes and figurative subjects from the traditional commedia dell'arte. He became part of the \\"return to order\\" in the arts in the post-war era. Works such as The Two Pulchinellas (1922) exemplify Severini's turn toward a more conservative, analytic type of painting, which nonetheless suggests metaphysical overtones. After 1920, Severini divided his time between Paris and Rome. In 1921, he was commissioned by George Sitwell to paint murals for Montefugoni castle, which the latter had bought in 1909; the same year, Severini published Du cubisme au classicisme: Esth√©tique du compas et du nombre, a book summarizing his research into mathematical theories of harmony and proportion.Severini, G: From Cubism to Classicism (together with Albert Gleizes: Painting and its Laws), translation, introduction and notes by Peter Brooke, London, Francis Boutle publishers, 2001, The murals were completed in 1922.Severini, Gino, The Life of a Painter (Princeton, 1995); fig. 44 to 47 In 1923 and 1925 he took part in the Rome Biennale. He exhibited in Milan with artists of the Novecento Italiano group in 1926 and 1929 and in their Geneva exhibition of 1929. From 1928 he began to incorporate elements of Rome's classical landscape in his work. In 1930 he took part in the Venice Biennale, exhibited in the Rome Quadrennials of 1931 and 1935, and in 1935 won the first prize for painting, with an entire room devoted to his work. He contributed a cycle of works to the Paris Exhibition. He explored fresco and mosaic techniques and executed murals in various media in Switzerland, France, and Italy. During this decade, he taught the Swiss printmaker Lill Tschudi, who had previously studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art. Later life In the 1940s Severini's style became semi-abstract. In the 1950s he returned to his Futurist subjects: dancers, light and movement. He executed commissions for the church of Saint-Pierre in Freiburg and inaugurated the Cons√©gna delle Chiavi (\\"Delivery of the Keys\\") mosaic. His mosaics were shown at the Cahiers d'Art gallery in Paris and he participated in a conference on the history of mosaic at Ravenna. He received commissions to decorate the offices of KLM in Rome and Alitalia in Paris and took part in the exhibition The Futurists, Balla - Severini 1912‚Äì1918 at the Rose Fried Gallery in New York. In Rome he reconstructed his Pan Pan Dance mosaic, which had been destroyed in the war. He was awarded the Premio Nazionale di Pittura of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, exhibited at the 9th Rome Quadrennal and was given a solo exhibition at the Accademia di San Luca. Throughout his career he published important theoretical essays and books on art. In 1946 he published an autobiography, The Life of a Painter. Severini died in Paris on 26 February 1966, aged 82. He was buried at Cortona.

It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat G√§llivare. Malmberget is known as a major site for the extraction of iron ore from deep mines by the company LKAB. The iron ore mining started in 1741 at the Illuvaara mountain, later known as Gellivare malmberg and eventually just Malmberget. The first train which transported iron ore was loaded in 1888 - this was the beginning of the great iron ore rush which would change the entire area of Northern Lapland. In Malmberget there was plentiful employment, but no dwellings - a striking resemblance to the conditions during some of the gold rushes in North America. During the first years, workers lived in shacks built from wasted dynamite crates. Right down the centre of Malmberget, the deep mine has reached daylight and thus created a huge hole called Kaptensgropen (\\"The Captain's Pit\\"). In March 2012, Kaptensgropen was joined with a new pit resulting from the 'Fabian'-deposit caving in as planned, and has grown southwards as the deep mining continues, and thus divided the town while making the old town centre uninhabitable and forcing many institutions (e.g. the two existing cinemas and the church) to move to the western part of Malmberget or, even more commonly, to the neighbouring town of G√§llivare. Today Kaptensgropen is being filled up with stone which is dug up as a by-product from the underground mines. Kaptensgropen will eventually be filled in, but the uninhabitable area is continually growing as underground mining undermines the area and seismic events caused by the mining regularly shake the remaining parts of Malmberget. The future of Malmberget is currently uncertain, but prospecting by LKAB indicates that even more of Malmberget may have to move in the future. The moving of several large residential houses owned by the mining company, as well as private villas, has been a major issue locally for the past few years. The iron ore extracted from Malmberget is mainly transported by rail southeast to the port of Lule√•. (See Swedish iron ore during World War II). Sports Malmberget's largest sports association is named Malmbergets allm√§nna idrottsf√∂rening (MAIF). MAIF's colors are green and white and has an athletic tradition spanning more than a hundred years. The local football club is G√§llivare Malmbergets FF.

ETS is used to treat excessive sweating in certain parts of the body (focal hyperhidrosis), facial blushing, Raynaud's disease and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. By far the most common complaint treated with ETS is sweaty palms (palmar hyperhidrosis). The intervention is controversial and illegal in some jurisdictions. Like any surgical procedure, it has risks; the endoscopic sympathetic block (ESB) procedure and those procedures that affect fewer nerves have lower risks. Sympathectomy physically destroys relevant nerves anywhere in either of the two sympathetic trunks, which are long chains of nerve ganglia located bilaterally along the vertebral column (a localisation which entails a low risk of injury) responsible for various important aspects of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Each nerve trunk is broadly divided into three regions: cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), and lumbar (lower back). The most common area targeted in sympathectomy is the upper thoracic region, that part of the sympathetic chain lying between the first and fifth thoracic vertebrae. Indications The most common indications for thoracic sympathectomy are focal hyperhidrosis (that specifically affects the hands and underarms), Raynaud syndrome, and facial blushing when accompanied by focal hyperhidrosis. It may also be used to treat bromhidrosis, although this usually responds to non-surgical treatments, and sometimes people with olfactory reference syndrome present to surgeons requesting sympathectomy. There are reports of ETS being used to achieve cerebral revascularization for people with moyamoya disease, and to treat headaches, hyperactive bronchial tubes, long QT syndrome,Ventricular Arrhythmia/ Tachycardia social phobia, anxiety, and other conditions. Surgical procedure A custom made operating thoracoscope, used for the endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy procedure. ETS involves dissection of the main sympathetic trunk in the upper thoracic region of the sympathetic nervous system, irreparably disrupting neural messages that ordinarily would travel to many different organs, glands and muscles. It is via those nerves that the brain is able to make adjustments to the body in response to changing conditions in the environment, fluctuating emotional states, level of exercise, and other factors to maintain the body in its ideal state (see homeostasis). Because these nerves also regulate conditions like excessive blushing or sweating, which the procedure is designed to eliminate, the normative functions these physiological mechanisms perform will be disabled or significantly impaired by sympathectomy. There is much disagreement among ETS surgeons about the best surgical method, optimal location for nerve dissection, and the nature and extent of the consequent primary effects and side effects. When performed endoscopically as is usually the case, the surgeon penetrates the chest cavity making multiple incisions about the diameter of a straw between ribs. This allows the surgeon to insert the video camera (endoscope) in one hole and a surgical instrument in another. The operation is accomplished by dissecting the nerve tissue of the main sympathetic chain. Another technique, the clamping method, also referred to as 'endoscopic sympathetic blockade' (ESB) employs titanium clamps around the nerve tissue, and was developed as an alternative to older methods in an unsuccessful attempt to make the procedure reversible. Technical reversal of the clamping procedure must be performed within a short time after clamping (estimated at a few days or weeks at most), and a recovery, evidence indicates, will not be complete. Physical, mental and emotional effects Sympathectomy works by disabling part of the autonomic nervous system (and thereby disrupting its signals from the brain), through surgical intervention, in the expectation of removing or alleviating the designated problem. Many non-ETS doctors have found this practice questionable chiefly because its purpose is to destroy functionally disordered, yet anatomically typical nerves. Exact results of ETS are impossible to predict, because of considerable anatomic variation in nerve function from one patient to the next, and also because of variations in surgical technique. The autonomic nervous system is not anatomically exact and connections might exist which are unpredictably affected when the nerves are disabled. This problem was demonstrated by a significant number of patients who underwent sympathectomy at the same level for hand sweating, but who then presented a reduction or elimination of feet sweating, in contrast to others who were not affected in this way. No reliable operation exists for foot sweating except lumbar sympathectomy, at the opposite end of the sympathetic chain. Thoracic sympathectomy will change many bodily functions, including sweating, vascular responses, heart rate, heart stroke volume, thyroid, baroreflex, lung volume, pupil dilation, skin temperature and other aspects of the autonomic nervous system, like the essential fight-or-flight response. It reduces the physiological responses to strong emotions, such as fear and laughter, diminishes the body's physical reaction to both pain and pleasure, and inhibits cutaneous sensations such as goose bumps. A large study of psychiatric patients treated with this surgery showed significant reductions in fear, alertness and arousal.Teleranta, Pohjavaara, et al. 2003, 2004 Arousal is essential to consciousness, in regulating attention and information processing, memory and emotion. ETS patients are being studied using the autonomic failure protocol headed by David Goldstein, M.D. Ph.D., senior investigator at the U.S National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He has documented loss of thermoregulatory function, cardiac denervation, and loss of vasoconstriction. Recurrence of the original symptoms due to nerve regeneration or nerve sprouting can occur within the first year post surgery. Nerve sprouting, or abnormal nerve growth after damage or injury to the nerves can cause other further damage. Sprouting sympathetic nerves can form connections with sensory nerves, and lead to pain conditions that are mediated by the SNS. Every time the system is activated, it is translated into pain. This sprouting and its action can lead to Frey's syndrome, a recognized after effect of sympathectomy, when the growing sympathetic nerves innervate salivary glands, leading to excessive sweating regardless of environmental temperature through olfactory or gustatory stimulation. In addition, patients have reported lethargy, depression, weakness, limb swelling, lack of libido, decreased physical and mental reactivity, oversensitivity to sound, light and stress and weight gain. (British Journal of Surgery 2004; 91: 264‚Äì269)  Risks  ETS has both the normal risks of surgery, such as bleeding and infection, conversion to open chest surgery, and several specific risks, including permanent and unavoidable alteration of nerve function. It is reported that a number of patients - 9 since 2010, mostly young women - have died during this procedure due to major intrathoracic bleeding and cerebral disruption. Bleeding during and following the operation may be significant in up to 5% of patients. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) can occur (2% of patients). Compensatory hyperhidrosis (or reflex hyperhidrosis) is common over the long term. The rates of severe compensatory sweating vary widely between studies, ranging from as high as 92% of patients. Of those patients that develop this side effect, about a quarter in one study said it was a major and disabling problem. A severe possible consequence of thoracic sympathectomy is corposcindosis (split-body syndrome), in which the patient feels that he or she is living in two separate bodies, because sympathetic nerve function has been divided into two distinct regions, one dead, and the other hyperactive. Additionally, the following side effects have all been reported by patients: Chronic muscular pain, numbness and weakness of the limbs, Horner's Syndrome, anhidrosis (inability to sweat), hyperthermia (exacerbated by anhidrosis and systemic thermoregulatory dysfunction), neuralgia, paraesthesia, fatigue and amotivationality, breathing difficulties, substantially diminished physiological/chemical reaction to internal and environmental stimuli, somatosensory malfunction, aberrant physiological reaction to stress and exertion, Raynaud‚Äôs disease (albeit a possible indication for surgery), reflex hyperhidrosis, altered/erratic blood pressure and circulation, defective fight or flight response system, loss of adrenaline, eczema and other skin conditions resulting from exceptionally dry skin, rhinitis, gustatory sweating (also known as Frey's syndrome). A thermal image of an ETS patient 2 years after surgery, showing corposcindosis (split-body syndrome) Other long-term adverse effects include: * Ultrastructural changes in the cerebral artery wall induced by long-term sympathetic denervation * Sympathectomy eliminates the psychogalvanic reflex * Cervical sympathectomy reduces the heterogeneity of oxygen saturation in small cerebrocortical veins * Sympathetic denervation is one of the causes of M√∂nckeberg's sclerosis * T2-3 sympathectomy suppressed baroreflex control of heart rate in the patients with palmar hyperhidrosis. The baroreflex response for maintaining cardiovascular stability is suppressed in the patients who received the ETS. * Exertional heat stroke. * Morphofunctional changes in the myocardium following sympathectomy. Other side effects are the inability to raise the heart rate sufficiently during exercise with instances requiring an artificial pacemaker after developing bradycardia being reported as a consequence of the surgery. The Finnish Office for Health Care Technology Assessment concluded more than a decade ago in a 400-page systematic review that ETS is associated with an unusually high number of significant immediate and long-term adverse effects. Quoting the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare statement: \\"The method can give permanent side effects that in some cases will first become obvious only after some time. One of the side effects might be increased perspiration on different places on your body. Why and how this happens is still unknown. According to the research available about 25-75% of all patients can expect more or less serious perspiration on different places on their body, such as the trunk and groin area, this is Compensatory sweating\\". In 2003, ETS was banned in its birthplace, Sweden, due to inherent risks, and complaints by disabled patients. In 2004, Taiwanese health authorities banned the procedure on people under 20 years of age. History Sympathectomy developed in the mid-19th century, when it was learned that the autonomic nervous system runs to almost every organ, gland and muscle system in the body. It was surmised that these nerves play a role in how the body regulates many different body functions in response to changes in the external environment, and in emotion. The first sympathectomy was performed by Alexander in 1889. Thoracic sympathectomy has been indicated for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) since 1920, when Kotzareff showed it would cause anhidrosis (total inability to sweat) from the nipple line upwards. A lumbar sympathectomy was also developed and used to treat excessive sweating of the feet and other ailments, and typically resulted in impotence and retrograde ejaculation in men. Lumbar sympathectomy is still being offered as a treatment for plantar hyperhidrosis, or as a treatment for patients who have a bad outcome (extreme 'compensatory sweating') after thoracic sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis or blushing; however, extensive sympathectomy risks hypotension. Endoscopic sympathectomy itself is relatively easy to perform; however, accessing the nerve tissue in the chest cavity by conventional surgical methods was difficult, painful, and spawned several different approaches in the past. The posterior approach was developed in 1908, and required resection (sawing off) of ribs. A supraclavicular (above the collar-bone) approach was developed in 1935, which was less painful than the posterior, but was more prone to damaging delicate nerves and blood vessels. Because of these difficulties, and because of disabling sequelae associated with sympathetic denervation, conventional or \\"open\\" sympathectomy was never a popular procedure, although it continued to be practiced for hyperhidrosis, Raynaud's disease, and various psychiatric disorders. With the brief popularization of lobotomy in the 1940s, sympathectomy fell out of favor as a form of psychosurgery. The endoscopic version of thoracic sympathectomy was pioneered by Goren Claes and Christer Drott in Sweden in the late 1980s. The development of endoscopic \\"minimally invasive\\" surgical techniques has decreased the recovery time from the surgery and increased its availability. Today, ETS surgery is practiced in many countries throughout the world predominantly by vascular surgeons.

The screenplay by David Klass is based on James Patterson's best- selling 1995 novel of the same name. A sequel titled Along Came a Spider was released in 2001. Plot Washington, D.C. detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross heads to Durham, North Carolina when his niece Naomi, a college student, is reported missing. He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home. When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient. Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross's efforts to capture and question Rudolph are foiled when Rudolph escapes. In North Carolina, Cross traces Casanova up the river. Alerted by a gunshot, he discovers Casanova's underground hideout. Rudolph is revealed to be Casanova's partner. Casanova escapes, while Rudolph is shot by Cross. Cross rescues the kidnapped women, including Naomi. Later, Kate invites Cross to dinner at her house. Ruskin drops by Kate's house and sends home the two officers guarding her. While Cross is at home preparing to meet Kate for dinner, he discovers that Ruskin's signature on the arrest warrants matches Casanova's handwriting. Cross tries calling Kate to inform her, but Ruskin has already disconnected her phone line. Kate becomes suspicious of Ruskin while conversing with him. He then drops his accent, revealing he is Casanova. After a fight and attempted rape, Kate manages to handcuff him to the oven. Ruskin slashes Kate's arm with a kitchen knife. In attempting to free himself, Ruskin pulls the oven away from the wall, rupturing the gas pipe. Ruskin takes out a lighter, threatening to cause an explosion due to the leaking gas. Cross shows up and tries to discourage Ruskin. When this fails, Cross shoots Ruskin, firing through a milk carton to avoid igniting the gas. Cross comforts Kate as the police arrive.

The film shot two weeks on location in North Carolina on the streets of Durham, in nearby county parks, and outside a Chapel Hill, North Carolina residence. The police station was constructed in a downtown Durham warehouse. The majority of filming occurred in the Los Angeles area, with locations including the Disney Ranch, The Athenaeum at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, a house in the Adams historic district of Los Angeles, and on the campus of the University of Southern California in University Park. Designed by American production designer Nelson Coates, the majority of the sets, including the tunnels and underground chambers, were constructed in sound stages on the Paramount Studios lot. Filming was completed on July 10, 1996. Release The film premiered at the Deauville Film Festival in September 1997 before opening on 2,271 screens in the US the following month. It earned $13,215,167 in its opening weekend and a total of $60,527,873 in the US, ranking #30 in domestic revenue for the year. The film was not shown in some theaters in central Virginia at the time of release, due to the unsolved murders of three teenage girls in the area. This decision was out of respect for the families and surrounding communities. The murders were eventually solved and attributed to Richard Evonitz. Reception =Critical reception= The film received negative reviews and has a \\"Rotten\\" rating of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes from 32 reviews with the consensus: \\"Detective Alex Cross makes his inauspicious cinematic debut in Kiss the Girls, a clunky thriller that offers few surprises.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film \\"is cut from the same cloth as The Silence of the Lambs, but the piece of material it uses has the uneven shape and dangling threads of a discarded remnant.... [It] begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic.\\" Holden writes of Morgan Freeman that he \\"projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie's fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes you want to believe in the movie much more than its gimmicky jerry-rigged [sic] plot ever permits.\\"\\"'Kiss the Girls': Casanova Complex: Collecting for the Kill\\". The New York Times, October 3, 1997. In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars and said, \\"David Klass, the screenwriter, gives Freeman and Judd more specific dialogue than is usual in thrillers; they sound as if they might actually be talking with each other and not simply advancing plot points.... [They] are so good, you almost wish they'd decided not to make a thriller at all - had simply found a way to construct a drama exploring their personalities.\\"\\"Kiss the Girls\\". Chicago Sun-Times, October 3, 1997. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \\"a tense, scary, perversely creepy thriller\\" and added, \\"David Klass ... blessedly deletes the graphic descriptions of torture and rape included in the novel. Unfortunately, he also neglects to include any explanation of Casanova's behavior. Otherwise Kiss the Girls does what it's supposed to do.

Headlam was a pioneer and publicist of Christian socialism, on which he wrote a pamphlet for the Fabian Society, and a supporter of Georgism. He is noted for his role as the founder and warden of the Guild of St Matthew and for helping to bail Oscar Wilde from prison at the time of his trials. Early years and education Headlam was born on 12 January 1847 in Wavertree, near Liverpool, the elder son and third of four children of Thomas Duckworth Headlam, underwriter of Liverpool. His parental home was strictly evangelical, though not narrow or severe, but Headlam rejected with horror the doctrine of eternal punishment. From 1860-65 (ages 13‚Äì18) Headlam attended Eton College. There he was influenced by a teacher, William Johnson, who was a disciple of the Christian Socialism of Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley. When he attended Cambridge University, Headlam was taught by the Professor of Moral Theology, F. D. Maurice, the primary influence in his life. Headlam came to agree with Maurice that God's Kingdom on earth would replace a \\"competitive, unjust society with a co-operative and egalitarian social order.\\" Maurice's teaching and example shaped Headlam's life, starting with his decision to be ordained. Years later, Headlam told colleagues in the Fabian Society: that he had been delivered from \\"the belief that a large proportion of the human race are doomed to endless misery\\" by Maurice's teachings. Maurice instilled a \\"Christian humanism\\" in Headlam. In his Fabian Society Tract on \\"Christian Socialism,\\" Headlam wrote, \\"I learnt the principles and was familiar with the title of 'Christian Socialism' from Maurice and Kingsley.\\" Ordination and parish ministry After Headlam took his degree from Cambridge in 1868, his father arranged with an Evangelical cleric, Herbert James, to give further training before ordination. But Headlam was not open to the teaching. James said, it was \\"impossible to budge\\" Headlam from his convictions based on Maurice's teachings. Headlam received another years training under Charles Vaughan who recommended him for ordination as a deacon and found him a curacy at St John's, Drury Lane, London. Headlam was ordained deacon by Bishop John Jackson in 1869 and in 1871 as priest. His ordination as a priest was delayed by Jackson because of his reservations about Headlam's beliefs. Headlam had five parish assignments, but he was dismissed from all of them. He was never \\"beneficed\\" and after being \\"constantly dismissed\\" with no curacy he could hold services only when friendly clergy invited him. =St John's Church, Drury Lane: 1869‚Äì1873= Hedlam's first curacy was at St John's Church in Drury Lane. William Graham Maul was the vicar from 1855 to 1882. Maul and Headlam had much in common. They were both friends of the Christian socialists F. D. Maurice and Charles Kingsley who had attracted them to Christian socialism. At St John's, Headlam's special ministries were \\"church catechist\\" and making pastoral visits. The parishioners to whom Headlam ministered included \\"working people, actors, actresses, and artisans\\". Among these people, there were \\"music-hall dancers\\". These parishioners, Headlam observed, were \\"the victims of prejudice\\" and often \\"cold-shouldered\\" by other parishioners. Headlam, who was \\"notorious for his defence of the down-trodden of every sort,\\" set out to remedy the situation by making dancing socially acceptable. Headlam recognized that social acceptance of dance depended on \\"an appreciation of ballet as an autonomous aesthetic form\\". He adopted a threefold strategy to accomplish this goal: (1) provide an \\"authoritative exposition of the dance technique itself\\", (2) form the Church and Stage Guild, and (3) formulate a theology of dance. In spite of what they had in common, Headlam fell foul of Maul who asked him to leave the parish in 1873. It was not only, or even mainly, a matter of dogma. He outraged respectable Victorian society by his public championing of the poor and his denunciations of the uncaring rich. =St Matthew's, Bethnal Green: 1873‚Äì1878= In 1873, Headlam left Drury Lane for St Matthew's, Bethnal Green. Bethnal Green was an area of extreme poverty and Headlam was assigned to the most impoverished area. The rector of the church, Septimus Hansard, was another Christian socialist who influenced the ideas of Headlam. Working with Hansard gave added \\"practical content\\" to Headlam's \\"socialist ideas\\". The clergy usually lived outside St Matthew's parish, but Headlam \\"rented a flat in a working-class building.\\" Although Headlam lived \\"among\\" his people, he did not live \\"like\\" them. His \\"independent means\\" enabled him to furnish his rooms in an \\"individual style.\\" By 1875, \\"men and their needs now became the centre of [Headlam's] Christianity\\". Living near the church Headlam saw the \\"degradation and suffering\\" of the workers. Having seen this, Headlam told the St Matthew's congregation that when people are \\"not fed so as to grow up and healthily\\", it is a \\"witness against the Church\\" that she has \\"neglected her primary duty\\". Poor attendance at church; good attendance at theatres; Headlam's defence St. Matthew's, Bethnal Green, was noted for poor attendance. \\"The poor of Bethnal Green spent their Sunday mornings sleeping and the remainder of the day at the dancing room, the music hall, or the beer shop.\\" \\"Headlam was determined to win them back for Christ, beginning with the young people.\\" He made Sunday School more interesting and made it coeducational. Headlam also went to see the \\"cheap theatres\\" his parishioners attended rather than church services. This research was documented in a pamphlet. The problem for Headlam was that his \\"defence of the Music Hall and the ballet as being worthy occupations and uplifting pastimes\\" was an \\"anathema\\" to the puritan and political climate. In the face of opposition, Headlam gave a lecture on \\"Theatres and Music-Halls\\" in which he expounded a positive Christian view of theatre and the theatrical profession. The speech inflamed Headlam's opponents and led to his bishop removing him from his curacy at St Matthew's. The Guild of St Matthew Inspired by Maurice's Christian socialism Headlam was determined to do all he could to reduce working class suffering. Disturbed by the appalling living conditions of his parishioners Headlam used his sermons to attack the wide gap between rich and poor. He presented Jesus Christ as a revolutionary and when John Jackson, the Bishop of London who had long been concerned about Headlam's teaching, heard about this, he threatened Headlam with dismissal. Headlam refused to change his views. In his efforts for the working class, in 1877, Headlam founded the Guild of St Matthew and led it to national prominence. Its original purpose was to increase attendance at early Eucharist. Headlam challenged workers to unite to strike down \\"the customs and circumstances\\" that make them \\"mere hands\\" for the production of goods. He not only issued verbal challenges, Headlam worked with the trade union movement, especially the Women's Trade Union League. However, Headlam had no specific proposals until he read Henry George's Progress and Poverty (D. Appleton & Co., 1879). From then on George replaced Maurice as the major influence in Headlam's thinking. 1878: Dismissal and marriage  Early in 1878, Headlam was dismissed from St Matthew's. His socialism was only one of Headlam's conflicts with authorities. The immediate cause of his dismissal was his \\"lecture in praise of the theatre and music halls.\\" In June, he received a testimonial of 100 guineas raised by supporters. Given the fact Headlam that \\"could never keep a job\\", it was fortunate that his father and grandfather were underwriters in Liverpool. From them, he inherited private means on which to live when unemployed. On 24 January 1878, Headlam married Beatrice Pennington at St. Augustine's Church, Queensgate. The marriage was dissolved in a very short time. He discovered his wife was a lesbian. Headlam was left with no prospect for employment, but in 1879 he was offered a curacy by John Rodgers, vicar of St Thomas's Charterhouse. =St Thomas's Charterhouse: 1878‚Äì1880= In 1878, Headlam became a curate at St Thomas's under the vicar, the Revd John Rodgers. Rodgers was \\"the most understanding incumbent\\" under whom Headlam would serve and even defended him in letters to Bishop Jackson. While at St Thomas's, Headlam continued his defence of theatre and ballet by forming the Church and Stage Guild. The death of Rodgers on 25 October 1879 ended Headlam's curacy at St Thomas's. Rodgers had served on the London School Board as Headlam was to do later.The Sunday Magazine for Family Reading. Vol. 9. London: Isbister and Company. 1880. p. 860. =St Michael's Shoreditch: 1880‚Äì1882= Headlam's curacy at St Michael's Shoreditch was brief because the parishioners strongly opposed his positions. From 1882 until its demise in 1903, Headlam sat on the London School Board. He took an active role in the promotion of evening classes for adults, especially as chairman of the Evening Continuation Schools Committee from 1897. =St George's Botolph: 1884= A trial curacy in 1884 ended when Headlam, at a rally, called for the abolition of the House of Lords. In 1884, Headlam used own money to buy and later to finance a newspaper, The Church Reformer: An Organ of Christian Socialism and Church Reform, that became virtually the voice of the Guild of Saint Matthew. The Church Reformer was published for eleven years. It supported land reform as advocated by Henry George. End of parish ministry After leaving St. George's Botolph in 1884, Headlam asked Bishop Jackson for a general licence to officiate in the diocese, but Jackson refused. Jackson's successor Frederick Temple also refused. Although his licence was eventually reinstated in 1898, he was never again to hold permanent office in the Church of England. After being \\"constantly dismissed\\" with no curacy, Headlam was reduced to holding services only when friendly clergy invited him. Beginning with his ordination, Headlam's \\"beliefs and actions\\" led to constant conflict with his ecclesiastical superiors and removal from curacies until he finally \\"abandoned of the idea of a parish ministry.\\" From then on, Headlam \\"devoted his time propagating Socialism\\" through his Guild of St. Matthew (until its demise in 1909) and membership in the Fabian Society and membership on the London County Council. Politics In 1873, after leaving St John's, Headlam received a curacy from Septimus Hansard, the rector of St Matthew's Church in Bethnal Green in London's East End, where poverty was the intrusive fact of social life. His response, in the form of a synthesis of ideas going back a generation to the Oxford Movement with socialist thinking, was startling although not entirely original. He attributed it in part to Charles Kingsley, but more especially to F. D. Maurice, whose incarnational theology he embraced while a student at Cambridge University. He added to the ideas of these early Christian Socialists a profound commitment to the creeds and to sacramental worship which he drew from the Anglo-Catholic ritualists whose work in the London slums he deeply admired. He was also a harsh critic of evangelicalism, condemning it as individualistic and otherworldly. He befriended working-class secularists and their leader, Charles Bradlaugh, even as he fought secularism itself. He also championed the arts in a broad sense, including the theatre, at a time when many clergy regarded it as morally suspect, and more scandalous still, the music hall, and ballerinas danced in flesh-coloured tights. Politically, from the time he left Cambridge, Headlam regarded himself as a socialist of sorts. While he was in Bethnal Green his politics took a more radical turn, and in the years that followed he joined his socialism to an enthusiastic support for Henry George's 'single tax', a policy that was gaining support in the Liberal Party. Yet because of his belief in individual liberty and his hostility to political sectarianism, he remained a member of the Liberal Party. He was elected to the London County Council as a Liberal Party‚Äìbacked Progressive candidate for Bethnal Green South West latterly in opposition to Labour candidates. These ideas formed a heady mixture and his preaching of it, in a form often directed frankly against 'the rich', kept open the quarrel with Bishop Jackson and would inspire yet another with Jackson's successor, Frederick Temple. Guild of St Matthew Headlam formed the Guild of St Matthew on 29 June 1877 (St Peter's Day). It began as a guild within St Matthew's Church, Bethnal Green, East London. However, in addition to parishioners, the Guild included other \\"London curates with radical views\\", so it soon grew to forty members. The Guild's initial purpose was increasing attendance at early Eucharist. Its stated objects were: (1) better observance of the \\"rules of worship\\" in the Book of Common Prayer, (2) removal of prejudices against the sacraments, and (3) promote \\"friendly intercourse, recreation and education\\" among its members. When Headlam was dismissed from St Matthew's in 1878, he took the Guild with him. No longer merely a parish guild, the Guild became organised on a national basis with local branches The Guild's aims widened to include \\"the promulgation of those elements in Christian social doctrine that would ameliorate the conditions of the poor through the creation of a just and equal society.\\" As a national organisation, the Guild linked Christian Socialists and Anglo-Catholics. This combination was incorporated in the Guild's three objectives: # \\"to get rid, by every possible means, of existing prejudices, especially on the part of 'secularists' against the Church, her sacraments and doctrines, and to endeavor to justify God to the people.\\" # \\"to promote frequent and reverend worship in the Holy Communion, and a better observance of the teaching of the Church of England as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer.\\" # \\"to promote the study of social and political questions in the light of the Incarnation.\\" The work of the Guild got off to a slow start as an extra-parochial society. However, by 1884 its work was in \\"full swing\\". The Guild published a list of 24 lecturers willing to speak on 130 subjects. At its annual meeting, the Guild adopted resolutions endorsing socialism and Henry George's \\"theory of Land Nationalization\\". Headlam and other Guild members put their words into action by working in the English Land Reclamation League. In 1884, Headlam used his own money to buy and edit a newspaper, The Church Reformer: An Organ of Christian Socialism and Church Reform, which became \\"virtually (though never officially) the mouthpiece of the Guild\\". The Church Reformer went bankrupt and published its last issue in December 1895. In the early 1890s, the Guild reached its peak membership of 364, of whom 99 were Anglican priests. Writing on behalf of the Guild, Headlam, in 1890, appealed that the \\"evils of poverty\\" be not \\"alleviated by Christian charity, but that they may be prevented by Christian justice.\\" Quoted in . In the Guild's doctrines, the goals of Christian justice included \\"(a) to restore to the people the value they gave to the land\\" where they worked, \\"(b) to bring about a better distribution of the wealth created by labour\\", and (c) \\"to give to the whole body of the people a voice in their own government\\", and (d) \\"to abolish false standard of worth and dignity\\". The Guild's 1892 annual report showed that the old battle against secularism ended with the death of Charles Bradlaugh in 1891. Most of the activity of the Guild was redirected toward \\"election campaigns\\". In the 1893 annual meeting, whether to characterise the Guild as \\"socialist\\" was discussed with a decision in the negative. As explained by Headlam, although the Guild was composed of \\"socialists who claim that socialism is Christian\\", to use the name officially would be \\"misleading and confusing both to friend and foe\\". In spite of Headlam's resistance to the term, scholars characterise the Guild of St Matthew as \\"socialist\\". Kenneth Leech says that the Guild was \\"the first explicitly socialist group in Britain\\" and Peter d'Alroy Jones describes the Guild as \\"the pioneer Christian socialist society of the revival period in Britain.\\" Before 1895, dissatisfied members usually withdrew and joined the larger Christian Social Union. In this year, increased dissatisfaction with Headlam as warden of the Guild resulted in a \\"large defection\\". In spite of dissatisfaction and defections in the membership, Headlam acted as warden of the Guild throughout its existence and his beliefs were reflected in its \\"proceedings and policies\\". He did not consult with others and acted as if the Guild should act according to his ideas. Headlam's arrogating control of the Guild constituted the primary reason for the dissatisfaction and defections. In 1909, the Guild of St Matthew ceased to exist. Norman describes the Guild as \\"a clerical, sacramentalist, Anglican and Socialist organization, existing largely for propagandistic purposes. Regardless of the immediate effects of its propaganda, the Guild molded \\"the radicalism of a number of Christian Socialists\\" who in the following decades played roles in the Anglican church's \\"social discourse. These people included Conrad Noel, Percy Dearmer, J. G. Adderley, P. E. T. Widdrington, F. L. Donaldson, C. W. Stubbs, Charles Marson, and Frank Weston.Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law, Issues 325‚Äì326 (Columbia University Press, 1930), 231.  'Church and Stage'  Headlam, in his lecture entitled Theatres and Music Halls and delivered on 7 October 1877 at the Commonwealth Club, Bethnal Green, said many religious people would think him wrong to speak of theatres and music halls except in condemnation; and even more would think him wrong to do so on a Sunday night. He recalled two women, members of his congregation in Drury Lane, who kept their profession as actresses a secret for many months, fearing that he, as a clergyman, would despise them. Conversely, he declared a deep respect for all those who \\"minister to our amusements\\" and said their work was as sacred as any other. In the introduction to the second edition of his published lecture he said, \\"I hold as an eternal truth that the Incarnation and Real Presence of Jesus Christ sanctifies all human things, not excluding human passion, mirth, and beauty.\\" He also believed good theatre could teach morality. \\"I defy anyone to see one of Shakespeare's great tragedies fairly well acted without having most tremendous moral lessons brought home to him,\\" Furthermore, he believed even unsophisticated entertainment could be beneficial and that theatregoing, in moderation, had \\"a brightening, educating effect\\". To \\"gloomy religious people\\" he said, \\"you do much more harm by a sweeping condemnation of a place than by a discriminating judgment. Recognise the good in any place or person, and then you have a right, and a power too, to go against the evil with some chance of success\\". More recently, he had come to see that even music halls had value. Managers were not to blame for the faults of their clientele, be they coarse or low, or loose women; the fault lay rather with \\"modern civilisation\\". He was, however, critical of the quality of music hall songs. John Jackson, Bishop of London, responding to a summary of the lecture in The Era, wrote to Headlam, \\"It is, of course, vain to argue with one who prefers so unhesitatingly his own judgment backed by the approval of actors and proprietors of Music Halls to that of his Incumbent and his Bishop, neither of whom can well be considered Puritan: but I do pray earnestly that you may not have lo meet before the Judgment Seat those whom your encouragement first led to places where they lost the blush of shame and took the first downward step towards vice and misery.\\" At St Thomas's on 30 May 1879, Headlam continued his defence of popular theatre, and especially the ballet, by forming the Church and Stage Guild. Within a year it had more than 470 members with at least 91 clergy and 172 professional theatre people. Its mission included breaking down \\"the prejudice against theatres, actors, music hall artists, stage singers, and dancers.\\" Fabian Society In December 1886, Headlam joined the Fabian Society and for several years served on the society's executive committee. In 1888, he and Annie Besant were elected to the London School Board as members of Progressive Party, a broad coalition of London liberals, radicals and socialists. In 1902 the Conservative government abolished school boards across England and transferred their responsibilities to the county councils. Although this was a reform designed in large part by his fellow Fabian, Sidney Webb, and endorsed by the Fabian Society, Headlam, like many others on the Left, denounced it as undemocratic. The new Education Act spared the London School Board, but only temporarily. It was also abolished in 1904. Despite his expectation that he would be able run as a Progressive candidate for the London County Council that year and be given a seat on the education committee, the Progressives did not nominate him, perhaps because of pressure from Webb and his allies. It was not until 1907 that he was elected to the council where he continued to be a tireless advocate for working-class children and their teachers. In the same year he published The Socialist's Church. He continued as a political figure for the rest of his life. Oscar Wilde's bailer On 3 April 1895 the first trial of Oscar Wilde began. This trial ended with a jury deadlocked on most of the charges. A second trial was scheduled in three weeks. During the interim, Wilde could be released if his bail requirements were met. Bail for the three weeks of freedom \\"on his own recognizance\\" between criminal trials was set at a total of ¬£5,000. Headlam, who did not know Wilde personally, put up half the ¬£5,000 bail required for Wilde's release. Headlam stated his motive as \\"concern for the arts and freedom\\". At his second trial, Wilde was found guilty, and sentenced to two years of hard labor. When Wilde was released after serving his sentence, Headlam was there to meet him at six o'clock in the morning on 19 May 1897. 'Homosexuals in Headlam's life' Headlam did not condone homosexuality. However, his willingness to help Wilde may have been connected with the fact that \\"others close to him had been caught in similar sexual tangles\\". Headlam's own short-lived marriage in 1878 had been to a lesbian, Beatrice Pennington. Headlam's close relations with other homosexuals included his Eton master William Johnson and his friend C. J. Vaughan. Post-curacy years Beginning with his ordination as a deacon in 1869, Headlam was repeatedly in conflict with his ecclesiastical superiors that led to removal from curacies until he finally \\"abandoned of the idea of a parish ministry\\" in 1884. However, he continued to be active in social reform until shortly before his death in 1924. Central to Headlam's activity was his work within the voluntary organisations of his Guild of St Matthew (until its demise in 1909) and the Fabian Society. Church Headlam addressed the 3rd Lambeth Conference in 1888 arguing that Christian socialism is biblical, but the bishops gave him \\"little heed\\". In January 1898, Headlam was granted a general licence to preach by the new Bishop of London, Mandell Creighton. From then until his dying days, Headlam celebrated Mass every Sunday at All Souls Church in Haliburton Road. Education Headlam became increasingly involved with \\"educational reform\\". Education was one of the two top priorities for Headlam in post-curacy years. He had long viewed education as essential for social transformation, So in 1882, he was elected to the London School Board, an activity that he continued the rest of his life. The London School Board was absorbed into the London County Council in 1903, so Headlam ran for and was elected to the London County Council for the Progressive Party in 1907 as a way of continuing his work in educational reform. He sat on the council until his death. Land Question The \\"Land Question\\" was the other issue that occupied Headlam in his mature years. The Land Question was about \\"the use and ownership of land\\" and \\"landlordism\\" and many remedies were proposed. Lectures offered by the Guild of St Matthew emphasised \\"the land question as fundamental\\" for Christian socialists. After reading Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1886), Headlam asserted that \\"Land Nationalization is a necessary corollary of Christian Socialism.\\" In 1906, Headlam began the Anti-Puritan League, but it gained only few members. In 1907, Headlam published The Socialist's Church. Vindication After years of conflict with and dismissals by his ecclesiastical superiors, Headlam was vindicated at the end of his life. In October 1924, during his terminal illness, Headlam received a letter from Randall Davidson the Archbishop of Canterbury. My dear Headlam, I hear a report that you are unwell. I hope that it is not serious and work can go on, for I fear that your absence in some circles, educational and other, would be bad for 'affairs' in the country. You, at least, whatever be said about the rest of us, have been consistent in your devotion to the cause or causes for which you care. God keep and bless you. Most truly yours, Randall Cantaur Headlam immediately replied with a \\"heartfelt letter of thanks\\". He later commented, \\"Now I feel I can say that I have won.\\" Death Within a month, more heart attacks led to Headlam's death at his home, \\"Wavertree\\", Peter's Road, St Margaret's-on-Thames, Middlesex, on 18 November 1924. His funeral was held at All Souls in St Margarets and he was buried at East Sheen Cemetery on 24 November. Retrospection \\"Despite Headlam's energy, his rebellious character and his unusual combination of socialism with Christian sacramentalism deprived him of much permanent influence either in the church or in the political world. His practical achievements were limited. He was a prophetic figure, whose passion for social justice was to inspire the small group of Anglican clergy exploring the political application of Christian social concern in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\\" Works * The Church Catechism and the Emancipation of Labour (London: 1875) * Theatres & Music Halls: a Lecture Given at the Commonwealth Club, Bethnal Green, on Sunday, October 7, 1877 (Westminster: Women's Printing Society, 2nd Ed; rprt Forgotten Books, 2015) * Priestcraft and Progress: Being Sermons and Lectures (London: Hodges, 1878) * The Service of Humanity and Other Sermons (London: J.

The editors' other activities, such as organizing Homocore shows where bands such as Fugazi and Beat Happening appeared, and writing for and creating other publications, were instrumental in popularizing the Queercore movement, particularly on the west coast. (Deke also performed in films, such as The Yo-Yo Gang, and had his own Queercore band Comrade in Arms.) Internationally, Homocore zine, throughout its eight (including the rarely seen issue #5-1/2) issues, along with J.D.s, was influential in the rise of Queercore as the zines found their way into the hands of queer punk kids across North America, South America and Europe. Personal life Jennings currently resides in Los Angeles, California, with his partner Josh Stehlik. He is faculty at Calarts Art+Technology program, and also works as a technician at the University of California, Irvine's Arts Computation Engineering graduate program.

History Cusk was launched 28 July 1945 by Electric Boat, Groton, Conn.; cosponsored by Mrs. C. S. Gillette, and Mrs. W. G. Reed; and commissioned 5 February 1946, Commander Paul E. Summers in command. Christening of USS Cusk, with Walter Reed.jpgChristening of USS Cusk, with Mr. & Mrs. Walter Reed, Mr. L. Spear, Mr. & Mrs. Claude Gillette Departing New London 24 April 1946, Cusk made an extended cruise through the Caribbean Sea, and arrived at San Diego 6 June 1946. She sailed to Alaska and northern waters between 16 July and 20 August, then carried out local operations out of San Diego. A pioneer in the missile field, Cusk was fitted with a missile hangar and launching ramp just aft of her sail in 1947. She was designated SSG-348, 20 January 1948 and was the first submarine to launch a guided missile (a Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, derived from the German V-1 flying bomb) from her own deck, a forerunner of the cruise missile and ballistic missile submarines of the future. She entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a \\"Fleet Snorkel\\" conversion and modernization in 1954, but remained in the Regulus missile program because of her special guidance equipment, although redesignated SS-348 on 1 July 1954. Cusk arrived at Pearl Harbor, her new home port, 13 May 1957. Continuing her missile guidance duties with consorts , and she operated in Hawaiian waters with a cruise to San Diego in 1957 and duty in the Far East in 1958 and 1960. In the fall of 1961 Cusk had her Regulus missile guidance equipment removed and reverted to attack submarine profile. After successfully shooting a MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedo at the target cliffs on Kahoolawe Island she departed for WesPac in January 1962. Designated as the SubFlot 7 Mining platform during the deployment, Cusk offloaded all steam torpedoes at Cubi Point NAS that spring and reloaded 4 MK 27 Mobile drill mines and 18 MK 10 moored drill mines. 12 days after departure from Subic Bay, Cusk entered the shallow waters of Buckner Bay Okinawa submerged, launched the 4 MK 27 mobile mines and then planted a field of 18 MK 10 moored mines. following the successful mine plant Cusk returned to Subic Bay RP, and retrieved her MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedoes. In June 1969, the Secretary of Defense ordered that 100 of the Navy's oldest ships be decommissioned; the Cusk was on that list. Subsequently, the Cusk was redesignated AGSS-348 and she set sail for the last time in September 1969 for Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco. Cusk was decommissioned and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register, 24 September 1969; she was sold for scrap, 26 June 1972.

A brilliant is a diamond or other gemstone cut in a particular form with numerous facets so as to have exceptional brilliance. The shape resembles that of a cone and provides maximized light return through the top of the diamond. Even with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. The round brilliant cut is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly shaped crystals such as macles are more likely to be cut in a fancy cut--that is, a cut other than the round brilliant--which the particular crystal shape lends itself to. Facet proportions and names Diamond proportions and facets, for the round brilliant cut. The original round brilliant-cut was developed by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919. The modern round brilliant consists of 58 facets (or 57 if the culet is excluded), ordinarily today cut in two pyramids placed base to base: 33 on the crown (the top half above the middle or girdle of the stone), truncated comparatively near its base by the table, and 25 on the pavilion (the lower half below the girdle), which has only the apex cut off to form the culet, around which 8 extra facets are sometimes added. In recent decades, most girdles are faceted. Many girdles have 32, 64, 80, or 96 facets; these facets are not counted in the total. While the facet count is standard, the actual proportions (crown height and angle, pavilion depth, etc.) are not universally agreed upon. Some gem cutters refer to an American brilliant cut or a Scandinavian brilliant cut. Quoting Green et al. 2001: Figures 1 and 2 show the facets of a round brilliant diamond. Figure 1 assumes that the \\"thick part of the girdle\\" is the same thickness at all 16 \\"thick parts\\". It does not consider the effects of indexed upper girdle facets. Figure 2 is adapted from Figure 37 of Marcel Tolkowsky's Diamond Design, which was originally published in 1919. Since 1919, the lower girdle facets have become longer. As a result, the pavilion main facets have become narrower. Cut grading The relationship between the crown angle and the pavilion angle has the greatest effect on the look of the diamond. A slightly steep pavilion angle can sometimes be complemented by a shallower crown angle, and vice versa. Other proportions also affect the look of the diamond: * The table ratio is highly significant. * The length of the lower girdle facets affects whether Hearts and arrows can be seen in the stone, under certain viewers. ** Most round brilliant diamonds have roughly the same girdle thickness at all 16 \\"thick parts\\". ** So-called \\"cheated\\" girdles have thicker girdles where the main facets touch the girdle than where adjacent upper girdle facets touch the girdle. These stones weigh more (for a given diameter, average girdle thickness, crown angle, pavilion angle, and table ratio), and have worse optical performance (their upper girdle facets appear dark in some lighting conditions). ** So-called \\"painted\\" girdles have thinner girdles where the main facets touch the girdle than where adjacent upper girdle facets touch the girdle. These stones (such as EightStar-brand diamonds) have less light leakage at the edge of the stone (for a given crown angle, pavilion angle, and table ratio). Some diamonds with painted girdles receive lower grades in the GIA's cut grading system, for reasons given in a 2005 GIA article. Several groups have developed diamond cut grading standards. They all disagree somewhat on which proportions make the best cut. There are certain proportions that are considered best by two or more groups however. * The AGA standards may be the strictest. David Atlas (who developed the AGA standards) has suggested that they are overly strict. * The HCA (Holloway Cut Adviser) changed several times between 2001 and 2004. , an HCA score below two represented an excellent cut. The HCA distinguishes between brilliant, Tolkowsky, and fiery cuts. * The American Gem Society (AGS) standards changed in 2005 to better match Tolkowsky's model and Octonus' ray tracing results. The 2005 AGS standards penalize stones with \\"cheated\\" girdles. They grade from 0 to 10. *The GIA began grading cut on every grading report beginning 2006 based on their comprehensive study of 20,000 proportions with 70,000 observations of 2,000 diamonds. The single descriptive words are as follows: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor. The distance from the viewer's eye to the diamond is important. The 2005 AGS cut standards are based on a distance of 25 centimeters (about 10 inches). The 2004 HCA cut standards are based on a distance of 40 centimeters (about 16 inches). Polish and symmetry are two important aspects of the cut. The polish grade describes the smoothness of the diamond's facets, and the symmetry grade refers to alignment of the facets. With poor polish, the surface of a facet can be dulled, and may create blurred or dulled sparkle. It may constantly look like it needs to be cleaned. With poor symmetry, light can be misdirected as it enters and exits the diamond. Hearts and arrows phenomenon A diamond that has the top facet or \\"table facet\\" exactly perpendicular to the bottom of the diamond or \\"pavilion\\" and has its other facets precisely aligned with excellent symmetry, may show patterns that look like arrows from the top and hearts from the bottom. Generally it will need to be viewed loose under a gemscope to see the pattern very well. Although the hearts and arrows property is indicative of a top-tier cut, it does not always mean the diamond will be the most brilliant. Optimal facet placement is the key to brilliance and more important than facet patterning. Not all ideal round cuts will have the hearts and arrows effect either.

Marrickville is located south-west of the Sydney central business district and is the largest suburb in the Inner West Council local government area. Marrickville sits on the northern bank of the Cooks River, opposite Earlwood and shares borders with Stanmore, Enmore, Newtown, St Peters, Sydenham, Tempe, Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park and Petersham. The southern part of the suburb, near the river, is known as Marrickville South and includes the historical locality called The Warren. Marrickville is a culturally diverse suburb consisting of both low and high density residential, commercial and light industrial areas. The area's original name is Bulanaming and the traditional owners of the land are the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. History The name Marrickville comes from the 24.3 ha (60 acres) 'Marrick' estate of Thomas Chalder, which was subdivided on 24 February 1855. He named it after his native village Marrick, North Yorkshire, England. The estate centred on the intersection of Victoria Road and Chapel Street. William Dean, the publican of the Marrick Hotel, in Illawarra Road (now the site of the Henson Park Hotel) is credited with adding the \\"ville\\" to Marrick when it was gazetted in 1861. The first land grant in the area was to William Beckwith in 1794. Thomas Moore received in 1799 and another in 1803. Dr Robert Wardell purchased most of this land for his estate that stretched from Petersham to the Cooks River. His estate was broken up after he was murdered by escaped convicts in September 1834. Old Police Station, Gladstone Street Thomas Holt (1811‚Äì1888) was a Sydney business tycoon who built a castellated Victorian Gothic mansion named ‚ÄòThe Warren‚Äô in 1857 in Marrickville South. It was designed by architect George Mansfield, and contained an impressive art gallery filled with paintings and sculptures from Europe. It had elaborate stables built into imposing stone walls, and large landscaped gardens filled with urns overlooking the Cooks River. Holt gave it that name because he bred rabbits on the estate for hunting, as well as the grounds being stocked with alpacas and other exotics. The Warren was a landmark in the district for some decades; the still-operating Warren View Hotel in Enmore as evidence of this. Renovations were undertaken in 1866. There were also bathing sheds and a Turkish Bath built on the river. The property was south of Wardell‚Äôs and covered the area from today‚Äôs Unwins Bridge Road to Illawarra Road and Warren Road. Thomas Holt was a large land holder in Sydney with another mansion at the edge of Gwawley Bay, Sylvania Waters, New South Wales in 1881,(his last and greatest residence, the monumental forty room Sutherland House mansion which was destroyed by fire in 1918) and vast property holdings from Sutherland to Cronulla. As Holt's health began to be an issue, the Warren was subdivided in 1884 with the land around the immediate building's grounds being sold off - and the family returning to Britain for the remaining years of his life. He died in 1888. The estate stables were demolished some time between 1884 and 1886, with the nearby Ferncourt Public School being originally built as a house \\"Prosna\\" by Polish born artist, Gracius Joseph Broinowski, from sandstone blocks of the stable, and a cedar staircase and marble mantelpiece purchased from Holt's estate installed in it. It is obvious today the last block remaining where the mansion stood as it is indicated by the newer houses of the 1920s-1930s as well as, obviously the name of the road, driven down the western side of the block - \\"Mansion Street\\" - and \\"Holt St\\" adjacent to it forming the lower side of the square perimeter). The Warren became a nunnery when the mansion and of land were purchased by a French order of Carmelite nuns. The Carmelites were evicted from The Warren in 1903 for outstanding debts. By this stage the grounds appear to be bare with a high wood fence installed on the western side of the building about this time. It then was used during WWI for an artillery training range and this fenced area also appears in photos along with smaller buildings on the grounds nearby. It was resumed in 1919 by the New South Wales government was finally demolished in around 1922 - the land subdivided to build a housing estate for returned soldiers. Sir John Sulman was engaged to build this. Not much remains of the once imposing castle-like building except for two stone turrets from the building indicating what was once on the general spot (this was recently vandalised and the commemorative plaque stolen; noted 2010. Originally piers from the back entrance of the building, which had been stored by the council for many years - they were placed on the headland with a memorial fountain in 1967 at Richardson's Lookout in Holt Street. Other remains are garden paths with flags and liners, one or two of the original stone blocks from the walls, and the base of what was probably a garden feature such as an urn or fountain. An area with a few cobblestones in the grass, remains under some native fig trees, and was probably a drive that led to the back of the stables. Also on the bank of the river below are the crypts that Thomas Holt built into a sandstone overhang for his family. No bodies were subsequently laid to rest except for the Mother Superior of the Carmelite order who was interred for a short time. \\"Ferndale\\" in Kent Lane, Newtown, is the earliest of his four houses and the last surviving residence connected with Thomas Holt. It is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register Marrickville became a municipality on 6 November 1861. In 1948, it merged with neighbouring municipalities of St Peters and Petersham to form Marrickville Municipal Council. The first school opened in August 1864 and the post office opened in 1865. The railway line to Bankstown opened in 1895. The station was known as Illawarra Road during construction. Later, when it was decided that Marrickville was a more appropriate name, the original Marrickville station was renamed Sydenham.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 165 View of the Marrickville Post Office from Marrickville Road. The modern post office can be seen to the rear of the building. The front of the building now houses a cafe. =Mid-2000s: gentrification= There has been a gradual change in Marrickville, with some media reports calling it \\"the new Paddington\\". There has been an influx of young professionals, as well as artists and musicians. A bohemian vibe has been cultivated and some say Marrickville is \\"the new Newtown\\", not Paddington. Marrickville has been referred to as the number one emerging \\"Sydney hipster suburbs of 2017\\", due to its youthful population, increasing numbers of liquor licences and numerous \\"foodie\\" eateries.https://www.finder.com.au/top-nsw-hipster-suburbs-to-emerge Heritage listings Marrickville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Bankstown railway: Marrickville railway station * Carrington Road: Sewage Pumping Station 271 * Garden Street: Sydenham Pit and Drainage Pumping Station 1 * 96-106 Illawarra Road: Marrickville Town Hall * 274A Marrickville Road: Marrickville Post Office * 24, 26 Premier Street: Premier Street Sewer Vent and Cottages * Thornley Street: Cooks River Sewage Aqueduct Marrickville South Marrickville South is a locality in the southern part of the suburb at .

Outside Marrickville Town Hall is a World War I war memorial, featuring a Winged Victory figure. Standing at over tall, the figure is the largest known bronze casting on a memorial in Australia. =Marrickville Library= Marrickville Library (which is part of the Inner West Library Service) formerly adjoined the town hall. The library offers services which reflect the diversity of the community; among these are young readers groups and material available in Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and Vietnamese. Plans to build a new library have been announced by Marrickville Council and the major architectural project was scheduled to be completed in 2015. Due to the amalgamation to Inner West Council, the new library project was suspended for some time. In March 2018, it was announced that plans for the library had been lodged and approved and that the new library was being built. The new library was opened in August on the premises of the former Marrickville Hospital. The browsable collection was expanded to 85,000 books, in part thanks to the opening of the previously-warehoused art history stack. The heritage-listed former hospital buildings were restored, while additional buildings were designed by BVN Architecture. To coincide with the opening, the site was renamed Patyegarang Place, named after the first Aboriginal person to teach their language to a settler. Her story is often associated with learning and culture. =Houses= Many Marrickville homes are detached or terraced Victorian houses built in the late 19th century. Many others were built in the Federation style in the early 20th century. Whilst many of the larger estates have been subdivided, some still remain, including the heritage-listed Victorian Italianate manor Stead House, former residence of Samuel Cook, General Manager of The Sydney Morning Herald in the late 19th century. It was used as a Salvation Army hostel for some time, but was turned into apartments in 2011. Politics The Marrickville Council made headlines in Australia with its controversial boycott of Israeli goods in 2011. The former electorate of Marrickville also made headlines in the 2011 State election as a marginal seat that was possibly going to be won by the Greens. However, the seat was won by the Australian Labor Party.

Design The arrow shaft is made from wood. A slit is cut at one end to take a pair of card flights, and the other end is given a point. An all-important notch or shallow groove is cut into or around the shaft, just below the flights. After the flights are inserted, the open end of the slit is closed with string or a rubber band to prevent the flights from falling out. Use To launch the arrow, the thrower uses a length of string that is longer than the length of the arrow itself. A knot is tied in one end of the string, and this is placed into the notch or groove in the arrow shaft. The rest of the string is then passed around the shaft once, and is made to align over and above the knot before being stretched down to the point end of the arrow. The string is tightened, ensuring that the knotted end stays within the notch, and the surplus is wound around the thrower's throwing hand. The throwing hand with the string wound around it should be near the point end of the arrow, with the thrower able to easily grip the end. The arrow is then held behind the thrower, with the string taut. The throwing arm should be as fully extended as possible, enabling the arrow to be thrown like a javelin, but held much closer to the tip. Following through with the throwing hand allows the string to provide additional forward force on the arrow, extending the length and reach of the thrower's arm, in a fashion similar to a sling. A distance of easily about 50 m can be achieved.

He often painted scenes of places he had visited, using a variety of mediums, including oils, watercolors, and charcoal. Beck was born in Dallas, Texas, and attended Lincoln High School, where he received his only formal art training. Afterwards, he worked for the United States Postal Service, as well as various other jobs before becoming a professional artist. He is possibly known best for his works from the 1960s dealing with the Civil Rights Movement, although Beck commonly featured other subjects, including children, religion, and human interaction, particularly in the African-American community in the southern regions of the United States. A longtime resident of Oak Cliff, Beck was a firm believer in grassroots movements, and established the Arthello Beck Gallery, which became a centerpiece of the Dallas area art scene in the 1970s and 80s, and was instrumental to the careers of many black artists. Beck was a member of the National Conference of Artists and the Southwest Alliance of African American Artists, and was one of the founders of the Southwest Black Artists Guild.Text of House Resolution 1760 honoring Arthello Beck, Jr., Texas House of Representatives, May 24, 2005 Honors His paintings and sketches were among those selected for inclusion in a touring exhibition of athlete Grant Hill's collection of African-American artists.

Although a petition was signed by over 850 residents, the City Council voted unanimously to reject the proposal, choosing instead to give his name to a gallery within the center. The decision met with controversy on both sides, as proponents felt that a gallery within the building was not a sufficiently prominent honor, while others argued that the center's current name brings honor to a section of town that is often maligned and that a majority of the petition's signers lived outside the South Dallas area.Scott Goldstein. \\"South Dallas Cultural Center to keep name, council confirms: Late Dallas painter will be honored with gallery,\\" The Dallas Morning News, June 13, 2007 Painters in Dallas Dallaspaints Notes External links * Art Galore!

In Britain, the post of locomotive superintendent was introduced in the late 1830s, and chief mechanical engineer in 1886. Emerging professional roles In the early Victorian era, projected canal or railway schemes were prepared by groups of promoters who hired specialists such as civil engineers, surveyors, architects or contractors to survey a route; and this resulted in the issue of a prospectus setting out their proposals. Provided that adequate capital could be raised from potential investors, agreements obtained from the landowners along the proposed route and, in Britain, an Act of Parliament obtained (different terminology is used in other countries), then construction might begin either by a new company specially formed to build and run it or by an existing company. Design, construction and day-to-day operation of the canal or railway was managed by men who might otherwise work for the promoters. Some of the pioneer railway builders were self-taught, but others had gained their engineering experience constructing canals, or in military service. In Britain, the Institution of Civil Engineers had been founded in London in 1818, with Thomas Telford as its first president and its formation pre-dated many of the railway schemes. It obtained a Royal Charter in 1828. Later, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was formed in 1847, with George Stephenson as its first president. The Corps of Royal Engineers, a British military organisation, was older than both of these civilian engineering institutions and it had extensive experience of (military) railway operations. For this reason, for almost 150 years from its foundation by the Board of Trade in 1840, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate recruited suitably qualified retired officers from the Corps into its \\"senior\\" arm, as railway inspecting officers. These officers retained their former military rank within the Inspectorate. It was to be 1985 before a railway inspecting officer without a previous military career was appointed: the officer transferred across from the \\"junior\\" arm: as a former railway employment inspector. Over the same period, of almost a century and a half, the Inspectorate was headed by a retired officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers as its chief inspecting officer. Other, former army officers, such as Charles Blacker Vignoles, were to gain new careers on the railways when they became under-employed after the Napoleonic War. In Britain, the various railway companies appointed and employed an engineer or chief engineer, who was usually a civil engineer by profession. This was a permanent management role in the company in contrast to that of contractors, for instance, who were only hired to perform specific tasks such as construction of the line. The chief engineer had his own department (and budget) and was an important company official. The chief engineer was responsible for all engineering functions: civil, which included bridges, viaducts, tunnels and track; and, later, mechanical, which included rolling stock. In some early railways, such as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;), which opened in 1830, there was indecision on whether to use fixed engines and ropes or moving locomotives. Cases had arisen of locomotives being too heavy and breaking the cast iron rails that they had to run on; and locomotive wheels breaking and/or falling off. Finally, the L&MR;'s board agreed the use of moving locomotives; and the rolling stock was selected from various specialist builders by competition, at the Rainhill Trials. Soon afterwards, many railway companies were to set up their own railway workshops, although railway companies continued to buy-in locomotives from specialist manufacturers, such as Robert Stephenson and Company which was founded by George and Robert Stephenson in 1828. Some railway companies operated their own ferries, boats, and ships and these would also be the responsibility of their Chief Engineer, but they would have been ordered from shipyards. Isambard Kingdom Brunel set an example, designing three great steamships: the SS Great Western, the SS Great Britain and the SS Great Eastern ‚Äì the first two being built at Bristol shipyards and the third at Millwall, London. The Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland was formed in 1857 as a professional body for these trades in Scotland. The specialism of mechanical engineering became established on the railways, with an emphasis on moving parts; and, in terms of importance, this was concerned with designing and building of reliable locomotives, carriages and waggons. Private companies designed and built these items to order and could offer standard designs to railway companies as well as \\"specials\\" to meet specific customer's requirements; otherwise railway companies could and did establish workshops to build their own locomotives and carriages. In August 1837, for example, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Engineer responsible for the Great Western Railway, appointed Daniel Gooch locomotive superintendent to the company; and it was his responsibility to provide the locomotives, the accommodation for them and the running and the repair shops. Gooch suggested a green field site, New Swindon, and this was to lead to the building of a railway works, a railway village and eventually the town of Swindon. Swindon was not the only example of railway town or community that was created in England: Crewe being another. Locomotive superintendent Initially, when a railway company chose to build its own rolling stock in house, the mechanical engineering aspect was regarded as a subsidiary function to that of the chief engineer and this was reflected in various job titles, such as chief of locomotive department, locomotive foreman and locomotive superintendent. Later, there was a desire to improve the prestige, and salary, of the locomotive superintendent and a means of achieving those aims was to seek to regrade the post as chief mechanical engineer (CME). John Aspinall of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was the first CME to be appointed to that post in 1886. A further six British railway companies created the post of CME between 1902 and 1914. Functions The chief mechanical engineer was responsible for all aspects of locomotives and that included their design, testing and modification of existing designs. The early mechanical engineer was concerned with mechanical moving parts and for many years this responsibility also included railway signalling, particularly points and semaphore signals, as these were entirely mechanically operated. With the introduction of low-power electricity to the railways, various new systems such as telegraphs, telephones and electrical signalling systems were introduced; and responsibilities of these systems were transferred to the signal and telegraph (S&T;) department.

Alpha Persei has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, and is a circumpolar star when viewed from mid-northern latitudes. Alpha Persei lies in the midst of a cluster of stars named as the eponymous Alpha Persei Cluster, or Melotte 20, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. Determined distance using the trigonometric parallax, places the star from the Sun.  Nomenclature  Œ± Persei is the star's Bayer designation. The star also bore the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, which are Arabic in origin. The former, meaning 'Elbow' and also written Mirphak, Marfak or Mirzac, comes from the Arabic Mirfaq al-Thurayya, while Algenib, also spelt Algeneb, Elgenab, Gƒônib, Chenib or Alchemb, is derived from ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿ® al-janb, or ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿ® al-jƒÅnib, 'the flank' or 'side'. and was also the traditional name for Gamma Pegasi.Pegasus In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Mirfak for this star (Gamma Pegasi was given the name Algenib). Hinalii is the name of the star in Native Hawaiian astronomy. The name of the star is meant to commemorate a great tsunami and mark the beginning of the migration of Maui.

The spectrum of Alpha Persei matches a stellar classification of F5 Ib, revealing it to be a supergiant star in the latter stages of its evolution. It has a similar spectrum to Procyon A, though the latter star is much less luminous. This difference is highlighted in their spectral designation under the Yerkes spectral classification, published in 1943, where stars are ranked on luminosity as well as spectral typing. Procyon A is thus F5 IV, a subgiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of Alpha Persei has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Alpha Persei has about 8.5 times the Sun's mass and has expanded to roughly 60 times the size of the Sun. It is radiating 5,000 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,350 K, which creates the yellow- white glow of an F-type star. In the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, Alpha Persei lies inside the region in which Cepheid variables are found. It is thus useful in the study of these stars, which are important standard candles.  Unconfirmed exoplanet  In 2010 evidence was presented of a planet orbiting Mirfak. Radial velocity data from repeated observations of the star found a periodic variation with an amplitude of 70.8 ¬± 1.6 m/s. The proposed planet is estimated to have a minimum mass of approximately 6.6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 128 days, but the claimed period may not be stable over 20 years so the exoplanet is considered doubtful. Rotational modulation due to surface activity such as starspots seem a more likely explanation of the radial velocity variations. In previous publications, periodic radial velocity variations of 87.7 or 77.7 days have been reported but, these have not been confirmed.

It is normally worn as part of Scottish military or civilian Highland dress, either formal or informal, as an alternative to the Balmoral bonnet or tam o' shanter. History Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry in 1812. Traditionally, the Glengarry bonnet is said to have first appeared as the head dress of the Glengarry Fencibles when they were formed in 1794 by Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. MacDonell, therefore, is sometimes said to have invented the glengarry ‚Äì but it is not clear whether early pictures of civilians or fencible infantry show a true glengarry, capable of being folded flat, or the standard military bonnet of the period merely 'cocked' into a more 'fore-and-aft' shape.The King's Jaunt, John Prebble, Birlinn Limited, Edinburgh 2000, , states that MacDonell invented the cap. However, This claims that the idea came from Balmoral bonnet wearers who bent and creased their bonnets and then was popularised by MacDonell. In the late 18th century, however, the term Balmoral bonnet had yet to be coined. The first use of the classic, military glengarry may not have been until 1841, when it is said to have been introduced for the pipers of the 79th Foot by the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Lauderdale Maule. It was only in the 1850s that the glengarry became characteristic undress headgear of the Scottish regiments of the British Army. By 1860, the glengarry without a diced border and usually with a feather had been adopted by pipers in all regiments except the 42nd (Black Watch), whose pipers wore the full dress feather bonnet. In 1914, all Scottish infantry regiments were wearing dark blue glengarries in non-ceremonial orders of dress, except for the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) who wore them in rifle green, and the Scots Guards, who wore peaked forage caps or khaki service dress caps. The diced bands on glengarries were either in red, white and blue for royal regiments or red, white and green for others. The toories on top could be red, royal blue or black, according to regiment. The Black Watch and Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, however, wore glengarries without dicing and The 93rd (Sutherland)Highlanders were unique in wearing a simple red and white chequer pattern. This was said to commemorate the stand of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders at the Battle of Balaclava immortalized as The Thin Red Line. Between 1868 and 1897, the glengarry was also worn as an undress cap for most British soldiers until replaced by the short-lived Field Service Cap. When this was revived in 1937, the Dress Regulations for the Army, described the Universal Pattern Field Service Cap (used by the British Army in World War II) as \\"similar in shape to the Glengarry.\\" Modern wear Glengarry worn on parade (Royal Regiment of Scotland, 2011). The glengarry continued to be worn in dark blue by all regiments of the Scottish Division up to their final amalgamation into the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006. In parade dress, it was worn by all regiments except the Black Watch, who wore the blue balmoral bonnet, and musicians of some regiments, who wore feather bonnets in full dress. The Black Watch, however, wore a plain blue glengarry in some orders of dress with trews. The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) wore a plain rifle green glengarry up until their disbandment in 1968. The blue glengarry currently worn by the Royal Regiment of Scotland has red, blue and white dicing, a red toorie, black silk cockade and the regimental cap badge surmounted by a blackcock (Tetrao tetrix) feather. This last is a tradition taken from the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers. Other Commonwealth military forces that have Scottish and Highland regiments also make use of the glengarry. =Irish Army= The headdress worn by Irish Army's Cavalry Corps is called a Glengarry but is more similar to the caubeen in appearance, than to the Scottish headdress of the same name. It was designed in 1934 for the Cavalry Corps as a more practical headdress than the standard peaked cap in the confines of their armoured cars and tanks. The Glengarry is the same colour as the army's service dress uniform with a black band and two black swallow-tail ribbons at the rear. The cap badge is worn over the left eye. Officers in the RDF wear a similar Glengarry but with green band and ribbons as part of their service dress uniform. Army pipers and drummers wear a black Glengarry with a saffron band and ribbons and a dark green feather hackle. Civilian wear The glengarry is worn by male members of staff at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the Queen's Official residence in Scotland. The glengarry is also commonly worn by civilians, notably civilian pipe bands, but can be considered an appropriate hat worn by any man with Highland casual dress or day wear. In this context, it most often has a red toorie. In pipe bands, women often also wear the glengarry. The Glengarry is the headress stipulated in Dress Regulations for Officers of the Boys' Brigade; namely Warrant Officers, Lieutenants and Brevet Captains. Police use of diced band In 1932 Percy Sillitoe, the Chief Constable of the City of Glasgow Police, abolished the traditional custodian helmet and added a new feature to the peaked caps worn by his police officers. This new feature was a black and white chequered cap band based on the dicings seen on the glengarry headress of the Scottish regiments. The diced band, popularly known as the Sillitoe Tartan, later spread to police forces in Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of the United Kingdom, as well as to some other parts of the world, notably Chicago. Method of wearing The correct method of wearing the glengarry has changed since the end of the Second World War. Prior to 1945, glengarries were generally worn steeply angled, with the right side of the cap worn low, often touching the ear, and the side with the capbadge higher on the head. The trend since the end of the war has been to wear the glengarry level on the head, with the point directly over the right eye.

It was designed by Henry Ivatt in 1897 Henry Alfred Ivatt (16 September 1851, Wentworth, Cambridgeshire ‚Äì 25 October 1923) was an English railway engineer, and was the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Great Northern Railway from 1896 to 1911.  Career  =London and North Western Railway= Educated at Liverpool College., at age 17, Ivatt was apprenticed to John Ramsbottom at the Crewe Works of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). He worked as a fireman for six months and held various positions there. He was made head of the Holyhead Locomotive Depot in 1874, before being promoted to the head of the Chester District. =Great Southern and Western Railway= In 1877, Ivatt moved to Ireland, and the Great Southern and Western Railway at Inchicore. In 1882, he was appointed to the post of locomotive engineer there, where he patented a design for a sprung flap for vertically-opening carriage windows that became ubiquitous. =Great Northern Railway= In 1895, Ivatt returned to England and was appointed Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), succeeding Patrick Stirling, with references from Samuel Waite Johnson, John Aspinall, Francis William Webb and William Dean. =Locomotive designs= At the GNR, he became associated with the 4-4-2 (Atlantic) type, which he introduced to Britain. Ivatt was also the first to introduce Walschaerts valve gear to Britain. Ivatt retired on 2 December 1911. He was succeeded as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the GNR by Nigel Gresley. Family He had six children, the first of whom, Campbell, died as a child in 1898. His son George Ivatt was also a locomotive engineer and post-war CME of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.

Baby\\". Career Channel performed originally for the radio program Louisiana Hayride and then joined with the harmonica player Delbert McClinton, singing country music. Channel wrote \\"Hey! Baby\\" with Margaret Cobb in 1959 and performed the song for two years before recording it for Fort Worth record producer Bill Smith. It was issued originally on Smith's LeCam label, but as it started to sell well, it was acquired for distribution by Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury. The song went to number one in the US in March 1962 and held that position for three weeks. Besides topping the U.S. popular music charts, it also became number two in the United Kingdom. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Channel had four more singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including \\"Number One Man\\" (which peaked at number 52), \\"Come On Baby\\" (number 98), \\"Going Back to Louisiana\\" (number 89), and \\"Mr. Bus Driver\\" (number 90), but none of them was as successful as \\"Hey! Baby\\", and he is considered a one-hit wonder. Channel toured Europe and was assisted at one gig by the Beatles, who were then little known. John Lennon, who had \\"Hey! Baby\\" on his jukebox, was fascinated by McClinton's harmonica. A popular legend is that Lennon was taught to play harmonica by McClinton, but by that time Lennon had already been playing the instrument live for some time. The harmonica segment in \\"Hey! Baby\\" inspired Lennon's playing on the Beatles' first single, 1962's \\"Love Me Do\\", as well as later Beatles records, and the harmonica break on Frank Ifield's \\"I Remember You.\\" The main appeal of \\"Hey! Baby\\" is probably the sustained first note, with a rhythmic pattern in the background. This device was used in 1962 for the successful song \\"Sherry\\" (1962) by the Four Seasons and again on the Beatles' \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" (on the album A Hard Day's Night), in 1964. Channel's only other top 40 recording in the UK Singles Chart was \\"Keep On\\" (June 1968), which reached number 12; it was written by Wayne Carson Thompson and produced by Dale Hawkins. \\"Keep On\\" also charted in Australia. Channel disliked touring, so he settled as a songwriter in Nashville, scoring a number of Broadcast Music Incorporated award-winning songs during the 1970s and 1980s ‚Äì \\"As Long As I'm Rockin' with You\\", for John Conlee; \\"Don't Worry 'bout Me Baby\\", for Janie Fricke; \\"Party Time\\", for T. G. Sheppard; \\"You're the Best\\", for Kieran Kane; and \\"Stand Up\\", for Mel McDaniel. In 1987, \\"Hey! Baby\\" was featured in the popular movie Dirty Dancing. In 1995, Channel recorded his cover of the song \\"Stand Up\\" for the Memphis-based record label Ice House. Delbert McClinton reprised his harmonica role on it and several other tracks, including another version of \\"Hey! Baby\\". Channel then recorded a project in 2002 with the singer-songwriter Larry Henley (ex-Newbeats), billed as Original Copy. Channel was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

In most cases, chromism is based on a change in the electron states of molecules, especially the œÄ- or d-electron state, so this phenomenon is induced by various external stimuli which can alter the electron density of substances. It is known that there are many natural compounds that have chromism, and many artificial compounds with specific chromism have been synthesized to date. Chromism is classified by what kind of stimuli are used. Examples of the major kinds of chromism are as follows. * thermochromism is chromism that is induced by heat, that is, a change of temperature. This is the most common chromism of all. * photochromism is induced by light irradiation. This phenomenon is based on the isomerization between two different molecular structures, light-induced formation of color centers in crystals, precipitation of metal particles in a glass, or other mechanisms. * electrochromism is induced by the gain and loss of electrons. This phenomenon occurs in compounds with redox active sites, such as metal ions or organic radicals. *solvatochromism depends on the polarity of the solvent. Most solvatochromic compounds are metal complexes. There are many more chromisms and these are listed in the colour change phenomena section. The output from the chromisms described above is observed by a change in the absorption spectra of the chromic material. An increasingly important group of chromisms are those where changes are displayed in their emission spectra. Hence they are called fluorochromisms, exemplified by solvatofluorochromism, electrofluorochromism and mechanofluorochromism. Chromic phenomena Chromic phenomena are those phenomena in which color is produced when light interacts with materials, often called chromic materials in a variety of ways. These can be categorized under the following five headings: *Stimulated (reversible) color change *The absorption and reflection of light *The absorption of energy followed by the emission of light *The absorption of light and energy transfer (or conversion) *The manipulation of light.  Color change phenomena Those phenomena which involve the change in color of a chemical compound under an external stimulus fall under the generic term of chromisms. They take their individual names from the type of the external influence, which can be either chemical or physical, that is involved. Many of these phenomena are reversible. The following list includes all the classic chromisms plus many others of increasing interest in newer outlets. *Photochromism ‚Äì color change caused by light. *Thermochromism ‚Äì color change caused by temperature. *Electrochromism ‚Äì color change caused by an electric current. *Gasochromism- color change caused by a gas - hydrogen/oxygen redox. *Solvatochromism ‚Äì color change caused by solvent polarity. *Concentratochromism ‚Äì color change caused by changes in the concentration in the medium *Rigidichromism ‚Äì colour change caused by changes in the rigidity of the medium. *Vapochromism ‚Äì color change caused by vapour of an organic compound due to chemical polarity/polarisation. *Ionochromism ‚Äì color change caused by ions. *Halochromism ‚Äì color change caused by a change in pH. *Metallochromism ‚Äì color change caused by metal ions. *Mechanochromism ‚Äì color change caused by mechanical actions. *Tribochromism ‚Äì color change caused by mechanical friction. *Piezochromism ‚Äì color change caused by mechanical pressure. *Cathodochromism ‚Äì color change caused by electron beam irradiation. *Radiochromism ‚Äì color change caused by ionising radiation. *Magnetochromism ‚Äì color change caused by magnetic field. *Biochromism ‚Äì color change caused by interfacing with a biological entity. *Amorphochromism ‚Äì color change caused by changes in crystalline habitat. *Cryochromism ‚Äì color change caused by lowering of temperature. *Hydrochromism ‚Äì color change caused by interaction with bulk water or humidity. *Chronochromism ‚Äì color change indirectly as a result of the passage of time. *Aggregachromism ‚Äì color change on dimerisation/aggregation of chromophores. *Crystallochromism ‚Äì color change due to changes in crystal structure of a chromophore. *Sorptiochromism ‚Äì color change when a species is surface adsorbed. There are also chromisms which involve two or more stimuli. Examples include: *Photoelectrochromism ‚Äì Photovoltachromism ‚Äì Bioelectrochromism ‚Äì Solvatophotochromism ‚Äì Thermosolvatochromism ‚Äì Halosolvatochromism ‚Äì Electromechanochromism. Color changes are also observed on the interaction of metallic nanoparticles and their attached ligands with another stimulus. Examples include plasmonic solvatochromism, plasmonic ionochromism, plasmonic chronochromism and plasmonic vapochromism. Commercial applications Color change materials have been used in several very common outlets but also in an increasing number of new ones. Commercial applications include photochromics in ophthalmics, fashion/cosmetics, security, sensors, optical memory and optical switches, thermochromics in paints, inks, plastics and textiles as indicators/sensors and in architecture, ionochromics in copy paper, direct thermal printing and textile sensors, electrochromics in car mirrors, smart windows, flexible devices and solar protection, solvatochromics in biological probes and sensors, gasochromics in windows and gas sensors. Dyes and pigments Classical dyes and pigments produce color by the absorption and reflection of light; these are the materials that make a major impact on the color of our daily lives. In 2000, world production of organic dyes was 800,000 tonnes and of organic pigments, 250,000 tonnes and the volume has grown at a steady rate throughout the early years of this century. In 2019 the value of the organic dyes/pigments market is forecast to be $19.5bn. Their value is exceeded by the very large production of inorganic pigments. Organic dyes are used mainly to color textile fibers, paper, hair, leather, while pigments are used largely in inks, paints, plastic and cosmetics. Both are used in the growth area of the digital printing of textiles, paper and other surfaces. Dyes are also made using the properties of chromic substances: Examples being Photochromic dyes and Thermochromic dyes Luminescence The absorption of energy followed by the emission of light is often described by the term luminescence. The exact term used is based on the energy source responsible for the luminescence as in color-change phenomena. *Electrical ‚Äì electroluminescence Galvanoluminescence Sonoluminescence. *Photons (light) ‚Äì Photoluminescence Fluorescence Phosphorescence Biofluorescence. *Chemical ‚Äì Chemiluminescence Bioluminescence Electrochemiluminescence. *Thermal ‚Äì Thermoluminescence Pyroluminescence Candololuminescence. *Electron Beam ‚Äì Cathodoluminescence Anodoluminescence Radioluminescence. *Mechanical ‚Äì Triboluminescence Fractoluminescence Mechanoluminescence Crystalloluminescence Lyoluminescence Elasticoluminescence. Many of these phenomena are widely used in consumer products and other important outlets. Cathodoluminescence is used in cathode ray tubes, photoluminescence in fluorescent lighting and plasma display panels, phosphorescence in safety signs and low energy lighting, fluorescence in pigments, inks, optical brighteners, safety clothing, and biological and medicinal analysis and diagnostics, chemoluminescence and bioluminescence in analysis, diagnostics and sensors, and electroluminescence in the burgeoning areas of light-emitting diodes (LEDs/OLEDs), displays and panel lighting. Important new developments are taking place in the areas of quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles. Light and energy transfer Absorption of light and energy transfer (or conversion) involves colored molecules that can transfer electromagnetic energy, commonly in the form of a laser light source, to other molecules in another form of energy, such as thermal or electrical. These laser addressable colorants, also called near- infrared absorbers, are used in thermal energy conversion, photosensitisation of chemical reactions and the selective absorption of light. Applications areas include optical data storage, as organic photoconductors, as sensitisers in photomedicine, such as photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy in the treatment of cancer, in photodiagnosis and phototheranostics, and in the photoinactivation of microbes, blood and insects. The absorption of natural sunlight by chromic materials/chromophores is exploited in solar cells for the production of electrical energy via solar cells, using both inorganic photovoltaics and organic materials (organic photovoltaics) and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and also in the production of useful chemicals via artificial photosynthesis. A developing area is the conversion of light into kinetic energy, often described under the generic term of lightdriven/molecular machines. Light manipulation Materials may be used to control and manipulate light via a variety of mechanisms to produce useful effects involving colour. For instance, a change of orientation of molecules to produce a visual effect as in liquid crystal displays. Other materials operate by producing a physical effect, by interference and diffraction as in lustre pigments and optically variable pigments, colloidal photonic crystals and in holography. Increasingly inspiration is coming from Nature, in the form of bioinspired structural colours. Molecular materials are also used to increase the intensity of light by modifying its movement through the materials by electrical means, so increasing its intensity as in organic lasers, or in modifying the transmission of light through materials, as in opto-electronics, or by purely by all optical means as in optical limiters.

It was active from 1995 to 2009. Activities Generally considered the first national political organization devoted to issues of \\"gender identity and expression\\" and representing the transgender community, GenderPAC aimed to promote understanding of the connection between discrimination based on gender stereotypes and gender, sexual orientation, age, race and class. GenderPAC's major programs were Workplace Fairness, Gender Equality National Index for Universities & Schools (GENIUS) Congressional Diversity Pledge, GenderYOUTH Network, and the Children As They Are parenting network. The organization argued that violence and discrimination based on gender variance was not limited to people who identified as trans. It was often, however, categorised as a transgender rights organization. GenderPAC's annual budget grew to $250,000 in its first five years of existence, and topped out at $1,200,000 when it ceased operations in 2009. Most of its revenue came from LGBT funders and also from corporate sponsorships, with small amounts from individual donor contributions and events. History GenderPAC was founded in 1995 by Riki Wilchins as an association of existing transgender organizations, in response to a lack of inclusion of transgender and gender-variant issues by national gay and lesbian organizations, and grew quickly. Its areas of activism included incidents of discrimination against trans and gender-variant people, as well as youth and issues of workplace fairness. In 1996, the group began holding National Gender Lobby Days, during which activists would meet with members of Congress to discuss discrimination and violence. One part of these events was a Congressional Diversity Pledge, which asked Members of Congress to affirm that their own office would not discriminate against employees because of their \\"gender identity or expression.\\" Signers included Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, and Carolyn Maloney. Eventually almost 200 Members signed the Pledge, including two dozen Republicans and over a dozen Senators. In 1997, GenderPAC produced The First National Study on Transviolence, a large research project on violence against transgender and gender-variant people. It was cited in the political struggle for hate crime protections for trans people. GenderPAC was a member of the Hate Crimes Coalition that effected in 1999 the introduction of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, eventually passed in 2009. When the organization was founded, passing a trans-inclusive version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) was a priority. After GenderPAC visited Congressional offices in preparation for a Lobby Days event, with an HRC lobbyist along, allegations were offered by some transgender activists that Human Rights Campaign might have persuaded GenderPAC to shift its support to hate crime laws, saying that this would be more politically efficacious. However, GenderPAC fervently denied this, and no actual evidence for the allegations was ever provided. The organization formally organized in 1999, with a new board of directors comprising individuals instead of groups, and received tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. GenderPAC held the first National Conference on Gender in 2001, coinciding with the sixth annual Gender Lobby Days; one speaker was NOW president Patricia Ireland. The June 2001 issue of Time named Wilchins one of 100 national innovators. In 2006 with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published \\"50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War on America‚Äôs Youth\\". The first human rights report on fatal violence against gender-variant youth, \\"50 Under 30\\" documented an epidemic of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under from 1996 to 2006. 82% were black or Latina/o, and virtually all were male-to-female transsexuals. Most were attacked by assailants within 5 to 10 years of their own age. In 2008, with 17 new murders in just two years, the report was updated and reissued as \\"70 Under 30\\" help from the NYC Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, which eventually took over the project and integrated it into its annual hate crimes report. Over 100 national and local groups endorsed the findings of \\"50 Under 30,\\" which was also adopted by members of the Hate Crimes Coalition on Capitol Hill, and provided by HRC to members of sub-committee that marked up the Mathew Shepherd Hate Crimes Act. The report was used by the House Hate Crimes Subcommittee, the federal-level activist Hate Crimes Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, and the NYC Anti-Violence Project. On May 28, 2009, GenderPAC closed its doors and shut down its website, citing the number of other organizations now doing the work that it was originally created for. Its GenderYOUTH network and resources were transferred to Choice USA. Criticism GenderPAC exemplified what certain feminists opposed about queer rights movements and certain elements of gender studies: Sheila Jeffreys wrote that its aims ignored women in favor of \\"transgenders , most of whom are men, and homosexuality,\\" and that the organization's conception of gender as something that should be protected, and the basis for individuals rights that needed to be respected rather than eliminated, would serve to reinforce discrimination. Conversely, other transgender rights organizations were angered by GenderPAC's rejection of the label of a transgender organization and to focus on trans issues. These latter criticized GenderPAC's reputed shift of focus away from a trans-inclusive ENDA at the supposed prompting of HRC, their unwillingness to engage with identity categories, and what they saw as a \\"violation\\" or exclusion of trans people through the use of their stories to raise money which was not spent primarily on trans issues. In fact, GenderPAC's Board and constituency remained heavily transgender from its founding until it ceased operations. Wilchins proposed that the focus of a gender rights struggle to be about the issue of gender discrimination, rather than identity of transgender, which might leave out many of those who suffered discrimination. This view brought the organization to crisis when it took on the case of a self-identified \\"butch lesbian\\" who sought help after being repeatedly harassed at work and ultimately fired for allegedly looking \\"too masculine.\\" Many on the Board said GenderPAC should only help transgender- identified individuals; others, including Wilchins, maintained that it was the issue of gender discrimination, rather than individual identity, that was paramount. It was a divide that GenderPAC struggled to bridge during its entire time in existence, and in many ways came to define the organization.

Rarely, the activity may also involve jumping between moving elevators, although most elevator surfers consider this to be unwise and needlessly dangerous. Elevator surfing is illegal in many locations, and several people have died or were injured. Surfers can be crushed between the elevator and the top or sides of the elevator shaft, be struck by the counterweight, or slip and fall to their deaths. In 1997 a person died when they were riding on the top of a lift and then at one point they fell from it 8 floors to the foot of the lift shaft below. The surfer does have the ability to stop the elevator at any time by pressing the emergency stop button on the roof of the elevator car, decreasing the risk of being crushed against the top of the shaft. Elevator surfing typically occurs in skyscrapers or on college campuses, especially those with tall buildings. Most large buildings have groups of elevators close together, which are most commonly used. To begin, participants will usually go into such a building early in the morning, before too many people arrive to use the elevators, or late at night, when most of the building's occupants have left. Entry into the elevator shaft is usually achieved by using a special key to open the outer doors or, if the key cannot be accessed, by lock picking. Alternatively, participants may force the elevator car's doors open between floors and unlatch the outer doors from the inside. A common misconception is that the emergency hatch in the roof of the elevator can be opened from inside of the elevator car. However, this is rarely the case, and these are, instead, designed for the use of emergency crews to rescue trapped passengers. This activity typically takes place when there is not much movement with the elevators, which lowers the risk and involvement. Accomplices will sometimes press buttons on the inside of the elevators to provide the movement. Movement can also be provided by means of service controls located on top of the elevator car, which allow complete control over the movement of the elevator, but at a reduced speed.

Background The transgender symbol Wilchins founded the first national transgender advocacy group (GenderPAC). Her analysis and work broadened over time to include discrimination and violence regardless of individuals' identity. While this perspective has been widely accepted, its breadth has provoked criticism by some in the transgender community. Wilchins's work and writing have often focused on youth, whom she not only sees as uniquely vulnerable to the gender system's pressures and harm, but whom she sees as capable of \\"looking with fresh eyes.\\" Wilchins's work has been instrumental in bringing transgender rights into the mainstream LGBT movement, and has helped bring awareness of the impact of gender norms to a wider audience, and she is credited with coining the term \\"genderqueer.\\" Wilchins's early activism with the \\"Hermaphrodites With Attitude!\\" protest group and intersex leader Cheryl Chase led to the founding of Intersex Awareness Day. In 2001, Wilchins's work resulted in her being selected one of just six community activists named by TIME Magazine among its \\"100 Civic Innovators for the 21st Century.\\" A founding member of Camp Trans, since the mid-1990s Wilchins has been highly active in founding a number of organizations and events focused on gender issues, including: * The Menace, the first large direct action group for transgender rights, which was modeled along the lines of Queer Nation and which at one point boasted representatives in 40+ cities (co-founder Denise Norris). * a 1996 demonstration held with members of Intersex Society of North America, now marked as Intersex Awareness Day. * NYC Gay Community Center Gender Identity Project (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services). * NYC Gay Community Center Transgender Health Empowerment Conference, an annual event (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services). * Camp Trans, an annual educational event outside the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival that contested the exclusion of anyone who was not deemed a \\"womyn-born womyn\\" (co-founders Janice Walworth, Nancy Jean Burkholder). * National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (co- founder Susan Wright, its first Exec. Dir.) * National Gender Lobby Day, an annual event on Capitol Hill (co-founder Phyllis Frye). GenderPAC In 1995 Wilchins founded the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition, GenderPAC, a tax-exempt organization focused on gender rights issues. GenderPAC originally focused on the transgender community, but gradually broadened its focus to include anyone who suffered discrimination or violence because of their gender identity or gender expression. GenderPAC described its mission as the creation of \\"classrooms, communities, and workplaces [that] are safe for everyone to learn, grow, and succeed ‚Äî whether or not they meet expectations for masculinity and femininity.\\" In late 1999, the organization was incorporated and received tax-exempt status. In 2009 it rebranded and relaunched as a new organization, effectively ceasing operations as GenderPAC. While GenderPAC's Executive Director, Wilchins helped dozens of corporations as diverse as IBM, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, as well as major funders like the Arcus and Gill Foundations to expand their employment non-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression. GenderPAC's Congressional Non- Discrimination Pledge eventually had almost 200 sponsors, including both Republicans and US Senators. She helped compile and publish the GENIUS (Gender Equality National Index for Universities & Schools) Index, which rated and ranked schools' adoption of gender identity protections. During her watch, GenderPAC also launched the GenderYOUTH Network, which eventually supported student groups at 100+ schools in creating safer and friendlier environments for those who were gender non-conforming on their own campuses. 1st National Survey of TransViolence In 1995, with help from researcher Emilia Lombardi, GenderPAC compiled and published the \\"1st National Survey of TransViolence,\\" based on surveys provided by more than 500 respondents. In 2006, in partnership with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published \\"50 Under 30: Masculinity & the War on America's Youth,\\" the first human rights report to document an under-reported tide of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under attacked because of their gender identity or gender expression from 1994-2004. With a fresh round of attacks, the report was reissued just two years later as \\"70 Under 30.\\" More than 80 groups endorsed the reports' recommendations, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National Organization for Women (NOW), National Council of La Raza (NCLR), Interfaith Alliance, and the Human Rights Campaign. The report was used by the House Sub-Committee which marked up the Matthew Shepard Hate Crime Act (the final bill included gender identity as a protected category and was eventually passed and signed into law). Wilchins received her bachelor's degree from Cleveland State University in 1982 and her masters in clinical psychology from the New School for Social Research in 1983. She then founded Data Tree Inc., a computer consulting company specializing in banking and brokerage on Wall Street. Wilchins is an out transsexual lesbian feminist.

A- Steam from boiler, B- Needle valve, C- Needle valve handle, D- Steam and water combine, E- Water feed, F- Combining cone, G- Delivery nozzle and cone, H- delivery chamber and pipe, K- Check valve, L- Overflow An injector is a system of ducting and nozzles used to direct the flow of a high-pressure fluid in such a way that a lower pressure fluid is entrained in the jet and carried through a duct to a region of higher pressure. It is a fluid-dynamic pump with no moving parts, excepting a valve to control inlet flow. A steam injector is a typical application of the principle used to deliver cold water to a boiler against its own pressure, using its own live or exhaust steam, replacing any mechanical pump. When first developed, its operation was intriguing because it seemed paradoxical, almost like perpetual motion, but it was later explained using thermodynamics. Other types of injector may use other pressurised motive fluids such as air. Depending on the application, an injector can also take the form of an eductor-jet pump, a water eductor or an aspirator. An ejector operates on similar principles to create a vacuum feed connection for braking systems etc. History The injector was invented by Henri Giffard in 1858, for use on steam locomotives , and patented in the United Kingdom by Messrs Sharp Stewart & Co. of Glasgow. After some initial scepticism resulting from the unfamiliar and superficially paradoxical mode of operation, the injector became widely adopted for steam locomotives as an alternative to mechanical pumps. Operation The injector consists of a body filled with a secondary fluid, into which a motive fluid is injected. The motive fluid induces the secondary fluid to move. Injectors exist in many variations, and can have several stages, each repeating the same basic operating principle, to increase their overall effect. It uses the Venturi effect of a converging-diverging nozzle on a steam jet to convert the pressure energy of the steam to velocity energy, reducing its pressure to below that of the atmosphere, which enables it to entrain a fluid (eg. water). After passing through the convergent \\"combining cone\\", the mixed fluid is fully condensed, releasing the latent heat of evaporation of the steam which imparts extra velocity to the water. The condensate mixture then enters a divergent \\"delivery cone\\" which slows the jet, converting kinetic energy back into static pressure energy above the pressure of the boiler enabling its feed through a non-return valve.‚ÄúTHE STEAM INJECTOR.‚Äù BY MR.F.T.BARWELL, G.W.R. MECHANICS‚Äô INSTITUTE. SWINDON ENGINEERING SOCIETY. TRANSACTIONS, 1929-30. ORDINARY MEETING. ‚Äî JANUARY 21ST, 1930 Most of the heat energy in the condensed steam is returned to the boiler, increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. Injectors are therefore typically over 98% energy-efficient overall; they are also simple compared to the many moving parts in a feed pump. Steam injector of a locomotive boiler The motive fluid may be a liquid, steam or any other gas. The entrained suction fluid may be a gas, a liquid, a slurry, or a dust-laden gas stream. =Key design parameters= Fluid feed rate and operating pressure range are the key parameters of an injector, and vacuum pressure and evacuation rate are the key parameters for an ejector. Compression ratio and the entrainment ratio may also be defined: The compression ratio of the injector, P_2/P_1, is defined as ratio of the injector's outlet pressure P_2 to the inlet pressure of the suction fluid P_1. The entrainment ratio of the injector, W_s/W_m, is defined as the amount W_s (in kg/h) of suction fluid that can be entrained and compressed by a given amount W_m (in kg/h) of motive fluid. =Lifting properties= Other key properties of an injector include the fluid inlet pressure requirements i.e. whether it is lifting or non-lifting. In a non- lifting injector, positive inlet fluid pressure is needed e.g. the cold water input is fed by gravity. The steam-cone minimal orifice diameter is kept larger than the combining cone minimal diameter. The non-lifting Nathan 4000 injector used on the Southern Pacific 4294 could push 12,000 US gallons (45,000 L) per hour at 250 psi (17 bar). The lifting injector can operate with negative inlet fluid pressure i.e. fluid lying below the level of the injector. It differs from the non-lifting type mainly in the relative dimensions of the nozzles.The Model Injector, Ted Crawford, Tee Publishing =Overflow= An overflow is required for excess steam or water to discharge, especially during starting. If the injector cannot initially overcome boiler pressure, the overflow allows the injector to continue to draw water and steam. =Check valve= There is at least one check valve (called a \\"clack valve\\" in locomotives because of the distinctive noise it makes) between the exit of the injector and the boiler to prevent back flow, and usually a valve to prevent air being sucked in at the overflow. =Exhaust steam injector= Efficiency was further improved by the development of a multi-stage injector which is powered not by live steam from the boiler but by exhaust steam from the cylinders, thereby making use of the residual energy in the exhaust steam which would otherwise go to waste. However, an exhaust injector also cannot work when the locomotive is stationary; later exhaust injectors could use a supply of live steam if no exhaust steam was available. =Problems= Injectors can be troublesome under certain running conditions, such as when vibration causes the combined steam and water jet to \\"knock off\\". Originally the injector had to be restarted by careful manipulation of the steam and water controls, and the distraction caused by a malfunctioning injector was largely responsible for the 1913 Ais Gill rail accident. Later injectors were designed to automatically restart on sensing the collapse in vacuum from the steam jet, for example with a spring-loaded delivery cone. Another common problem occurs when the incoming water is too warm and is less effective at condensing the steam in the combining cone. That can also occur if the metal body of the injector is too hot, e.g. from prolonged use. =Vacuum ejectors= Diagram of a typical modern ejector An additional use for the injector technology is in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw air out of the vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The exhaust from the ejectors is invariably directed to the smokebox, by which means it assists the blower in draughting the fire. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam and is only required to operate when the train is moving. Vacuum brakes have been superseded by air brakes in modern trains, which allow the use of smaller brake cylinders and/or higher braking force due to the greater difference from atmospheric pressure. =Earlier application of the principle= Sketch of the smokebox of a steam locomotive, rotated 90 degrees. The similarity to the generic injector diagram at the top of this article is apparent. An empirical application of the principle was in widespread use on steam locomotives before its formal development as the injector, in the form of the arrangement of the blastpipe and chimney in the locomotive smokebox. The sketch on the right shows a cross section through a smokebox, rotated 90 degrees; it can be seen that the same components are present, albeit differently named, as in the generic diagram of an injector at the top of the article. Exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed through a nozzle on the end of the blastpipe, to reduce pressure inside the smokebox by entraining the flue gases from the boiler which are then ejected via the chimney. The effect is to increase the draught on the fire to a degree proportional to the rate of steam consumption, so that as more steam is used, more heat is generated from the fire and steam production is also increased. The effect was first noted by Richard Trevithick and subsequently developed empirically by the early locomotive engineers; Stephenson's Rocket made use of it, and this constitutes much of the reason for its notably improved performance in comparison with contemporary machines. Modern uses The use of injectors (or ejectors) in various industrial applications has become quite common due to their relative simplicity and adaptability. For example: * To inject chemicals into the boiler drums of small, stationary, low pressure boilers. In large, high-pressure modern boilers, usage of injectors for chemical dosing is not possible due to their limited outlet pressures. * In thermal power stations, they are used for the removal of the boiler bottom ash, the removal of fly ash from the hoppers of the electrostatic precipitators used to remove that ash from the boiler flue gas, and for drawing a vacuum pressure in steam turbine exhaust condensers. * Jet pumps have been used in boiling water nuclear reactors to circulate the coolant fluid. * For use in producing a vacuum pressure in steam jet cooling systems. * For expansion work recovery in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. * For enhanced oil recovery processes in the oil & gas Industry. * For the bulk handling of grains or other granular or powdered materials. * The construction industry uses them for pumping turbid water and slurries. * Eductors are used in ships to pump residual ballast water, or cargo oil which cannot be removed using centrifugal pumps due to loss of suction head and may damage the centrifugal pump if run dry, which may be caused due to trim or list of the ship. * Eductors are used on-board ships to pump out bilges, since using centrifugal pump would not be feasible as the suction head may be lost frequently. * Some aircraft (mostly earlier designs) use an ejector attached to the fuselage to provide vacuum for gyroscopic instruments such as an attitude indicator (artificial horizon). * Eductors are used in aircraft fuel systems as transfer pumps; fluid flow from an engine-mounted mechanical pump can be delivered to a fuel tank-mounted eductor to transfer fuel from that tank. * Aspirators are vacuum pumps based on the same operating principle and are used in laboratories to create a partial vacuum and for medical use in suction of mucus or bodily fluids. * Water eductors are water pumps used for dredging silt and panning for gold, they're used because they can handle the highly abrasive mixtures quite well. * To create vacuum system in vacuum distillation unit (oil refinery). * Vacuum autoclaves use an ejector to pull a vacuum, generally powered by the cold water supply to the machine. * Low weight jet pumps can be made out of paper mache. Well pumps Jet pumps are commonly used to extract water from water wells. The main pump, often a centrifugal pump, is powered and installed at ground level. Its discharge is split, with the greater part of the flow leaving the system, while a portion of the flow is returned to the jet pump installed below ground in the well. This recirculated part of the pumped fluid is used to power the jet. At the jet pump, the high-energy, low-mass returned flow drives more fluid from the well, becoming a low-energy, high-mass flow which is then piped to the inlet of the main pump. The S type pump is useful for removing water from a well or container. Shallow well pumps are those in which the jet assembly is attached directly to the main pump and are limited to a depth of approximately 5-8m to prevent cavitation. Deep well pumps are those in which the jet is located at the bottom of the well. The maximum depth for deep well pumps is determined by the inside diameter of and the velocity through the jet. The major advantage of jet pumps for deep well installations is the ability to situate all mechanical parts (e.g., electric/petrol motor, rotating impellers) at the ground surface for easy maintenance. The advent of the electrical submersible pump has partly replaced the need for jet type well pumps, except for driven point wells or surface water intakes. Multi-stage steam vacuum ejectors In practice, for suction pressure below 100 mbar absolute, more than one ejector is used, usually with condensers between the ejector stages. Condensing of motive steam greatly improves ejector set efficiency; both barometric and shell-and-tube surface condensers are used. In operation a two-stage system consists of a primary high-vacuum (HV) ejector and a secondary low-vacuum (LV) ejector. Initially the LV ejector is operated to pull vacuum down from the starting pressure to an intermediate pressure. Once this pressure is reached, the HV ejector is then operated in conjunction with the LV ejector to finally pull vacuum to the required pressure. In operation a three-stage system consists of a primary booster, a secondary high-vacuum (HV) ejector, and a tertiary low-vacuum (LV) ejector. As per the two-stage system, initially the LV ejector is operated to pull vacuum down from the starting pressure to an intermediate pressure. Once this pressure is reached, the HV ejector is then operated in conjunction with the LV ejector to pull vacuum to the lower intermediate pressure. Finally the booster is operated (in conjunction with the HV & LV ejectors) to pull vacuum to the required pressure. Construction materials Injectors or ejectors are made of carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, titanium, PTFE, carbon, and other materials.

The name is cognate with Cornwall in neighbouring Great Britain. This can be explained by the settlement of Cornouaille by migrant princes from Cornwall who created an independent principality founded by Rivelen Mor Marthou, and the founding of the Bishopric of Cornouaille by ancient saints from Cornwall. Celtic Britons and the settlers in Brittany spoke a common language, this language would evolved into Breton, Welsh and Cornish. Etymology The toponym Cornouaille was established in the early Middle Ages in the southwest of the Breton peninsula.Isaac Taylor, Names and Their Histories: A Handbook of Historical Geography and Topographical Nomenclature, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, p.70 Prior to this, following the withdrawal of Rome from Britain, other British migrants from what is now modern Devon had established the region of Domnonea (in Breton) or Domnon√©e (in French) in the north of the peninsula, taken from the Latin Dumnonia. The region was first mentioned in surviving records by a Cornouaille-related name between 852 and 857, when Anaweten, bishop of Saint- Corentin at Quimper Cathedral, took over Cornugallensis under the order of Nominoe, Duke of Brittany and Tad ar Vro. The names Cornwall and Cornouaille, like the surname Cornwallis, are from Corn-wealas. The first element is from the name of a Brythonic tribe Latinized as Cornovii, meaning 'peninsula people', from the Celtic kernou, 'horn, headland'. It is a cognate of the English word horn, both being from PIE *ker- 'uppermost part of the body, head, horn, top, summit',. The second element is the Anglo-Saxon suffix -wealas, from walh, a word used by the Germanic speakers for 'a non-Germanic foreigner', especially Celtic speakers but also sometimes used for Romance- language speakers. Walh is an element found in the words and names walnut, Walloon, Wales, Wallachia, Wallace, Walcheren, and Walsh. A Corn-/Kern- name was used in reference to the resettling of the new wave Celts from Great Britain in formerly Dumnonian-seized lands. This is related to the difference between Grande-Bretagne (Great Britain) and Bretagne (Brittany) in French, with Brittany having originally been thought of a British colony (and the second such in the same area). In Breton, Cornouaille is known as Kernev or Bro-Gernev, and in Latin as Cornugallia or Cornubia. In Cornish, Kernev is written Kernow, but the pronunciation is the same. History Strong contacts between Armorica (a larger region than the Duchy of Brittany or modern Brittany) and southern Britain had already been noted by Julius Caesar. Native British troops were hired to support the usurpation of Magnus Maximus, who is said to have settled them in Armorica. Settlements expanded when invading Anglo-Saxons expanded westward within Britain.L√©on Fleuriot, Les origines de la Bretagne, √âd. Payot, 1980 Strong links existed in the 6th century between the British and Armorican territories. Legends about King Arthur and the Matter of Britain make frequent reference to the maritime connections between the peoples of Wales, southern Ireland, Cornwall in southwestern Britain and the early kingdoms of Brittany, cf. the tale of Tristan and Iseult. The existence of an ancient district in Anjou called \\"la Cornuaille\\" has led to the hypothesis that Cornouaille may have been a geographical or military label for all of southern Brittany as far as the northern shore of Domnon√©e in the 6th or 7th century. At the origin of this feudal county, the reigning dynasty acceded to a dukedom of the region, which then passed to the Ancient Lord- Bishop of Quimper. Diocese The name Cornouaille signifies the diocese of Quimper which persisted until the French Revolution. The diocese covered more than half of the south of Finist√®re, and extended over part of Morbihan and the C√¥tes-d'Armor. There were two archdeacons, one for Cornouaille and one for Poher. There were also a cantor, a treasurer, a theologian and twelve canons. This episcopal division was the poorest in Brittany. After the French Revolution, the new constitution created a diocese of Finist√®re, erasing that of the diocese of Kerne (Cournouaille); most of the old diocese was absorbed into the new.

It is the outflow from Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti, and flows northwards for , emptying into the Bay of Plenty near Te Puke. It was the subject of a claim concerning the effluent flowing down the river from Lake Rotorua, which resulted in movement to a land treatment system. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"eat eels\\" for Kaituna. The upper section of the Kaituna, also referred to as Okere River, offers some of the best whitewater kayaking and rafting in the world, with the Okere Falls area containing the highest commercially rafted waterfall, , in the world. It is also famous for its trout fishing. Cultural claim During the 1970s Lake Rotorua was becoming eutrophic under heavy nutrient loadings, leading the Ministry of Works to propose diverting some sewage flow into the Kaituna River. Local iwi objected however, and filed a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal. Their objections included the insult to other iwi (leading to loss of mana) and destruction of the rivers mauri (life force or essence) which they believed would destroy its ability to sustain aquatic life. The Ministry of Works report however stated that the mauri concept was essentially religious in nature and not scientifically verifiable, while on the other hand diluting the waste would help prevent excess pollution and keep costs at a reasonable level. In MƒÅori culture religion and science are not treated separately as they tend to be in Western culture. In 1990 however, the Rotorua Land Treatment Scheme saw an upgrade to treatment facilities to remove 80% of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent, and land application to reduce eutrophication and satisfy MƒÅori cultural wishes. This has led to better environmental, economic and cultural outcomes for all parties. Power generation The upper reaches of the Kaituna river was the site of a small power station which was in operation from 1901 to 1936, the first generating plant built by the New Zealand government. Several proposals for a larger power station have been considered, however the high cost of these projects has meant that none have been built to date. In 2008 there was a consultation regarding the installation of a new hydro electric power dam below the river at the end of Trout Pool Road. This would involve the creation of a man made dam and the flooding of some land, destroying a section of river known as \\"Awesome Gorge\\" and leaving the section known as \\"Gnarly Gorge\\" with a highly reduced flow. Kayaking and rafting groups and local iwi raised objections. Whitewater The Kaituna River is a world-famous white-water destination. The river has been run regularly by rafting and kayak since 1991. It is used for recreational kayaking, commercial tandem kayaking, rafting and sledging. It is a winter destination for paddlers from the northern hemisphere. The entrance to the upper gorge contains a slalom course that has been used by international teams for their off-season training prior to world championships and Olympic competition. The upper gorge contains a number of play features, including the famous \\"bottom hole\\". The entire river has been run. The temperate rainforest, warm water, and its unusual character means the river is well known in international whitewater kayak videos. Notable waterfalls in the upper gorge are Okere Falls, Tutea Falls (the highest commercially rafted waterfall), and Trout Pool Falls, all of which are accessible via the Okere Falls track. tutea falls.jpgTutea Falls The Weir.jpgThe Weir Okere falls.jpgOkere Falls and The Weir Bottom hole.jpgBottom Play Hole Bottom play hole.jpgBottom Play Hole References Category:Treaty of Waitangi Category:Rivers of the Bay of Plenty Region Category:Rivers of New Zealand ","title":"Kaituna River"},{"id":"1164744","text":"Stater of Tincomarus, king of the Atrebates. Tincomarus (a dithematic name form typical of insular and continental Celtic onomastics, analysable as tinco-, perhaps a sort of fish [cf Latin tinca, English tench] + maro-, \\"big\\") was a king of the Iron Age Belgic tribe of the Atrebates who lived in southern central Britain shortly before the Roman invasion. His name was previously reconstructed as Tincommius, based on abbreviated coin legends and a damaged mention in Augustus's Res Gestae, but since 1996 coins have been discovered which give his full name. He was the son and heir of Commius and succeeded his father around 25-20 BC. Based on coin distribution it is possible that Tincomarus ruled in collaboration with his father for the last few years of Commius's life. Little is known of his reign although numismatic evidence suggests that he was more sympathetic to Rome than his father was in later years: the coins he issued much more closely resemble Roman types, and are so much better made that they must have come from professional Roman die-cutters. GC Boon has suggested that this technical advance was not limited to coinage and represents wider industrial assistance from the Roman Empire. Tincomarus's successors used the term rex on their coins and this indicates that Tincomarus had begun the process of achieving client kingdom status with Rome (see Roman client kingdoms in Britain). John Creighton argues, based on the imagery used on his coins, that Tincomarus may have been brought up as an obses (diplomatic hostage) in Rome in the early years of Augustus's reign. He compares Tincomarus's coins to those of Juba II of Numidia, who is known to have been an obses, and identifies a coin found in Numidia which may bear the name of Tincomarus's younger brother Verica. By 16 BC Roman pottery and other imports appear in considerable quantities at Tincomarus's capital of Calleva Atrebatum, today known as Silchester, and it is likely that the Atrebatic king had established trading and diplomatic links with Augustus. Tincomarus was expelled by his subjects for unknown reasons around AD 8 and fled to Rome as a refugee and supplicant. He was replaced by his brother Eppillus whom Augustus chose to recognise as rex rather than depose and reinstate Tincomarus. Augustus may have planned to use his ally's ejection as an excuse to invade Britain but other, more pressing foreign policy matters probably persuaded him to postpone the move.

Hot flue gases created in the firebox (on the left) pass through the tubes in the centre cylindrical section, which is filled with water, to the smokebox and out of the chimney (stack) at far right. The steam collects along the top of the boiler and in the steam dome roughly halfway along the top, where it then flows into the large pipe seen running forward. It is then divided into each side and runs downward in the steam chest (at the rear of the smoke box), where it is then admitted into the cylinders by means of valves. A fire-tube boiler is a type of boiler in which hot gases pass from a fire through one or (many) more tubes running through a sealed container of water. The heat of the gases is transferred through the walls of the tubes by thermal conduction, heating the water and ultimately creating steam. The fire-tube boiler developed as the third of the four major historical types of boilers: low- pressure tank or \\"haystack\\" boilers, flued boilers with one or two large flues, fire-tube boilers with many small tubes, and high-pressure water-tube boilers. Their advantage over flued boilers with a single large flue is that the many small tubes offer far greater heating surface area for the same overall boiler volume. The general construction is as a tank of water penetrated by tubes that carry the hot flue gases from the fire. The tank is usually cylindrical for the most part‚Äîbeing the strongest practical shape for a pressurized container‚Äîand this cylindrical tank may be either horizontal or vertical. This type of boiler was used on virtually all steam locomotives in the horizontal \\"locomotive\\" form. This has a cylindrical barrel containing the fire tubes, but also has an extension at one end to house the \\"firebox\\". This firebox has an open base to provide a large grate area and often extends beyond the cylindrical barrel to form a rectangular or tapered enclosure. The horizontal fire-tube boiler is also typical of marine applications, using the Scotch boiler; thus, these boilers are commonly referred to as \\"scotch-marine\\" or \\"marine\\" type boilers. Vertical boilers have also been built of the multiple fire-tube type, although these are comparatively rare; most vertical boilers were either flued, or with cross water-tubes.  Operation  Schematic diagram of a \\"locomotive\\" type fire-tube boiler In the locomotive- type boiler, fuel is burnt in a firebox to produce hot combustion gases. The firebox is surrounded by a cooling jacket of water connected to the long, cylindrical boiler shell. The hot gases are directed along a series of fire tubes, or flues, that penetrate the boiler and heat the water thereby generating saturated (\\"wet\\") steam. The steam rises to the highest point of the boiler, the steam dome, where it is collected. The dome is the site of the regulator that controls the exit of steam from the boiler. In the locomotive boiler, the saturated steam is very often passed into a superheater, back through the larger flues at the top of the boiler, to dry the steam and heat it to superheated steam. The superheated steam is directed to the steam engine's cylinders or very rarely to a turbine to produce mechanical work. Exhaust gases are fed out through a chimney, and may be used to pre-heat the feed water to increase the efficiency of the boiler. Draught for firetube boilers, particularly in marine applications, is usually provided by a tall smokestack. In all steam locomotives since Stephenson's Rocket, additional draught is supplied by directing exhaust steam from the cylinders into the smokestack through a blastpipe, to provide a partial vacuum. Modern industrial boilers use fans to provide forced or induced draughting of the boiler. Another major advance in the Rocket was large numbers of small-diameter firetubes (a multi-tubular boiler) instead of a single large flue. This greatly increased the surface area for heat transfer, allowing steam to be produced at a much higher rate. Without this, steam locomotives could never have developed effectively as powerful prime movers.  Types of fire-tube boiler  For more details on the related ancestor type, see Flued boilers. = Cornish boiler = The earliest form of fire-tube boiler was Richard Trevithick's \\"high-pressure\\" Cornish boiler. This is a long horizontal cylinder with a single large flue containing the fire. The fire itself was on an iron grating placed across this flue, with a shallow ashpan beneath to collect the non-combustible residue. Although considered as low-pressure (perhaps ) today, the use of a cylindrical boiler shell permitted a higher pressure than the earlier \\"haystack\\" boilers of Newcomen's day. As the furnace relied on natural draught (air flow), a tall chimney was required at the far end of the flue to encourage a good supply of air (oxygen) to the fire. For efficiency, the boiler was commonly encased beneath by a brick-built chamber. Flue gases were routed through this, outside the iron boiler shell, after passing through the fire-tube and so to a chimney that was now placed at the front face of the boiler. Lancashire boiler in Germany = Lancashire boiler = The Lancashire boiler is similar to the Cornish, but has two large flues containing the fires. It was the invention of William Fairbairn in 1844, from a theoretical consideration of the thermodynamics of more efficient boilers that led him to increase the furnace grate area relative to the volume of water. Later developments added Galloway tubes (after their inventor, patented in 1848), crosswise water tubes across the flue, thus increasing the heated surface area. As these are short tubes of large diameter and the boiler continues to use a relatively low pressure, this is still not considered to be a water-tube boiler. The tubes are tapered, simply to make their installation through the flue easier. Side-section of a Scotch marine boiler: the arrows show direction of flue gas flow; the combustion chamber is on the right, the smokebox on the left. = Scotch marine boiler = The Scotch marine boiler differs dramatically from its predecessors in using a large number of small- diameter tubes. This gives a far greater heating surface area for the volume and weight. The furnace remains a single large-diameter tube with the many small tubes arranged above it. They are connected together through a combustion chamber ‚Äì an enclosed volume contained entirely within the boiler shell ‚Äì so that the flow of flue gas through the firetubes is from back to front. An enclosed smokebox covering the front of these tubes leads upwards to the chimney or funnel. Typical Scotch boilers had a pair of furnaces, larger ones had three. Above this size, such as for large steam ships, it was more usual to install multiple boilers. = Locomotive boiler = A locomotive boiler has three main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical \\"boiler barrel\\" containing a large number of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. The boiler barrel contains larger flue-tubes to carry the superheater elements, where present. Forced draught is provided in the locomotive boiler by injecting exhausted steam back into the exhaust via a blast pipe in the smokebox. Locomotive-type boilers are also used in traction engines, steam rollers, portable engines and some other steam road vehicles. The inherent strength of the boiler means it is used as the basis for the vehicle: all the other components, including the wheels, are mounted on brackets attached to the boiler. It is rare to find superheaters designed into this type of boiler, and they are generally much smaller (and simpler) than railway locomotive types. The locomotive-type boiler is also a characteristic of the overtype steam wagon, the steam-powered fore-runner of the truck. In this case, however, heavy girder frames make up the load-bearing chassis of the vehicle, and the boiler is attached to this. ;Taper boiler Certain railway locomotive boilers are tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end. This reduces weight and improves water circulation. Many later Great Western Railway and London, Midland and Scottish Railway locomotives were designed or modified to take taper boilers. = Vertical fire-tube boiler = A vertical fire-tube boiler (VFT), colloquially known as the \\"vertical boiler\\", has a vertical cylindrical shell, containing several vertical flue tubes. = Horizontal return tubular boiler = Horizontal Return Tubular boilers from the Staatsbad Bad Steben GmbH Horizontal return tubular boiler (HRT) has a horizontal cylindrical shell, containing several horizontal flue tubes, with the fire located directly below the boiler's shell, usually within a brickwork setting = Admiralty-type direct tube boiler = Extensively used by Britain, before and in the early days of ironclads, the only protected place was below the waterline, sometimes under an armoured deck, so to fit below short decks, the tubes were not led back above the furnace but continued straight from it with keeping the combustion chamber in between the two. Hence the name, and considerably reduced diameter, compared to the ubiquitous Scotch or return tube boiler. It was not a great success and its use was being abandoned after the introduction of stronger side armouring ‚Äì ‚Äúthe furnace crowns, being very near the water-level, are much more liable to over-heating. Further, on account of the length of the boiler, for an equal angle of inclination, the effect on the water-level is much greater. Finally, the unequal expansion of the various parts of the boiler is more pronounced, especially at the top and bottom, due to the increased ratio between the length and the diameter of the boiler; the local strains are also more severe on account of the comparatively feeble circulation in long and low boilers.‚Äù All these also resulted in a shorter life. Also, the same length of a combustion chamber was much less effective on a direct tube than on a return tube boiler, at least without baffling.Louis-√âmile Bertin: Marine boilers‚Äîtheir construction and working, dealing more especially with tubulous boilers ‚Äì Ed. 2 (1906), tr. and ed. by Leslie S. Robertson. Freely available on the Internet Archive https://archive.org/details/marineboilersthe00bertuoft. pages 233, 235 and others = Immersion fired boiler = The immersion fired boiler is a single- pass fire-tube boiler that was developed by Sellers Engineering in the 1940s. It has only firetubes, functioning as a furnace and combustion chamber also, with multiple burner nozzles injecting premixed air and natural gas under pressure. It claims reduced thermal stresses, and lacks refractory brickwork completely due to its construction.  Variations  = Water tubes = Fire- tube boilers sometimes have water-tubes as well, to increase the heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across the diameter of the flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the fire tubes increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower fire tubes. To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water from the bottom of the boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature. Another technique for increasing the heating surface is to include internal rifling inside the boiler tubes (also known as Serve tubes). Not all shell boilers raise steam; some are designed specifically for heating pressurised water. = Reverse flame = In homage to the Lancashire design, modern shell boilers can come with a twin furnace design. A more recent development has been the reverse flame design where the burner fires into a blind furnace and the combustion gasses double back on themselves. This results in a more compact design and less pipework. = Package boiler = The term \\"package\\" boiler evolved in the early- to mid-20th century; it is used to describe residential heating boilers delivered to the installation site with all insulation, electrical panels, valves, gauges, and fuel burners already assembled by the manufacturer. Other delivery methods more closely resemble prior practice from the coal burning era, when other components were added on-site to either a pre-assembled pressure vessel, or to a \\"knock-down\\" boiler, where the pressure vessel is delivered as a set of castings to be assembled on-site. As a general rule, factory assembly is much more cost-effective and the packaged boiler is the preferred option for domestic use. Part-assembled deliveries are only used when necessary because of access limitations - e.g. when the only access to a basement installation site is down a narrow flight of stairs. Kewanee Gas- Fired Packaged Fire-Tube Boiler from 1974 rated at 25 horsepower  Safety considerations  Because the fire-flume boiler itself is the pressure vessel, it requires a number of safety features to prevent mechanical failure. Boiler explosion, which is a type of BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion), can be devastating. * Safety valves release steam before a dangerous pressure can be built up * Fusible plugs over the firebox melt at a temperature lower than that of the firebox plates, thereby warning the operators by the noisy escape of steam if the water level is too low to cool the firebox crown safely. * Stays, or ties, physically link the firebox and boiler casing, preventing them from warping. Since any corrosion is hidden, the stays may have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which leak before they become unsafe. The fire-tube type boiler that was used in the Stanley Steamer automobile had several hundred tubes which were weaker than the outer shell of the boiler, making an explosion virtually impossible as the tubes would fail and leak long before the boiler exploded. In nearly 100 years since the Stanleys were first produced, no Stanley boiler has ever exploded.  Economics and efficiencies  = Excessive cycling = Each time a boiler cycles off and on, it can lose efficiency. When the fire starts combustion efficiency is usually lower until steady state conditions prevail. When the fire stops the warm chimney continues to draw additional air from the interior space until it cools. Excessive cycling can be minimized * Modulating boilers can run longer (at firing rates that match the loads) than the non- modulating boilers (which operate at the full firing rate). ** By using condensing modulating boilers. ** By using non-condensing modulating boiler. ** By setting the controls (thermostats or controller with temperature sensors) with greater temperature differentials between STOP and START. * At Non-Condensing Boilers make provisions so that minimum return water temperature of to to the boiler to avoid fireside corrosion. ** By setting the MINIMUM OFF times at 8 to 15 minutes. For comfort heating loads, short time intervals do not usually trigger occupant complaints. Common provisions are to provide a primary piping loop with pump(s) and a secondary piping loop with pump(s); and either a variable speed controlled pump to transfer water from the primary loop to the secondary loop, or a 3-way valve to divert water from the secondary loop to the primary loop.  Fireside corrosion in non- condensing boilers  A minimum return water temperature of to to the boiler, depending on the specific design, is used to avoid condensing water vapor from the flue gas and dissolving CO2 and SO2 from the flue gasses forming carbolic and sulfuric acid, a corrosive fluid that damages the heat exchanger. = Condensing boilers = Condensing boilers can be 2% or more efficient at lower firing rates by extracting the heat of vaporization from the water vapor in the flue gases. The efficiency increase depends on the fuel and the available energy to be recovered as a fraction of the total. Methane flue gas containing more available energy to recover than propane or fuel oil relatively less. The condensed water is corrosive due to dissolved carbon dioxide and sulfur oxides from the flue and must be neutralized before disposal. Condensing boilers have a higher seasonal efficiency, typically 84% to 92%, than non-condensing boilers typically 70% to 75%. The seasonal efficiency is an overall efficiency of the boiler over the entire heating season as opposed to the combustion efficiency which is the boiler's efficiency when actively fired, which excludes standing losses. The higher seasonal efficiency is partly because the lower boiler temperature used to condense the flue gas reduces standing losses during the off cycle. The lower boiler temperature precludes a condensing steam boiler and requires lower radiator temperatures in water systems. The higher efficiency of operating in the condensing region isn't always available. To produce satisfactory domestic hot water frequently requires boiler water temperature higher than allows effective condensing on the heat exchanger surface. During cold weather the building's radiator surface area is usually not large enough to deliver enough heat at low boiler temperatures so the boiler's control raises the boiler temperature as required to meet heating demand. These two factors account for most of the variability of the efficiency gains experienced at different installations.  Maintenance  An intensive schedule of maintenance is needed to keep a high pressure railway steam boiler in safe condition. = Daily inspection = The tube plates, the fusible plug and the heads of the firebox stays should be checked for leaks. The correct operation of the boiler fittings, especially the water gauges and water feed mechanisms, should be confirmed. Steam pressure should be raised to the level at which the safety valves lift and compared with the indication of the pressure gauge. = Washout = Cutaway of locomotive boiler. Note the narrow water spaces around the firebox and the \\"mudhole\\" for access to the crown sheet: these areas require special attention during washout The working life of a locomotive boiler is considerably extended if it is spared from a constant cycle of cooling and heating. Historically, a locomotive would be kept ‚Äúin steam‚Äù continuously for a period of about eight to ten days, and then allowed to cool sufficiently for a hot-water boiler washout. The schedule for express engines was based on mileage.Bell, A M (1957): Locomotives, seventh edition, Virtue and Company, London. Today's preserved locomotives are not usually kept continuously in steam and the recommended washout interval is now fifteen to thirty days, but anything up to 180 days is possible.Unknown authors (2005):The management of steam locomotive boilers. Health and Safety Executive, Sudbury, Suffolk, England. The process starts with a ‚Äúblowdown‚Äù while some pressure remains in the boiler, then the draining away of all the boiler water through the ‚Äúmudholes‚Äù at the base of the firebox and the removal of all the ‚Äúwashout plugs‚Äù. Scale is then jetted or scraped from the interior surfaces using a high-pressure water jet and rods of soft metal, such as copper. Areas particularly susceptible to scale buildup, such as the firebox crown and narrow water spaces around the firebox, are given special attention. The inside of the boiler is inspected by sighting through the plug holes, with a particular check paid to the integrity of the firetubes, firebox crown and stays and absence of pitting or cracking of the boiler plates. The gauge glass cocks and tubes and fusible plug should be cleared of scale; if the core of the fusible plug shows signs of calcination the item should be replaced. On reassembly care should be taken that the threaded plugs are replaced in their original holes: the tapers can vary as a result of rethreading. The mudhole door gaskets, if of asbestos, should be renewed but those made of lead may be reused; special instructions are in force for the disposal of these harmful materials.. Many boilers today make use of high temperature synthetics for the gaskets for both working environments and in preservation service as these materials are safer than the historic options. At large maintenance facilities the boiler would have been both washed and refilled with very hot water from an external supply to bring the locomotive back to service more quickly. = Periodic examination = Typically an annual inspection, this would require the removal and check of external fittings, such as the injectors, safety valves and pressure gauge. High-pressure copper pipework can suffer from work hardening in use and become dangerously brittle: it may be necessary to treat these by annealing before refitting. A hydraulic pressure test on the boiler and pipework may also be called for. = General overhaul = In the UK the specified maximum interval between full overhauls is ten years. To enable a full inspection the boiler is lifted from the locomotive frame and the lagging removed. All firetubes are removed for checking or replacement. All fittings are removed for overhaul. Before returning to use a qualified examiner will check the boiler's fitness for service and issue a safety certificate valid for ten years.

Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which heats water in the steam-generating tubes. In smaller boilers, additional generating tubes are separate in the furnace, while larger utility boilers rely on the water-filled tubes that make up the walls of the furnace to generate steam. The heated water then rises into the steam drum. Here, saturated steam is drawn off the top of the drum. In some services, the steam will reenter the furnace through a superheater to become superheated. Superheated steam is defined as steam that is heated above the boiling point at a given pressure. Superheated steam is a dry gas and therefore used to drive turbines, since water droplets can severely damage turbine blades. Cool water at the bottom of the steam drum returns to the feedwater drum via large-bore 'downcomer tubes', where it pre-heats the feedwater supply. (In large utility boilers, the feedwater is supplied to the steam drum and the downcomers supply water to the bottom of the waterwalls). To increase economy of the boiler, exhaust gases are also used to pre-heat the air blown into the furnace and warm the feedwater supply. Such watertube boilers in thermal power stations are also called steam generating units. The older fire-tube boiler design, in which the water surrounds the heat source and gases from combustion pass through tubes within the water space, is a much weaker structure and is rarely used for pressures above . A significant advantage of the watertube boiler is that there is less chance of a catastrophic failure: there is not a large volume of water in the boiler nor are there large mechanical elements subject to failure. A water tube boiler was patented by Blakey of England in 1766 and was made by Dallery of France in 1780.  Applications  \\"The ability of watertube boilers to generate superheated steam makes these boilers particularly attractive in applications that require dry, high-pressure, high-energy steam, including steam turbine power generation\\". Owing to their superb working properties, the use of watertube boilers is highly preferred in the following major areas: * Variety of process applications in industries * Chemical processing divisions * Pulp and Paper manufacturing plants * Refining units Besides, they are frequently employed in power generation plants where large quantities of steam (ranging up to 500 kg/s) having high pressures i.e. approximately and high temperatures reaching up to 550 ¬∞C are generally required. For example, the Ivanpah solar- power station uses two Rentech Type-D watertube boilers. = Stationary = Modern boilers for power generation are almost entirely water-tube designs, owing to their ability to operate at higher pressures. Where process steam is required for heating or as a chemical component, then there is still a small niche for fire-tube boilers. = Marine = Their ability to work at higher pressures has led to marine boilers being almost entirely water-tube. This change began around 1900, and traced the adoption of turbines for propulsion rather than reciprocating (i.e. piston) engines ‚Äì although watertube boilers were also used with reciprocating engines. = Railway = There has been no significant adoption of water-tube boilers for railway locomotives. A handful of experimental designs were produced, but none of these were successful or led to their widespread use. Most water-tube railway locomotives, especially in Europe, used the Schmidt system. Most were compounds, and a few uniflows. The Norfolk and Western Railway's Jawn Henry was an exception, as it used a steam turbine combined with an electric transmission. * LMS 6399 Fury : Rebuilt completely after a fatal accident * LNER 10000 \\"Hush hush\\" : Using a Yarrow boiler, rather than Schmidt. Never successful and re-boilered with a conventional boiler.  Hybrids  A slightly more successful adoption was the use of hybrid water-tube / fire-tube systems. As the hottest part of a locomotive boiler is the firebox, it was an effective design to use a water- tube design here and a conventional fire-tube boiler as an economiser (i.e. pre-heater) in the usual position. One famous example of this was the USA Baldwin 4-10-2 No. 60000, built in 1926. Operating as a compound at a boiler pressure of it covered over successfully. After a year though, it became clear that any economies were overwhelmed by the extra costs and it was retired to become a stationary plant. A series of twelve experimental locomotives were constructed at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Mt. Clare shops under the supervision of George H. Emerson, but none of them was replicated in any numbers.See chapter on \\"Experimentals\\" in Brotan boiler The only railway use of water-tube boilers in any numbers was the Brotan boiler, invented in Austria in 1902 by Johann Brotan and found in rare examples throughout Europe. Hungary, though, was a keen user and had around 1,000 of them. Like the Baldwin, this combined a water-tube firebox with a fire-tube barrel. The original characteristic of the Brotan was a long steam drum running above the main barrel, making it resemble a Flaman boiler in appearance. = Road = While the traction engine was usually built using its locomotive boiler as its frame, other types of steam road vehicles such as lorries and cars have used a wide range of different boiler types. Road transport pioneers Goldsworthy Gurney and Walter Hancock both used water-tube boilers in their steam carriages around 1830. Most undertype wagons used water-tube boilers. Many manufacturers used variants of the vertical cross-tube boiler, including Atkinson, Clayton, Garrett and Sentinel. Other types include the Clarkson 'thimble tube' and the Foden O-type wagon's pistol-shaped boiler. Steam fire- engine makers such as Merryweather usually used water-tube boilers for their rapid steam-raising capacity. Many steam cars used water-tube boilers, and the Bolsover Express company even made a water-tube replacement for the Stanley Steamer fire-tube boiler.  Design variations  = D-type Boiler = The 'D-type' is the most common type of small- to medium-sized boilers, similar to the one shown in the schematic diagram. It is used in both stationary and marine applications. It consists of a large steam drum vertically connected to a smaller water drum (a.k.a. \\"mud drum\\") via multiple steam-generating tubes. These are surrounded by walls made up of larger water-filled tubes, which make up the furnace. =M-Type Boilers = The M-Type boilers were used in many US World War II warships including hundreds of Fletcher-class destroyers. Three sets of tubes form the shape of an M, and create a separately fired superheater that allows better superheat temperature control. In addition to the mud drum shown on a D-type boiler, an M-Type has a water-screen header and a waterwall header at the bottom of the two additional rows of vertical tubes and downcomers. = Low Water Content = The 'Low Water Content' boiler has a lower and upper header connected by watertubes that are directly impinged upon from the burner. This is a \\"furnace-less\\" boiler that can generate steam and react quickly to changes in load. = Babcock & Wilcox boiler = Babcock & Wilcox boiler Designed by the American firm of Babcock & Wilcox, this type has a single drum, with feedwater drawn from the bottom of the drum into a header that supplies inclined water-tubes. The watertubes supply steam back into the top of the drum. Furnaces are located below the tubes and drum. This type of boiler was used by the Royal Navy's Leander-class frigates. *Foster Wheeler *Combustion Engineering = Stirling boiler = The Stirling boiler has near- vertical, almost-straight watertubes that zig-zag between a number of steam and water drums. Usually there are three banks of tubes in a \\"four drum\\" layout, but certain applications use variations designed with a different number of drums and banks. They are mainly used as stationary boilers, owing to their large size, although the large grate area does also encourage their ability to burn a wide range of fuels. Originally coal-fired in power stations, they also became widespread in industries that produced combustible waste and required process steam. Paper pulp mills could burn waste bark, sugar refineries their bagasse waste. It is a horizontal type of boiler. = Yarrow = End-view of a Yarrow boiler Named after its designers, the then Poplar-based Yarrow Shipbuilders, this type of three-drum boiler has three drums in a delta formation connected by watertubes. The drums are linked by straight watertubes, allowing easy tube-cleaning. This does, however, mean that the tubes enter the drums at varying angles, a more difficult joint to caulk. Outside the firebox, a pair of 'cold-leg' pipes between each drum act as 'downcomers'. Due to its three drums, the Yarrow boiler has a greater water capacity. Hence, this type is usually used in older marine boiler applications. Its compact size made it attractive for use in transportable power generation units during World War II. In order to make it transportable, the boiler and its auxiliary equipment (fuel oil heating, pumping units, fans etc.), turbines, and condensers were mounted on wagons to be transported by rail. = White-Forster = The White-Forster type is similar to the Yarrow, but with tubes that are gradually curved. This makes their entry into the drums perpendicular, thus simpler to make a reliable seal. = Thornycroft = End-view of a Thornycroft boiler Designed by the shipbuilder John I. Thornycroft & Company, the Thornycroft type features a single steam drum with two sets of watertubes either side of the furnace. These tubes, especially the central set, have sharp curves. Apart from obvious difficulties in cleaning them, this may also give rise to bending forces as the tubes warm up, tending to pull them loose from the tubeplate and creating a leak. There are two furnaces, venting into a common exhaust, giving the boiler a wide base tapering profile. = Forced circulation boiler = In a forced circulation boiler, a pump is added to speed up the flow of water through the tubes. = Other types = * O-type boiler * A-type boiler * Flex-tube boiler * M-Type Control superheater  See also  * Three-drum boiler * Clarkson thimble tube boiler * Corner tube Boiler * Internally rifled boiler tubes (also known as Serve tubes)  References   External links  *Robertson, Leslie Stephen Water-tube boilers; based on a short course of lectures delivered at University college, London (1901) from the Internet Archive Category:Boilers ","title":"Water-tube boiler"},{"id":"1164768","text":"Three layers of subsurface loam; surface layer is dark brown fine sandy loam, subsurface layer is pale brown fine sandy loam, subsoil is red clay loam and sandy clay loam.

Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The soil's texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water, are crucial. Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties. Bricks made of loam, mud, sand, and water, with an added binding material such as rice husks or straw, have been used in construction since ancient times. Classifications Loam soils can be classified into more specific subtypes. Some examples are sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. Different soil phases have some variation in characteristics like stoniness and erosion that are too minor to effect the native vegetative growth but can be significant for crop cultivation.United States Department of Agriculture Soil Survey, 1943 Use in farming Fine, loam-rich field ideal for farming vegetables in the UK Loam is considered ideal for gardening and agricultural uses because it retains nutrients well and retains water while still allowing excess water to drain away.B.

It was directed by Lewis Gilbert and is based on the 1953 novel by John Harris, about a North Sea rescue during the Second World War. The musical soundtrack is by composer Malcolm Arnold. The film title is the motto of the Royal Air Force's Air Sea Rescue Service. Plot It is the autumn of 1944. Allied armies are sweeping through France towards Germany. A British Lockheed Hudson has been damaged in aerial combat with a German Messerschmitt, with both aircraft ditching in the North Sea, twenty miles off the Dutch coast. The four crew from the British aircraft are unable to send a complete mayday alert, although a signal fragment reaches England. Among them is Air Commodore Waltby (Michael Redgrave) who has a briefcase containing secret German plans related to rocketry. Flight Sergeant Mackay (Dirk Bogarde) assumes a leading role in the rescue dinghy, tying everyone together to prevent anyone falling overboard, and sharing his boots with the pilot despite the cold. As the weather closes in and a freezing cold night descends, aircraft suspend their search, leaving the now waterlogged dinghy to face the sea alone. Cryptically, Waltby orders the crew members that if he dies, they must get the briefcase to London or throw it overboard should they face capture. An RAF Air Sea Rescue sea launch is deployed to the search. Commanded by Flying Officer Treherne (Anthony Steel), Launch 2561, or \\"Sixty One\\" in radio signals, struggles against the bad weather, mechanical problems and a fire in the galley. Second in command, Flight Sergeant Singsby (Nigel Patrick) dominates the crew, playing a benevolent but demanding hand with the questionable seamanship of junior ranks. On the second day, updated intelligence about the dinghy's likely location is received from the downed German Messerschmitt pilot, who the RAF has since rescued. RAF Air Sea Rescue is now aware the dinghy has drifted inshore, far from its ditching point. As the weather clears, \\"Sixty One\\" sights the dinghy and approaches for rescue, negotiating fire from enemy shore batteries and a mine field. Launch 2561 safely returns to England where the briefcase with secret documents is delivered. An injured Flying Officer Treherne and Flight Sergeant Mackay are applauded by senior officers.

Irishman Michael Gannon was innkeeper at Cooks River in the 1840s. He acquired land in the area, part of which became known as ‚ÄòGannons Forest‚Äô which later was the centre of Hurstville. By 1851 it was estimated that 50 to 100 carts of timber and lime crossed the Cooks River daily. St George Parish was one of the original parishes within Cumberland County. There were eight other parishes named after saints; but St George and St James are the only ones which are widely known today. A map of the parish revealed that the land was cut into areas ranging from 30 to and a few large land grants of . The recipients were William Packer, Josh Thorp, James Oatley, Hannah Laycock, F. W. Unwin, Reuben and David Hannam, Patrick Moore, J. Beehag, John Porter and the larger grants were James Chandler and John and Robert Townson. The regional identity was reinforced by the creation in 1949 of a federal electorate, the Division of St George, in the area. The Division was abolished in 1993. The area's identity is maintained mostly through the St George Illawarra Dragons who play in the National Rugby League, and the St. George Bank.

It is used mainly to prepare the muscles before the person training engages in stronger physical activity. In shadowboxing, only one person is required to participate; the participant throws punches at no one in particular. Muhammad Ali once performed a now famous shadowboxing routine next to Howard Cosell for ABC's Wide World of Sports television cameras. Black Nova Scotian boxer George Dixon is widely credited for developing the technique.  Details  Most boxing trainers prefer that their fighters do their shadow boxing before engaging in any other daily exercise routines. The main purpose of this exercise, apart from getting the muscles ready for another activity, is usually to maintain a fighter's rhythm and show the fighter how they would look at that stage of training against a certain opponent. This could be important as fighters envision themselves facing their immediate future opponents: it usually gives fighters an idea of what is, and what is not, to be fixed. Fighters may want to do some shadowboxing of their own after their daily routines are over, either inside a boxing gym's ring, or wherever they please to at home without having to look directly at a mirror. Shadowboxing is not, of course, limited to boxers and fighters. Many fighters from other striking based martial arts also use the exercise as part of their daily routines and aside from punches and perhaps dependent upon fighting style they will use kicks, knees, elbows, or even throws. Bruce Lee was often seen practicing his kicks in front of a mirror on his films, and he incorporated other concepts from boxing into his Jeet Kune Do style such as footwork and live sparring. Shadowboxing with swords and other weapons, referred to as a floryshe, is a major training tool among Historical European Martial Arts groups such as the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts and the HEMA Alliance. Fighters of other more grappling based martial arts also shadowbox as part of their daily training regimen. Freestyle wrestlers also practice many drills simulating specific wrestling moves without the aid of a partner such as shooting, sprawling, hip switches and bridging. =Styles= The long method involves a shuffle of the feet that rocks the body back and forth. This is a style favored by fighters with long reach, who use more of jabs and straight shots. The short method sees the fighter move his head and body to the left and right, constantly slipping punches and moving in for closer body shots. Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson are among the best examples of fighters who use this method.  Psychology  The term shadowboxing is also used in psychology, referring to the process of overcoming a negative self-image which, for example, prevents one from achieving success.

It was typed by Kathleen Kenyon during her archaeological excavations at Jericho in the West Bank. Like the earlier PPNA people, the PPNB culture developed from the Mesolithic Natufian culture. However, it shows evidence of a northerly origin, possibly indicating an influx from the region of northeastern Anatolia. Lifestyle Cultural tendencies of this period differ from that of the earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period in that people living during this period began to depend more heavily upon domesticated animals to supplement their earlier mixed agrarian and hunter- gatherer diet. In addition, the flint tool kit of the period is new and quite disparate from that of the earlier period. One of its major elements is the naviform core. This is the first period in which architectural styles of the southern Levant became primarily rectilinear; earlier typical dwellings were circular, elliptical and occasionally even octagonal. Pyrotechnology, the expanding capability to control fire, was highly developed in this period. During this period, one of the main features of houses is a thick layer of white clay plaster flooring, highly polished and made of lime produced from limestone. Plastered skulls in situ at Yiftahel. It is believed that the use of clay plaster for floor and wall coverings during PPNB led to the discovery of pottery.Amihai Mazar (1992). Archaeology of the Land of the Bible: 10,000 ‚Äì 586 BCE, Doubleday: New York, p. 45. The earliest proto-pottery was White Ware vessels, made from lime and gray ash, built up around baskets before firing, for several centuries around 7000 BCE at sites such as Tell Neba'a Faour (Beqaa Valley).Chris Scarre. Timeline of the Ancient World, p. 77. Sites from this period found in the Levant utilizing rectangular floor plans and plastered floor techniques were found at Ain Ghazal, Yiftahel (western Galilee), and Abu Hureyra (Upper Euphrates). The period is dated to between c. 10,700 and c. 8,000 BP or 7000‚Äì6000 BCE. Plastered human skulls were reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient Levant between 9000 and 6000 BC in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the Middle East and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their ancestors below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of portraiture in the history of art. Society Reconstitution of housing in A≈üƒ±klƒ± H√∂y√ºk, modern Turkey. Danielle Stordeur's recent work at Tell Aswad, a large agricultural village between Mount Hermon and Damascus could not validate Henri de Contenson's earlier suggestion of a PPNA Aswadian culture. Instead, they found evidence of a fully established PPNB culture at 8700 BC at Aswad, pushing back the period's generally accepted start date by 1,200 years. Similar sites to Tell Aswad in the Damascus Basin of the same age were found at Tell Ramad and Tell Ghoraif√©. How a PPNB culture could spring up in this location, practicing domesticated farming from 8700 BC has been the subject of speculation. Whether it created its own culture or imported traditions from the North East or Southern Levant has been considered an important question for a site that poses a problem for the scientific community.Helmer D. ; Gourichon L., Premi√®res donn√©es sur les modalit√©s de subsistance dans les niveaux r√©cents de Tell Aswad (Damasc√®ne, Syrie) ‚Äì fouilles 2001-2005., 2008.Helmer D. et Gourichon L., Premi√®res donn√©es sur les modalit√©s de subsistances dans les niveaux r√©cents (PPNB moyen √† N√©olithique √† Poterie) de Tell Aswad en Damasc√®ne (Syrie), Fouilles 2001-2005, in Vila E. et Gourichon L.

Juris Zarins has proposed that a Circum Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex developed in the period from the climatic crisis of 6200 BCE, partly as a result of an increasing emphasis in PPNB cultures upon animal domesticates, and a fusion with Harifian hunter gatherers in Southern Palestine, with affiliate connections with the cultures of Fayyum and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Cultures practicing this lifestyle spread down the Red Sea shoreline and moved east from Syria into southern Iraq.Zarins, Juris (1992) \\"Pastoral Nomadism in Arabia: Ethnoarchaeology and the Archaeological Record,\\" in O. Bar-Yosef and A. Khazanov, eds. \\"Pastoralism in the Levant\\" The culture disappeared during the 8.2 kiloyear event, a term that climatologists have adopted for a sudden decrease in global temperatures that occurred approximately 8,200 years before the present, or c. 6200 BCE, and which lasted for the next two to four centuries. In the following Munhatta and Yarmukian post-pottery Neolithic cultures that succeeded it, rapid cultural development continues, although PPNB culture continued in the Amuq valley, where it influenced the later development of the Ghassulian culture. Artifacts Around 8000 BCE, before the invention of pottery, several early settlements became experts in crafting beautiful and highly sophisticated containers from stone, using materials such as alabaster or granite, and employing sand to shape and polish. Artisans used the veins in the material to maximum visual effect. Such object have been found in abundance on the upper Euphrates river, in what is today eastern Syria, especially at the site of Bouqras. These form the early stages of the development of the Art of Mesopotamia. File:Jar MET VS1985 356 16.jpgJar in calcite alabaster, Syria, late 8th millennium BCE.

Diffusion =Carbon 14 Dating= Map of the spread of Neolithic farming cultures from the Near-East to Europe, with dates in year BCE. The spread of the Neolithic in Europe was first studied quantitatively in the 1970s, when a sufficient number of 14C age determinations for early Neolithic sites had become available. Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza discovered a linear relationship between the age of an Early Neolithic site and its distance from the conventional source in the Near East (Jericho), thus demonstrating that, on average, the Neolithic spread at a constant speed of about 1 km/yr. More recent studies confirm these results and yield the speed of 0.6‚Äì1.3 km/yr at 95% confidence level.Original text from 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. =Analysis of mitochondrial DNA= Since the original human expansions out of Africa 200,000 years ago, different prehistoric and historic migration events have taken place in Europe. Considering that the movement of the people implies a consequent movement of their genes, it is possible to estimate the impact of these migrations through the genetic analysis of human populations. Agricultural and husbandry practices originated 10,000 years ago in a region of the Near East known as the Fertile Crescent. According to the archaeological record this phenomenon, known as ‚ÄúNeolithic‚Äù, rapidly expanded from these territories into Europe. However, whether this diffusion was accompanied or not by human migrations is greatly debated. Mitochondrial DNA ‚Äì a type of maternally inherited DNA located in the cell cytoplasm- was recovered from the remains of Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farmers in the Near East and then compared to available data from other Neolithic populations in Europe and also to modern populations from South Eastern Europe and the Near East. The obtained results show that substantial human migrations were involved in the Neolithic spread and suggest that the first Neolithic farmers entered Europe following a maritime route through Cyprus and the Aegean Islands.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License File:Modern distribution of the haplotypes of PPNB farmers.jpgModern distribution of the haplotypes of PPNB farmers File:Genetic distance between PPNB farmers and modern populations.jpgGenetic distance between PPNB farmers and modern populations Relative chronology See also *Plastered Human Skull *Pre-Pottery Neolithic A preceded PPNB *Pre- history of the Southern Levant *Prehistory of Upper Mesopotamia *History of pottery in the Southern Levant *Holocene climatic optimum References Category:Neolithic cultures of Asia Category:Archaeological cultures of the Near East Category:9th millennium BC ","title":"Pre-Pottery Neolithic B"},{"id":"1164793","title":"Moscow Time"},{"id":"1164794","text":"Microburin A microburin is a characteristic waste product from manufacture of lithic tools ‚Äî sometimes confused with an authentic burin ‚Äî which is characteristic of the Mesolithic, but which has been recorded from the end of the Upper Paleolithic until the Calcolithic. (pages 127 y 272) This type of lithic artifact was first named by Henri Breuil who defined it as \\"a type of angular, smooth, with a terminal retouch in the form of a small notch\\". Breuil initially thought that the microburins had a functional use as a type of microlithic burin. However, he later came to realize that the manufacturing technique was different from that of the burin and that they could be waste products from the manufacture of microliths, but they may have occasionally been reused for a useful purpose. A microburin is a fragment of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face the beginnings of a notch terminating in an oblique flection (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side) that ends in a very acute trihedral apex. As stated earlier, it was thought that microburins were functional microliths, but carving experiments, along with the reassembly of pieces with perfectly aligned edges have demonstrated that they were a characteristic waste of a technique called microburin technique, or more correctly microburin blow technique, following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of saharan sites. Jacques Tixier noted that none of the pieces showed traces of intentional use, this finding confirms the finding of the analysis of European pieces.

The idea of a Holy Guardian Angel is central to the book The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra Melin the Mage by Abraham of Worms, a German Cabalist who wrote the book on ceremonial magick during the 15th century and which was later translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He elaborated on this earlier work, giving it extensive magical notes, but the original concept goes back to the Zoroastrian Arda Frava≈° ('Holy Guardian Angels'). In Mathers' publication of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, he writes: :\\"If thou shalt perfectly observe these rules, all the following Symbols and an infinitude of others will be granted unto thee by thy Holy Guardian Angel; thou thus living for the Honour and Glory of the True and only God, for thine own good, and that of thy neighbour. Let the Fear of God be ever before the eyes and the heart of him who shall possess this Divine Wisdom and Sacred Magic.\\"MacGregor Mathers, S. L.. The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. Book Tree. Later, author and occultist Aleister Crowley popularized the term within his religious and philosophical system of Thelema. Aleister Crowley's teachings Within the system of the magical Order A‚à¥A‚à¥ founded by Aleister Crowley, one of the two most important goals is to consciously connect with one‚Äôs Holy Guardian Angel, representative of one's truest divine nature: a process termed ‚ÄúKnowledge and Conversation.‚Äù :It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step‚Äîcrossing of the Abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.Crowley, Magic Without Tears, Ch.83 In some branches of occultism, the term is so widely known that HGA has become a common abbreviation even in non-English-speaking countries. Crowley seems to consider it equivalent to the Genius of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Augoeides of Iamblichus, the Atman of Hinduism, and the Daemon of the ancient Greeks. He borrowed the term from the Grimoire The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. = Methods of achieving knowledge and conversation = Crowley said that the Abramelin procedure was not the only way to achieve success in this endeavour: :It is impossible to lay down precise rules by which a man may attain to the knowledge and conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel; for that is the particular secret of each one of us; a secret not to be told or even divined by any other, whatever his grade. It is the Holy of Holies, whereof each man is his own High Priest, and none knoweth the Name of his brother's God, or the Rite that invokes Him.Book 4, \\"One Star in Sight\\" Since the operation described in Abramelin is so complex and requires time and resources not available to most people, Crowley wanted to provide a more accessible method. While at the Abbey of Thelema in Italy, he wrote Liber SamekhCrowley, Aleister. Liber Samekh. based on the Bornless Ritual, a ritual designed as an example of how one may attain the Knowledge and Conversation with one‚Äôs Holy Guardian Angel. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: ‚ÄúINVOKE OFTEN.‚Äù Crowley also explains, in more detail, the general mystical process of the ritual: :The Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul. :The effect of the Ritual has been :# to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him; :# to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths; :# to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anaesthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisection, just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen out the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire; :# to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; and :# to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes Him. :The method of the Ritual is thus manifold. Another detailed description of the general operation is given in The Vision and the Voice in the eighth Aethyr and is also described in Liber 8.Crowley, Aleister. Liber 8. = Variations in Crowley's teachings = Crowley only states that the Holy Guardian Angel is the 'silent self' in his early life. In his late sixties, when composing Magick Without Tears, he states something very different. According to Crowley's later definition, the Holy Guardian Angel is not one's 'self', but an independent and discrete being, who may have been a human like oneself at one stage: :Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel; and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent on one particular element for their existence. They are microcosms in exactly the same sense as men and women are. They are individuals who have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves... I believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order. He is something more than a man, possibly a being who has already passed through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship with his client is that of friendship, of community, of brotherhood, or Fatherhood. He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere abstraction from yourself; and that is why I have insisted rather heavily that the term 'Higher Self' implies a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion.\\"Crowley, Magick Without Tears The idea that the HGA is an independent, spiritual being, rather than a manifestation of the Self, has led to uneasiness in some circles that the doctrine is a disguised form of diabolism.  Peter Carroll's teachings An occult writer, Peter Carroll split the concept in two and speaks of two \\"Holy Guardian Angels\\". According to his work Liber Null and Psychonaut, one is the Augoeides,Caroll, Peter J. Liber Null and Psychonaut. pp. 49-51 a projected image of whatever the magician strives for, and the other is quantum uncertainty, which ultimately determines the acts of the magician and is a spark of the only true creative force, the chaos of Chaos magic. C.F. Russell's teachings American author C.F. Russell was the founder of an occult group called the G.B.G. The G.B.G. taught the use of \\"Dianism\\", a sex magick ritual in which a participant is to regard their partner as a representation of their Holy Guardian Angel.  Enochian teachings  The Enochian system of 16th Century occultist Dr. John Dee offers a concept similar to Crowley's later teachings with regard to the Holy Guardian Angel. It is more in concord with traditional teachings of the HGA as a messenger of God and one of His angels (critics of Crowley's system said it was open to the interpretation of the HGA being either a fallen angel (demon) or a lost, or damned, human soul). In this dialog between Dee and the angel Jubanladace on p. 18, Cotton Appendix XLVI 1, the angel says the following: > Dee: If I should not offend you, I would gladly know of what order you are > or how your state is in respect of Michael, Gabriel, Raphael or Uriel. > Jubanladace: Unto men, according unto their deserts, and the first > excellency of their soul, God hath appointed a good Governor or Angel, from > among the orders of those that are blessed. For every soul that is good, is > not of one and the self same dignification. Therefore according to his > excellency we are appointed as Ministers from that order, whereunto his > excellency accordeth: to the intent that he may be brought, at last, to > supply those places which were glorified by a former: and also to the > intent, that the Prince of darkness might be counterposed in God's > justice.Now in various collections of the British Library.

Polarforschung. 80(3):141‚Äì159. Ice sheet formed in connection to the uplift of the West Greenland and East Greenland uplands. The Western and Eastern Greenland mountains constitute passive continental margins that were uplifted in two phases, 10 and 5 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. Computer modelling shows that the uplift would have enabled glaciation by producing increased orographic precipitation and cooling the surface temperatures. The oldest known ice in the current ice sheet is as much as 1,000,000 years old. The weight of the ice has depressed the central area of Greenland; the bedrock surface is near sea level over most of the interior of Greenland, but mountains occur around the periphery, confining the sheet along its margins. If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an archipelago, at least until isostasy lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost at latitudes 63¬∞‚Äì65¬∞N; the northern dome reaches about at about latitude 72¬∞N (the fourth highest \\"summit\\" of Greenland). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of Melville Bay southeast of Thule. Large outlet glaciers, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is Jakobshavn Glacier (), which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of per day. On the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about , occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about . On 22 December 1991, a temperature of was recorded at an automatic weather station near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, making it the lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere. The record went unnoticed for more than 28 years and was finally recognized in 2020.WMO verifies -69.6¬∞C Greenland temperature as Northern hemisphere record  Change of the ice sheet  Melting ice during July 2012, images created by NASA show the process in the summer NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour about Greenland's ice sheet. = The ice sheet as a record of past climates = The ice sheet, consisting of layers of compressed snow from more than 100,000 years, contains in its ice today's most valuable record of past climates. In the past decades, scientists have drilled ice cores up to deep. Scientists have, using those ice cores, obtained information on (proxies for) temperature, ocean volume, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity, desert extent and forest fires. This variety of climatic proxies is greater than in any other natural recorder of climate, such as tree rings or sediment layers. = The melting ice sheet = = Summary = Many scientists who study the ice ablation in Greenland consider that an increase in temperature of two or three degrees Celsius would result in a complete melting of Greenland's ice and leave Greenland completely submerged in water. Positioned in the Arctic, the Greenland ice sheet is especially vulnerable to climate change. Arctic climate is believed to be now rapidly warming and much larger Arctic shrinkage changes are projected.Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Cambridge University Press, 2004. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years since detailed records have been kept and is likely to contribute substantially to sea level rise as well as to possible changes in ocean circulation in the future. The area of the sheet that experiences melting has been argued to have increased by about 16% between 1979 (when measurements started) and 2002 (most recent data). The area of melting in 2002 broke all previous records. The number of glacial earthquakes at the Helheim Glacier and the northwest Greenland glaciers increased substantially between 1993 and 2005. In 2006, estimated monthly changes in the mass of Greenland's ice sheet suggest that it is melting at a rate of about per year. A more recent study, based on reprocessed and improved data between 2003 and 2008, reports an average trend of per year.ScienceDaily, 10 October 2008: \\"An Accurate Picture Of Ice Loss In Greenland\\" These measurements came from the US space agency's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, launched in 2002, as reported by BBC. Using data from two ground-observing satellites, ICESAT and ASTER, a study published in Geophysical Research Letters (September 2008) shows that nearly 75 percent of the loss of Greenland's ice can be traced back to small coastal glaciers.Small Glaciers Account for Most of Greenland's Recent Ice Loss Newswise, Retrieved on September 15, 2008. If the entire of ice were to melt, global sea levels would rise . Recently, fears have grown that continued climate change will make the Greenland Ice Sheet cross a threshold where long- term melting of the ice sheet is inevitable. Climate models project that local warming in Greenland will be to during this century. Ice sheet models project that such a warming would initiate the long-term melting of the ice sheet, leading to a complete melting of the ice sheet (over centuries), resulting in a global sea level rise of about . Such a rise would inundate almost every major coastal city in the world. How fast the melt would eventually occur is a matter of discussion. According to the IPCC 2001 report, such warming would, if kept from rising further after the 21st Century, result in 1 to 5 meter sea level rise over the next millennium due to Greenland ice sheet melting. Some scientists have cautioned that these rates of melting are overly optimistic as they assume a linear, rather than erratic, progression. James E. Hansen has argued that multiple positive feedbacks could lead to nonlinear ice sheet disintegration much faster than claimed by the IPCC. According to a 2007 paper, \\"we find no evidence of millennial lags between forcing and ice sheet response in paleoclimate data. An ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable, and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\\" The melt zone, where summer warmth turns snow and ice into slush and melt ponds of meltwater, has been expanding at an accelerating rate in recent years. When the meltwater seeps down through cracks in the sheet, it accelerates the melting and, in some areas, allows the ice to slide more easily over the bedrock below, speeding its movement to the sea. Besides contributing to global sea level rise, the process adds freshwater to the ocean, which may disturb ocean circulation and thus regional climate. In July 2012, this melt zone extended to 97 percent of the ice cover. Ice cores show that events such as this occur approximately every 150 years on average. The last time a melt this large happened was in 1889. This particular melt may be part of cyclical behavior; however, Lora Koenig, a Goddard glaciologist suggested that \\"...if we continue to observe melting events like this in upcoming years, it will be worrisome.\\" Global warming is increasing growth of algae on the ice sheet. This darkens the ice causing it to absorb more sunlight and potentially increasing the rate of melting.Sea level fears as Greenland darkens BBC Meltwater around Greenland may transport nutrients in both dissolved and particulate phases to the ocean. Measurements of the amount of iron in meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet show that extensive melting of the ice sheet might add an amount of this micronutrient to the Atlantic Ocean equivalent to that added by airborne dust. However much of the particles and iron derived from glaciers around Greenland may be trapped within the extensive fjords that surround the island and, unlike the HNLC Southern ocean where iron is an extensive limiting micronutrient, biological production in the North Atlantic is subject only to very spatially and temporally limited periods of iron limitation. Nonetheless high productivity is observed in the immediate vicinity of major marine terminating glaciers around Greenland and this is attributed to meltwater inputs driving the upwelling of seawater rich in macronutrients.

In a 2013 study published in Nature, 133 researchers analyzed a Greenland ice core from the Eemian interglacial. They concluded that during this geological period, roughly 130,000‚Äì115,000 years ago, the GIS (Greenland Ice Sheet) was 8 degrees C warmer than today. This resulted in a thickness decrease of the northwest Greenland ice sheet by 400 ¬± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 ¬± 300 metres lower than at present. Researchers have considered that clouds may enhance Greenland ice sheet melt. A study published in Nature in 2013 found that optically thin liquid-bearing clouds extended this July 2012 extreme melt zone, while a Nature Communications study in 2016 suggests that clouds in general enhance Greenland ice sheet's meltwater runoff by more than 30% due to decreased meltwater refreezing in the firn layer at night. A 2015 study by climate scientists Michael Mann of Penn State and Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research suggests that the observed cold blob in the North Atlantic during years of temperature records is a sign that the Atlantic Ocean's Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings, and concluded that the AMOC circulation shows exceptional slowdown in the last century, and that Greenland melt is a possible contributor. In August 2020 scientists reported that melting of the Greenland ice sheet is shown to have passed the point of no return, based on 40 years of satellite data. The switch to a dynamic state of sustained mass loss resulted from widespread retreat in 2000-2005. lost a record amount of ice during 2019. A study published in 2016, by researchers from the University of South Florida, Canada and the Netherlands, used GRACE satellite data to estimate freshwater flux from Greenland. They concluded that freshwater runoff is accelerating, and could eventually cause a disruption of AMOC in the future, which would affect Europe and North America. The United States built a secret nuclear powered base, called Camp Century, in the Greenland ice sheet. In 2016, a group of scientists evaluated the environmental impact and estimated that due to changing weather patterns over the next few decades, melt water could release the nuclear waste, 20,000 liters of chemical waste and 24 million liters of untreated sewage into the environment. However, so far neither US or Denmark has taken responsibility for the clean-up. A 2018 international study found that the fertilizing effect of meltwater around Greenland is highly sensitive to the glacier grounding line depth it is released at. Retreat of Greenland's large marine-terminating glaciers inland will diminish the fertilizing effect of meltwater- even with further large increases in freshwater discharge volume. On 13 August 2020, Communications Earth and Environment, a Nature Research journal published a study on \\"Dynamic ice loss from the Greenland Ice sheet driven by sustained glacier retreat\\". The situation was described as being past the \\"point of no return\\" and attributed to two factors, \\"increased surface meltwater runoff and ablation of marine-terminating outlet glaciers via calving and submarine melting, termed ice discharge.\\" 50x50px Text and images are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. On 20 August 2020, scientists reported that the Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of 532 billion metric tons of ice during 2019, surpassing the old record of 464 billion metric tons in 2012 and returning to high melt rates, and provide explanations for the reduced ice loss in 2017 and 2018. 50px Text and images are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Meltwater creates rivers caused by cryoconite on July 21, 2012 moulins Two mechanisms have been utilized to explain the change in velocity of the Greenland Ice Sheets outlet glaciers. The first is the enhanced meltwater effect, which relies on additional surface melting, funneled through moulins reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. (Not all meltwater is retained in the ice sheet and some moulins drain into the ocean, with varying rapidity.) This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp.\\"Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow by Zwally et al., \\" (The acceleration lasted between two and three months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \\"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\\". Examination of recent rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers.\\"Fracture Propagation to the Base of the Greenland Ice Sheet During Supraglacial Lake Drainage by Das. et al.,\\" The second mechanism is a force imbalance at the calving front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. This is akin to letting off the emergency brake a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction.\\"Thomas R.H (2004), Force-perturbation analysis of recent thinning and acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, Journal of Glaciology 50 (168): 57‚Äì66. \\" For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water at the base of the glacier that helps lubricate the flow. If the enhanced meltwater effect is the key, then since meltwater is a seasonal input, velocity would have a seasonal signal and all glaciers would experience this effect. If the force imbalance effect is the key, then the velocity will propagate up-glacier, there will be no seasonal cycle, and the acceleration will be focused on calving glaciers. Helheim Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus from the 1970s‚Äì2000. In 2001‚Äì2005 the glacier retreated and accelerated from /day, while thinning up to in the terminus region. Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus history from 1960 to 2002. The glacier velocity was /day in the 1990s. In 2004‚Äì2005 it accelerated to /day and thinned by up to in the lower reach of the glacier. On Sermeq Kujalleq the acceleration began at the calving front and spread up- glacier in 1997 and up to inland by 2003. On Helheim the thinning and velocity propagated up-glacier from the calving front. In each case the major outlet glaciers accelerated by at least 50%, much larger than the impact noted due to summer meltwater increase. On each glacier the acceleration was not restricted to the summer, persisting through the winter when surface meltwater is absent. An examination of 32 outlet glaciers in southeast Greenland indicates that the acceleration is significant only for marine-terminating outlet glaciers‚Äîglaciers that calve into the ocean. A 2008 study noted that the thinning of the ice sheet is most pronounced for marine-terminating outlet glaciers.\\"Greenland Ice Sheet: is land-terminating ice thinning at anomalously high rates by Sole et al.,\\" As a result of the above, all concluded that the only plausible sequence of events is that increased thinning of the terminus regions, of marine-terminating outlet glaciers, ungrounded the glacier tongues and subsequently allowed acceleration, retreat and further thinning.\\"Rapid and synchronous ice-dynamic changes in East Greenland by Luckman, Murray. de Lange and Hanna\\" \\"Greenland Ice Sheet: is land-terminating ice thinning at anomalously high rates by Sole et al.,\\" \\"Moulins calving fronts and Greenland outletglacier acceleration by Pelto\\" Warmer temperatures in the region have brought increased precipitation to Greenland, and part of the lost mass has been offset by increased snowfall. However, there are only a small number of weather stations on the island, and though satellite data can examine the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25‚Äì80 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.\\"Modelling Precipitation over ice sheets: an assessment using Greenland\\", Gerard H. Roe, University of Washington, = Rate of change = Arctic Temperature Trend 1981‚Äì2007 Several factors determine the net rate of growth or decline. These are # Accumulation and melting rates of snow in the central parts # Melting of surface snow and ice which then flows into moulins, falls and flows to bedrock, lubricates the base of glaciers, and affects the speed of glacial motion. This flow is implicated in accelerating the speed of glaciers and thus the rate of glacial calving. # Melting of ice along the sheet's margins (runoff) and basal hydrology, # Iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet's edges Explanation of accelerated glacial coastward movement and iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased weight of the central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed on the surface and later disappeared under the ice.Wikipedia, A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F Lightning World War II fighter plane Glacier Girl that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition. The IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) estimated the accumulation to 520 ¬± 26 Gigatonnes of ice per year, runoff and bottom melting to 297¬±32 Gt/yr and 32¬±3 Gt/yr, respectively, and iceberg production to 235¬±33 Gt/yr. On balance, the IPCC estimates ‚àí44 ¬± 53 Gt/yr, which means that the ice sheet may currently be melting. Data from 1996 to 2005 shows that the ice sheet is thinning even faster than supposed by IPCC. According to the study, in 1996 Greenland was losing about per year in volume from its ice sheet. In 2005, this had increased to about a year due to rapid thinning near its coasts,\\"Greenland Ice Loss Doubles in Past Decade, Raising Sea Level Faster\\". Jet Propulsion Laboratory News release, Thursday, 16 February 2006. while in 2006 it was estimated at per year. It was estimated that in the year 2007 Greenland ice sheet melting was higher than ever, . Also snowfall was unusually low, which led to unprecedented negative Surface Mass Balance.http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/03388/EGU2008-A-03388-3.pdf?PHPSESSID= If iceberg calving has happened as an average, Greenland lost 294 Gt of its mass during 2007 (one km3 of ice weighs about 0.9 Gt). The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) noted, it is hard to measure the mass balance precisely, but most results indicate accelerating mass loss from Greenland during the 1990s up to 2005. Assessment of the data and techniques suggests a mass balance for the Greenland Ice Sheet ranging between growth of 25 Gt/yr and loss of 60 Gt/yr for 1961 to 2003, loss of 50 to 100 Gt/yr for 1993 to 2003 and loss at even higher rates between 2003 and 2005.Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 996 pp. Analysis of gravity data from GRACE satellites indicates that the Greenland ice sheet lost approximately 2900 Gt (0.1% of its total mass) between March 2002 and September 2012. The mean mass loss rate for 2008‚Äì2012 was 367 Gt/year. Glaciologist at work A study published in 2020 estimated, by combining 26 individual estimates of mass balance derived by tracking changes in Greenland's ice sheet volume, speed and gravity as part of the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, that the Greenland Ice Sheet had lost a total of 3,902 gigatons (Gt) of ice between 1992 and 2018 . The rate of ice loss has increased over time from 26 ¬± 27 Gt/year between 1992 and 1997 to 244 ¬± 28 Gt/year between 2012 and 2017 with a peak mass loss rate of 275 ¬± 28 Gt/year during the period 2007 and 2012. Alt URL A paper on Greenland's temperature record shows that the warmest year on record was 1941 while the warmest decades were the 1930s and 1940s. The data used was from stations on the south and west coasts, most of which did not operate continuously the entire study period. While Arctic temperatures have generally increased, there is some discussion concerning the temperatures over Greenland. First of all, Arctic temperatures are highly variable, making it difficult to discern clear trends at a local level. Also, until recently, an area in the North Atlantic including southern Greenland was one of the only areas in the World showing cooling rather than warming in recent decades,see Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004) and IPCC Second Assessment Report, among others. but this cooling was replaced by strong warming in the period 1979‚Äì2005.IPCC, 2007.

His popularity started well before World War II and continued well into the 1980s. He had a characteristic way of staying very serious yet slightly emotional on stage when singing. Fogg had a lyric baritone voice and can be compared to French Tino Rossi in style. Biography Mieczys≈Çaw Fogiel was born 30 May 1901 in Warsaw, then a province guberniya capital in Imperial Russia. He spent his childhood there and, after graduating from a local gymnasium in 1922, he started working as a railway worker. About that time, he also joined the choir of the St. Anne's Church. There his friend, Ludwik Sempoli≈Ñski, made him join the classes of music organized by Jan ≈Åysakowski, Eugeniusz Mossakowski, Wac≈Çaw Brzezi≈Ñski, Ignacy Dygas and many other notable Polish musicians of the epoch. Initially a hobbyist, in 1928 he met W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dani≈Çowski Dan, who chose him as a soloist for his newly formed Dan's Choir. The choir became extremely popular the following year when Jerzy Petersburski's song Tango Milonga became an international hit. This and other tangos and romances performed by the choir in the famous Qui pro Quo theatre led Fogiel to become one of the most popular Polish singers. After 1932, Fogiel, under a new pseudonym of Fogg, toured a number of countries, including Germany, Latvia, the Soviet Union, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Italy. In the United States, the group toured over 31 states. His popularity was increased by the fact that Fogg was keen on languages and was able to sing in local languages of the countries he toured. He also appeared in a number of duos with other popular artists of the time, including Hanka Ordon√≥wna, Stefcia G√≥rska, Zula Pogorzelska and Adolf Dymsza. He also appeared in 11 films. After the Dana Choir was disbanded in 1938, Fogg started a solo career. The same year, he was chosen as the most popular Polish singer by the Polish Radio. He toured the country with a trio composed of himself, Mira Zimi≈Ñska and Tadeusz Sygiety≈Ñski. Among the authors of his songs was also Marian Hemar. After the outbreak of World War II, Fogg remained in Warsaw, where he joined the underground Armia Krajowa. He gave concerts in the few cafes available to Poles under German occupation. During the Warsaw Uprising, he gave countless concerts both on the barricades, in hospitals and in the bomb shelters beneath the city. For his efforts to keep high the morale of the soldiers and civilians of the fighting city, he was awarded with some of the highest Polish decorations. Fogg was also one of the Polish Righteous among the Nations. He hid a Jewish family of Ivo WesbyFilip ≈Åobodzi≈Ñski: \\"Fogg ocali≈Ç palto\\". Newsweek.Polska. 16 August 2009. in his apartment until the end of World War II. After the war, in 1945, he opened up his own cafe in the ruins of Warsaw. The cafe, located at 119 Marsza≈Çkowska Street, was the first music theatre opened after the war in the destroyed city and served as one of the very few centres of culture. However, the following year, it was nationalized by the new communist authorities of Poland and closed soon afterwards. Fogg continued to give hundreds of concerts in all parts of Poland and also headed his private music record firm Fogg Records, which shared the fate of Fogg's cafe in 1951. His popularity as a singer remained high and in 1958 he was again chosen the most popular Polish singer by the audience of the Polish Radio ‚Äì 20 years after he was given the same title for the first time. He continued to give concerts almost until his death in 1990. Throughout his 60-year long career, he gave more than 16,000 of them in all countries of Europe, Brasil, Israel, Ceylon, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US. His everlasting popularity led to the creation of a number of anecdotes. In one of them, the Polish archaeologists supposedly discovered an Egyptian mummy. After they unfolded it, they were surprised by the mummy asking a short question: \\"Is Fogg still giving concerts?\\" Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg died in Warsaw on 3 September 1990 and is buried at the Br√≥dno Cemetery.

Starr writes that \\"as a classical scholar he had few equals in the United States . . . his knowledge of English history and literature was extensive; he was a pen- and-ink artist of marked ability; as a sportsman he was unsurpassed; his pupils idolized him.\\" Biography The eldest son of William Herbert, Dean of Manchester (himself the son of Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Carnarvon), Herbert was born in London.THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE Of Literature, Art, and Science Herbert was educated at Eton College and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1830. Having lost his property through a dishonest agent, he emigrated to the United States in 1831 and for the following eight years taught Latin and Greek at a private school in New York City. In 1833 he started the American Monthly Magazine, which he edited, in conjunction with A. D. Patterson, till 1835 when he withdrew as a result of disagreements with his associate, Charles Fenno Hoffman. His vanity and arrogance due to his ancestry, his father being the son of the Earl of Carnarvon and his mother, the Hon. Letitia Emily Dorothea Allen, a daughter of Viscount Allen, did not win him many friends. Edgar Allan Poe felt that he was \\"not unapt to fall into pompous grandiloquence\\" and sometimes was \\"woefully turgid\\", while others saw his novels as \\"prolix, lacking in imagination and humor.\\" Herbert was a man of varied accomplishments, translating many of the novels of Eug√®ne Sue and Alexandre Dumas, p√®re into English. He is listed as a contributor to the first edition of The New American Cyclopedia by way of writing articles on Archery, Armour, Austerlitz, Balaklava, St. Bartholomew Massacre, Carthage, Charles I & II of England, Charles XII of Sweden etc. In 1839 Herbert married Sarah Barker, of Bangor, Maine. They had one son, William George, and one daughter, Louisa. Sarah died 11 March 1844, and their daughter, Louisa, died on 19 August of the same year. William George, their son, was sent to school in England and remained there. Fifteen years later he married Adela Budlong, who filed for divorce after three months. Herbert was staying at the Stevens Hotel in Manhattan, New York City and invited several men to dine with him on what would be the last night of his life. Only one gentleman accepted his invention, Philip Hone Anthon, a pupil of Herbert's, who accepted the invitation because, as he testified at the inquest, Herbert \\"had complained of feeling very lonely because his wife had left him\\". After this he begged Anthon to spend as much time as possible with him. While talking with Anthon, Herbert dashed into his bedroom and shot himself. He took his own life on 17 May 1858 at 2:00 am. Publications In 1834 Herbert published his first novel, The Brothers: a Tale of the Fronde, which was followed by a number of others that achieved popularity including: * The Village Inn; or the Adventures of Bellechassaigne (1843) * Marmaduke Wyvil; or The Maid's Revenge (1843) * The Lord Of The Manor; or, Rose Castleton's Temptation: An Old English Story (1844) * Guarica, the Charib Bride: A Legend of Hispaniola (1844) * The Warwick Woodlands; or Things as They Were There (1845) * The Roman Traitor; or the Days of Cicero, Cato and Cataline [sic], A True Tale of The Republic (1846) * The Deerstalkers; or, Circumstantial Evidence: A Tale of the South-Western Counties (1849) *The Fair Puritan.

Picturesquely situated in a high valley of the Hohe Tauern mountain range, it is known for the Gastein Waterfall and a variety of Belle √âpoque hotel buildings. Geography View of the upper Gastein valley Bad Gastein is located in the historic Pongau region, the municipal area of about is the largest in St. Johann im Pongau District. It stretches along the upper Gastein Valley following the course of the Gastein Ache creek, a right tributary of the Salzach river. The valley separates the Hohe Tauern Ankogel Group in the east from the Goldberg Group in the west. The town centre is located at the Gastein Falls, about above sea level. It is characterised by numerous historic multi-storey hotel buildings erected on the steep slopes. The Gastein municipality comprises the cadastral communities of Badgastein, B√∂ckstein, and Remsach. Its southern parts belong to the Hohe Tauern national park. = Transportation = The Gastein valley is accessible by the Tauern Railway, a major railroad running from Schwarzach- Sankt Veit in the north across the Alpine crest through the Tauern Tunnel to Spittal an der Drau, Carinthia in the south. Frequent EuroCity and InterCity trains going along this route connect Bad Gastein with many Austrian cities like Vienna, Linz, Salzburg and Graz along a single circuit. The B167 Gasteiner Stra√üe highway also passes right through the Gastein valley. Through traffic from the northern branch-off at Lend in the Salzach valley passes the lower municipalities of Dorfgastein and Bad Hofgastein before reaching the Bad Gastein centre. However, in B√∂ckstein at the head of the valley, the continuation southwards to Mallnitz in Carinthia requires cars to roll onto a shuttle train (Autoverladung) for a short trip through the Tauern Tunnel. = Spa and therapy = Grand Hotel del' Europe The name \\"Bad\\" means \\"spa\\", reflecting the town's history as a health resort. The local Heilstollen (literally 'healing tunnel') thermal spring water earned the town its early fame. Theophrastus Parcelsus (1493‚Äì1541) had studied the spring water to discover its secrets. Marie Curie (1867‚Äì1934) and Heinrich Mache (1876‚Äì1954) helped to discover that it contained radon and as a result radon therapy began in the town. Radon inhalation therapy at the Gasteiner Heilstollen began as a result of further investigation into the anecdotal experiences of silver miners who noticed improvements in symptoms from various ailments including arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis (also known as Bekhterev's disease), in particular, has seen positive results from treatment at the Heilstollen. However, there is very little empirical evidence of any benefit to inhaling radon. For example, one of the few studies to test the efficacy of spa treatments for Ankylosing spondylitis found no statistically significant difference between a group that spent three weeks at Bad Gastein and a group that spent three weeks at a different spa without radon inhalation therapy.van Tubergen et al., \\"Combined spa-exercise therapy is effective in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: a randomized controlled trial.\\" Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Oct;45(5):430-8, http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi- bin/fulltext/85515153/HTMLSTART Gastein waterfall  History  The remote valley was settled by Bavarian peasants in the 9th century; field names in the highest-lying southern parts also denote a Carantanian (Slavic) colonization. Gastein is first mentioned as Gastuna in a 963 deed, when the area belonged to the German stem duchy of Bavaria. It was originally an alpine farming and gold mining area and the site of an ancient trade route crossing the main ridge of the Central Eastern Alps. In 1297 Duke Otto III and his brother Stephen I, both highly indebted, sold it to the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg. Already about 1230, the minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental had referred to the hot springs in his Middle High German poem Die Graserin in der Gastein; the spas were visited by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III as well as by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus. In the 19th century the waters of Bad Gastein became a fashionable resort, visited by European monarchs as well as the rich and famous. Some notable guests of the past included Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sisi) and the German Emperor Wilhelm I with his chancellor Otto von Bismarck as well as Subhas Chandra Bose, a leading Indian nationalist, Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, King Faisal I of Iraq, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia and Iran's last king Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, industrialists like Wilhelm von Opel and artists like Heinrich Mann, Robert Stolz and W. Somerset Maugham. On 14 August 1865 Bismarck had signed the Gastein Convention with Austria concerning the joint administration of the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein after the Second Schleswig War. The composer Franz Schubert composed his Piano Sonata in D Major in Bad Gastein, and was once believed to have sketched a Gmunden-Gastein Symphony (D. 849) during his stay in August and September 1825. Though no score appears to have survived for the latter, it is often identified with the Symphony No. 9 in C major (D. 944). Mass tourism was pushed by the opening of the Tauern Railway station in 1905. From the 1960s on the resort lost some of its former notoriety and many former hotels sit empty. During the past few years, Bad Gastein renovated its Felsentherme and the Congress Center. = Places of interest = Catholic parish church * * Catholic parish church * Gletscherm√ºhlen * Felsentherme * Gasteiner Heilstollen * Gasteiner Heimatmuseum im Haus Austria = Traditions = Bad Gastein has vibrant pagan traditions that have been slightly assimilated into Roman Catholic tradition. One example of the pre-Christian Alpine traditions is the Krampus, now adopted as one of the Companions of Saint Nicholas. The Krampus is an elemental, horned and demonic character, playfully re-enacted by bands of male revellers during December and also once every four years during a Perchten event or Perchtenlauf. The Perchtenlauf happens every four years at Bad Gastein. The most recent was in 2014. Climate Bad Gastein has a humid continental climate (Dfb) bordering on a subarctic climate (Dfc) due to the town's high elevation. Summers are mild, sometimes warm with cool, refreshing nights. Winters are moderately cold and snowy, with annual snowfall averaging 136 inches (345 cm).  Sports  View from ski slopes of the valley with Bad Hofgastein in the bottom-right Beside its water treatments, the town is popular for winter sports. Bad Gastein hosted the 1958 World Championships in alpine skiing and regularly is a scene of the snowboarding and boardercross worldcup. The Bad Gastein and Bad Hofgastein ski resort is part of the larger Ski Amad√© network, it contains moderate to good skiing/snowboarding, with plenty of chairlifts and gondolas. Many establishments on the slopes offer warmth, food and strong drinks. Since 2007, the town also annually hosts the Gastein Ladies tennis tournament, an International event on the WTA Tour, attracting top players like Julia G√∂rges.

The Society was granted a Royal Charter in 1841.  Background  For many years the promotion of invention and improvements of all sorts was the main business of the Society, and its meetings were the focus of a large and active cross-section of Edinburgh society - academics, gentry, professionals such as civil engineers and lawyers, and skilled craftsmen such as instrument makers, engravers and printers. The Society's published Transactions provide a record of changes in technology, and the Society's archive is held by the National Library of Scotland, and is a valuable resource to researchers. In more recent times, the Society's meeting programme has been based on lectures given by expert and often distinguished speakers. The lectures cover a wide range of scientific and technical topics, and still with the original aim of keeping the membership informed about current concerns in science, engineering, medicine, and often with a topical edge. Meetings of the Society are held in Edinburgh monthly, at 7pm on Monday evenings, from October or November to May or June.

Early career Wahl was educated at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He was a professor at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, broken by World War II. He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp (north-east of Paris) and then escaped. He began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s (his book on Hegel was published in 1929), ahead of Alexandre Koj√®ve's more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist S√∏ren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books Le malheur de la conscience dans la philosophie de Hegel (1929) and √âtudes kierkegaardiennes (1938) were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of Ac√©phale, Georges Bataille's review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled \\"Nietzsche and the Death of God\\", concerning Karl Jaspers' interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher, in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete. In exile While in the USA, Wahl with Gustave Cohen and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation founded a 'university in exile', the √âcole Libre des Hautes √âtudes, in New York City. Later, at Mount Holyoke where he had a position, he set up the D√©cades de Mount Holyoke, also known as Pontigny-en- Am√©rique, modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins (November 22, 1859 - March 13, 1940) at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy. These successfully gathered together French intellectuals in wartime exile, ostensibly studying the English language, with Americans including Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and Roger Sessions. Wahl, already a published poet, made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the Four Quartets and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. (See, e.g., his \\"On Reading the Four Quartets.\\" ) Post World War II In post-war France Wahl was an important figure, as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the Coll√®ge philosophique, influential center for non-conformist intellectuals, alternative to the Sorbonne.Emmanuel Levinas √âthique et infini, 1982, p. 47. Starting in 1950, he headed the Revue de M√©taphysique et de Morale. Wahl translated the second hypothesis of the Parmenides of Plato as \\"Il y a de l'Un\\", and Jacques Lacan adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis, as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan, and the negative one is \\"Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel \\" -- there is no such a thing as a sexual relationship.

She was regent during her husband's absence. Life Berthold IV of Andechs and his wife Agnes among their children She was the daughter of the Bavarian Count Berthold IV of Andechs, Margrave of Carniola and Istria, who had been elevated to the mostly honorific title Duke of Merania by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and his wife Agnes from the Saxon House of Wettin. Gertrude's elder sister was Agnes of Merania, a famous beauty, who married King Philip II of France. Her younger sister was St. Hedwig of Silesia, wife of the Piast duke Henry I the Bearded, the later High Duke of Poland. Their brothers were Otto, who inherired the title of Duke of Merania and succeeded their father in his Bavarian domains, Henry who took over the rule in Carniola and Istria, and Berthold who became a close advisor to Gertrude, and was named Archbishop of Kalocsa. =Marriage= Her parents wanted their daughters to all make important political marriages, which would create alliances for Duke Berthold IV. Gertrude married the √Årp√°d prince Andrew II, younger son of late King B√©la III of Hungary, before 1203. Andrew thereby took sides in the conflict over the German throne, joining his father-in-law in his support of Duke Philip of Swabia, while his elder brother King Emeric of Hungary backed King Otto IV of Germany. The couple had five children: * Anna Maria of Hungary (c. 1204 ‚Äì 1237), wife of Tzar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria * King B√©la IV of Hungary (1206 ‚Äì 3 May 1270) * Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1207 ‚Äì 10 November 1231), wife of Landgraf Louis IV of Thuringia * King Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria (1208 ‚Äì June 1241) * Prince Andrew II of Halych (c. 1210 ‚Äì 1234) =Queen= Ambitious Gertrude exerted much political influence over her husband. It was probably she who persuaded Andrew to conspire against his brother again, but when King Emeric, who had realised that Andrew's troops outnumbered his armies, went unarmed, wearing only the crown and the sceptre, to Andrew's camp near Varasd, Andrew surrendered voluntarily on the spur of the scene. The king had his brother arrested, but Andrew managed to escape shortly afterwards. During this time, Gertrude was sent back to her father. Things improved for her, when Prince Andrew took over the government of the Hungarian kingdom upon the death of King Emeric in 1204, officially as regent for his minor nephew Ladislaus III, who nevertheless died driven in exile one year later. =Regent= While the king was in battle, Gertrude gave out Hungarian land as \\"gifts\\" to her favorites. According to medieval chroniclers, one third of the country was given away but the magnates got it back after the queen's death. Thus, Hungary did not prosper. During the frequent absence of her husband, the queen was regent and, as Dietrich of Apolda states, conducted the affairs of the kingdom \\"like a man\\". In 1206 her younger brother Berthold was installed as Archbishop of Kalocsa, in 1212 he was also appointed Voivode of Transylvania. =Murder= While King Andrew was campaigning in Galicia, the Hungarian nobles, led by Peter, son of T√∂re decided to get rid of the queen and in 1213, on a hunt with Berthold and their guest Duke Leopold VI of Austria in the Pilis Mountains, she was killed. Gertrude's body was torn to pieces, her brother and Duke Leopold narrowly escaped with their lives. Due to the current political situation most of her murderers remained unpunished during the rule of Andrew II. Only Gertrude's son King B√©la IV took revenge after his accession to the throne. Gertrude's tomb was of a Gothic style. Her tomb was excavated between 1967 and 1980.Translation from German Wikipedia, with further sources, Retrieved 2014-03-18 On Gertrude's death, Andrew married Yolanda de Courtenay. In culture She is the main antagonist in Ferenc Erkel's opera, B√°nk b√°n. It is based on a true story, centring around Gertrude's assassination: Lord B√°nk, a nobleman went touring the country on Gertrude's order, while the king was on crusade. His young wife stayed at home. Gertrude's brother fell in love with the young woman but she was afraid of him. Gertude encouraged her brother. When Lord B√°nk heard of this, he was very angry and he was leader of the group of men that killed the queen. Her brother fled for his life.

It is located approximately an hour from the Tyrolean capital city of Innsbruck. Population Tourism The town offers a variety of summer and winter sports including skiing, hiking, mountain biking and paragliding. Mayrhofen is situated near the Hintertux glacier, which, at above sea level, is above the snowline. Skiing is available all year round here. Mayrhofen sits between the Penken and the Ahorn mountains which provide ski runs in the winter and mountain biking, hiking and paragliding in the summer. The Ahorn offers mainly easy and intermediate runs, but also has a long, steep black run (formerly red) which was once on the World Cup Downhill circuit but was removed as it was deemed too dangerous. The Penken mountain offers Austria's steepest piste, named Harakiri, as well as a large range of ski runs at different levels of difficulty. It is connected by lifts with the villages of Finkenberg, Lanersbach and Schwendau. tricable detachable gondola lift Penkenbahn and its stations The Penken is reached by a Gondola system which is located on the main street next to the Sport Hotel Strass, in the centre of the village, while the Ahorn Cable car, which with a capacity of 160 passengers is the largest cable car in Austria, is situated at the southern end of the town. Mayrhofen is a snowboard-minded village with a funpark sponsored by Vans, and the snowboardhotel Gasthof Zillertal owned by the Dutch organisation 'SAIKO expeditions'. Mountaineer Peter Habeler and Downhill Racer Uli Spiess both come from Mayrhofen. The town also provides an excellent base for walkers, as Mayrhofen is home to many trails touring the mountains and nearby Ziller valley.  Events  Each spring (usually early April), Mayrhofen hosts the Snowbombing music festival. Since the initial event in 2000 (held in Risoul, France), snowbombing has gathered much notoriety and respect in the electronic dance music world as one of the major festivals. The event has been hosted by Mayrhofen since 2005. Climate  Transport  The railway station at Mayrhofen im Zillertal. Mayrhofen has one railway station, which is located next to the Zillertaler Bundestrasse. The station is a terminus for all Train services operated by the Zillertalbahn, the valley's main public transport operator. The railway runs between Jenbach and Mayrhofen itself, and there are several intermediate stations, which provide access to many of the valley's well known ski areas, namely Zell am Ziller (Zillertal 3000), F√ºgen (Spieljoch) and Uderns (for the Hochf√ºgen and Kaltenbach ski areas). The railway operates year-round, although in summer additional 'special' services operate, such as a steam train service. The Zillertalbahn also run bus routes in the valley, which are regular and cover an extensive area. Additional services also operate during the winter, to cater for the skiing season.

He was a lifelong resident of Aberdeen, northeast Scotland, where he was a prosperous chemist and dyer, amongst other ventures. Davidson was educated at Marischal College, where he studied second and third year classes of Marischal College from 1819-1821, including lectures from Professor Patrick Copland. He got this education in return for being a lab assistant. In the 1820s he set up in business close to the Aberdeen-Inverurie Canal, at first supplying yeast, before becoming involved in the manufacture and supply of chemicals. He became interested in the new electrical technologies of the day. From 1837, he made small electric motors on his own principles, though William H. Taylor in the US made similar motors from 1838. Both men worked independently without knowledge of the other's work. Exhibitions Davidson staged an exhibition of electrical machinery at Aberdeen, Scotland, and in Edinburgh where it was viewed on February 12, 1842, by the young James Clerk Maxwell.Anthony F. Anderson (11 June 1981) Forces of Inspiration, The New Scientist, pages 712,3 via Google Books Later he exhibited at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in London, where he hoped to attract sponsorship for his work.John S. Reid Robert Davidson ‚Äî pioneer electrician from Natural Philosophy Museum, University of Aberdeen Among the machines shown were his locomotive, an electrically driven lathe and printing press, and an electromagnet capable of lifting 2 tons. Electric locomotives Davidson made a model electric locomotive in 1837. His Galvani of 1842 was a four-wheeled machine, powered by zinc-acid batteries. It was tested on the Edinburgh-Glasgow line in September 1842 and, although found capable of carrying itself at 4 mph, it did not haul any passengers or goods. =Davidson's legacy= He has been described as a forgotten hero and electrical visionary. He could not interest the rail companies; the technology he employed was too expensive. In 1840, the Aberdeen Banner had predicted that the type of machinery he was producing \\"will in no distant date supplant steam\\"; however, it was only when electric locomotives were introduced in the 1890s that the media came to recognize what he had done. He was described as the \\"oldest living electrician\\" and The Electrician magazine reported \\" Robert Davidson was undoubtedly the first to demonstrate the possibility of electrical traction in a practical way\\". A working model of his electrical motor can be seen at the Grampian Transport Museum. Business After 1843, at home in Aberdeen, he settled down to family life and, for the next fifty years, the running of his business at Canal Road. His earlier invention of a method for large-scale production of yeast, one of the staples of his chemical business, and the manufacture of perfumes were so remunerative that it allowed him to indulge his many interests of astronomy, collecting of fine china, valuable pictures and a large collection of violins.

Schwab in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation. Early life F. T. F., as he was known, was born on July 21, 1854 in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of William A. Lovejoy and his wife Mary Jane Robinson. In the late 1850s, William and his brothers Perry, George, Samuel and sister Jane, and their families, left Maryland and moved to southeastern Ohio. =First jobs= Around 1870, at the age of 16, FTF left home in Guernsey County, Ohio and went to Washington, Pennsylvania, where he obtained employment as a telegrapher. Shortly after that he went to Titusville, Pennsylvania, then the center of the new oil industry, and engaged in many different employments in that area, including the oil, telegraph and newspaper businesses. =Joins Carnegie Company= After ten years in Titusville, FTF went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he joined Carnegie Brothers Company in June 1881. His rise there was rapid and by 1889, at the age of 35, was an equity owner in the business. Two years later he was a member of the board of directors, sitting with such prominent titans of industry as Carnegie, Frick, Schwab and Phipps. Prominent businessman All through the 1890s, FTF continued his rise in the Carnegie companies, with the full trust and confidence of everyone in the inner circle. However, Carnegie and Frick had a falling out over the management and direction of the companies, resulting in a lawsuit by Frick against Carnegie. FTF, in order to resolve this matter, took the radical step of resigning all of his positions, thereby becoming a neutral party, trusted by all sides, and worked out the \\"new agreement,\\" as it was known, under which the United State Steel Company was to be formed. FTF later invested his substantial assets into gold mining interests in Idaho. Family life In 1892, FTF married Jane Clyde Fleming (1869‚Äì1941). Their children were Francis Fleming Lovejoy (1894‚Äì1916); Kenneth Frick Lovejoy (1896‚Äì1947); and Marjory (1899‚Äì1980). Kenneth (known as Curley) was one of the first air mail pilots, flying out of Bettis Field near Pittsburgh. FTF himself is reputed to be the first American ever to ride a bicycle. FTF died on December 5, 1932 and is buried in Pittsburgh's Allegheny Cemetery along with Jane and their three children. Retirement FTF was interested in genealogy and carried out a genealogical correspondence with Clarence Lovejoy (author of Lovejoy's College Guide), tracing the family back to England.

It was first published in Brisbane by the University of Queensland Press in 2000An extract was previously published as . It won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize in the same year. Despite its title, the book is fiction and a variation on the Ned Kelly story. Plot summary Ned Kelly begins his autobiography with a description of his father, John \\"Red\\" Kelly, an Irishman transported to Van Diemen's Land and eventually settling in the colony of Victoria, Australia. After marrying Ned's mother Ellen (n√©e Quinn), the Kellys settle in Avenel, a rural area northeast of Melbourne. Red Kelly is shown to have numerous brushes with the colonial police forces, resulting in his imprisonment and death when his son Ned was twelve years of age. After the rest of the family resettles in northeast Victoria under the Land Grant Act, Ned's mother attempts to provide for her children by running a shebeen and taking on a series of lovers, including the notorious bushranger Harry Power. Power agrees to take on the young Ned as an apprentice, and provides Ned with knowledge of the land, hideouts, and strategies for bushranging. Kelly eventually leaves Power and returns to his family's settlement, where he is shown making dogged attempts to live an honest lifestyle. Kelly is arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for reception of a stolen horse (although Kelly claims that a friend, \\"Wild\\" Wright, knowingly sold him the stolen horse without Kelly's knowledge ‚Äì Kelly later exacts revenge on Wright in a bare-knuckle boxing match). After two years of working as a sawmill hand, he is drawn back to bushranging when a herd of his horses is appropriated by a rival squatter. His descent back into crime is precipitated by a visit from a local police officer, Constable Alex Fitzpatrick. The policeman woos Ned's younger sister Kate, prompting Ned to reveal that Fitzpatrick has multiple mistresses in other towns and has no intention of marrying Kate. After his mother Ellen threatens the constable with violence, Fitzpatrick pulls his revolver on the family and Ned shoots him in the hand in self-defense. Although he dresses the wound and Fitzpatrick leaves while promising that no action will be taken, warrants for the arrest of Ned and his younger brother Dan are issued the next day. Ned Kelly and his brother Dan hide out in the hills of northeast Victoria, eventually being joined by their friends Steve Hart and Joe Byrne (later becoming known as the Kelly Gang). Kelly's mother is eventually arrested along with her baby daughter and imprisoned in Melbourne as enticement for Kelly to give himself up. A detachment of four policemen is eventually sent to kill the quartet after efforts to arrest them prove unsuccessful; the Kelly Gang ambushes them at Stringybark Creek, where Ned kills three of the policemen. This adds to the growing folklore surrounding the Kelly Gang, which they fuel by robbing banks and giving parts of the money to the lower-class settlers in Victoria who help to shelter the gang. During the gang's raids, Ned Kelly meets a young Irish girl named Mary Hearn, who already has a young son by Kelly's stepfather, George King. Kelly falls in love with Mary and makes plans to escape the colony with her after she becomes pregnant with his child. Crucially, it is Mary who motivates Kelly to begin writing the story of his life as a legacy for his future child, who she fears will never know its father. Following two successful bank robberies, Mary uses the money to emigrate to San Francisco with her son and Kelly's unborn daughter; Kelly remains behind, however, unwilling to leave Australia until his mother is released from jail. The gang is eventually cornered by a large squad of dozens of policemen (versus just four in the Kelly Gang) in the town of Glenrowan where the gang has taken numerous hostages and constructed several suits of plate-steel armor for protection. One of the hostages is the crippled local schoolmaster, Thomas Curnow, who encourages Kelly to relate the story of his entire life after seeing samples of his writing. Curnow betrays the gang by warning the incoming police train that the gang has sabotaged the tracks, feeling that history will view him as a \\"hero\\". The policemen surround the town and engage in a furious shootout with the armor-clad gang, seriously wounding Ned Kelly and killing the other three members of the gang. Kelly's narrative stops abruptly just before the shootout itself; a secondary narrator, identified as \\"S.C\\", relates the tale of the gunfight and Kelly's death by hanging. Since Curnow is shown to have escaped Glenrowan with Kelly's manuscripts, it is assumed that this narrator is a relative of Curnow's. Kelly dies a hero to the people of northeastern Victoria, with the legend of his life left to grow over time. Technique The novel is divided into thirteen sections (each ostensibly written by Kelly), with a short description at the beginning of each section describing the physical condition of the original manuscripts. The novel also includes a preface and a frame narrative at the end which describe the events of Kelly's final shootout at Glenrowan and his eventual death sentence. Carey departs from what is known about Kelly's life by providing him with a lover and a daughter, for whom he has been recording his life history whilst on the run from the police. The novel is written in a distinctive vernacular style, with little in the way of punctuation or grammar; the influence of Kelly's Irish heritage is also apparent in his language. The style is similar to Kelly's most famous surviving piece of writing, The Jerilderie Letter. Excepting the frame narratives of \\"S.C\\", the novel does not contain any commas. Although there is much profanity in the novel, it has been censored (replacing vulgarities with terms such as \\"effing\\" or \\"adjectival\\") for the benefit of Kelly's fictional daughter, presumably by Kelly himself. Reception English writer Robert McCrum named True History of the Kelly Gang one of the 100 greatest novels written in English. In 2019, the novel was ranked 53rd on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. In an effort to attract American readers to the story, the book's American publisher, Alfred Knopf, heralded the book as a \\"Great American Novel\\", even though the novel takes place entirely within Australia. The claim that this book is an \\"American novel\\" appears to be based on the fact that author Peter Carey, an Australian, has lived in New York City for many years.

The 'parcels' are entirely an invention of the author, as is the \\"Sons of Sieve\\", and the suggestion that Ellen Kelly and Harry Power were lovers. The character Mary Hearne, and her children, are entirely fictional; Ned Kelly is not known to have fathered any children in his lifetime, nor was he known to be romantically involved with any woman during his outlawry. Film adaptation A film adaptation of Carey's novel was released in Australian cinemas in January 2020. Directed by Justin Kurzel, the film's cast includes George MacKay as Ned Kelly and Russell Crowe as Harry Power.

Lying in the historic county boundaries of Derbyshire, Totley was amalgamated into the city of Sheffield in 1933,MDFS::Docs.Sheffield.Borders retrieved 2018-03-17. and is today part of the Dore and Totley electoral ward in the city, though it remains close to the contemporary county boundary of Derbyshire. Totley had a population of 7,963 in 2011.Totley is made up of 21 output areas in the Dore and Totley ward http://www.ukcensusdata.com/dore-and- totley-e05001048#sthash.PWwd7J2U.XA2I3dR9.dpbs Totley was shown at the 2011 census as being part of the ward of Dore and Totley. Totley was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Totinglee, the name meaning a forest clearing belonging to Tota (probably the Saxon lord). Totley Hall, built in 1623 and enlarged in the 19th century, was converted to a teacher training college in the 1950s and was latterly part of Sheffield Hallam University. Through the district run the Totley Brook and the Old Hay Brook, which are the two sources of the River Sheaf. Totley also lends its name to Totley Tunnel, the longest underland rail tunnel in the United Kingdom. This takes the Sheffield to Manchester line from Totley underneath the Totley Moor to Grindleford in Derbyshire. History and geography Totley was first referred to in the Domesday Survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror. It was then referred to as Totinglei. It has since had many a different spellings: *1086 Totinglei *1221 Totenleg *1234 Totingly *1275 Tottle *1293 Totleye *1320 Toteleye *1476 Tottynley *1487 Totteley *1585 Tottley *1629 Totles *1641 Tottingley Totley Moor looking towards Sheffield in winter 2005. The moors are a barren wasteland with little vegetation but heather and trees near brooks and streams. The Domesday book says this: \\\\- In Totinglei, Tolf had IV bovates of land hidable. Land for one plough. It is waste, wood, pasturable, 1 mile in length and half a mile in breadth. T.R.E. value X shillings now XII pence. Domesday Survey 1086 The area of Totley in 1086 was quite small, but by 1839 had grown seven-fold. The borders of Totley are agreed to be the Old Hay Brook, Totley Brook, Brown Edge, Lady Cross, Stony Ridge, along Hathersage Road and Blacka Dike. The lowest point is the junction between Old Hay Brook and Totley Brook (beginning of the River Sheaf) at 400 ft, the highest point is Flask Edge at 1300 ft. The underground is rich, and Totley Brick Works still produce bricks and ceramics to this day. At one time, Totley was one of the townships in the Hundred of Scarsdale, a sub-division of the county of Derbyshire. In 1934 Totley, along with Dore and Bradway became part of Hallam Ward, part of the City of Sheffield and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Totley is made of Totley Village (Hillfoot Road and Totley Hall Lane), Totley Moor (unpopulated), Totley Bents (Penny Lane), New Totley (called as such since the 30s) and Totley Rise (Baslow Road shops and Lower Bradway Bank). =Cannon Hall= Cannon Hall. Although there is little proof, there are assumptions that the hall was present in 829.Assumption made by Bessie Bunkers One hypothesis concerning the name of the hall is that it once belonged to the Canons of Beauchief.The monks passed the property when walking to Strawberry Lee Parish and council records show that the Pearsons family has lived in Totley since at least 1550 and still live in the village. Samuel Pearson farmed the area in 1550. In 1897, George Creswick bought the house and the land. =Totley Hall= Totley Hall. Totley Hall is generally believed to date back to at least 1623, as this date is carved over the Tudor arched doorway on the building's main facade. The carvings bear the characters GN 1623 WM, which seems to mean George Newbould. However the hall was the home of the Barker family, who were the squires of Dore and Totley for many generations. Which also seems to suggest the construction of the hall could have been commissioned by Edward Barker of Dore Hall, the current squire in 1623. The Barker family left their coat of arms above the fireplace in the main entrance lobby. The hall passed out of the ownership of the Barker family in the late 18th century. The hall was extended by John Dodsley Webster in 1883 and 1894. According to maps, fields have existed before this date as well as small buildings which would have been farm buildings. In 1791, Andrew Gallimore left the estate to his niece Hannah, wife of the Rev. D'Ewes Coke of Nottinghamshire. Coke died in 1811, and his son, another D'Ewes Coke, took over the hall and provided money for the construction of the infant school. The family sold the Totley Hall in 1881 to W.K. Marples for ¬£2250. It is at this period that the hall and the farm became two distinct properties. William Aldam Milner built the lodge on Totley Hall Lane in 1887. His son was killed in World War I and as a sign of thanks the saddened community gave land and ¬£2000 to build a new church. All Saints church opened in 1924. Milner died in 1931. The hall with 160 acres of land was bought by Sheffield Corporation for ¬£5850 in July 1944. Until 1999, Totley Hall was owned by Sheffield Polytechnic which became Sheffield Hallam University in 1991. Sheffield Hallam University sold the property to developers who converted the hall into luxury apartments. Old Totley School. =The Old School House= The Infant School was built in 1821. The first contingent of pupils were 11 boys and 19 girls as well as one school mistress. Hannal Wild taught there in 1833; in 1852 Ann Padley took over and stayed for 20 years. =Totley Grange= Totley Grange was a manor house near Totley's Cross Sythes pub. It was built in 1875 by Ebenezer Hall. He had bought the land from Mr. Parker who had bought it from George B. Greaves. Thomas Earnshaw, a fish and game dealer lived in the house around the 1890s which gave the house the nickname of Fish Villa. During the 1939 to 1945 war, some kind of electrical wiring work was carried out in The Grange by local women. In 1965, work begun on the construction of Totley Grange Estate. Workmen found well lining stones which from the findings could have held water sufficient to feed flora from large greenhouses and gardens. Sixty-five houses now lie on the estate of the former house. Totley Rise row of shops on Baslow Road Totley Brick Works on Baslow Road. Industry As a rural village the main industry has historically been agriculture, and several farms remain in Totley today. As well as agriculture, the brooks running through the village have been used as a source of power for small industrial operations since at least the 17th century. In particular, several mills have stood on Old Hay Brook, engaged in activities such as lead smelting, corn grinding, blade manufacture and paper rolling.Water Wheels on the River Sheaf in Abbeydale - Tilt Hammer The only industry still open is the Totley Brick Works on Baslow Road. This plant supplied the bricks for the construction of Totley Tunnel and currently produces heat-resistant bricks from materials mined outside of the area. .Construction of Totley Tunnel - Bradway Bugle References External links * Category:Suburbs of Sheffield Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District ","title":"Totley"},{"id":"1164892","text":"John Dorsey may refer to: *John Dorsey (American football) (born 1960), former American football player *John Dorsey is a pseudonym of voice actor, James Carter Cathcart *John Lloyd Dorsey Jr. (1891‚Äì1960), Representative from the U.S. state of Kentucky *John M.

Construction was begun in 1511 as a further residence for Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1478-1521), of Stafford Castle in Staffordshire. It is not a true military fortress but rather an early example of a Tudor country house, with minimal defensive attributes. It is now a grade I listed building. History The site was occupied by a manor house in 930; Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford & Earl of Pembroke, died in the Manor House in 1495. Part of the original plans for a very grand residence were \\"well advanced\\",Sir John Summerson, Architecture in Britain 1530-1830, 9th ed. 1993:23. with a Licence to crenellate being granted in 1508, before the 3rd Duke of Buckingham was beheaded for treason in 1521, by order of King Henry VIII. As at Richmond Palace in Surrey, the main ranges of Thornbury framed courts, of which the symmetrical entrance range, with central gatehouse and octagonal corner towers, survives, together with two less regular side ranges with many irregular projecting features and towers. Following the 3rd Duke's death Thornbury was confiscated by King Henry VIII of England, who stayed there for ten days in August 1535 with Queen Anne Boleyn.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 8, (1885), no. 989, the King's Gestes (advance plan) 5 July 1535; correspondence of Cromwell & his servants at Thornbury, vol. 9 (1886), nos. 114, 155, 124, 157. In 1554 Queen Mary granted the castle and manor to Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford. Following the Civil War, the castle fell into disrepair, but was renovated in 1824 by the Howard family. Today The castle is now a 26-room luxury hotel and restaurant, and a venue for weddings. Between 1966 and 1986 the castle was operated as one of the UK's top restaurants by Kenneth Bell MBE with staff including food writer Nigel Slater'Toast: The Story of a Boy's Hunger', Fourth Estate Ltd, (, 2003) or HarperPerennial (, 2004) and MasterChef New Zealand judge Simon Gault early in their culinary careers.

This is usually measured in bits, but sometimes in decimal digits. It is related to precision in mathematics, which describes the number of digits that are used to express a value. Some of the standardized precision formats are * Half-precision floating-point format * Single-precision floating-point format * Double-precision floating-point format * Quadruple-precision floating-point format * Octuple-precision floating-point format Of these, octuple-precision format is rarely used. The single- and double-precision formats are most widely used and supported on nearly all platforms. The use of half-precision format has been increasing especially in the field of machine learning since many machine learning algorithms are inherently error-tolerant. Rounding error Precision is often the source of rounding errors in computation. The number of bits used to store a number will often cause some loss of accuracy. An example would be to store \\"sin(0.1)\\" in IEEE single precision floating point standard. The error is then often magnified as subsequent computations are made using the data (although it can also be reduced).
