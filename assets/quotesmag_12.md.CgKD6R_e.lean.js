Acting as a passive reflector, In 1960, Echo relayed signals around of the earth, providing the first instantaneous worldwide communications. During the early Apollo landings Lunar Orbiter Program, Crabill was head of mission integration, responsible for the overall mission design. He also selected the original sites to be photographed on the moon. After the Lunar Orbiter program, the Viking Project made history when it became the first U.S. mission to land a spacecraft safely on the surface of Mars and return images of the surface, with Crabill serving as the Mission Analysis and Design Manager. After Viking, Crabill initiated a project to use airliner flight recorder magnetic tapes to derive statistical measurements. Crabill also developed and managed the Langley Storm Hazards Program. In this program, he researched the effects of heavy precipitation, wind shear, turbulence, and lightning on aircraft, and devised standards for the prediction, detection, operating procedures, and design criteria in response to these weather incidents.(n.d.) \\"NASA Lightning Strike Research\\", F-106 Delta Dart website.

The office held extraordinary authority and was of high distinction: he presided over the law school of the capital, Constantinople, was a member of the Byzantine Senate, held the seat next to the epi ton kriseon, and was accorded an annual salary (roga) of 4 pounds of gold and a silk tunic, not counting various imperial donations and gifts on holidays. The post's authority was further strengthened by precisely specifying the few cases in which an incumbent could be dismissed. The post did not long survive in its original conception, however, and quickly became associated with ecclesiastical law, enjoying, according to J. Darrouz√®s, an intermediate position between the civil and ecclesiastical administrations. Thus in the 12th century, it was held by several notable canonists, such as Alexios Aristenos, Neilos Doxapatres, and Theodore Balsamon. In the 14th century, there were both civil and ecclesiastical nomophylakes, with the latter analogous to another ecclesiastical judicial office, the dikaiophylax.

History The ship was built by Earle's Shipbuilding in Hull for the Great Eastern Railway and launched on 25 April 1900. She was launched by Miss Nellie Howard, daughter of Captain D. Howard, the Marine Superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway Company. She was built of steel and equipped with a double-ended hull, with two rudders adapted for steaming with equal facility astern or ahead.

Orikal Uno is one half of the hip- hop group OnePlusOne, which was founded with Alphonso Fleming Jr (DisputeOne). He is one half of the hip-hop group spellbound along with DJ Greenery. Orikal Uno is known as a visual artist; painting custom canvases for people via multiple platforms on the internet. He is also a notable music producer and audio engineer. In 2017, Minneapolis / St. Paul arts publication City Pages named Orikal Uno's self-produced single \\"Knockin\\" as the lead video of the Top 5 music videos of Minnesota. 2017 also saw the OnePlusOne song \\"Pelican\\" produced by Orikal Uno gain radio play on KZGO (GO 95.3 FM) Biography Orikal Uno was born Antonio Lorenzo Rosario in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on July 27, 1989. He is of Puerto Rican, European and Native-American descent. He graduated from St. Paul Open School in 2006. He has had a noticeable vocal conversational stutter since his early childhood. Although it is less prominent, it is still noticeable in conversation. He has quoted hip-hop and freestyle rapping as a way to finally be able to \\"speak fluently and clearly\\" as he can rap at a rapid-fire pace without a single hiccup or stutter. Before establishing himself as a musician, Rosario spent time studying the art and science of graffiti. Often the outcast among the local crews in the Twin Cities, he was forced to go out on his own and learn the ropes from the ground up. It was around this time that his love for hip-hop music led to Rosario starting to write rap songs with friends and on his own. Scraping up any sort of equipment he could, he had a makeshift recording setup that was responsible for 2 full-length releases (Under the name of Orikal), Unquestionable (2003) and Visions of Elevation (2004). These records were primarily produced by a producer he met on a Sage Francis internet forum by the name of Hiphopapotamus. Due to differences between the two, Hiphopapotamus and Orikal parted ways. Being left without beats, Orikal taught himself how to make instrumentals, starting out on Fruityloops and eventually landing on his current go-to program, Reason. He would go on to produce two more full-length albums: The Harsh Reality (2006) and Now What?! (2007) under the name \\"Orikal\\" Orikal founded Graff Roots Media in 2006 as a platform to release his own music and art. This has operated as his label and is still actively going today. The goal of the organization is to be able to do everything music, art and marketing related in-house. In 2008, Orikal decided to add \\"Uno\\" to his professional name. Partly as homage to his roots in graffiti, partly to reflect his Puerto Rican heritage, and partly to solidify a brand of his own without confusion. It was also this year that he was diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes and has been insulin-dependent ever since. At the end of the year, he traveled out to Los Angeles where he worked for Ron Sobel at North Star Media. It was around this time that Orikal started working with notable musician Maria Isa. They recorded various music, and digitally released a compilation of unheard music \\"Then and Now\\" in 2011. (bandcamp ref) In 2011, Orikal successfully launched a Kickstarter campaign with a target of $1500 to release his first official album as Orikal Uno, simply titled \\"Uno\\" and produced by long-time friend and frequent collaborator Anonimust (Kickstarter ref) Backers were rewarded with an autographed copy of the album as well as personalized stickers painted by Orikal. In 2012, Sab the Artist and Abstract Rude released The Awful Truth via Rhymesayers Entertainment in which Orikal Uno produced the title song. Orikal also released his full-length album \\"It Is What It Is\\" which was produced by frequent collaborator Chris Goodwin. This record also featured appearances by DisputeOne and Ganzobean Chris Goodwin and Orikal would then go on to release \\"Whatever Happens, Happens\\" in 2013. A darker album in comparison to \\"It Is What It Is,\\" this album featured notable appearances by Twin Cities emcees Kristoff Krane and Freez (of Illuminous 3) In 2014, DisputeOne introduced Orikal to producer Serebe, who is most notably the producer behind Eyedea's song Perfect Medicine - The duo linked up and released the full-length album \\"Sleepwalker\\", which features appearances by Glo Pesci, DisputeOne, Michelle Kearney, NL Emnt and DJ Elsewhere In 2015, Anonimust and Orikal teamed up once again to release the full-length album \\"Chasing Paradise\\", which would go on to score Orikal his first publishing deal. 2015 would see Orikal and DisputeOne get together to create their first full-length album and 12\\" vinyl record titled \\"OnePlusOne\\" - The duo first started working with each other in late 2011, going on to release the mixtape \\"Homework Volume 1\\" and delivering notable performances throughout the Twin Cities for the next year, including a sold-out show at the Fineline Music Cafe in which notable rapper Mac Lethal ordered the entire crowd pizza. As OnePlusOne, they had a busy 2016 with the release of their debut record \\"1+1\\". This release is Orikal Uno's first appearance on 12\\" vinyl, which was self- released through his label Graff Roots Media. 2016 also saw the debut of Orikal Uno and DJ Greenery as spellbound - a project which sees DJ Greenery on production and Orikal Uno on vocals and song arrangement. 2017 saw Orikal Uno release his upcoming self-produced LP \\"Tone Rosario\\" - Also notable is that he performed with DJ Greenery as spellbound at a sold out show held at legendary venue First Avenue's 7th St. Entry opening for hip-hop heavyweights Blackalicious in October 2017. Minneapolis publication City Pages deemed the music video for Orikal Uno's song Knockin #1 of a top 5 of music videos in July 2017. In January 2018, Orikal Uno released Come Back, the third collaborative effort with DJ Dixon DeVille (f/k/a Jayechs, Anonimust) on production. Uno is currently located in South Minneapolis and is said to be inspired by watching over Lake Street.

Instruction is in English. The co-educational school serves students in preschool through high school. Graduates earn a standard NIS diploma or an International Baccalaureate diploma. Nagoya International School was opened in 1964 partly in response to the demand for English-language instruction post World War II. The curriculum of Nagoya International School was initially based on the curriculum of American schools, but, over the years, the curriculum has been redesigned to be more international. The school is open to students of all backgrounds who can demonstrate the ability to succeed in an English-language school. Nagoya International School enrolled 496 students at the start of the 2017/2018 academic year at which time it had 54 full-time faculty members.  History  A school run by the American corporation Lockheed closed in 1963, precipitating a demand for a new international school that offered instruction in English for children of foreigners living in Japan. At that time, the only option for English-language instruction in the Nagoya area was the small and already crowded Apostolic Christian Academy, a Canadian school. David Smith, then the director of the Nagoya American Cultural Center, promoted the school and raised money for its launch from private and government sources. The United States State Department lent its support as did various businesses. The Aichi prefectural government was also an important early supporter. The school held its first classes for 84 students on September 8, 1964 in an abandoned building on loan from Nanzan Jr. High school. The student body represented seven different nations. Enrollment increased to 104 the following year. The school leaders negotiated the purchase of land belonging to sixteen rice farmers in Moriyama-ku. Then Antonin Raymond, who studied under Frank Lloyd Wright, was hired to design a dedicated school building. Construction kicked off in 1967. In 1968, the school held its first graduation. Enrollment climbed to 313 students in the 1970s but declined steeply in the 1980s. Headmaster Don Bergman believed the school would not survive using its current model of enrolling only foreign students, and Nagoya International School opened its doors to Japanese students. Enrollment increased, stabilizing at 400. Following the Great Hanshin earthquake, the school's gym was deemed unsafe, and a new gym and classroom building was built. The new Wing Building was opened in 1999. Charles Barton served as NIS headmaster from 1993-2007. During Barton‚Äôs tenure, the school grew and new facilities were added. The Charles Barton Memorial Garden is named in his memory. The current Head of School, Matthew Parr, also serves as the President of the Japan Council of International Schools. Curriculum Nagoya International School offers four programs: preschool and kindergarten; elementary school, middle school, and high school. The curriculum is built around five essential elements of learning: knowledge, concepts, skills, attitudes and action. The preschool and kindergarten serves students ages 3‚Äì5, and curriculum is based on the Reggio Emilia approach. The elementary school serves students ages 6‚Äì10. The middle school serves students 11 through 14 and the high school serves students ages 15 through 18. Student life Nagoya International School's team mascot is the dolphin. The school has boys' volleyball, basketball, baseball, and soccer; girls' volleyball, basketball, soccer, and softball as well as co-educational tennis and badminton teams. The school offers numerous classes in theater, art, and music. In 2014, the school implemented a student council to allow students a voice in school management. Community service Nagoya International School is substantially involved in the Nagoya community. The school sponsors the annual Nagoya Walkathon. Students participate in a number of charitable endeavors include tutoring and building houses for people in the Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Students have twice assisted relief efforts in Tohoku. NIS also hosts a chapter of the Red Cross. The NIS Junior Red Cross teaches students to administer first aid and CPR and also to communicate in American Sign language. Facilities NIS facilities consist of five instructional buildings, a sports field, field house, playgrounds, and eight acres of open, park-like space. The school has a gym and a culture center as well as classrooms. As of 2017, a further expansion of the school is being considered. Finances As of 2016, 95 percent of Nagoya International School's funding comes from tuition and fees. The remainder is gifts and income from endowments.

His mother was Jelena Jak≈°iƒá, of the Serbian Jak≈°iƒá noble family, who had previously been married to Jovan Brankoviƒá, the last Serbian Despot of the Brankoviƒá dynasty (1496‚Äì1502), who died in 1502; as the couple had no male issue, the Serbian Despot title remained vacant. When Jelena remarried to Ivani≈° in 1504, he received the title, holding it until his death in 1514. Stefan was less than ten years old when his father died, thus, the Despot title was granted to him only in 1520. After the fall of Belgrade in 1521, he tried to hold his fortress of Kupinik in Syrmia county, but the region was eventually lost to Ottoman invasion. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Moh√°cs (1526), the Hungarian nobility was divided into two sides; one led by King Ferdinand Habsburg, while the other was led by John Z√°polya, the Duke of Transylvania, who was also proclaimed King. Since Stefan Berislaviƒá supported Ferdinand, Zapolja decided to appoint Radiƒç Bo≈æiƒá as titular Despot of Serbia (1527‚Äì1528). Stefan continued to act as Serbian Despot, until his death in 1535.

Early years Fernand Chapsal was born on 10 March 1862 in Limoges, Haute-Vienne. His family moved to Saintes, Charente-Maritime when his father was appointed principal of the college there. Chapsal obtained his secondary education in the Saintes college, then studied at the Faculty of Paris and became a Doctor of Law. Soon after he was appointed to the Audit Court of the Council of State. He was in turn an Auditor, Master of Requests and Deputy-Commissioner to the Government for litigation. He published a treatise of the procedure before the Prefecture Councils. Chapsal was chief of staff of Louis Ricard, Minister of Justice in 1892 and 1898, and of Georges Trouillot, Minister of the Colonies in 1898. He also taught at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Ecole des Sciences Politiques de Paris) and at the National Institute of Agronomy. He promoted the Mutual Credit of Agriculture (Cr√©dit mutuel agricole). He was a member and then president of the French Exhibitions Committee, and was commissioner general of several of these events, including those of Li√®ge (1905), Brussels (1910) and Berlin (1912).

As of May 1915 Chapsal was a member of the inter- ministerial Comit√© de restriction des approvisionnements et du commerce de l'ennemi, which looked into economic warfare possibilities. In 1916 Chapsal became interested in the possibility of obtaining meat from the neutral Netherlands. However, despite the advantage to France and corresponding loss to Germany, it was too late. All supplies had by now been committed to the British or Germans. For the results he achieved in the difficult civil supplies job Chapsal was given the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour in 1919. Political career In 1919 Chapsal was elected mayor of Saintes and councilor-general of Charente-Inf√©rieure. On 17 July 1921 he was elected senator for Charente-Inf√©rieure in a by-election following the death of √âmile Combes. He joined the Democratic Left. He was a member of the Customs Committee until 1937, and was president of the committee from 1926. He was particularly interested in questions of agriculture and economics. He was Minister of Commerce and Industry from 23 June 1926 to 15 July 1926 in the cabinet of Aristide Briand. In August 1926 he was appointed French delegate to the Reparations Commission, replacing Louis Barthou. Chapsal was reelected to the senate on 14 January 1930. In January 1937 he was elected vice-president of the senate. He was Minister of Commerce from 22 June 1937 to 18 January 1938 in the 3rd cabinet of Camille Chautemps. He was Minister of Agriculture from 18 January 1938 to 13 March 1938 in the 4th cabinet of Camille Chautemps. He was reelected to the senate on 10 January 1939. Monument to Chapsal in the public garden in Saintes Fernand Chapsal died on 10 February 1939 in Neuilly, Seine.

It was released on October 31, 2015. Southeast Asian anime distributor ODEX began to release the film in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines between January and February 2016. Plot On the day of his graduation from middle school the extremely tall, gorilla like boy Takeo Goda attempts to confess his love to his crush, Kagami, but Kagami instead confesses her love to Takeo's best friend and next door neighbour, the handsome and popular Sunakawa \\"Suna\\" Makoto, who promptly turns her down. On the first day in high school every girl is in love with Suna and most of the boys are jealous, except for Takeo, who knows Suna has no feelings for any of them. Suna and Takeo see a girl from another high school being harassed by a molester. Takeo confronts the molester who flees. Takeo sees the girl is crying and, assuming she is scared of him, hurriedly apologises and leaves but the girl follows and thanks him for saving her. Takeo instantly falls in love with her. Takeo promises to help the Karate club win their championship match. The girl, who had also fallen in love with Takeo, plans to ask him if he has a girlfriend, though when her friends see Takeo with Suna, they automatically assume that the cooler Suna is Takeo and that Takeo must be his older relative. She introduces herself to Takeo as Rinko Yamato and gives Takeo and Suna a cheesecake she baked as a thank you, which Takeo finds delicious. Takeo believes Rinko has fallen in love with Suna and promises to bring Suna to meet her again. Takeo tries to find the type of girl Suna likes. Suna admits he has never met a truly nice girl. Takeo concludes that as Rinko is a nice person, Suna must like her. Takeo is surprised when Rinko asks if she can call him by his first name. Takeo spends his time training with the Karate club while attempting to bring Suna and Rinko together. Rinko makes more difficult and elaborate sweets hoping to impress Takeo. Suna leaves Takeo and Rinko alone and Takeo tells her stories of their childhood together. Suna admits Rinko may be the first nice girl he has ever met, furthering Takeo's assumption that Suna likes her. After Takeo easily wins the Karate championship Rinko gives him his favourite pork miso onigiri as a reward. When Takeo tells Rinko she should date Suna she runs away. Rinko believes that Takeo sees her as a nuisance and hates her. Suna assures her Takeo has never hated anybody. Rinko admits she is in love with Takeo. Rinko invites Takeo and Suna on a group date to an amusement park where her friends meet Takeo for the first time. They immediately criticise him behind his back but Rinko defends Takeo who she thinks is cool. In the Haunted House Suna almost tells Takeo that Rinko likes him when Takeo realises the attraction is on fire. Trapped by the fire, Takeo breaks through the wall to let people escape. A falling coffin almost hurts Rinko but Takeo manages to stop it. Rinko tries to help Takeo and, spurred on by her smile, he manages to throw the coffin by himself and they escape. Suna admits he never had a girlfriend because every girl who confessed to him had insulted Takeo behind his back, whereas Rinko only says nice things. Rinko's friends admit Takeo is cool. Takeo's previous crush, Kagami, works at the theme park, and when she asks if Rinko is his girlfriend Takeo states that such a thing would be impossible, upsetting Rinko. A depressed Takeo starts performing poorly in sports, while a similarly depressed Rinko bakes numerous cakes nonstop. She learns that Takeo had a crush on Kagami. Takeo meets with Rinko to buy a present for Suna's birthday. Awkward at first they end up enjoying the trip but when they talk about who they both like, Takeo assumes Rinko is talking about Suna, while Rinko thinks Takeo still likes Kagami. They end up promising to help each other with their future relationships. After Suna overhears Takeo talking with his father about love he hatches a plan. On his birthday Suna tells Takeo Rinko is crying at a bakery when she is actually at home with her friends. Takeo rushes to find her and eventually realises Rinko is not at the bakery, but she had asked the owner to teach her how to make a cake she once gave to him. Following several messages from Suna, Takeo travels to other bakeries and sweet shops, each of which Rinko had visited to learn how to make all the cakes and sweets she gave to him, including the shop where Takeo's mother works to learn how to cook his favourite pork miso onigiri. She had written every recipe in a notebook, including notes on which food Takeo liked best, which Takeo's mother remembered she used to do when she first fell in love with Takeo's father. Takeo slowly realises Rinko had actually liked him the whole time, and with some encouragement from Suna, runs to Rinko's house. Rinko hears Takeo shouting and rushes to meet him and they finally confess they love each other. To thank Suna for his help they throw a birthday party for him with a cake baked by Rinko. Suna ends up laughing hysterically at how similar Takeo and Rinko's personalities are now they are dating. In an after credits scene in Suna's bedroom Takeo admits that he managed to mess up on holding Rinko's hand for the first time and is worried he will also mess up their first kiss. To keep that from happening he insists on practising kissing with Suna.

The miracle of Saint Mary  Once upon a time in the 12th century, a knight named Don Ero lived with his wife in his palace in Armenteira, a beautiful natural setting located in the slopes of Mount Castrove, in the Province of Pontevedra (Galicia, Spain). Don Ero and his wife were not able to have children, so they kept asking God to send them some descendants. God answered their prayers with the revelation that they would only have spiritual descent. For this reason they decided to found their own monasteries. Don Ero founded Santa Mar√≠a de Armenteira, right there in his lands. He requested help from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercian order, who sent him four monks to start the monastery. Years later, he became the abbot of the monastery himself. Ero the Abbot was always begging the Virgin Mary to show him just a little vision of what the divine grace would be like. He longed for the day when he would be able to understand the concept of paradise bliss, however he lived under the impression that his beloved Virgin did not listen to his prayers. One day, he decided to go for a walk around the woods that surrounded the monastery, a beautiful setting full of pine trees, oaks and other native species. He took a rest and sat on a stone. Suddenly, the joyous chirp of a bird caught his attention. He sat there for a while, listening, entranced by the peace and beauty that the bird's singing brought to his soul. Not long after that, he headed back to his monastery, since it was already getting dark and he did not want his brethren to worry about him. When he knocked at the door of the monastery, he was received by a monk completely unknown to him. Distrustful, the monk asked him who he was. When he answered him that he was the abbot Ero, the monk, bewildered, started to call his brothers, not sure if the man was in his right mind. Ero told them who he was and what he had been doing. When the brethren explained what year they were in, Ero realized to his astonishment that three hundred years had passed by! And suddenly, he became aware that what he thought to have been only three minutes listening to a bird sing, had really been three hundred years contemplating the glory of paradise. Virgin Mary had finally granted him his wish. Popularity of the legend This legend, related to others of similar content related to the Celtic tradition, became really popular in the 13th century when the King Alfonso X the Wise included it in his famous Cantigas de Santa Maria, a recompilation of miracles attributed to Virgin Mary. He dedicated his cantiga (poem or song) number 103 to the legend of Saint Ero. The great Galician writer Ram√≥n Mar√≠a del Valle Incl√°n also contributed to spreading the legend by including it in his work ‚ÄúAromas de Leyenda‚Äù (1907), a collection of 14 poems inspired in several Galician traits like scenery, traditions and superstitions.

Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of CBPS typically appear in infancy or at birth, but can appear later in childhood. These include facial diplegia (paralysis on both sides), facial muscle spasms, pseudobulbar palsy, dysarthria (difficulty speaking), difficulty chewing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Epileptic seizures in individuals with CBPS are different between individuals and can vary between episodes.  Pathophysiology  Though the underlying cause of CBPS is unknown, it is thought to arise from improper migration of neuroblasts (neuronal stem cells) to the cerebral cortex in the embryonic brain. This causes the layers of the cerebral cortex to not form properly, and too many small folds (gyri) to form on the surface of the brain. This condition is called bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. The sulci, deep grooves on the brain, may also not form correctly. Cranial nerves are affected and cause muscle paralysis and spasms in the face and throat.  Diagnosis  Several disorders may appear similar to CBPS and need to be distinguished in the process of diagnosing CBPS. These include pachygyria, double cortex syndrome, and lissencephaly, all of which are classified along with CBPS as neuronal migration disorders. Diagnostic tests for CBPS include electroencephalograms, CT scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging.  Treatment  CBPS is commonly treated with anticonvulsant therapy to reduce seizures. Therapies include anticonvulsant drugs, adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, and surgical therapy, including focal corticectomy and callosotomy. Special education, speech therapy, and physical therapy are also used to help children with intellectual disability due to CBPS.  Epidemiology  Males and females have an equal chance of having CBPS.

Set in the rural American West, a small-town orphanage struggles to become self-supporting through its 4-H Club projects. The screenplay, written by Dorrell McGowan and Stuart E. McGowan, is based on a story concept by Robert T. Shannon. Released 6 October 1940, the film stars Mary Lee, Harry Cheshire, Rufe Davis, June Storey, Ralph Bowman, Joan Woodbury, Jed Prouty, Victor Kilian, and Isabel Randolph. Plot Pappy Cheshire, his assistant Louise Dale, and farmhand Bucksaw Beechwood manage an orphanage near the village of Farmdale. Pappy has loaned $5000 of community provided orphanage funding to the orphans for their new 4-H Club projects so the orphanage will become self-supporting. Of the opinion this is a ridiculous idea, community leaders Hiram Crabtree, Sam Spitz, and Mrs. Uppington pressure Pappy to return the money within 30 days. Hearing on the radio that Pappy's long lost brother, Henry, died and left Pappy $20,000, Bubbles Martin, one of the teenage orphan girls, tells Pappy about his good fortune, part of which turns out to be a nightclub, The Peep Inn, that Pappy and Bubbles visit in the city. Pappy plans to close the place, sell the building, and use the proceeds for the orphanage. He approaches The Peep Inn's group of musicians, girl dancers, and their director, Jeff Hill, to settle their contract at 50 cents on the dollar for their release. The entertainers refuse the offer and Pappy insists they get on the train and come to Farmdale to work for him for the remainder of their contract. When Jeff Hill and troupe arrive at the orphanage, Jeff is immediately smitten with Louise but she gives him the cold shoulder. Receiving a check for only $900 from his brother's estate after taxes and expenses, Pappy is unable to pay the community back. Jeff wants to put on a show, \\"The Barnyard Follies\\", to earn enough money to solve the financial problem but Dolly and the other girl dancers quit when they learn of the plan. Bubbles gets the orphans to do the show with the help of Jeff. The Fire Inspector prevents the show from taking place. Under the pressure of Hiram and Sam, Pappy Cheshire leaves the orphanage. When the haystack goes up in flames the Fire Department comes. As the Fire Department begins to leave, one of the fire trucks gets stuck on the bridge in the driveway at the orphanage. With the entire Fire Department now at the orphanage waiting for the fire truck to be freed, the Mayor of Farmdale allows the show to proceed. Pappy returns when he hears on the radio that the orphan's 4-H Club animals are going to be auctioned off.

Mary Lee's second screen appearance came in late 1939 in South of the Border at Republic Pictures where she went on to appear in a total of 21 films, including nine Gene Autry films, two Roy Rogers films, seven other feature films, and three shorts. In her first five Autry films she appeared as \\"Patsy\\", the younger sister of June Storey's character. However, Barnyard Follies would be Mary Lee's last screen appearance with June Storey who began to diversify into other film genres. Mary Lee's last screen appearance was with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in Republic Pictures' Song of Nevada (5 August 1944) after which she did some further work with Ted Weems. In her first screen appearance, eleven year old Norma Jean Wooters (uncredited) as one of the orphan girls is first seen at 19:40 where she greets Pappy Cheshire as he walks into the barn, pats her on the head, and says \\"Hello Honey\\". Next, she is found in the haystack scene with Bucksaw (Rufe Davis). Also visible in other scenes, she is eventually identified at 40:34 as \\"Buckshot\\" by Jeff Hill (Ralph Bowman).

Norma Jean was the younger sister of Mary Lee Wooters. Rufe Davis appeared in 14 of the Three Mesquiteers series films at Republic Pictures during the early 1940s. He took his comedy act on tour with the Gene Autry road show during the late 1940s into the 1950s and from 1963 through early 1970 was a regular cast member in the CBS television series Petticoat Junction. Active in 4-H and the 1940 Wisconsin Dairy Queen, Dorothy Harrison was from Oregon, Wisconsin. Where she is seen cranking the cream separator at 3:06, on the wall to the right of the door is a poster that says \\"VOTE FOR DOROTHY HARRISON - OUR 4H CLUB CANDIDATE FOR QUEEN OF DAIRYLAND\\". In the Big Boy Blues scene Dorothy Harrison is seen twirling her baton and riding on the haywagon. Beginning in 1936, Mary Jane and Carolyn DeZurik appeared regularly in Chicago on the WLS National Barn Dance radio program under contract as The DeZurik Sisters. In late 1938, they recorded six sides for the American Record Corporation which issued on the Conqueror and Vocalion record labels as the DeZurik Sisters.Abrams, Steven and Tyrone Settlemier, The Online Discographical Project, DeZurik Sisters, Conqueror 9251, 9252, 9253,Abrams, Steven and Tyrone Settlemier, The Online Discographical Project, DeZurik Sisters, Vocalion 4616, 4704, 4781, On the Purina Mills Checkerboard Time radio show, in Barnyard Follies, at the WSM Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, and elsewhere they were known as The Cackle Sisters.

Seen with the basket of laundry in Barnyard follies, Lillian Randolph (uncredited) also appeared in the opening scene at 3:25. Born Castello Randolph in 1898, she came to Hollywood in 1934 from WXYZ radio Detroit and enjoyed a long career in motion pictures, radio, and television as a character actor. The role of the Mayor of Farmdale is played by actor and writer Robert McKenzie (uncredited) who appeared in more than 300 films. Married to actress Eva Heazlitt McKenzie, their two daughters and a niece were also actors. We remember their youngest daughter Fay McKenzie as the leading lady in five Gene Autry films from October 1941 through April 1942.IMDb, Robert McKenzie, Biography, Western Clippings, Mike Fitzgerald, An Interview with Fay McKenzie, Barnyard Follies drew on cast members who had been recently dropped from Hal Roach's Our Gang series of comedy shorts. Most prominent in the film was Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer where he demonstrates his ability to yodel off-key. Darwood Kaye (uncredited), known for his role of Waldo from 1937 into 1940 in the Our Gang series, is identified as \\"Waldo\\" by Pappy Cheshire (Harry Cheshire) at 4:50. He is found in a number of scenes in Barnyard Follies with his trademark large, round, black horn-rimmed spectacles.

Barnyard Follies at 3:19 - Lucenay's Peter and unidentified boy. (Click on the image to enlarge.) The dog, Lucenay's Peter (uncredited), seen in Barnyard Follies was the second generation \\"Pete the Pup\\" from Hal Roach's Our Gang series and is identified in the haystack scene at 25:25 as \\"Pete\\" by Bubbles (Mary Lee). Born 6 September 1929, owned and trained by Harry S. Lucenay (1887-1944), Lucenay's Peter was AKC and UKC registered as an American Pit Bull TerrierLucenay's Peter, UKC 022-558, APBT-Online, and had a ring painted around his left eye. Lucenay's first generation \\"Pete the Pup\\", named Pal the Wonder Dog, with a natural ring around his right eye, debuted as \\"Tige\\" in 1925 in the Buster Brown two-reeler series, later moving to the Our Gang series, and died in 1930 of apparent poisoning. With the loss of Pal the Wonder Dog, Lucenay's Peter debuted in Pups is Pups (1930). His last Our Gang appearance was in The Pooch (1932) after which time various other unrelated dogs were used in the series as a result of Lucenay and Roach having parted ways. Lucenary's Peter died of old age in 1946. Theodore Lucenay (1925-2004), son of Harry, remembered Pete in an interview in 2001 for the Waco Tribune-Herald: \\"He was a gentle, playful and warm dog. He would sleep at the foot of my bed. He was just the regular family dog. I really miss him.\\"Minor, Christina, \\"Pooch Pete still alive to fans of Our Gang\\", Waco Tribune-Herald, Waco, Texas, 9 April 2001, (Click on the link and scroll down the page to view the article by Christina Minor.

In this modern-day retelling, the two iconic rascals are grown up and small-time crooks still searching for the fabled Murrell's treasure that has eluded them since childhood. The story draws heavily from Twain's classic novels, including characters, plot twists and even dialogue.  Plot  When Huck Finn (Kyle Gallner) is released from jail he is greeted by his lifelong friend, Tom Sawyer (Adam Nee), now an underachieving cop who just can't let go of their childhood dreams of wealth and glory. Tom convinces the reluctant Huck and their bumbling friends Joe Harper (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Ben Rogers (Hannibal Buress) to rob a pawnshop where their friend and contact, the alcoholic vagrant Muff Potter (Cooper Huckabee), believes Injun Joe (Stephen Lang), a savage and murderous white career criminal who admires and appropriates Native American culture, has hidden Murrell's treasure. Tom explains that robbing bad guys makes them the good guys. Things get complicated when Tom's commander assigns him to train Becky Thatcher (Melissa Benoist), an eager-to-please rookie partner, and the hung-over band of robbers' heist goes awry. But that doesn't stop Tom; instead, he leads the band on a wild treasure hunt from one mysterious clue to another. When Huck's friend, Mexican day laborer Jorge Jimenez (Daniel Edward Mora), is mistaken as part of the band's activities and arrested, Huck and Tom, on the run from a vengeful Injun Joe and the police, lead the band on a mission to rescue him and be \\"heroes\\".

Professional pilots can experience stress in flight, on the ground during work-related activities, and during personal time because of the influence of their occupation.Harris, Don, Professor. (2012). Human Performance on the Flight Deck. Ashgate. Retrieved 1 December 2015, from <http://www.myilibrary.com?ID=317410> An airline pilot can be an extremely stressful job due to the workload, responsibilities and safety of the thousands of passengers they transport around the world. Chronic levels of stress can negatively impact one's health, job performance and cognitive functioning. Being exposed to stress does not always negatively influence humans because it can motivate people to improve and help them adapt to a new environment. Unfortunate accidents start to occur when a pilot is under excessive stress, as it dramatically affects his or her physical, emotional, and mental conditions. Stress \\"jeopardizes decision-making relevance and cognitive functioning\\" and it is a prominent cause of pilot error. Being a pilot is considered a unique job that requires managing high workloads and good psychological and physical health. Unlike the other professional jobs, pilots are considered to be highly affected by stress levels. One study states that 70% of surgeons agreed that stress and fatigue don't impact their performance level, while only 26% of pilots denied that stress influences their performance. Pilots themselves realize how powerful stress can be, and yet many accidents and incidents continues to occur and have occurred, such as Asiana Airlines Flight 214, American Airlines Flight 1420, and Polish Air Force Tu-154.  Aviation accidents caused by stress  Asiana Airlines Flight 214 tail wreckage due to the crash Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was one of many tragic accidents triggered by stress. It occurred on July 6, 2013 on the aircraft's final approach to San Francisco International Airport from Incheon International Airport. During its approach, the plane hit the edge of the runway and its tail came apart followed by the fuselage bursting into flames. The trainee pilot flying was \\"stressed about the approach to the unfamiliar airport and thought the autothrottle was working before the jet came in too low and too slow.\\" He believed that the autothrottle, which is designed to maintain speed, was always on. The trainee pilot should have had full understanding of his flight systems and high mode awareness, but he didn't. He told National Transportation Safety Board that he should have studied more. His inefficient knowledge of the flight deck automation and an unfamiliar airport structure caused excessive stress, and the aftermath was disastrous: three passengers died and more than 187 passengers were injured. Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash site American Airlines Flight 1420 took place on June 1, 1999. The pilot was Captain Richard Buschmann, considered an expert pilot with over ten thousand hours of flight time. The First Officer was Michael Origel with under five thousand hours of flight time. The flight was set to land at the airport in Arkansas but a major thunderstorm was occurring in the area and Captain Buschmann decided to change runways due to the high crosswind and rapid change wind direction. The pilots were overcome with tasks and the stress of the difficult landing, forgetting to arm the automatic ground spoiler and ground braking systems. It was too difficult to recover the aircraft and it slid off the runway and collided with a large steel walkway, resulting in the death of Captain Bucshmann and 10 passengers, with many suffering from severe injuries. Another example is the Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash of April 2010, which killed Polish president Lech Kaczynski. During landing, the pilot Captain Arkadiusz Protasiuk was having difficulty landing due to severely foggy conditions, but the number of high-status passengers and priority of arriving on time pressured him onwards. Captain Protasiuk brought the aircraft down through the clouds at too low of an altitude, resulting in a controlled flight into terrain. His attempt to land failed and the plane crashed into a forest, killing the crew and all the passengers. Further study by the Interstate Aviation Committee regarding the cockpits voice recordings revealed that there was never a direct command for the pilot to go through with the landing, but the report did show that the pilot was under a \\"cascade of stress much of it emanating from his powerful passengers, as Captain Protasiuk slipped below the decision altitude\\". This accident led to the death of 96 people, all due to the high amount of stress being put on the pilot, affecting his mental state, inhibiting him from doing his job. = Advances In cockpit technology = From the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 study, Kathy Abbott of the Federal Aviation Administration stated that \\"the data suggests that the highly integrated nature of current flight decks and additional add-on features have increased flight crew knowledge and introduced complexity that sometimes results in pilot confusion and errors during flight deck operation.\\" U.S. investigators instructed the manufactures to fix Boeing 777's complex control systems because pilots \\"no longer fully understand\\" how aircraft systems works. As technology advances, more and more new instruments are put into the cockpit panel. As these increase, cognitive demands also increase, and pilots are becoming distracted from their primary tasks. Although having various types of information enhances situation awareness, it also overloads sensory channels. Since human's cognitive loads are limited, information overloads only increase the risk of flight accidents. Pilots have more difficulty perceiving and processing the data when information are overwhelming.  Effects on memory  Model of working memory There are three components of memory: long-term, short-term, and working memory. When stress kicks in, a pilot's working memory is impaired. Stress either limits the amount of resources that can be accessed through working memory or the time which these sources can be accessed are inhibited. When a pilot feels stressed, he or she will notice an increase in heart rate, higher blood pressure, muscle tensions, anxiety and fatigue. These physiological stress symptoms eventually interrupt the pilot's cognitive functions by reducing his or her memory capacity and restraining cue samples. Through a study researchers found that stress greatly affects flight performances including, smoothness and accuracy of landing, ability to multi-task, and being ahead of the plane. Further research shows that under high stress, people are likely to make the same decision he or she has previously made, whether or not it led to a positive or a negative consequence before.  Causes of stress  Stress can be caused by environmental, physiological, or psychological factors. Environmental stress can be caused by loud noise, small cockpit space, temperature, or any factors affecting one physically via one's current surroundings. Unpleasant environments can raise one's stress level. Physiological stress is a physical change due to influence of fatigue, anxiety, hunger, or any factors that may change a pilot's biological rhythms. Lastly, psychological factors include personal issues, including experiences, mental health, relationships and any other emotional issues a pilot may face. All these stressors interfere with cognitive activity and limit a pilot's ability to achieve peak performance. It is important to minimize these possible sources of stress to maximize pilots' cognitive loads, which affects their perception, memory, and logical reasoning.  Stress in flight  thumb227x227px Yerkes‚ÄìDodson law shows that too low or too high arousal results in low performance Researchers found that improvements in technology have significantly reduced aviation accidents, but human error still endangers flight safety. An individual reacts to stress in different ways, depending on how one perceives stress. If an individual judges that he or she has resources to cope with demands of the situation, it will be evaluated as a challenge. On the other hand, if an individual believes situational demands outweigh the resources, he or she will evaluate it as a threat, leading to poorer performance. Under the threat response, researchers stated that pilots became more distracted with their controls and had higher tendencies to scan unnecessary instruments. Plan Continuation Error (PCE) is one of the types of decision-making error pilot conducts. PCE is defined as an \\"erroneous behavior due to failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe.\\" The French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA) stated that 41.5% of casualties in general aviation were caused by get- home-itis syndrome; which happens when a pilot intents to land at the planned destination, no matter what it takes. A pilot must use their own judgment to go-around whenever it is necessary, but he or she often fails to do so. Through the study, it was found that mental workload of stress and heart rate increases when making go-around decisions. A pilot feels pressured and stressed by the obligation to get passengers to their destinations at the right time and to continue the flight as planned. When choosing between productivity and safety, pilots' risk assessments can be influenced unconsciously. American Airlines Flight 1420 accidents was one example caused by PCE; although the flight crew knew it was dangerous to continue the flight as severe thunderstorms were approaching, they continued on with their flight. = Positive and negative views of stress = Stress can narrow the focus of attention in a good way and in a bad way. Stress helps to simplify a pilot's task and enables him or her to focus on major issues by eliminating nonessential information. In other words, a pilot can simplify information and react accordingly to major cues only. However, when a pilot exceeds his or her cognitive load, it will eventually narrow his or her attention too much and cause inattention deafness. The pilot will mainly focus on doing the primary task and ignore secondary tasks, such as audible alarms and spoken instructions.  Military pilot stress  Military pilots experience a more fast-paced and stressful career compared to airline and general aviation pilots. Military pilots experience significantly greater stress levels due to significant reliability and performance expectations. They hold a unique position in the workforce that includes peak physical and mental condition, high intelligence and extensive training. All military pilots, at times, must work under extreme conditions, experiencing high levels of stress, especially in a war zone. Soldiers are made to endure punishment and go through the most unthinkable situations. They are expected to continue with their job and at times completely ignore their own emotions. After initial training, the military completely reforms the individual, and in most cases incredible stress management skills are formed. The soldier is then sent off for further training, in this case to be a pilot, where they are tested and challenge even further to either fail or become one of the best. Military pilots hold a lot of responsibility. Their jobs can include passenger or cargo transport, reconnaissance missions, or attacking from the air or flight training, all while expected to be in perfect mental and physical condition. These jobs place a responsibility on the pilot to avoid mistakes as millions of dollars, lives, or whole operations are at risk. At times stress does over take the pilot and emotions and human error can occur. 240x240px There are countless occurrences of pilots bombing allied forces in friendly fire incidents out of error and having to live with the consequences. The stress of the job itself or of any mistake made can hugely affect one's life outside work. Millions of veterans struggle with post-traumatic stress injuries, unhealthy coping strategies such as alcohol or substance abuse and in the worst of cases, suicide, which is very common. Many studies and help programs have been put in place, but there are many different cases and people that it is impossible to help everyone. Stress overcomes even the strongest, most highly training pilots and can take the worst toll. Everyone deals with stress in a different manner, but military pilots stand out on their own with unique stress reducing and problem solving skills. Their main strategy is to find the problem causing the stress and solve it immediately so that they do not have to move to a secondary option, which consumes time they do not have. This is what they are taught in flight school; a sensor goes off and they immediately fix the problem. The main problem appears when pilots are going high speed or undergoing complicated maneuvers. Most times they are moving much faster than a human could even think, leaving a lot of room for human error. When that error occurs, however big or small, they can take on immense guilt for any problems that were caused depending on their personality. This can affect their mental state and ability to continue their job. Stress can also take a physical toll on a pilot's body, such as grinding of their teeth in difficult situations or even bladder problems when the pilot is flying with a higher G-force or for a long distance.  Improvements through crew resource management  After the 1950s, human error became the main cause of aviation accidents. Stress and fatigue continues to be an issue in the aviation industry. Hence, various training are being conducted to minimize it. The change began as National Aeronautics and Space Administration pointed out human limitations and emphasized the importance of teamwork. Crew Resource Management is a type of training conducted to teach a flight crew different behavioral strategies, such as situational awareness, stress management, and decision-making. When pilots are being hired, recruiters not only look at pilots' technical skills, but also at pilots' ability to learn from errors and evaluate how well they coordinate with other crew members.

Characteristics  Granadaene contains a conjugated system made up of a linear chain of 12 conjugated double bonds which is connected to the amino acid ornithine at one end and the sugar rhamnose at the other. Granadaene is dark red, odorless, insoluble in water, methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, acetone, hexane, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and in most solvents, it is soluble in DMSO‚Äì0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Granadaene, can be extracted from cultures of S.agalactiae in granada broth (granada medium without agar) with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) and purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex LH using DMSO‚Äì0.1%TFA. Streptococcus agalactiae in granada broth Ultraviolet/visible spectrum of granadaene, in DMSO+TFA Proposed metabolic pathway for granadaene biosynthesis The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of the granadaene (in DMSO/TFA) is almost identical to that of a carotene with a similar conjugated system of double bonds (e.g. alpha- carotene), that is why the GBS pigment was considered to be a carotene for many years. Biological relevance  Granadaene is an organic compound produced by S.agalactiae. It is the product of a metabolic pathway similar to that of biosynthesis of fatty acids. The enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of granadaene in GBS are coded by a gene cluster of 12 genes, the cyl operon, and a pathway for the pigment biosynthesis requiring all the genes of the cyl operon has been proposed. Like the biosynthesis of the pigment, the hemolytic activity requires also in GBS the 12 genes of the cyl operon. The pigment is localized, in GBS, in the cell membrane, where it could play a role in membrane stabilization, similarly to the role of carotenes in other bacterial membranes. It has also been proposed that granadaene is indeed the hemolysin of S.agalactiae, and because the GBS hemolysin is a broad-spectrum cytolysin able to destroy many eukaryotic cells, it is considered an important virulence factor for GBS. Production of the red pigment granadaene is a phenotypic trait specific to Œ≤-hemolytic GBS, and because of that, detection of red colonies from clinical samples, when cultivated on granada medium, allows the straightforward identification of GBS. In addition to S.agalactiae the presence of granadaene has been reported in Propionibacterium jensenii, where it can cause defects such as red spots in some cheeses. Probably granadaene is also present in other Propionibacterium sp. such as P.thoenii and P.rubrum.

He first appeared in the series fifteen episode \\"Blood Ties\\", broadcast on 2 January 2013. Arthur arrives at Holby City hospital to start his first year of the Foundation Programme. To prepare for the role Ostlere visited a hospital and shadowed a registrar and foundation doctors on their rounds. He has been described by Holby City's publicity department as \\"na√Øve and socially awkward\\" plus holding an \\"encyclopaedic knowledge\\" on unusual subjects. Ostlere's first days on-set influenced various aspects of Arthur's characterisation such as his \\"preppy attire\\", fidgeting with his glasses and his clumsy nature. Arthur is a talented doctor and his skills are awarded the medical prize titled, Junior Doctor of the Year. Arthur's storylines have focused on his career on the hospital's Keller and AAU wards, alongside the various characters that staff them. In his first year on-screen he works closely with mentor Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) and staff nurse Chantelle Lane (Lauren Drummond). The latter he develops romantic feelings for which are not reciprocated. Their friendship dominates his initial story and together they become victims of a vicious mugging and a car crash which is caused by Arthur. His second year saw him working alongside F1 doctors Dominic Copeland (David Ames) and Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) while remaining on Keller. This trio dynamic proved popular with viewers and producers made the difficult decision to split them up. The move was labelled as an attempt to reflect reality as Junior Doctors generally progress to different wards and specialities. Arthur began his CT1 training on AAU where he is entrusted with mentoring Morven Shreve (Eleanor Fanyinka). Writers then introduced an issue lead storyline for the character as Arthur begins to behave anxiously, self medicating and finally being diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD). After three years in the role Ostlere decided to leave Holby City. The decision was made to kill the character off and producers planned a terminal cancer storyline. It also highlighted the importance of skin checks to detect melanoma and helped raise awareness for a British charity. The character died during the episode titled \\"I'll Walk You Home\\", broadcast on 7 June 2016. Critics of the show have often commented on Arthur's professional skills. Katy Moon of Inside Soap said that Arthur's bedside manner is non-existent. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror branded him \\"very bright\\" but lacking surgical excellence when under pressure. Casting Rob Ostlere passed the early stages of auditioning and was invited to complete an on-set audition at the BBC Elstree Studios. The actor felt nervous because it was the first time he had managed to secure an audition in the actual setting of a show. His casting was publicised a week before he appeared on-screen. Arthur is introduced into the series during the same episode as Gemma Wilde (Ty Glaser). Ostlere and Glaser prepared for their new roles by observing a surgical team in a real hospital. They also worked alongside a registrar and foundation doctors, the latter Glaser believed they \\"learnt a lot from\\". Ostlere also had a friend in medical training and sought advice from them. Development =Characterisation and introduction= Arthur is characterised as having his own sense of logic that differs to the rest of the hospital staff. Ostlere told a BBC Online reporter that \\"he can react in his own unique way\\" and he enjoys trying to decipher his character's reactions. He is not a mean or spiteful character but genuinely believes he is right. Arthur also plays a comedic role in the show because of his clumsy nature and initially was shown to fall over things on the wards. Osltere also claims to be clumsy and when he made mistakes while filming directors would choose to keep it in. Arthur is played as being insensitive in social situations and remains oblivious to other people's feelings. He is also very career ambitious and pressurises himself to succeed. He is good with the medical side of the occupation but fails to behave confidently when conversing with patients and staff. Arthur acknowledges that he lacks social skills but this makes him doubt his abilities. He is also enthusiastic about Napoleonic history but Ostlere did not need to research it because he was already knowledgeable in the field of history. Ostlere worried that he was similar to his character. This was made worse following his first day on-set when Producers mistook Ostlere's bag for an acting prop belonging to Arthur because it fitted their vision of the character. Arthur is stylised with a \\"preppy look\\" and the costume department bought in some \\"out there\\" costumes for him to wear. Arthur's glasses form part of his image. When Ostlere was on-set filming his initial episodes the glasses were loosely fitted and he had to keep adjusting them. This suited the character and became a permanent trait during the actor's portrayal. Arthur also suffers from panic attacks and Ostlere found the scenes challenging and scary to film. Arthur begins his career at Holby City hospital as junior doctor on beginning the foundation programme. He is placed on the Keller Ward under the supervision of Consultant Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola), but fails to impress him. Glaser told Melanie Hancill of The People her character Gemma and Arthur share a competitive relationship because they are trying to earn the same role and the F1 prize in the hospital. He later becomes very stressed despite securing the aforementioned prestigious medical prize. Arthur struggles to live up to his new-found reputation, especially when he fails to reach a diagnosis for a patient and hastily dismisses a staff nurse's accurate findings. Arthur carries on his rotation of Keller Ward and learns that he has progressed well becoming the top performing F1. Consultant general surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon) decides to reward Arthur by placing him in charge of the ward. But this proves to be a mistake as he loses control of the ward. =Chantelle Lane= Arthur forms a friendship with staff nurse Chantelle Lane (Lauren Drummond) and he develops romantic feelings for her. Producers discussed Chantelle at length with Ostlere during the audition process. This made him believe that the two character would form a romance quickly, but this was not to be the case. The show play out a typical soap opera \\"will-they-won't-they?\\" story between them. The actors also had to re-shoot scenes together because Producers felt that their relationship appeared to be progressing faster than they had liked. An ex-boyfriend of Chantelle's, Rhys Hopkins (Gareth David-Lloyd), was introduced and Drummond believed that her character was still in love with Rhys. She told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Chantelle loves Arthur as a friend only. Despite this Drummond perceived them to be a \\"cute\\" on-screen pairing, adding \\"it will take time for things to develop between them\\". She concluded that her character should give Arthur a chance, but noted he does not have the skills to impress her and should try to \\"man-up\\". When Arthur is in charge of Keller Ward he mistreats Chantelle and she accuses him of singling her out because she rebuffed his romantic intentions. He then has to attempt to repair their friendship. Arthur and Chantelle are mugged by a mystery assailant and in the wake of their ordeal he feels guilty for being unable to protect her. When a patient named Cameron Pollins (Sam Jackson) begins acting strange Arthur realises he is their attacker. He threatens Chantelle and grabs her by the neck, but Arthur defends her and they share a kiss. Ostlere said that viewers see a change in Arthur and branded it the first time he managed to \\"man-up\\". Writers created a car crash storyline for the character, Arthur accidentally crashes his car into the back of a lorry with Chantelle and a colleague as his passengers. Ostlere told Moon (Inside Soap) that the crash episode is \\"shocking\\" with a \\"very tense\\" aftermath. Chantelle is critically injured in the accident and he rescues her from the wreckage, the actor added that \\"it's emotional for him seeing the girl he loves in danger.\\" Arthur tries to compensate and fight his guilt by helping during Chantelle's operation. The scenes were filmed on a disused rail track near Luton which was made-up to look like a country road. Filming car crash sequences often requires the vehicle to be placed on a conveyor belt track. But Ostlere was allowed to drive the car with two high-tech cameras attached and he recalled having to be careful as not to break them. Drummond decided to leave the series and producers devised an exit storyline centric to Arthur. Chantelle organises a birthday party for Arthur, but on that day Cameron is admitted to the hospital. Arthur mistreats Cameron because of the mugging attack. He forgets to order a scan and Cameron suffers a heart-attack and dies. Chantelle offers her support to Arthur, Drummond explained that her and Ostlere's characters are brought to the realisation that their close bond is not helping them overcome their ordeals. She decides to distance herself from Arthur by going travelling. But Drummond believed that \\"there's a hint that things aren't over between the two.\\" Ostlere branded it a \\"relationship that has never quite happened\\" which made it more interesting. He also admitted that Arthur's feelings for Chantelle compromised his ability as a doctor. =Dominic Copeland and Zosia March= Following the departures of Drummond and Akingbola, Ostlere began working closely with David Ames and Camilla Arfwedson who play F1 doctors Dominic Copeland and Zosia March respectively. Ames was a former guest cast member and his reintroduced character Dom is an enemy of Arthur because he tried to ruin Malick's career. Working together on Keller Ward proves problematic because Arthur and Malick were close colleagues so his return inevitably causes friction. Ames told a BBC Online reporter that \\"Dom has a long way to go before Arthur even begins to consider them equals, let alone friends. Arthur is a faithful old Labrador.\\" While Ostlere and Ames were interviewed by Lorraine Kelly, Ames explained that Arthur \\"is very suspicious about Dominic but he cannot convince Sasha\\" of his rival's true self. Sacha refuses to believe Arthur because he views them to be working well together, mostly due to Dom manipulating Sacha. Dom becomes bored of Arthur being difficult and decides to create tension for entertainment value. In an interview published by What's on TV, Ames stated \\"there‚Äôs clearly a lot of friction between them and Dom likes to push Arthur's buttons, not least just to entertain himself.\\" Their rivalry is clearly played out during scenes in which they treat the same patient. Arthur takes control of Keller on Sacha's orders, but an opportunistic Dom makes him appear unable to manage the situation. Ames explained his character's scheming against Arthur is motivated by Dom's career driven nature. He is willing to say and do anything and \\"will put his own job above anyone else's job\\". Meanwhile, Arthur's flatmate Zosia becomes best friends with Dom despite Arthur's warnings. A dismissive Zosia then invites Dom to move into their flat. Holby City is usually confined to the hospital set but does often show Arthur, Dom and Zosia in their shared flat. The set is named \\"Arthur's flat\\" and often film in dressing gowns and Ostlere uses the on-set bed to rest, learn his lines and tried to spend more time there. Arthur struggles to control Zosia increasing outlandish behaviour on the ward. Ostlere explained that Zosia has a dominant personality his character cannot handle because he is too socially awkward. When Zosia treats a cancer stricken patient similar to her mother she and Dom get drunk and return to the ward. Ostelere said that Arthur would have reported their behaviour but is compromised because he cares about Zosia and Dom. The scenes depict Arthur losing his good doctor image and turning into a rule-breaker as Zosia suffers a drug overdose resulting Arthur stealing hospital drugs in an effort to save her life. Fearing they will all be struck-off the medical register the trio make a pact to conceal the incident. In 2015, Producer Simon Harper decided to split up the trio having Dom staying on Keller, Zosia moving to Darwin and Arthur working on AAU. Harper said it was a difficult decision to make and it was discussed at length with executive producer Oliver Kent. But Harper wanted to tell stories reflecting real medical careers. He noted that \\"as they mature and progress, [they] would go on to their separate disciplines and wards [...] What's great about the changes is that gives them different stories.\\" =General anxiety disorder= Arthur begins to suffer from extreme anxiety. Following an explosion at the hospital he struggled to control his anxiety and stole medication to help suppress his fears. Morven Shreve (Eleanor Fanyinka) caught him taking hospital drugs for his own use and realised that he had been self-medicating. When Arthur made a mistake during treatment of a patient, Morven ended up getting blamed and she began to consider her future at the hospital. Arthur was later diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder. He took time off work to confront his GAD and returned to work when he felt he had overcome his problems. Ostlere told Bill Gibb from The Sunday Post that Arthur's storyline was realistic because of the demands junior doctors face in the NHS. It is plausible for many to develop the condition in such a pressured environment. Ostlere learned that many people in society experience anxiety and believed that it was an important subject matter for Holby City to portray. It was also important for the show to make the storyline accurate for instance having \\"full-blown panic attacks\\" and more subtle moments with Arthur struggling to control it inside. They also ensured other characters were understanding of his condition to set an example to viewers. He also received much positive feedback from viewers and sufferers of GAD. Dom decides to take Arthur to a seaside resort to give him a break and help him recover following the orders of concerned CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). The pair argue over Dom's estranged father Barry Copeland (Nicholas Ball) after Arthur goes fishing with him. But Arthur defends his friend when he witnesses Barry being homophobic; but when Barry chokes on a peanut Arthur helps save his life. The incident brings Arthur to the realisation that his natural instinct is to be a doctor and decides to return to work. Following his return Dom forces Arthur to remove his \\"geek look\\" and try out a new look to aid his recovery. Ostlere told Gibb that \\"the idea is that he'll get over his anxiety by seeming more confident and putting on a bit of a show.\\" He found it odd adjusting to his character's new look because he was so used to Arthur's glasses and attire. He added \\"Arthur's in a bit of a confused state at the moment and I found that a bit with the new look, too.\\" Arthur later returned to the hospital, but struggled to settle back into his daily routine. He was also disappointed to learn that he was no longer Morven's mentor, and that he had a lot of work to do to repair their working relationship. After his professional hero Professor Walter Dunn (Philip Fox) was admitted to AAU with issues related to alcoholism, Arthur received \\"a massive wake-up call\\" during a conversation with Guy Self (John Michie). =Cancer and death= Ostlere decided to leave Holby City after three years in the role. He felt that it was a \\"difficult decision\\" to leave but wanted to find new challenges. He was then informed that his character would be killed off following a diagnosis of terminal cancer. The actor viewed it as \\"a great opportunity\\" to be able to portray the disease. Producer Simon Harper gave Ostlere the option of his character not being killed off. When he discussed plans to kill off Arthur, Harper was surprised by the actor's reaction. He told Ostlere that he could create an alternate story enabling Arthur to depart the series alive. Ostlere went off and thought about the proposal and later gave his approval for the terminal cancer story. To prepare for the story Ostlere discussed cancer with an oncologist named Bruce. The professional also worked with the writing team to guide them. The actor also talked to his friends who had survived cancer about their experiences. The actor avoided watching other fictional portrayal of the illness such as film and television. He did not want to be influenced and copy stories from other works and preferred to draw from real-life experiences and scripts. The cancer storyline was first publicised in advance spoilers released in February 2016. They detailed that Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg) would find a mole on Arthur's back and notice characteristics associated with melanoma. She contacts Henrik to give Arthur further examinations to determine a prognosis. The examination is a result of Arthur being tested for compatibility to become a live liver donor for Morven's ill father Austin Shreve (Clinton Blake). When Morven's ex-boyfriend Ulysses Barnes (Rupert Lazarus) is admitted to Keller ward, he offers to become a donor. This upsets Arthur who wants to be the one to help Morven's family. Ostlere explained that his character is insecure because Ulysses is everything Arthur is not. Arthur is proven to be a match for Morven and he is \\"thrilled\\" to tell Morven because he \\"wants to be her hero\\". But Essie notices the irregular mole and Arthur dismisses her concern as being \\"over- protective\\". He added \\"he's never really noticed the mole before and reckons it's probably nothing.\\" He really doesn't want to be dealing with this right now ‚Äì he just wants to push on with being the saviour of the day, which he's never been before.\\" Henrik orders that the mole be removed and examined. Ostlere believed that his character was shocked and his plans for Austin are put on hold. He added that Arthur \\"shuts down and doesn't tell anyone about it‚Ä¶ especially Morven.\\" Ostlere later spoke in support of Melanoma Awareness Month and discussed the importance of a once-a-month skin check. He stated that playing the melanoma story made him increasingly aware that regular skin checks aid in the early detection of skin cancer. Gillian Nuttall, founder of Melanoma UK praised Holby City for raising awareness of the condition and credited them with an increase in callers to their helpline. Nuttall added \\"Rob Ostlere‚Äôs portrayal of a patient has resonated with a number of melanoma sufferers.\\" Arthur's mole is removed and is told that the melanoma has been dealt with. The following month Arthur coughs blood and asks Dom to examine him. Dom orders a CT scan which reveals that he has secondary tumours on his lungs. Arthur tells Morven about his condition and accepts he must endure a tough course of chemotherapy. After undergoing chemotherapy Arthur is hopeful that his illness will be cured. He and Morven decide to get married the same day to celebrate his optimism. But Arthur is told by Sacha that his cancer has spread to his stomach and is terminal. Ostlere said Arthur was scared and turned to Sacha for \\"peace of mind\\" but did not expect to be told that he will die. Arthur is left in a \\"state of denial, anger and fear\\". He and Morven agree to cancel their wedding until Arthur has \\"a moment of clarity\\" and realises he wants to marry Morven more than anything else. The two go on and marry in a ceremony at the hospital surrounded by friends. The actor explained that \\"the wedding is about two people doing what they can to carry on and have an amazing day with all their family and friends. It's the best day of Arthur's life... but also the worst.\\" On 7 June 2016, Sara Wallis from the Daily Mirror revealed that \\"I'll Walk You Home\\" would be Arthur's final episode. It featured Arthur and Morven intending to leave Holby to travel before Arthur dies. Dom believes Arthur is being selfish and Arthur re- evaluates his choice and decides to stay. For Arthur's final episode Akingbola and Drummond reprised their roles as Malick and Chantelle. Malick appeared during a Skype conversation and Chantelle appeared in dream sequences envisioned by Arthur as he lay dying. George Rainsford also guest starred as Ethan Hardy, a character from its sister-show Casualty. Ostlere and Rainsford were long-time friends and had petitioned producers to enable their character to share a scene. Arthur collapses and falls unconscious. Nothing can be done to save his life as his cancer is too advanced. While unconscious Arthur has visions of his loved ones and hears Morven deliver her final words to him. He then dies surrounded by his friends. Reception Inside Soap's Moon described Arthur stating \\"geeky Arthur Digby is a master at cracking medical conundrums - but when it comes to bedside manner, he'd have better luck at solving a Rubik's Cube in the dark than finding the appropriate words of comfort!\\" The Holby City audience viewed Arthur, Dom and Zosia as the show's \\"dream team\\" and were sad when they furthered their careers separately. Flynn Sarler from Radio Times criticised the show for being miserable. He targeted Arthur as being one of the causes, adding \\"oh yes, and if this weren‚Äôt bad enough, our beloved Dr Digby starts down a very dodgy road.\\" A Coventry Evening Telegraph writer said that Arthur was constant proof that \\"nice guys always come last\\" in life. A reporter of the South Wales Echo found it odd that the \\"scarily confident\\" Zosia and \\"dear little Digby\\" had so much in common as friends despite being \\"complete opposites\\". Their colleague criticised Arthur's awarding of the Junior Doctor of the Year award, labelling it a \\"source of embarrassment\\" and \\"odd\\" that he received it despite endangering fellow character's lives in the car accident. Another opined that Arthur and Dom's feud is the type of behaviour likely to make viewers research private health care rather than use the NHS. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror questioned Arthur's surgical skills. She judged that \\"Arthur's a nice guy, and all that, and very bright but I'm not sure how pleased Elliot would be at having his brain being used as a learning experience. Let's also not forget that it was Digby who cost Malick his hand so I don't know how he'd ever live with himself if he wrecked Professor Hope's brain too.\\" Sara Williams of the Daily Mirror branded Arthur's exit \\"particularly gritty and gruelling\\". Sarah Deen from the Metro said that his death \\"might be one of its saddest episodes ever\\". Kayleigh Dray from Closer said that Arthur was a popular character and his death made \\"tearjerking scenes\\".

The group, for the greater duration of its existence, was rather straightforward in their musical style; however, their best-known recording, \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\", exemplifies some of the odder aspects of psychedelia. The song was a regional hit and has since achieved favor among psychedelic music enthusiasts, who rediscovered the composition through several compilation albums. History Initially formed by Teddy Flores (lead vocals, harmonica) in 1964, the first incarnation of the band‚Äîa Motown- influenced group‚Äîwas received with only local notice until Flores decided to reshuffle the line-up and its musical style in 1966. Flores' new group included Bernard Pearson (lead guitar), David Conway (keyboards), Steve \\"Herbie\\" Urbani (bass guitar), and Steve Marley (drums). The name, Teddy and His Patches, was derived from the eye patch Flores wore as a result of losing his left eye to complications caused by cancer. The band soon garnered a large following in the burgeoning San Jose rock scene, performing regularly at the Cocoanut Grove, the Continental Ballroom, and a small club known as Loser's South. Much of Teddy and His Patches' live setlist was taken from the Yardbirds and the Animals, though Marley also recalls a wide-variety of musical interests ranging from psychedelia, to Roy Orbison, and the post- Rubber Soul Beatles. In November 1966, the band was given the opportunity to record for Chance Records. The label was spearheaded by local record producer Grady O'Neal, who owed Conway and Marley for the various odd jobs they performed at TIKI Studios. As home to country and Western musicians, at first the record label was apprehensive to signing a young group experimenting with psychedelic music. However, musical tastes aside, the label was more conscientious of Teddy and His Patches' growing following in San Jose. Recording sessions generated two tracks, including \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\", a bizarre tune written by Conway and promoter Jerry Ralston. The song was inspired by the opening dialogue‚Äîwhich \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\" features Flores mysteriously reciting‚Äîtaken from the Frank Zappa composition \\"The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\". On the tune's raw fidelity, Marley recalls, \\"[t]he psychedelic whoops heard on the track were part of the live recording, with Teddy moving from a studio mic to a hand-held PA mic that was plugged into an old Fender tape-loop echo feeding back through a PA monitor. The whole thing was recorded without a single overdub or edit...and in just three or four takes total\\". Chance Records issued \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\" and \\"From Day to Day\\" as Teddy and His Patches' debut single in February 1967, with the release reaching number one in San Jose. The single opened new opportunities for the band, such as becoming the opening act for more prominent groups including the Doors and Moby Grape. Another single, the gloomy \\"Haight-Ashbury\\", also had some success in San Jose; however, neither \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\" or their follow- up managed to breakthrough nationally. According to various accounts by the band members, five to ten additional songs were recorded in a more conventional 8-track studio, but were never released because their two singles failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. Urbani and Marley also both speculate that the master tapes still survive, since the group's released material is featured on several compilation albums. Following financial disagreements and departures of key members, Teddy and His Patches disbanded in late-1967. Since its initial distribution, \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\" has been compiled on numerous albums including Pebbles, Volume 3, Acid Dreams, and Love Is the Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965‚Äì1970, among several others. \\"From Day to Day\\" is found on Sixties Rebellion, Volume 6 and Victims of Circumstances, Volume 2 and \\"Haight-Ashbury\\" is featured on 60s Punk Sampler, Volume 2, Boulders, Volume 2, and A Heavy Dose of Lyte Psych.

They are nocturnal predators that hide during the day in small retreats, and are sit- and-wait predators at night. P. longipes can be found in subtropical and tropical forests, and caves within their range. Appearance The body of P. longipes can measure up to long, but its front legs can reach long. Like other Amblypygi, Phrynus longipes has eight pairs of legs with six used for walking and the first employed as sensory organs for detecting prey and navigating their environment. Its cephalothorax is wider than it is long and is outfitted with eight eyes. One pair of eyes is located in front and 3 more pairs on the sides. They produce no venom, but instead have arm-like pedipalps and a pair of smaller chelicerae. Behavior P. longipes use 3 pairs of ambulatory legs to move sideways as a crab would and 1 pair for sensory purposes. They capture prey using, arm-like pedipalps. P. longipes engage in agonistic contests over territories, where opponents use a series of displays to communicate their resource holding potential to wouldbe usurpers. Additionally, P. longipes is occasionally cannibalistic. Reproduction During courtship, the male and female P. longipes exhibiting ritualized displays in a stereotyped sequence. Males deposit a spermatophore that the female retrieves to fertilize eggs. After a few weeks to months she exudes a brood sac containing from 40 to 90 eggs. Newly hatched offspring move to the mothers dorsal opisthosoma before molting once more into a free-living stage.

The missions of safety net hospitals are rather, to focus and emphasize their devotion to providing the best possible care for those who are barred from health care due to the various possible adverse circumstances. These circumstances mostly revolve around problems with financial payments, insurance plans, or health conditions. As per America's Health Care Safety Net: Intact but Endangered, safety net hospitals are known for maintaining an open-door policy for their services. Some safety net hospitals even offer high-cost services like burn care, trauma care, neonatal treatments, and inpatient behavioral health. Some also provide training for healthcare professionals. The Health and Hospital Corporation in NYC, Cook County Health and Hospital System in Chicago, and Parkland Health & Hospital System in Dallas are three of the United States' largest safety net hospitals.  History  The presence of philanthropic medical institutions during the 19th century pre-date the modern American safety net hospital. These hospitals were funded by religious groups or wealthy benefactors, and their target population was the poor. However, towards the turn of the century, these institutions began transitioning into for-profit organizations, as they began to accept patients from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Towards 1922, as these businesses grew, revenue from patient care accounted for 65.2% of the total revenue for these community hospitals. Along with the introduction of private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid during the 1980s, by the time 1994 arrived, 94% of the revenue came from patient care. However, in 1996, approximately 43 million people (one-fifth of the U.S. population under age 65) had no medical insurance and an additional 29 million were underinsured. These numbers were also expected to rise in the next decade. This led to the advent of what we consider a safety net hospital. Hospitals were already practicing uncompensated health care during the 1980s, with the help of state funding and Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) programs, in order to provide medical treatment to the uninsured and the underinsured in urban cities. However, this practice became more commonplace when the state of health care began to look difficult. Financing a safety net hospital Safety net hospitals oftentimes find themselves in difficult financial positions due to the vulnerable financial state of the patients and lack of sufficient federal, state and local funding; safety net hospitals have high rates of Medicaid and Medicare payers (Medicaid has unreliable/insufficient processes of government to hospital repayment) and a large proportion of safety net hospital patients serve traditionally low income and marginalized/vulnerable populations. There is a complex array of public funding that comes to safety net hospitals (as being legally defined as a safety net hospital entitles these entities to financial compensation to overcome the cost of medical expenses not paid for by patients) mostly through Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments, Medicaid Upper Payment Limit Payments, Medicaid Indirect Medical Education Payments, and state/local indigent health programs. However, these financial entities created to sustain safety net hospitals in repayments are often not enough. According to the National Rural Health Association, 83 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 due to the substantial financial pressure. In 2013, hospitals across the United States generated $44.6 billion in uncompensated care costs; uncompensated care costs are costs accrued from services that the hospitals provided to patients that were not able to pay and that also went unpaid by government entities. Additionally, there tends to be a lack of socioeconomic development and a lack of health care providers (both general and specialized) in the geographical regions where safety net hospitals tend to be located; this observation is made by Waitzkin and he refers to these facts as part of the social and structural \\"contradictions\\" that safety net hospitals face further negatively impact there financial stability and care performance. Besides, many of the level I trauma centers are within safety net hospitals and their financial stability is highly affected by policy changes. In a study, they found that county SNHs were the last in net revenue income compared to non-profit SNHs and non-SNHs ($41.6 million vs $111.4 million vs $287.1 millio respectively). Although ACA has changed the financial situation of SNHs, county SNHs still faced a negative margins in 2015. However, for many hospital types, the net patient revenue increased. =Prospects for safety net hospitals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act= Under statute, Medicaid and Medicare issue disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments that offset hospitals‚Äô expenditures for uncompensated care. These payments are intended to improve access for Medicaid recipients and uninsured patients, as well as to shore up the financial stability of safety-net hospitals. Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as \\"Obamacare\\"), the Medicare portion of the program has already been limited, and under the ACA the Medicaid portion of the program is also scheduled to be restricted. This was built into the law under the assumption that the amount of uncompensated care would decline substantially under the ACA due to expanded coverage. However, coverage did not expand as much as anticipated in many states due to the unanticipated choice not to expand Medicaid access under the Act (a result of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius). An additional issue with Obamacare and safety net hospitals arises from the coverage gap for those who have too high of an income to qualify for Medicaid but have too low of an income to afford a private plan; it is projected that even with the implementation of the health care law in 2016, roughly 30 million people are still expected to be without insurance coverage and find service in safety net hospitals. Another issue revolves around the fact that hospitals are required to provide care for patients in the emergency department, even if the person cannot pay or is an illegal immigrant. =Prospects for safety net hospitals under the Trump Administration= The American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA) repealed part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in such that it cut Medicaid coverage for lower-income Americans and would effectively stop ACA's Medicaid expansion, which estimates lost coverage for 24 million people by 2026. In addition, it places a limit on federal dollars that the states receive to cover health insurance to millions of low-income patients. These federal cuts and increased enrollment criteria for federal welfare programs will create an inevitable cost shift on patients and will make it more difficult for Americans to be able to participate and receive aid from federal programs, especially with less money allocated to these programs. Less money allocated to federal programs and the simultaneous repeals to Obamacare will lead to less patients receiving financial help and qualifying for insurance programs, which means they will have to pay more money out of pocket. It is estimated that there will be 15 million or more fewer individuals insured with \\"Trumpcare\\" than with Obamacare. This will directly impact safety net hospitals because the number of patients without insurance will increase at safety net hospitals but in turn, safety net hospitals will also be suffering a decrease in financial support from the federal government and will not be able to absorb as many costs for these patients. The aforementioned proposed acts will place financial burdens and operational constraints on both patients and safety net hospitals. It is projected that under the AHCA, hospitals in both expanded Medicaid and nonexpanded states are predicted to have negative operating margins by 2026, which endangers the quality of patient care and the low-income communities, and ultimately, threatens closure of the hospital.  Types of Safety Net Providers  = Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) = Federally Qualified Health Center are public and private non- profit health care organizations that meet federally mandated requirements to provide comprehensive and appropriate health care services to a medically underserved population. They must also adjust service fees based on patients ability to pay, have an ongoing qualify assurance program, and have a governing board of directors. In turn, FQHCs receive reimbursements from Medicaid through their Prospective Payment System (PPS). They also can also apply for the Health Center Program grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources and Services Administration. = Federally Qualified Health Centers Look-Alikes (FQHCs look-alikes) = FQHCs that meet all the federal health center program requirements but don't receive health center grant funding are called FQHC look-alikes. These FQHCs are typically non- profit community health centers and regional clinical associations. = Rural Health Centers (RHC) = Rural Health Centers are public, private, or non- profit health centers that provide primary care to Medicaid and Medicare populations in rural areas. RHC status is designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, providing enhanced reimbursements rates for services. A health center cannot be both an RHC and a FQHC. = Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) = Disproportionate share hospital are characterized by a significantly high number of low-income patients that is disproportionate. These hospitals do not receive payment for their services and are not reimbursement by Medicare, Medical, health insurance, or the Children's Health Insurance Program. State submit independent certified audits along with an annual report detailing how their payments to each DSH Hospital. After doing so they states receive Federal Financial Participation (FFP), an annual allotment. = Community Health Centers = Community Health Centers are clinics with a mission to provide care to low-income populations regardless of their ability to pay. However, they do not have to meet any federal requirements because they do not receive federal funding or reimbursements from medicare or medical. They usually operate through donations.

In response to these critiques, safety net hospitals have put emphasis on their attempts to increase their patient experience scores and are developing training classes for customer service that includes employee evaluations as well as employee orientations and advocating for policy changes that could improve the patient experience. Hospitals are trying to increase their compassion and quality of care in order to satisfy patient experiences. Patients who receive satisfying cares are more likely to introduce the hospital to others vs. when they leave with unsatisfaction; therefore, ultimately this would affect the number of patients visiting the revenue of the hospital.

It merged with St. John's Episcopal Hospital to form Interfaith Medical Center in 1983. History The hospital's predecessor was the Brooklyn Hebrew Hospital Society, formed in 1895 as a clinic. In the early 20th century, many Jewish communities saw both benefit and need in developing modern hospital facilities. By 1901, local community leaders saw the need to expand the Society to a 50-bed hospital, and by 1903, had purchased an older hospital campus, the Memorial Hospital for Women and Children, to renovate and reopen. It was located on the block of Classon Avenue, between Prospect Place and St. Marks Avenue. Shortly after its purchase, the trustees decided that the community could support a much larger facility and spent several years fundraising, insisting that work not start until money was in hand to cover all the work. This combination of expansive plans and fiscal conservatism delayed the opening by several years. In 1906, as fundraising and construction continued, additional property was purchased along St Marks Avenue, and later that year, an additional adjacent tract was acquired. The additional space was used for a nursing school and dormitory, and administrative offices. The hospital opened to patients on December 17, 1906. The nursing school had opened earlier in the month, on December 4. In the 1920s, Nathan Jonas donated additional land to the hospital for a park, but it was later used to build a new wing, which opened in 1928, giving the hospital a 650-bed capacity. Jonas, a founder of the hospital, raised much of its funding from Abraham Abraham, a founder of the Abraham & Straus department store. In the 1930s, the hospital's president, Joseph Baker, was also the chair of the nearby Long Island College Hospital. While the hospital thrived for about 50 years after its opening and continued to expand further along and across Prospect Place, it ran into financial trouble as the neighborhood declined. Short on money, the physical plant and equipment was neglected. Jewish Hospital was forced into bankruptcy, reorganized, and eventually merged with St. John's, another struggling hospital. After the merger, most of the campus, including the original main building along Classon Avenue, was sold off and converted to apartment buildings. The masonry facade on Classon still bears the name of the hospital. A building on Prospect Place continues to serve as an outpatient clinic of the surviving organization. The elimination of the legacy Jewish Hospital after the merger has been cited as an example of the issues facing mergers of struggling partner hospitals and of the difficulties of merging dissimilar sectarian cultures.

Development of biofuels  During her career she encouraged the local production of natural gas and focussed particularly on the development of biofuels, to overcome the volatility of the petroleum market. By 2002 she observed that ‚Äòvulnerability is the rule of the game‚Äô due to instability and tension in the Middle East and the related terrorism threats.

Daniel Defoe's Colonel Jack and Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist are the most prominent examples of novels dealing with such reality. History =Etymology= Etymologically speaking, the word \\"blackguard\\" seems to have undergone a change between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Originally spelled as two different words, \\"black\\" plus \\"guard\\", it was eventually used as a single word to indicate those attendants or servants who were in charge of the kitchens, or perhaps black-liveried personal guards. The offensive meaning of \\"scoundrel\\", \\"villain\\", or any other term which might have suggested the person in question belonged to the criminal world dates back to the late thirties of the 18th century. Starting from 1784, it was also used as an adjective meant to indicate people of \\"worthless character\\" and low social status, such as camp followers and vagabonds. =Background= In the first decades of the 18th century, London stood out among other European cities for its beauty and maintenance, but it nonetheless had to deal with the utter poverty a huge portion of its inhabitants struggled with. Many people couldn't even afford a proper accommodation for the night, and would either spend the little they had gained during the day through begging and charity to pay for disreputable lodgings or find shelter in barns, haylofts and stables to avoid sleeping rough. In 1796, a survey of the streets of London recorded the existence of more than two thousand adults (mostly women) and three hundred children whose only way of living was begging; London was full of places for them to hide and this enabled them to maintain such a lifestyle for a long time, sometimes even years. Living on the streets and the necessity of surviving any way they could brought paupers and vagrants to engage themselves in a wide range of unregulated occupations, from the illegal ones such as prostitution, to temporary employments as chimney or crossing-sweepers, food sellers, shoeblacks or milkmaids. Many simply sold what they managed to collect on the streets, changed their trade according to different seasons and circumstances, and sometimes took advantage of their professions to obtain charity through their labour, approaching passers-by, begging and pickpocketing. The position they occupied was thus an ambiguous one, set somewhere between mendicancy and service. This was the fate of many children, sometimes not even orphans, but illegitimate children born out of wedlock. What they had in common was that there was no one left to care for them: they were reduced to wearing rags, were food deprived, and gangs were sometimes able to provide that support they lacked, even if joining one usually meant turning to crime. Daniel Defoe describes them as likely to die young, either because of rough weather conditions or starvation. =The case of Thomas Coleman= Thomas Coleman, aged 11 or 12, was arrested on 4 November 1730 for stealing two dowlas shirts, while his accomplice managed to escape. Forced to a confession, he decided to turn king's evidence, thus providing Justice George Wellham with a detailed list of both crimes and accomplices. Though such an eager deposition was probably meant to avoid prosecution, he was eventually brought to trial at the Old Bailey anyway, and acquitted on 15 January 1731, but in the meantime he had managed to expose an organized criminal gang led by Katherine Collins. Coleman named at least 14 other boys lodging with him in her house, and explained how she forced them all to steal whatever came to hand. She would then buy the stolen items, and refused to give them shelter, were they to come back empty-handed. They would then lay in the near glass house, which Defoe describes in his Colonel Jack: > Those who know the position of the glass houses, and the arches where they > neal the bottles after they are made (...), know that those places where the > ashes are cast, and where the poor boys lie, are cavities in the brick-work, > perfectly close, except at the entrance, and consequently warm.Defoe, > Daniel, The history and remarkable life of the truly honourable Colonel > Jacque commonly called Colonel Jack, p. 22. Within a few years, most of them were caught and faced several different punishments, for either stealing, housebreaking or selling stolen goods. John Collins, Katherine's own son, had already been transported after being found guilty of theft in the summer of 1729. There appear to be further records on the account of someone named Thomas Coleman, but there is no way to be sure they concern the same person. =In the Proceedings= Engraving of Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist The people those children would steal from often found themselves in only slightly better circumstances, and the stolen items would consist of a few yards of linen, a pair of shoes, some handkerchiefs or anything they could get their hands on. During the eighteenth century, about 125 boys and girls whose age was at most fourteen were tried at the Old Bailey for either theft or violent theft, 77 of whom were convicted of grand larceny. Way below came burglary, theft from a specified place and shoplifting, amongst others. Almost half of them were sentenced to transportation (57 out of 125), 18 were condemned to death, while the others faced several different punishments, or, in a few cases, no punishment at all. Back then, children could be held responsible for their actions from the age of 7 onward (even if they were not considered adults until the age of 14) and could therefore undergo different types of punishments; those who received a death sentence, though, were very likely to obtain a pardon, and be sentenced to transportation instead. In fact, there is no evidence any of the 16 boys and two girls who did receive a death sentence throughout the 18th century has actually been executed. It wasn't until 1847 that a Juvenile Offenders Act was approved, allowing young people under the age of 14 (and eventually 16) to be tried by a special court. =Infant Mortality Rate= In the early 18th century, apart from local parishes (and eventually charity schools), the Christ's Hospital was the only establishment able to provide orphans and foundlings with some sort of protection. Together with epidemics and inadequate living conditions, the more tolerant attitude towards violence was a very relevant issue: over 130 trials against infanticide were held at the Old Bailey from 1700 to 1799, and there are records of other more or less sporadic cases of violence, such as the killing of a young girl in the fall of 1720. These factors helped to increase the already high infant mortality rate: in the third decade of 1700, London seems to have witnessed the christening of roughly 150,000 children, but 110,000 under the age of 5 were buried in that same few years. In Literature George Cruikshank original engraving of Oliver (right), the pickpocket Artful Dodger (centre), and the criminal Fagin (left) There is a whole branch of novels dealing with the reality of orphans and their everyday struggles, but Colonel Jack and Oliver Twist, written in 1722 and between 1837 and 1839 respectively, can be named as the most prominent ones describing the life of theft some children turned to. Both stories show how their young protagonists, either orphaned or abandoned, are forced to face the world on their own, and end up assisting criminals or becoming thieves themselves in order to survive. Oliver promptly repents entering a life of crime, and is even wrongly brought to trial for it; very similar is the path the orphan Pip follows in Great Expectations, as he is scared by a convict into stealing. Several stage versions and cinematographic adaptations exist for both of Dickens's novels. On the contrary, Jack becomes an actual pickpocket, and manages to get away with murder several times: > The violence of the blow beat the old gentleman quite down, the bag of money > did not immediately fly out of his hand, but I run to get hold of it, and > gave it a quick snatch, pulled it clean away, and run like the wind.Defoe, > Daniel,\\" The history and remarkable life of the truly honourable Colonel > Jacque commonly called Colonel Jack\\", p. 85. His \\"adventures\\", though, as he likes to call them, begin to escalate towards more violence and menaces, until his conscience comes into play. His accomplice Will scorns his pity and doubts, and declares him unfit for their business, if he's not ready to go all the way should the circumstances require him to. Jack calls it quit, and goes as far as bringing the money back to a poor elderly woman they had previously robbed, right before Will is captured and sentenced to be hanged. In his preface, Daniel Defoe laments the conditions which bring destitute children to steal by necessity instead of becoming educated and well-principled men, and hopes his readers will find the story instructive. Legacy The Foundling Hospital. Within the first two decades of the 18th century, the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge founded charity schools in most London parishes. Its aim was to provide poor children with education and clothing with no or little charge, and to address the issues of both child poverty and under-employment, as they would even try to put them out to trades. The conditions those children were forced to live in, with little or no shelter, food and clothes, as well as Thomas Coleman's confession, might have strengthened Captain Thomas Coram's belief that such a situation needed to be improved. Besides, as mentioned before, children mortality rates were extremely high: only 26 children out of 100 outlived their 5th birthday, and the percentage related to the workhouses was even lower. Coram, whose plan was to save as many as possible, had already been militating for several years when his Foundling Hospital was eventually founded in 1741. Such structure helped setting the ground for the first adoption procedures, and fought against the mentality of the time, which considered destitution and vagrancy a necessary evil. Also, it allowed children to be granted nurturance and an education, sometimes through a foster family, until the age of fifteen, so that they would eventually be able to provide for themselves. The very same aim was shared by other charitable foundations, such as the Lambeth Asylum, founded in 1758, which was meant to rescue from the streets, educate and train orphaned girls and penitent prostitutes.

As of 2011 it was a few feet underwater, and NOAA has marked two Nautical passes, \\"Little Dog Keys\\" and \\"Dog Keys\\", next to it.

Bootleggers used the island and its fresh water during prohibition. More famously, in 1926 three partners opened the Isle of Caprice cabanas hotel, a casino resort where alcoholic drink could be sold openly. The place was very popular, but after continued natural erosion and a hurricane that diminished the sandy island, in 1932 it was abandoned.

It includes the areas of California, Rowditch, and St Lukes, as well as a small part of Normanton. Part of its eastern boundary is formed by Abbey Street, from which the ward takes its name. It is a largely residential area, with a mixture of Victorian terraced housing and 20th century suburban development. The population was 15,334 in 2011. Geography Abbey ward is a densely populated urban area located immediately to the west and south-west of Derby city centre. To the north, it borders the New Zealand area of Mackworth ward, approximately along the route of the former Friargate railway line. Derby's Outer Ring Road forms the boundary with Littleover and Blagreaves to the west and south-west, while Abbey Street and Burton Road are on the eastern and south-eastern boundary separating Abbey from Arboretum ward. To the south- east, it also borders Normanton. The area is largely residential and contains a mixture of 19th century terraced housing nearer to the city centre along with mid-20th century suburban estates nearer to the ring road. =Areas of Abbey= California California is a suburban area on the west of the ward, located about south-west of the city centre. The area around St. Albans Road consists of detached and semi-detached suburban housing developments dating from the period after the construction of the Outer Ring Road in 1928. There are also some older areas of terraced housing to the north-east, nearer Rowditch.Craven, pp. 35‚Äì36 Rowditch Rowditch (from Old English, meaning \\"Rough Ditch\\") is the area around the junction of Uttoxeter Old Road and Uttoxeter New Road, about west-south-west of the city centre. It grew from a small medieval hamlet situated on the former Roman route of Icknield Street.

Before becoming urbanised it was an area of arable land known as Abbey Barns, which belonged to the Abbey of Darley. Some of the Victorian terraced housing which formerly typified the whole area was cleared and redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s.Craven, pp. 58‚Äì62 New Normanton Although most of Normanton is within the ward of that name, a small part of New Normanton (the area around Carlton Road) forms the southern part of Abbey ward. Government Abbey is one of the seventeen electoral wards which make up Derby, and as such elects three councillors to Derby City Council. As of the 2019 local elections, the ward is represented by two councillors from the Labour Party and one Liberal Democrat. It is one of seven Derby wards that form the Derby North constituency in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament.

Early life Rebecca George OBE MA MSc FBCS CITP was born in Basingstoke, England, in the Shrubbery, the local maternity hospital. Her father, Garth, was a nuclear physicist born in South Africa, who moved to the UK in 1949. Her mother, Elizabeth George, had been a social worker, and was a teacher in a local comprehensive school throughout Rebecca George‚Äôs childhood. Later, she became one of the first women ordained into the Church of England. She has two younger brothers, Matthew and Adam. George went to school in Basingstoke, Fairfields Primary School, Harriet Costello comprehensive secondary school, and then the Sixth Form College Queen Mary‚Äôs College. She played the violin with the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra, and flew for the first time at 17 to Australia, on tour with the orchestra. Rebecca George read English Language and Literature at St Hugh's College, Oxford, which was an all-women college at the time. She chose St Hugh's College as there were far fewer women than men at Oxford at the time, and even fewer from comprehensive schools and she believed that she would have a better experience there than more traditional Oxford colleges. At St Hugh's College, she ran the drama society for three years and also taught herself to use the college computer, a Honeywell, so that she could earn money by typing up Fine Art student‚Äôs theses. While she was at Oxford her Sixth Form College head-master suggested that she applied for a Rotary Foundation Scholarship which she won. She used the scholarship to go to Boston University in the USA and take a Master of Science in Broadcasting, specialising in Cable and Satellite systems. Rebecca George married in 1991 and has two sons. Her husband gave up work to bring up their sons when they were 1 and 3. Professional life Rebecca George worked in cable TV in the early 1980s in the USA and UK, including for one of Robert Maxwell‚Äôs companies, SelecTV (US TV channel). Realising that cable and satellite TV was not taking off in the UK as fast as she had hoped, she joined a management consultancy, Spicer and Pegler for three years to broaden her range of skills. In 1988 she joined IBM as a sales rep, at the time IBM were just entering the professional services market. George stayed at IBM for nearly 20 years, in a range of roles in sales, HR and business process engineering. She worked for two years in the US in the mid-1990s, and for a year in France later on. George‚Äôs focus has always been transforming business processes enabled by IT. In 2001, she started working with the Public Sector as the UK government was starting its digital journey. In 2006, she joined Deloitte as a Partner, in their Public Sector business. Initially, she worked with Central Government Departments, and in 2011 she took over Deloitte‚Äôs UK Healthcare Practice. Currently, she leads the Deloitte's UK Healthcare Practice and is the Global lead for Public Sector Health and Social Services, in addition to being Deloitte‚Äôs lead Partner for Healthcare in the UK, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. She specialises in clinical transformation enabled by technology and has a particular interest in improving patient outcomes in cancer and diabetes. It was while she was working in the USA that she was inspired to get involved in a range of diversity initiatives, including increasing the participation of women in IT. Her passion for diversity has continued ever since. She has led or been involved with initiatives to encourage and support women in IT at every level ‚Äì school projects, university applications and courses, graduate recruitment schemes, early career development, maternity leave and returners, executive promotion and retention, and board participation. Honour and other awards and roles Rebecca George received her OBE in 2006, for services to IT and for her work supporting the Egan Review of Sustainable community skills Rebecca George, a Fellow of the BCS, Chartered Institute of IT, undertook, in 2013, the role of Chair of the BCS Policy and Public Affairs Board, and was elected as BCS Vice President and BCS Trustee in 2014 She became a Freeman of the City of London and Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists in October 2015. Rebecca George was voted the 20th \\"Most Influential Women in IT\\" in 2014 and again in 2015 in Computer Weekly.

It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually arranged in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped, bell-shaped or cone-shaped fruit.E. alligatrix flower buds Description Eucalyptus alligatrix is a tree that sometimes grows to a height of . It has thick, fibrous, furrowed bark on the trunk and branches. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged in opposite pairs, broadly egg-shaped to more or less round, long, wide and lack a petiole. Juvenile leaves are also dull bluish green with a whitish bloom. Adult leaves are bluish green, lance-shaped, often curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers buds are usually arranged in groups of three, sometimes seven, in leaf axils. The groups are on a peduncle long, individual buds on a pedicel up to long. The buds are diamond-shaped to spindle-shaped, long and wide. The operculum is cone-shaped and slightly shorter than the floral cup. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, bell-shaped or cone-shaped capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus alligatrix was first formally described in 1991 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected south-west of Jamieson. The description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (alligatrix) is the feminine form of the Latin word alligator meaning \\"one who binds\\", hence \\"she who binds together\\", referring to the characteristics of this species that are intermediate between those of E. cinerea and E. cephalocarpa. In 1995, Ian Brooker and Andrew Slee described three subspecies and published the descriptions in Australian Systematic Botany: * Eucalyptus alligatrix subsp. alligatrix that grows to a height of and has a crown with both adult and juvenile leaves when mature and with flower buds always in groups of three; * Eucalyptus alligatrix subsp. limaensis, commonly known as the Lima stringybark that grows to a height of and has a crown with only adult leaves when mature and with flower buds always in groups of three; * Eucalyptus alligatrix subsp. miscella that grows to a height of and has a crown with only adult leaves when mature and with flower buds in groups of both three and seven on the same tree. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grows in woodland, often regenerating in previously cleared paddocks. * Subspecies alligatrix grows in the Eildon, Jamieson and Big River areas in Victoria; * Subspecies limaensis is only known from near Swanpool in Victoria; * Subspecies miscella has a restricted distribution near Rylstone in New South Wales. Conservation Subspecies limaensis and miscella are both classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to Lima stringybark include ringbarking of trees by livestock, soil degradation, weed invasion and grazing. A recovery plan for the subspecies has been prepared. Subspecies miscella is only known from a single grazing property near Rylstone where regeneration is minimal. The main threats to the species include grazing by livestock, habitat destruction and inappropriate fire regimes.

It was introduced by . Statement A more general version of Frobenius's theorem states that if C is a conjugacy class with h elements of a finite group G with g elements and n is a positive integer, then the number of elements k such that kn is in C is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (hn,g). Applications One application of Frobenius's theorem is to show that the coefficients of the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential are p integral, by interpreting them in terms of the number of elements of order a power of p in the symmetric group Sn. Frobenius conjecture Frobenius conjectured that if in addition the number of solutions to xn=1 is exactly n where n divides the order of G then these solutions form a normal subgroup. This has been proved as a consequence of the classification of finite simple groups. The symmetric group S3 has exactly 4 solutions to x4=1 but these do not form a normal subgroup; this is not a counterexample to the conjecture as 4 does not divide the order of S3.

It feeds water from Angram and Scar House reservoirs in upper Nidderdale, North Yorkshire to Bradford in West Yorkshire. The aqueduct supplies of water per day to Chellow Heights water treatment works. The aqueduct and the reservoirs it connects to are all maintained by Yorkshire Water.  History  In 1892 Parliamentary Powers were granted for the City of Bradford to dam the River Nidd and its tributary Stone Beck in upper Nidderdale, and to build a conduit that delivered the water by gravity to Chellow Heights in Bradford. As Bradford has no major rivers running through it, the city needed fresh water for drinking and to be able to process wool (fulling). At that time, both Nidderdale and Bradford were in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The first two reservoirs, Hayden Carr and Gouthwaite, were constructed in the early 1890s. Work started at Hayden Carr in 1894 by Morrison and Mason of Edinburgh. In 1893 John Best & Son started at Gouthwaite Reservoir further downstream, a compensation reservoir constructed so that the water supply to the lower Nidd valley would not be interrupted by work on the upper dams. In 1904 Bradford Water Works Corporation initiated the building of the next reservoir in the scheme in upper Nidderdale. Angram reservoir was also constructed by John Best & Son, to a design by Bradford's city engineer, James Watson. The aqueduct was constructed by Morrison & Mason Ltd. When Angram was nearing completion, Bradford Corporation decided to construct a larger dam at Scar House, which would incorporate and submerge the Hayden Carr reservoir. Scar House Reservoir was started in 1920 with direct labour under the control of James Watson's successor, Lewis Mitchell, and completed in 1936. The new reservoir required the construction of a new tunnel from Scar House to How Stean Beck, which was started in 1929 by the Hoare family.  Route  The aqueduct starts downstream of Scar House Reservoir, after the screening chamber on the south bank, a short distance east of the dam, at Ordnance Survey grid reference SE 06820 76880. (The screening chamber is shown on OS 25,000 map but not on 50,000 map). The Aqueduct tunnels under Rain Stang hill for at a depth of , and re-appears at Armathwaite Gill. There is then a short overground section across How Stean Beck before another tunnel, long, below Heathfield Moor. The aqueduct then tunnels below Greenhow Hill, below the summit, for before re-appearing at Skyreholme, near Appletreewick. It crosses the River Wharfe on the Barden Aqueduct Bridge, between Barden and Bolton Abbey, and then Barden Beck near Barden Beck Bridge. It then heads across open land again, crosses the A59 at Bolton Abbey Railway Station and runs adjacent to Chelker Reservoir above Addingham. The aqueduct then descends into Airedale and crosses first the Leeds Liverpool Canal over Mauds Bridge in Bingley, then Bingley South Bog Site of Special Scientific Interest. It passes underneath the A650 dual carriageway and crosses the River Aire at Cottingley. It then goes up to Chellow Heights where the water is stored. Clarification is needed about whether water from Nidd Valley and Chelker are transported separately to Chellow Heights WTW or mix before arrival. Separate arrival paths allow precise adjustment of pH on arrival.  Construction  The route of the aqueduct is mostly sub-surface, apart from some small sections that drain water into the aqueduct. It was constructed from of cut-and-cover, of steel and cast-iron pipes and of branch feeder pipes. The route is entirely fed by gravity and the use of syphons. These also pick water up from other becks and streams in Nidderdale that the aqueduct crosses. The aqueduct is over high inside and is lined with concrete. The only evidence of the aqueduct is in the various crossing bridges and syphons where the route goes across other bodies of water. Most of the exposed sections of the aqueduct have crenelated walls and towers. The bridge over the River Wharfe at Barden Beck is now used by walkers on the Dales Way. A pump was installed at Barden on the River Wharfe that is capable of abstracting of water a day into the Nidd Aqueduct and bolster the supply to Bradford. The section through Greenhow Hill was long and was completed in 1899. This was beneficial to the lead miners there as it would drain away excess water from their mineworkings. Another pipe was added alongside the original in 1920. Ten years later, the original pipe was found to be out of alignment where it runs underneath Bingley South Bog. The 1920 pipe is elevated above the bog on concrete supports, but the original pipe was laid down underneath the bog surface. The pressure from the bog was forcing the pipe out of alignment and was in danger of interrupting the water supply.

In the franchise she is the aunt of Wiske and the adoptive aunt of Suske, of whom she both takes care. In the original Flemish publications her name was Sidonie, while the translations in the Netherlands named her Sidonia. After the series changed to Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands in 1964 the character was changed to her definitive name Sidonia. She even announces this to the readers at the start of the album \\"De Nerveuze Nervi√´rs\\" (\\"The Nervous Nervii\\") (1964). In English translations of the series, she has been called Aunt Agatha, Aunt Sidonia, and Aunt Sybil. Character Tante Sidonia is Suske and Wiske's guardian. Willy Vandersteen created her because, according to him, \\"a real mother would never allow her children to go on adventure like Suske and Wiske do\\".Van Hooydonck, Peter, \\"Willy Vandersteen: De Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1995. Despite that Sidonia still protects and defends them at all cost. Sidonia is an older, bespectacled woman who is thin and tall. She has a large chin, big nose, a huge quiff and big feet. Because of her unattractive physical features she is frequently mocked by other characters, especially Lambik. One of the most frequently uttered insults are comparisons between her and a coat stand. One of the running gags is that she often throws her shoe against the back of Lambik's head after he insulted her. Understandably, Sidonia feels very insecure about her appearance. During trips she often takes large trunks full with beauty measures along with her. In \\"De Jolige Joffer\\" (\\"The Jolly Joffer\\" (1986) she changes her face with a magical spell to become more attractive. In \\"Het Babbelende Bad\\" (\\"The Talking Bath\\") (2008) she visits a plastic surgeon. Sidonia is a spinster. She often tries to seduce other men, especially Lambik whom she secretly loves. In \\"De Lachende Wolf\\" (\\"The Laughing Wolf\\") (1952) she says she wouldn't go to Canada if Lambik asked her hand in marriage, a plea he ignores. In \\"Sjeik el Rojenbiet\\" (\\"Sheik Rojenbiet\\") (1963) Lambik imitates Ramon Novarro and tells Sidonia \\"I love you\\", which she takes seriously until he tells her he was only joking. In \\"De Poenschepper\\" (\\"The Money Shoveler\\") (1963) it is revealed that she built a secret shrine for Lambik, who has been missing for several months. While her love for Lambik remains unrequited - as stipulated in Vandersteen's testament \\\\- her search for a partner has sometimes been fruitful, but either the men turn out to be villains or her love for Suske, Wiske and her friends gets the upper hand. Sidonia is very bright. In several stories she comes up with ingenious plans to solve complicated problems and uses her slender body to good use. In \\"De Straatridder\\" (\\"The Street Knight\\") (1955) she hides herself completely behind a street light, while she startles a burglar in \\"De Lachende Wolf\\" (\\"The Laughing Wolf\\") (1952) by crawling up the stairs in snake-like fashion. She is also a master of disguise, as demonstrated in \\"De Stierentemmer\\" (\\"The Bull Tamer\\") (1950), \\"De Sissende Sampan\\" (\\"The Hissing Sampan\\") (1963) and \\"De Apekermis\\" (\\"The Monkey Fair\\") (1965). Still there are times when Sidonia's emotions get the better of her. When she takes her glasses off this is usually a sign that she is about to get incredibly angry. She also suffers from frequent nervous breakdowns where she starts screaming and jumps backward. Usually her entire body paralyzes or curves in the shape of a bow. In some stories she has to be calmed down with a mustard foot bath, smelling salts or a quick hospital visit. History Tante Sidonia debuted in the first unofficial Suske en Wiske story, \\"Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije\\" (1945), where she is already shown as Wiske's guardian. She adopts Suske in the next story Het Eiland Amoras (\\"The Isle of Amoras\\") (1946). In some older stories she is notably absent, but in other stories, such as \\"De Botte Botaknol\\" (1980-1981), \\"De Kattige Kat\\" (1984-1985), \\"De Flierende Fluiter\\" (2004-2005), \\"De Hippe Heksen\\" (1983) and \\"De Europummel\\" (2001-2002) she plays a central role. She is also a main character in the spin-off series Jerom and Amoras. While normally being a housewife Sidonia sometimes performs jobs. In \\"De Zwarte Zwaan\\" (\\"The Black Swan\\") (1958) she is a guide during the Brussels World's Fair in 1958. In \\"Beminde Barabas\\" (\\"Beloved Barabas\\") (1974-1975) she works as a plumber. Family Sidonia's father is a moustached man, which explains his nickname \\"De Snor\\" (\\"The Moustache\\"). In \\"De Snorrende Snor\\" (\\"The Purring Moustache\\") (1957) he lives in with Sidonia.\\"Suske en Wiske: De Snorrende Snor\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1957. In \\"De Tijdbobijn\\" (\\"The Time Bobbin\\") (2009) he moves in the castle of the Van Zwollem family. In \\"De Lachende Wolf\\" (\\"The Laughing Wolf\\") (1952) we learn that her nephew, John, became a fur trapper in Alaska and is married with a Native American woman, Big Snowbell. Sidonia's niece, Carmencita Falasol, is a Spanish operasinger who is married with inventor Don Jos√© del Rondello, with whom she has a toddler son, Sprotje.\\"Suske en Wiske: De Stierentemmer\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1957. Sidonia is of ancient noble ancestry. In \\"De Koning Drinkt\\" (\\"The King Drinks\\") (1947) we learn that a medieval woman who shares a physical resemblance to her was a royal warrant holder. At the end of the story she marries the king. In \\"De Stierentemmer\\" (\\"The Bull Tamer\\") (1952) the mayor of the fictional Spanish town Servela tells Sidonia that she is related to the Duke of Medina Sidonia, who was a real 16th century Spanish duke. Even in the 19th century Sidonia still has nobility in her family. In \\"De Tuf-Tuf Club\\" (1951) we get to know baron van Stiefrijke, another great-grandfather of her. Her grand aunt Eulalie van Stiefrijke, however, had serious debts, according to \\"Het Lijdende Leiden\\" (\\"The Suffering Leiden\\") (2011). In popular culture On June 15, 1995 an illustrated wall was dedicated to Suske and Wiske in the Laekenstraat in Brussels, Belgium. Sidonia is also seen on this wall.http://www.brussel.be/dwnld/40015738/BOB_et_BOBETTE.RUE_DE_LAEKEN.0374.JPG In the 1975-1976 Dutch TV puppet series Suske en Wiske Sidonia's voice was done by Trudy Libosan. In the 2004 live-action film \\"Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers\\" she was voiced by Sien Eggers. In live-action films and plays Sidonia is often portrayed by male actors rather than female. In the 1994 theatrical musical \\"De Stralende Sterren\\" (\\"The Blinking Stars\\") she was portrayed by Aim√© Anthoni, in the 2002 musical \\"De Spokenjagers\\" (\\"The Ghost Hunters\\") (2002) by Jeroen Maes http://www.discogs.com/Suske-En-Wiske-De- Spokenjagers/release/3520465 and in the live-action film ' (\\"The Dark Diamond\\") (2004) by Peter Van Den Begin. The only female actor to play the part so far was Wanda Joosten. In the Dutch educational comic strip series Van Nul tot Nu (1982), which tells the history of the Netherlands in comic book form, Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia is caricatured as Tante Sidonia as a nod to Suske en Wiske.Co Van Loerakker, Thom van Roep, \\"Van Nul tot Nu: Part I\\", 1982, Oberon/Big Balloon, page 51.

Panoramic view of Wedding Cake Rock's surrounds. The sandstone composition of the rock is distinct from surrounding cliffs. Wedding Cake Rock, also known as White Rock, is a sandstone rock formation located in the Royal National Park near Bundeena, New South Wales, Australia, accessible via the Royal National Park Coast Track. The rock is one of many formations that appear north of Marley Beach, and is suspended above sea level. Wedding Cake Rock is noted for its scenic location and popularity with bushwalkers and tourists, as an attractive location for photography. Its reputation, however, was damaged after the landmark saw a sudden spike in popularity in 2015, and subsequently fell victim to vandalism. The rock was closed off from public access in May 2015 by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, citing the dangerous behavior of recent visitors, and later, safety concerns, after a survey conducted the following month determined that the rock was unstable, and that it would collapse into the Tasman Sea within the next decade. Summary Wedding Cake Rock earned its name from its resemblance to a slice of a wedding cake; the feature shows layers and is unusually eroded into a perfectly cuboid shape, in addition to being white, similar to a wedding cake. The feature is one of many formations between Bundeena and Marley Beach, including The Balcony (Bundeena Lookout) and the adjacent \\"White Cliffs\\" of Marley. Before its closure from the public, travellers to Wedding Cake Rock were often advised not to stand near the edge of the cliff, mainly due to regularly strong winds. The rock can be reached by the Royal National Park Coast Track, a walking trail through the park that spans the entire length of the park's coastline, from Bundeena to Otford. Wedding Cake Rock is situated from the start of the trail at Bundeena. Contemporary history There has been one death at Wedding Cake Rock that has not been the result of erosion. A 24 year young French tourist and amateur climber jumped from the lower tier to grab the upper tier however slipped on impact losing traction causing him to fall more than 40 meters to his death. =Closure and aftermath= Southern view of part of the rock's structure in May 2016, showing visible signs of erosion underneath. Concerns about the rock's stability led to the landmark's closure by the NPWS the previous year. In early 2015, Wedding Cake Rock saw a sudden spike in popularity. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) reported the number of visitors per month on the Royal National Park Coast Track had sharply risen from the average of 2,000 per month to over 10,000. The social media photo sharing service Instagram has been cited as the cause for the growth in patronage, with users going to the landmark to take pictures on top of it, often while performing a stunt. The spike in popularity became concerning for the NPWS, whose regional manager, Gary Dunnett, questioned, \\"whether having 30 or 40 people standing on that area has the potential to tip it one way or the other\\". The site was closed off in May 2015, citing the aforementioned safety concerns. After the closure, a geotechnical assessment and evaluation of Wedding Cake Rock was conducted to determine the stability of the landmark. The study found, to the NPWS' surprise, that the formation was not only unstable, but was certain to collapse at any time within the next ten years, with the entire structure being described as \\"precariously balancing on the edge of the cliff, and severely undercut\\", seeming to be only upheld by very few pieces of debris from a recent major fracture below the rock. The closure of the landmark, however, did not deter visitors from jumping the safety fence established nearby and continuing to take photographs atop the unstable formation, prompting the NPWS to issue a $300 fine for visitors who do so, effective in late March 2016. This also did not prevent further instances of visitors jumping the fence, leading to the NPWS to collaborate with the New South Wales Police Force to start patrolling the area; an operation which began in June 2016. By July 2016 six fines had been officially issued by the NPWS since the rock's closure, with seven more being issued by July 2018. The rock will remain closed to the public until its eventual demise, though proposals by the NPWS advised establishing a permanent viewing platform near the landmark. As part of the New South Wales Government's 2016-17 state budget, the proposal was fully funded as part of a $9 million \\"windfall\\" granted to the NPWS over the subsequent 4-year period to upgrade the Royal National Park Coast Track.

They compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division III level and hold dual membership in both the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC) and the University Athletic Association (UAA). They are coached by Greg Debeljak. Home games are played at DiSanto Field. The team in its current form was created in 1970 after the federation of Western Reserve University and Case Institute of Technology. History =Mascot names= Case, originally known as Case School of Applied Science, carried the name Scientists from 1918 to 1939. In 1940, the mascot was changed to the Rough Riders, in honor of their head coach Ray A. Ride. Case formally updated their school name in 1947 to Case Institute of Technology. Western Reserve originally used the mascot Pioneers from 1921 to 1927, until being forced to change by Marietta College, who claimed earlier usage of the namesake. The famous Red Cats mascot was then used beginning in 1928. Upon the merger of the two schools, the Spartans name was adopted in 1970, as the team is now known. =Pre-merger (1890‚Äì1969)= Western Reserve played its first season in 1890 and Case began the following year in 1891. Physically bordering each other, the two schools became instant rivals. From 1894‚Äì1953, the rivalry game was played mostly on Thanksgiving Day, creating a Cleveland tradition. Due to high civic interest and large crowds, the games were often held at larger Cleveland city venues, such as League Park and Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Western Reserve led the all-time series 49‚Äì20‚Äì5. In 1892, Western Reserve declined Clevelander John Heisman's offer to be their head coach, and then ironically faced him and his Oberlin Yeomen during the season opener, getting destroyed 38‚Äì8.Umphlett, W. L. (1992) Creating the Big Game: John W. Heisman and the Invention of American Football. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 30. Western Reserve would have their revenge two years later in 1894, finally defeating Heisman while at home in Cleveland, ending the season with a 7‚Äì0 undefeated record. In fact, the team outscored opponents a combined 232‚Äì8, and posted five shutouts. Only Oberlin and Ohio State scored on Western Reserve that year. Michigan vs Case series occurred from 1894‚Äì1923, where Michigan hosted Case in sixteen home openers.http://mgoblue.com/news/2009/4/21/university_of_michigan_football_all_time_records_vs_opponents.aspx When the Ohio Athletic Conference was formed in 1902, Case dominated the early years winning its first four titles (1902‚Äì1905), posting a combined 18‚Äì1‚Äì1 league record, led by Chester Orrhttp://athletics.case.edu/sports/spartan_club/bios/orr_chester?view=bio and Peggy Parratt, a quarterback who would later throw the first forward pass in professional football history. The 1902 team scored the first touchdown against Michigan's legendary coach Fielding H. Yost, who began his coaching career posting twelve consecutive shutouts. In fact, the headline in the Detroit Free Press referred not to Michigan's victory but instead read, \\"MICHIGAN'S GOAL LINE CROSSED.\\" Western Reserve emerged to win league titles in both 1907 and 1908, and again in 1915. Finally in OAC play, Case would win two more titles‚Äîfirst in 1932, ironically losing only to Western Reserve who exited the conference in 1931‚Äîand another in 1941, again suffering their only loss to rival Western Reserve. Ohio State vs Case 11/9/1918. Military images were common on football programs during World War I. Western Reserve is the only Ohio team with a winning record, 6‚Äì5‚Äì1, against the Ohio State Buckeyes, playing from 1891‚Äì1934. Ohio State University's only death of a player from game-related injuries, team captain John Sigrist, occurred against Western Reserve in 1901. Case Tech holds a 10‚Äì11‚Äì2 all-time record against the Ohio State Buckeyes, with Coach Joe Fogg posting a perfect 4‚Äì0 record during his tenure. Famed Notre Dame coach, Knute Rockne, made his head coaching debut on September 28, 1918 against Case held at University Circle's Van Horn Field. George \\"The Gipper\\" Gipp led the Fighting Irish to a 26‚Äì6 victory rushing for two touchdowns. Although the home team could not play spoiler in his debut, Case lays claim to scoring the first touchdown against Rockne. The AP story recounted the scoring drive: \\"Case scored in the opening period when brilliant open field running by Hale and a forward pass, Hale to Wolf, placed the ball on Notre Dame's two-yard line. Capt. McCune plunged over.\\" In 1920, The Alabama Crimson Tide played their first ever game in the north at University Circle's Van Horn Field against Case, mainly due to coach Xen C. Scott, prior coach of both Case and Western Reserve, wanting to showcase his new team to the Cleveland audience.Edwards, Henry P. (November 10, 1920). \\"Case‚ÄìAlabama battle in this city clinched\\". The Plain Dealer (NewsBank: America's Historical Newspapers). p. 12. Cleveland had its own Big Four Conference, which was formed in 1933 consisting of Baldwin-Wallace, Case Tech, John Carroll, and Western Reserve. Some of the highest attended games in school history occurred during this decade, needing to be played at Cleveland Municipal Stadium and League Park to handle the larger crowds. The champion received the Douglas S. Campbell Trophy. Case Tech won the inaugural in 1933 and then Western Reserve won eight out of the next nine‚Äî1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, and 1942. The local tradition came to an end due to the interruption of World War II. The Bill Edwards era (1936‚Äì1941) propelled Western Reserve into the national spotlight, achieving three undefeated seasons (1935, 1936, and 1938), a 28-game win streak, and the school's only bowl game -- 1941 Sun Bowl, played Jan 1, 1941. The undefeated teams featured strong play from Ray Zeh, Frank \\"Doc\\" Kelker, Phil Ragazzo, Albie Litwak, Johnny Ries, Gene Myslenski, Mike Rodak, Dick Booth, and Johnny Wilson. During the 1935 college football season, Ray Zeh led the nation in scoring with 112 points. Over his six-year tenure, Coach Edwards guided the team to a 49‚Äì6‚Äì2 (0.877) record, earning a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame before heading off to coach the Detroit Lions. After a short hiatus during World War II, football resumed in 1946 where Western Reserve pushed hard to elevate the program to the national stage scheduling teams such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Rutgers, West Virginia, Marshall, Kent State, Miami of Ohio, Ohio University, Western Michigan, Colgate, Brown, and Duquesne. In 1946, Western Reserve became a charter member with the formation of the Mid-American Conference, in conjunction with Ohio University, Butler, Cincinnati, and Wayne State. Ohio‚Äôs first ever intercollegiate TV football game aired on October 23, 1948, where Western Reserve battled Kent State to a 14-14 tie. In 1954, Western Reserve withdrew from the MAC, citing the need for the school to focus more energy on academics and the high cost of running a big time program spearheaded by President John S. Millis.John Sayle Watterson (2002). \\"College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy\\". JHU Press. . In conjunction with reviving the Case Institute program who had disbanded in 1954, both teams helped form the Presidents' Athletic Conference as charter members in 1955, with Western Reserve winning conference titles in 1955, 1958, and 1960. =Post-merger (1970‚Äìpresent)= The football teams combined in 1970, a few years after the federation of the two universities. Both the Red Cats and Rough Riders names were dropped, and the new mascot, Spartans, was adopted. A new rivalry game emerged in 1970 against the Carnegie Mellon Tartans. In 1986, the annual game and trophy was officially dubbed the Academic Bowl. Another rivalry against the College of Wooster began in 1984, where the winner holds on to the Baird Brothers Trophy. The Spartans played in the PAC until 1983. The following season, they helped charter their fourth conference, the North Coast Athletic Conference. During the league's first year in 1984, the Spartans achieved a 9‚Äì0 undefeated season, winning the first conference title led by two-time All- American quarterback Fred DiSanto. The most successful coach by winning percentage in the post-merger era was Coach Jim Chapman, who amassed a 36‚Äì7‚Äì1 (0.830) record from 1982‚Äì1986, including a 14-game win streak. In conjunction with other top research universities in the country, Case Western Reserve University became a charter member of its fifth and final conference, the University Athletic Association, being joined by the football teams of University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Rochester in 1986. Conference titles were won in 1988 and 1996. The Spartans played as a member of both the NCAC and UAA, until finally departing the NCAC in 1999. In 2004, Coach Greg Debeljak moved into the head coaching role, where he set and holds the record for most wins in post-merger era history. Within a few years, the Spartans achieved three consecutive 10‚Äì0 undefeated seasons in (2007, 2008, and 2009), which helped set an all-time school record of a 38-game regular season win streak, leading to the school's first NCAA DIII playoff appearances (2007, 2008, and 2009) and playoff win (2007). Six UAA conference titles (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2016, and 2017) have been won. In 2017, he recorded another perfect 10‚Äì0 regular season, sharing the PAC conference title with Washington and Jefferson, also earning another playoff victory. Coach Greg Debeljak holds a 10‚Äì6 record against rival Carnegie Mellon. After a couple decade hiatus, the team rejoined the PAC in 2014 while retaining its membership in the UAA. Postseason and conference championships =Conference titles= A total of eleven undefeated seasons have been recorded‚ÄîWestern Reserve (1894, 1935, 1936, and 1938) and Case (1892, 1893) both while Independent and Case Western Reserve while in the NCAC or UAA (1984, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2017).

Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities.

Additionally, in 1881 restrictions on bill-posting (affichage) were lifted and eased state control of the media in France.Verhagen, The poster in Fin-de-Si√®cle Paris, p. 107Carter, Karen L. (2010). Unfit for public display: female sexuality and the censorship of fin‚Äêde‚Äêsi√®cle publicity posters, Early Popular Visual Culture, 8:2, 107-124 In 1884, the Paris city council started to rent out surfaces belonging to the municipality, paving the way for a rapid increase in the production and distribution of advertising posters. Posters with clear colours and dashing images appeared all over town during the vibrant spirit of the Belle √âpoque. L√©on and Alfred created the Ateliers Choubrac. Ateliers Choubrac, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France (BNF) As an illustrator, he sometimes collaborated with his brother in Gil Blas or the satirical weekly Le Courrier fran√ßais, among others. Choubrac illustrated several works by Emile Zola. Although Leon died young (1885), his brother Alfred went on to produce an impressive number of posters for Parisian entertainers, theatres, businesses and various commercial products.

History William \\"Willdabeast\\" Adams, who is originally from Indiana, began his more intense dance training in 2005 in cities like Indianapolis and Chicago. He then began to travel and attend many dance conventions like Monsters of Hip Hop, Pulse on Tour, and many others. A short three years later, Adams joined a local Indianapolis dance crew named \\"Destined 2 Be\\", and the crew went on to win the Indiana Black Expo two years in a row earning a perfect score at both appearances. Something like this had never been done in the history of the expo. Currently, Adams works heavily with the Millennium Dance Complex, chorographing heavily with his dance partner and wife Janelle Ginestra. Professional experience Just a short year later, Adams' crew gained national attention by making it through two rounds of America's Got Talent. This appearance led the crew to shows with groups like Breaksk8 and people like Jason Derulo. Adams' career slowly began to lift off from there as he began to book many more jobs and appeared in movies, commercials, short films, etc. In late 2009, Adams chose to move to Los Angeles, California to continue to establish his career. In 2010, he landed a job dancing on tour for rap artist T-Pain. He also, since moving to LA, got jobs choreographing for Nike commercials and as a guest choreographer on one of the most popular dance television series in America, So You Think You Can Dance. Recent expeditions In 2013, Adams created the immaBEAST dance company. He auditioned hundreds of the most talented dancers in Los Angeles and across the country but only about 60 dancers made the final cut. Adams' company immediately began producing videos and short films that have since gained millions of views and followers. The immaBEAST company has become one of the biggest hip hop brands in America and has also had a major influence on American dance culture as well Beginning in 2015, Adams incorporated the annual immaBeast audition into a workshop and training experience called the BuildaBeast Experience. The five day convention held in California every year consists of four days of workshops with some of the industry's top choreographers and the immaBeast audition on the fifth day. Each year, the convention's size keeps going from about 750 dancers the first year to over 1,000 dancers in over a year. His most recent venture has been the company's dance studio called IMMA S p a c e. It went live on 28 February 2017 with a dance routine to That's what I like by Bruno Mars.

It was built from 1860 to 1970. It is also known as Dawson Road Cemetery and Rockhampton Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 February 1993.  History  William Kidston, Queensland Premier, is buried in South Rockhampton Cemetery The South Rockhampton (Dawson Road) Cemetery was surveyed in May 1860 as the town's first official general cemetery, encompassing less than half its present area, and fronting the Dawson (now Lower Dawson) Road. The 1858 Rockhampton town plan had made no provision for a public cemetery and, prior to c.1860, burials took place near the Fitzroy River, between Albert and North Streets. The Dawson Road cemetery, sited on a principal arterial road out of early Rockhampton, was established when the population numbered less than 1,000, and just five years after the first settlers had arrived in the area in 1855. Rockhampton grew rapidly in the 1860s. Between 1861 and 1866 immigrant ships filled a desperate labour shortage, and the discovery of gold to the west of Rockhampton enticed large numbers of Europeans, Chinese and southern colonists to the district. The rapid growth of the town into a major regional centre in the 1860s-80s is reflected in the history of its principal 19th century cemetery. The first burials were in the early 1860s (the oldest surviving headstone is dated 1861). Nominally, burials were supervised by the Rockhampton Municipal Council, but not until 1864 did the Council commence a proper administration of the cemetery. In late 1864/early 1865 they appointed a sexton, formulated cemetery regulations, started a register of burials, laid out the grounds to represent the major religious denominations, and authorised the removal of remains from the old burial ground to the new. In late 1886 trustees were appointed under the 1865 Cemeteries Act. In 1867-68, french botanist Anthelme Thozet donated trees and seeds from his famous Kalka (North Rockhampton) experimental gardens to the cemetery. Although the cemetery had been in use for over a decade, it was not until 1872 that 3 hectares of the site were officially gazetted as a reserve for cemetery purposes. In 1880 the area was extended to nearly 13 hectares. The reserve then included all of the land bounded by Dawson and Upper Dawson Roads, and Prospect and Ferguson Streets. Prior to 1904 there were no burials west of the present north-south main cemetery path, as the ground was considered too rocky. For the same reason, few graves were dug east of the creek running through the cemetery. The resultant problems of overcrowding and shallow graves were exacerbated in 1900 with the outbreak of bubonic plague in the town. Later the Rockhampton Cemetery Trust acquired additional land in Norman Gardens, North Rockhampton, and in 1930 the cemetery reserve at South Rockhampton was gazetted as closed, excluding burials in plots purchased prior to 15 May 1930. In 1937 about 1.6 hectares of the reserve fronting the Lower Dawson Road was surrendered for public park purposes, no graves being identified on this site. In January 1964 the Rockhampton City Council was appointed trustee of the cemetery reserve. Burials ceased c.1970. On 19 June 1986 the Queensland Governor in Council rescinded the cemetery reserve gazettal, and the site remains as vacant crown land. Neither a c.1865 sexton's cottage, nor a Chinese incense burner is extant. The wrought iron entry gates and posts, which in 1864 were moved from Rockhampton's recreation ground to the cemetery, have been removed to the Japanese gardens. A New perimeter fence has been erected.  Notable burials  Over 22,000 persons were buried in the cemetery between 1860 and 1970, including Aboriginal, Chinese, German, Jewish and other ethnic groups, with memorials to sailors, miners, soldiers, members of religious orders, mayors, and many of Rockhampton's early inhabitants. The site survives as a significant reflection of the city's social, political and demographic history. Notable people buried in the cemetery include: * John Cani, Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton * Will Crompton, poet * Owen Daniel, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Sydney Davis, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Thomas Dunlop, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * James Flint, architect and alderman of the Rockhampton Municipal Council * Thomas Griffin, murderer * William Harding, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * William Higson, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * William Kidston, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, Queensland Premier (1908‚Äì11) * William Frederick Lambert, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council * James Larcombe, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * John MacFarlane, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Charles Melbourne, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council * Frank Reid Murphy, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Francis Hodgson Nixon, architect and newspaper proprietor and editor * Edward Palmer, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * William Pattison, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, Treasurer of Queensland * Frederick Shaw, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Joseph Shiel, Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton The cemetery contains two Commonwealth war graves, these being a soldier of the Australian Army from each of the two World Wars.  Description  South Rockhampton Cemetery is located on an easterly slope of The Range and covers the block bounded by Prospect Street, Upper Dawson Road and Ferguson Street with a landscaped park, tourist information centre and service station to the east side along the Bruce Highway. The cemetery is divided into denominational sections including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Congregational, Jewish and non- Judaeo-Christian by a main path leading north to south and a series of minor paths running east to west. There are approximately 2000 surviving headstones throughout these sections and many mounds of earth where graves exist, but the headstones have been removed. The graves form a terracing effect across the site with the exception of the non-Judaeo-Christian section where the burial traditions of the Chinese, Aboriginal and other groups left no visible memorial. A watercourse runs from the southwest corner through the Church of England section to the eastern perimeter. Some headstones exist within overgrown areas of this watercourse, including the only surviving cast iron headstone. A sandstone ridge surfaces within the watercourse, and a headstone dated 1862 is thought to have been quarried from the sandstone on this site, as it has a different grain and colouring to the local Stanwell sandstone used throughout the rest of the cemetery. Other types of local stone used include white Ulam marble from south of Rockhampton, black granite from west of Rockhampton and grey granite from near Gracemere. Imported stones include Harcourt granite from Victoria, porphyry from Brisbane, white Italian Carrara marble, pink Italian Rosa Porrino granite, Italian saudo grey granite, Baltic brown granite, Balmoral red granite from Finland and black slate from the Mediterranean. Most of the stonework has been undertaken locally by firms of monumental masons including Jenkins and Allen, Jenkins, Allen and McKenzie, with individual masons signing their work. There are some examples of pieces which have been imported fully sculptured. Architectural trends are reflected in some headstones which have Gothic, Classical and Art Nouveau influences. In many cases, grave surrounds are an integral part of the headstone design in creating a piece of sculpture. Labour intensive practices, particularly in the grave surrounds, seem to have been simplified in the interwar period, with cast concrete posts and curbs becoming common, the detailed carving being confined to the headstone or plaque. Notable plant species include Banyan trees (Ficus benghalensis) at the north entrance and in the centre, Hoop Pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina) along the north boundary, Cook Island (Araucaria cookii) and (Livistona drudei) palms to the southeast, and a native almond (Terminala porphyrocarpa sin. T.thozettii), named after A Thozet, which is located to the east. The adjoining landscaped park includes barbecue and playground facilities. Damage has occurred to some headstones through acts of vandalism, burning off or negligent mowing with stone or concrete surrounds being chipped.  Heritage listing  South Rockhampton Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 February 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. South Rockhampton Cemetery, established in 1860, is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland history in that it provides evidence of the history and demography of the Rockhampton district, particularly displaying the diversity of the town's cultural, religious and ethnic groups. It is important also in demonstrating architectural trends in monumental design over more than a century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The diverse collection of memorials, the grounds, the formal arrangement of graves, and the historically significant collection of plant species, exhibit particular aesthetic characteristics valued by the community generally, and in particular by persons interested in the demonstration of the craftsmanship of monumental masons and in the history of cemetery design and aesthetics. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a special association with persons of importance in Queensland history, and in the Rockhampton district, in particular William Kidston, Premier of Queensland (1908‚Äì11), and several mayors of Rockhampton.

It is used almost exclusively in babies because their fontanelle (the soft spot on the skull) provides an \\"acoustic window\\". A different form of ultrasound-based brain scanning, transcranial Doppler, can be used in any age group. This uses Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow through the major arteries in the brain, and can scan through bone. It is not usual for this technique to be referred to simply as \\"cranial ultrasound\\". Additionally, cranial ultrasound can be used for intra-operative imaging in adults undergoing neurosurgery once the skull has been opened, for example to help identify the margins of a tumour.Cranial Ultrasound article on the WedMD website http://www.webmd.com/brain/cranial-ultrasound Indications Most neonatal units in the developed world routinely perform serial cranial ultrasound scans on babies who are born significantly premature. A typical regimen might involve performing a scan on the first, third and seventh day of a premature baby's life, and then at regular intervals until the baby reaches term.NHS Forth Valley Cranial Ultrasound guideline http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/__documents/qi/ce_guideline_wcdneonatal/cranialuss.pdf Premature babies are especially vulnerable to certain conditions involving the brain. These include intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), which often occurs during the first few days, and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), which tends to occur later on. One of the main purposes of routine cranial ultrasound scanning in neonatal units is to identify these problems as they develop. If severe intraventricular haemorrhage is noted then the baby will need to be scanned more frequently in case post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus (swelling of the ventricles as the natural flow of the cerebrospinal fluid is blocked by blood-clots) develops. Many other conditions can also be identified by cranial ultrasound. These include: * Subdural haemorrhage (although this is usually only visible on ultrasound if quite large) * Abnormalities of brain development such as agenesis of the corpus callosum * Unexpected cysts or areas of calcification, which could indicate a problem such as infection of the foetus during pregnancy. * Brain tumours Therefore unwell mature babies often undergo cranial ultrasound as well as premature babies. Technique A water-based gel is applied to the infant's head, over the anterior fontanelle, to aid conduction of ultrasound waves. Ideally scans are performed during sleep or when the infant is calm. The operator then uses an ultrasound probe to examine the baby's brain, viewing the images on a computer screen and recording them as necessary. A standard cranial ultrasound examination usually involves recording approximately 10 views of the brain from different angles, five in the coronal plane and five in the sagittal or parasaggital planes.Auckland District Health Board Neonatal Cranial Ultrasound training resource This allows all parts of the ventricles and most of the rest of the brain to be visualised. Who performs the scans varies between different health systems. In many hospitals in the United Kingdom paediatricians or neonatologists usually perform cranial ultrasound; in other systems advanced nurse practitioners, radiologists or sonographers may perform most scans. While the anterior fontanelle is the most commonly used acoustic window for cranial ultrasounds, more advanced operators may gain additional views, especially of posterior fossa structures, by using the mastoid fontanelle, the posterior fontanelle and/or the temporal window.Lissauer T, Fanaroff AA, Miall L, Fanaroff J, \\"Neonatology at a Glance\\", p187, John Wiley & Sons, 2015 Other refinements of cranial ultrasound technique include serial measurement of the width of the lateral ventricles (\\"ventricular index\\") to monitor suspected ventricular dilatation and colour Doppler to assess blood flow. Limitations Cranial ultrasound is a very safe technique as it is non- invasive and does not involve any kind of ionising radiation. However, it is subject to certain limitations. * Operator dependency: the quality of images obtained relies on the skill of the person performing sonography. * Some brain structures are poorly visualised, notably posterior fossa structures such as the cerebellum if only the anterior fontanelle is used.van Wezel-Meijler, G, \\"Neonatal Cranial Ultrasonography\\" pp85-90, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007 * If the fontanelle is very small, for example is post-mature infants, scanning may be technically difficult. * Damage to the brain soft tissue (parenchyma), for example resulting from ischaemia or abnormal myelination, may be hard to see.van Wezel-Meijler G, Seggerda SJ, Leijser LM, \\"Cranial ultrasonography in neonates: role and limitations, Seminars in Perinatology, 34(1):28-38, 2010 Therefore many neonatal services prefer to perform an MRI scan when the infant is near term, as well as routine cranial ultrasound, to avoid missing more subtle abnormalities.

She kicked off and became a symbol of the women's movement in Japan when she organized activists to push for the legalization of the birth control pill. As a sign of respect for her elderly parents, Enoki was compelled to marry at the age of 24. She married physician Natsuo Kiuchi, retaining her maiden name. Enoki began her involvement with the Japanese women's liberation translation group known as Wolf Group (Urufu no Kai). She distributed a pamphlet calling for the legalization of the birth control pill, initially using the group's name, angering group members who did not share her position. Enoki attended the Ribu Conference of May 1972, recruiting women to form a protest group called Ch≈´piren (‰∏≠„ÉîÈÄ£; sometimes known as Pink Panthers or pink helmets) as a radical wing of the Japanese feminist movement. Ch≈´piren was an abbreviation for Ch≈´zetsu Kinshi H≈ç ni Hantai Shi Piru Kaikin o Y≈çky≈´ Suru Josei Kaih≈ç Reng≈ç (Women's Liberation Federation for Opposing the Abortion Prohibition Law and Lifting the Pill Ban). The group organized well-attended demonstrations for a series of campaigns addressing the concerns of women. Ch≈´piren was concerned with legal rights in divorce and marriage, access to birth control, abortion, and equal pay. Wearing pink hard hats to ensure maximal media attention, the demonstrators marched in white military-style uniforms. They held protest rallies and sit-ins and took part in publicity stunts such as confronting unfaithful husbands in their offices. The male-dominated media gave coverage to Ch≈´piren but did not take them seriously, instead ridiculing the movement. Enoki debated with Japanese feminist Mitsu Tanaka, who did not think that Ch≈´piren could be considered part of uuman ribu, the Japanese women's liberation movement. Enoki was not well trusted in the ribu and members of Ch≈´piren were critical of her style of leadership. Enoki formed the Japan Woman's Party (Nihon Joseit≈ç) for the 1977 House of Councillors election. The party put forward 10 to 12 candidates in the election and fared poorly, receiving only 0.4 per cent of the popular vote. Following the election, Ch≈´piren was disbanded and Enoki left public life. Enoki's husband lent her $38,000 to help finance the 1977 political campaign of the Japan Women's Party. They struck a bargain where she would resume housework at their apartment in suburban Tokyo and he would write off $2,670 of the loan for each month of housework.

Talk presented at the International Linguistic Association's 55th annual conference, New Paltz, N.Y. Handout. Sound patterns historically associated with Western New England English include the features of rhoticity (full pronunciation of all r sounds), the horse‚Äìhoarse merger, and the father‚Äìbother merger, none of which are features traditionally shared in neighboring Eastern New England English. The status of the cot‚Äìcaught merger in Western New England is inconsistent, being complete in the north of this dialect region (Vermont), but incomplete or absent in the south (southern Connecticut), with a \\"cot‚Äìcaught approximation\\" in the middle area (primarily, western Massachusetts). Western New England English is relatively difficult for most American laypersons and even dialectologists to identify by any \\"distinct\\" accent when compared to its popularly recognized neighbors (Eastern New England English, New York City English, and Inland Northern U.S. English), meaning that its accents are typically perceived as unmarked \\"General American\\" varieties. Linguistic research, however, reveals that Western New England English is not simply one single or uniform dialect. Linguist Charles Boberg proposes that it be most generally divided into a Northwestern New England English (a standalone \\"Vermont\\" accent) and a Southwestern New England English (a less advanced subdialect of Inland Northern English);Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; Boberg, Charles (1997). \\"Dialects of the United States.\\" A National Map of The Regional Dialects of American English. University of Pennsylvania. however, even Boberg lists the possibilities of several distinct accent divisions of Western New England. Vocabulary Vocabulary features that predominate in Western New England English include grinder for sub (submarine sandwich),Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. \\"What do you call the long sandwich that contains cold cuts, lettuce, and so on?\\" The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Linguistics Department. and tag sale for garage sale (predominant in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts).Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. \\"Which of these terms do you prefer for a sale of unwanted items on your porch, in your yard, etc.?\\" The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Linguistics Department. Overview of phonology Some Western New England speakers show the \\"generating conditions\\" for the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (or NCVS: the defining feature of the Great Lakes region's modern dialect) in backing of (to ), possible fronting of to , and tensing all instances of to something like . Though actually variable, these features occur among Western New England speakers just enough to suggest that they may be the \\"pivot conditions\\" that influenced the NCVS in the Inland North, likely beginning in the early twentieth century. The English of Western New England in fact shows many sharp differences throughout rather than one uniform accent. In 2001, Charles Boberg, discussing that Western New England English was a likely direct influence on the Inland Northern English of the Great Lakes region, still identified as many as four or five English sub-regional accents within Western New England itself, based on data from the late 1990s: *Northwestern Vermont (centered on Burlington) shows no raising of (except before nasal consonants), and therefore stays back in the mouth, leading to a cot‚Äìcaught merger to […ë]; this whole process consistently follows the logic of the Canadian Shift of Standard Canadian English. *Southwestern Vermont (centered on Rutland) shows a universal raising to and fronting to , but then oversteps and defies the logical direction of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift by producing a cot‚Äìcaught merger to […ëÃà]. *Western Massachusetts (centered on Springfield) shows a universal raising to and fronting to , following the logic of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, except that it tends towards a cot‚Äìcaught merger to , which is especially completed among younger speakers. *Central Connecticut (centered on Hartford) shows a universal raising to and fronting to , and thus avoiding the cot‚Äìcaught merger; this whole process consistently follows the logic of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. *Coastal Connecticut (centered on New Haven), in the above respects, appears to have more in common with New York City English, including a clear absence of the cot‚Äìcaught merger. Charles Boberg argues that Northwestern New England (Vermont) English, due to its cot‚Äìcaught merger but failure to demonstrate other features of the Eastern New England dialect, must be considered as its own separate dialect. On the other hand, in discussing Southwestern New England English as its own unique dialect, he instead proposed that it be regarded as a \\"subtype\\" of the Inland North dialect, based on the aforementioned commonalities, even if variable, such as the universal raising of the short a and no cot‚Äìcaught merger. However, some younger Southwestern New England speakers have diverged away from both of these features, which Boberg at least partly foresaw; such variables are discussed in greater detail below.  Northwestern New England Northwestern New England English, popularly recognized as a Vermont accent, is the most complete or advanced Western New England English variety in terms of the cot‚Äìcaught merger, occurring largely everywhere in that area north of Northampton, Massachusetts, towards .Seven of the eight Vermont speakers in a recent study from Labov, Ash, and Boberg fully merged the two vowels: Today, speakers documented in Burlington (northwestern Vermont) and Rutland (southwestern Vermont) show consistent fronting of before , therefore towards , in words like car or barn. The first element of (e.g. in \\"goat\\") is similar to with a low and lax first element, and sometimes with no glide as monophthongal . =Burlington= Northwestern Vermont (centered on Burlington) shows no raising of (except before nasal consonants), and therefore stays back in the mouth, leading to a cot‚Äìcaught merger to […ë]; this whole process follows the logic of the Canadian Shift of Standard Canadian English. =Rural Vermont= Since the mid- twentieth century, Vermont speakers have largely avoided stigmatized local features, and now follow the rhotic r of the rest of Western New England. However, before this time, the eastern edge of Vermont spoke Eastern New England English, even dropping the r sound everywhere except before vowels, just like in traditional Boston or Maine accents.Stanford, James N.; Leddy- Cecere, Thomas A.; Baclawski Jr., Kenneth P. \\"Farewell To The Founders: Major Dialect Changes Along The East-West New England Border.\\" American Speech 87.2 (2012): pp. 126-169. Communication & Mass Media Complete. Web. 2 Nov. 2015. p. 161 These speakers may retain vestigial elements of Eastern New England's trap-bath split, backing and lowering in certain environments. Today, a dwindling, generally rural, older, and male segment of the northern Vermont population uniquely pronounces with a raised starting point as (e.g. in \\"cows\\"; ) and (e.g. in \\"lie\\") with a backer, raised, or somewhat more rounded starting point as . A deep retroflex approximant for \\"r\\" may be noted among rural northern speakers, perhaps inherited from West Country or Scots-Irish ancestors, due to such immigrants largely settling in western New England (though not as much in eastern New England). One notable lifelong native speaker of the rural Vermont accent was Fred Tuttle. =Rutland= Southwestern Vermont (centered on Rutland) shows a universal raising to and fronting to , but then oversteps and defies the logical direction of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift by producing a cot‚Äìcaught merger to . The universal raising is most consistently recorded in speakers born before 1950; those born since 1960 show somewhat less raising. Southwestern New England Southwestern New England English is centered primarily around Hartford, CT and Springfield, MA. Its older speakers show more instances of universal tensing of the short a , while younger speakers show the more General American feature of tensing this vowel only before nasal consonants. The Atlas of North American English confirms that this raising phenomenon is highly variable in the region, though studies agree that raising always occurs strongest before nasal consonants. Regarding the cot‚Äìcaught merger, Southwestern New England speech has historically lacked the merger, before entering a transitional state of the merger in the mid-1900s. A \\"cot‚Äìcaught approximation\\" now prevails especially in Springfield and western Massachusetts, but is variable from one speaker to the next with no apparent age-based correlation, except that the youngest speakers now are tending to demonstrate a full merger. Local, especially working-class speakers of southwestern Connecticut (especially Greater Bridgeport and New Haven) and the Albany area of New York State, strongly influenced by nearby New York City dialect, continue to resist the cot‚Äìcaught merger. =Hudson Valley= Though not belonging geographically to New England, New York State's Hudson Valley speaks a sub-type of Southwestern New England English (best studied in Albany, New York), demonstrating additional influence from New York City English. Albany English shows Southwestern New England English's slight backing of (to ) and possible fronting of to , but New York City's caught vowel and, though having a continuous short-a system, still shows influence from New York City's short-a split system. Also, Albany starts fairly back and somewhat forward in the mouth . Notes References  Stanford, James. 2019. New England English: Large-scale acoustic sociophonetics and dialectology.

Majic Window offers an array of different home improvements, from front door installation to siding replacement. They are best known for their replacement fiberglass home windows; Majic Window is the world's largest distributor of fiberglass windows. History Bart and Rod Rue established Maijc Windows in 1997. At the time Majic was not selling fiberglass windows, but that would soon change. In 2001 Majic introduced the state of Michigan to fiberglass windows and began to install them in homes. Two years later in 2003, Majic became the world's largest distributor of fiberglass windows. In 2005 Mort Crim signed on to become Majic's goodwill ambassador. Crim is a retired anchorman who was well known in the city of Detroit. Will Ferrell cited Mort Crim as one of his inspirations for the fictional character Ron Burgundy. In 2006 fiberglass composite producer Owens Corning chose Majic to represent them in Michigan. In 2007 Majic Window relocated to their current corporate headquarters in Wixom, Michigan. In 2014 Majic won Consumer Energy's E3 Energy Efficiency Award. Products Majic's most popular product is their fiberglass framed window. Majic also offers entry door, flooring, siding, tub liner, walk-in tubs, and deck installation. Flooring includes hardwood, laminate, and carpet options. = Fiberglass windows = Fiberglass windows are an alternative to the traditional wood and vinyl windows found on many homes. Fiberglass windows are typically more expensive than vinyl or wood windows, but they do have their benefits. According to the US Department of Energy, outperforms wood and uninsulated vinyl in terms of energy efficiency. In general, fiberglass has been found to be more impact-resistant than any other replacement window material on the market. A case study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that fiberglass outlives vinyl and wood by as much as 38%. Majic fiberglass windows are manufactured from pultruded fiberglass. They can be painted any color and come in a variety of different shapes and styles. = Fiberglass entry doors = Wood doors warp in the winter and steel doors often lack charm and decorative appeal. Majic offers a solution to these problems by producing entry doors made out of the same fiberglass they make their windows with. Majic doors don't crack, warp, or rot, and they come in a variety of different design options. However, fiberglass doors come with a higher price tag in comparison to other entry door products. = Walk-in tubs = Majic uses a safety-first approach for their tub design. Majic walk-in tubs come equipped with a slip-resistant tub floor, easy-grip handles, a slip-resistant contoured seat, and a retractable shower head. Majic tubs are primarily designed for the elderly, but there are benefits for those of all ages. Because Majic tubs come with a built-in inline heater and hydrotherapy capabilities, using a Majic tub could promote healthier skin, increased blood flow, and a reduction in stress. = Tub liners = Majic tub liners are a quick and easy solution to bathroom upgrades. A bathroom makeover typically takes several days to complete. Majic liners install over the existing tub and wall system so the installation only takes a day. Installing tub lining can be a much more cost effective way to remodel a bathroom. Tub liners can be up to 40% less expensive than a full bathroom remodel. Because of the nature of tub liners, they don't fix problems, they simply cover them up. If you have existing moisture issues with your tub, then it's best just to invest in a complete remodel. = Insulation = The U.S. Department of Energy recommends that Michigan homes have an attic insulation R-value of R49 to R60 to be as energy-efficient as possible. Many Michigan homes are insulated with rolls or batts which typically have R-values ranging from R13 to R21. Majic blown-in fiberglass insulation helps homes become more energy efficient by further preventing heat from escaping through the attic. Majic blown-in insulation is produced with the same fiberglass resin all of Majic's other fiberglass products are made with. = Flooring = Majic offers three different flooring options: hardwood, laminate, and carpet flooring. Majic's hardwood is manufactured in the US and finished with Scotchgard Protector‚Ñ¢ by 3M. Majic laminate flooring offers the timeless hardwood look at a more affordable price point. Majic laminate flooring is installed with Silent GUARD underlayment from Mohawk. Majic carpet is made with SmartStrand‚Ñ¢ technology, a relatively new approach to carpet flooring invented and manufactured by DuPont. With SmartStrand technology, 700 silk- like fibers are packed into just one yarn. This density allows the carpet to maintain its appearance and soft texture for several years. = Composite decking = Michigan weather can take a large toll on traditional wood decks. Majic installs composite decks to combat the effects of winter weather. With composite material, there's no worrying about warps, rots, or bends in the board. Majic composite decks are produced with 95% recycled materials. = Seamless siding = One of the biggest issues with home siding is its propensity for rotting and warping at the seams. Majic manufactures and installs seamless siding to prevent these common siding issues. Majic is the exclusive provider of vinyl seamless siding in Southeast Michigan. With a classic wood-like appearance, Majic seamless siding is accepted in certain historical districts where traditional vinyl siding is not. = Metal roofing = As of 2016 Majic has started installing metal roofing under the brand name Michigan Metal Roofing. Majic installs metal tiles, shakes, and shingle all produced by Decra. Metal is the perfect material for Michigan roofs, because metal reflects heat and repels snow. Competitors There are several home improvement and window installation companies within Michigan. Majic's biggest competitors include Hansons, WeatherGard, Wallside Windows, and Andersen.

The album cover artwork features a highly satirical cartoon by Olaf Jens depicting noticeably gleeful revivified zombies who, on this occasion, have returned from \\"rock and roll heaven\\" on \\"retro\\" flying saucers and are targeting their customary victims: followers of supposedly \\"heretical\\" genres of music which have come to prominence over the years, which in this case include heavy metal, hardcore punk (with the insinuation that it is not \\"true\\" punk), rap, and modern pop-country‚Äîall done with a noticeable disdain for iPhones, music downloads, and other popular specimens of current technology and fashion (i.e. \\"exposed undies\\"), but are presented as \\"minor figures\\" in Jens' Sistine Chapel-like diorama depicting a global TNT-blasted apocalypse initiated as a result of the zombies' \\"scorched earth\\" policy of \\"cleansing\\" in their quest to permanently re-establish the reign of \\"true\\" rock & roll. The album begins with the driving protopunk of \\"Circuit Breaker,\\" by the Pastels, from Pasco, Washington. The High Spirits from Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, follow with a version of the Zombies' \\"It's Alright With Me,\\" which at midpoint shifts from a slow tempo accelerating in cadence, then rising to an organ-drenched climax consummated by a bee-sting guitar solo accompanied by cathartic screams. The Emeralds from Greenwood, Indiana are featured on the gritty blues-based \\"Like Father Like Son,\\" which recounts a woeful tale partially based on A Tale of Two Cities, by Victorian novelist Charles Dickens, in which the character Jerry Cruncher is a porter by day and a grave robber at night, whose lyrics snidely remark: \\"...my son goes to the church where they wear the black capes where you're taught not to have your fun...\\" Also included is the 1965 demo acetate version of \\"It's a Cry'n Shame\\" by The Gentlemen, from Dallas, Texas.

It is the successor of a former eponymous radio show, which had over the course of ten years been hosted by Ken Jebsen, aired from 2001 to 2011 on the youth channel Radio Fritz of Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB). Despite its popularity the show abruptly came to an end, after an email containing anti-semtic statements by Jebsen was released. According to the RBB Ken Jebsen had \\"repeatedly disregarded binding agreements\\", consequently co-operation was ended on 23 November 2011 and the program was discontinued permanently. Since the program's relaunch on a freelance basis as web portal and YouTube channel in spring 2012, KenFM has been producing news reports, interviews, talk-shows, political comments and analyses on a regular basis. The portal is mainly known for publishing \\"alternative views\\" and conspiracy theories, such as about the 9/11 attack or the Coronavirus pandemic. History =Radio Fritz= On Saturday, April 28, 2001 KenFM aired for the first time from a fashion boutique in Berlin as the show changed its place several times over the course of the following years. Further noticeable publication stations are the Peugeot Avenue (Unter den Linden, Berlin-Mitte), Mini-Berlin (Friedrichstrasse, Berlin-Mitte) and the Sony Center (Potsdamer Platz, Berlin-Tiergarten). The show soon received widespread acclaim by critics for its unconventional style \\"dedicated to intelligent madness and playing with the twisted spoken word\\". In an article in March 2004 titled \\"Neuroscience instead of Quiz Show\\" the TAZ newspaper, disillusioned with the \\"...particularly pathetic example of German Radio programming\\", highlights the contrasts and portrays the audience's approval of its authenticity - \\"four hours live, no rehearsal [...] a game based on science, history, philosophy and the arts. Brain research and nuclear physics instead of Super Contest and senseless advertising\\". Eventually KenFM broadcast every Sunday afternoon from Fritz Studios in Potsdam-Babelsberg. In addition to occasional live shows in the field, recordings of events that did not fit in the four hour live air-time or did not take place on Sundays were separately published. Excerpts of the show were offered as podcast since January 2006. Since March 2006 the KenFM podcast also offered the Fritz.de playlist. Concerts and musical performances were recorded and filmed and a video of the appearance produced plus interviews with bands or band members and published at FritzTV on Fritz.de the following days and a YouTube channel labeled KenFM2008 was established. =Deposition= In early November of 2011 an email of Ken Jebsen was published by author Henryk M. Broder, who criticized it for containing anti-Semitic statements. In the email Jebsen states among other remarks that he knows \\"who invented the Holocaust as a PR stunt\\", he insinuates a connection between Joseph Goebbels, PR-pioneer Edward Bernays, the CIA as well as rich \\"Jews\\" such as Henry Kissinger. RBB initially defended Jebsen against the allegation and on November 9 it was decided to carry on with Ken Jebsen, who was instructed to \\"sensibly check future political issues\\". However, on 23 November 2011 RBB suspended his show and he was eventually dismissed after it had been surmised, that he had violated the broadcaster's journalistic standards on a number of occasions. Although he did not deny having written the email, Jebsen has repeatedly dismissed any allegations of Antisemitism as absurd. =KenFM as an internet portal= The first 90-minute program was published on April 1, 2012 Sunday 14 O'clock based on the former radio show format and initially designated as \\"CamFM\\", produced in audio and video and presented free of charge on various video portals. Known RBB features and broadcast components were taken over, continued and further developed. In addition, audio publications on current topics are being irregularly published since. KenFM is funded exclusively by viewer's donations. KenFM mainly publishes \\"alternative viewpoints\\" on contemporary issues and news. The portal is mostly known for publishing a wide range of conspiracy theories. This includes conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation or the COVID-19 pandemic. Criticism Ken Jebsen and the KenFM outlet are regularly subjected to harsh criticism. During his early days after the dismissal from the RBB, he was defended by some commenters. For example some authors like Evelyn Hecht-Galinski argued that criticism has \\"gone beyond all measures\\" with respect to the fact that the wider debate on the Holocaust, antisemitism and related subjects requires restraint and a high degree of decency in Germany. However, with KenFM mainly publishing disproved conspiracy theories, mainstream media warns of the danger of his disinformation spreading, especially in the light of serious topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Political scientist Markus Linden labels Ken Jebsen, who he says preaches anti-Americanism under the name KenFM. He argues that KenFM is characterized by \\"sermonic monologues or long interviews with alternative war reporters, apostates, or marginal politicians and conspiracy theorists.\\" Wolfgang Storz, former chief editor of the Frankfurter Rundschau uses the term \\"political-journalistic Querfront network (politisch- publizistisches Querfront-Netzwerk)\\" in a controversial analysis for the Otto Brenner Foundation. Storz identifies KenFM as to be one of the protagonists \\"of persons and organisations who form a political-journalistic Querfront network, in which traditional Left-Right wing categories do no longer apply. The network's most striking feature is its activism against the elite\\", the government and the associated media (Systemmedien).

In 2017 he completed the Swaminarayan Bhashyam, a five-volume classical Sanskrit commentary on the Prasthanatrayi. This commentary on Hinduism's three canonical texts: the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma sutras, forms the interpretive foundation of the philosophy of Akshar Purushottam darshana, also known as Swaminarayan darshana, illuminating the Vedic roots of the Akshar Purushottama philosophy, which was propagated by the 19th-century Hindu leader, Swaminarayan and later by Shastriji Maharaj. The commentary discusses the basis of the five \\"eternal entities\\" - Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma and Parabrahman - as expounded by Swaminarayan. It also expands on the concept of Aksharbrahma and Parabrahman as well as the attainment of liberation (moksha) through devotion (bhakti) and worship (upasana). Following the tradition of the classical Sanskrit commentaries by Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, and Madhvacharya, the Swaminarayan Bhashyam is the second classical Sanskrit commentary on the entire Prasthanatrayi to have been completed by anyone in the last several centuries. After receiving a Ph.D. in Sanskrit from Karnakata University in 2005, he was awarded a D. Litt. in 2010 and the Mahamahopadhyaya honorific by Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University in Nagpur, India. The University of Mysore also awarded him the \\"Professor G.M. Memorial Award\\" and the \\"Darshankesari award\\" in 2013 for his work on Swaminarayan vedanta. He currently serves as the head scholar (\\"PradhƒÅnƒÅcƒÅrya\\") of the Yagnapurush Sanskrit Pathshala in Sarangpur, Gujarat, where the students are instructed by him in philosophy, nyaya dar≈õana, vedas, the Paninian grammar of Sanskrit and Indian classical music.  Early life  Bhadreshdas Swami was initiated as a renunciant (swami) of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha by his guru Pramukh Swami Maharaj in 1981 at the age of 14, Afterwards, he attended the BAPS seminary for swamis in Sarangpur, Gujarat, where he learned Swaminarayan Vedanta as well as the philosophical system of logic (nyaya) and Sanskrit grammar (vyakaran).  Education  Bhadreshdas Swami received five M.A. degrees in Sanskrit and Shad Darshanas from Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, in Benaras, India, and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Mumbai, India in 1996. In 2005, he received his Ph.D. from Karnataka University, based on his dissertation on the Bhagavad Gita.  Scholarly work  Bhadreshdas Swami has conducted extensive research on the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. He was a project committee member of the Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Ved-vidya Pratishthan (MSRVVP). He also serves as an advisor to students of Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy in his roles as a professor at the BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute in New Delhi, and Shree Somnath Sanskrit University in Veraval, Gujarat. Bhadreshdas Swami also serves as the head scholar at the Yagnapurush Sanskrit Pathshala in Sarangpur, Gujarat, where he instructs students in philosophy, Nyaya Darshana, Vedas, the Paninian grammar of Sanskrit and Indian classical music composed for the tabla, flute and violin. His administrative roles include service on the managing committee of the BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute at Akshardham in New Delhi. He is currently writing commentaries on the Vedas. = Swaminarayan Bhashyam = Swaminarayan Bhashyam The Swaminarayan Bhashyam is a commentary (or bhashya), on the ten Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma sutras, which are collectively referred to as the prasthanatrayi (three sources). It is composed in the traditional commentarial style of the classical Sanskrit commentaries written by Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, and Madhvacharya. Just as these commentaries establish the vedantic schools of thought of their respective acharyas, the Swaminarayan Bhashyam elaborates Swaminarayan's philosophical principles seen in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma sutras. The commentary is the first of its scope written in the 21st century. Through a careful study of every verse (shloka) in the three sources, it establishes a basis for the five \\"eternal realities\\" expounded by Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut, namely: Jiva (soul/life), Ishwar (deity), Maya, Aksharbrahma (Brahman) and Parabrahman (Parabrahman). It clarifies the relationship of Aksharbrahman to Parabrahman and Swaminarayan's principle for attaining liberation through the practice of bhakti and upasana.  Creation of the Swaminarayan Bhashyam  Bhadreshdas Swami presenting the Swaminarayan Bhashyam to Pramukh Swami Maharaj After earning his doctorate in Sanskrit, Bhadreshdas Swami was asked by his guru, Pramukh Swami Maharaj in 2005 to write a Sanskrit commentary on the Prasthanatrayi. Bhadreshdas worked on the commentary in a small room located in the basement of the BAPS seminary of Sarangpur, Gujarat, India. In June 2007, the village of Sarangpur was struck by a flash flood, inundating his workspace and resulting in the loss of approximately 2500 pages of his original work and notes. These notes contained information regarding the acharyas' arguments and definitions of philosophical components and the initial chapters of the Brahmasutra Bhashyam. His deadline for completing the Bhashyam, the centenary celebration of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha in December 2007, was six months away but his original work was unsalvageable. With the deadline fast approaching, Pramukh Swami Maharaj gave Bhadreshdas Swami blessings to start over. Working approximately 20 hours per day, he completed the Swaminarayan Bhashyam on schedule. On 17 December 2007, at the BAPS Centenary Celebrations in Ahmedabad, Bhadreshdas presented the completed five-volume 2,150-page work to his guru.  Critical reception  Swaminarayan Bhashyam The work has since been regarded by scholars of Indian philosophy as a significant commentary in the Prasthantrayi commentary tradition. Philosophy professor S.P. Dubey from the University of Jabalpur considers it to be the fifteenth major commentary in the tradition of Brahmasutra commentaries, which dates back to Shankaracharya (788-820 CE). Krishnamurti Shastri from the Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan of India says that the \\"poetic commentary presents new insights into the secrets of Vedanta in comparison to any previous views on the subject\\". N. Radhakrishna Bhat, Sanskrit professor at the Karnataka State Open University, has stated, \\"By reading this commentary we will come to the conclusion that the Swaminarayan tradition is an independent one on Akshar Purushottama Siddhanta based on the Vedic tradition which is quite ancient. It is quite a different one and has its own specialty. It greatly differs from Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita, Vallabhadeva's Suddhadvaita and the philosophy of Madhva, Nimbarka etc. It brings out greatly the special features and principles of the Siddhanta very effectively‚Ä¶ in accordance to the eternal Vedic principles conveyed by Bhagwan Shri Swaminarayana and the enlightened Guruparampara.\\" V.S. Vishnu Potty, of the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Culture at the Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Viswa Mahavidyalaya, states that \\"this new interpretation opens our eyes to a new horizon in this field of knowledge, in an objective manner.\\" The dean of the Arts faculty at the University of Delhi has stated that \\"This volume is prepared in faultless Sanskrit and a lucid style. Swaminarayan Bhashya is really a distinct contribution through a fresh approach to the old Brahmasutra commentaries...It is my sincere opinion that the BrahmaSutra Swaminarayan Bhashya is a well- researched work. I believe, Brahmasutra Swaminarayan Bhashya will be an important addition to the field of Vedanta philosophy and will be warmly received in India and abroad.\\" The work was also added into the Library of Congress by Democratic whip Steny Hoyer. During this ceremony, Hoyer said that \\"Surely these commentaries written by [Bhadreshdas Swami] will bring peace and blessings to the millions who will read and benefit from them\\".  Acclamation by Shri Kashi Vidvat Parisad  On 31 July 2017, Bhadreshdas Swami and his work on the Swaminarayan-Siddhant-Sudha was acknowledged by the Shri Kashi Vidvat Parisad. Throughout India, the Shri Kashi Vidvat Parisad is an authoritative council on all matters pertaining to Vedic dharma and philosophy. The council's gathering was marked by four declarations: First, that the Prasthanatrayi Swaminarayan Bhashyam and the Swaminarayan-Sidhhant- Sudha are sacred texts on Parabrahman Swaminarayan's revealed Akshar Purshottam Darshana; and that these sacred texts are in every manner the protectors of the eternal Vedic religious tradition. Second, that Bhadreshdas Swami is an acharya and a contemporary commentator in the lineage of commentators on the Prasthanatrayi. Third, that within philosophy, it is valid to identify Swaminarayan's Vedanta by the title Akshar-Purshottam Darshana. Fourth, that all members of the Shri Kashi Parisad endorse the Akshar Purshottam Siddhant, revealed by Parabrahma Swaminarayan as distinct from Advaita, Vishistadvaita, and all other doctrines and is indeed a Vedic Siddhanta. = Swaminarayan Siddhanta Sudha = On 17 September 2017, Mahant Swami Maharaj inaugurated the Swaminarayan-Siddhanta-Sudha, a text authored by Bhadreshdas. This text is a vadagrantha, or a formal exposition, justification and defense of the philosophical and theological positions of a darshan. This specific vadagrantha is composed on the Akshar-Purshottam Darshan. It presents a sophisticated treatment of the philosophical principles of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. = Awards = In recognition of his work on the commentary, the Kavikulguru Kalidas Sanskrit University in Nagpur, India, awarded Bhadreshdas Swami a D. Litt. in 2010, then in 2012, the title Mahamahopadhyaya (an honorific recognition awarded by the Indian government to prestigious scholars), the highest academic honor bestowed by that institution. He has also received the \\"Professor G.M. Memorial Award\\" from the University of Mysore and the \\"Darshankesari award\\" in 2013 for this work. At the World Sanskrit Conference in Bangkok in 2015, he was awarded the \\"Vedant Martand Sanman\\" by Silpakorn University in Thailand.
