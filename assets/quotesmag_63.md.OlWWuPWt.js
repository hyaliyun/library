He was mayor of Saint John, New Brunswick in 1877 and 1878. He was born in Kingston, New Brunswick, the son of Sylvester Zobieski Earle and Maria Hughson, and studied medicine at the University of the City of New York. In 1845, Earle returned to New Brunswick and joined his father in practice at Hampton. In 1847, he married Catherine McGill Otty, the sister of judge George Otty. In 1857, he was named county coroner. He also served as surgeon with the local militia. Earle helped lead the reconstruction efforts following the great fire in Saint John in June 1877.

There were two other NASA space communication networks at the time, the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN) for tracking satellites in low Earth orbit, and the Deep Space Network (DSN) for tracking more distant unmanned missions. After the end of Skylab, the MSFN and STADAN were merged to form the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN). STDN was in turn replaced by the satellite-based Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) during the Space Shuttle program, being used .  Orbital versus deep space tracking  Tracking vehicles in low Earth orbits (LEO) is quite different from tracking deep space missions. Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth's surface, and so require few stations (the DSN uses only three, ). These few stations, however, require the use of huge antennas and ultra-sensitive receivers to cope with the very distant, weak signals. Low Earth orbit missions, on the other hand, are only visible from a small fraction of the Earth's surface at a time, and the satellites move overhead quickly, which requires a large number of tracking stations, spread all over the world. The antennas required for LEO tracking and communication are not required to be as large as those used for deep space, but they must be able to track quickly. These differing requirements led NASA to build a number of independent tracking networks, each optimized for its own mission. Prior to the mid-1980s, when the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) satellites became operational, NASA used several networks of ground-based antennas to track and communicate with Earth orbiting spacecraft. For the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions, these were the primary means of communication, with the Deep Space Network (DSN) being assigned a supporting/backup role. Mercury MSFN stations Project Mercury MSFN stations Recreation of Mercury Control Center The Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN) stations during Gordon Cooper's 1963 Mercury flight were: *Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDS), California *Coopers Island, Bermuda (BDA) *Maspalomas Station, Grand Canary Island (CAN) *Guaymas, Mexico (GYM) *Kano, Nigeria (KAN) *Kauai, Hawaii (HAW) *Canton Island, Republic of Kiribati (CTN) *Mercury Control Center (CNV), Cape Canaveral, Florida *White Sands, New Mexico (WHS) *Woomera Test Range, Australia (WOM) *Indian Ocean ship (IOS) *Pacific Ocean ship (USNS Wheeling) The Bermuda FPS-16 radar was the only radar on the entire network that had track during the capsule's insertion into an orbital track, and thus was vital to the verification of proper orbit. The next station to have contact was the Canary Islands. Cooper's flight was delayed for 24 hours due to a malfunction in the Bermuda FPS-16 radar's antenna data system. The radar set failed a CADFISS test, where all the stations in the network had to transmit information to NASA to ensure accurate information could be obtained. The failed part was replaced within 3 hours, but when the Capsule communicator asked for a realistic estimate, he was told 24 hours. The mission was immediately scrubbed for one day. The network expanded for Project Gemini's longer flights which included rendezvous operations involving two spacecraft. A move toward increased computerization and decreased voice support for Gemini made a more centralized network possible with fewer primary stations and more secondary stations, although those major facilities were better equipped. Some Mercury stations were dropped; many were supplemented with new hardware.  The Apollo missions  The Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN) during the Apollo era was also known as the Apollo Network. From a NASA technical report on the history of the MSFN: > The technical facts of life were these: the radars of the Mercury and Gemini > Networks obviously could not track two spacecraft orbiting the Moon a > quarter-million miles away: neither could the small MSFN telemetry antennas > hope to pick out the telemetry and voice messages in the weak signals > arriving from the vicinity of the Moon. Translated into network hardware > terms, Apollo would require at least the following changes in the MSFN: > *A range and range rate tracking system, such as GRARR or the JPL range and > range rate system, would have to be incorporated to accurately track the > distant spacecraft while it was out of radar range. > *Large dish antennas with high gains, such as the 26-m paraboloids employed > in STADAN and the DSN, would have to be added to the MSFN to track and > communicate at lunar distances. > *Extant MSFN stations could not properly monitor the very critical mission > phases when the spacecraft was inserted into its lunar trajectory and when > it plunged into the narrow reentry corridor on the return trip. The result > was that the MSFN had to be extended with ships, aircraft, and additional > land sites. > *Small paraboloidal antennas would have to be added at some MSFN sites to > communicate with the Apollo spacecraft while it was still below the horizon > for the 26-m dishes (below about 16,000 km) but beyond the range of the > Gemini telemetry antennas. > *The communication traffic during the Apollo missions would be several times > that planned for Gemini. NASCOM lines would have to be augmented. To meet these requirements, the MSFN used a combination of resources. A Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) system called \\"Unified S-band\\", or USB, was selected for Apollo communications, which allowed tracking, ranging, telemetry, and voice to all use the same S band transmitter. Near-Earth tracking was provided by upgrading the same networks used for Mercury and Gemini. New large antennas for the lunar phase were constructed explicitly for the MSFN, with Deep Space Network (DSN) large antennas used for backup and critical mission phases. = DSN support during Apollo = Although normally tasked with tracking unmanned spacecraft, the Deep Space Network (DSN) also contributed to the communication and tracking of Apollo missions to the Moon, although primary responsibility remained with the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN). The DSN designed the MSFN stations for lunar communication and provided a second antenna at each MSFN site (the MSFN sites were near the DSN sites for just this reason). Two antennas at each site were needed since the beam widths which the large antennas required were too small to encompass both the lunar orbiter and the lander at the same time. DSN also supplied some larger antennas as needed, in particular for television broadcasts from the Moon, and emergency communications such as Apollo 13. From a NASA report describing how the DSN and MSFN cooperated for Apollo: 100MB PDF file. Explicitly non-copyrighted. > Another critical step in the evolution of the Apollo Network came in 1965 > with the advent of the DSN Wing concept. Originally, the participation of > DSN 26-m antennas during an Apollo Mission was to be limited to a backup > role. This was one reason why the MSFN 26-m sites were collocated with the > DSN sites at Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra. However, the presence of two, > well-separated spacecraft during lunar operations stimulated the rethinking > of the tracking and communication problem. One thought was to add a dual > S-band RF system to each of the three 26-m MSGN antennas, leaving the nearby > DSN 26-m antennas still in a backup role. Calculations showed, though, that > a 26-m antenna pattern centered on the landed Lunar Module would suffer a > 9-to-12 db loss at the lunar horizon, making tracking and data acquisition > of the orbiting Command Service Module difficult, perhaps impossible. It > made sense to use both the MSFN and DSN antennas simultaneously during the > all-important lunar operations. JPL was naturally reluctant to compromise > the objectives of its many unmanned spacecraft by turning three of its DSN > stations over to the MSFN for long periods. How could the goals of both > Apollo and deep space exploration be achieved without building a third 26-m > antenna at each of the three sites or undercutting planetary science > missions? > The solution came in early 1965 at a meeting at NASA Headquarters, when > Eberhardt Rechtin suggested what is now known as the \\"wing concept\\". The > wing approach involves constructing a new section or \\"wing\\" to the main > building at each of the three involved DSN sites.

Permit tracking and two-way data transfer with either > spacecraft during lunar operations. 2\\\\. Permit tracking and two-way data > transfer with the combined spacecraft during the flight to the Moon 3\\\\. > Provide backup for the collocated MSFN site passive track (spacecraft to > ground RF links) of the Apollo spacecraft during trans-lunar and trans-earth > phases. With this arrangement, the DSN station could be quickly switched > from a deep-space mission to Apollo and back again. GSFC personnel would > operate the MSFN equipment completely independently of DSN personnel. Deep > space missions would not be compromised nearly as much as if the entire > station's equipment and personnel were turned over to Apollo for several > weeks. The details of this cooperation and operation are available in a two-volume technical report from JPL.  Current communication with Earth-orbiting spacecraft  , three different NASA networks are used - the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Near Earth Network (NEN) and the Space Network/Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The DSN, as the name implies, tracks probes in deep space (more than from Earth), while NEN and TDRSS are used to communicate with satellites in low earth orbit. TDRSS uses a network of 10 geostationary communication satellites, and a single ground station at White Sands Test Facility. After Apollo, the MSFN no longer needed the large antennas that had been used for lunar communication, which were eventually given over to the DSN. In 1985, the antenna at Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station was moved to the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) DSN site, and the antenna at Fresnedillas was moved to the existing Robledo DSN location. The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex antenna is still in its original location.

Outside AVE service, Talgo markets this train as the Talgo 350. Further production of closely related trains, differing in seating arrangement, resulted in the S-112. Background, design and orders The AVE Class 102 was constructed by Talgo with Adtranz (later Bombardier Transportation) providing the power car technology. It was principally designed for the Madrid-Barcelona line. The trainsets consist of Talgo passenger cars modified in order to allow speeds of up to with power cars at each end. However, its certified maximum operating speed is due to the limits of its eight motors. The trainsets can consist of up to 12 Talgo series VII coaches. Power unit with a 'beak' The train is nicknamed Pato, Spanish for duck, due to the aerodynamic design of the power cars resembling a beak. The beak design reduces noise created by air resistance at top speeds. The series trains were intended for a top speed of . This top speed was supposed to be enough to fulfill the tender condition of a two-and-a-half-hour travel time between Madrid and Barcelona. Experts ascribe this reduction compared to original plans to budgetary reasons, which derive from the strongly increased power requirements at even higher speeds. =RENFE Class 112= RENFE's original order in 2004 was for 16 series units, delivery of which began in 2004.

After the successful completion of the tests, the first eight series units commenced operation on the Madrid-Zaragoza-Lleida line on 26 February 2005. Initially, maximum service speed was restricted to , due to problems with the train control and signalling system on the line. After the commissioning of the train control system ETCS Level 1, the top speed was increased in steps. Since 7 May 2007, the trains travel with the top speed targeted for the time being . After the stabilisation of the train control system ETCS Level 2, the trains may cover the distance of 621 km between Madrid and Barcelona in about 2 hours 30 minutes, with a top speed of .

It was independently discovered by the French economist Gérard Debreu (1960) and by the American mathematical psychologist R. Duncan Luce and statistician John Tukey . The theory concerns the situation where at least two natural attributes, A and X, non-interactively relate to a third attribute, P. It is not required that A, X or P are known to be quantities. Via specific relations between the levels of P, it can be established that P, A and X are continuous quantities. Hence the theory of conjoint measurement can be used to quantify attributes in empirical circumstances where it is not possible to combine the levels of the attributes using a side-by-side operation or concatenation. The quantification of psychological attributes such as attitudes, cognitive abilities and utility is therefore logically plausible. This means that the scientific measurement of psychological attributes is possible. That is, like physical quantities, a magnitude of a psychological quantity may possibly be expressed as the product of a real number and a unit magnitude. Application of the theory of conjoint measurement in psychology, however, has been limited. It has been argued that this is due to the high level of formal mathematics involved (e.g., ) and that the theory cannot account for the \\"noisy\\" data typically discovered in psychological research (e.g., ). It has been argued that the Rasch model is a stochastic variant of the theory of conjoint measurement (e.g., ; ; ; ; ; ), however, this has been disputed (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Kyngdon, 2008). Order restricted methods for conducting probabilistic tests of the cancellation axioms of conjoint measurement have been developed in the past decade (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Davis-Stober, 2009). The theory of conjoint measurement is (different but) related to conjoint analysis, which is a statistical-experiments methodology employed in marketing to estimate the parameters of additive utility functions. Different multi-attribute stimuli are presented to respondents, and different methods are used to measure their preferences about the presented stimuli. The coefficients of the utility function are estimated using alternative regression-based tools. Historical overview In the 1930s, the British Association for the Advancement of Science established the Ferguson Committee to investigate the possibility of psychological attributes being measured scientifically. The British physicist and measurement theorist Norman Robert Campbell was an influential member of the committee. In its Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940), Campbell and the Committee concluded that because psychological attributes were not capable of sustaining concatenation operations, such attributes could not be continuous quantities. Therefore, they could not be measured scientifically. This had important ramifications for psychology, the most significant of these being the creation in 1946 of the operational theory of measurement by Harvard psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens. Stevens' non-scientific theory of measurement is widely held as definitive in psychology and the behavioural sciences generally . Whilst the German mathematician Otto Hölder (1901) anticipated features of the theory of conjoint measurement, it was not until the publication of Luce & Tukey's seminal 1964 paper that the theory received its first complete exposition. Luce & Tukey's presentation was algebraic and is therefore considered more general than Debreu's (1960) topological work, the latter being a special case of the former . In the first article of the inaugural issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology, proved that via the theory of conjoint measurement, attributes not capable of concatenation could be quantified. N.R. Campbell and the Ferguson Committee were thus proven wrong. That a given psychological attribute is a continuous quantity is a logically coherent and empirically testable hypothesis. Appearing in the next issue of the same journal were important papers by Dana Scott (1964), who proposed a hierarchy of cancellation conditions for the indirect testing of the solvability and Archimedean axioms, and David Krantz (1964) who connected the Luce & Tukey work to that of Hölder (1901). Work soon focused on extending the theory of conjoint measurement to involve more than just two attributes. and Amos Tversky (1967) developed what became known as polynomial conjoint measurement, with providing a schema with which to construct conjoint measurement structures of three or more attributes. Later, the theory of conjoint measurement (in its two variable, polynomial and n-component forms) received a thorough and highly technical treatment with the publication of the first volume of Foundations of Measurement, which Krantz, Luce, Tversky and philosopher Patrick Suppes cowrote . Shortly after the publication of Krantz, et al., (1971), work focused upon developing an \\"error theory\\" for the theory of conjoint measurement. Studies were conducted into the number of conjoint arrays that supported only single cancellation and both single and double cancellation (; ). Later enumeration studies focused on polynomial conjoint measurement (; ). These studies found that it is highly unlikely that the axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are satisfied at random, provided that more than three levels of at least one of the component attributes has been identified. Joel Michell (1988) later identified that the \\"no test\\" class of tests of the double cancellation axiom was empty. Any instance of double cancellation is thus either an acceptance or a rejection of the axiom. Michell also wrote at this time a non-technical introduction to the theory of conjoint measurement which also contained a schema for deriving higher order cancellation conditions based upon Scott's (1964) work. Using Michell's schema, Ben Richards (Kyngdon & Richards, 2007) discovered that some instances of the triple cancellation axiom are \\"incoherent\\" as they contradict the single cancellation axiom. Moreover, he identified many instances of the triple cancellation which are trivially true if double cancellation is supported. The axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are not stochastic; and given the ordinal constraints placed on data by the cancellation axioms, order restricted inference methodology must be used . George Karabatsos and his associates (Karabatsos, 2001; ) developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology for psychometric applications. Karabatsos & Ullrich 2002 demonstrated how this framework could be extended to polynomial conjoint structures. Karabatsos (2005) generalised this work with his multinomial Dirichlet framework, which enabled the probabilistic testing of many non-stochastic theories of mathematical psychology. More recently, Clintin Davis-Stober (2009) developed a frequentist framework for order restricted inference that can also be used to test the cancellation axioms. Perhaps the most notable (Kyngdon, 2011) use of the theory of conjoint measurement was in the prospect theory proposed by the Israeli – American psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Prospect theory was a theory of decision making under risk and uncertainty which accounted for choice behaviour such as the Allais Paradox. David Krantz wrote the formal proof to prospect theory using the theory of conjoint measurement. In 2002, Kahneman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for prospect theory (Birnbaum, 2008). Measurement and quantification =The classical / standard definition of measurement= In physics and metrology, the standard definition of measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (de Boer, 1994/95; Emerson, 2008). For example, the statement \\"Peter's hallway is 4 m long\\" expresses a measurement of an hitherto unknown length magnitude (the hallway's length) as the ratio of the unit (the metre in this case) to the length of the hallway. The number 4 is a real number in the strict mathematical sense of this term. For some other quantities, invariant are ratios between attribute differences. Consider temperature, for example. In the familiar everyday instances, temperature is measured using instruments calibrated in either the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. What are really being measured with such instruments are the magnitudes of temperature differences. For example, Anders Celsius defined the unit of the Celsius scale to be 1/100th of the difference in temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level. A midday temperature measurement of 20 degrees Celsius is simply the difference of the midday temperature and the temperature of the freezing water divided by the difference of the Celsius unit and the temperature of the freezing water. Formally expressed, a scientific measurement is: : Q = r \\\\times [Q] where Q is the magnitude of the quantity, r is a real number and [Q] is a unit magnitude of the same kind. =Extensive and intensive quantity= Length is a quantity for which natural concatenation operations exist. That is, we can combine in a side-by-side fashion lengths of rigid steel rods, for example, such that the additive relations between lengths is readily observed. If we have four 1 m lengths of such rods, we can place them end to end to produce a length of 4 m. Quantities capable of concatenation are known as extensive quantities and include mass, time, electrical resistance and plane angle. These are known as base quantities in physics and metrology. Temperature is a quantity for which there is an absence of concatenation operations. We cannot pour a volume of water of temperature 40 °C into another bucket of water at 20 °C and expect to have a volume of water with a temperature of 60 °C. Temperature is therefore an intensive quantity. Psychological attributes, like temperature, are considered to be intensive as no way of concatenating such attributes has been found. But this is not to say that such attributes are not quantifiable. The theory of conjoint measurement provides a theoretical means of doing this. =Theory= Consider two natural attributes A, and X. It is not known that either A or X is a continuous quantity, or that both of them are. Let a, b, and c represent three independent, identifiable levels of A; and let x, y and z represent three independent, identifiable levels of X. A third attribute, P, consists of the nine ordered pairs of levels of A and X. That is, (a, x), (b, y),..., (c, z) (see Figure 1). The quantification of A, X and P depends upon the behaviour of the relation holding upon the levels of P. These relations are presented as axioms in the theory of conjoint measurement. Single cancellation or independence axiom Figure One: Graphical representation of the single cancellation axiom. It can be seen that a > b because (a, x) > (b, x), (a, y) > (b, y) and (a, z) > (b, z). The single cancellation axiom is as follows. The relation upon P satisfies single cancellation if and only if for all a and b in A, and x in X, (a, x) > (b, x) is implied for every w in X such that (a, w) > (b, w). Similarly, for all x and y in X and a in A, (a, x) > (a, y) is implied for every d in A such that (d, x) > (d, y). What this means is that if any two levels, a, b, are ordered, then this order holds irrespective of each and every level of X. The same holds for any two levels, x and y of X with respect to each and every level of A. Single cancellation is so-called because a single common factor of two levels of P cancel out to leave the same ordinal relationship holding on the remaining elements. For example, a cancels out of the inequality (a, x) > (a, y) as it is common to both sides, leaving x > y. Krantz, et al., (1971) originally called this axiom independence, as the ordinal relation between two levels of an attribute is independent of any and all levels of the other attribute. However, given that the term independence causes confusion with statistical concepts of independence, single cancellation is the preferable term. Figure One is a graphical representation of one instance of single cancellation. Satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom is necessary, but not sufficient, for the quantification of attributes A and X. It only demonstrates that the levels of A, X and P are ordered. Informally, single cancellation does not sufficiently constrain the order upon the levels of P to quantify A and X. For example, consider the ordered pairs (a, x), (b, x) and (b, y). If single cancellation holds then (a, x) > (b, x) and (b, x) > (b, y). Hence via transitivity (a, x) > (b, y). The relation between these latter two ordered pairs, informally a left-leaning diagonal, is determined by the satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom, as are all the \\"left leaning diagonal\\" relations upon P. Double cancellation axiom Figure Two: A Luce–Tukey instance of double cancellation, in which the consequent inequality (broken line arrow) does not contradict the direction of both antecedent inequalities (solid line arrows), so supporting the axiom. Single cancellation does not determine the order of the \\"right-leaning diagonal\\" relations upon P. Even though by transitivity and single cancellation it was established that (a, x) > (b, y), the relationship between (a, y) and (b, x) remains undetermined. It could be that either (b, x) > (a, y) or (a, y) > (b, x) and such ambiguity cannot remain unresolved. The double cancellation axiom concerns a class of such relations upon P in which the common terms of two antecedent inequalities cancel out to produce a third inequality. Consider the instance of double cancellation graphically represented by Figure Two. The antecedent inequalities of this particular instance of double cancellation are: : (a, y) > (b, x) and : (b, z)> (c, y). Given that: : (a, y) > (b, x) is true if and only if a + y > b + x; and : (b, z) > (c, y) is true if and only if b + z > c + y , it follows that: : a + y + b + z > b + x + c + y. Cancelling the common terms results in: : (a, z) > (c, x). Hence double cancellation can only obtain when A and X are quantities. Double cancellation is satisfied if and only if the consequent inequality does not contradict the antecedent inequalities. For example, if the consequent inequality above was: : (a, z)< (c, x), or alternatively, : (a, z) = (c, x), then double cancellation would be violated and it could not be concluded that A and X are quantities. Double cancellation concerns the behaviour of the \\"right leaning diagonal\\" relations on P as these are not logically entailed by single cancellation. discovered that when the levels of A and X approach infinity, then the number of right leaning diagonal relations is half of the number of total relations upon P. Hence if A and X are quantities, half of the number of relations upon P are due to ordinal relations upon A and X and half are due to additive relations upon A and X . The number of instances of double cancellation is contingent upon the number of levels identified for both A and X. If there are n levels of A and m of X, then the number of instances of double cancellation is n! × m!. Therefore, if n = m = 3, then 3! × 3! = 6 × 6 = 36 instances in total of double cancellation. However, all but 6 of these instances are trivially true if single cancellation is true, and if any one of these 6 instances is true, then all of them are true. One such instance is that shown in Figure Two. calls this a Luce–Tukey instance of double cancellation. If single cancellation has been tested upon a set of data first and is established, then only the Luce–Tukey instances of double cancellation need to be tested. For n levels of A and m of X, the number of Luce–Tukey double cancellation instances is \\\\tbinom{n}{3}\\\\tbinom{m}{3}. For example, if n = m = 4, then there are 16 such instances. If n = m = 5 then there are 100. The greater the number of levels in both A and X, the less probable it is that the cancellation axioms are satisfied at random (; ) and the more stringent test of quantity the application of conjoint measurement becomes. Solvability and Archimedean axioms Figure Three: An instance of triple cancellation. The single and double cancellation axioms by themselves are not sufficient to establish continuous quantity. Other conditions must also be introduced to ensure continuity. These are the solvability and Archimedean conditions. Solvability means that for any three elements of a, b, x and y, the fourth exists such that the equation a x = b y is solved, hence the name of the condition. Solvability essentially is the requirement that each level P has an element in A and an element in X. Solvability reveals something about the levels of A and X — they are either dense like the real numbers or equally spaced like the integers . The Archimedean condition is as follows. Let I be a set of consecutive integers, either finite or infinite, positive or negative. The levels of A form a standard sequence if and only if there exists x and y in X where x ≠ y and for all integers i and i + 1 in I: : (a_i, x) = (a_{i+1}, y). What this basically means is that if x is greater than y, for example, there are levels of A which can be found which makes two relevant ordered pairs, the levels of P, equal. The Archimedean condition argues that there is no infinitely greatest level of P and so hence there is no greatest level of either A or X. This condition is a definition of continuity given by the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes whom wrote that \\"Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude as, when added to itself, can be made to exceed any assigned magnitude among those which are comparable with one another \\" (On the Sphere and Cylinder, Book I, Assumption 5). Archimedes recognised that for any two magnitudes of a continuous quantity, one being lesser than the other, the lesser could be multiplied by a whole number such that it equalled the greater magnitude. Euclid stated the Archimedean condition as an axiom in Book V of the Elements, in which Euclid presented his theory of continuous quantity and measurement. As they involve infinitistic concepts, the solvability and Archimedean axioms are not amenable to direct testing in any finite empirical situation. But this does not entail that these axioms cannot be empirically tested at all. Scott's (1964) finite set of cancellation conditions can be used to indirectly test these axioms; the extent of such testing being empirically determined. For example, if both A and X possess three levels, the highest order cancellation axiom within Scott's (1964) hierarchy that indirectly tests solvability and Archimedeaness is double cancellation. With four levels it is triple cancellation (Figure 3). If such tests are satisfied, the construction of standard sequences in differences upon A and X are possible. Hence these attributes may be dense as per the real numbers or equally spaced as per the integers . In other words, A and X are continuous quantities. Relation to the scientific definition of measurement Satisfaction of the conditions of conjoint measurement means that measurements of the levels of A and X can be expressed as either ratios between magnitudes or ratios between magnitude differences. It is most commonly interpreted as the latter, given that most behavioural scientists consider that their tests and surveys \\"measure\\" attributes on so-called \\"interval scales\\" . That is, they believe tests do not identify absolute zero levels of psychological attributes. Formally, if P, A and X form an additive conjoint structure, then there exist functions from A and X into the real numbers such that for a and b in A and x and y in X: : (a, x)\\\\succsim(b, y)\\\\iff \\\\varphi_A (a) + \\\\varphi_X (x)\\\\geqslant\\\\varphi_A (b) + \\\\varphi_X (y). If \\\\varphi'_A \\\\, and \\\\varphi'_X \\\\, are two other real valued functions satisfying the above expression, there exist \\\\alpha > 0, \\\\beta_A \\\\, and \\\\beta_X \\\\, real valued constants satisfying: : \\\\varphi'_A = \\\\alpha \\\\varphi_A + \\\\beta_A \\\\text{ and } \\\\varphi'_X = \\\\alpha \\\\varphi_X + \\\\beta_X. \\\\, That is, \\\\varphi'_A, \\\\varphi_A, \\\\varphi'_X \\\\, and \\\\varphi_X \\\\, are measurements of A and X unique up to affine transformation (i.e. each is an interval scale in Stevens’ (1946) parlance). The mathematical proof of this result is given in . This means that the levels of A and X are magnitude differences measured relative to some kind of unit difference. Each level of P is a difference between the levels of A and X. However, it is not clear from the literature as to how a unit could be defined within an additive conjoint context. proposed a scaling method for conjoint structures but he also did not discuss the unit. The theory of conjoint measurement, however, is not restricted to the quantification of differences. If each level of P is a product of a level of A and a level of X, then P is another different quantity whose measurement is expressed as a magnitude of A per unit magnitude of X. For example, A consists of masses and X consists of volumes, then P consists of densities measured as mass per unit of volume. In such cases, it would appear that one level of A and one level of X must be identified as a tentative unit prior to the application of conjoint measurement. If each level of P is the sum of a level of A and a level of X, then P is the same quantity as A andX. For example, A and X are lengths so hence must be P. All three must therefore be expressed in the same unit. In such cases, it would appear that a level of either A or X must be tentatively identified as the unit. Hence it would seem that application of conjoint measurement requires some prior descriptive theory of the relevant natural system. Applications of conjoint measurement Empirical applications of the theory of conjoint measurement have been sparse (; ). Several empirical evaluations of the double cancellation have been conducted. Among these, evaluated the axiom to the psychophysics of binaural loudness. They found the double cancellation axiom was rejected. conducted a similar investigation and replicated Levelt, et al.' (1972) findings. observed that the evaluation of double cancellation involves considerable redundancy that complicates its empirical testing. Therefore, evaluated instead the equivalent Thomsen condition axiom, which avoids this redundancy, and found the property supported in binaural loudness. , summarized the literature to that date, including the observation that the evaluation of the Thomsen Condition also involves an empirical challenge that they find remedied by the conjoint commutativity axiom, which they show to be equivalent to the Thomsen Condition. found conjoint commutativity supported for binaural loudness and brightness. applied the theory to L. L. Thurstone's (1927) theory of paired comparisons, multidimensional scaling and Coombs' (1964) theory of unidimensional unfolding. He found support of the cancellation axioms only with Coombs' (1964) theory. However, the statistical techniques employed by Michell (1990) in testing Thurstone's theory and multidimensional scaling did not take into consideration the ordinal constraints imposed by the cancellation axioms . , Kyngdon (2006), Michell (1994) and tested the cancellation axioms of upon the interstimulus midpoint orders obtained by the use of Coombs' (1964) theory of unidimensional unfolding. Coombs' theory in all three studies was applied to a set of six statements. These authors found that the axioms were satisfied, however, these were applications biased towards a positive result. With six stimuli, the probability of an interstimulus midpoint order satisfying the double cancellation axioms at random is .5874 (Michell, 1994). This is not an unlikely event. Kyngdon & Richards (2007) employed eight statements and found the interstimulus midpoint orders rejected the double cancellation condition. applied conjoint measurement to item response data to a convict parole questionnaire and to intelligence test data gathered from Danish troops. They found considerable violation of the cancellation axioms in the parole questionnaire data, but not in the intelligence test data. Moreover, they recorded the supposed \\"no test\\" instances of double cancellation. Interpreting these correctly as instances in support of double cancellation (Michell, 1988), the results of are better than what they believed. applied conjoint measurement to performance on sequence completion tasks. The columns of their conjoint arrays (X) were defined by the demand placed upon working memory capacity through increasing numbers of working memory place keepers in letter series completion tasks. The rows were defined by levels of motivation (A), which consisted in different amount of times available for completing the test. Their data (P) consisted of completion times and average number of series correct. They found support for the cancellation axioms, however, their study was biased by the small size of the conjoint arrays (3 × 3 is size) and by statistical techniques that did not take into consideration the ordinal restrictions imposed by the cancellation axioms. Kyngdon (2011) used Karabatsos's (2001) order-restricted inference framework to test a conjoint matrix of reading item response proportions (P) where the examinee reading ability comprised the rows of the conjoint array (A) and the difficulty of the reading items formed the columns of the array (X). The levels of reading ability were identified via raw total test score and the levels of reading item difficulty were identified by the Lexile Framework for Reading . Kyngdon found that satisfaction of the cancellation axioms was obtained only through permutation of the matrix in a manner inconsistent with the putative Lexile measures of item difficulty.

There were scarcely any differences between the various build series. Not until 1896 were minor changes made to the heating areas, the weights and the coal and water capacities. The rigid mounting of the driving and carrying wheels and the location of the cylinder just in front of the carrying wheel did not prove a success. The D IX locomotives could haul 170 t on the flat at a speed of 65 km/h, on routes with a 2% incline they could manage 95 tons at 20 km/h. Apart from one engine, which had already been retired by Bavaria, the Reichsbahn took on all the engines. Some were taken out of service even before 1925, the rest had followed by 1932.

Each version contains the title track and a B-side, which may include a booklet, a music video, or another bonus track, respectively within the three versions. The single marks a significant change in the band's overall dress style which no longer resembles their original Visual Kei look. In Japan, the single went straight to #3 on the Oricon daily charts, selling over 3,500 copies on its first day and marking their highest position on a mainstream Japanese music chart to date. On the Oricon weekly charts, it ranked at #6, having sold a total of 15,921 copies during its first week. Development history =RAINBOWS= The title track was conceptualized by bassist Saga during a period in which the band members were creating songs without an overall motif. An early version of \\"Rainbows\\" was chosen out of a total of 17 songs from this period. Saga mentions in an interview with Shoxx Magazine that the song's early sound had strong electronic influences at first, which faded as the band introduced and increased live instrumentation during production. Another characteristic that contributed to a more mechanical sound was a drum loop, but this was eventually replaced with live drum work as well. For the lyrics, vocalist Shou envisioned an image of the band playing in a laser beam-filled disco after listening to the demo tape and created the theme of \\"shouting strongly from the darkness to the light\\" from there. The symbol for this theme was eventually realized as a rainbow. =Strawberry Fuzz, Kochouran= Guitarist Hiroto handled songwriting duties for the following songs on the single, with different approaches to each. \\"Strawberry Fuzz\\" came to life as a song that he wanted to perform live, while \\"Kochouran\\" pushed him to search for female vocals, bringing an R&B; feel to the song. The titles for each song came about as themes pervading their lyrics. Shou explains the title of \\"Strawberry Fuzz\\" as a symbol for the embarrassment that a person experiences when they begin to pursue a dream. He chose the color pink to represent this, which in turn led to the word \\"strawberry.\\" The \\"fuzz\\" of the title refers to hiding this intent from others. For \\"Kochouran,\\" he elaborates that the theme is \\"people’s weaknesses and inferiority complexes about beauty,\\" which came to be represented by flowers and butterflies.

The band appears in mostly bright, casual street clothing, with vocalist Shou even appearing in white Shutter Shades. The video often \\"glitches\\" at various points: pausing when the scene changes, stuttering, rewinding for a few seconds, or speeding up. A making-of documentary aired with a live interview on Yahoo! Japan also shows a common video trick in which the band performs to a slowed-down version of the song, and the footage is later sped up. This results in the band members moving faster while maintaining lip-synching at normal speed.

He was the 6th son of Matsumae Akihiro, the 9th lord of Matsumae. At age 4, he was sent to the family estate in Edo. In an act most unusual for a daimyō's son, his education included the study of the English language. He succeeded to lordship of Matsumae in 1849.

The following year, he and his fellow rōjū Abe Masato were responsible for the opening of the Hyōgo port to foreign trade. However, as they did so against the wishes of the imperial court, the court issued orders calling for their dismissal from office.W.G.

Cicero likened these speeches to those of Demosthenes against Philip II of Macedon;Cicero, Ad Atticus, 2.1.3 both Demosthenes’s and Cicero's speeches became known as Philippics. Cicero's Second Philippic is styled after Demosthenes' De Corona ('On the Crown'). The speeches were delivered in the aftermath of the assassination of Julius Caesar, during a power struggle between Caesar's supporters and his assassins. Although Cicero was not involved in the assassination, he agreed with it and felt that Antony should also have been eliminated. In the Philippics, Cicero attempted to rally the Senate against Antony, whom he denounced as a threat to the Roman Republic. The Philippics convinced the Senate to declare Antony an enemy of the state and send an army against him. However, the commanders were killed in battle, so the Senate's army came under the control of Octavian. When Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the second triumvirate, Antony insisted that they proscribe Cicero in revenge for the Philippics. Cicero was hunted down and killed soon after. Political climate Cicero was taken by surprise when Gaius Julius Caesar, the dictator of the Roman Republic, was assassinated on the fifteenth day of March, 44 BC (known as the Ides of March) by a group of Roman senators who called themselves Liberatores. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. When Marcus Junius Brutus, one of the killers, lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination, he called out Cicero's name, beseeching him to \\"restore the Republic!\\".Cicero, Second Philippic Against Antony A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to Trebonius, one of the conspirators, began, \\"How I wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March!\\"Cicero, Ad Familiares 10.28 Caesar had used his dominant position to simply appoint his supporters to magistracies (which were normally elected positions) and promagistracies (which were usually assigned by the Senate). This was a clear violation of the Roman constitution and left Caesar's supporters, known as the Caesarian faction, vulnerable to their appointments being declared illegal by the Senate. Following the assassination, the Caesarians sought to legitimise their positions and to take revenge on the assassins. With the Caesarians and supporters of the assassins deadlocked in the Senate, Cicero brokered a compromise. He arranged for the Senate to confirm Caesar's appointees in their posts, and in exchange issue an amnesty for the assassins. This brought an uneasy peace between the factions, though it would last less than a year. Cicero became a popular leader during the subsequent months of instability. He was opposed by Mark Antony, one of the consuls for 44 BC and the leader of the Caesarian faction. In private, Cicero expressed his regret that the assassins had not eliminated Antony as well as Caesar. The two men had never been on friendly terms, and their relationship worsened when Antony began acting as the unofficial executor of Caesar's will. Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony was misrepresenting Caesar's wishes and intentions for his own gain. Octavian, Caesar's adopted son and heir, arrived in Italy in April, and visited Cicero at his villa before heading to Rome. Sensing an opportunity, Cicero encouraged Octavian to oppose Antony.Appian, Civil Wars 4.19 In September, Cicero began attacking Antony in a series of speeches, which he called the Philippics, in honour of his inspiration, Demosthenes' speeches denouncing Philip II of Macedon. Cicero lavished praise on Octavian, calling him a \\"god-sent child\\", claiming that the young man desired only honour and would not make the same mistakes as Caesar had. During the period of the Phillippics, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled. He was appointed princeps senatus ('first man of the Senate') in 43 BC, becoming the first plebeian to hold the position. Cicero's attacks rallied the Senate to firmly oppose Antony, whom he called a \\"sheep\\". According to the historian Appian, for a few months Cicero \\"had the [most] power any popular leader could possibly have\\". Speeches The fourteen speeches were: * 1st Philippic (speech in the Senate, 2 September 44): Cicero criticises the legislation of the consuls in office, Mark Antony and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who, he said, had acted counter to the will of the late Caesar (acta Caesaris). He demands that the consuls return to looking after the welfare of the Roman people. * 2nd Philippic (pamphlet, conceived as a senatorial speech, 24 October 44,cf. Ciceros, Ad Atticum 15.13.1 possibly published only after the death of Cicero): Vehement attacks on Mark Antony, including the accusation that he surpasses in his political ambition even Lucius Sergius Catilina and Publius Clodius Pulcher. Catalogue of the \\"atrocities\\" of Mark Antony. It is the longest of Cicero's Philippics. * 3rd Philippic (speech in the Senate, 20 December 44, in the morning): Fearing prosecution once his term as consul ends on 1 January, Antony has left Rome with an army, heading for Cisalpine Gaul. Cicero calls on the Senate to act against Antony, and demands that they show solidarity with Octavian and Decimus Junius Brutus (one of Caesar's assassins who was now serving as the governor of Cisalpine Gaul). * 4th Philippic (speech in the public assembly, 20 December 44, in the afternoon): Cicero denounces Mark Antony as a public enemy and argues that peace with Antony is inconceivable. * 5th Philippic (speech in the Senate, held in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, 1 January 43, in the presence of the new consuls Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus): Cicero urges the Senate not to send an embassy to Mark Antony and warns against Antony's intentions. Cicero proposes that the Senate honour Decimus Junius Brutus, Octavian and his troops, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Cicero's proposals are declined; the Senate sends the three ex-consuls Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Lucius Marcius Philippus and Servius Sulpicius Rufus to Mark Antony. * 6th Philippic (speech in the public assembly, 4 January 43): Cicero describes the embassy carried out by the Senate as merely delaying an inevitable declaration of war against Mark Antony. He believes war will come after the return of the ambassadors. He appeals for unanimity in the fight for freedom. * 7th Philippic (speech in the Senate, outside the agenda, in mid-January 43): Cicero presents himself as an attorney of peace, but considers war against Mark Antony as a demand of the moment. Once more, he demands that negotiations with Mark Antony be discontinued. *8th Philippic (speech in the Senate, 3 February 43): Because Antony has turned down the demands of the Senate, Cicero concludes that the political situation is a de facto war. He would rather use the word bellum (war) than tumultus (unrest) to describe the current situation. He criticises the ex-consul Quintus Fufius Calenus, who wants to negotiate peace with Mark Antony: peace under him would be the same as slavery. He proposes amnesty to all soldiers that will leave Antony before 15 March 43, but those who stay with him later should be considered public enemies. The Senate agrees. *9th Philippic (speech in the Senate, 4 February 43): Cicero demands that the Senate honour Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who died during the embassy to Mark Antony. The Senate agrees to this proposal. *10th Philippic (speech in the Senate, in mid-February 43): Cicero praises the military deeds of Marcus Junius Brutus in Macedonia and Illyricum. He demands that the Senate confirm Brutus as the governor of Macedonia, Illyricum, and Greece together with the troops. The Senate agrees. *11th Philippic (speech in the Senate, end of February 43): Cicero castigates Dolabella for having murdered Gaius Trebonius, the governor of Asia. He demands that the governorship of Syria be given to Gaius Cassius Longinus. The Senate turns down this proposal. *12th Philippic (speech in the Senate, beginning of March 43): Cicero rejects a second embassy to Mark Antony, even though he was at first ready to participate in it. The Senate agrees. *13th Philippic (speech in the Senate, 20 March 43): Cicero attacks Antony for conducting war in North Italy (Antony was besieging Decimus Brutus in Mutina). He comments upon a letter of Antony to \\"Gaius Caesar\\" (Octavian) and Aulus Hirtius. He rejects the invitation to peace by Lepidus, referring to Antony's \\"crimes\\". He demands that the Senate honour Sextus Pompeius. *14th Philippic (speech in the Senate, 21 April 43, after the Senatorial victory over Antony at the Battle of Forum Gallorum): Cicero proposes a thanksgiving festival and praises the victorious commanders and their troops. He demands that Mark Antony be declared a public enemy (hostis). The Senate agrees to the latter proposal. =Analysis= The first two speeches mark the outbreak of the enmity between Mark Antony and Cicero. It is possible that Cicero wanted to invoke the memory of his successful denunciation of the Catiline conspiracy; at any rate, he compares Mark Antony with his own worst political opponents, Catiline and Clodius, in a clever rhetorical manner. In the 3rd and 4th speeches, of 20 December 44, he tried to establish a military alliance with Octavian; the primary objective was the annihilation of Mark Antony and the restoration of the res publica libera – the free republic; to reach this goal, he favoured military means unambiguously. As the Senate decided to send a peace delegation, in the 5, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th speeches, he argued against the idea of an embassy and tried to mobilise the Senate and the Roman People to war. In the 10th and 11th, he supports a military strengthening of the republicans Brutus and Cassius, but he was successful only in the case of the first one. In the 12th, 13th and 14th, he wanted to wipe out any doubt against his own war policy. After the victory over Mark Antony, in the last speech he still warns against a too prompt eagerness for peace. Consequence Cicero’s attacks on Antony were only partially successful and were overtaken by events on the battlefield. The Senate agreed with most (but not all) of Cicero's proposals, including declaring Antony an enemy of the state. Cicero convinced the two consuls for 43 BC, Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Vibius Pansa, to lead the Senate's armies (with an allied force commanded by Octavian) against Antony. However, Pansa was mortally wounded at the Battle of Forum Gallorum, and Hirtius died at the Battle of Mutina a few days later. Both battles had been victories for the Senate army, but the deaths of its commanders left the force leaderless. The senior magistrate on the scene was Decimus Brutus (the propraetor of cisalpine Gaul), who the Senate attempted to appoint in command, but Octavian refused to work with him because he had been one of Julius Caesar's assassins. Most of the troops switched their loyalty to Octavian. With Cicero and the Senate attempting to bypass him and now in command of a large army, Octavian decided to reconcile with Antony. Antony and Octavian allied with each other and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to form the second triumvirate, in opposition to Caesar's assassins. With the triumvirate controlling almost all of the military forces, Cicero and the Senate were left defenceless. Immediately after legislating their alliance into official existence (for a five-year term with consular imperium), the triumvirate began proscribing their enemies and potential rivals. Cicero was proscribed, as was his younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero (formerly one of Caesar's legati), and all of their supporters. They included a tribune named Salvius, who had sided with Antony before switching his support to Cicero. Octavian reportedly argued for two days against Cicero being added to the proscription list, but the triumvirs eventually agreed to each sacrifice one close associate (Cicero being Octavian's).Plutarch, Cicero 46.3-5 Most of the proscribed senators sought to flee to the East, particularly to Macedonia where two more of Caesar's assassins, Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, were attempting to recruit new armies. Cicero was one of the most doggedly hunted of the proscribed, but was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public so many refused to report that they had seen him. He was eventually caught leaving his villa in Formiae in a litter heading for the coast, from where he hoped to embark on a ship to Macedonia.Haskell, H.J.: This was Cicero (1964) p.293 He submitted to a soldier, baring his neck to him, suffering death and beheading. Antony requested that the hands that wrote the Philippics also be removed. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the Roman Forum to discourage any who would oppose the new Triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus. References  Literature  * M.

Franz has earned much acclaim and many rewards for this breakthrough. He also has over 840 patents to his name worldwide. Career Franz has spent his entire career at Monsanto in St. Louis, Missouri. After finishing his Ph.D., Franz was hired by Monsanto as a Resident Chemist in 1955.Lemelson-MIT Program. Inventor of the Week: John Franz He focused on process research, new polymer synthesis, and the development of plasticizers and polymer flame retardants.Strong, Colby. People: Monsanto Scientist John E. Franz Wins 1990 Perkins Medal for Applied Chemistry The Scientist 10 (1990): 28Monsanto Biography of Dr. John Franz Franz received two patents while working in the organic division, one for nitrates in 1960, and one for a fire retardant in 1967. He transferred to the Agricultural Division of Monsanto in 1967, motivated by the department's \\"emphasis on publishing, academic contacts, and the freedom to pursue ideas\\" (Monsanto biography). Because his background was in organic chemistry, Franz familiarized himself with the new field by spending a year studying and learning about plant physiology and biochemistry before beginning research. Franz discovered the herbicide glyphosate, and received five dollars for his first patent from Monsanto. From 1960 to 1988, he received over 840 patents worldwide including approximately fifty in the United States. Over the course of his career, Franz published over forty papers and wrote the book Glyphosate: A Unique Global Herbicide with Michael K. Mao and James A. Sikorski. He was promoted to Senior Scientific Fellow in 1975, then Distinguished Fellow in 1980, and later in his career went back to the organic division to concentrate on environmentally friendly products until he retired in 1991. =Discovery of glyphosate= Researchers at Monsanto had been searching for an herbicide that was effective against annual and perennial weeds for nine years but found little success. They knew of two phosphonic acid compounds that were ineffective against weeds, and the researchers were not able to advance the compounds. Franz took over the research in 1969 and incorrectly hypothesized that the phosphonic acids acted as proherbicides that were metabolized to active compounds rather than herbicides. Franz and his research team screened possible metabolites and synthesized compounds and eventually discovered glyphosate in 1970. Although all of the patents regarding glyphosate list Franz as the sole inventor and the Monsanto Company as the assignee, Franz acknowledged that the discovery was a group effort. In 2007, when he was inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame, Franz said, \\"It's a recognition of the entire team of scientists who worked on and supported the development of Roundup herbicides\\".Monsanto Press Release February 9, 2007 Inventor of Roundup To Be Inducted Into National Inventors Hall of Fame Glyphosate works by absorption through leaves, and then moving rapidly to a plant's roots, rhizomes, and meristems. This invaluable breakthrough immediately spurred Monsanto to design and produce plants genetically immune to glyphosates in order to make it easier for farmers to thoroughly spray down their fields for weeds without killing their own crops. Once glyphosate was invented, it took four years to reach the market. It was first introduced as \\"Roundup\\", and is still best known by that brand. Glyphosate has been called by experts in herbicides \\"virtually ideal\\" due to its broad spectrum and low toxicity compared with other herbicides.Monsanto's John E.

However, the chemical’s use has come under attack in numerous countries, with bans or partial bans enacted, and thousands of lawsuits filed alleging the chemical is carcinogenic. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated in June 2019 “We will come to a point where glyphosate isn’t used anymore.” https://www.wsj.com/articles/austrian-herbicide-ban-adds-to-problems-for- roundup-owner-bayer-11562087770 =Other research= Franz undertook research in many areas during his time at Monsanto. Some of his other chemistry research includes antiauxin chemistry (isothiazoles, isoxazoles, pyrazoles), plant chemistry, cell membrane chemistry (glyceride and phospholipid syntheses, liposomes), plant hormone chemistry (abscissic acid analogs, ethylene generators), and nitride sulfide chemistry. He also performed research pertaining to reaction mechanisms, coenzyme A antimetabolites, biorational design of herbicides, and periselective addition reactions of one- and threedipoles, as well as fundamental organic research. =Honors= Franz has received many awards for his important discovery. In 1977, he was awarded the IR-100 award by Industrial Research magazine. In 1981, he received the first J.F. Queeny Award from Monsanto to honor an invention that was also a commercial success. He was the recipient of the 1987 National Medal of Technology, one of the few agricultural technologies to ever receive the honor. Franz received the American Chemical Society’s Carothers Award in 1989 for \\"outstanding contributions and advances in industrial applications of chemistry\\". In 1990, he was awarded the Perkin Medal by the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry, based on his contributions to the research and development of applied chemistry. Franz also won the Outstanding Achievement Award in 1988, the 1988 Missouri Award, and was named the St. Louis Metropolitan Bar Association Inventor of the Year in 1986. Roundup was named one of the \\"Top 10 Products That Changed the Face of Agriculture\\" by the magazine Farm Chemicals in 1994. Franz was inducted into the United States' Inventor's Hall of Fame on May 5, 2007. Monsanto has also created two awards in his honor. On December 8, 1995, the agricultural company introduced the Franz Sustainability Award, which consists of an annual $100,000 prize given to the individual or team that submits the best environmental project for improvement in the areas of conservation, technology, and/or education.Monsanto Press Release. December 8, 1995 Monsanto Announces John Franz Sustainability Award Soon after Franz's induction into the Inventors' Hall of Fame in 2007, Monsanto announced a new annual scholarship called the Franz Innovation Award Scholarship.

The shared decorative arts tradition of this region is known as the Great Road Style, so called because of the region’s historical importance as a stage route connecting the eastern seaboard with the western frontier. The material culture of this region is evidenced in distinctive forms of furniture, ceramics, textiles, and metalwork. The first substantive effort to conduct primary research of the Great Road Style's decorative artifacts is Great Road Style: The Decorative Arts Legacy of Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee, by Betsy White. The book involved thousands of hours’ worth of fieldwork conducted across Tennessee and Virginia in an attempt to offer the most detailed accounting possible of handmade objects produced along the Great Road before 1940. The eventual product of that exhaustive research was an archive of photographs, slides, and data sheets on more than two thousand objects representing diverse sectors of the survey area. In organizing and providing a narrative for this treasure trove of material, White and her research team have defined and delineated for the first time what constitutes Great Road Style. Cultural Heritage Project The ongoing Cultural Heritage Project at the William King Regional Arts Center seeks to document the cultural and artistic legacy of Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee from 1780 to 1940, and to foster a full and accurate appreciation of the region's role in American decorative and folk arts. To date, field researchers have identified more than 2,000 objects made by hand in the region, and eight exhibitions have been mounted from that research. Reproductions of selected heritage items can be purchased online at the William King Regional Arts Center Looking Glass Museum Store. Documentation and research is ongoing.

Early life Lansing was born on December 12, 1756, in Albany, New York. He was the son of Gerrit Jacobse Lansing (b. 1711) and his second wife Jannetje \\"Jane\\" (née Waters) Lansing (1728–1810). His brother was Chancellor John Lansing, Jr. (1754–1829). Another brother, Sanders G. Lansing (1766–1850) married Catherine Ten Eyck (1769–1850), daughter of Abraham Ten Eyck (1744–1824) and Annatje (née Lansing) Ten Eyck (1746–1823). Through his brother Sanders, he was the uncle of Robert Lansing (1799–1878), a New York State Senator and the grandfather of U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing. His ancestor, Gerrit Frederickse Lansing, came to America in 1640 from Hasselt, Overijssel, the Netherlands. Career During the American Revolutionary War, Lansing served in the Albany militia. In 1776, he was appointed firemaster. Similar to his older brother, his abilities as a clerk made him more useful in an office than on the battlefield. During his service in War, he was involved in the payment of accounts for New York State. Following the War, he was accorded a land bounty right for service in conjunction with his militia regiment. After his marriage to Susanna Yates, he was closely associated with his father-in-law, Abraham Yates Jr., serving in 1780 as his deputy in the Loan Office. =Public office= He was Surrogate of Albany County from 1787 to 1808, and New York State Treasurer from 1803 to 1808, and from 1810 to 1812. Lansing also served on the New York State Board of Regents and was the private secretary to Governor Morgan Lewis. Personal life On April 9, 1779, he married Susanna Yates (1762–1840), the daughter of Abraham Yates (1724–1796), in Albany.

The battalion landed at Utah beach during Operation Neptune, and participated in the conquest of the western front of France and Belgium. Along with survivors of the 333rd Artillery Battalion, it gave fire support to the 101st Airborne Division during the siege of Bastogne. (Battle of the Bulge) The 969th did not suffer the same harrowing casualties as the 333rd but was in the thick of it nonetheless. As a result of the 333rd's high casualty rate, those soldiers fought the rest of the war with the 969th even though on paper the members were still designated as the 333rd. The 969th was equipped primarily with the M1 155 mm howitzer, one of the heaviest artillery pieces in common usage by U.S. forces during World War Two. The gun crews of the 969th were known for singing in cadence as they loaded and fired their guns, and have been praised by many veterans who fought in and around Bastogne, including Donald R. Burgett, for their deadly accuracy and precision.  Battle of Normandy  The 969th landed at Utah Beach on 9 July 1944 under its Commander Lt. Col. Hubert D. Barnes. Its primary mission here was to reinforce the 8th Infantry Division. It took its positions around Lattage du Pont in the vicinity of Le Haye du Puits. After Barnes was injured in battle on 10 July, it operated under its Executive Officer Maj. Einar Erickson. Their role was to support various armored, and infantry divisions, including the 8th Infantry Division, the 90th Infantry Division, and the 4th Armored Division. After fighting around Le Haye du Puits, the 969th moved west towards Rennes, France. The full Battalion moved on 1 August, supporting the 4th Armored Division. The battalion served as suppression and support fire, as Rennes was surrounded by snipers, and was constantly strafed by planes. The Sergeant used a .50 caliber machine gun to suppress sniper fire, and the battalion took credit for 70 prisoners in Rennes. After Rennes, the Battalion, still in support of the 8th Infantry Division, moved even further west, to Brest, France in late August. They remained fighting in Brest until 19 September. The Battalion, again in support of the 8th Infantry Division, moved to Bastogne, Belgium in October 1944, where it attached to the 174th Field Artillery group.  Siege of Bastogne  The 969th, along with three other VIII Corps African American field artillery units, including the 3334 Field Artillery Group, the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion, and the 578th Field Artillery Battalion, moved to support infantry divisions, including the 106th Infantry Division. The Battalions were limited to 250 shots a day because of limited supplies. The Germans staged an attack on 16 December against the position of VIII Corp's 3334 Field Artillery Group in Bleialf. This ambush proved deadly to the 3334 Artillery Groups, and because of need of support in the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion, on 18 December the 969th was assigned to the 333rd by verbal order (Wereth 11 Massacre). After, the Axis again surrounded the VIII Corps and was penetrating American forces quickly. The 969th was among the first groups to receive small arms fire, forcing them to move positions. The 333rd's harrowing losses during this ambush pushed those remaining to support the 969th and 101st Airborne Division. The 333rd, 969th, and other artillery groups were commandeered by the 101st, and formed a temporary artillery group. The newly enlarged 969th continued to support the 101st Airborne Division until 12 January 1945, where it was relieved from the 101st and assigned back to the 3334 Field Artillery Group.  Colmar Pocket  Beginning on 23 January 1945, it continued to support various divisions and groups, including the 1st French Division (DNII) and the 30th Field Artillery Group in Alsace, France during the Colmar Pocket. The 969th had fired 912 rounds on the first day of the attack. On 25 January 1945, the 969th attached to the 5th French Armored Division, and later to the 75th Division and the 2d French Armored Division. The 969th, joined by the African American 999th Artillery Division and the 686th Artillery Division fired support for XII Corp's run along the Saar River and the Rhine. By 28 April 1945, the battalion had fired its last shots of the war. By the end of the war, the 969th Field Artillery Battalion had fought with all four American armies in the European theatre, and with the French in the Colmar Pocket. It had fired a total of 42,489 rounds from its howitzers in support of American and French allied divisions. = Distinguished Unit Citation = Because of its success and gallant support at Bastogne, the 969th received its Distinguished Unit Citation through Third Army on 7 February 1945, from Maj. Gen. Maxwell Taylor, commander of the 101st. This was the first Distinguished Unit Citation awarded to an African American combat unit.

Adrian Wyatt, Quintain founder and chief executive, Independent, 25 May 2012 At Wembley Park 500 homes were built and occupied, and Wembley Arena was renovated and re-opened. A 661-bedroom student scheme and 381-bedroom Hilton Hotel were built. The London Designer Outlet (LDO) opened in autumn 2013. In July 2015, Quintain accepted a £700 million offer from Lone Star Funds. However, the deal had only been approved by 71.7% of the shareholders - short of the 75% required for the deal to go through. Activist hedge fund, Elliot Associates LP, took control of 12.9% of voting rights for Quintain. As a result of the pressure put on by the activist hedge fund, Lone Star Funds increased the buyout offer to £745 million. This represents a bid that is 10 pence higher than the previous. One of the intriguing parts of the buyout lies in Quintain's preapproval to build 5,000 houses surrounding Wembley Stadium - home to England's soccer team. Quintain has approval to build 8,500 new homes near England's national football stadium at Wembley and Lone Star plans to accelerate the construction at the project after its bid is accepted. In 2016, Quintain launched Tipi to manage all 6,000 of the Build to Rent apartments for rent at Wembley Park. In 2020 Tipi was re-branded to Quintain Living.

Chris & Don combines present-day interviews, archival footage shot by the couple from the 1950s, excerpts from Isherwood's diaries, and playful animations to recount their romance. It was directed by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara, and was the centerpiece film at NewFest, the New York LGBTQ Film Festival, in 2008.  Plot  Chris & Don tells the story of a romance that began on the beaches of Santa Monica in the 1950s, when Christopher Isherwood at age 48 met Don Bachardy who then was eighteen years old. Isherwood, an established author with works such as The Berlin Stories, which helped inspire much of Cabaret, helped Bachardy discover and develop his affinity for drawing and painting as he became a renowned portrait painter during the second half of the 20th century to the present. The documentary includes insight from friends, including Liza Minnelli and John Boorman, who tell of the countless struggles the two faced as one of the first openly gay couples in Hollywood. Despite the age difference, the couple endured until Isherwood succumbed to prostate cancer in 1986. Critical reception The film received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported a score of 81 out of 100, based on 19 reviews from major newspapers and magazines. Many critics also drew parallels between the California Supreme Court ruling affirming same-sex marriage and the release of the film.

It is Alcott's sequel to Eight Cousins. Characters *Rose Campbell: The heroine of the story. She is sweet, kind, pretty, and ambitious. She is an heiress just come of age, and struggles with the many suitors she attracts by learning to judge love versus those who regard her only as \\"a good match.\\" *Archibald \\"Archie\\" Campbell: Eldest son of Jem and Jessie. Eldest of all the cousins, of steady and thoughtful character, he is the Chief, much respected by all the boys and an “older brother” figure to Rose. He works for Uncle Mac and has begun to \\"settle down\\", some think too young. *Charles C. Campbell (Charlie): Also known as Prince Charlie, the “flower of the family,” considered the most handsome, talented, and promising of the lot. He is the spoiled only child of Stephen and Clara – spoiled by his too-indulgent mother, with no father present to give him guidance. Charlie is looked up to by all the boys because he is particularly charming and well loved in society, nicknamed \\"Prince Charming\\" by the girls. He falls in love with, and tries to woo, Rose. *Alexander Mackenzie Campbell (Mac): The elder son of Mac and Jane. Known as the Bookworm, or simply “the Worm,” Mac always has his nose in a book and is regarded as the wisest and most learned of the cousins, even though through absent-mindedness and lack of interest he is deficient in basic social skills. In Rose in Bloom, Rose tries to help Mac overcome his awkward social skills by inviting him to accompany her to a dance, and he generally allows her to \\"polish\\" him into a well-rounded gentleman. He later falls in love with Rose. *Stephen Campbell (Steve): Younger brother of Mac. A good-natured, though rather conceited dandy, he idolizes Charlie and copies him in everything, not always to his own advantage. However, his intentions are sound, and he proves to have greater self-control and willpower than Charlie ever displays. He gets engaged to Kitty Van Tassel. *William and George Campbell (Will and Geordie): Second and third sons of Jem and Jessie. They are in cadet school now, and very proud of their uniforms, though perhaps a bit awkward by sudden growth spurts. They are just now becoming old enough to travel in society, no longer being children. *James Campbell (Jamie): Youngest son of Jem and Jessie; the much-loved but only slightly spoiled baby of the family. He is known for inappropriately bursting out information he overheard the aunts saying in confidence. He is also a favorite of Rose's, being the only child left of the boys. *Phebe Moore: A sweet maid who Rose befriended in Eight Cousins. Between the events of Eight Cousins and Rose in Bloom, she travels with Rose to Europe and upon arriving in the US at the beginning of the novel, begins a career as a singer. She is accomplished and beautiful, and instantly attracts the attention of several of the boys, but wins Archie's heart without effort or design. *Uncle Alec: Rose's guardian after her father died. He holds a different view to bringing up a girl than the culture at that time, believing that too many balls, attention and admirers ruin a girl, and that wholesome food, regular exercise, a well-rounded education and keeping a pure mind are preferable to the fads of the time. He brings Rose up differently to most girls in her social set, allowing her to study and play and get plenty of exercise. He is naturally the example Rose holds all other young men to. He is Rose's confidant and advisor in almost all things, and proves his worth throughout the book. *Uncle Mac: Younger Mac's father. A successful importer, and kindred spirit with Rose and Alec. At the beginning of the book, he and Alec begin speculative match-making for Rose's hand with much humor. *Aunt Plenty: The spinster aunt of Uncle Alec with whom Rose and Uncle Alec live. In this sequel, she is dealing with more physical issues due to old age, and has some issues with pride when Archie wishes to marry someone Aunt Plenty deems of a lower class. She is also dealing with the loss of her sister, Aunt Peace. In the end she comes around to everyone's satisfaction and is a model example of a loving family matriarch. *Aunt Myra: One of the Campbell Aunts who always believes she and everyone else is sick. She drives the family to distraction, and some humor, with imagined diseases. Her only daughter died young, and she is a widow. *Aunt Clara: Charlie's mother. She loves society, is a great follower of fashion, and is much involved in bringing Rose out. While she loves her son Charlie, she has over-indulged him to the point that he lacks self-will and strength of character, a fact that is noticed and mourned by the rest of the family. She also schemes to have Rose marry Charlie. *Aunt Jessie: The mother of Archie, Will, Geordie and Jamie. She is the \\"little mum\\" whom all the cousins love. She is like a mother to Rose and would love to have Rose for a daughter-in-law, but despite some disappointment, genuinely tries to welcome Phebe when Archie's love for her first comes to light. Aunt Jessie is the most like Uncle Alec in his modern outlook than any of the other women in the novel. *Aunt Jane: The mother of Mac and Steve; she is very severe and believes in discipline, but has a good heart. Rose comes to have great respect and affection for her despite her somewhat offputting nature. *Kitty Van Tassel: A rich young woman who moves in the same social circles as the Campbells. Steve proposes and they get engaged. She is rather silly, but Steve's and Rose's good influence improve her mind a good deal and she tries to be better.  Plot  The story begins when Rose returns home from a long trip to Europe. Everyone has changed. As a joke, Rose lines up her seven cousins to take a long look at them, just as they did with her when they first met. The youngest, Jamie, accidentally mentions that the aunts want Rose to marry one of her cousins to keep her fortune in the family. Rose is very indignant, for she has decided ideas about what her future holds. From the beginning, she declares that she can manage her property well on her own and that she will focus on philanthropic work. Charlie has already decided she is marked out for him, with the approval of his mother. Phebe also comes home no longer the servant that Rose \\"adopted\\" but as a young lady with a cultured singing ability. Rose challenges anyone who would look down on \\"her Phebe\\", and she is readily accepted as part of the Campbell clan until Archie falls in love with her: the family feel that Archie would be marrying beneath himself. Phebe's pride and debt to the family make her wish to prove herself before she will accept Archie; so she leaves the Campbells' home and sets off to make a name for herself as a singer, to try to earn the respect of her adopted family. After some time at home, Rose has her \\"coming out\\" into society, much to her Uncle Alec's chagrin. She promises to try high society for only three months. During that time, her cousin Charlie falls in love with her and tries in various ways to woo her. Rose begins to give in to his charm, but he derails the budding romance by coming to her house, late one night, very drunk. This ruins all her respect for him and she sees how unprincipled he really is. After the three months are up, Rose begins to focus on her philanthropic projects and convinces Charlie to try to refrain from alcohol and other frivolous things, in order to win her love and respect. She tries to help Charlie overcome his bad habits with the help of her uncle, but fails. Charlie does all he can to win her heart, but in the end he succumbs, hindered by his own weak will and his constant need for acceptance by his friends. Being spoilt by his mother meant he never learned to say \\"no\\", even to himself, and his lack of discipline proves fatal: Charlie's life ends tragically in an alcohol-induced accident on the eve of his voyage to see his father and restore his good character. Although Rose never was in love with Charlie, she did have hope that he would return a better man and that they might see what relationship could develop. Several months after Charlie's death, Rose finds out that another cousin, Mac, is now in love with her. At first, never thought of him as anything but \\"the worm\\", she refuses his love; but she does declare the deepest respect for him. This gives Mac hope, and he goes to medical school, willing to work and wait for her. She finds his devotion touching, and she begins to see him clearly for the first time, realizing that Mac is the \\"hero\\" she has been looking for. He is exactly suited to her tastes and has become a man in the noblest sense of the word. He also settles a joke with her by publishing a small book of poetry to wide critical success, earning her respect even more deeply. It is his absence that shows her how much she cares for him. While Rose is discovering her heart, Steve and a minor character, Kitty, engage to marry. This creates a new sensation in the family, and Kitty begins to look to Rose for sisterly guidance. Rose encourages her to improve her silly mind, and Kitty is a very willing pupil. Rose continues to wait for Mac's return but reaches a crisis when Uncle Alec becomes very sick while visiting Mac; Phebe nurses him back from the brink of death, at personal peril, and returns him to the anxious Campbells to be greeted as a triumphant member of the family, sealing her own engagement with Archie with everyone's blessing. This homecoming is completed for Rose when she is reunited with Mac and finally declares her own sentiments. The book closes with three very happy couples, and much hope for their felicity.

It carries four lanes of Autoroute 20, and was named after Antonin Galipeault, who was minister of public works under Louis- Alexandre Taschereau. Incidentally, Taschereau Bridge, along the same highway, was part of the same project. The first span was built in 1924, a girder bridge that was replaced in 1991 by another structure of the same type, using the same foundations. It was doubled in 1964 with a cable-stayed bridge, which carried the eastbound lanes of Autoroute 20 until its demolition early in 2008. Galipeault Bridge between Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue and l'île Perrot. July 20, 1948. The 1964 doubling of the structure was done to appease business interests in L'Île-Perrot and Dorion who were worried that the abandoning of the unfinished Île Bray Bridge in favor of the nearby Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which avoids Perrot Island completely, might hurt their activities. The original plan for a freeway out of Montreal to the west called for upgrading the highway between Galipeault and Taschereau bridges to freeway standards, the doubling of Taschereau, and the construction of a new bridge in the vicinity of Galipeault, which would have connected with Autoroute 40 on the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue side. The bridge in question, Île Bray Bridge, which was never finished, was already under construction when the transportation ministry changed its plans in favor of a long span across Lake of Two Mountains. The 1991 span carried the westbound lanes until the demolition of the eastbound structure forced its use as a two-way span. The eastbound span's construction was finished in early October and opened November 28, 2009. Like Taschereau, Galipeault was built next to a Grand Trunk Railroad bridge that was part of the first fixed link from Montreal to the outside world. The bridge is used by 54,000 vehicles every day, or 19.7 million a year, making it among the busiest bridges in Montreal.

It is north-north-east of Charing Cross. https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?vr=apes&fromplace;=Charing%20Cross,%20London,%20England,%20UK&toplace;=Tottenham,%20London,%20England,%20UK History =Toponymy= Tottenham is believed to have been named after Tota, a farmer, whose hamlet was mentioned in the Domesday Book. 'Tota's hamlet', it is thought, developed into 'Tottenham'. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as Toteham. It is not related to Tottenham Court Road in Central London, though the two names share a similar-sounding root. =Early history= Dorset Map of Tottenham, 1619 There has been a settlement at Tottenham for over a thousand years. It grew up along the old Roman road, Ermine Street (some of which is part of the present A10 road), and between High Cross and Tottenham Hale, the present Monument Way. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, about 70 families lived within the area of the manor, mostly labourers working for the Lord of the Manor. A humorous poem entitled the Tournament of Tottenham, written around 1400, describes a mock- battle between peasants vying for the reeve's daughter. In 1894, Tottenham was made an urban district and on 27 September 1934 it became a municipal borough. As from 1 April 1965, the municipal borough formed part of the London Borough of Haringey together with Hornsey and Wood Green. The River Lea (or Lee) was the eastern boundary between the Municipal Boroughs of Tottenham and Walthamstow. It is the ancient boundary between Middlesex and Essex and also formed the western boundary of the Viking controlled Danelaw. Today it is the boundary between the London Boroughs of Haringey and Waltham Forest. A major tributary of the Lea, the River Moselle, also crosses the borough from west to east, and often caused serious flooding until it was mostly covered in the 19th century. From the Tudor period onwards, Tottenham became a popular recreation and leisure destination for wealthy Londoners. Henry VIII is known to have visited Bruce Castle and also hunted in Tottenham Wood. A rural Tottenham also featured in Izaak Walton's book The Compleat Angler, published in 1653. The area became noted for its large Quaker population and its schools (including Rowland Hill at Bruce Castle.) Tottenham remained a semi-rural and upper middle class area until the 1870s. =Modern era= In late 1870s, the Great Eastern Railway introduced special workman's trains and fares on its newly opened Enfield and Walthamstow branch lines. Tottenham's low-lying fields and market gardens were then rapidly transformed into cheap housing for the lower middle and working classes, who were able to commute cheaply to inner London. The workman's fare policy stimulated the relatively early development of the area into a London suburb. An incident occurred on 23 January 1909, which was at the time known as the Tottenham Outrage.The Tottenham Outrage. Retrieved 2 February 2008. Two armed robbers, Latvian Jews of Russian extraction, held up the wages clerk of rubber works in Chesnut Road. They made their getaway via Tottenham Marshes and fled across the Lea. On the opposite bank of the river, they hijacked a Walthamstow Corporation tramcar, hotly pursued by the police on another tram. The hijacked tram was stopped but the robbers continued their flight on foot. After firing their weapons and killing two people, Ralph Joscelyne, aged 10, and PC William Tyler, they were eventually cornered by the police and shot themselves rather than be captured. Fourteen other people were wounded during the chase. The incident later became the subject of a silent film.Tottenham outrage- silent film . Retrieved 10 November 2008. During the Second World War Tottenham was one of the many targets of the German air offensive against Britain. Bombs fell in the borough (Elmar Road) during the first air raid on London on 24 August 1940. The borough also received V-1 (four incidents) and V-2 hits, the last of which occurred on 15 March 1945. Wartime shortages led to the creation of Tottenham Pudding, a mixture of household waste food which was converted into feeding stuff for pigs and poultry. The \\"pudding\\" was named by Queen Mary on a visit to Tottenham Refuse Works. Production continued into the post-war period, its demise coinciding with the merging of the borough into the new London Borough of Haringey. Broadwater Farm, the scene of rioting in 1985 Riots *The Broadwater Farm riot occurred around the Broadwater Farm Estate on 6 October 1985 following the death of Cynthia Jarrett. Jarrett was a resident of Tottenham who lived about a mile from the estate, who died of heart failure during a police search of her home. The tension between local black youths and the largely white Metropolitan Police had been high due to a combination of local issues and the aftermath of riots in Brixton which had occurred in the previous week. The response of some of the black community in Tottenham and surrounding areas culminated in a riot beginning on Tottenham High Road and ending in Broadwater Farm Estate. One police officer, Keith Blakelock, was murdered; 58 policemen and 24 other people were injured in the fighting. Two of the policemen were injured by gunshots during the riot, the first time that firearms had been used in that type of confrontation.Newman, K. [ Police-Public Relations: The Pace of Change: Police Foundation Lecture 1986, The Police Foundation, 1986 The former Bruce Grove Post Office was destroyed during the 2011 Tottenham riots *The 2011 Tottenham riots were a series of riots precipitated by the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year- old man in Tottenham, by officers of the Metropolitan Police Service on 4 August 2011. Attacks were carried out on two police cars, a bus, a Post Office and several local shops from8:00 pm onwards on 6 August 2011. Riot police vans attended the scene of disturbances on Tottenham High Road. Later in the evening,g the riot spread, with an Aldi supermarket and a branch of Allied Carpets also destroyed by fire, and widespread looting in nearby Wood Green shopping centre and the retail park at Tottenham Hale. Several flats above shops on Tottenham High Road collapsed due to the fires. 26 shared ownership flats in the Union Point development above the Carpetright store – built in the landmark Cooperative department store building – were also destroyed by fire. The triggering event was when a group of over one hundred local Tottenham residents set out to undertake a protest march against the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot by police officers assigned to Operation Trident earlier in the week. The crowd made up of Duggan’s family and local community leaders, gathered outside Tottenham police station on 6 August 2011 to protest the failure of the police to provide family members with a formal notice of the killing. The circumstances surrounding Duggan's death were not entirely clear at the time of the riot. On 17 August 2011, the Prince of Wales and his wife Duchess of Cornwall visited an emergency centre to meet victims of the riots.News report Retrieved 22 August 2011 =Railway history= South Tottenham railway station (November 2005) *The Northern and Eastern Railway – running from Stratford to Broxbourne – was opened on 15 September 1840 with two stations in the district: Tottenham and Marsh Lane. *The Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway was opened on 21 July 1868.

Governance =Parliament= Tottenham is the biggest part of the parliamentary constituency of Tottenham. The constituency was created in 1885 when the first MP was Joseph Howard of the Conservative Party. The boundaries were redrawn in 1918, and Tottenham was divided into two separate constituencies: Tottenham North and Tottenham South. Since being reinstated in 1950, it has been predominantly represented by MPs from the Labour Party, with the exception of Alan Brown who defected to the Conservatives due to disagreement with the Labour Party's defence policy at the time. The current MP is David Lammy who won a by-election in 2000 following the death of Bernie Grant. =Local government= Tottenham was at the centre of a local administrative area from the medieval period until 1965. The administrative area developed from a parish in Middlesex into an Urban sanitary district in 1875, after a local board of health had been established in 1850. It was then divided in 1888 and Wood Green became a separate authority. In 1894, Tottenham was reconstituted first as an urban district then as a municipal borough in 1934. See Municipal Borough of Tottenham article. Under the Local Government Act 1963, it became part of the larger London Borough of Haringey. The Tottenham neighbourhood is now one of twenty neighbourhoods in Haringey. Geography =Sub-districts= Because of Tottenham's long history as borough, the Tottenham name is used by some to this day to describe the whole of the area formerly covered by the old borough, incorporating the N17 postcode area and part of N15. However, there are differing views as to what constitutes the Tottenham neighbourhood in the present day. Many think of Tottenham today as most of the area covered by the N17 post code, sometimes using the phrase 'Tottenham Proper' to describe it and to distinguish it from the other parts of the old borough. * North: This area stretches along Tottenham High Road from the Edmonton border in the north to Lordship Lane in the south: districts include Little Russia and Northumberland Park. * Central: Continuing along the high road, the central area includes Bruce Grove, Tottenham Green and Tottenham Hale wards, as well as Tottenham Hale station and retail park. * West: To the west of the area are Broadwater Farm and the Tower Gardens Estate. * South: Further along the A10 road until St Ann's Road, including South Tottenham and Seven Sisters. =Neighbouring areas= * Edmonton * Harringay * Noel Park * Palmers Green * St Ann's * Tottenham Hale * Walthamstow * West Green * Wood Green Demography A claim made by MP David Lammy in 2011, indicated that at that time Tottenham had the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom, and it had some of the highest poverty rates within the country. =Ethnic composition= Tottenham has a multicultural population, with many ethnic groups inhabiting the area. It contains one of the largest and most significant populations of Afro-Caribbean people. These were among the earliest groups of immigrants to settle in the area, starting from the UK's Windrush era. Soon afterwards, West African communities – notably the many Ghanaians – began to move into the area. Between 1980 and the present day, there has been a slow immigration of Colombian, Congolese, Albanian, Kurdish, Turkish and Greek-Cypriot, Turkish, Greek, Somali, Irish, Portuguese, Polish, Vietnamese, Filipino and Zimbabwean populations. The Seven Sisters ward has the largest proportion of Jewish residents among Haringey wards, at 18.1%.https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/ward_profile_seven_sisters.pdf There have been major tensions between the African-Caribbean community and the police since (and before) the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot. In the 2011 UK Census, the ethnic composition of the Tottenham constituency, of which Tottenham is a large part, was as follows: *27.7% Other White *26.7% Black *22.3% White British *10.7% Asian *12.6% Other/Mixed Crime Tottenham has been one of the main hotspots for gangs and gun crime in the United Kingdom during the past three decades. This followed the rise of gangs and drug wars throughout the area, notably those involving the Tottenham Mandem gang and various gangs from Hackney and all of the areas surrounding Tottenham, and the emergence of an organised crime ring known as the Turkish mafia was said to have controlled more than 90% of the UK's heroin market. In 1999, Tottenham was identified as one of the yardies' strongholds in London, along with Hackney, Harlesden, Peckham and Brixton. Landmarks Bruce Castle, the old Tottenham manor house, now a museum (November 2005) *All Hallows Church – This is the oldest surviving building in Haringey and dates back to Norman times. For more than 700 years it was the original parish church for Tottenham. Presented in 1802 with a bell from the Quebec Garrison, which was captured from the French in the 1759 Battle of Quebec, Canada. Adjacent to the church is Tottenham Cemetery. *Broadwater Farm – Housing estate completed 1967. Site of the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985. *Brook Street Chapel – Non-denominational Christian chapel, established in 1839, and one of the earliest Plymouth Brethren /Open Brethren assemblies in London that still exists. The church was associated with local notable Christians such as Hudson Taylor, Dr Barnardo, John Eliot Howard, Luke Howard and Philip Gosse. *Bruce Castle, Lordship Lane – Grade 1 listed, it was Tottenham's manor house and dates from the sixteenth century, with alterations by subsequent occupants. It was given the name 'Bruce Castle' during the seventeenth century by the 2nd Lord Coleraine, who was Lord of the Manor at the time. He named it after 'Robert the Bruce', whose family had been lords of the manor during the medieval period. The building was purchased by the Hill family, who turned it into a progressive school. Sir Rowland Hill was its first headmaster, and he was living there in 1840 when he, as Postmaster General, introduced the Uniform Penny Post. Now a local history museum, Bruce Castle holds the archives of the London Borough of Haringey. * 7 Bruce Grove – The building features an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Luke Howard (1772–1864), the 'Father of Meteorology', who named the clouds in 1802. Centre-piece of Northumberland Row (May 2013) * Clyde Circus conservation area. * Downhills Park. * Edmanson's Close – Previously known as the Almshouses of the Drapers' Company, they were built in 1870 and were established through the generosity of three seventeenth-century benefactors, Sir John Jolles, John Pemel and John Edmanson. The towers of the Broadwater Farm Estate dominate the western part of Tottenham *High Cross – Erected sometime between 1600 and 1609 on the site of an earlier Christian cross, although there is some speculation that the first structure on the site was a Roman beacon or marker, situated on a low summit on Ermine Street. Tottenham High Cross is often mistakenly thought to be an Eleanor cross. * Lordship Recreation Ground. * Markfield Beam Engine. * Northumberland Development Project, incorporating a new stadium for Tottenham Hotspur. * Northumberland Row – Erected circa 1740 on the site of the former Smithson seat, previously that of the Hynningham family. The gate piers are possibly from Bruce Castle. The wrought iron gate bears the monogram HS for one of the two Hugh Smithsons, both Tottenham landowners and sometime MPs for Middlesex. *Tottenham Cemetery – A large cemetery, which makes up part of an open access area of land and habitat, along with Bruce Castle Park and All Hallows Churchyard. *Tottenham Marshes (part of the Lee Valley Regional Park). *Tottenham War Services Institute. *Tower Gardens Estate – Previously known as the LCC White Hart Lane Estate, this \\"out of county\\" LCC cottage housing estate was constructed beginning in 1904. The architectural style is said to be inspired by houses in Ghent, Belgium. The estate was the home of Harry Champion, a well-known music hall star and performer of the song \\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\\". *Tottenham Town Hall – A Grade II listed Edwardian building. Transport = London Underground = The Victoria line passes through Tottenham, calling at Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale. This connects Tottenham directly to Walthamstow, the West End and Brixton.

Sport White Hart Lane prior to its demolition in 2017 West entrance of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tottenham High Road Tottenham is the home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur. From 1899 until 2017, the club's home ground was White Hart Lane. In 2017, White Hart Lane ground closed and demolition commenced to make way for a new stadium on the same site, known as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as part of a wider project for the redevelopment of the area. The new stadium was due to open in September 2018, but was delayed until later in the 2018-19 season. The stadium was opened on 3 April 2019. For the 2017-18 season and most of the 2018-19 season, the club played their home games at Wembley. Tottenham also has two non-League football clubs, Haringey Borough F.C. who currently play at Coles Park Stadium and Park View who play at the White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre.

He was one of the most distinguished sociologists and eugenicists of China. Educated at Tsinghua University on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, Dartmouth College and Columbia University, where he was trained by Charles B. Davenport, Pan was also a renowned expert on education. His wide research scope included eugenics, education policy, matrimony policy, familial problems, prostitute policy, and intellectual distributions. Pan's wide-ranging intellect led to his active participation in the Crescent Moon Society.\\"P'an Kuang-tan,\\" , pp. 61-63. Pan's most famous student/was Fei Xiaotong, the \\"father of Chinese anthropology.\\" Career Pan joined the China Democratic Groups League (later China Democratic League) in 1941, and was a standing committee member of the central committee of the League. During the Anti-Rightist Movement, he was determined to be a \\"rightist.\\" Pan was persecuted in Cultural Revolution, and died in 1967, at 69. He was rehabilitated in 1979. Eugenics For Pan, eugenics was both a political and scientific matter, as well as economic, ethnological and sociological; and he is credited with the popularization of eugenic thought in the 1920s and '30s in China. Some of his most influential works include The Eugenic Question in China () and Chinese Family Problems ()(1928). In these works, Pan promoted the family structure over individualism, which he believed, along with traditional marriage, to be most effective in racial improvement through biological inheritance. Urban living, he said, only promoted decadent individualism and contributed nothing to the racial fitness of the nation. Although he supported the use of state power for the implementation of eugenic policies, primarily through his founding of The Chinese Eugenics Institute, conflicts such as the Sino-Japanese War, World War II, and the civil war between the KMT and the Communists prevented governmental adoption of his ideas.Dikotter, Frank. The Discourse of Race in Modern China. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1992. pp. 174–185. In a 1937 volume of essays, Minzu texing yu minzu weisheng ( Racial characteristics and racial hygiene) Pan argued that government programs of health and reconstruction were of no use if the majority of the people were of low quality. He included his translations from the works of Ellsworth Huntington and the American missionary Arthur H. Smith's 1894 book Chinese Characteristics. Smith's chapters \\"Absence of Nerves\\", \\"Disregard of Accuracy\\", and \\"Absence of Public Spirit\\", he said, illustrated the selfish, unscientific, face-loving, \\"Chinese Everyman\\" who weakened the Chinese race. He called for educated and intelligent Chinese to increase their rate of birth and improve Chinese people's health by increasing the number of people who were genetically superior.Ruth Rogaski, Hygienic Modernity: Meanings of Health and Disease in Treaty-Port China (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004): pp.241-242 Pan argued that the anthropological category of “race” was not yet scientifically substantiated. Eugenics as a newly established discipline should not, he believed, become entangled with dubious claims about superior races, since every “color” of people shared both the good and the bad germplasm distributed in its own population.

The trains were constructed by Siemens, as the second member of the company's Velaro family. History On 24 March 2001, Siemens won one half of RENFE's tender to supply 32 high- speed trains for the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line, offering a modified version of the ICE 3 high-speed train used by German Railways (Deutsche Bahn) for its InterCityExpress service. Changes involved an up-rate to higher power () for higher acceleration and top speed to cover the between Barcelona and Madrid in 2h30m, the ability to operate in a high range of temperatures, and a different interior. The ICE 3 trains were a joint production with other Germany-based train manufacturers, who refused to supply parts or sell licenses to Siemens for the AVE Class 103. This caused a delay (for which Siemens eventually paid €21 million), during which Siemens had to re-develop the missing components. However, at the end of this development, Siemens had a complete high-speed train platform, which it named Velaro. The AVE Class 103 was intended as only the second member of a whole family after ICE 3, therefore, it was named by Siemens as the Velaro E. The AVE Class 103 has been certified to run at . During testing between Madrid and Zaragoza, on 16 July 2006, train 005 reached . This is both the current national rail speed record for Spain, and also the current speed record for a normal series train in standard configuration. On 23 December 2005, RENFE ordered a further 10 identical trains (Siemens designation Velaro E2). Currently, all 26 trains from both orders have been delivered and are in service. Specifications The certified top speed of the AVE Class 103 is , currently the highest for any train in the world, although the Alstom AGV, currently conducting extensive tests, aims for certification at . The class has distributed traction, traction equipment was moved underfloor, with powered bogies distributed in alternate carriages along the length of the train. This removes the need for driving units at either end, which AVE Class 100 and 102 have, allowing a better use of space, better energy efficiency, better acceleration at lower speeds, and better ability to climb grades. For the AVE Class 103, four of the eight cars were fitted with two powered bogies each. Electronically, the train is actually two identical half-trains of four coaches each, each with an independent power system, apart from the active pantograph (only a single pantograph is raised on AC-fed rail lines) and a high voltage line along the entire length of the 8-car train. The train's capacity of 404 passengers is split between three classes; with two coupled 8-car trains total capacity is therefore 808 passengers. In the end coaches (driving trailers), glass screens separate the driver and passengers, and allow passengers the same views as the driver, just as in the ICE 3 and other Velaros. The driver can turn these opaque if necessary or preferred. In service The AVE Class 103 entered commercial service on 22 June 2007, between Madrid and the temporary end of the line to Barcelona near Tarragona. While the trains and the tracks were commissioned for a regular top speed of , the train control and signalling system necessary for such operation, ETCS Level 2, was not ready for service. Thus commercial top speed is limited to the maximum Spanish authorities approve for the line with ETCS Level 1 since 2011, . ERTMS is technically capable of supporting speeds of up to 500 km/h, but the signal spacing on the Madrid-Barcelona line was initially, from 7 May 2007, only sufficient to support speeds of 300 km/h. In October 2011 the speed was raised to 310 km/h on parts of the railway.Madrid - Barcelona at 310 km/h with ETCS Level 2 From the opening of the Córdoba–Málaga high-speed rail line on 24 December 2007, the AVE Class 103 were also used from Madrid to Málaga. On 20 February 2008, the final section of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line into Barcelona was opened. From that day, the AVE Class 103 were used for the faster services between Madrid and Barcelona, achieving the shortest travel time of 2h30m on the non-stop runs.

Although it was released in 1990 (1991 in Europe), all of the monsters are from the Showa generation. The game is a port of an edition from the MSX console. Also the international version is slightly different from the Japanese version (different in-game character designs and behavior of the enemy characters). Plot Various monsters that Godzilla had previously defeated, have kidnapped his son, Minilla, and hidden him somewhere inside the Labyrinth of Matrix. It is up to Godzilla to fight the monsters' attacks and solve their many puzzles, all while navigating a much larger maze. Gameplay The game is a 2D side- scrolling video game where Godzilla can only walk around or climb ladders, vines or crystals. A prominent part of the game is his punch, the only attack he has, which is used to destroy boulders, and to kill or push enemies. The main point of each room is to destroy all of the boulders, by pushing them against a wall and hitting it again. Once all of the boulders are gone, one or two arrow panels will appear somewhere in the room. Touching one will take Godzilla to the room in a large map corresponding to its direction. As levels are completed, the direction is revealed on the map for further use. There are three items in the game: the hourglass (or \\"sandglass\\"), the heart, and the lightning bolt (or \\"thunder\\"). The hourglass stops all enemy movement for a short period of time. The heart increases Godzilla's health. The lightning bolt kills all enemies on-screen, except for Ghidorah. =Saving= The game uses a password system to save. There are two variations: a four-character password and an eighteen-character password. Four-character passwords only save the player's position on the map, while eighteen-character passwords save the revealed map points. Neither of them save extra lives or the player's score. =Monsters= Each character is briefly outlined in the game's manual *Godzilla: The first playable character. He must punch boulders through 64 levels, in order to find his son. *Minilla: Godzilla's son, who was captured and placed in the heart of the Labyrinth of Matrix. He is only seen in the end, and does not appear in any of the levels. *Baragon: A slow moving enemy. *Mechagodzilla: One of Godzilla's main rivals, with a speed that is slightly slower than Godzilla's. *Hedorah (or \\"Hedrah\\"): A normally invincible monster, that can only be defeated by a boulder, a spike pit, or a lightning bolt. He is also the slowest in movement. *Anguirus (or \\"Anguillas\\"): A mutant Ankylosaurus that is usually an ally of Godzilla. Normally is a regular paced enemy, but once he is leveled with Godzilla, he will charge at a high speed, making him the fastest in the game. *Rodan: A mutant pterosaur that, just like Anguirus, is usually Godzilla's ally, but now an enemy who flies after him, making it harder to avoid damage. *Ghidorah (or \\"Ghidrah\\"): A mutant space dragon. After about two minutes, Ghidorah will appear. Having both invincibility and flight, it is very hard to make it past him. He can't be killed by anything. Ghidorah also flies in short bursts. Japanese version There are a few differences in the Japanese version when compared to the international versions: *Godzilla moves faster in the Japanese version, with his speed having been decreased in the international versions. *When fighting Hedorah, the player can punch him, instead of pushing him back and stunning him. *King Ghidorah can actually be taken out in the Japanese version, not in the international versions, where he is invincible. *The monsters' graphics are different from the international versions. *There is a two-player mode that does not appear in the international versions.

It has been called: \\"the church that introduced Christian Science to Southern California.\\"City of Riverside - Landmarks of the City of Riverside It was designed by noted Los Angeles architect Arthur Burnett Benton.Arthur B. Benton, Architect, (1858-1927), By Charles J. Fisher On September 22, 1992, First Church of Christ, Scientist, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is still listed in the Christian Science Journal as an active Christian Science church.Christian Science Journal, December, 2007, p. 99 Christian Science was discovered by Mary Baker Eddy in 1866. October 24, 1900, was the occasion of the laying of the cornerstone for First Church of Christ, Scientist, Riverside. Notice of completion of the construction of the building was filed February 10, 1901. The dedication and first regular Sunday service were held on February 24 of that year. Christian Science had actually been publicly introduced in Riverside some nine years previous, and the Christian Science Journal for October 1891 has listed: “Regular Sunday Services of Scientists.” They met in the home of Emma Stanton Davis, a student of Mrs. Eddy, who had moved to Riverside in 1887 and began healing work. Records in the Archives of the Mother Church in Boston, Massachusetts, show that Riverside was the first location in California where a class-taught student lived. The architectural style of this church is primarily Mission Revival due to the influence of the renowned architect, Arthur Benton. Just one block from the church is Benton's Mission Inn, which is internationally known. He also designed the Riverside Municipal Auditorium which borders on the south end of the church property. The interior of the church was designed in the craftsman tradition with natural or lightly stained wood, with vertical and horizontal beams exposed. In the 1950s, all wood and ceiling rafters were covered and painted white with a blue decoration.

Early life Prior to enlisting in the Anderson Zouaves Infantry Regiment of New York (later the Sixty-second New York State Volunteers), Nevin had worked as a coal merchant in New York City. Civil War Nevin enlisted in the Union Army on April 27, 1861, at New York City as Captain of Company 'D' of the Anderson Zouaves. He received his commission on June 30, 1861. With the resignation of the regiment's lieutenant colonel William S. Tisdale, Nevin was promoted to lieutenant colonel a position which became effective on October 25, 1861. A muster roll dated October 15, 1861 makes the comment that Nevin's promotion was made \\"…by desire of the major (Oscar Veniah Dayton) and every line officer. Sanctioned by the Brig. General (John James Peck)\\". Nevin's promotion from captain to lieutenant colonel appears to have been a reward for good service while the regiment was encamped at Tennallytown, DC. Upon arrival at the encampment the colonel, lieutenant colonel and major were found to be absent and the regiment demanded that Nevin take command. Nevin acted in the capacity of senior officer for several weeks before handing in his resignation to Peck who forwarded it to Major General McClellan with the recommendation that it be rejected. With the death of the regiment's colonel, John Lafayette Riker at the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862, Nevin assumed command of the regiment a promotion which became effective on June 20, 1862. Nevin received special commendation from General Peck for his gallantry at the Battle of Fair Oaks. At the Battle of Malvern Hill, Nevin, due to sickness, commanded the regiment from an army ambulance. In late 1862 Nevin was sentenced \\"to be cashiered,\\" by a general court-martial. However, in April 1863 his sentence was disapproved by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton and he was released from arrest, and restored to his command. After the removal of McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac a conspiracy against Nevin by his superior officers was discovered, and Governor Seymour was \\"…called upon to see that justice was done to one of whose services the State might well be proud.\\"Townsend, Thomas Seaman, 1889, The Honors of the Empire State in the War of the Rebellion, New York, p. 201. Nevin was mustered out of the regiment on June 29, 1864 at Petersburg, Va. He was succeeded by Lieut. Colonel Theodore B. Hamilton who commanded the regiment until it was mustered out at Fort Schuyler New York on August 30, 1865.

Owned and managed by General Growth Properties, the mall has on one floor and six anchors including JCPenney, 2 stores for both Macy's and Dillard's, Round One Entertainment (coming Spring 2021) and AMC Theatres which opened in 2017 on the west end of the mall. There is also a freestanding Target. As of 2018, Pembroke Lakes Mall is one of Miami's most popular and visited malls, thriving since its 1992 opening. History The mall opened on October 28, 1992, with space for six anchor stores, just like North Point Mall a year later. Upon opening, only four anchor spaces were occupied: two-story Burdines (which opened on September 19), JCPenney, and Sears stores and a one-level Mervyn's, in a similar fashion to Pompano Fashion Square. Pembroke Lakes Mall (alongside The Mall at Wellington Green), are among the very few malls in the Miami area that has opened without a Jordan Marsh store because their Florida stores were disbanded before these malls were built. JCPenney and Burdines had moved in from the Hollywood Fashion Center six miles east while Sears moved from the Hollywood Mall. Dillard's (which opened its first South Florida store at The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale in 1993), filled the fifth anchor pad opened by opening its second area store on August 16, 1995. This was likewise done at North Point a year later, while stores also opened at the newly opened Seminole Towne Center and Lakeline Mall during this time (Another area store at Wellington Green eventually opened within that mall in 2001). The mall gained a second Dillard's in 1997 as Mervyns sold 10 Florida stores to the Little Rock-based retailer. Burdines merged with Macy's in 2003 and then became simply Macy's in 2005. Macy's would also fill the sixth anchor pad as a second location. Like all Macy's in Florida that used to be Burdines, the palm tree columns reminiscent the Burdines style of architecture remains today. In 2016, GGP announced that the mall's Sears shrunk to make room for an AMC movie theater, which opened in 2017. Sears closed on September 15, 2019. In Q3 2019, Round One Entertainment announced that a new location would open in Pembroke Lakes Mall in Spring 2021, in the former vacant anchor store, making it the first and only Round One in all of Florida (contract currently negotiating with Coral Square in Coral Springs, Florida as well).

It is a measure of the utilization rate, or efficiency of electrical energy usage; a high load factor indicates that load is using the electric system more efficiently, whereas consumers or generators that underutilize the electric distribution will have a low load factor. f_{Load} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Average Load}}{ \\\\text{Maximum load in given time period}} An example, using a large commercial electrical bill: * peak demand = * use = * number of days in billing cycle = Hence: * load factor = { / ( × 24 hours per day × ) } × 100% = 18.22% It can be derived from the load profile of the specific device or system of devices. Its value is always less than one because maximum demand is never lower than average demand, since facilities likely never operate at full capacity for the duration of an entire 24-hour day. A high load factor means power usage is relatively constant. Low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set. To service that peak, capacity is sitting idle for long periods, thereby imposing higher costs on the system. Electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kWh. This process along with others is called load balancing or peak shaving. The load factor is closely related to and often confused with the demand factor. f_{Demand} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Maximum load in given time period}}{\\\\text{Maximum possible load}} The major difference to note is that the denominator in the demand factor is fixed depending on the system. Because of this, the demand factor cannot be derived from the load profile but needs the addition of the full load of the system in question.

They can be classified historically as follows: * The medieval fortifications dating from the 12th century * The bastioned fortifications dating from the 17th century * The ring fortification system dating from the 19th century Medieval fortifications (12th–15th centuries) The first fortification was the castle built by bishop Absalon in 1167 on Slotsholmen at the foundation of the city. This stood for 200 years until it was destroyed by the Hanse in 1369. It was replaced in 1417 by the Copenhagen Castle built by the then bishop, but taken over by the king, Eric of Pomerania. The ruins of both these castles are visible to the public view under the Christiansborg Palace. Bastioned Fortifications (17th century) The city was extensively fortified by Christian IV in the mid 17th century. To the west the city was protected by a series of ramparts and bastions northwards from the Indrehavn, below Langebro. The remains of these works can be seen in the parks at Tivoli, Ørstedsparken, the Botanical Garden and Østre Anlæg. To the north, at the end of the wall, a fort was built, the Kastellet. To the east land was reclaimed from the sea to enclose the harbour; this land was also fortified with a rampart and ditch and a series of bastions. This now forms the district of Christianshavn.  Ring Fortification system (1886–94)  The most recent fortification of Copenhagen dates from the late 19th century. To the west was a fortification ring consisting of a rampart and ditch, with numerous bastions and batteries (Vestvolden). To the north, beyond a line of inundations around Utterslev Mose, lie 5 detached land forts (Bagsværd Fort, Fortunfortet, Garderhøj Fort, Gladsaxe Fort, Lyngby Fort), backed to the south by 7 small batteries. Along the coast, and connecting with the land defences were two bands of Naval forts or batteries; the first (inner) band comprising 3 older forts (Trekroner, Lynetten and Strickers Batteri) and 3 new (Kalkbrænderi Batteri, Mellemfortet and Prøvestenen); and a second of 2 coastal forts (Charlottenlund, Kastrup) and a sea fortress (Middelgrundsfortet), plus 2 inland batteries (Avedøre and Hvidøre) to reinforce the Vestvolden. A third, outer line was added fifteen years later. The design of the forts was guided by the principles of Brialmont.  Coastal defenses (1909–16)  The group of new coastal forts were constructed at the beginning of World War I. These were (clockwise): Taarbæk Fort, connecting to the northern fort line; Flakfortet, at sea beyond Middelgrundsfortet; and Dragør Fort, Kongelundsfortet, Mosede Fort to the south.

The term is most commonly used in reference to using mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones, tablet computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wearable devices such as smart watches, for health services, information, and data collection. The mHealth field has emerged as a sub-segment of eHealth, the use of information and communication technology (ICT), such as computers, mobile phones, communications satellite, patient monitors, etc., for health services and information. mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices in collecting community and clinical health data, delivery/sharing of healthcare information for practitioners, researchers and patients, real-time monitoring of patient vital signs, the direct provision of care (via mobile telemedicine) as well as training and collaboration of health workers. While mHealth has application for industrialized nations, the field has emerged in recent years as largely an application for developing countries, stemming from the rapid rise of mobile phone penetration in low-income nations. The field, then, largely emerges as a means of providing greater access to larger segments of a population in developing countries, as well as improving the capacity of health systems in such countries to provide quality healthcare. Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, including increased access to healthcare and health-related information (particularly for hard-to-reach populations); improved ability to diagnose and track diseases; timelier, more actionable public health information; and expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers. According to an analyst firm, around 2.8 million patients worldwide were using a home monitoring service based on equipment with integrated connectivity at the end of 2012. The figure does not include patients that use monitoring devices connected to a PC or mobile phone. It only includes systems that rely on monitors with integrated connectivity or systems that use monitoring hubs with integrated cellular or fixed-line modems. It forecast that the number of home monitoring systems with integrated communication capabilities will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.9 percent between 2011 and 2017 reaching 9.4 million connections globally by the end of the forecast period. The number of these devices that have integrated cellular connectivity increased from 0.73 million in 2011 to about 1.03 million in 2012, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 46.3 percent to 7.10 million in 2017.mHealth and Home Monitoring by Berg Insight A growing percentage of health-related smartphone apps are available, and some estimates predicted that 500 million patients would be using such apps by the year 2015. There are concerns about the accuracy and unregulated status of health apps. Definitions SMS for Life program that uses cell phones to efficiently deliver malaria vaccine mHealth broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems. The field broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies in health care delivery. The term mHealth was coined by Robert Istepanian as use of \\"emerging mobile communications and network technologies for healthcare\\". A definition used at the 2010 mHealth Summit of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) was \\"the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices\\". While there are some projects that are considered solely within the field of mHealth, the linkage between mHealth and eHealth is unquestionable. For example, an mHealth project that uses mobile phones to access data on HIV/AIDS rates would require an eHealth system in order to manage, store, and assess the data. Thus, eHealth projects many times operate as the backbone of mHealth projects. In a similar vein, while not clearly bifurcated by such a definition, eHealth can largely be viewed as technology that supports the functions and delivery of healthcare, while mHealth rests largely on providing healthcare access. Because mHealth is by definition based on mobile technology such as smartphones, healthcare, through information and delivery, can better reach areas, people, and/or healthcare practitioners with previously limited exposure to certain aspects of healthcare.  Medical uses  mHealth apps are designed to support diagnostic procedures, to aid physician decision-making for treatments, and to advance disease-related education for physicians and people under treatment. Mobile health has much potential in medicine and, if used in conjunction with human factors may improve access to care, the scope, and quality of health care services that can be provided. Some applications of mobile health may also improve the ability to improve accountability in healthcare and improve continuum of care by connecting interdisciplinary team members. mHealth is one aspect of eHealth that is pushing the limits of how to acquire, transport, store, process, and secure the raw and processed data to deliver meaningful results. mHealth offers the ability of remote individuals to participate in the health care value matrix, which may not have been possible in the past. Participation does not imply just consumption of health care services. In many cases remote users are valuable contributors to gather data regarding disease and public health concerns such as outdoor pollution, drugs and violence. While others exist, the 2009 UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation report presents seven application categories within the mHealth field: *Education and awareness *Helpline *Diagnostic and treatment support *Communication and training for healthcare workers *Disease and epidemic outbreak tracking *Remote monitoring *Remote data collection =Education and awareness= Education and awareness programs within the mHealth field are largely about the spreading of mass information from source to recipient through short message services (SMS). In education and awareness applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users' phones to offer information about various subjects, including testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease management. SMSs provide an advantage of being relatively unobtrusive, offering patients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. Additionally, SMSs provide an avenue to reach far-reaching areas—such as rural areas—which may have limited access to public health information and education, health clinics, and a deficit of healthcare workers. =Helpline= Helpline typically consists of a specific phone number that any individual is able to call to gain access to a range of medical services. These include phone consultations, counseling, service complaints, and information on facilities, drugs, equipment, and/or available mobile health clinics. =Diagnostic support, treatment support, communication and training for healthcare workers= Diagnostic and treatment support systems are typically designed to provide healthcare workers in remote areas advice about diagnosis and treatment of patients. While some projects may provide mobile phone applications—such as a step-by-step medical decision tree systems—to help healthcare workers diagnosis, other projects provide direct diagnosis to patients themselves. In such cases, known as telemedicine, patients might take a photograph of a wound or illness and allow a remote physician diagnose to help treat the medical problem. Both diagnosis and treatment support projects attempt to mitigate the cost and time of travel for patients located in remote areas. mHealth projects within the communication and training for healthcare workers subset involve connecting healthcare workers to sources of information through their mobile phone. This involves connecting healthcare workers to other healthcare workers, medical institutions, ministries of health, or other houses of medical information. Such projects additionally involve using mobile phones to better organize and target in-person training. Improved communication projects attempt to increase knowledge transfer amongst healthcare workers and improve patient outcomes through such programs as patient referral processes. For example, the systematic use of mobile instant messaging for the training and empowerment of health professionals has resulted in higher levels of clinical knowledge and fewer feelings of professional isolation. =Disease surveillance, remote data collection, and epidemic outbreak tracking= Projects within this area operate to utilize mobile phones' ability to collect and transmit data quickly, cheaply, and relatively efficiently. Data concerning the location and levels of specific diseases (such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, Avian Flu) can help medical systems or ministries of health or other organizations identify outbreaks and better target medical resources to areas of greatest need. Such projects can be particularly useful during emergencies, in order to identify where the greatest medical needs are within a country Policymakers and health providers at the national, district, and community level need accurate data in order to gauge the effectiveness of existing policies and programs and shape new ones. In the developing world, collecting field information is particularly difficult since many segments of the population are rarely able to visit a hospital, even in the case of severe illness. A lack of patient data creates an arduous environment in which policy makers can decide where and how to spend their (sometimes limited) resources. While some software within this area is specific to a particular content or area, other software can be adapted to any data collection purpose. =Treatment support and medication compliance for patients, including chronic disease management= Remote monitoring and treatment support allows for greater involvement in the continued care of patients. Recent studies seem to show also the efficacy of inducing positive and negative affective states, using smart phones. Within environments of limited resources and beds—and subsequently a 'outpatient' culture—remote monitoring allows healthcare workers to better track patient conditions, medication regimen adherence, and follow-up scheduling. Such projects can operate through either one- or two-way communications systems. Remote monitoring has been used particularly in the area of medication adherence for AIDS, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, antenatal mental health, mild anxiety, and tuberculosis. Technical process evaluations have confirmed the feasibility of deploying dynamically tailored, SMS-based interventions designed to provide ongoing behavioral reinforcement for persons living with HIV. among others. In conclusion, the use of the mobile phone technology (in combination with a web-based interface) in health care results in an increase in convenience and efficiency of data collection, transfer, storage and analysis management of data as compared with paper-based systems. Formal studies and preliminary project assessments demonstrate this improvement of efficiency of healthcare delivery by mobile technology. Nevertheless, mHealth should not be considered as a panacea for healthcare. Possible organizational issues include the ensuring of appropriate use and proper care of the handset, lost or stolen phones, and the important consideration of costs related to the purchase of equipment. There is therefore a difficulty in comparison in weighing up mHealth interventions against other priority and evidence-based interventions. Criticism and concerns The extensive practice of mhealth research has sparked criticism, for example on the proliferation of fragmented pilot studies in low- and middle-income countries, which is also referred to as \\"pilotitis.\\" The extent of un-coordindated pilot studies prompted for instance the Ugandan Director General Health Services Dr Jane Ruth Aceng in 2012 to issue a notice that, \\"in order to jointly ensure that all eHealth efforts are harmonized and coordinated, I am directing that ALL eHealth projects/Initiatives be put to halt.\\"Republic of Uganda. (2012). Coordination and harmonisation of eHealth initiatives [circular ADM 45/273/01]. Kampala: Uganda Ministry of Health. The assumptions that justify mhealth initiatives have also been challenged in recent sociological research. For example, mobile phones have been argued to be less widely accessible and usable than is often portrayed in mhealth- related publications; people integrate mobile phones into their health behaviour without external intervention; and the spread of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries itself can create new forms of digital and healthcare exclusion, which mhealth interventions (using mobile phones as a platform) cannot overcome and potentially accentuate. Mhealth has also been argued to alter the practice of healthcare and patient-physician relationships as well as how bodies and health are being represented. Another widespread concern relates to privacy and data protection, for example in the context of electronic health records. Studies looking into the perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare professionals using mheath have found that most health care professionals appreciated being connected to their colleagues, however some prefer face to face communication. Some healthcare workers also felt that while reporting was improved and team members who require help or training could be more easily identified, some healthcare professionals did not feel comfortable being monitored continuously. A proportion of healthcare professionals prefer paper reporting. The use of mobile apps may sometimes lead to healthcare professionals spending more time performing additional tasks such as filling out electronic forms and may generate more workload in some cases. Some healthcare professionals also do not feel comfortable with work-related contact from patients/clients outside of business hours (however some professionals did find this useful for emergencies). Communicating with clients/patients while using a mobile device may need to be considered. A decrease in eye contact and the potential to miss non-verbal cues due to concentrating on a screen while speaking with patients is a potential consideration.  Society and Culture  = Healthcare in low- and middle-income countries = Disability-adjusted life year for all causes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Middle income and especially low-income countries face a plethora of constraints in their healthcare systems. These countries face a severe lack of human and physical resources, as well as some of the largest burdens of disease, extreme poverty, and large population growth rates. Additionally, healthcare access to all reaches of society is generally low in these countries. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from June 2011, higher-income countries show more mHealth activity than do lower-income countries (as consistent with eHealth trends in general). Countries in the European Region are currently the most active and those in the African Region the least active. The WHO report findings also included that mHealth is most easily incorporated into processes and services that historically use voice communication through conventional telephone networks. The report was the result of a mHealth survey module designed by researchers at the Earth Institute's Center for Global Health and Economic Development, Columbia University. The WHO notes an extreme deficit within the global healthcare workforce. The WHO notes critical healthcare workforce shortages in 57 countries—most of which are characterized as developing countries—and a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses, and midwives. The WHO, in a study of the healthcare workforce in 12 countries of Africa, finds an average density of physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population of 0.64. The density of the same metric is four times as high in the United States, at 2.6. The burden of disease is additionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. The burden of disease, measured in disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age, free of disease and disability, is about five times higher in Africa than in high-income countries. In addition, low- and middle-income countries are forced to face the burdens of both extreme poverty and the growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, an effect of new-found (relative) affluence. Considering poor infrastructure and low human resources, the WHO notes that the healthcare workforce in sub-Saharan Africa would need to be scaled up by as much as 140% to attain international health development targets such as those in the Millennium Declaration. The WHO, in reference to the healthcare condition in sub-Saharan Africa, states: > The problem is so serious that in many instances there is simply not enough > human capacity even to absorb, deploy and efficiently use the substantial > additional funds that are considered necessary to improve health in these > countries. Mobile technology has made a recent and rapid appearance into low- and middle- income nations. While, in the mHealth field, mobile technology usually refers to mobile phone technology, the entrance of other technologies into these nations to facilitate healthcare are also discussed here.  Health and development  The link between health and development can be found in three of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as set forth by the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000. The MDGs that specifically address health include reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV and AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; and increasing access to safe drinking water. A progress report published in 2006 indicates that childhood immunization and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are on the rise, while many regions continue to struggle to achieve reductions in the prevalence of the diseases of poverty including malaria, HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis. = Healthcare in developed countries = In developed countries, healthcare systems have different policies and goals in relation to the personal and population health care goals. In US and EU many patients and consumers use their cell phones and tablets to access health information and look for healthcare services. In parallel the number of mHealth applications grew significantly the last years. Doctors, nurses and clinicians use mobile devices to access patient information and other databases and resources.  Technology and market  Basic SMS functions and real-time voice communication serve as the backbone and the current most common use of mobile phone technology. The broad range of potential benefits to the health sector that the simple functions of mobile phones can provide should not be understated. The appeal of mobile communication technologies is that they enable communication in motion, allowing individuals to contact each other irrespective of time and place.Agar, J. (2003). Constant Touch: A Global History of the Mobile Phone Cambridge: Icon Books Ltd.Ling, R. (2004). The mobile connection: The cell phone's impact on society London: Morgan Kaufmann This is particularly beneficial for work in remote areas where the mobile phone, and now increasingly wireless infrastructure, is able to reach more people, faster. As a result of such technological advances, the capacity for improved access to information and two-way communication becomes more available at the point of need. = Mobile phones = Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997–2007 With the global mobile phone penetration rate drastically increasing over the last decade, mobile phones have made a recent and rapid entrance into many parts of the low- and middle-income world. Improvements in telecommunications technology infrastructure, reduced costs of mobile handsets, and a general increase in non-food expenditure have influenced this trend. Low- and middle-income countries are utilizing mobile phones as \\"leapfrog technology\\" (see leapfrogging). That is, mobile phones have allowed many developing countries, even those with relatively poor infrastructure, to bypass 20th century fixed-line technology and jump to modern mobile technology. The number of global mobile phone subscribers in 2007 was estimated at 3.1 billion of an estimated global population of 6.6 billion (47%). These figures are expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2012, or a 64.7% mobile penetration rate. The greatest growth is expected in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In many countries, the number of mobile phone subscribers has bypassed the number of fixed-line telephones; this is particularly true in developing countries. Globally, there were 4.1 billion mobile phones in use in December 2008. See List of countries by number of mobile phones in use. While mobile phone penetration rates are on the rise, globally, the growth within countries is not generally evenly distributed. In India, for example, while mobile penetration rates have increased markedly, by far the greatest growth rates are found in urban areas. Mobile penetration, in September 2008, was 66% in urban areas, while only 9.4% in rural areas. The all India average was 28.2% at the same time.Kathuria, R, Uppal M., Mamta (2009). An econometric analysis of the impact of mobile. Case paper in India: The impact of mobile phones. Vodafone Group Plc. The Policy Paper Series. November 2009 So, while mobile phones may have the potential to provide greater healthcare access to a larger portion of a population, there are certainly within-country equity issues to consider. Mobile phones are spreading because the cost of mobile technology deployment is dropping and people are, on average, getting wealthier in low- and middle-income nations. Vendors, such as Nokia, are developing cheaper infrastructure technologies (CDMA) and cheaper phones (sub $50–100, such as Sun's Java phone). Non-food consumption expenditure is increasing in many parts of the developing world, as disposable income rises, causing a rapid increase spending on new technology, such as mobile phones. In India, for example, consumers have become and continue to become wealthier. Consumers are shifting their expenditure from necessity to discretionary. For example, on average, 56% of Indian consumers' consumption went towards food in 1995, compared to 42% in 2005. The number is expected to drop to 34% by 2015. That being said, although total share of consumption has declined, total consumption of food and beverages increased 82% from 1985 to 2005, while per-capita consumption of food and beverages increased 24%. Indian consumers are getting wealthier and they are spending more and more, with a greater ability to spend on new technologies. = Smartphones = More advanced mobile phone technologies are enabling the potential for further healthcare delivery. Smartphone technologies are in now in the hands of a large number of physicians and other healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries. Although far from ubiquitous, the spread of smartphone technologies opens up doors for mHealth projects such as technology-based diagnosis support, remote diagnostics and telemedicine, preprogrammed daily self-assessment prompts, video or audio clips, web browsing, GPS navigation, access to web-based patient information, post-visit patient surveillance, and decentralized health management information systems (HMIS). While uptake of smartphone technology by the medical field has grown in low- and middle-income countries, it is worth noting that the capabilities of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries has not reached the sophistication of those in high-income countries. The infrastructure that enables web browsing, GPS navigation, and email through smartphones is not as well developed in much of the low- and middle-income countries. Increased availability and efficiency in both voice and data-transfer systems in addition to rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure will likely accelerate the deployment of mobile-enabled health systems and services throughout the world. = Other technologies = Beyond mobile phones, wireless-enabled laptops and specialized health-related software applications are currently being developed, tested, and marketed for use in the mHealth field. Many of these technologies, while having some application to low- and middle-income nations, are developing primarily in high-income countries. However, with broad advocacy campaigns for free and open source software (FOSS), applications are beginning to be tailored for and make inroads in low- and middle-income countries. Some other mHealth technologies include: *Patient monitoring devices *Mobile telemedicine/telecare devices *Microcomputers *Data collection software *Mobile Operating System Technology *Mobile applications (e.g., gamified/social wellness solutions) *Chatterbots Mobile device operating system technology Technologies relate to the operating systems that orchestrate mobile device hardware while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability are required to build trust. This may foster greater adoption of mHealth technologies and services, by exploiting lower cost multi purpose mobile devices such as tablets, PCs, and smartphones. Operating systems that control these emerging classes of devices include Google's Android, Apple's iPhone OS, Microsoft's Windows Mobile, and RIM's BlackBerry OS. Operating systems must be agile and evolve to effectively balance and deliver the desired level of service to an application and end user, while managing display real estate, power consumption and security posture. As advances in capabilities such as integrating voice, video and Web 2.0 collaboration tools into mobile devices, significant benefits can be achieved in the delivery of health care services. New sensor technologies such as HD video and audio capabilities, accelerometers, GPS, ambient light detectors, barometers and gyroscopes can enhance the methods of describing and studying cases, close to the patient or consumer of the health care service. This could include diagnosis, education, treatment and monitoring. Air quality sensing technologies Environmental conditions have a significant impact to public health. Per the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution accounts for about 1.4% of total mortality. Utilizing Participatory sensing technologies in mobile telephone, public health research can exploit the wide penetration of mobile devices to collect air measurements, which can be utilized to assess the impact of pollution. Projects such as the Urban Atmospheres are utilizing embedded technologies in mobile phones to acquire real time conditions from millions of user mobile phones. By aggregating this data, public health policy shall be able to craft initiatives to mitigate risk associated with outdoor air pollution. =Data= Data has become an especially important aspect of mHealth. Data collection requires both the collection device (mobile phones, computer, or portable device) and the software that houses the information. Data is primarily focused on visualizing static text but can also extend to interactive decision support algorithms, other visual image information, and also communication capabilities through the integration of e-mail and SMS features. Integrating use of GIS and GPS with mobile technologies adds a geographical mapping component that is able to \\"tag\\" voice and data communication to a particular location or series of locations. These combined capabilities have been used for emergency health services as well as for disease surveillance, health facilities and services mapping, and other health-related data collection.  History  The motivation behind the development of the mHealth field arises from two factors. The first factor concerns the myriad constraints felt by healthcare systems of developing nations. These constraints include high population growth, a high burden of disease prevalence, low health care workforce, large numbers of rural inhabitants, and limited financial resources to support healthcare infrastructure and health information systems. The second factor is the recent rapid rise in mobile phone penetration in developing countries to large segments of the healthcare workforce, as well as the population of a country as a whole. With greater access to mobile phones to all segments of a country, including rural areas, the potential of lowering information and transaction costs in order to deliver healthcare improves. The combination of these two factors has motivated much discussion of how greater access to mobile phone technology can be leveraged to mitigate the numerous pressures faced by developing countries' healthcare systems. Research Emerging trends and areas of interest: *Emergency response systems (e.g., road traffic accidents, emergency obstetric care). *Human resources coordination, management, and supervision. *Mobile synchronous (voice) and asynchronous (SMS) telemedicine diagnostic and decision support to remote clinicians. *Clinician-focused, evidence-based formulary, database and decision support information available at the point of care. *Pharmaceutical supply chain integrity and patient safety systems (e.g. Sproxil and mPedigree). *Clinical care and remote patient monitoring. *Health extension services. *Inpatient monitoring. *Health services monitoring and reporting. *Health-related mLearning for the general public. *Mental health promotion and illness prevention *Training and continuing professional development for health care workers. *Health promotion and community mobilization. *Support of long-term conditions, for example medication reminders and diabetes self-management. *Peer-to-peer personal health management for telemedicine. *Social mobilization for infectious disease prevention. *Surgical follow-up, such as for major joint arthroplasty patients. *Mobile social media for global health personnel; for example, the capacity to facilitate professional connectedness, and to empower health workforce. According to Vodafone Group Foundation on February 13, 2008, a partnership for emergency communications was created between the group and United Nations Foundation. Such partnership will increase the effectiveness of the information and communications technology response to major emergencies and disasters around the world.

Comic book letter columns are also commonly referred to as letter columns (or lettercols), letter pages, letters of comment (LOCs), or simply letters to the editor. Letter columns appeared early on in the history of comic books themselves, and their growing prevalence — particularly beginning in the 1960s — helped create and legitimatize comics fandom. Letter columns remained a regular feature of most comic books until the early years of the 21st century, when they were gradually phased out in favor of the growing prevalence of email and Internet forums. History Although they were already standard in the science fiction magazines of the time, the first recorded comic book letter column appeared in Target Comics #6, published by Novelty Press in 1940.Overstreet, Robert M. Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, vol. 33. House of Collectibles, 2003. (The page in question also has an early mention of comic book collecting.) The first DC Comics comic to include a letters column was Real Fact Comics #3 (July-August 1946).Heritage Auction Galleries: Amazing Comics Auction #13011; Lot #15707. January 5, 2003 - Real Fact Comics #3. Retrieved November 16, 2008. The first DC title with a letters column as a regular feature was Superman beginning with issue #124 (September 1958). Early versions of the lettercol tended to be simple fan letters, often from young readers. These letters tended to be praise for the previous issue's story and artwork; or simplistic questions about the correct pronunciation of \\"Mxyzptlk\\" or where Superman put his Clark Kent clothes when he was in costume;Engblom, Mark. \\"Dear Editor: Metropolis Mailbag...After Dark!\\" Comic Coverage (September 17, 2007).

Mort Wieisinger's lettercolumns for the Superman titles . . . were big lists of 'goofs' that popped up in the books, that encouraged the worst kind of fan behavior (and indirectly inspired Stan [Lee] to create the No-Prize!).\\" Letter columns came into their prime in the 1960s, when readers' letters became longer and the discussions more sophisticated. For example, in the mid-1960s longtime letter writer (and future comics historian) Peter Sanderson's lengthy, well-reasoned, and impressively erudite missives forced DC editor Julie Schwartz to expand the lettercols in his books to a second, separate page (such as \\"Flash-Grams — Extra\\", \\"Letters To the Batcave — Extra\\", and \\"JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition\\") to facilitate Sanderson's sharp analysis.Hembeck, Fred. \\"The Fred Hembeck Show: Episode 21.\\" IGN Entertainment, August 2, 2005. Retrieved July 2, 2008. By the 1970s, nearly all mainstream comics included letter pages. Historian Matthew J. Pustz describes the different approaches of the two major publishers, DC and Marvel Comics: As the letter column became a longstanding tradition in the mainstream comic book industry, it even became a feature of underground, independent, and alternative comics of the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, a trend in letter writing developed in which readers would send in specific, bulleted questions about the direction of the series, plot points, etc.; which were often answered (or evaded) by the writer or editor point-by-point. By the first few years of the 21st century, as comic- related forums sprang up all over the Internet, letter columns were gradually replaced by advertisements or in-house promotions. In 2002, DC officially ended the practice of the letter pageStuever, Hank. \\"A Dead-Letters Day: Comic Books End Printed Mail Columns As Fans Turn to Web,\\" Washington Post, page C1, December 10, 2002. — only to bring it back in 2011.Hyde, David. \\"DCU in 2011: DC Nation: Letter Columns Return to DC Comic Books,\\" DC Comics Fan News (January 11., 2013). Many independent titles (such as Usagi Yojimbo, Hellboy, Optic Nerve, Palookaville, The Walking Dead, Chew, and King-Cat Comics) still feature letters pages to this day. Form and content As standardized by the big mainstream American companies, the letter column was typically overseen by one of the comic's staff members, often the book's editor (or later on, the assistant editor), and occasionally the book's writer(s). The letters page was often used as a soapbox, where in addition to responding to reader comments, the editor would provide behind-the-scenes details about the comics world, announce changes to the title or the creative team, plea for more (or better) letters, needle the competition,\\"Marvel Bullpen Bulletins\\" (July 1966). Accessed February 15, 2009. and otherwise communicate with readers.Gruenwald, Mark. \\"Mark's Remarks Index.\\" Accessed July 9, 2008. Due to the monthly (or longer) lag between issues, a comic's letter column usually featured reader responses to issues about three-to-five months prior to the current one. Occasionally, if a story ran too long one month, or there were printer-related problems, a comic's letters page would be omitted that issue. This would often produce an outcry from deprived readers in later letter columns, accompanied by the requisite apologies and explanations. Until the late-1970s, letter columns were usually found in the middle of the book, when they mostly moved to the book's second-to-last page (the last page tending to be an advertisement).Stern, Roger, ed. \\"Avengers Assemble!\\" Avengers #186 (Marvel Comics, August 1979), p. 31: \\"... and while Jim [Shooter] thanks you for the kind words, he'd like to point out that it was Roger Stern's idea to move his letters pages back to page 31... a move with which — we're proud to say — most other editors have enthusiastically followed suit!\\" Toward the end of 1960 — thanks in no small part to the urging of motivated readers like Jerry Bails (later to be known as the '\\"father of comics fandom\\") and Roy Thomas — DC editor Julius Schwartz decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters, a custom of long standing in science fiction magazines and one which helped originate science fiction fandom (where Schwartz himself got his start in publishing). The first letters page with the letter writers' full addresses appeared in The Brave and the Bold #35 (May 1961).Schelly, Bill. The Golden Age of Comic Fandom, Hamster Press, 1995. Because of this practice, many readers connected with each other, becoming penpals, and starting communities of fans and/or publishing fanzines.

Peter Sanderson writes of Schwartz's letter columns: Similarly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief/publisher Stan Lee, Marvel Comics also decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters. Lee made it a priority to create a community of readers, giving them a sense of personal investment in Marvel and its titles. Lee's ambition to create a company aesthetic in this way was overwhelming successful; many Marvel fans would sign off their letters with the phrase, \\"Make Mine Marvel!\\" For many fans, having a letter printed was a badge of honor — especially if it was in one of the more high-profile letters pages. The feeling was that if one wrote enough good letters, it was possible to influence the direction of the comic and/or one's favorite characters. And as letters pages became more collaborative in this way, many became forums for long-running discussions among the editors and readers, with topics ranging from what defined a \\"mutant\\" to real-world issues such as religion, racism, feminism, gay rights, and the rights of the disabled.Franklin, Morris E.

For some time in the 1970s, Marvel editors (and assistant editors, like Mark Gruenwald)Christiansen, Jeff. \\"Mark Gruenwald,\\" Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.: \\"In Gruenwald's early days as an assistant editor, he would refer to himself on the letters page as an 'armadillo.'\\" Accessed February 12, 2009. responded to readers' letters in the guise of a \\"friendly armadillo.\\" Beginning in 1980, under new editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, Marvel instituted new letter column policies. One change was to let writers of certain titles (rather than the book's editor) manage the letters pages.Michelinie, David. Avengers #196 (Marvel Comics, June 1980): \\"As you may have already noticed in a number of other Marvel titles, some letters pages are now being conducted by the regular writers of the books in which they appear. . . . We feel that readers who care enough about a book to take the time to write to it should know that their letters are being read, and considered, by real people.\\" The other was to eliminate the conceit of the \\"armadillo\\" and have the books' editors or writers respond to letters under the own names.Michelinie, David. \\"Printed Circuits,\\" Iron Man #135, Marvel Comic, June 1980): \\"The armadillo is dead. . . . [W]e figured that our readers deserve to know who they're talking to, and to get answers back from real live humans who are directly involved with the titles you care about.\\" In later years, some DC Comics letters pages — like those in Lobo and Ambush Bug — used the humorous device of having the main character \\"respond\\" to letters. Marvel's Deadpool, as part of his regular practice of breaking the \\"fourth wall,\\" also answered his own letters. The letters page also functioned as another form of \\"house ad,\\" a place to promote the book, other books in the same line, or the comic book publishing company in general.Carlson, KC. \\"KC: LOC,\\" Westfield Comics (September 2008).. Retrieved September 28, 2008. Some had additional purposes such as in the 1980s The Question series, written by Dennis O'Neil, whose letters pages included a reading recommendation with each issue to complement the philosophical points illustrated in the feature story. =Letter column titles= The typical letters page had its own title, which was usually a reference to the book's hero or heroes. \\"Cape and Cowl Comments\\" (World's Finest Comics), \\"JLA Mailroom\\" (Justice League of America), \\"Legion Outpost\\" (Legion of Super-Heroes), \\"Metropolis Mailbag,\\" (Superman), \\"Avengers Assemble!\\" (Avengers), \\"Letters to the Living Legend,\\" (Captain America), \\"The Spider's Web\\" (The Amazing Spider-Man), and \\"X-Mail,\\" (Uncanny X-Men) are just a few examples of this tradition. Suicide Squad faced difficulties in this aspect, as the United States Postal Service objected to delivering what were labeled as \\"Suicide Notes.\\" Some books had trouble sticking with a lettercol title, and changed them on a more or less regular basis. It soon became a tradition to hold a contest for fans to write in with column title ideas, with the winning writer credited in the letters page. Similarly, when a new comic book series was created, readers were asked to submit names for the lettercol title right from the outset. Reader participation Jerry Bails may have been the first reader to believe he could influence the direction of his favorite comics. In the early 1960s, he bombarded the DC offices with suggestions for new superhero revivals such as was already happening with the Flash, the Justice League, and so on. For instance, in Justice League of America #4, the letters page is filled with missives from Bails under different pen names. He did everything he could to fool editor Julius Schwartz, including mailing the letters from all across the country. Later on, during the lettercol heyday of the 1970s and 1980s, many comics actively encouraged reader participation. Fans were asked to weigh in on a character's uniform changes, or in some cases, submit their own uniform designs, with the winning entry actually becoming the character's new costume.Fan-designed costumes for the Legion of Super-Heroes were published in Adventure Comics #403 (April 1971, after the Legion's run ended in that comic). In Superboy vol. 1, #183 (March 1972), Duo Damsel, Saturn Girl, Karate Kid, Projectra, and Shadow Lass wore these costumes; only those for Duo Damsel and Saturn Girl were adopted for the long-run. Readers of Tomb of Dracula and The Vision and Scarlet Witch limited series were asked to suggest names for the main characters' babies.Tomb of Dracula #48-51 (Marvel Comics, 1976), and The Vision and the Scarlet Witch vol. 2, #8 (May 1986), respectively. (Winners of contests liked these were often awarded with original artwork from the book in question.)Gravett, Paul. \\"Curt Swan: A Superman Walked Among Us,\\" Comic Book Marketplace (2002): \\"When it came to his original artwork, like many comic book journeymen of his time . . . [Curt] Swan was pretty cavalier about keeping any for himself. He had no problem that much of it [was] used to be given away to readers as letter column prizes. . . .\\"\\"Deliveries,\\" The Vision and the Scarlet Witch, vol. 2, #12 (Marvel Comics, September 1986). For team books like The Avengers, Justice League, or the Legion of Super-Heroes, fans were polled as to which characters should become permanent members, team leaders, or conversely, excised from the team. (Readers were also asked to suggest or vote on the title of the letter column. See further discussion below.) Many 1970s Marvel lettercols stressed the importance of reader feedback, such as this one from Power Man #24 (April 1975): \\"We don't score hits with every issue. Sometimes a story has flaws or just doesn't come up to snuff. Which is why your letters are so valuable to us in producing these comments. . . . So don't let anybody tell you your letters aren't important, people. They are vital to these magazines.\\"Wein, Len, ed. \\"Comments to Cage,\\" Power Man #24 (Marvel Comics, April 1975), p. 18. Similarly, (beginning in the 1980s) the most esteemed letterhacks were occasionally solicited to send letters based on early preview copies, thus helping to build a fan-base for a new title.Olson, Kevin Noel. \\"Cobb and Ten Rounds With Beau Smith,\\" Comics Bulletin, April 26, 2006. Retrieved July 14, 2008. And in a few cases, low- selling titles were saved from cancellation by groups of dedicated fans writing in to the company's editor-in-chief or publisher. =Letterhacks= Fans whose letters were published regularly became well known throughout the industry by virtue of their letters. Writer Mark Engblom describes the phenomenon this way: Some of the most prolific \\"LOCers\\" or \\"letterhacks\\" include Jerry Bails, T.M. Maple (who published over 3,000 letters), Augie De Blieck, Jr. (who claims to have published over 400 letters),De Blieck Jr., Augie. \\"Pipeline: A Decade of Siren,\\" Comic Book Resources (September 23, 2008)..

Retrieved September 28, 2008. As discussed above, some letterhacks gained entrée into an actual career in comics because of their letter-writing expertise. For instance, Bob Rozakis parlayed his frequent published letters to DC comics during the late 1960s and early 1970s into a job as DC's \\"Answer Man\\" and eventually a solid career as a DC writer. Kurt Busiek, Mary Jo Duffy, Mike Friedrich, Mark Gruenwald, Fred Hembeck, Tony Isabella, Paul Levitz, Ralph Macchio, Dean Mullaney, Martin Pasko, Diana Schutz, Beau Smith, Roy Thomas, and Kim Thompson are just a few of the many comic book professionals who got their starts as young letterhacks.

With money earned from local shows and T-shirt sales, they recorded a self-titled demo tape in 1986. The European Metal tape trading community took notice of the demo and the band received some enthusiastic reviews from fanzines and from German metal fans. After discovering another band with the same name, they changed theirs to Psychotic Waltz and recorded a new four-song demo in 1988. This new demo also found its way to the European Metal tape trading community and the band began to build their loyal European fanbase. In 1990, they debuted with their independently financed debut A Social Grace, which was released in Europe via a licensing deal with the German label Rising Sun Productions.D'agostino, John.

The album was very well received in Europe, being named album of the month in some European magazines, The situation in the US was more difficult, as the album was released under the band's own Sub Sonic Records label. With practically no promotion and minimal distribution, it remained an extremely underground item. In May of 1991, the band appeared at the Dynamo Festival in the Netherlands. After the tour, the band's guitarist, Dan Rock, suffered a near-fatal accident after falling from the underside of a bridge while rappelling. The band went on to record their second album, Into the Everflow.D'agostino, John. (May 27, 1992) Los Angeles Times Cardiff-Based Guitar Maker Scores a Hit on Rock Scene Section: CA- Calendar; Pg. 2. The album was recorded from August-October, 1992, at Phoenix Studios in Herne, Germany, and was produced by Mekong Delta's main man, Ralph Hubert. The CD was released in Europe on Dream Circle Records, and was very well received, getting album of the month honors in many European magazines. After Rock recovered, the band was nominated as the Best Hard Rock band at the 1992 San Diego Music Awards.D'agostino, John. (June 24, 1992) Los Angeles Times Music Awards Nominations Contain Many New Names Section: CA-Calendar; Pg. 2. By that time, the band was at the peak of its popularity. They signed a deal with Intercord in Europe for their third album, Mosquito. Recording took place in late 1994 in Record Plant and Mad Hatter studios in Los Angeles, with the help of the famous metal producer Scott Burns. The initial response for this album was mixed, as the more conventional songwriting that the band followed divided some fans who preferred their more technical approach from earlier albums. This was the last album that was recorded with their original lineup. A few months after the completion and initial release of Mosquito, original bassist Ward Evans left the band. They entered the studio once again in 1996, for what proved to be their last studio work together, Bleeding. This time, Scott Burns did the engineering, but the record was mixed by Dan Rock and engineered by Woody Barber. Before the band started touring in support for the new album, guitarist Brian McAlpin announced that he would not be able to follow the band due to familial obligations. He was replaced by Steve Cox for the band's final two European tours. New bass player Phil Cuttino filmed a promotional video for the track \\"Faded\\". This proved to be disastrous for the band, as an actress who appeared in the video sued the band in April 1998,Superior Court of San Diego County (April 3, 1998) Lazzarini v.

The lengthy court battle that followed, coupled with the different musical interests that the band members had, contributed to the band's initial demise. Buddy Lackey was the next to leave the band. For a short while, the remaining band members tried to continue with the band, but eventually each went his own way. Rock recorded two instrumental albums with his project Darkstar. Norm Leggio and Steve Cox created the band Teabag, and Buddy Lackey formed the bands Deadsoul Tribe and then The Shadow Theory, where he performed under the name Devon Graves. Psychotic Waltz reunited with its original line-up in 2010, touring Europe in support of Nevermore and Symphony X on The Power Of Metal tour, and have played various festival shows. Century Media Records released each of the band's four albums on vinyl individually, and also created a 6–LP box set titled \\"The Architects Arise: The First Ten Years\\" (limited to 500 copies) which contained the four albums plus demo recordings. The band also started to write material for a fifth studio album, which would be their first release in two decades. In July 2019, Psychotic Waltz signed to Inside Out Music and entered the studio to record their first album in 23 years. The album, The God-Shaped Void, was released on February 14, 2020.

Cameron was appointed as Director of Ecumenical Affairs by the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion in 2003, becoming Deputy Secretary General in 2004. He was secretary to the Lambeth Commission that wrote the Windsor Report. In this role, he was described by The Times as \\"the top canon lawyer who helps run the headquarters of the worldwide Anglican Communion\\", and it was also said of him that \\"although his name is not widely known outside the church, he is arguably the most influential clergyman behind the scenes within it\\". His work for reconciliation in the Anglican Communion led to the award of an honorary Doctorate of Divinity by the Episcopal Divinity School, Massachusetts.

Plot Param Gill has reportedly shot a film that is inspired by true events. At the heights of the swine flu scare, a hotel in Hong Kong was quarantined for one week. The story goes on to tell the sequence of events that follow. Production It was very hard to find a suitable location for the shoot. After months of scouting, a hotel was finalized in city of West Hollywood, California. On the first day of shoot, many hotel guests complained and the hotel management backed out. The shoot was then moved to city of Modesto, California. The entire hotel was reserved for the shoot. Most of the hotel employees were sent on paid leave for the duration of the shoot. Rumors of super natural sightings started making the rounds of nearly empty hotel, soon after the filming started. These rumors were started by Param Gill in his efforts to provide a spooky environment for the actors to enhance their performance. But things started to take a different course. The lead actress Mehr Hassan was locked inside the hotel room when the room door jammed. A mechanic had to be brought in to cut the lock and rescue the beautiful actress. She was totally freaked out since the lock was working perfectly fine just until the incident. The next day screenwriter, Sandeep Singh was discovered lying in front of the vending machine just after mid night. Emergency crews responded quickly and were able to revive him in few hours. He told the paramedics that he was just walking to vending machine to grab a bite when something punched him head on. He could not describe more than that. The special effects supervisor, Richard Miranda also experienced some strange presence in his room and he slept in his car for the duration of the shoot. Shooting was halted when most crew members threatened to quit. Param Gill changed the filming schedule. Rest of the filming was done in the day time by blocking out the doors and windows of hotel with sheets of black plastic.

Representation is unique. When 'x represents y' is true, it is not the same as other relations between things, like when 'x is next to y' or when 'x caused y' or when 'x met y', etc. Representation is different because, for instance, when 'x represents y' is true, y need not exist. This isn't true when say 'x is the square root of y' or 'x caused y' or 'x is next to y'. Similarly, when 'x represents y' is true, 'x represents z' can still be false, even when y = z. Intentionality encompasses relations that are both physical and mental. In this case, \\"Billy can love Santa and Jane can search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no unicorns.\\" History Franz Brentano, the nineteenth century philosopher, spoke of mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our thoughts. This idea encompasses his belief that one cannot desire something unless they actually have a representation of it in their minds. Dennis Stampe was one of the first philosophers in modern times to suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of reliable causes. Fred Dretskes book, Knowledge and the Flow of Information (1981), was a major influence on the development of informational theories, and although the theory developed there is not a teleological theory, Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later produced an informational version of teleosemantics. He begins with a concept of carrying information that he calls \\"indicating\\", explains that indicating is not equivalent to representing, and then suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function of indicating Related theories Teleosemantics, also known as biosemantics, is used to refer to the class of theories of mental content that use a teleological notion of function. Teleosemantics is best understood as a general strategy for underwriting the normative nature of content, rather than any particular theory. What all teleological theories have in common is the idea that semantic norms are ultimately derivable from functional norms. Attempts to naturalize semantics began in the late 1970s. Many attempts were and still are being made to bring natural-physical explanations to bear on minds and, specifically, to the question of how minds acquire content.Adams, Fred. \\"Thoughts and Their Contents: Naturalized Semantics.\\" In Philosophy of Mind 143. This is an interesting question; it is no surprise that it takes center stage in the philosophy of mind. Indeed, it is certainly an interesting question how minds, thought by those in the natural camp to be \\"natural physical objects\\", could have developed intentional properties. In the mid-1980s, with the works of Ruth Millikan and David Papineau (Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories and \\"Representation and Explanation\\", respectively) teleosemantics, a theory of mental content that attempts to address the question of content and intentionality of minds, was born. Ruth Millikan is perhaps the most vocal supporter of the teleosemantic program. Millikan's view differs from other teleosemantic views in myriad ways, but perhaps its most unusual characteristic is its distinction between the mechanisms that produce mental representations from those that consume mental representations.Macdonald, G, and Papineau, D. \\"Prospects and Problems for Teleosemantics,\\" in Teleosemantics 4. There is a representational function as a whole, at a composite level; and there are two \\"sub-functions\\",Shea, Nicholas. \\"Millikan's Contribution to Materialist Philosophy of Mind,\\" 6. the producer-function and the consumer-function. In terms that are easy to understand, let's take Millikan's own example of beavers splashing their tails. One beaver alerts other beavers to the presence of danger by splashing its tail on the surface of water. The splashing of the tail tells, or represents to, the other beavers that there is danger in the environment, and the other beavers dip into the water to avoid the danger. The splashing of the beaver's tail produces a representation; the other beavers consume the representation. The representation that the beavers consume guides their behavior in ways that relate to their survival. Of course, the foci of the teleosemantic program is internal representations, and not just representational states of affairs between two (or more) distinct, external entities. How does the picture of the producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations? Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying \\"The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations.\\" The consuming mechanisms are those that \\"use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end\\". Here, we have a picture similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system. One sub- function produces mental representations while the other sub-function consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition. The representations consumed by the consumer sub-function guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival. This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait. Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation. But that is a matter of how. Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place. The theory of asymmetric dependence, from Fodor, who says that his theory \\"distinguishes merely informational relations on the basis of their higher- order relations to each other: informational relations depend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. He gives an example of this theory when he says, \\"if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by horses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then they carry information about horses, etc. If however, such tokens are caused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they are caused by horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or property horse). Alternative theories =Indeterminacy of translation= 20th century American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine believed that linguistic terms do not have distinct meanings that accompany them because there are no such entities as \\"meanings\\". In his books, Word and Object (1960) and Ontological Relativity (1968), Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate an unknown language in order to outline his thesis. His thesis, the indeterminacy of translation, notes that there are many different ways to distribute purpose and meanings among words. Whenever a theory of translation is made it is commonly based upon context. An argument over the correct translation of an unidentified term depends on the possibility that the native could have spoken a different sentence. The same problem of indeterminacy would appear in this argument once again since any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language. Quine uses as an example the word \\"gavagai\\" spoken by a native upon seeing a rabbit. One can go the simplest route and translate the word to \\"Lo, a rabbit\\", but other possible translations such as \\"Lo, food\\" or \\"Let's go hunting\\" are completely reasonable given what the linguist knows. Subsequent observations can rule out certain possibilities as well as questioning the natives. But this is only possible once the linguist has mastered much of the natives' grammar and vocabulary. This is a big problem because this can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language, which admit multiple interpretations, as we have seen. =The intentional stance= Daniel C. Dennett's theory of mental content, the intentional stance, tries to view the behavior of things in terms of mental properties. According to Dennett: \\"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.\\" Dennett's thesis has three levels of abstraction: # The most tangible is the physical stance, which is at the level of physics and chemistry. This level is concerned with things such as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. # Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, which is at the level of biology and engineering. This level is concerned with things such as purpose, function and design. # Most abstract is the intentional stance, which is at the level of software and minds. This level is concerned with things such as belief, thinking and intent. Dennett states that the more concrete the level, the more accurate is in principle our predictions. Though if one chooses to view an object through a more abstract level, he will gain greater computational power by getting a better overall picture of the object and skipping over any extraneous details. Also, switching to a more abstract level has its risks as well as its benefits. If we applied the intentional stance to a thermometer that was heated to 500 °C, trying to understand it through its beliefs about how hot it is and its desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no useful information. The problem would not be understood until we dropped down to the physical stance to comprehend that it has been melted. Whether to take a particular stance should be decided by how successful that stance is when applied. Dennett argued that it is best to understand human beliefs and desires at the level of the intentional stance.

Jones (1822–1898). During Michael D. Jones's principalship, a row broke out between two rival factions within Welsh congregationalism over the seminary's constitution – Michael D. Jones and his followers wanted to keep and adhere to the old constitution but Rev. John Thomas of Liverpool and his followers wanted to impose a new constitution upon the seminary. Michael D. Jones's argument was that Rev. John Thomas's plan would only lead to the presbyterizing of the seminary and of the Congregational churches in general. This row lead to a split and for a period the Congregationalists had two seminaries in Bala, Thomas Lewis's seminary at Plasyndre and Michael D. Jones's at Bodiwan. But by 1886 Thomas Lewis's seminary had moved to Bangor. Michael D. Jones retired in 1892 and this paved the way to unite the two seminaries once again and this time at Bangor thus explaining the seminary's eclectic name: \\"Bala-Bangor\\". The seminary remained in Bangor until its closure in 1989 by which time it was under the principalship of R. Tudur Jones, the last in the distinguished line of Principals to serve the Congregational churches in Wales. The seminary was closed mainly because of lack of demand for two Congregational seminaries in Wales. The Memorial College (having moved from Brecon to Swansea and then to Aberystwyth) offered a more central location for a United College to serve the Congregational churches throughout Wales. Through the 1990s, the United College remained at Aberystwyth, until its closure – now Congregational training is based back in Bangor under the supervision of Rev. Euros Wyn Jones.

On December 7, 2016, the MYC4 Foundation informed its investors it has decided to cease its activity and to liquidate as solvent. The MYC4 Foundation was the independent, non-profit entity, accepting funds from donors and holding investors’ money on escrow and separate from MYC4 A/S. The MYC4 platform has been closed as of June 1st 2019 and will not be reopened. History MYC4 was founded as a joint venture in May 2006 by Mads Kjær, chairman and former CEO of the Kjær Group and Honorary Danish Consul to Ethiopia, and Tim Vang. MYC4 is currently headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark with a regional office in Nairobi, Kenya. As of beginning of 2011, it employs 7 people at its Danish office. Since the company's creation, 19,073 investors from 115 countries have invested more than € 15 million in 8,334 businesses in seven African countries - Uganda, Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda, Ghana, Senegal and Tanzania. Annual reports and up-to-date statistics are available. Method of operation African businesses apply for a loan at a local credit provider, partnering with MYC4. They specify the amount of money they need, the interest they would be willing to pay and the time they plan for repayment. Investors who have created accounts on the website can choose from these third-world businesses, which they then bid money towards supporting. They specify an amount, a target interest rate and a minimum interest rate. This process is known as a Dutch auction method and guarantees that the interest rate will be as low as possible, depending on the investor bids. Depending on the amount of money offered by investors, and the interest rates, individual bids can proceed at the target or a lower interest rate, or be cancelled. A bid can be as little as €5, repayment times are usually 6 to 12 months, sometimes 2 years. Providers, Administrators and MYC4 itself all charge a fee for their services. They vary, but they are stated on each loan, in order to create transparency. Major investments In December 2006, MYC4 received a €670,000 grant from the Danish Aid Agency under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 29 October 2008, The Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) decided to invest approximately €1.3 million in Africa through MYC4. The Minister for Development Cooperation of Denmark Ulla Tørnæs supports the decision. Risks As any investment, lending money via MYC4 carries risk. In the past, a significant number of loans defaulted, making investments effectively donations. After major restructuring, it was hoped that losses will reduce. As a result of this, the first quarterly report released in 2012 showed a portfolio risk that was the lowest in two years. This shows a net return for investors of -0.1%. Potential investors should carefully read the 'Risks' page of the MYC4 website. The forum,Link to disabled forum on MYC4 where investors could discuss issues, was disabled in October 2010, being replaced with a blog by the organizers. Liquidation On December 7, 2016, the MYC4 Foundation - via its liquidator - informed investors it has decided to cease its activity and to liquidate as solvent. Also the former board of directors of MYC4 Foundation came to the conclusion that there was no reason to maintain the MYC4 Foundation as an independent institution with its cost structure as the obtainable debt collections is coming to an end. Investors can withdraw their balance or donate their balance for distribution in accordance with the bylaws for MYC4 Foundation. The bylaws of the MYC4 foundation is stating that in case of liquidation the Foundations funds/donations shall be used for activities, which support the aims and objectives of the UNITED NATIONS concerning the extirpation of poverty.

An important figure in the history of the Russian conquest of Turkestan in the 19th Century, he was Governor-General of the Transcaspian Region (today's Turkmenistan). General Annenkov was the builder of the strategic Transcaspian Railway in its initial stages through what is now Turkmenistan, which made possible the bloody defeat of the Turkmen at Geok-Tepe in 1881. He was also involved in the planning of the Trans-Siberian railroad, which was under construction at the time of his death. He also played a major role in the Pendjeh Crisis of 1885, when the UK and Russia nearly went to war.  Education and Early Career  Born into the wealthy Annenkoff family, son of General Nicholas Annenkov, Governor of Odessa and the southwestern provinces and aide-de-camp to the Emperor, Michael studied at the Corps des Pages and was appointed general adjutant to the general staff of the Imperial Army at St. Petersburg.Colby, Frank and Peck, Harry Thurston. “The International Yearbook,” Dodd, Mead, & Co. 1900 From 1864-1866, during the Polish uprising, Michael earned a reputation as a competent commander and military tactician: by age 27 he had been made a Colonel of the Imperial Army and appointed Aide-de-Camp to Emperor Alexander III of Russia.O’Brien, Augustin. Petersburg & Warsaw. Oxford, London: page 128. 1864. In the 1870s, Michael served as Military Attaché to Germany, during the Franco-Prussian War, and then later to France. His writings on German military tactics during the war were widely read.Annenkoff, M.N. Observations and Views of a Russian Officer. 1871. By 1878 he had been appointed a Lieutenant-General of the Imperial Army. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) General Annenkoff was placed in charge of transportation, learning the valuable skills that would later make him one of the most prominent engineers of his era.Appletons’ Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events of the Year. D. Appleton & Co., 1900. He was awarded Serbian Order of the Cross of Takovo.  Central Asia  In the 1880s, General Annenkoff served on several campaigns in Central Asia, most notably against the Turkmen population (serving under General Mikhail Skobelev in the Merv campaign). In order to move troops and supplies, he supervised construction of the Trans-Caspian Railway. The original portion was opened in 1881 from Uzun- Ada on the Caspian Sea to Kyzyl Aryat (now Serdar in Turkmenistan). The line was opened to Ashkabad (now Ashgabat) in December 1885 and to Merv (modern Mary, Turkmenistan) in July 1886. The next section (which reached Bukhara by an 8-mile branch) was completed to Samarkand (in what is now Uzbekistan) in May 1888. He completed laying more than 1,000 miles of track in less than three years (1885–1888), which brought him immediate engineering fame. (The western terminus was later changed to Krasnovodsk.) He was honored by scientific bodies throughout Europe, including being appointed a vice- president of the International Congress of Geography (1891).Nature: International Weekly Journal of Science. Nature Publishing Group, Feb. 28, 1895. He later became a planner and chief promoter of the Trans-Siberian railroad.Obituary in The New York Times, 23 January 1899 General Annenkoff was involved in the annexation of the Emirate of Bukhara as a client state of the Czar.White, Andrew Dickson. Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White: With Portraits. The Century Co., 1905. Upon the death of Emir Mozaffar al-Din in 1885, General Annenkoff marched into Bukhara and put Emir's younger son on the throne. The Russian troops that were left behind placed the Emirate of Bukhara under control of the Russian Empire.Curzon, George Nathaniel. Russia in Central Asia in 1889 and the Anglo-Russian Question.

In 1878 the Vicomte de Vogüé and Miss Alexandra N. Annenkova were married at the Winter Palace, St. Petersburg. After his first marriage to Baroness Alexandra Zubova ended, in 1883 General Annenkov married Dagmar Elisabeth von Oesterreich (19 years old). The marriage was dissolved in 1889. General Michael N. Annenkoff died in St. Petersburg on 9 (21 New Style) January 1899, reportedly by suicide. There was suspicion that he had misappropriated funds from the Trans-Caspian Railway.In Foreign Lands.

At the outbreak of World War I, the yacht was leased by the United States Navy, and was used as a section patrol craft in the North Atlantic Ocean. She served honorably during the war, rescuing survivors at sea, and attacking a German U-Boat. At war’s end, she was converted to her original configuration and returned to her owner, the railroad executive, financier, and philanthropist Frederick W. Vanderbilt (1856-1938) of New York City.  Built in Bath, Maine  Virginia - a steel-hulled, single-screw steam yacht designed by G. L. Watson and built at Bath, Maine, by Bath Iron Works for New York City merchant Isaac Stern — was delivered on 23 December 1899. In 1916, the yacht was acquired by the Frederick W. Vanderbilt and renamed Vedette.  Acquired by the U.S. Navy  The Navy acquired the ship from Vanderbilt on a free-lease basis on 4 May 1917. Earmarked for convoy escort and patrol duty overseas, Vedette was assigned the section patrol number SP-163 and was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, on 28 May 1917 with Lieutenant Commander Chester L. Hand in command.  World War I service  = Sailing for France = Vedette and five other patrol vessels - all former yachts - got underway from Tompkinsville on Staten Island, New York, bound for Bermuda on 9 June 1917 on the first leg of their voyage to France. and were the first to weigh anchor; , , , and Vedette followed. The ships formed up into divisions, with Vedette leading the second group. On the evening of the 12 June 1917, they anchored in St. George's harbor at Bermuda. They remained in Bermuda for a little over three days, coaling ship and taking on water. The vessels got underway again on the morning of 16 June 1917 and reached the Azores on 25 June 1917. = Witnessing the debris of war = After coaling and taking on water and provisions in the Azores, Vedette and her consorts began their passage to Brest, France. En route, they soon encountered abundant evidence that they were entering a war zone. Vedette spotted \\"considerable floating wreckage and a cork life belt\\" upon which no name was visible on the evening of 2 July 1917. The next morning, she spotted more of the same: boxes, barrels, a broken life-belt, and pieces of planking from an anonymous ship or ships — mute evidence of a sinking. The squadron sighted the French coast at 0440 on 4 July 1917, but before they could make it into port, Christabel broke down and Vedette stood by until she could get underway again. Later, as the ships made their way toward Brest, a French torpedo boat came out and greeted the American force. The six patrol vessels were among the first ships of the United States Navy to reach French waters in World War I. Over the next 10 days, Vedette prepared for the operations that lay ahead. She finally put to sea, in company with Harvard, on the morning of 16 July 1917. = Assigned to convoy patrol duty = Her first patrol pretty much set the standard theme for the many that followed. The two ships initially headed for the middle of the patrol line 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometers) off the coast, extending from the northward and westward of Ushant to the southward of Belle Île. Vedette patrolled the southern half of the line while Harvard prowled the northern. Vedette returned to Brest on 19 July 1917, without having met the enemy, but she did encounter more wreckage, including life rings from an unidentified ship. She twice more patrolled the area between Brest and Ushant, near Belle Isle, before the end of July 1917. Vedette remained in port the first few days of August 1917, and she suffered slight damage on the morning of 3 August 1917 when Christabel - while shifting moorings — raked her stern, carrying away the flagstaff and damaging the after rail. Nevertheless, Vedette stood out to sea at 1700 that afternoon in the screen of an outward-bound convoy of 10 merchant ships which were also protected by Harvard, three French patrol vessels, and two British ships. Vedette left that convoy at 0050 on 4 August 1917 and patrolled the vicinity until 0650, when she picked up a Brest-bound convoy of 19 merchantmen escorted by three patrol boats. Vedette anchored at Brest at 1025 the same day, but her respite was short. Less than six hours later, she stood out with a convoy of 16 merchantmen, three French patrol boats, and Harvard. Vedette left that convoy when it passed out of the coastal danger zone and waited to pick up a Brest-bound convoy at 1655 on 5 August 1917. While en route in, Harvard broke down, and Vedette stood by until her longstanding partner was ready to proceed. = Friendly fire = Still en route to Brest during the pre-dawn hours of 6 August 1917, Vedette sighted a \\"suspicious vessel\\" at 0320 and opened fire with her number two 3-inch (76.2-mm) gun. The shot fell well forward of the stranger, who soon signaled that she was a French patrol boat. Vedette's first shot of the war had been aimed at a \\"friendly\\" ship. Vedette was docked at Brest shortly after noon that day for alterations. After the work was completed during the forenoon watch (0800-1200) on 7 August 1917, the ship was towed back to her former berth, where she provisioned and made ready to return to the Ushant-Brest patrol line. = Convoy ship strikes a mine = Vedette escorted an outward- bound convoy late on 9 August 1917, and an inward-bound one on 10 August 1917, before she and Harvard were assigned to another outward-bound group of 10 merchantmen and two French patrol vessels. At 2010, Vedette's watch heard an explosion astern, accompanied by several blasts of a ship's whistle. A British merchantman, last in line of the convoy, had struck a naval mine; nearby, a French vessel rescued 14 men before the rapidly sinking ship disappeared. Twelve men had died in the explosion. After delivering the convoy to Quiberon Bay, Vedette anchored at 0645, but that evening again got underway — with a convoy of eight merchantmen, two French patrol vessels, and Harvard—and arrived back at Brest with that group at noon on the following day. On the morning of 15 August 1917, Vedette was underway again and conducted convoy escort operations through the next day. = Rescuing crew members of torpedoed ship = At 0650 on 17 August 1917, the Greek steamship Pontoporos—bound from Tyne Dock to Spezia with a cargo of 4,600 tons of coal and 2,000 tons of coke — was hit by a torpedo on the starboard beam. It exploded eight feet (2.4 m) below the waterline, abreast the engine room, and tore up the decking topside. Vedette rang up full speed ahead and stood about, hunting for the submarine. Unable to make contact with the enemy, the yacht picked up 27 men from a lifeboat, including the master of Pontoporos, a Captain Panas, at 0715. Two more men were transferred from a French fishing boat five minutes later. Vedette soon cast the lifeboat adrift at 0725 and circled the sinking ship; at 0740, Pontoporos sank from sight. After Vedette reached Port Heliguen later that morning, she turned the 29 survivors over to French authorities. Vedette continued the same routine of operations — interspersed with periods of upkeep, maintenance, and provisioning — through the remainder of the summer and autumn of 1917 and into 1918. On 20 January 1918, Lieutenant Commander Hand was relieved as commanding officer by Lieutenant Charles Alan Pownall (1887-1975), a future rear admiral who would command aircraft carrier task force during World War II and later serve as governor of Guam. = Updating anti-submarine weapons = By January 1918, the ship's armament reflected the multi-national character of the escort work performed out of Brest, for not only did she carry her original allotment of 10 American Sperry Mk. I \\"Mines\\", but also eight French Guirand charges and three British Type \\"D\\" ones. By the summer of 1918, that had again changed, and the ship carried, by that point, 21 American Mark 2 depth charges. = Vedette goes to general quarters = Vedettes routine changed little in 1918. Her only encounter with the enemy, however, came on 5 August 1918. Underway from Quiberon Bay at 0435 that day, she was steaming at the head of a convoy of 11 ships; other escorts were Harvard, the patrol vessel , and the torpedo boat Stewart (Coast Torpedo Vessel No. 13). At 0802, the convoy passed Point de Chats abeam to port, distance three nautical miles (5.6 kilometers); at 0812, the ships changed course so that by 0835, they were off Pen Men, abeam to port at a distance of two and one-half nautical miles (4.6 kilometers). At 0924, Vedettes watch felt a slight jar; within a minute, they saw that the merchant ship SS Hundvaago had taken a torpedo and was sinking rapidly. Vedette went to full speed ahead and sprang to general quarters. At 0927, Signalman 3rd Class Nye, Chief Quartermaster Teiper, and the officer of the deck saw a submarine off the starboard quarter of the convoy. Vedette heeled as the helm was put over at hard right rudder and she raced toward the enemy. She sounded five short blasts on her whistle, but a merchant ship obstructed her view of the submarine, and the periscope disappeared. Vedette immediately commenced a search, circling and trying to locate the enemy submersible. At 0935, Vedette received orders from Harvard and, in company with Stewart, quickly proceeded to reform the panic-stricken convoy. Within 20 minutes, Hundvaago had sunk, another U-boat victim. An hour before noon, Vedette resumed her position at the head of the convoy and, 45 minutes later, took station on the port flank of the convoy. Things were not quiet for long, however. At one minute past noon, a French seaplane, attracted to the scene of the torpedoing, dropped a smoke bomb, indicating the presence of what looked like a submarine. Vedette again went to general quarters and put over hard right rudder as she sped off to the hunt. She soon picked up a small oil wake about 200 yards (183 m) east of the smoke bomb and dropped a barrage of eight depth charges at 1215. Ten minutes later, having seen \\"no further evidence of a submarine,\\" Vedette rejoined the convoy, taking station on the port bow. Stewart later dropped four depth charges over a 15-minute period but failed to learn whether or not she had tangled with a submarine. She nevertheless continued the hunt, in company with Vedette, Harvard, and Remlick, while the newly arrived destroyer Tucker (Destroyer No. 57) joined the convoy's screen. = Rescuing a downed French plane = However, Vedette's work for that day was not complete until she had assisted a downed French seaplane from the French Naval Air Service. At 1718, another French plane had dropped a message requesting aid in Baie de Douarnenez. A bit under an hour later, Vedette lowered her motorboat, which that took the pilots aboard and took the disabled plane in tow. When Vedette reached her destination, she lowered a whaleboat which took up the tow and safely delivered the French plane. = End-of-war-operations = Vedette would never again have that much excitement in a single day. Thereafter, her duties for the remainder of the war were placid as she continued to escort convoys to and from Brest and patrolled offshore in between convoy runs. Less than a month after the Armistice with Germany stilled the guns of World War I on 11 November 1918, she departed Brest for the last time when she weighed anchor on 6 December 1918 for the long voyage home. Steaming in company with the patrol vessels , , , and Sultana, Vedette arrived at Ponta Delgada at 1025 on 11 December 1918. She coaled ship there, took on provisions, and brought aboard 133 bags of coal to store on deck for the transatlantic voyage. Underway at 0702 on 15 December 1918, the squadron anchored in St. George's harbor, Bermuda, on the morning of 24 December 1918. It got underway again on 25 December 1918 on the last leg of its voyage. Shortly after leaving Bermuda, Emeline, Nokomis, and Corona steamed off \\"on duty assigned,\\" leaving Vedette alone with Sultana—one of her companions on her voyage to Europe in the summer of 1917. The two patrol vessels entered New York Harbor on the afternoon of 28 December 1918, home at last.  Decommissioning and disposal  At 0900 on 30 December 1918, Vedette moved up the East River to the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn. By noon, her trio of 3-inch (76.2-mm) guns, her machine guns, and small arms had been removed. On 4 February 1919, at Tebo's Yacht Basin, Vedette was returned to Frederick W. Vanderbilt. She was stricken from the Navy List the same day.  See also  * U.S. Navy * World War I References * * USS Vedette (SP-163), 1917-1919.

On April 6, 2011, the band's website announced that all of the Zach brothers except David (Daniel, Philip and Paul Zach) would be leaving the band, to be replaced by Dave Mohr, Timmy Jones, and Corey Horn. The departure of the three brothers was heavily driven by feuding between the brothers, primarily between Philip and David, as well as Philip's declining singing ability following vocal surgery and scarring. The departure also marked the band's relocation to Nashville, Tennessee. Philip started his own recording studio in Lincoln, Nebraska, named the Grid Studio, and started his own solo act (Arrows and Sound). Philip collaborated with Paul Zach and local Lincoln musicians (The Silver Pages), and started a two-man project with musician Coury Palermo (A Thousand Fires). The departure of the three brothers marked the beginning of a three year, self-imposed silence between brothers, specifically between Philip and David. On May 2, 2011 they independently released Light Makes a Way EP. In 2012, they signed with Centricity Music and on August 18, 2012, they released Resuscitate. Drummer Timmy Jones left in 2013 to join For King and Country, and Nashville-based drummer Tim Buell stepped in. Tim left the band in 2015, which prompted appearances by Michael Sturd and Zach Hunter. Timmy rejoined Remedy Drive in 2016. Since 2014, the band's albums have been produced by former band member, Philip Zach at The Grid Studio in Lincoln, Nebraska. On August 23, 2014, they released Commodity. On September 2, 2016, they released Hope's Not Giving Up. The North Star was released on January 12, 2018. Philip Zach is listed in the liner notes as being part of the band, along with Timmy Jones on drums. =Daylight is Coming= The band signed on with Word Records in early 2008 after being an independent band for nearly ten years. Their first non-independent studio album, Daylight is Coming, was released on August 26, 2008 on Word Records. The album was produced by Ian Eskelin. Remedy Drive's first official single \\"Daylight\\" was released to Christian CHR radio stations on May 23, 2008. Lead singer David Zach said about the song: \\"In Lord of the Rings, Gandalf said, ‘At dawn, look to the East’, and that’s the message we’re offering here: even in the most desperate times, each new day provides a glimmer of hope.\\" On March 30, 2010, an Expanded Edition with three additional songs, and an EP with those three songs along with two remixes were released. The Remedy Drive song \\"Hope\\" was used for the Vancouver Olympic Games commercial in 2009 - 2010. In early 2010, Remedy Drive's official website said that the band was creating new songs for an upcoming project, possibly a second album for Word Records. In 2010, Remedy Drive toured with the Rock and Worship Roadshow with artists such as David Crowder Band, MercyMe, Family Force 5, Fee, and Sidewalk Prophets. =Light Makes A Way EP= On May 2, 2011, a five-song EP was released entitled Light Makes A Way. =Resuscitate= Remedy Drive signed with Centricity Music, and began working on their seventh studio album, entitled Resuscitate, which was released on September 18, 2012. On June 19, 2012, the band released their first single off the album, \\"Better Than Life,\\" along with a lyric music video. The album has had good reviews so far. The title song \\"Resuscitate\\" spent significant time at the top of Christian rock charts. =Commodity= In 2014, David Zach stated that Commodity would be a counter-trafficking album to fight for freedom. The album was inspired by David Zach's work with the Exodus Road and his undercover work in Southeast Asia to deliver impoverished youth from child slavery. The album also marked the first time David Zach had spoken to his brother Philip Zach in almost three years, who would also act as the producer and collaborator for the new album. This new album saw the band moving towards an independent path. Kickstarter was utilized to raise funding for the new album to reach listeners. Donations started on May 1 and the end of the donation period was May 31. The Commodity Kickstarter page was seeking $20,000 and the goal was surpassed and concluded having made $27,710. The first single was Commodity released on April 9 and it spent 16 weeks at number 1 on Christian rock radio. The album was released on September 23, 2014. In 2014 Dave Mohr left the band and was followed by Tim Buell in 2015. =Hope's Not Giving Up= Hope's Not Giving Up was released independently on September 2, 2016 and consisted of new recordings of alternate versions 10 of their songs. =The North Star= In 2017, the band started another Kickstarter campaign to raise $20,000 to produce a second counter-trafficking album. It was successful having raised $37,361. It was released on January 12, 2018.

She founded and led the Marie-Claire Line, helping Allied airmen and soldiers escape from Nazi-occupied France. The airmen were survivors of military airplanes shot down over occupied Europe. During the course of the war, Lindell was run over by an automobile, shot in the head, imprisoned twice, and captured and sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp. Her son Maurice was captured and tortured. Her son Octave (Oky), also captured, disappeared and presumably died in a German concentration camp. Outspoken, controversial and imperious, Lindell was called a \\"false heroine\\" by one critic, but she is credited with helping about 100 allied airmen escape from France. At Ravensbrück she was the self-appointed leader of the British and American women imprisoned in the camp and as a nurse helped some of them survive. She advocated successfully for the release of 47 American and British women to the Swedish Red Cross in the closing days of World War II. Lindell was awarded the Croix de Guerre twice, once for her work in World War I and once for World War II. Early life Lindell was born to a wealthy family in Surrey, England. Her mother, Gertrude Colls, was of the Colls family, the daughter of a successful architect.Peter Morley, Peter Morley - A Life Rewound Part 4 (PDF) British Academy of Film and Television Arts (2010), pp. 245-250. Retrieved September 29, 2011 During the First World War, she served as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and subsequently with the Secours aux Blessés, a division of the French Red Cross. She was decorated for her bravery and service by the French, receiving a Croix de Guerre in 1918. She was also decorated by the Tsarist Russian government. She married the Count Marie Joseph de Milleville , a member of the French aristocracy, and settled in Paris. The couple had three children: two boys, Maurice, (b. 1921) and Octave, and a daughter, Marie, whom she called Barbé. All were teenagers in 1940.Rossiter, Margaret L. (1986), Women in the Resistance, New York: Prager, p. 35Clutton-Brock, Oliver (2009), RAF Evaders, London: Grub Street, p. xv When Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940, Lindell and her children were living in a luxurious apartment in Paris. Her husband was on a business trip to South America.Hore, Peter (2016), Lindell's List: Saving British and American Women at Ravensbrück, Stroud, Gloucestershire: The History Press, p. 23 The Marie-Claire Line Vichy France is the \\"Free Zone\\" on this map. With the evacuation from Dunkirk and the surrender of France to Nazi Germany in 1940, many British soldiers and airmen were stranded in occupied Europe. In Paris, Lindell decided that she and her three children would help the soldiers and airmen escape occupied France to unoccupied Vichy France. Through a friend, she found a farm near Sauveterre-de-Béarn which straddled the boundary between occupied France and unoccupied France. Living in nearby Mauléon- Licharre was a retired British officer, Major William Higgins, who was willing to help British soldiers slip across the nearby border to safety in neutral Spain. Lindell, her children, and Michele Cambards, teenage girlfriend of her son Oky, began escorting soldiers and airmen by train from Paris to Sauveterre. Later she shifted operations to Ruffec, a more accessible location. The people she escorted across the border into Vichy France were subsequently helped to return to the United Kingdom by the Pat O'Leary escape line and the Seaman's mission of Donald Caskie in Marseille.Clutton-Brock, Oliver (2009), RAF Evaders, London: Grub Street, pp. 134-135 Lindell, her family, and her associates may have assisted about 25 English and 50 French men to escape capture by the Germans in 1940.Hore, Peter (2015), Lindell's List, p. 59 Stroud, Gloucestshire: The History Press, p. 59 However, her luck ran out in early 1941 when the Abwehr police arrested her in Paris and she was sentenced to 9 months in prison. At about the same time, her son Maurice was arrested and sentenced to 11 months in prison. After Lindell was released in November 1941, she returned to Ruffec and adopted the code names \\"Marie\\" and \\"Marie-Claire\\", thus the \\"Marie-Claire\\" line. Afraid of being rearrested, she soon crossed the border into Vichy France. George Whittington, an American Vice Consul in Lyon, France, obtained for Lindell an exit visa from Vichy, describing her as a \\"stranded English governess.\\" In July 1942, Lindell arrived safely in London.Rossiter, Margaret L. (1986), Women in the Resistance, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, pp. 37-38Clutton-Brock, p. 136 Return to France In London, Lindell received training from MI9 in clandestine techniques and returned to France via Westland Lysander airplane in October 1942, landing near Ussel, Corrèze. Based in Ruffec, she sat up operations of the Marie-Clair escape line once again. However, in December she was badly injured and nearly died when an automobile crashed into the bicycle she was riding. Ill, bandaged, and with her arm still in a sling, she assisted two of the best known escapees of World War II: Herbert Hasler and Bill Sparks, the \\"Cockleshell Heroes\\" and only survivors of Operation Frankton. Sparks commented that \\"seeing my commanding officer taking orders from a little lady was very humorous for me. But she left us in no doubt that she was the governor.\\"Hore, p.77-82, 86Clutton-Brock, p. 137 Misfortune, however, began to impact the flourishing operations of the Marie-Claire Line. In May 1943, Lindell's son and principal helper, Maurice, was arrested in Lyon and tortured. Her daughter Barbé (who was friends with many of the German occupiers of Paris) negotiated a bribe of 60,000 francs for Maurice's release with Klaus Barbie, the notorious Gestapo leader. Lindell's son Oky was arrested soon afterwards, sent to a prison camp, and never heard of again. With a price on her head and the Gestapo on her trail, Lindell adopted a new identity, the \\"Comtesse de Moncy.\\" She made enemies, refusing to accede to demands by a British intelligence officer that he be evacuated immediately, telling him \\"this is an escape route for airmen.\\" She also quarreled with one of her guides, Comtesse Pauline Barré de Saint-Venant, code named \\"Alice Laroche\\" and \\"Marie-Odile.\\" Pitchfork, Graham (2003), Shot down and on the Run, Toronto: The Dundurn Group, p. 68Hore, 97-100, 111-112 As a result of the row with Saint-Venant, Lindell moved her operation from Ruffec to Pau, a city near the border of Spain.Rossiter, p. 41-42 Although statistics are incomplete, the Marie-Claire line is credited with helping about 100 allied airmen escape from occupied France.Hore, pp. 101-104 Captured and imprisoned On November 22, 1943, Lindell was arrested at the train station in Pau. She was wearing, as usual, her Red Cross uniform and was awaiting the arrival by train of four airmen whom she planned to send with a guide across the nearby Pyrenees to Spain. In December, Lindell was sent by train to Paris. She attempted to escape by jumping off the train and was shot in the head by a German guard. Taken to a Luftwaffe hospital in Tours a German surgeon operated on her and saved her life.Rossiter, pp. 42 Taken to Dijon in January 1944, she was held, chained and in solitary confinement. However unlike many captives of the Germans she was not tortured. Ravensbrück In August 1944, with the liberation of France by allied forces underway, Lindell and three other women were transported to Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, arriving there on September 3, 1944.Clutton-Brock, pp. 147-148 Two weeks after arriving at Ravensbrück, Lindell was assigned to work in the camp hospital as a nurse. Thus, although working 12 to 14 hours a day, she avoided the grueling labor assigned to most of the women in the prison camp. The doctor in charge of the hospital was SS officer Percy Triete who had an English mother. Lindell said that Triete \\"behaved very well to me and did all he could for my [English] compatriots.\\"Hore, pp 149-150 British and American women in Ravensbrück numbered only a few among the tens of thousands of women prisoners, of whom the largest contingent were Poles. From her job at the hospital, Lindell had the opportunity to meet or hear of many of the British and American women and made a list of those imprisoned at Ravensbrück.\\"Ravensbrueck,\\" Holocaust Encyclopedia, , accessed 4 Dec 2020Hore, p. 23 In 1945, during the closing months of World War II, a Swedish diplomat, Folke Bernadotte, negotiated with the German government for the release of women prisoners from Ravensbrück and other concentration camps. Hundreds of white buses (painted white to distinguish them from military vehicles and thereby avoid bombing by the allied airforces), were assembled to collect and transport some prisoners, especially Scandinavians, from the concentration camps to Padborg, Denmark from where the prisoners could travel by sea to neutral Sweden.Heit, Judi, \\"Heroines of the Resistance,\\" , accessed 3 Dec 2019 The Germans initially denied to Bernadotte that any British or American women were in Ravensbrück. They were to be held as hostages to be exchanged for captured German officers. Lindell, ill from pneumonia, claimed that she rose from her hospital bed and confronted the camp commander, SS officer Johann Schwarzhuber. She presented him with her list of 47 prisoners of British and American citizenship or heritage and he acceded to her demand to allow them to leave the camp on the white buses. However, the drama for Lindell was not quite over. As the other women were boarding the white buses, Schwarzhuber told Lindell that she could not go. Percy Triete intervened on her behalf and escorted her onto the last bus to leave Ravensbrück, April 25, 1945, two weeks before Germany surrendered.Hore, pp. 215-218. 243-246 Lindell, in her nursing uniform, was identified in Swedish news film showing her directing her fellow liberated inmates. Ravensbrück trials After the war, 38 Germans who worked at Ravensbrück were charged with war crimes. Twenty-one of those charged were women. At the Ravensbrück Trial, Percy Treite, the half-English medical doctor at Ravensbrück, was among those charged. A dozen former female prisoners, including Lindell, wrote letters to the court favorable to Triete. Lindell testified in favor of Treite at the trial saying that Treite \\"was the only man who was human, the only man who looked after the sick people as a doctor should look after them.\\" She also criticized the judge advocate, \\"who was partial and objectionable, had taken on the cross examination of witnesses himself and prevented other questions from being put which might have been [answered] in favour of the accused.\\"Hore, p. 235 SS officer Percy Treite was sentenced to death. He committed suicide in prison on 8 April 1947. Le Foulon's research In 2015, Marie-Laure Le Foulon published an account of her research on Lindell based on the work of Corinna von List and information provided by Anise Postel-Vienay, both members of the French Resistance.Marie- Laure Le Foulon, Lady mensonges, Mary Lindell, fausse héroïne de la Résistance, Paris, Alma Éditeur (2015); Lindell was accused of being SS officer Percy Treite's lover. He was 33 years old in 1945; she was 49 years old. Allegations that she was a \\"double agent\\" were debunked by Lindell's biographer and historian Peter Hore.\\"Ask the Author: Peter Hore on Forgotten WWII Hero, Mary Lindell,\\" https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/ask-the- author-peter-hore-on-forgotten-wwii-hero-mary-lindell/, accessed 20 Nov 2019Hore, p. 241 In a television interview, Hore called the allegation that Lindell was a German agent \\"complete nonsense.\\", accessed 29 Nov 2019 The French Resistance was riddled with rivalries and back-biting. Hore commented that Lindell resisted the German occupation of France for more than four years unlike many of her critics who joined the resistance only when it became clear that Germany was losing the war.Hore, p.11 Film and television The 1991 film One Against the Wind starred Judy Davis, and was based on the biography Story of Mary Lindell: Wartime Secret Agent by Barry Wynne. Lindell was featured in Women of Courage, a television series about four women who defied the Nazis, produced by Peter Morley, himself a German Jewish refugee. The other women were Maria Rutkiewicz, a Polish woman; Sigrid Helliesen Lund, a Norwegian; and Hiltgunt Zassenhaus, a German.

It represents the Late Cretaceous to Eocene accretion of what is known as the Insular Superterrane (formed from repeated accretion of multiple terranes) to the North American continent. The rocks that form the Insular Superterrane are allochthonous, meaning they are not related to the rest of the North American continent. They consist of a series of volcanics, intrusions and sedimentary rocks from the collision of an ancient island arc called the Insular Islands.The Coast Range Episode (115 to 57 million years ago) The exact collision of the Insular Islands remains uncertain. The major island groups that compose the Insular Superterrane are, from south to north, Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska. The region is noteworthy as it has the greatest physiographic relief from the depths of Queen Charlotte Sound (which had been a coastal plain during the last ice age) to the heights of the Wrangell - Saint Elias Mountains. In general the region is extremely rugged with very little flat land except in certain regions (e.g. the east coast of Vancouver Island).

At first developed for the company's own game Hero's Journey, the engine won multiple awards at tradeshows, and has since been licensed by other companies such as BioWare Austin (which is using it for Star Wars: The Old Republic) and Stray Bullet Games (for an as yet unnamed project). On June 12, 2010, Idea Fabrik announced that it had purchased \\"the HeroEngine and HeroCloud game development technologies\\" as well as hired \\"the staff of Simutronics that was associated with the development and support of HeroEngine/HeroCloud\\". Features The engine has online creation. For example, one developer can be creating a house and the entities inside, while another works on the landscaping and terrain around it. Each sees the other's work in real time. The simulation and rendering processes of the engine are currently run on a single-thread. However, it is planned for there to be a multi-threaded release, but the publish date has not yet been determined., official forum, \\"In the current release, simulation and rendering run on a single shared core.\\" Development times vary between games. Faxion Online took 18 months to complete,HE-Cooper Administrator, official forum, \\"Faxion's Development cycle was around 18 months. Which, luckily for us, is exactly what the HeroEngine is supposed to do.\\" and Star Wars: The Old Republic took over five years. =Integration with other technologies= HeroBlade contains integrated features such as custom scripting and collaborative project management, which allow developers to make notes directly onto the in-game levels for others to see. These notes can be attached to tasks to signal other developers that something specific needs to be worked on. HeroEngine also works with technology from third-party vendors, such as FMOD, PhysX, SpeedTree, Wwise, Scaleform, and Vivox, as well as having plugins for 3D Studio Max and Maya. HeroCloud HeroCloud is a version of HeroEngine that is available for $99 per year, under the license that they receive 30% the money sales of any game made with it.

It is open daily except Tuesday; an admission fee is charged. History The museum is located in painter Eugène Delacroix's last apartment; he moved to this location on December 28, 1857, and remained until his death on August 13, 1863. In 1929, the Société des Amis d'Eugène Delacroix was formed to prevent the building's destruction; in 1952, the Société acquired the apartment, studio, and garden, and in 1954 donated the property to the French government. In 1971, the site became a national museum, and in 1999 its garden was renovated. Léon Printemps had his studio in this same building, where he died on 9 July 1945. Collection Today the museum contains Delacroix's memorabilia and works, exhibiting pictures from nearly every phase of his career, including the artist's only three attempts at fresco from Valmont (1834); the Education of the Virgin painted in Nohant in 1842; and Magdalene in the Desert exhibited at the 1845 Salon. It also contains: * Drawings, primarily studies for paintings in the Chapelle des Saints-Anges at the Église Saint-Sulpice, but also drawings by some of Delacroix's friends and colleagues (Lassalle-Bordes, Huet, Poterlet, Saint-Marcel, Colin). * Notes, sketches, and souvenirs for Delacroix's Morocco trip in 1832, including burnooses, haiks, caftans, djellabas, jewelry, sabers, cushions, slippers, boots, and ceramics. * Studio items, including easel, palettes, painting tables, a glass he used for washing up, a small group of decorated faiences, and a pair of candlesticks. * Photographs of Delacroix toward the end of his life, and letters to and from Delacroix. * A library and documents concerning Delacroix and entourage, with more than 1,000 works (monographs, exhibition catalogues, research, etc.).

It is located on Amberd River. The modern settlement was founded in 1919 by emigrants from Van and Bitlis. Archaeology The archaeological site of Agarak is located south of the highway on the west side of the Amberd Canyon. A dirt road leads from the village sign to the south on the mound. The site contains some of the oldest large man-made structures carved into stone, dating to the Early Bronze Age ('Agarak 1' dated 3400 BC). This is the earliest in the Caucasus. Rock wells, rock-cut stairways, corridors, and horseshoe-shaped structures are found. The Early Bronze Age culture area covers 200 hectares, of which 118 hectares were declared a protected zone. In the early Bronze Age, here already existed a town with a regular street plan.Ancient settlement of Agarak A possible ancient astronomical observatory is found here. The Early Bronze Age site is surrounded by walls; they are up to one meter thick and were made of sun-dried mud-brick. Rock structures from Agarak A large quantity of potsherds, as well as many round portable clay fireplaces, represent the Kura- Araxes culture; they are dated to 29th-27th century BC, and are similar to Shengavit type pottery. The findings show a continuous settlement up to the end of the early Iron Age (9th century), and then to the fall of the Urartian Empire in the 6th century BC. In 4th century BC, Agarak became an urban center due to its location on the Aras Valley trade route. This is demonstrated by the discovery in burials of coins, as well as of signet rings from the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Based on some potsherd finds, Agarak was a village-level settlement in the early Middle Ages. There was also some sparse occupation during the 17th-18th centuries.

The most remarkable features of Bayou Bacchanal are the masqueraders who dance through the city streets to the pulsating beats of steel drums, which are indigenous instruments of Trinidad and Tobago. Moreover, Bayou Bacchanal, like other Caribbean festivals, encourages full participation for visitors in the parade who normally dress in exotic-islander costumes, but it is not required. Anyone may join the parade as it snakes its way to Lafayette Square to finish the festival with concerts, authentic Caribbean cuisine, arts and crafts. Bayou Bacchanal is only one stop for the festival lovers. Throughout the year, party goers will follow the Caribbean party to cities all over North America. For example, a group of people may participate in the Caribbean festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, drive to Atlanta, Georgia for another, afterward leave to Miami, Florida's event and then make a final stop in New Orleans, Louisiana for the Bayou Bacchanal. Every year almost every major city in North America holds a Caribbean festival.
