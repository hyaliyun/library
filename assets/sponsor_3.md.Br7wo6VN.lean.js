Textual basis The EOB is an Orthodox translation of the Bible. Unlike other versions, the EOB provides over 200 pages of introductory material and appendices, including articles by the late Protopresbyter George Florovsky and Miltiades Konstantinou of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The main purpose of the EOB is to provide an accurate and easy-to-read English text of the Bible that is suitable for use by Orthodox Christian communities and individuals, while providing an outstanding text for scholars. The Old Testament would have been based on the Greek text of the Old Testament Septuagint with all major Masoretic and Dead Sea Scroll variants documented in the footnotes. For reasons documented in the comprehensive introductory section, the EOB also would have provided the Hebrew/Masoretic versions of Job, Jeremiah and Esther. The New Testament (completed and available) is based on the official ecclesiastical text published in 1904 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (again documenting all significant variants to the Critical Text, Majority Text and Textus Receptus). It also provides extensive footnotes and appendices dealing with significant verses such as Matthew 16:18; John 1:1,18; John 15:26. The Patriarchal Text was selected on Mount Athos from among a large number of reliable ecclesiastical manuscripts and appears to be identical or similar to Minuscule 1495 (KR subgroup). Because it is controlled and updated within the Orthodox community, it is independent from non-Orthodox commercial publishers and can benefit from constant input from Eastern Orthodox scholars and theologians.

This brown is widespread in south-eastern and northern Europe. It prefers mixed woodlands at low altitudes. It is rarely seen on open areas. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, and the type locality is Sweden. Description The Arran brown is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of between . Females tend to be a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark greyish brown with a reddish-orange strip near the margin along which runs a series of black spots. Many of the spots are small but some have white centres. The underside of the forewing is dark brown with a reddish strip with black, white-centred eyespots near the outer edge. The underside of the hindwing is brown, edged with a row of more or less distinct dark coloured eyespots. The basal side of these is close to the centre of wing and there are one or two patches of white. The basal part of the hindwing of the female is a darker brown than the rest of the wing. This butterfly can be distinguished from the rather similar Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the Arctic ringlet (Erebia disa) by the fact that it has white blotches on the under surfaces of the hindwing and those butterflies do not. It can also be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet by the fact that it always has eyespots on its hindwings while the upperside of the Arctic ringlet's wings are plain brown. Another very similar species is the dewy ringlet, but that has a more rusty red forewing and the red strip along the underside of the wings is not continuous. It is questionable whether this butterfly occurs in the British Isles but historical collections of the Scotch argus (Erebia aethiops) contain some specimens of Arran brown among the very similar specimens of Scottish argus. The original record is from the Isle of Arran, in the Clyde Isles in Scotland, in 1803, and it is from this that the butterfly gets its English name. Distribution and habitat The Arran brown is native to northern and south-eastern Europe. It is found in July and August on grassland, open woodland, forest clearings and the margins of forests.

Plot The film opens with a map of the Timor Sea area, showing Timor Island, then Japanese occupied Dutch Timor and Portuguese Timor (East Timor), in relation to the coast of the Northern Territory in northern Australia. It briefly explains the circumstances of the Australian troops left behind, who did not surrender but carried on a guerrilla war against the Japanese. After some very difficult forays behind enemy lines to capture equipment for radio, they manage to contact the Australian military in the city of Darwin across the Timor Sea. Wary of a possible Japanese trick, the military asked the Sparrow Force men what the first name of a wife of a particular sergeant was. When the correct answer, Joan, was returned, the Australian military starts to airlift supplies to the Allied guerrillas and their Timorese allies. Production Damien Parer, British journalist Dixon-Brown and ABC war correspondent Bill Marien travelled to Timor in November 1942 to report on the conflict. The Australian soldiers delayed an attack until Parer's arrival so he could film it.\\"Men of Timor\\" at WW2 Australia Embarked from Darwin in HMAS Castlemaine, a corvette for Betano on 5 November 1942 and returned embarking at Belano in Timor for Darwin, Australia on 16 November 1942.

It was a twin-engine aircraft with a fuselage derived from the single-engine Curtiss Thrush. The Kingbird had two engine nacelles mounted on the struts on either side of the fuselage that braced the wing and the outrigger undercarriage. A distinctive design feature was the aircraft's blunt nose, located behind the propeller arcs. This allowed the engines to be mounted closer to each other and to the aircraft's centerline, therefore minimising asymmetrical thrust in case of an engine failure. For the same reason, the Thrush's single tailfin was replaced by twin tails on the Kingbird, and the main production model, the D-2 fitted a second horizontal stabilizer and elevator between these fins. Eastern Air Transport was to be the Kingbird's main operator, flying 14 of them for a few years. The United States Marine Corps also purchased an example, first designating it JC-1, then RC-1 and using it as an air ambulance.

In October 2008, it was announced that the film was Lithuania's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the 81st Academy Awards, becoming the first Lithuanian feature film ever to be submitted for the Academy Awards. Awards The international premiere of Loss was held in 2008 Shanghai International Film Festival, where it was awarded with 2 Jin Jue (Golden Goblet) awards: Best Director for MƒÅris Martinsons and Best Music for Andrius Mamontovas. It is the first Lithuanian feature film to be screened in the competition of an A class festival and awarded prestigious prizes. In 2009 Loss was awarded with the Lielais Kristaps award, Latvia's highest prize awarded in cinema. Synopsis Loss is a story about a Priest (starring Andrius Mamontovas) in Ireland who meets a woman Valda (starring Valda Biƒçkutƒó) from his native Lithuania only to find out her mysterious identity is closely connected with a darkest secret of his past. Desperate for a better life Valda left Lithuania for Ireland, hoping to find a new purpose in life but failed to fulfill a promise to come back she made to her alleged son. Now a boy is adopted by Nora (starring Dalia Micheleviƒçi≈´tƒó), a childless ex-wife of the desperate businessman Ben (starring Kostas Smoriginas) whose life is falling from his hands. Caught in a struggle with her husband‚Äôs mistress Laima (starring Daiva Tamo≈°i≈´naitƒó-Budrƒó) she must fight not only for her company but also for the custody of a child who now is her only hope in life. According to Variety magazine film critic Eddie Cockrell, the satisfying Lithuanian drama was inspired by Six Degrees of Separation and Dostoevsky‚Äôs line ‚Äúthe tears of that one tortured child‚Äù. Loss delves into the harsh realities of six people‚Äôs lives whose destinies are brought together after a tragic accident that happened over two decades ago. Style The film is shot entirely on a hand-held camera. The camera's swift movements follow the heroes of the film creating a feeling of closeness to the film‚Äôs characters and allowing the audience to permeate into their hearts. To deepen the feelings even more, the director decided to shoot the film on a 16 mm film so that during its transfer onto 35 mm the display became grainy, intentionally contributing a special kind of atmosphere to the film. The haunting music score is reminiscent of Irish folk rhythms. Production Loss has been shot in Lithuania and Ireland. The exterior scenes were shot in Wicklow town, Powerscourt Waterfall, etc. Box office Total box office of this film from exhibition Lithuania is 594 763 Lt.

Between 1917 and 1918 Teale took up a research fellowship at the University of Melbourne. After the war Teale returned to East Africa as part of the geological survey until 1936. Thiele/Teale also did some work in New Zealand with Albert Ernest Kitson and later helped Kitson discover the first diamonds in the Gold Coast. Personal life He was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1874. He was married to Charlotte Wilhelmina Stalker in 1909. They had two children, Margaret and Ronald. Edmund and Charlotte lived in Pirbright, England in their later years. Edmund died in 1971 leaving Charlotte a widow. Their son, Ronald Edmund Littlewood Teale, went on to become a missionary with his wife, who was also called, Margaret, in Papua New Guinea for 60 years. Ronald and Margaret have two daughters Esther Ingram and Ruth Clark as well as five grandchildren and ten great grandchildren. Selected publications * Leonard Darwin, Tempest Anderson, A. E.

Knopf) When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor (1996) is a book by William Julius Wilson, Professor of Social Policy at Harvard. Wilson's argument is that the disappearance of work and the consequences of that disappearance for both social and cultural life are the central problems in the inner-city ghetto. He sought to discuss social disorganization without stigmatizing the poor.When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor. - book reviews by Daryl Michael Scott Wilson writes that chronic joblessness has deprived those in the inner city of skills necessary to obtain and keep jobs. Wilson's book uses evidence from large- scale scientific surveys in the ghetto and information culled from ethnographic interviews of ghetto residents in order to create a complete picture of the problems that face the residents.When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor. - book reviews Washington Monthly, Nov, 1996 by David Whitman Wilson writes that people who inhabit the disorganized, jobless ghettos face dim prospects. Poor public transportation often fails to provide access to job locations, stereotypes about poor blacks, especially black men also make jobs harder to find. Wilson rejects the idea that inner-city residents have a \\"culture of poverty\\" or damaged personalities. He holds that addressing the problem of joblessness is the solution to urban inner-city problems.

Systematics, taxonomy and evolution The Swiss brassy ringlet belongs to the brassy ringlet group of its genus Erebia. These are found in taiga and alpine habitat across Eurasia, with one population in comparatively recent times colonizing North America. The brassy ringlet group, like many Erebia, has a complicated taxonomy, with scores of \\"variants\\" having been named in the late 19th and early 20th century. Most of these in fact were simply aberrations, local or seasonal forms. As this was realized, the brassy ringlets of the Alps and Pyrenees were united in E. tyndarus, either as a superspecies or as a species. In recent times, this question has been restudied, including the DNA sequence data available nowadays. The view that only a single species of this non-migratory butterfly with restricted habitat preferences occurs in far-flung localities like the Sierra Nevada of southern Spain or the Julian Alps of Slovenia is generally considered obsolete. Rather, it seems that quite a few proper species are involved. The Swiss brassy ringlet in particular is part of a cryptic species complex from the Alps. These diverged at the end of the Riss/Saale glaciation roughly 130,000 years ago, when the available habitat shifted up the mountains. The ancestors of the Alpine brassy ringlets had lived in the lowlands when the Alps were entirely covered by ice, and as the ice retreated, their typical habitat moved upwards, and the butterflies with them. Thus, populations became isolated in different mountain ranges and with gene flow between them restricted started to evolve into distinct species. The brassy ringlets from the Alps, the closest relatives of E. tyndarus, consist of three further species: * Erebia nivalis, or de Lesse's brassy ringlet, found in the highest regions of the Central Eastern Alps of Austria * Erebia calcaria, or Lorkovic's brassy ringlet, from the Julian Alps which straddle the borders of Austria, Italy and Slovenia * Erebia cassioides, or the common brassy ringlet, which occurs on meadows somewhat further downhill than the other species and consequently is widely distributed in the rest of the Alps. The last is presumably closest to the last common ancestors of the Alpine brassy ringlets. Description and ecology Langham and Wheeler collection in the Ulster Museum. Note the silvery hindwing underside in the second row from the left. The left two rows are typical specimens; the right two rows are developmental variants (not subspecies). This mid-sized member of the genus Erebia has a wingspan around 35 mm. It has the blackish-brown upperwings typical of this genus. It also has the brassy sheen or green-gold lustre on the forewings (hence the common English name). These colours are caused by interference of the light on the wing scales. The upper forewings, and sometimes the upper hindwings also, bear an extensive coppery or orange patch, near the tip in the former and running parallel to the outer margin in the latter. In this patch there are black eyespots with a white dot in the middle, two immediately next to each other in the forewings and three or four more evenly spaced ones in the hindwings. These small spots do not touch each other.Butterfly guide However, the hindwing spots may be reduced or entirely absent, particularly in the males which also have a darker coloration overall. The underwings are cryptically coloured in lighter greyish brown. A darker band arches between the forward and back margins of the hindwing, which has a prominent silvery sheen also found in closely related species of Erebia and conspicuous at a distance when these butterflies fly around in the sun. The reddish patches and the eyespots of the forewing also occur on the underwings, those of the hindwings usually do not. The adults fly only for a brief time during summer, mainly in July and August, feeding on nectar of the preferred yellow mountain flowers. The eggs are green, oval and show many longitudinal ribs. The caterpillars are grey-green to grey-brown, with dark longitudinal lines. The pupa is thick and brown coloured. The Swiss brassy ringlet is univoltine and its caterpillars feed on Poaceae grasses, especially sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), matgrass (Nardus stricta), and various other fescues (Festuca) and meadow-grasses (Poa). They overwinter and pupate on the ground around May and June. Distribution This species can be found in the Alps of France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, in Austrian Vorarlberg, and adjacent regions.\\"Erebia Dalman, 1816\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life FormsFauna Europaea Habitat This species can be found above the treeline, in clearings and rocky alpine meadows, at an altitude of .Guide des papillons d'Europe et d'Afrique du Nord de Tom Tolman, Richard Lewington,, √©ditions Delachaux et Niestl√©, 1998 ReferencesExternal links *Euro butterflies *Papillons du Poitou-Charentes *Lepiforum Category:Erebia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies described in 1781 ","title":"Erebia tyndarus"},{"id":"15046834","text":"State Road 504 (SR 504), also known as the Flatbush Avenue Connector, is a highway in Connecticut that runs within the city of Hartford. Its southern terminus is an intersection with Flatbush Avenue and the northern terminus is the interchange with Interstate 84 (I-84) and US Highway 6 (US 6) at exit 45\\\\. The entire length of SR 504 is a two-lane freeway. Route description The Flatbush Avenue Connector starts at an intersection with Flatbush Avenue. The roadway runs northward alongside a creek as a limited-access highway. After through wooded suburban surroundings, the single northbound lane merges into eastbound I-84/US 6. History SR 504 was once planned to be a short freeway to connect with the Berlin Turnpike (U.S. Route 5 and Route 15) near the South Meadows Expressway connector. This was once planned as part of the old planned Route 9 freeway (renumbered to the planned Route 189 freeway in 1963). Route 9 was moved westward and Route 189 never made it south from north side of Hartford. In 1963, however, the state proposed the corridor as the Cedar Ridge Connector with no number, leading from its current terminus at I-84 to U.S. 5/Route 15 in Wethersfield. The short expressway planned to include an interchange with a planned but cancelled Route 71 expressway leading to New Britain. Circa 2015, the viaduct carrying the northbound ramp to Eastbound I-84 was removed, and a new alignment adjacent to the southbound off ramp from Westbound I-84 was built. Future Exit 45 is currently an incomplete interchange, with ramps only for I-84 westbound to SR 504 (left exit) and Route 504 onto I-84 eastbound. The latest plans for the region include completing the interchange, providing access to points west, and moving a ramp to eliminate the left exit. Instead of creating a fully directional interchange, the state might build a diamond interchange or variant, and possibly open up surface access from the north.

The film, which was directed by Jack Cardiff, is based on Wilbur Smith's 1965 novel, The Dark of the Sun. The story about a band of mercenaries sent on a dangerous mission during the Congo Crisis was adapted into a screenplay by Ranald MacDougall. Critics condemned the film on its original release for its graphic scenes of violence and torture. Plot In the mid-1960s, mercenary Bruce Curry is publicly hired by Congolese President Ubi to rescue European residents from an isolated mining town about to be attacked by rebel Simbas in the Congo. However, his real mission is to retrieve $50 million of diamonds from a mine company's vault. Ubi insists the operation must be completed in three days, as the money is needed to pay off loans from foreign banks that are about to be delinquent. Curry's subordinates include his friend Ruffo and alcoholic Doctor Wreid. He also reluctantly recruits ex-Nazi Henlein because he needs his military expertise and leadership skills. Ubi gives Curry a steam train and Congolese government soldiers commanded by Henlein. However, as the mission is in violation of UN accords, the train is fired upon and damaged by a United Nations peacekeeping plane. At a burned-out farmhouse, they pick up a traumatised woman named Claire, who watched her husband, a mine company representative, being hacked to death by Simbas. Tension begins to develop between Henlein, who is aware of the diamons, and Curry, whose leadership Henlein resents. At a train junction, Henlein casually kills two children for being possible Simba spies, and later makes advances towards Claire. When confronted by Curry, the German attacks with a swagger stick and then a chainsaw. Curry overpowers Henlein and nearly crushes his head under a train wheel before Ruffo stops him. Further complications arise when the mercenaries reach the mining town. First, the diamonds are in a time-locked vault delaying the train's departure. Second, Dr. Wreid insists he can't abandon a pregnant woman at a nearby mission hospital. Reluctantly, Curry agrees to let the doctor stay behind. As Curry waits anxiously for the vault to open, the Simbas arrive and begin attacking the town and station. Eventually, the train, loaded with the diamonds and residents, slowly leaves under small arms fire. However, just as it crosses a river viaduct, a mortar round destroys the coupling between the last two carriages. The last coach - carrying the diamonds and most of the Europeans - is left to roll back into the Simba-held town as the rest of the train steams away. Curry and Ruffo set out to retrieve the diamonds from the rebels at nightfall. Using a Simba disguise, Ruffo carries Curry's lifeless body into the town's hotel where harrowing scenes (for the film's time period) include murder, torture and male rape. A diversionary attack by the surviving Congolese soldiers gives them the opportunity to get the diamonds and escape in vehicles. They return to the mission hospital to find Wreid and the missionaries dead. When they run low on fuel, Curry goes alone to the train junction to request an airdrop. Henlein uses his absence to kill Ruffo in the mistaken belief that he has the diamonds. When Curry returns to find his friend dead, he pursues Henlein in a murderous rage and kills him after a vicious fight. As the convoy continues, with his job done, Curry reflects on the type of man he is before turning himself in for a court- martial to answer for his actions. Cast * Rod Taylor as Capt.

Novel The script is based on the second published novel by Wilbur Smith.The Dark of the Sun at Wilbur Smith's novels Both the book and the film are a fictional account of the Congo Crisis (1960-1966), when Joseph Mobutu seized power during the First Republic of the Congo after national independence from Belgium.

The German version also cuts the scene where Henlein murders two Congolese children and is misleadingly entitled Katanga, implying the film takes place during the first Congo emergency in 1961‚Äì64, when mercenaries like M√ºller and 'Mad' Mike Hoare were involved. The movie was released in France as Last Train from Katanga (). =Soundtrack= Jacques Loussier, a French jazz pianist wrote the film's memorable progressive score. It was initially released by MGM Records in 1968; a re-release with bonus tracks was made available in 2008. Reception It was the 49th most popular movie of the year in France. The film was considered extremely violent for its time showing scenes of civilians being raped and tortured by Simbas. One contemporary reviewer was moved to comment that the director's main objective appeared to be to pack as much sadistic violence into the film's two hours as he could. On the subject of violence director Jack Cardiff commented: \\"Although it was a very violent story, the actual violence happening in the Congo at that time was much more than I could show in my film; in my research I encountered evidence so revolting I was nauseated. The critics complained of the violent content, but today it would hardly raise an eyebrow.\\" =Cult= Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino are two of the film's fans. Scorsese calls the film one of his \\"guilty pleasures\\". He elaborated: > This movie-Rod Taylor vs. the Mau Maus-was the most violent I'd seen up to > that time. There's a scene where Taylor fights an ex-Nazi with chain saws. > In another scene, a train full of refugees has finally escaped the Mau Maus > in the valley below-and just as it's about to reach the top of a hill, the > power fails, the train goes all the way back down, and the refugees are > slaughtered. It's a truly sadistic movie, but it should be seen. I'd guess > that because of its utter racism, a lot of people would have found it > embarrassing, so they just ignored it. The sense of the film is > overwhelmingly violent; there's no consideration for anything else. The > answer to everything is \\"kill.\\" The film was a particular influence on Tarantino, who used several tracks from the score for his movie Inglourious Basterds, which features Rod Taylor in a guest role as Winston Churchill.

It was released on March 16, 2007. A 7 episode series was later produced, telling what happens after the initial movie. The series was called Class: Life After (, which can also be translated as \\"Class: For Life\\"). Plot Joosep Raak (P√§rt Uusberg) is an Estonian teenager who is being bullied by his entire high school class, the ring leader of them all is Anders (Lauri Pedaja), his accomplice Paul (Mikk M√§gi) and three other friends Toomas (Joonas Paas), Tiit (Virgo Ernits) and Olav (Karl Sakrits). Anders encourages the class to continually beat up Joosep, and harass him in other ways as well, such as fully undressing him and then pushing him in the girls' changing room. However classmate Kaspar Kordes (Vallo Kirs) decides to go into a matter of loyalty by going against Anders and the others' entertainment of harassing Joosep by defending him, such as giving him a spare pair of shoes when Paul had torn them, which does not sit well with the whole class and so Kaspar becomes separated from the whole group the class had formed. Kaspar's love interest Thea (Paula Solvak) becomes distant to him and this begins to worry him but continues to defend Joosep. Joosep's tutor Laine (Laine M√§gi) becomes aware of Joosep receiving harassment and sends Paul to the headmistresses office and so he frames Kaspar of the whole harassment where they believe in him due to being unaware of his true actions, which leads to the school contacting Joosep's parents. Joosep's Father Margus (Margus Prangel) a militarist fascinated with guns and insists on Joosep being a \\"real man\\" encounters him about the accusation of Kaspar bullying him and so Joosep dismissively reveals that is the whole class which angers Margus and tells Joosep to fight the ringleader of the crowd as he believes it is the only way to stop and scare somebody from bullying him. The next day when Anders and his four friends go to attack Joosep, the restrained Kaspar breaks free and attempts to hit Anders with a chair, which Anders manages to dodge. Anders then claims that Kaspar has \\"gone crazy\\". Anders asks Kaspar to meet him in the school playground after class. Upon meeting up with an expected fight, Kaspar tells Anders that he will accept the fact that he will not be a \\"normal guy\\", where then Paul, Toomas, Tiit and Olav appear with a restrained Joosep and lock Kaspar in a burned down shed where they force him to watch as they take turns to hit Joosep, to the point where he can't breathe anymore. Before leaving off Anders tells Kaspar that if he continues to defend Joosep then it will only earn Joosep worser beatings. Joosep goes to Kaspar's apartment complex where they meet up and he informs Kaspar that he wishes for him to stop defending him, a concerned Kaspar asks what Joosep will do and suggests that he could shoot them by referencing a God's law, Joosep believes that it will be best if he simply let's it go on until he has completely finished school so he will never see them again and be free. Thea becomes saddened and angered when the class starts believing that in a homophobic atmosphere Joosep and Kaspar are ridiculed for supposedly having gay feelings for each other and so she is having love interests in Kaspar. Kaspar becomes stressed by this and tries to talk Thea down about it but she starts believing that Kaspar cares more about Joosep then her and leaves him, meanwhile Joosep is being beaten in class. When returning home, Joosep's Mother Liina (Tiina Rebane) discovers heavy bruises on his chest as well as a cut on his chin, she then becomes heavily worried that he had been fighting and demands to know what is happening but he refuses to tell and Margus supports him on the claim. Liina informs the school administration and at last the class as a whole is rightly blamed. When Laine confronts the class about the claim, Joosep runs home fearing the worst and angered, upon entering his home crying only to encounter Margus who learns that Liina called the school, tries to encourage his son to fight back and demonstrates a fighting technique by giving the boy an additional punch. Out of revenge, the class assembles on a beach, calling both Kaspar and Joosep there by writing emails to them showing each other as fake sender. Once there, they make Thea confess to Kaspar that she is no longer with him in front of the whole crowd which sets him off and beats Anders to the ground only to have a knife pulled on him, they all then force Kaspar to fellate Joosep at knife point and photograph the sexual act without showing the knife. Kaspar throws up afterwards. The boys decide to avenge themselves. Joosep steals Margus's two pistols, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition from his gun safe whilst asleep, and the two proceed to school the next morning. As they proceed, students and teachers notice the guns in their hands, when a teacher encounters them about it they simply walk past and Joosep tells her to call the police. Before entering the cafeteria to shoot their bullies, Kerli (Triin Tenso), a gothic girl from the class who also witnessed the incident at the beach, decides to let the two have their revenge and goes past them. They begin the massacre on the students responsible for their torment. Joosep shoots Tiit at close range and then shoots Olav in the head. Joosep then shoots and kills Thea's best friend Riina (Riina Ries). To their regret, Kaspar accidentally shoots an eighth grade female student from another class while trying to shoot Anders. Toomas tries to grab the gun from Joosep but ends up getting shot in the abdomen, then Anders and Paul manage to restrain him and take his rifle, however Kaspar saves Joosep by shooting Paul in the head, just before Anders could reach the exit and escape he is shot in the shoulder and is executed by Joosep. Joosep then goes over to finish off Thea but Kaspar stops him and decides to spare her. Finally Joosep and Kaspar, facing one another, each aim a gun at their own head, decide to commit suicide together after counting to three. Joosep pulls the trigger and dies, but the film ends with Kaspar still standing there with his gun aiming at his head.

The restaurant opened in June 1962, located just inside the Adventureland gates. It was Disneyland's first dinner theater, with entertainment provided by the Polynesian Revue, a music-and-dance show featuring dance troupe the Royal Tahitians, hula dancers and a fire walker. The restaurant was originally sponsored by Stouffer's frozen food; in the 1980s, Kikkoman was the sponsor. The restaurant was actually the back half of the hub's Plaza Pavilion restaurant, which originally had a Hawaiian-themed patio that looked out over the Jungle Cruise waterway. The same kitchen was used for both the Plaza Pavilion and the Tahitian Terrace. Served at outdoor tables, guests could sample exotic South Seas foods, including \\"sizzling teriyaki steak, savory shrimp tempura, fried almonds in rich egg batter, and raisin ice cream topped with flaming caramel sauce.\\" The signature drink was the non-alcoholic Planter's Punch, served in a tall frosted glass with faux flower garnish. In 1962, a full dinner, including drink and dessert, cost under $4. Guests at the restaurant were given free leis. The back of the menu described the show: Disneyland's horticulturalist, Morgan \\"Bill\\" Evans, intended to use an African coral tree as the central feature in the dining patio, but Walt Disney said it wasn't big enough; Evans replaced the real tree with a 35-foot-high artificial tree with handcrafted artificial leaves and flower blossoms. In summer 1962, Disneyland produced a weekly live television show for Los Angeles station KTTV called Meet Me at Disneyland, to entice local residents to visit the theme park on weekdays. The new Tahitian Terrace was featured in the sixth episode, \\"Tahitian Terrace Show\\", which aired on July 14, 1962. The episode included a demonstration of Polynesian dances by the Royal Tahitians, and an appearance by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. In 1972, a new show was performed at the Tahitian Terrace by the Kau'i-Pono dance company, who also performed at the Polynesian Village Resort at Walt Disney World. The restaurant closed on April 17, 1993. It reopened three months later with a new theme based on the 1992 hit movie Aladdin. Redubbed Aladdin's Oasis Dinner Show, the waterfalls and rockwork of the performing area were replaced with a replica of the huge fanged mouth that forms the entrance of the movie's Cave of Wonders. The new dinner theater could accommodate up to eight shows a day. In early 1997, the dinner show was replaced by a stage show named Aladdin & Jasmine's Story-Tale Adventures and the area was renamed simply Aladdin's Oasis. This stage show closed in April 2008 and was replaced by Secrets of the Stone Tiger, which promoted Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. After that promotion ended in late 2008, the stage and dining area were closed off and characters from Aladdin would meet guests. In 2014, the restaurant and seating portion of Aladdin's Oasis re-opened for On the Go dining packages for Fantasmic!, in 2015 for Paint the Night, and in 2016 for the Main Street Electrical Parade. Characters from Aladdin stopped meeting guests in 2016, when Moana began meeting guests until Aladdin's Oasis closed on May 16, 2018. In December 2018, Aladdin's Oasis was replaced by a new Polynesian themed food counter, namedTropical Hideaway.

Biography - Early life  Musallam Bseiso was born in Bisan, Palestine. He attended school in Beersheba and Gaza, graduating from The Bishop Gobat School in Jerusalem. From the rise of his youth, he worked and participated in the creation of numerous Jordanian and Arab newspapers. At an early age, he was already writing for the Haifa and Jerusalem newspapers. Additionally, he was a correspondent stationed in Gaza for a number of newspapers in the 1940s, including the Associated Press (1948), the Egyptian \\"Al-Ahram\\", and the Jordanian \\"Al-Nasr\\". In 1951, he founded his own weekly newspaper, Al-Hawadeth (Arabic: ), in Jordan. Two years later, in 1952, Musallam Bseiso was elected as secretary of the Jordanian Press Syndicate. Mr. Bseiso remained actively involved in issues pertaining to the liberation of Palestine until his death in October 2017 at the age of 91.http://www.addustour.com/articles/981290-ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ™-Ÿäÿ∫ŸäŸëÿ®-ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿπŸÑÿßŸÖŸä- ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ-Ÿàÿ¨ŸäŸá-ÿ®ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥Ÿà  Biography - Expanded description  In 1945, he worked as a writer and correspondent in the city of Gaza for the following daily and weekly newspapers: \\"al-Sha‚Äôab\\" Daily, Jaffa \\"Nida‚Äô al-Ard\\" Weekly, Jaffa \\"Sawt al-Sha‚Äôab\\" Weekly, Bethlehem \\"al-wihda\\" Daily, Jerusalem \\"al-sawadi\\" Weekly, Cairo In 1948, he worked as a war correspondent in the Jordanian, Iraqi and Egyptian fronts after the cessation of hostilities under an armistice on May 15, 1948. Bseiso attended the meetings that followed the truce (between the Israelis and representatives of the Jordanian and Egyptian armies), in his capacity as an assistant war correspondent to the famous journalist John Roderick (of the Associated Press). He then worked as a reporter at the HQ of the Arab News Agency (Reuter) in Cairo. While working in Palestine in 1948, Bseiso was the first to deliver (broadcast/announce/cover) the news about the assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte (the United Nations Security Council‚Äôs mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1947-1948), who was assassinated in Jerusalem by the Israeli extremist group Lehi), while pursuing his official duties and meeting with the Israeli side, after he had already met with the Jordanian side. That same year, Bseiso had also worked for 2 months with the Arab News Agency (Reuter) in Cairo, and happened to be the first journalist to enter the Interior Ministry‚Äôs building in Cairo 1 hour after the assassination of the Prime Minister of Egypt at the time, Mahmoud Fahmi an-Nuqrashi. Bseiso saw an-Nuqrashi‚Äôs dead body in front of the elevator at the ministry, and also saw the assassin (a student from the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Fouad I). In 1949, when the first military coup in the Arab region took place (led by Husni al-Za‚Äôim), Bseiso went to Damascus for just one week, and realized through his contacts with some journalist friends that the coup had been covered and planned by \\"Tapline Petroleum\\" company and that Husni al-Za‚Äôim was chosen to lead the takeover. Bseiso then returned to Amman to work at the \\"al-‚ÄòUrdun\\" newspaper, (which was owned by the late Khalil Nasr, Abu Anis), working with other journalists, including the late Khairi Hammad. In 1951, Bseiso started a weekly newspaper called \\"al-Hawadeth\\", which was one of the most important and competitive weekly newspapers in Jordan, particularly due to its selection of news topics and investigative articles. The newspaper was published weekly up until 1954, when its production was stopped, and disrupted by several successive governments in Jordan ‚Äì namely, the governments of the late Tawfiq Abu al-Huda and the late Fawzi al-Mulqi. The newspaper was opposed to the government‚Äôs policies of suppressing freedoms, which were quite evident in the targeted arrests of members of political parties. Moreover, the newspaper was against the government‚Äôs appeasement of British policy and orders, which paved the way for the establishment of the Israeli entity in Palestine. In 1953, Bseiso was instrumental in calling for the foundation of several labor unions, which the government agreed to establish, in collaboration with the late Musa Qwaider, the late Husni Khuffash, the late Zidan Yunus, and others. He was also behind the government‚Äôs issuance of the Jordan Press Association Law No. 7 1953, which was published in the Official Newspaper No. 1131 dated January 17, 1953. Bseiso was one of the members of the tripartite committee, which had invited owners and editors of newspapers to the first meeting of journalists, where the first Association Council (below) was elected on March 17, 1953, in the offices of \\"al-Jazeera\\" newspaper in Amman.

The telegram also included an invitation to attend the Arab Journalism Conference in Cairo, during which the creation of the Arab Journalists Union was announced, and which was held under the patronage of Major General Muhammad Najeeb, and in the presence of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Hussein el-Shafei, Kamal el-Din Hussein, Khaled Mohi El Din and Salah Salem ‚Äì members of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). The delegation that represented the Jordanian Press Association included: Tayseer Thibyan, Musallam Bseiso, and Jamal al-Hasan. In 1956, Bseiso worked at the Syrian radio, preparing the news in English. He also was the Managing Editor at the \\"al-Ayyam\\" daily newspaper in Damascus. After the Arabization of the Jordanian army and the decommissioning of Lieutenant-General Sir John Bagot Glubb, better known as Glubb Pasha (who was commander of Transjordan‚Äôs Arab Legion), Bseiso returned to Amman and joined the Middle East News Agency‚Äôs office in Amman, as a Managing Editor. In 1957, Bseiso returned to Damascus after Suleiman Nabulsi‚Äôs government in Jordan was dismissed, and he joined the Middle East News Agency‚Äôs office in Damascus, as a Managing Editor. He also worked as the Managing Editor of the \\"al-Tali‚Äôa\\" daily newspaper until 1958. After the coup on the Syrian-Egyptian union, Syrian newspapers resumed publication, and Bseiso worked as the Managing Editor of \\"al-Sada\\" daily newspaper, which changed back to its old name \\"al-Rai al-Aam\\". Between 1968-1979, Bseiso worked as a General Director of the Jordanian Paper and Cardboard Factories Company.

It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1897. History The bell tower. Under the current building foundations have been found remains of a Roman hypocaustum . The church was likely founded in 1095 by Count Pedro Ans√∫rez, although there are no remains of this original structure. The oldest parts of the current temple date to the late 12th century: the gallery in the northern side of the building and the tower, both in Romanesque style. The tower, one of the symbols of Valladolid, has four floors, the upper three featuring windows, and a pyramidal top. The naves and sanctuary of the church were rebuilt in the 14th century in Gothic style, following the style of Burgos Cathedral. The church has three aisles, with three polygonal apses and a transept. The nave and the aisles are rib vaulted. Due to a poor design and construction and the increasing size of the parish population, the building underwent successive additions and reparations: in the mid-16th century, architect Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n restored the collapsing building, adding buttresses and several windows. Also from this period date the high altar retablo, by Juan de Juni (1550-1562; now in the Valladolid Cathedral). Several Baroque altarpieces were executed for the church's interior during the 17th and 18th centuries, hiding the original Gothic appearance. In the early 20th century the building was extensively restored and rebuilt in order to show its original Romanesque-Gothic appearance, following the doctrines of the French architect Eug√®ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc.

Only one prototype was built and flown. Development The Dassault company designed a light transport aircraft in the late 1950s, designated MD.415 and later named Communaut√©, as a potential replacement for the Dassault MD 315 Flamant in its trainer, command transport or ambulance aircraft roles. The Communaut√© was a cantilever low-wing monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear with room for two crew and up to ten passengers. Powered by two wing-mounted Turbomeca Bastan turboprops, the prototype (F-WJDN) first flew on 10 May 1959. The company also developed a military version designated the MD.410 Spirale. Retaining 90% commonality with the Communaut√©, the Spirale had all the windows removed and transparent nose panels added. It also had provision for cannon or machine-gun armament and was fitted with under-wing hardpoints for weapons. It was intended that the Spirale could be used for close-support, reconnaissance or transport roles. Neither the Communaut√© nor the Spirale received any production orders and a high-wing development designated Spirale III was also abandoned.

He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates 1972-2001, and was its Democratic floor leader 1991-2001\\\\. From 2005 to 2010, he was chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia. Personal life and non-political career Cranwell attended Richlands High School in Tazewell County, Virginia. He received a B.S. degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1965, and his J.D. from the University of Richmond School of Law in 1968. He was then admitted to the Virginia State Bar and took up practice in Roanoke County, Virginia. He is an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar, the American Bar Association, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the Academy of Rail Labor Attorneys, the Million Dollar Advocates Forum, the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association and the Roanoke County-Salem Bar Association. Cranwell currently resides in Vinton, Virginia and is a member of Vinton's Chamber of Commerce and its Lions Club. He has been married twice and had six children. Political career Dick Cranwell at the 2008 Democratic National Convention Cranwell was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1972, sharing the multi-member 8th district (Craig and Roanoke Counties and the city of Salem) with Republican Raymond Robrecht. In 1982, after redistricting, he shared the same district, now numbered the 7th, with another Republican, G. Steven Agee. A second redistricting converted the House entirely to single-member districts in 1983. He won election in the new 14th district, made up of pieces of Craig, Roanoke and Bedford Counties. He stayed in the 14th until his retirement from the House in 2001. Cranwell served as chair of the Militia and Police committee 1978-1987, then took over the chairmanship of the Finance committee. In September 1991, Speaker A. L. Philpott, a terminal cancer patient, retired. Cranwell lost to Tom Moss of Norfolk for the Democratic Caucus nomination to succeed Philpott. Moss then became Speaker, and Cranwell became Majority leader. Republicans gained parity with Democrats in the House after the 1997 elections, part of a Republican sweep driven by gubernatorial candidate Jim Gilmore's campaign promise to eliminate the personal property tax on automobiles. While the Democrats retained nominal majority caucus status and Moss remained Speaker, committee chairs were shared between the two parties, and Republican Harry Parrish became Finance co-chair with Cranwell. The committee sharing relationship continued for two years after Republicans took majority control in 2000. Moss conceded the Minority leader position to Cranwell. The Republicans had complete control of the redistricting process in 2001, and dismantled Cranwell's district. Portions of his district were split among three Republican-held districts. Cranwell retired to focus on his law practice. Cranwell was elected as state Democratic party chair on June 18, 2005.

Parallax measurements put it at a distance of from the Earth. The two components of this system have an angular separation of 7.7 arcseconds, which, at their estimated distance, is equivalent to a projected separation of about 560 Astronomical Units (AU), or 560 times the separation of the Earth from the Sun. The star and its ring resemble an eye, and it is sometimes known by the nickname \\"Sauron's Eye\\". Components This is a young system with an estimated age of about 8 million years. The primary member A has a stellar classification of A0 V, while its smaller companion B is a red dwarf with a classification of M2.5 V. The luminosity class of 'V' indicates that both stars belong to the main sequence and are generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at their cores. The primary is emitting this energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of about 9,378 K, which gives it the white hue characteristic of A-type stars. It has a radius about 168% of the radius of the Sun and 218% of the Sun's mass. By comparison, the secondary has only 30% of a solar mass. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is similar to the proportion in the Sun. Debris disk In 1991, the primary was found to have an excess of infrared emission, implying that it has a circumstellar debris disk. Observations using the Near-Infrared Multi-Object Spectrometer aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007 indicated that the dust had a reddish spectrum similar to that of tholins. The disk was resolved with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009, confirming that it exists. Based on these images, the disk has a radius of 75 AU and a width of less than 18.5 AU. It may have some asymmetries and the center appears to be slightly offset from the star. The dust in the disk is likely the result of collisions between larger particles. In 2011, observations of the ring offset by the Subaru Telescope implies that one or more planets would likely exist within gaps tugging at its dust grains. With a new image in 2014, the configuration and alignment of the dust ring and HR4796A has been nicknamed \\"Eye of Sauron\\". In 2017 a group using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer infrared spectroscopy of the infrared excess determined that the bright narrow ring is made up of very red devolatilzed cometary material, and that a second faint, hot diffuse dust component likely due to inspiralling material escaping from the ring was present close to the star and evaporating. The discovery of a complex dust structure about 1,600 AU across, enveloping HR 4796A, was announced in March 2018. The structure is believed to have been formed by the pressure of starlight from HR 4796A expelling dust from the debris disk far into space. The structure is much more extended in one direction than the other, possibly due to either the motion of HR 4796A through the interstellar medium, or the gravitational influence of HR 4796B. Hubble image of dust structure surrounding HR 4796A Kinematics The space velocity of HR 4796 in the Galactic coordinate system is = . This trajectory and the location of the system suggests that it may be a member of the TW Hydrae association of stars that share a common origin. A low-mass member of this association, identified as 2MASS J12354893‚àí3950245, may be a tertiary component of the HR 4796 system. It has a proper motion matching HR 4796, suggesting it is gravitationally bound to the other two stars, and is separated from the pair by a distance of about 13,500 AU.

In 1873, local businessman George A. Mitchell founded the village of Clam Lake (renamed Cadillac, Michigan, in 1882) and constructed the Clam Lake Canal, connecting Little Clam Lake to Big Clam Lake. At the time, the canal enabled logging on the west side of Big Clam Lake; logs floated through the canal entered Little Clam Lake, on the east shore of which stood lumber mills, the railroad and the Village of Clam Lake. The names of the two lakes were changed in 1903, with Little Clam Lake renamed as Lake Cadillac (for the renamed community) and Big Clam Lake as Lake Mitchell, in honor of William W. Mitchell, the nephew and business partner of George A. Mitchell. Following the passing of the lumber era the lake became a regional tourist destination.

Television commercials for the product claim it will keep fruits and vegetables fresh for up to 30 days by absorbing ethylene gas.Debbie Meyer Green Bag Website accessed January 4, 2008Green Bags Commercial as viewed on the Green Bags homepage, accessed on January 4, 2008 Consumer Reports found, other than for bananas, that these bags caused foods to rot prematurely compared to standard Ziploc bags. Ethylene perpetuates the ripening process of produce and plant material coming from a root system, and thus the bags' ethylene absorption is intended to slow the ripening (and thus the decaying) process and preserve the produce's shelf life. The product's packaging acknowledges that certain vegetables and fruits are preserved better in the bags than others (strawberries, for example, are only advertised to last about nine days in a Green Bag compared to over three weeks for cabbage or carrots). The product's website claims that \\"Oya mineral form of Zeolite\\" is the ingredient that facilitates the gas absorption. In the UK, similar bags are sold by PMS international. They are sold under the \\"Stay Fresh System\\" name. These bags have an endorsement from a fictional \\"Chef Excellence\\" and a stock photo of a generic chef from iStockPhoto. In 2010, YouTube personality Stuart Ashen pointed out the endorsement, creating an Internet meme and numerous parodies featuring him sponsoring other products.  Effectiveness  In 2009, a US-based expert microbiology testing firm performed third party testing on Evert Fresh Green Bags in their controlled lab environment, at the same time they were also sold under license by Debbie Meyer/Housewares America, Inc. The results from their findings had concluded that produce stored in Green Bags had less deterioration and thus more value than produce stored in regular commercial packaging, or that of a competitor which was also tested. Evert Fresh Corp, owner of Green Bags products and trademarks, also received written correspondence from Dolehttp://www.dole.com// out of their TropiFresh division stating that their own internal testing had concluded as much as 50% less deterioration when they used Green Bags as compared to regular commercial packaging. Dole Tropifresh also cited close to 50% reduction in tip rot of the asparagus as well. Several television news programs have done consumer affairs segments on the product. KDKA-TV Channel 2 News in Pittsburgh featured Debbie Meyer Green Bags in its recurring \\"Does It Really Do That?\\" segment and came up with mixed results.\\"Does It Really Do That?\\" portion of the KDKA Newscast on November 1, 2007, accessed on January 4, 2008 KDKA reported that \\"strawberries, bananas and tomatoes\\" spoiled in both green bags and standard storage. While the Green Bags did keep carrots and green peppers \\"much fresher much longer\\", grapes and bananas did better without the bags. The viewer assisting the reporter with test said she would not buy the bags for regular use. WPVI-TV in Philadelphia also reported on the bags. The station had a viewer keep a log for thirty days.\\"Colleen's log\\" posted on WPVI Website February 19, 2008, accessed on February 25, 2008 They tested Debbie Meyers Green Bags against Ziploc Storage Bags, Ziploc Storage Containers, and the food items' original packaging.

She is famous for her nightgowns with full flowing skirt width and generous sweep. Early life Olga Erteszek along with her husband Jan (1913‚Äì1986), a lawyer, came to the United States in 1941. Fleeing Poland and the invading Nazi army, the young couple left their family and most possessions. After emigrating to Russia and then Japan, they both eventually secured a visa and landed in California. Company history As the daughter of a corsetiere, Olga worked in a sweatshop making girdles and bras, and Jan found work in sales. One day she spotted a woman on a trolley with hosiery rolled to her knees. She said to Jan that it was a shame that women didn't have at least some bit of finery to hold up their stockings, something to make them feel feminine no matter how severe the sacrifices or how limited their funds were during the war effort. Jan encouraged her to create something herself to facilitate the woman, so with a $5.00 sewing machine rental and $5.00 of material, she got started. Olga sewed a dozen or so lace-trimmed garter belts that Jan sold to the foundations buyer at an elite department store. And this started an industry that blossomed to employ 2,000 people. Enduring from the 1940s to today, Olga is known as America‚Äôs leading maker of fashionable lingerie, sleepwear and loungewear. At one time, Olga directed a team of 17 designers who were dedicated to change the look of women‚Äôs confining ‚Äúunspeakables‚Äù to fashion pieces that shaped the bust, smoothed the tummy and enticed the gentlemen. Jan found his calling as the head marketing and sales director. It was Jan who insisted that Olga herself appear in the advertising under the tag line, ‚ÄúBehind every Olga there really is an Olga‚Äù. Holding the woman's record for patents at 28, Olga brought women many pleasing, comfortable and fashionable undergarments. In addition to winning many industry awards, Olga and her husband were honored for their community and humanitarian work. In 1985, they received the California Industrialist of the Year Award for lifetime achievement. Olga was one of the first businesses to initiate profit sharing for employees, and in 1967 it became a publicly owned corporation valued at $67 million. In 1984, Olga was ranked as a Fortune 500 company and one of the best 100 companies to work for in America. Ownership changes In 1984, Olga was purchased for $28 million by Warnaco which Olga and Jan felt was a good match for both companies had the same congruent philosophies. Shortly after this, a hostile takeover of the purchasing company changed the culture of the company drastically. In 1986, the same year that Olga and her daughter, and heir apparent, Christina were honored with the New York's Underfashion Club's Femmy Award, her husband, Jan, died. In 1988, the Intimate Apparel Council honored her with their first Intime Award. Notable items One notable piece of lingerie Olga designed was the Built In Bra Nightgown. This came about after a hospital stay, where she said at the time \\"The comfort and security...is hospital tested\\". These gowns provided the support and beauty a woman might want while convalescing. Although most famous for her bras, girdles and undergarments, her line of Spandex Blend nightgowns were quite successful for many years, but sadly for some, did not seem to continue to be produced much after the Warnaco takeover. Death Erteszek died of breast cancer in September 1989 at her home in Brentwood, California.Olga Erteszek died at 73 Her daughter Christina continued to design lingerie and has recently designed a bra which is cushioned to relieve underwire pressure and gently massages as you wear it to promote healthy breasts.

This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving critiques of their own work and by mentoring the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services. Unlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very participatory. Most conferences are divided into presentations, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more presenters and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work. An authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always Intensive writing workshops precede the conference.) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop. One popular series of authors' conferences is the Pattern Languages of Programming conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of software design patterns and pattern languages. Shepherding The shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process. Writers' workshop The writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6‚Äì10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments. =Examples= * Iowa Writers' Workshop * Clarion Writers Workshop * Gotham Writers' Workshop * Milford Writer's Workshop * DFW Writers Conference (DFWCon) See also * List of writers' conferences ReferencesExternal links *Pattern Languages of Programming conferences, organized by the Hillside Group *How PLoP Works by Bobby Woolf *ploptory ‚Äì Notes on how the PLoP conferences have been run *Shepherding Guidelines ‚Äì From PLoP '98 *\\"A Pattern Language for Shepherding\\" (Word, PDF) by Neil B.

Her sister ship Provence was launched a year earlier at Newcastle. Bretagne was constructed with three boilers and Provence with only two, making Provence less capable of increasing speed to counteract possible delays. Career with SGTM After two brief shakedown cruises, SS Bretagne began her maiden voyage at Marseilles on 14 February 1952, traveling to Genoa, Naples, Barcelona, Dakar, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, concluding in Buenos Aires. Bretagne joined Provence in liner and immigration service from Europe to South America. Fine accommodations met First class passengers, but the majority of the ship's berths were for third and fourth class passengers, the latter sleeping in large communal dormitories segregated by sex. These berths were mainly filled with poor Italian emigrants seeking a new start in South America. Career with Chandris Lines Declining interest in tourism and immigration led SGTM to offer SS Bretagne and SS Provence out to charter. At the same time, Anthony Chandris was looking to add a second liner to serve the Chandris Lines route between Greece and Australia. Bretagne was selected by reason of her third boiler and extra speed; 18 November 1960 saw the signing of a year-long charter contract with option to buy. The French seamen's union would continue to serve aboard Bretagne during that year and for six months following purchase. Sister ship SS Provence was chartered then purchased by Costa Line, who renamed her Enrico Costa. A major refit for SS Bretagne was undertaken in Genoa in January 1961 in order to eliminate third and fourth class berths and make room for 1,050 tourist class passengers. A second swimming pool was installed and air conditioning was brought to all the passenger areas, not just first class. In May, when the conversion was complete, Bretagne sailed to Boston under a new sub-charter contract with Caribbean Cruise Line to begin cruise ship service between New England and the Caribbean on 9 June 1961. Though passengers weren't too pleased with poor Caribbean Cruise Line service standards, Anthony Chandris was satisfied with the new interior layout. He purchased the Bretagne on 20 September 1961 in Southampton for UK¬£ 3 million, two months before his charter contract was to end. On 22 September 1961, Bretagne sailed as a \\"Europe Australia Line\\" ship (a subsidiary of Chandris) from Southampton to Australia by way of Madeira, Cape Town, Durban, Fremantle, Melbourne, arriving in Sydney on 26 October. Quickly turning around, the liner left the next day to visit Brisbane, Bali, Singapore, Colombo, Aden, Port Said, Piraeus, Marseilles and Lisbon before arriving again at Southampton. Bretagne made four more voyages to Australia and then was turned over to full Chandris ownership and control in June 1962. The ship was sent to Genoa for further changes including a new ballroom with seating for 500 so that live shows and entertainment could be staged during cruises. At this time the ship was rechristened SS Brittany and was re-staffed by 320 Greek seamen replacing the French. Brittany began her new career on 20 June 1962 with a series of nine week-long roundtrip cruises between New York and the West Indies, accepting only 500 passengers in the best cabins. These voyages were catered and operated by Chandris in close conjunction with Caribbean Cruise Lines ‚Äî publicity was favorable in contrast with the previous year. Capacity averaged 95% and plans were made to increase the number of cabins by 110 through the conversion of two refrigerated cargo areas, a process that was undertaken in transit by workmen brought aboard during the New York ‚Äì Caribbean cruises. The changes would create a single passenger class of 1,500 berths, including the 150 former first class ones, for an extended summer cruise season in 1963. On 12 September 1962, Brittany left Southampton to resume round-the-world winter service to Australasia. A new feature she offered was an accelerated process for customs and immigration formalities in Wellington, New Zealand by having three New Zealand Customs officials embark at Sydney to start their paperwork early. This innovation was well received. Fire and loss On her fourth trip back to Southampton, she stopped at Piraeus in late March 1963 with serious engine trouble, disembarking and flying her passengers onward to their destinations. Brittany was moved to a drydock for overhaul by Hellenic Shipyards in Skaramagas. Repairs were nearing completion on 8 April 1963 when a welder's torch set off a fire that burned quickly out of control. Fears of explosion from her own fuel tanks meant Brittany had to be towed out to harbor and beached to let the fire burn out the next day. The ship was a total loss; her hulk was sent to La Spezia for scrap in March 1964. The loss of Brittany led to the Chandris Lines purchase of in September, 1963; that ship was renamed Ellinis.

Background Running through a valley in a high-amenity rural area, the line is used by tourists and for commuter transport by local people. Railway enthusiasts from all over the world are attracted to it because of its use of steam engines and its small track gauge. Most of the passenger train services operate using modern diesel locomotives and railcars but the Zillertal Railway also has several steam locomotives which are used with heritage verandah rolling stock for special trains targeting tourists. Goods traffic is carried; standard gauge wagons to and from the main line network are carried on transporter wagons. In Jenbach the Zillertal Railway meets the √ñBB standard gauge line between Salzburg and Innsbruck and the metre gauge Achenseebahn. Jenbach is the only location in Austria where railways of three different track-gauges meet. History Mayrhofen im Zillertal station (1970s) The line was opened on 31 July 1902, serving the needs of residents of the upper Ziller valley and giving them access to Jenbach and the main line railway in the Inn Valley. Note: the target page refers to a Cable railway but this is a translation error; the page describes the Zillertalbahn. In 1956 the present day company name, Zillertaler Verkehrsbetriebe AG, (i.e. The Zillertaler Transport Company) was adopted when the company absorbed a local bus operation that had been founded in 1935. In 1965 the line was extended by 2.5 km to bring materials and equipment to a power station; the extension line has subsequently been removed once more. However at that time two diesel locomotives and some transporter wagons were acquired and the Zillertalbahn became the first railway in Austria to use \\"Zugfunk\\"‚Äîtrain control by radio. In 1976 extraction of magnesium ore from Tux came to an end; this traffic had been an important source of income for the line since 1928. Since 2005, points on the line have been operated remotely from the Jenbach Control Centre using fibre-optic technology. Route Bound by physics, the railway follows the river Ziller, as does the road \\"Zillertalstra√üe\\"; both road and rail remain mostly on the eastern \\"right\\" bank. It is single track for most of the route, broadening to two or even three tracks in some stations. Road crossings are mostly level, some protected by barriers. The sections Ramsau‚ÄìHippach‚ÄìZell am Ziller (3.33 km) and Kaltenbach-Stumm‚ÄìAngersbach‚ÄìAhrnbach (2.0 km) have been made double track.Karl Arne Richter (editor), Europ√§ische Bahnen '11, Eurailpress, Hamburg, 2010, At F√ºgen-Hart there is a siding to serve a timber company. Current operation In 2010 the annual freight traffic amounted to 320,000 tonnes, predominantly in connection with the forest products industry. 1.54 million passengers were carried in that year, a half-hourly service (of train and bus journeys combined) being introduced. Rolling stock to the United Kingdom Some of the Zillertal Railway's redundant rolling stock was donated by the railway to the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway in the UK. In July 2019 the Welshpool & Llanfair Light Railway announced that it had signed a contract with the Zillertalbahn to hire newly overhauled U-class 0-6-2T locomotive, No. 2 'Zillertal', for approximately two years. Ownership The Zillertaler Verkehrsbetriebe AG is (2010) owned by the Jenbach Marktgemeinde (i.e. local government unit) and other local communities (61%); individual shareholders (34%); and the Austrian state (5%).

Biography Evgenije \\"ƒêena\\" Popoviƒá was born in 1842 on his father's ship in Risan, a town in the Kingdom of Dalmatia of the Dual Monarchy of Austria- Hungary. Though born in Risan, where his parents had settled in before his birth, Popoviƒá's family descends from the Kuƒçi tribe. He finished grade school in Trieste as a school friend of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro. He later graduated Law School in Italy, gaining a PhD, and settled his life permanently in Italy naturalized. He was a lawyer in Italy, however, casually engaged in journalism and even the editing of Diritto newspaper for a period. He also wrote works on the Adriatic sea and several articles, which were published by local and international press. Popoviƒá was a friend of Italian patriot and member of the Risorgimento, participating in the detachments of Giuseppe Garibaldi during the struggle for Italian unification. Popoviƒá also participated in the Montenegrin-Ottoman War of 1876-1878, in which he was wounded twice. Together with several soldiers, Popoviƒá reported the events of the Montenegrin-Ottoman War to international press. Popoviƒá was the Montenegrin consul in Rome, Italy from 1897 till 1900, when he became the Montenegrin general-consul in Rome. While consul, Popovic visited a rich collection of Montenegro antiques. He held his position as general-consul until 1917. After Milo Matanovic resigned from position of PM, King Nicholas invited and appointed Evgenije Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Exile as well as Minister of Internal Affairs at the same time which was a traditional Montenegrin custom, on 11 June 1917. Since the Government has lost most support on the international scene after the break-off of Andrija Radoviƒá, Popoviƒá worked actively and hardly to regain the prestige for King Nicholas. He tried to persuade the Montenegrin consul to lobby Nicholas' policy in the United States, however he has already declared loyalty to Radoviƒá's Committee for Unification. With the liberation of Montenegro from the Central Powers' occupation by the Serbian armed forces after the break through the Balkan Front, Popoviƒá attempted to secure the return of Nicholas and the Government to Montenegro on 16 November 1918 at the British Court, but this attempt has met only refusal. Although also failing to secure France's support for Nicholas' return, he has managed to get confirmation that France shall respect the legal Montenegrin authorities in exile and secure that the local military administration shall administer in the name of the King. France also claimed it will remain neutral for Montenegro's internal affairs, respecting the King's authority but also not opposing the desire and free will of the Montenegrin people to decide. Popoviƒá's government and King Nicholas have accepted these terms, which henceforth became the basis for the Podgorica Assembly. Since late 1918 he was no longer in Neuilly, so the position of Minister of Internal Affairs is held by Dr. Pero ≈†oƒá. With the end of the Great War, Popoviƒá has lobbied at the Allied Powers' courts and managed to secure a Montenegrin seat for the post-war Paris Peace Conference. After the Podgorica Assembly has declared unification with Serbia and dethroned the Petroviƒá-Njego≈° dynasty, Popoviƒá dismissed and declared its decisions nullified and void. Popoviƒá complained to the Great Powers that the decision was illegal, but met little response. Disappointed by Popoviƒá's work, Nicholas replaced him with Jovan S. Plamenac, the organizer of the Christmas Uprising, an event which occurred several days earlier and met Popoviƒá's condemnation.

Design and development In 1928, Wilfrid T. Reid set up his own company in Montreal after working as an engineer for Canadian Vickers. His first design was a light aircraft that was intended to exploit a Canadian government programme to support the development of flying clubs. The Reid Rambler was primarily intended to be a training aircraft. The Rambler was a largely conventional sesquiplane design with wings braced with Warren trusses and which could be folded backwards for transport or storage. The fuselage was of fabric-covered steel tube construction and the pilot and a single passenger sat in tandem, open cockpits. The prototype (registration G-CAVO) was first flown at the Cartierville Airport on 23 September 1928 by Martin Berlyn. The test flight was nearly a disaster because the ailerons seized, leaving Berlyn with a dangerous approach and landing. A modification of the aileron control linkage rectified the problem. The Rambler continued to be developed, and in 1931, an improved version, the Rambler III, was flown with the more powerful Gipsy III engine. John C. Webster flew the MK III prototype in the British King's Cup Race that year. Operational history In December 1928, the Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Company purchased the Reid Aircraft Company and renamed it The Curtiss-Reid Aircraft Company. The new firm assumed control of the existing Rambler project and established a production line. A number of alterations were made to the production series including replacing the original ailerons with Frise-style ailerons, introducing an unbalanced rudder along with changes to the engine cowling, exhaust system and tailskid, and adding a head rest. Although it was intended principally for civilian use, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) evaluated the aircraft as a basic training aircraft. Although the RCAF employed many other ab-initio aircraft including the ubiquitous de Havilland Moth, senior military staff elected to purchase a small number of the Ramblers. Curtiss- Reid Ramblers enjoyed a relatively productive and lengthy career both in civilian and military use lasting well into the Second World War era.

Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons, most importantly to control rodents. Vermin aboard a ship can cause damage to ropes, woodwork, and more recently, electrical wiring. Also, rodents threaten ships' stores, devour crews' foodstuff, and can cause economic damage to ships' cargo such as grain. They are also a source of disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. Rat fleas are carriers of plague, and rats on ships were believed to be a primary vector of the Black Death. Cats naturally attack and kill rodents, and their natural ability to adapt to new surroundings made them suitable for service on a ship. In addition, they offer companionship and a sense of home, security and camaraderie to sailors away from home.  History  The African wildcat was probably first tamed in the Fertile Crescent during the first agricultural revolution that started about 10,000 years ago. Small cat bones excavated on Mediterranean islands indicate that cats were introduced around the beginning of the first millennium. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of archaeological cat specimens revealed that ancient Egyptian cats started spreading in the 8th century BCE along Mediterranean trading routes and reached a Viking port at the Baltic Sea by the 7th century. During the Age of Discovery from the 15th through the 18th centuries, explorers and traders took them on board their ships to much of the rest of the world.  Cats and superstition  Sometimes worshipped as deities, cats have long had a reputation as magical animals and numerous myths and superstitions sprang up among the unusually superstitious seafaring community.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . They were considered to be intelligent and lucky animals, and a high level of care was devoted to keeping them happy. Some sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. In some places polydactyl cats became known as \\"ship's cats\\". Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included, if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind. Some of these beliefs are rooted in reality. Cats are able to detect slight changes in the weather, as a result of their very sensitive inner ears, which also allow them to land upright when falling. Low atmospheric pressure, a common precursor of stormy weather, often makes cats nervous and restless. Cats naturally react to barometric pressure changes, through which a keen observer can detect unusual behavior and predict an incoming storm. The tradition that every ship needs a mascot made cats very welcome among sailors.  Notable examples  The prevalence of cats on ships has led to them being reported on by a number of noted seafarers. The outbreak of the Second World War, with the spread of mass communication and the active nature of the world's navies, also led to a number of ship's cats becoming celebrities in their own right.. = Blackie = alt=Atlantic Conference August 1941: Churchill restrains 'Blackie' the cat, the mascot of HMS Prince of Wales, from joining the USS McDougal, an American destroyer, while the ship's company stand to attention during the playing of the National Anthem Blackie was HMS Prince of Wales's ship's cat. During the Second World War, he achieved worldwide fame after Prince of Wales carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, in August 1941, where he secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt for several days in a secure anchorage. This meeting resulted in the declaration of the Atlantic Charter, but as Churchill prepared to step off Prince of Wales, Blackie approached. Churchill stooped to bid farewell to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill.. Blackie survived the sinking of Prince of Wales by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service later that year, and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and his fate is unknown. = Camouflage = Camouflage was the ship's cat aboard a US Coast Guard LST in the Pacific theater, WWII. He was known for chasing enemy tracer rounds across the deck. = Chibley = Chibley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship Barque Picton Castle. She was rescued from an animal shelter and circumnavigated the world five times. Picton Castle‚Äôs role as a training ship resulted in Chibley being introduced to a large number of visitors and becoming a celebrity in her own right. Chibley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea. = Convoy = Convoy asleep in a hammock aboard HMS Hermione Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS Hermione. He was so named because of the number of times he accompanied the ship on convoy escort duties. Convoy was listed in the ship's book and provided with a full kit, including a tiny hammock in which he slept. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when Hermione was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205. = Emmy = Emmy was the ship's cat on . She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy jumped ship while in port in Quebec City. The crew returned her to the ship, but she left again, leaving her kittens behind. The Empress of Ireland left without her, which was regarded as a terrible omen. Early the next morning Empress of Ireland was struck by the while steaming through fog near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and rapidly sank, killing over 1,000 people. = Felix = Felix was the ship's cat aboard Mayflower II when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957 to symbolize the solidarity between the UK and the US following World War II. He was given his own life jacket and once suffered a broken paw after a mishap. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. Photos and stories about Felix appeared in National Geographic, Life, and Yankee magazine after his arrival in the US. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. He was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The current captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix entitled Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures. The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.. = Halifax = Halifax was the name given to Alvah and Diana Simon's ship's cat who was found in the port of Halifax, on their way to winter at Tay Bay in 1994, on Roger Henry. The cat spent all of the time iced in on the boat with Alvah, when Diana had to leave for family purposes. Alvah's book North To The Night describes his adventure in the ice with Halifax the cat, who ended up losing half an ear to frostbite. = Jenny = Jenny was the name of the ship's cat aboard and was mentioned in the accounts of several of the crew members who survived the ocean liner's fateful 1912 maiden voyage. She was transferred from Titanics sister ship and gave birth in the week before Titanic left Southampton. The galley is where Jenny and her kittens normally lived, cared for by the victualling staff who fed them kitchen scraps. Stewardess Violet Jessop later wrote in her memoir that the cat \\"laid her family near Jim, the scullion, whose approval she always sought and who always gave her warm devotion.\\" Jenny and her kittens went down with the ship. = Kiddo = M. Vaniman and Kiddo Kiddo seemed to have stowed away on the airship America, when it left from Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1910 to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Kiddo was upset at first by the experience, but settled in and, evidently, was better at predicting bad weather than the barometer. The airship's engines failed, and the small crew and Kiddo abandoned the America for lifeboats when they sighted the Royal Mail steamship SS Trent near Bermuda. Kiddo then was retired from being a ship's cat and was taken care of by Edith Wellman Ainsworth, the daughter of the American journalist, explorer, and aviator, Walter Wellman, who made the daring attempt. = Mrs Chippy = Mrs Chippy, a tiger-striped male tabby ship's cat Mrs Chippy (actually a male) was the ship's cat aboard Endurance, the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. When the ship was lost, having become trapped and eventually crushed in pack ice, Shackleton ordered the sled dogs and Mrs Chippy shot, as Shackleton had decided that the animals could not be kept during the arduous journey ahead. = Nansen = Nansen was the ship's cat on , which was used for the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. He was brought on board by cabin boy Johan Koren, and was named after Fridtjof Nansen. He died on 22 June 1898, and was buried in the Antarctic. = Peebles = Lieutenant Commander R H Palmer, plays with Peebles, the ship's cat, who leaps through his clasped arms on board HMS Western Isles at Tobermory, Mull Peebles was the ship's cat aboard HMS Western Isles. Another cat who became a favourite of the ship's crew, he was known to be particularly intelligent and would shake the hands of strangers when they entered the wardroom. = Pooli = Pooli in uniform on July 4, 1959, her 15th birthday Pooli served aboard a United States attack transport during the Second World War. . She was awarded with three service ribbons and four battle stars. = Rinda = Rinda was the ship's cat on the Norwegian cargo ship , which was torpedoed and sunk during World War II. When the surviving crew realized that their beloved ship's cat was not on board the lifeboat, they rowed around in the night until they finally heard a pitiful \\"miauu\\" in the distance. \\"We rowed as hard as we could and laughed and cried when we lifted the sopping wet furball aboard\\". The cat became the ship's cat aboard the rescue ship, the British armed naval trawler , and was given the name Rinda after the previous ship. = Simon = Simon was the ship's cat of HMS Amethyst during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, and was wounded in the bombardment of the ship which killed 25 of Amethyst‚Äôs crew, including the commanding officer. He soon recovered and resumed killing rats and keeping up the crew's morale. He was appointed to the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon and became a celebrity after the ship escaped the Yangtze and returned to Britain. He later succumbed to an infection and died shortly after. Tributes poured in and his obituary appeared in The Times. He was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal, the only cat ever to earn the award, and was buried with full naval honours. = Tarawa = Tarawa was a kitten rescued from a pillbox during the Battle of Tarawa by the United States Coast Guard. She was a mascot aboard an LST, but did not get along with the LST's other mascot, a dog named Kodiak, and jumped ship ashore. = Tiddles = Tiddles at his station aboard HMS Victorious. Despite a long tradition, there are no longer ships' cats aboard Royal Navy vessels Tiddles was the ship's cat on a number of Royal Navy aircraft carriers. He was born aboard , and later joined . He was often seen at his favourite station, on the aft capstan, where he would play with the bell-rope. He eventually travelled over during his time in service. = Togo = Togo was the ship's cat on . A Persian cat, Togo was known for resting in the barrels of the ship's main battery. = Trim = Trim was the ship's cat on a number of the ships under the command of Matthew Flinders during voyages to circumnavigate and map the coastline of Australia during 1801‚Äì1803. He became a favourite of the crew and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. He remained with Flinders until death. He has been the subject of a number of works of literature, and statues have been placed in his honour, including one that sits on a window sill at the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney. = Unsinkable Sam = Previously named Oscar, he was the ship's cat of the German battleship Bismarck. When she was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 out of a crew of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS Cossack (one of the ships responsible for destroying Bismarck). Cossack herself was torpedoed and sunk a few months later, on 24 October, killing 159 of her crew, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS Ark Royal, which was torpedoed and sunk in November that year. Oscar was again rescued, but it was decided at that time to transfer him to a home on land. By now known as Unsinkable Sam because of surviving the three ship sinkings, he was given a new job as shore duty mouse-catcher in the office buildings of the Governor General of Gibraltar because he still had \\"six lives to go\\". He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him exists in the private collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.  Today  The Royal Navy banned cats and other pet animals from all ships on the ocean in 1975 on hygiene grounds; however, cats are still common on many private ships. One notable example is Toolbox (a feral kitten born in a toolbox), the senior ship's cat, official warrant officer and \\"Captain's Assistant\\" aboard the modern Kalmar Nyckel. A celebrity in her own right, she is the subject of two books. A number of ship's cats were included in the chronicles for the National Geographic Magazine (1968‚Äì1970) and detailed in the 1972 book Dove by Robin Lee Graham, which was adapted into the 1974 film The Dove.  In fiction  There are at least two books called The Ship's Cat: a 1977 children's book by Richard Adams and Alan Aldridge, and a 2000 novel by Jock Brandis. Matthew Flinders' Cat is a 2002 novel by Bryce Courtenay featuring tales about Trim, the ship's cat that circumnavigated Australia. In Fish Head, a 1954 children's book by Jean Fritz, the eponymous cat unwittingly becomes a ship's cat.. In science fiction, the role of the ship's cat has been transferred to spaceships. Notable examples include Cordwainer Smith's 1955 short story \\"The Game of Rat and Dragon\\" and Andre Norton's 1968 novel The Zero Stone featuring a telepathic mutant feline named Eet. Robert A. Heinleins The Cat Who Walks Through Walls features a cat named Pixel who travels on various space adventures with the narrator. On film, Alien (1979) and the sequel Aliens (1986) feature Jones (\\"Jonesy\\") aboard Nostromo.

In 1991, Amy's parents buy her a brand new car for her sixteenth birthday. Amy loves the car, but her parents don't want her to take advantage by using it whenever she wants. After an argument with her parents, Amy spends her birthday at a friend's house. She had previously gone to a restaurant with them, and her father didn't like the fact that she was wearing such a revealing outfit (to keep the peace, Amy's mother told her outfit was lovely). She also flirted with the waiter, by looking at him with the corner of her eye, with a seductive smile on her face. Amy gets into an accident, crashing her car. Her father takes her to Joey Buttafuoco's shop to get it fixed. She flirts with Joey lightly, asking him a lot of questions about his personal life. She begins crashing her car on purpose, using it as an excuse to see Joey again. Eventually, the two begin an affair. He is in his mid-thirties while she's in her teens (a minor). Amy becomes increasingly desperate about her relationship with Joey. She has strong feelings for him, and even though she knows he is married to his high school sweetheart Mary Jo Buttafuoco, she constantly wants to spend time with him. When he refuses to leave Mary Jo, Amy decides to hire someone to kill her. All her potential accomplices prove unwilling to get the job done, so Amy eventually decides to kill Mary Jo herself. Amy goes to the Buttafuoco house and tells Mary Jo that Joey was cheating on her with Amy's younger sister. When Mary Jo expresses disbelief, Amy shows her the T-shirt that Joey gave her, but Mary Jo still doesn't believe Amy, saying that Joey gave that shirt to a lot of his customers. As Mary Jo is about to close the door on Amy, she talks out her gun and shoots Mary Jo in the head. The shot doesn't kill Mary Jo, but leaves her face partially paralyzed for life. Joey realizes it was Amy who shot his wife. Mary Jo confirms this in a lineup. The reports of the shooting spread through the media and Amy is given the nickname \\"Long Island Lolita\\". Eventually, in late 1992, Amy is sentenced to five to fifteen years in jail. Joey Buttafuoco is convicted of statutory rape in October 1993 and served six months in prison. Reception The critic Camille Paglia dismissed the film, calling it \\"meandering\\" and criticizing reviewers for hailing it as the best of the three films that were made about Amy Fisher.Paglia, Camille.

It is located in Washington, DC and is under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia Public Schools. It was built in 1970, shortly after the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots which ravaged its neighborhood of Columbia Heights. Over five hundred students are currently enrolled from pre-school to fifth grade. The school has regular graffiti cleaning, students have received free dental care, and D.C. Discovery Days give them field trips out of the neighborhood. Nevertheless, a student from Tubman joined others in voicing concern over safety in the public school district. 85% of the student body qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. Former principal Sadia M. White won a National Distinguished Principals award in 2004 for her work at Tubman. According to National Association of Elementary School Principals, under White, Tubman Elementary met all its goals for standardized test scores and White supervised the launch of an inclusion-teaching model featuring team- teaching by general education, special education teachers, and teachers of new English-language learners. The association also commended her institution of a comprehensive school-wide positive-approach discipline program that included a due process system for punishment referrals and intervention strategies for classroom teachers for preventing problems. On November 27, 2001, First Lady Laura Bush hosted Tubman Elementary students at the White House for a screening of the film, Twice Upon a Christmas.

The city is the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Chota. History In pre-Inca times, chotanos territories were occupied by various cultures, such as Los Huambos in the West and Cuismanco in the east, getting a strong influence of the Chavin, Wari and Moche cultures of which there are archaeological remains of great importance as Pacopampa, Negropampa, Rejopampa and others. The foundation of the city of Chota took place on two dates: one in 1552 and another in 1559, it is not clear if it was on these two dates. During the Pacific War, after the Battle of San Pablo the Araucanian (from the city of Arauco) entered Chota, to which the people decided to poison the waters of the river Colpamayo and by that the Chilean ordered the burning of the city. On August 29, 1882, Chota was burned by Chilean troops in retaliation for the defeat they suffered in San Pablo and consider it as the headquarters of the North. Thousands of homes fell, the church was also burned, saving the image of the Patroness, Mary Immaculate, whose dogma was proclaimed on December 8. Geography Chota is located north of Cajamarca and east of Chiclayo. It lies at above sea level on the Acunta plateau, on the eastern slope of the Andes. The city is bounded on three sides by rivers of the westernmost Amazon basin: to the north is the San Mateo, to the east the Colpamayo. Both flow broadly westward into the Rio Chotano, which forms Chota's south-western boundary. =Climate= The city generally has a temperate climate. The rainfalls are due to El Ni√±o cyclically because of the proximity to the Equator and for being a city in thermal ground floor. It has a mild winter and a hot and rainy summer from November to April. The average temperature is 17.8 ¬∞C. Festivals The main festival of the city is the San Juan Bautista festival. It starts on June 13 with the triumphal entry in a procession, bearing to June 24 as the central day. The activities that are carried out are: * The identity of the chotanos day, held on 22 June, which pays tribute to Jos√© Manuel Silva and Anaximando Becerra Vega Mateola, independence hero and poet respectively. Both are famous people of Chota. * The festival of Sanjuanpampa, held at the farm of Corepuquio where festivals and concerts on 23 and 24 of June are performed. Also held here cultural events, typical dishes, dances, Paso horse contests, bullfights, motocross and soccer, but in daytime hours. * The election of the beauty \\"Flor de Chota\\", where ladies compete from all the villages and towns of the district of Chota. It takes place in two phases: qualifying and the grand final on 23 and 24 June respectively. *On the days 25, 26 and 27 of June, bullfights are held with international cartel in the famous Plaza de toros El Vizcaino, the second largest in Peru after the Plaza de toros de Acho in Lima. For this reason it is considered the Bullfighting Capital of Northern Peru.

Together with Karlbergskanalen, Karlbergssj√∂n, and Klara Sj√∂, Barnhusviken constitute the nameless body of water which separates Kungsholmen from the city districts Norrmalm and Vasastaden and the northern suburb Solna.

The aircraft were used to run the main routes of the United States Air Mail service until the introduction of three-engined aircraft in 1928. Development The United States Post Office had been running the air mail service since 1918 mainly using variants of the de Havilland DH.4 biplane. In 1925, it decided to modernize and placed an order with Douglas for a replacement aircraft based on the Douglas O-2 observation biplane. The company modified an O-2 by covering over the forward cockpit to make a mail compartment and moving the pilot into what had been the observer's cockpit. The aircraft was designated the DAM-1 (Douglas Air-Mail-One) but this was soon shortened to M-1. The M-1 used the same Liberty engine as the DH.4, which was available in large numbers. Small modifications were made to the exhaust system to keep fumes away from the pilot and the design was considered a success, but was not ordered into production. When the Contract Air Mail (CAM) routes were introduced, the newly formed Western Air Express Company (later Western Airlines) ordered six mailplanes with the designation M-2. The main change from the M-1 was that the tunnel radiator was replaced with a frontal type. It also had the provision to carry a passenger instead of mail in the front cockpit. Just before Western Air Express introduced the aircraft into service (in April 1926 from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City), the Post Office ordered 50 aircraft designated M-3 for its major route network. The M-3 had only detailed differences from the M-2. Douglas then redesigned the M-3 to try to increase the payload, and the new aircraft was designated the M-4. The M-4 had a new longer span wing and the Post Office converted some of the M-3s order to be built as M-4s. One M-4 was also bought by Western Air Express and this was designated the M-4A. When the CAM-3 (Chicago-Dallas) route was passed to National Air Transport Inc (NAT) in October 1925, the airline originally used the Curtiss Carrier Pigeon. When the Post Office retired its aircraft in July 1926 after all the routes had been privatized, NAT bought ten M-3s and eight M-4s at auction. NAT bought other aircraft and at one point had a fleet of 24 Douglas mailplanes in use. Some of the NAT M-3s were modified by them with longer-span wings from 1928 onwards. One M-4 was re-engined by NAT with a Pratt & Whitney Hornet radial engine. With the introduction of three-engined aircraft types beginning in 1928, the Douglas mailplanes were withdrawn from service; some were sold but most were scrapped.

He was also an editor, commentator on William Shakespeare, and critic of dissenter historians. Life Grey was the son of an Anglican priest and graduated from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, getting his LL.B. in 1709 and LL.D. in 1720. He was ordained a priest by the Bishop of London in 1711, and he left Cambridge to take up two livings: Houghton Conquest in Bedfordshire in 1725, and the parish of St Giles' and St Peter's in Cambridge. He served in Cambridge during the winter months and lived most of the year in the town of Ampthill, which put him near Houghton Conquest. Grey had a first marriage that ended quickly, and then he married Susanna Hatton, daughter of a Cambridge tavern keeper, in 1720, and the couple had two daughters to survive, and both of these married clergy. Grey died in Ampthill in 1766 and was buried at his church in Houghton Conquest. His wife survived him for five years, and, after her death, a large portion of Grey's papers were purchased by John Nichols. Works Grey was an extensive collector of pamphlets from the Republican side in the English Civil War, and he used this reading to combat, often with great hostility, Puritan historians and ministers. In 1720, he wrote A Vindication of the Church of England, against James Peirce, and in 1722 he wrote Presbyterian Prejudice Display'd. In reply to Jean Barbeyrac, he wrote The Spirit of Infidelity Detected, which he republished in 1735. These works were aimed primarily at rebutting the adversaries of the Established Church, as well as at vilifying Puritanism. In 1723, Grey also began countering historians whose accounts of the Civil War praised the Republican side. He produced a volume reproducing many of the sermons of Puritan ministers during the Long Parliament in A Century of Eminent Presbyterian Preachers. This was written to target Edmund Calamy, but Grey countered John Oldmixon as well. His most consistent opponent, however, was Daniel Neal, and Grey wrote a series of pamphlets from 1723 - 1739 attacking Neal. He also countered Sir Isaac Newton's work with Examination of the 14th chapter of Sir Isaac Newton's observations upon the prophecies of Daniel. Grey showed the shallowness of Newton's biblical scholarship and accused him of Arianism. Finally, in 1744 Grey's A Review of Mr. Daniel Neal's History of the Puritans concluded the battle with Neal. For Grey, all of these historians, including Newton, were glorifying the regicides, whom Grey considered murderers, and trying to swing the public mood back to 1649. The stakes, therefore, were very high. Grey's anti-Puritanism showed in his more literary efforts as well. In 1744, he produced an edition of Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Because of his elaborate background knowledge of the period of the Civil War, Grey's edition featured a vast array of notes and other apparatus to make the identifications in the poem explicit and to portray Butler's targets in the most unflattering light. However, this edition engendered a new quarrel. William Warburton had supplied some notes for the edition to a mutual friend, and Warburton claimed that the notes were used without explicit permission, and Warburton said that the edition was an \\"execrable heap of nonsense.\\" Grey fought back against Warburton. He issued three pamphlet replies, and in 1747 he produced Remarks upon a Late Edition of Shakespeare in response to Warburton's Shakespear. In it, he accused Warburton of sabotaging Thomas Hanmer's edition (a charge hinted at in Pope's Dunciad), and in 1750 he wrote A free and familiar letter to that great refiner of Pope and Shakespear to again attack Warburton's edition. That same year, he also wrote A Chronological and Historical Account of the most Remarkable Earthquakes, which he expanded two years later, with a theme of the transience of life and the need for devotion. Grey produced his own edition of Shakespeare in 1754, in the two volume Critical, Historical, and Explanatory Notes on Shakespeare. Grey's position on Shakespeare was in line with that of Lewis Theobald and Thomas Hamner, and his goal in the Notes was to show how Shakespeare used his historical sources faithfully.

It is set in 1930s Helsinki and centers on Inspector Palmu's investigation of the murder of rich and decadent Bruno Rygseck. It is based on Mika Waltari's 1940 , and was the first film adaptation of his Inspector Palmu novels. The film was followed by three sequels, Kaasua, komisario Palmu! (1961), T√§hdet kertovat, komisario Palmu (1962) and Vodkaa, komisario Palmu (1969), which were produced by a different studio, Fennada-Filmi, but directed by Kassila and featured the same core cast. It has enjoyed great popularity over the years, and in 2012, it was voted the best Finnish film of all time by Finnish film critics, journalists and bloggers in a poll organized by Yle Uutiset. Plot The film opens with a scene of guests arriving at the crime- themed dinner party of Bruno Rygseck, the rich and decadent heir of the Ryk√§m√∂ concern. The guests are his cousins Airi and Aimo Ryk√§m√∂, Airi's fianc√© Erik Vaara, who works for the concern and strongly dislikes Bruno, and Irma Vanne, the daughter of vuorineuvos Vanne.

The second building from the left was used for the exterior shots of Bruno Rygseck's townhouse. The next morning, inspector Palmu and detectives Virta and Kokki are informed that Bruno has drowned in his indoor swimming pool after slipping on a bar of soap. They head to the Rygseck house to conduct a routine investigation. The party guests (with the exception of Vanne), as well as Bruno's aunt Amalia Rygseck and his estranged wife Alli Rygseck, are present at the house, as all of them had had something to discuss with Bruno that morning. As Palmu inspects the bathroom, he begins to suspect that Bruno was in fact murdered. When the policemen are shown around the house by Bruno's manservant, Veijonen, they find Vanne and famous author K.V. Laihonen engrossed in lively conversation in the basement. They are oblivious to the morning's events, as they had entered the house through the back door when coke was delivered in the early morning and have since been in the basement. Although Laihonen does not know Bruno or Vanne from before, he had been invited to the house by her to get back the stolen manuscript of his unpublished novel. The atmosphere in the house becomes increasingly hostile towards the investigation as Palmu asks more detailed questions about the morning's events. He learns that the previous night, Aimo had stolen Amalia's cat and brought it with him to the dinner party, where Bruno had poisoned it and invited her to view the cadaver for his amusement. Despite Palmu's suspicions, the investigation is closed due to pressure from the powerful Rygsecks and because there is no evidence to prove that the death was not accidental. Laihonen asks the policemen and Vanne to join him at the luxurious Hotel K√§mp for a late lunch. At K√§mp, Vanne tells the policemen more about the previous night. They had been playing a game in which each contestant has to commit a crime that the victim cannot report to the police. The winner was to be chosen by Vaara at the party. Her crime had been to steal the manuscript; Aimo's to steal the cat; and Airi's to have ten of Aimo's promissory notes signed by Bruno. She had refused to reveal how she had gotten them, other than that it was blackmail. Bruno had then asked Vaara to come to his bedroom in order to show him his crime in private. Afterwards, Vaara had stormed out of the house in fury, after stating that Bruno had won the contest. When Palmu and the detectives arrive back at the police station late in the afternoon, they are told that Alli Rygseck has been poisoned with prussic acid mixed in her absinthe. She had been back at the Rygseck house to discuss with the family members who was to inherit from Bruno: she had insisted that she should get the house. Bruno's case is now also re-opened, and the policemen head back to the house. Palmu interrogates Airi about the promissory notes, and she reveals that Aimo had been forging Bruno's signature to pay off his gambling debts. Bruno had told her that he would contact the police about it unless she were to agree to do something, although she refuses to specify exactly what. In Bruno's bedroom, Palmu finds an album of nude photographs he had taken of his female friends, with one page torn off. That evening, the policemen meet Bruno's uncle Gunnar Rygseck, the head of the Ryk√§m√∂ concern, at his office. He tries to bribe Palmu and claims that Bruno was suicidal and had intended the poisoned absinthe for himself before dying accidentally. Next, Palmu confronts Vaara, whose office is in the same building, about what Bruno showed him. It is revealed to have been a nude photograph of Airi, which Palmu notices is a forgery. He tells Vaara that Aimo killed Bruno and that Airi will be imprisoned as an accomplice as she has tried to protect her brother: this leads Vaara to confess to Bruno's murder. Palmu asks for Airi, who also works for the concern, to come to Vaara's office. She confirms that the photograph is forged, and finds the idea that her brother killed Bruno laughable. Vaara takes back his confession, and Palmu admits that he never truly believed either him or Aimo to be the murderer. Palmu calls the Rygseck house, where Amalia is moving in, and is told by her that Veijonen has disappeared. Palmu goes to interrogate Vanne again, and she confesses to have in fact secretly stayed in Alli Rygseck's old bedroom on the night of the party. When she walked through the corridor leading to the bathroom the next morning in order to get to the back door, she thought that a stair creaked behind her, as if someone else was there as well. Palmu places her on house arrest at Laihonen's apartment. In order to get the murderer to act, Palmu sends detective Virta to tell all the suspects that Vanne knows something about the murders. He is also to get Bruno's photo album from the Rygseck house and to go show it to Vanne. At the house, Amalia convinces Virta to give her his gun for protection as she is scared of Veijonen. When Virta returns to the station, he learns that Veijonen has been caught and is cleared of the murders. Soon after, Palmu calls Laihonen and asks to speak to Vanne. He admits that she has gone to help Amalia search the house ‚Äì he had lied to the gullible Virta earlier that she was asleep. The police rush back to the Rygseck house, and stop Amalia from shooting Vanne. In the struggle, Virta is shot in the shoulder. In the final scene, it is revealed that Amalia has been mentally ill for some time and that she murdered Bruno as revenge for killing her cat. The murder weapon was her umbrella with a sturdy wooden handle that she always carried with her. As she is elderly and not of sound mind, she is not prosecuted but is left to the care of her brother.

The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli and stars Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, and Cyd Charisse. Brigadoon has been broadcast on American television and is available in VHS, DVD and Blu Ray formats. Plot Americans Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) and Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) are on a hunting trip in Scotland and become lost in the woodlands. They happen upon Brigadoon, a miraculously blessed village that rises out of the mists every hundred years for only a day. (This was done so that the village would never be changed or destroyed by the outside world.) Tommy falls in love with village lass Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse), whose younger sister Jean (Virginia Bosler), is about to be married to Charlie Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson). When Tommy and Jeff happen upon clues about the village and its people that make no sense, Fiona takes them to see Mr. Lundie (Barry Jones), the village schoolmaster, who tells them the story of Brigadoon and the miracle. If any villager ever leaves Brigadoon, the spell will be broken and the village will vanish forever. Furthermore, Lundie tells them, any outsider who wishes to stay must love someone in the village strongly enough to accept the loss of everything he or she knew in the outside world. That evening, Mr. Lundie officiates at the wedding of Jean and Charlie, which Tommy and Fiona attend. Interrupting the wedding, the jealous Harry Beaton (Hugh Laing) announces he is leaving Brigadoon to make everything disappear, since the girl he loves, Jean, is marrying another man. Harry's words cause mass chaos among the townspeople and they all rush to stop him. Harry almost crosses the bridge but is stopped short by Tommy. They scuffle and Tommy is knocked unconscious. With men closing in on him, Harry climbs up a tree to hide but is accidentally gunned down by Jeff, who skipped the wedding to go hunting. Harry falls dead to the ground and is soon found by the men. Fiona frantically searches for and finds Tommy. Confessing their love for each other, they decide to marry, allowing Tommy to stay in Brigadoon for good. But while Fiona goes off to find Mr. Lundie, Tommy tells Jeff about his plan. Jeff, drunk and remorseful of accidentally killing Harry, tells Tommy he can't just leave everything in the real world behind for this girl he's only known a day. Fiona returns with Mr. Lundie, but Tommy confesses that he cannot stay. Fiona says she understands but is heartbroken and they say good-bye before Brigadoon completely disappears. Tommy and Jeff cross the bridge and walk away. Back in New York City, Tommy can think only of Fiona. Unable even to talk with his fianc√©e, Tommy ends his relationship with her and calls Jeff, telling him to get the first flight back to Scotland. He and Jeff return to the same spot where they were lost, though Jeff reminds him again the village will not be there. But suddenly Tommy sees lights start to appear through the mist and runs toward them. Brigadoon reappears and Tommy gets to the foot of the bridge to see Mr. Lundie half-awake on the other side saying: \\"Tommy, lad, you! My, my, you must really love her. You woke me up.\\" Tommy seems stunned that Brigadoon has been brought back, but Mr. Lundie reminds him: \\"I told ye, if you love someone deeply enough, anything is possible ... even miracles.\\" Tommy then runs across the bridge and reunites with Fiona as the village fades back into the mist.

Arthur Rank acquired the rights of the official play in February 1951. According to the press, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \\"paid a fortune\\" for the rights,\\"Gene Kelly, Kathryn Grayson Named Stars For Movie, 'Brigadoon by Louella Parsons, Deseret News, March 12, 1951, p. 3 and Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson were named in the leads a month later. By the time they were cast, a script was not written yet, although it was reported that Alan Jay Lerner was expected to start on the script a week later. Furthermore, Alec Guinness was also set for a role and David Wayne, Moira Shearer and Donald O'Connor were under consideration for one. According to the film's director, Vincente Minnelli, O'Connor competed with Steve Allen and Bill Hayes for the role of 'Jeff'. Cyd Charisse replaced Grayson in March 1953. Elaine Stewart was cast in the fourth lead in November 1953, and it was reported that she was more enthusiastic about working with Minnelli than with Kelly.\\"Elaine Stewart Gets Role In 'Brigadoon' On Screen\\" by Dorothy Manners, St. Petersburg Times, November 17, 1953, p. 36 Because of Kelly's commitments to other film projects, production was delayed for a while, and it did not begin until 1953. Initially, Minnelli and Kelly wanted to film on location in Scotland. Unfortunately, an unpredictable climate and higher location production costs (the latter not compatible with MGM President Dore Schary's thriftiness), forced them to change course. Kelly and producer Arthur Freed traveled to Scotland to confirm for themselves if the weather was too unreliable, and they agreed with the studio. In Kelly's biography it was stated that \\"the weather was so bad that we had to agree with the studio. So we came back to the United States and started looking for locations here. We found some highlands above Monterey [in Big Sur] that looked like Scotland. But then the studio had an economy wave, and they clamped the lid on that idea.\\" Much to the disappointment of the cast and crew and the delight of Dore Schary, filming had to take place on the sound stages at MGM instead. Dancer-actor James Mitchell had originated the part of Harry Beaton in the original 1947 Broadway production of Brigadoon and scored a great success. When the film began shooting in 1953, Mitchell was already under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and had just completed work on the Fred Astaire musical film The Band Wagon which was directed by Vincente Minnelli and co-starred Cyd Charisse. However, rather than have Mitchell reprise his stage role, the studio instead cast New York City Ballet dancer Hugh Laing as Harry Beaton. In December 1954, a few months after the release of Brigadoon, Mitchell and Charisse made a cameo appearance dancing with each other to the song \\"One Alone\\" in the M-G-M Sigmund Romberg musical biography film Deep in My Heart. In addition, rather than being filmed in the expensive original three-strip Technicolor process with the 1.33:1 square-frame aspect ratio, the film was shot in single-strip Metrocolor and utilized CinemaScope, the newly patented 20th Century Fox 2.55:1 anamorphic widescreen process.

The Breen office refused to allow the use of the two songs the Meg Brockie character sang in the stage version (\\"The Love of My Life\\" and \\"My Mother's Wedding Day\\"Lyrics to My Mother's Wedding Day), as the lyrics were considered too risqu√© for general audiences. With the omission of these songs, the supporting role of Meg Brockie was reduced in the film to scarcely more than a bit part. The minor song \\"Jeannie's Packin' Up\\" was also omitted. Some of this was done because, after listening to Gene Kelly's pre-recordings of \\"There But For You Go I\\" and \\"From This Day On\\", the makers of the film felt that the results did not show his voice to its best advantage, but some was done because producer Arthur Freed wanted to shape the two-and-a-half hour stage musical into a film that ran 108 minutes. Complete sound and picture footage of three of the deleted musical numbers has survived, and it is included in the latest DVD release of the film. The 1954 original motion picture soundtrack was originally incomplete, but was re-released with deleted songs, alternative takes, and undubbed vocals. Reception Bosley Crowther in The New York Times of September 17, 1954, described the film as \\"curiously flat and out-of-joint, rambling all over creation and seldom generating warmth or charm.\\" Crowther admired the costumes, sets, and decor but deplored the omission of several musical numbers. He found fault with the film's two stars and its director: \\"the personable Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse have the lead dancing roles. Even so, their several individual numbers are done too slickly, too mechanistically. What should be wistful and lyric smack strongly of trickery and style ... Mr. Kelly's [performance] is as thin and metallic as a nail; Miss Charisse's is solemn and posey ... Vincente Minnelli's direction lacks his usual vitality and flow.\\" He concluded by noting the film was \\"pretty weak synthetic Scotch.\\"The New York Times Review Variety posted a lukewarm review, calling the dance staging \\"not particularly arresting, although a few of the numbers will have a desired effect on the audience, and the vocals fail to give the tunes the tonal impact needed to put them over.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote of the film: \\"It has much to recommend it from the viewpoint of the production values, and there are individual musical sequences that are nimble, gay, and cheery, but some of the other production numbers are long drawn out and tedious, and on the whole the picture's fantasy theme misses fire.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote: \\"There are times in this version of 'Brigadoon' when one is seized by the wild hope that the exposition of the town's dilemma will be quickly boiled down to an essence, so that Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse can get on with their dancing. The problems of the community are always getting in the way though ... I rather regretted that they weren't able to cut loose with their musical paces more often.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called the film \\"a sizeable disappointment. Overloaded with Hollywood-Scottish trappings, with tartans, bagpipes and a wedding celebration preceded by a miniature sort of gathering of the clans, the tenuous romantic fantasy is slackly developed ... and the whimsical dream-world it creates holds no compelling attractions.\\" Leonard Maltin in his reappraisal feels this adaptation was unfairly overlooked when it first appeared and particularly praises the \\"lovely\\" score, orchestrated mainly by Conrad Salinger, and the performance of Van Johnson as Jeff Douglas. Box office According to MGM records the film earned $1,982,000 in the US and Canada and $1,293,000 and resulted in a loss of $1,555,000.

Svartsj√∂ Palace (, \\"Black Lake Castle\\") is a Rococo palace situated in Svartsj√∂ on the island of F√§rings√∂ in lake M√§laren. It lies just outside of Stockholm. History Approximate location of earlier castle as it relates to the new palace and existing ruins. Renaissance era, Svartsj√∂ Palace had a round court surrounded by arcades in two stories. The main building was a large cube crowned by a cupola and small towers. Engraving from Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna. =Royal residence= The location of this palace has housed several royal buildings. During medieval times there was a stone house where prominent Swedish royalty lived. Gustav Vasa and his sons Erik and Johan erected a lavish renaissance palace with a round inner courtyard. It was at least partly designed by Willem Boy and completed in 1580 but burnt down in 1687. The remaining building material was shipped to Stockholm to be used in the build of the castle Tre kronor. The stone foundation was left and is visible today. The current buildings middle section was started in 1734 and finished in 1739 on the order of Fredrik I. It was built as a hunting palace for then current queen Ulrika Eleonora using drawings by Carl H√•rleman. The now Rococo palace, raised by inspiration of French palaces, became a model for Swedish country mansion architecture during the later part of the 18th century. The palace was extended on both short ends by drawings of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, together with a bell tower. It was given to the Queen dowager Louisa Ulrika of Prussia as a residence for her widowhood in 1771. The palace was abandoned for over a hundred years after the death of Lovisa Ulrika in 1782. =The prison period= Reconstructed prison cells Due to the large areas of minable granite in the area the palace was transformed in 1891 into a prison. Prisoners mined the granite until 1910, when a successful trial with farming and logging proved to work better for the prison. As more violent criminals were admitted to Svartsj√∂ Palace, a special closed section was created with 337 cells built with steel walls. In 1966 the palace ceased to be used as a prison, and the prison walls were torn down. The prison warden house still remains in the palace gardens, as well as several prison personnel houses in the nearby area. Modern restoration After years of neglect the palace was restored from 1994 to 2003 by the state, to a cost of 36 million SEK. The fa√ßade has regained its light shade, made to resemble French sandstone. The windows are painted in a gold brown oak color. None of the original wallpaper was kept but wallpaper based on nearby Drottningholm Palace was used.

Before the arrival of the Spanish, an early civilization lived in the area, The Sican. The Sican culture existed long before the Incas, and adopted themselves to the geography of Ferre√±afe. The Sican built pyramids and buried their family lineage in forms that attract scholars from different fields of study. Sican National Museum is the main centre of interpretation to understand the culture, philosophy, architecture, life style, and hierarchy structure of the Sican. Through the years, Ferre√±afanos have learned to preserve its customs and values. Until these days, its populations strongly preserves its beliefs in Catholicism, and Shamanism as well, naming Ferre√±afe the city of \\"the double faith\\". The Sican, the Incas, The Spanish, and more recently Chinese, Japanese, among other immigration groups, have brought development in many domains, one of them Gastronomy, known as Peruvian cuisine. Years of history, have brought along a developed taste for food and its ingredients. In fact, some ingredients are native from Ferre√±afe as are portrayed in the pottery by early pre-Columbus civilization, the Sican. Ingredients such as Loche, Lucuma, among others. There exists a cotton that grows in several different natural colours, and is originally from Ferre√±afe, named \\"algodon nativo\\". Textiles are also produced by locals in the small towns nearby the Andes. The town has potential for agrotourism and adventure tourism, while enjoying the night life during the weekends. Birdwatching is a growing activity that can be widely practiced in the surrounding area. In recent years, the tourism industry has occupied an important role in its economy, that was until few years ago based only in agriculture. Few hotels are available, and there is still lack of proper training for the human resources of the tourism industry.

Early life and military career Franz was born at Schloss Leutstetten, Starnberg, Bavaria. He was the third son of King Ludwig III of Bavaria and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresia of Austria-Este. Initially, Franz served as a commander of the 2. Infanterie-Regiments K√∂nig, but shortly before the outbreak of World War I, he was given command of the 3. bayerische Infanteriebrigade, which was later renamed and became the 4. Infanterie- Brigade. Prince Franz led this brigade through its victories at Fort Douaumont, Passchendaele and Kemmelberg. For his exemplary leadership during these operations he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph on 25 May 1916 and on 28 October 1916 was given command of the entire 4. Bayerische Infanterie-Division. In Spring 1918, Prince Franz was also awarded the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph and the prestigious Pour le M√©rite, Prussia's highest military decoration, on 16 May 1918. However, during the summer 1918, the 4. Bayerische Infanterie-Division suffered severe loses during the Battle of the Somme and was transferred to Italian Front on border protection duties, where he stayed for the remainder of the war. Marriage On 12 July 1912 Prince Franz married Princess Isabella Antonie of Cro√ø, the daughter of Duke Karl Alfred of Cro√ø and Princess Ludmilla of Arenberg. The wedding took place at the Schloss Weilburg in Baden near Vienna, Austria-Hungary. The couple had six children: * Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (1913‚Äì2008); married Princess Irmingard of Bavaria (1923‚Äì2010). * Princess Maria Elisabeth of Bavaria (1914‚Äì2011); married Prince Pedro Henrique of Orl√©ans-Braganza (1909‚Äì1981). * Princess Adelgunde Maria of Bavaria (1917‚Äì2004); married Baron Zdenko von Hoenning-O'Carroll (1906‚Äì1996). * Princess Eleonore Marie of Bavaria (1918‚Äì2009); married Count Konstantin of Waldburg-Zeil (1909‚Äì1972). * Princess Dorothea Therese of Bavaria (1920‚Äì2015); married Archduke Gottfried of Austria (1902‚Äì1984). * Prince Rasso of Bavaria (1926‚Äì2011); married Princess Theresa of Bavaria (b. 1931). Death Prince Franz of Bavaria died on 25 January 1957 at Schloss Leutstetten in Starnberg, Bavaria and is buried in the Colombarium in the Michaelskirche in Munich, Bavaria.

Typically a qualified aquatic therapist gives constant attendance to a person receiving treatment in a heated therapy pool. Aquatic therapy techniques include Ai Chi, Aqua Running, Bad Ragaz Ring Method, Burdenko Method, Halliwick, Watsu, and other aquatic bodywork forms. Therapeutic applications include neurological disorders, spine pain, musculoskeletal pain, postoperative orthopedic rehabilitation, pediatric disabilities, and pressure ulcers.  Overview  Aquatic therapy refers to water-based treatments or exercises of therapeutic intent, in particular for relaxation, fitness, and physical rehabilitation. Treatments and exercises are performed while floating, partially submerged, or fully submerged in water. Many aquatic therapy procedures require constant attendance by a trained therapist, and are performed in a specialized temperature-controlled pool. Rehabilitation commonly focuses on improving the physical function associated with illness, injury, or disability.Becker, BE and Cole, AJ (eds). 2011. Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . Aquatic therapy encompasses a broad set of approaches and techniques, including aquatic exercise, physical therapy, aquatic bodywork, and other movement-based therapy in water (hydrokinesiotherapy). Treatment may be passive, involving a therapist or giver and a patient or receiver, or active, involving self- generated body positions, movement, or exercise. Examples include Halliwick Aquatic Therapy, Bad Ragaz Ring Method, Watsu, and Ai chi. For orthopedic rehabilitation, aquatic therapy is considered to be synonymous with therapeutic aquatic exercise, aqua therapy, aquatic rehabilitation, water therapy, and pool therapy. Aquatic therapy can support restoration of function for many areas of orthopedics, including sports medicine, work conditioning, joint arthroplasty, and back rehabilitation programs. A strong aquatic component is especially beneficial for therapy programs where limited or non- weight bearing is desirable and where normal functioning is limited by inflammation, pain, guarding, muscle spasm, and limited range of motion (ROM). Water provides a controllable environment for reeducation of weak muscles and skill development for neurological and neuromuscular impairment, acute orthopedic or neuromuscular injury, rheumatological disease, or recovery from recent surgery.Koury JM. 1996. Aquatic therapy programming: guidelines for orthopedic rehabilitation. Human Kinetics. . Various properties of water contribute to therapeutic effects, including the ability to use water for resistance in place of gravity or weights; thermal stability that permits maintenance of near-constant temperature; hydrostatic pressure that supports and stabilizes, and that influences heart and lung function; buoyancy that permits flotation and reduces the effects of gravity; and turbulence and wave propagation that allow gentle manipulation and movement.Becker, BE. 2011. Biophysical aspects of hydrotherapy. pp 23-75. Chapter 2 In Becker, BE and Cole, AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. .  History  The use of water for therapeutic purposes first dates back to 2400 B.C. in the form of hydrotherapy, with records suggesting that ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Mohammedan cultures utilized mineral waters which were thought to have curative properties through the 18th century. In 1911, Dr. Charles Leroy Lowman began to use therapeutic tubs to treat cerebral palsy and spastic patients in California at Orthopedic Hospital in Los Angeles. Lowman was inspired after a visit to Spaulding School for Crippled Children in Chicago, where wooden exercise tanks were used by paralyzed patients. The invention of the Hubbard Tank, developed by Leroy Hubbard, launched the evolution of modern aquatic therapy and the development of modern techniques including the Halliwick Concept and the Bad Ragaz Ring Method (BRRM). Throughout the 1930s, research and literature on aquatic exercise, pool treatment, and spa therapy began to appear in professional journals. Dr. Charles Leroy Lowman's Technique of Underwater Gymnastics: A Study in Practical Application, published in 1937, introduced underwater exercises that were used to help restore muscle function lost by bodily deformities. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis began utilizing corrective swimming pools and Lowman's techniques for treatment of poliomyelitis in the 1950s. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) recognized the aquatic therapy section within the APTA in 1992, after a vote within the House of Delegates of the APTA in Denver, CO after lobbying efforts spearheaded starting in 1989 by Judy Cirullo and Richard C. Ruoti.  Techniques  Techniques for aquatic therapy include the following: *Ai Chi: Ai Chi, developed in 1993 by Jun Konno, uses diaphragmatic breathing and active progressive resistance training in water to relax and strengthen the body, based on elements of qigong and Tai chi chuan.Lambeck J and Bommer A. 2011. Ai Chi: applications in clinical practice. pp 171-192, Chapter 7 In: Becker, BE and Cole, AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . *Aqua running: Aqua running (Deep Water Running or Aquajogging) is a form of cardiovascular conditioning, involving running or jogging in water, useful for injured athletes and those who desire a low-impact aerobic workout. Aqua running is performed in deep water using a floatation device (vest or belt) to support the head above water.Wilder, RP and Brennan DK. 2011. Aqua running. pp 155-170, Chapter 6 In: Becker BE and Cole AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . *Bad Ragaz Ring Method: The Bad Ragaz Ring Method (BRRM) focuses on rehabilitation of neuromuscular function using patterns of therapist-assisted exercise performed while the patient lies horizontal in water, with support provided by rings or floats around the neck, arms, pelvis, and knees. BRRM is an aquatic version of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) developed by physiotherapists at Bad Ragaz, Switzerland, as a synthesis of aquatic exercises designed by a German physician in the 1930s and land-based PNF developed by American physiotherapists in the 1950s and 1960s.Ainslie T. 2012.

The Bad Ragaz Ring Method. pp 109-136, Chapter 4 In: Becker BE and Cole AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . *Burdenko Method: The Burdenko Method, originally developed by Soviet professor of sports medicine Igor Burdenko, is an integrated land-water therapy approach that develops balance, coordination, flexibility, endurance, speed, and strength using the same methods as professional athletes. The water-based therapy uses buoyant equipment to challenge the center of buoyancy in vertical positions, exercising with movement in multiple directions, and at multiple speeds ranging from slow to fast.Audette JF and Bailey A. 2008. Integrative pain medicine: the science and practice of complementary and alternative medicine in pain management. Humana Press. . *Halliwick Concept: The Halliwick Concept, originally developed by fluid mechanics engineer James McMillan in the late 1940s and 1950s at the Halliwick School for Girls with Disabilities in London, focuses on biophysical principles of motor control in water, in particular developing sense of balance (equilibrioception) and core stability. The Halliwick Ten-Point-Program implements the concept in a progressive program of mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and applies the program to teach physically disabled people balance control, swimming, and independence. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), implements the concept in patient-specific aquatic therapy.Lambeck J and Gamper U. 2011. The Halliwick Concept. pp 77-108, Chapter 3 In: Becker BE and Cole AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. .Dutton M. 2011.

The concise guide to physiotherapy - 2-volume set: Assessment and Treatment. pp 1106-1116, Halliwick Concept. Elsevier Health Sciences. . *Watsu: Watsu is a form of aquatic bodywork, originally developed in the early 1980s by Harold Dull at Harbin Hot Springs, California, in which an aquatic therapist continuously supports and guides the person receiving treatment through a series of flowing movements and stretches that induce deep relaxation and provide therapeutic benefit. In the late 1980s and early 1990s physiotherapists began to use Watsu for a wide range of orthopedic and neurologic conditions, and to adapt the techniques for use with injury and disability.Schoedinger P. 2011. Watsu in aquatic rehabilitation. pp 137-154, Chapter 5 In: Becker BE and Cole AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. .  Applications and effectiveness  Applications of aquatic therapy include neurological disorders,Morris DM. 2011.

Spine pain: aquatic rehabilitation strategies. pp 219-244, Chapter 9 In: Becker BE and Cole AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . musculoskeletal pain, postoperative orthopedic rehabilitation, pediatric disabilities, and pressure ulcers. A 2006 systematic review of effects of aquatic interventions in children with neuromotor impairments found \\"substantial lack of evidence-based research evaluating the specific effects of aquatic interventions in this population\\". For musculoskeletal rehabilitation, aquatic therapy is typically used to treat acute injuries as well as subjective pain of chronic conditions, such as arthritis. Water immersion has compressive effects and reflexively regulates blood vessel tone. Muscle blood flow increases by about 225% during immersion, as increased cardiac output is distributed to skin and muscle tissue. Flotation is able to counteract the effects of gravitational force on joints, creating a low impact environment for joints to perform within. The temperature changes, increase in systolic blood pressure to extremities, and overall increase in ambulation are factors which help immersion to alleviate pain. Aquatic Therapy helps with pain and stiffness, but can also improve quality of life, tone the muscles in the body, and can help with movement in the knees and hips. Protocols using a combination of strengthening, flexibility, and balance exercises resulted in the greatest improvements in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire scores, whereas aerobic exercise did not result in greater improvements in CHAQ scores compared to a comparison group performing Qigong. Not only does aquatic therapy help with pain, but can benefit postural stability, meaning it can help to strengthen balance functions especially with people who have neurological disorders. For people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, aquatic exercise has been proven to be more beneficial than land-based exercise for two important outcome measures. The Berg Balance Scale and Falls Efficacy Scale score were reported to have significant improvement when implementing aquatic exercise over land-based exercise. These results suggest that aquatic exercise can be extremely helpful for Parkinson's disease patients with specific balance disorders and fear of falling. From a cardiopulmonary standpoint, aquatic therapy is often used because its effects mirror land-based effects but at lower speeds. During immersion, blood is displaced upwards into heart and there is an increase in pulse pressure due to increased cardiac filling. Cardiac volume increases 27-30%. Oxygen consumption is increased with exercise, and heart rate is increased at higher temperatures, and decreased at lower temperatures. However, immersion can worsen effects in cases of valvular insufficiency due to this cardiac and stroke volume increase. The aquatic environment is also not recommended for those who experience severe or uncontrolled heart failure.  Professional training and certification  Aquatic therapy is performed by diverse professionals with specific training and certification requirements. An aquatic therapy specialization is an add-on certification for healthcare providers, mainly including physical therapists and athletic trainers. For medical purposes, aquatic therapy, as defined by the American Medical Association (AMA), can be performed by various legally-regulated healthcare professionals who have scopes of practice that permit them to offer such services and who are permitted to use AMA Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.Salzman, AP. 2007. Aquatic therapy: procedure or profession? Aquaticnet.com web site. http://www.aquaticnet.com/qualifications.htm, accessed 20-Mar-2014. Currently, aquatic therapy certification is provided by the Aquatic Therapy and Rehab Institute (ATRI), which aims to further education for therapists and healthcare professionals working in aquatic environments. The ATRI prerequisites for certification include 15 hours of Aquatic Therapy, Rehab and/or Aquatic Therapeutic Exercise education, which can be completed hands-on or online. Once completing the prerequisites, those pursuing certification can take the Aquatic Therapy & Rehab Institutes Aquatic Therapeutic Exercise Certification exam.

During its run, The Far East published approximately 750 photographs, mostly of Japan and China, by at least 20 different photographers.Bennett, PiJ, 146. Before J. R. Black began publication of The Far East, he had been partner in and editor of the Japan Herald, the first English-language newspaper in Japan. When that newspaper declared bankruptcy in 1867,Bennett, PiJ, 147. Black founded his own newspaper, the Japan Gazette, which offered coverage of the reform movements of the Bakumatsu.Heinz and Miyoko, 135.

Quoted in Heinz and Miyoko, 135. The first issue appeared on 30 May 1870. The in-house photographer for The Far East was the Austrian, Michael Moser, but Black, an amateur photographer himself, supplemented Moser's images with his own.Moser worked for the newspaper until 1873. Bennett, PiJ, 147. Significant photographers whose work also appeared in the newspaper included Uchida Kuichi, the elder Suzuki Shin'ichi,Bennett, OJP, 93. and William Saunders.Bennett, OJP, 95. The Far East began as a fortnightly publication, then, between June 1873 and October 1875, it was published monthly, and from 1876, publication was irregular.Bennett, OJP, 94, 280-281. In 1874, subscription prices were $4 quarterly, $7 semi-annually, and $13 annually.The currency may have been Mexican dollars. Bennett, OJP, 95. By 1876, in response to increased circulation, the prices were slightly reduced.Bennett, OJP, 96. From 1876, The Far East was published in Shanghai, where J. R. Black had settled. Accordingly, the photographic subjects appearing in the newspaper were now predominantly Chinese.Bennett, OJP, 94. By that year, the circulation was probably in the order of 300 readers, and between 1876 and 1878 the maximum circulation was probably between 500 and 1000 readers.

An amateur right-handed batsman who sometimes opened the innings, Burrough played fairly regular first-class cricket for Somerset in the early 1930s, making useful runs and fielding athletically. He was, said his obituary in Wisden, \\"notably enthusiastic\\". He had been at Cambridge University, but appeared there in only one trial match for \\"seniors\\", and never made the first-class cricket side. He was also passed over at Cambridge for hockey, failing to win his university Blue for the sport, though he later played three times for the England team. In 1931, he played cricket regularly for Somerset, though his highest score was only 55 and he averaged just 16 runs per innings. The following year, 1932, he hit centuries against Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, the former ‚Äì 135 in 180 minutes at Kettering ‚Äì remaining the highest score of his career, and his average rose to 27. This record was \\"as good as that of any other member of the team,\\" said Wisden. In 1933, though there were no further centuries, Burrough reached 1000 runs in a season for the only time in his career, finishing with 1007. This was his last season for full-time cricket, although he continued to play fairly regularly until 1939, with two further centuries in 1935 and 1937. After the Second World War, he played just three first-class matches, without success. Like his county captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg, Burrough was a solicitor in Bath. He also played for Bath Cricket Club.

Akbarpura is named after the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who camped there before going to Afghanistan. It was known originally as Sapalikhera. Akbarpura is noted for its Sufi shrines Baba Saib and Nanga Baba.  Overview and history = Religion = The entire population of Akbarpura is Sunni Muslims. Before the Pakistan-India partition there were several Hindu families residing in the village but most of them left for India after its independence, other Hindu families converted to Islam. = Borders and Population = Akbarpura is one of the densely populated villages in District Nowshera, and serves as a local business hub for the surrounding villages. Some main villages located around Akbarpua are Zakhi Miyana, Zahki Qabristan, Zakhi Kohna, Camp Korona, Zakhi Charbagh, Gari Momin, Jabba, Kandar, Tarkha, Natal, Khoshmakam.

Among these shrines are Akhund Panju Baba, Nanga Baba, Nadan Shaheed. Every day hundreds of people do visits these shrines to pay their respect to the Sufis.

Baba sahib was migrated from Kalu Khan Sawabi area to Akbarpura, he started his teachings and preaching from the Misri Pura area of Akbarpura, where today his tomb is present. Baba Sahib Family is Syed and locally being called as Miangaan which still exists in the area. The main and noted events of the year are the annual Urss of Akhund Panju Baba and Nanga Baba.

Built about 400 years ago, Pokh Jumaat (stone mosque) of Akbarpura has sunk more than four feet since its establishment. Its main hall now requires four steps down for someone to enter. The mosque is subsiding at a rate equivalent to the size of a wheat grain (3 mm) per year according to one local resident. Giving the scientific explanation, Dr Mohammad Iqbal, deputy chief geologist Pakistan Petroleum Limited, says that the mosque is slowly sinking due to the depletion of the water level beneath it. Giant aquifers that serve as water reservoirs are being emptied faster than they can be refilled, causing the earth to sink, he says, adding it seems that it is built on layers of clay and highly permeable sand and gravel that easily compress when fluid is withdrawn. = Education = There are higher secondary school for Boys and girls, several government primary schools, along with four private schools.

Musical style The song was based on a song written by guitarist Jon Hudson, composed in simple MIDI format, hence the heavy electronic sound. Music video The video for \\"Stripsearch\\" was filmed in Berlin during 1997. It was directed by Philipp St√∂lzl, based on a screenplay written by Billy Gould. In the video, Mike Patton walks through parts of the city. At about halfway through he arrives at a military checkpoint and stands at the back of a queue also containing the other members of the band. When he reaches the front, he hands over his passport for inspection. The man inspecting it finds something wrong with the papers and calls the guards on Patton, who tries to get away and is pinned to the floor at gunpoint and arrested. The video then shows still images set earlier in the day, highlighting previously unseen details that point to Patton being a criminal. Reception Tom Phalen of MTV said in 1997 that, \\"despite the inherent brutality of the title, [it] is almost ethereal.\\" NME wrote that the song had \\"smooth trip-hop rhythms\\" and \\"loose, swoozy guitar that sounds like it was recorded in the middle of Monument Valley.\\" In their review of the 2016 deluxe edition for Album of the Year, PopMatters praised the \\"chilled-out paranoia\\" of the song.

Written by band members Billy Gould and Roddy Bottum, the song describes an acquaintance of theirs from New York, and her circle of friends. The single was produced by Matt Wallace and Steve Berlin and released by Slash Records. \\"Anne's Song\\" was released alongside a music video directed by Tamra Davis, which featured both the eponymous Anne and an appearance by Metallica member James Hetfield. The song has met with critical appreciation in later years, drawing comparisons to David Bowie and Tom Tom Club. Production \\"Anne's Song\\" was recorded in 1986 as part of the Introduce Yourself recording sessions, at Studio D in Sausalito, California. The recordings were produced by Matt Wallace and by Slash Records' Steve Berlin. Wallace had worked with the band on their 1985 d√©but album We Care a Lot, and the earlier Faith. No Man single \\"Quiet in Heaven\\"/\\"Song of Liberty\\". He recalled that the more experienced Berlin, having been a member of Los Lobos and primarily accustomed to music unlike Faith No More's, essentially \\"babysat\\" the band to ensure their recording budget was not wasted. The song was written by band members Billy Gould and Roddy Bottum, and features one of the few guitar solos in the band's canon, performed by Jim Martin. The song had existed in a \\"rough and ready\\" incarnation for several months before the recording sessions began, and had its composition completed in the studio. The song's titular Anne is the band's friend Anne D'Angillo, whose residence in Alphabet City, Manhattan was used by the group during their previous tour; the other characters mentioned throughout the song are all real friends of D'Angillo. D'Angillo also featured in the song's music video, shot in New York and Los Angeles by director Tamra Davis; the video also featured shots of singer Chuck Mosley trapped in a cage, tormented by the other band members and Metallica vocalist James Hetfield; bass player Gould conceived of this segment, stating \\"my dream for that video was that I wanted to get Chuck in a cage, from which he couldn't escape, and I could poke him with a stick\\". Release and reception \\"Anne's Song\\" and the accompanying music video were released in April 1988. The single was available in both seven-inch and twelve-inch formats, with the former also available as a picture disc. The video was later included on the 1999 video compilation Who Cares a Lot?: The Greatest Videos; the song itself, however, was not included on the concurrently-released album Who Cares a Lot?. Writing in a review of Introduce Yourself for AllMusic, Greg Prato noted that the song \\"should have been a hit\\", citing its \\"loopy bass and irresistible melodicism\\". The Guardians Jeremy Allen included \\"Anne's Song\\" in his 2014 list of Faith No More's top ten songs, describing it as \\"not unlike a heavier Tom Tom Club in the verses, with a smattering of Mosley‚Äôs hero David Bowie in the chorus\\". Allen felt that \\"Anne's Song\\", along with most of Mosley's work with the band, was \\"more aligned with contemporary music than anything that came after\\". In a Faith No More discography retrospective, Louder Sound wrote that the song \\"really delivers\\", noting Mosley's \\"goofy, purposefully-underachieving vocals\\".

Route description CR 105 heading northbound The road begins at an at-grade interchange with CR 104 in the David Allen Sarnoff Pine Barrens Preservation Area, southwest of Flanders. It immediately curves from an east-west trajectory to a north-south one before its intersection with New York State Route 24 (NY 24). From that point on, the road becomes a semi-limited-access highway as it crosses the Peconic River before running through Riverhead Golf Course and crossing Sawmill Creek. A diamond interchange exists for a park road in Indian Island County Park, followed by a quarter-cloverleaf interchange for Hubbard Avenue near the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. North of NY 25 in Aquebogue, a cloverleaf interchange was planned for the formerly proposed Long Island Expressway Extension. CR 105 replaces Union Avenue south of the intersection with CR 43 (Northville Turnpike) in Northville, only to run along the west side of the former Riverhead Air Park, and finally terminates at Sound Avenue. History CR 105 entrance signage The at-grade interchange with CR 104 was built for one purpose; a future extension into Central Suffolk County. The at-grade interchange was to be upgraded to a real interchange, as was the case with many existing intersections. From there, the road was to run west through the David A. Sarnoff Pine Barrens Preserve, then was to cross over CR 88 (Speonk‚ÄìRiverhead Road), where it was to turn north as it ran along the south and west sides of the Suffolk County Community College Eastern Campus before crossing over CR 51 at Bald Hill. The road was to turn from north back to west as it ran along Hot Water Street and Cranberry Highway, which runs through land that was owned partially by the Calverton Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant. A wye interchange was to exist with CR 90 before terminating at CR 111 (Port Jefferson‚ÄìWesthampton Beach Highway).

Diagnosed with leukemia in early 1973 at age 26, he played four more seasons in the majors and died ten weeks after his final game. Baseball career Born in Wichita, Kansas, Thompson grew up in tiny Capron, Oklahoma, and played college baseball at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he was an All-American. He was the first pick of the Minnesota Twins in the secondary phase of the 1968 amateur draft. Thompson broke into the majors with the Twins in 1970 and had his first full season in 1972; he played for them until June 1976, when he and pitcher Bert Blyleven were traded to the Texas Rangers for four others in a six-player deal. Leukemia Following a routine pre-season physical the day before his 26th birthday, Thompson was called in for additional tests and diagnosed with granulocytic leukemia in early February 1973, but he continued his major league career for the next four seasons. He was awarded baseball's annual Hutch Award in Seattle following the 1974 season, and batted .270 in 1975, leading all American League shortstops. Thompson appeared in 98 games in 1976, and went 1-for-3 in his final start for the Rangers on September 29, appropriately at shortstop in Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium. In his final game on October 2, less than ten weeks before his death, he was used as a pinch hitter. Death Admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on November 16, 1976, Thompson underwent spleen surgery on December 3, and died a week later from complications in Rochester's St. Mary's Hospital. Thompson was 29, leaving behind a wife, Jo, and two young daughters, Tracy and Dana. His funeral was attended by hundreds at the high school gymnasium in Burlington, Oklahoma, and he was buried nearby at the cemetery in his hometown of Capron. Legacy During the 1977 season, members of the Texas Rangers wore a black armband with the No. 4 on their left uniform sleeve. Examples of this tribute can be seen in the 1978 Topps baseball card set. An annual golf tournament honoring Thompson is held in August in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament, benefiting leukemia and cancer research, was launched in 1977 by the Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew (1936‚Äì2011), a former teammate with the Twins; and Ralph Harding (1929‚Äì2006), a former Idaho congressman. The first edition included former President Gerald Ford, Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and Hall of Fame slugger Mickey Mantle. It has donated over $15.6 million since its inception, and is now the \\"Killebrew-Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament\\" (KTM). Killebrew disclosed his esophageal cancer in late 2010 and died five months later at age 74.

They are notable for their jumping ability, complex colony structure, and large to very large workers easily identifiable by their long mandibles and large eyes. Taxonomy Head view of a Harpegnathos saltator worker, showing their characteristic long scythe-shaped mandibles The genus was established by Thomas C. Jerdon in 1851 to house the single species Harpegnathos saltator, found in India. Believing that the name was unavailable due to homonymy, Smith (1858) incorrectly erected the unnecessary replacement name Drepanognathus (now a synonym of Harpegnathos). For some time, both names were used in publications by other authors until the original name was restored. The most recent species was described in 1963, making the total number of Harpegnathos species seven, with an additional four described subspecies. The genus is closely related to the other genera in its tribe, Ponerini, and is probably a sister to all Ponerini. Colony structure Harpegnathos has a complex and different colony structure compared to other genera. In the beginning, young winged queens fly out from their natal colony, mate with foreign males and start new colonies independently. What differs from other ants is that, once the short-lived founding queen dies, several daughter workers replace her as reproductives in the colony. Characteristic of several ponerine species, workers can mate (almost always with foreign males) and store sperm in the spermatheca. In H. saltator, many young workers inbreed with males from the same colony (their brothers). They fight to establish a dominance hierarchy, and a few high-ranking workers become reproductives and lay eggs, so-called gamergates. Every year, new winged queens are reared, and they disperse and start the process again. The combination of queen and gamergate reproduction results in an increased lifespan of colonies, in theory making them immortal.

Edge banding is used to cover the exposed sides of materials such as plywood, particle board or MDF, increasing durability and giving the appearance of a solid or more valuable material. Common substitutes for edgebanding include face frames or molding. Edge banding can be made of different materials including PVC, ABS, acrylic, melamine, wood or wood veneer. Traditional edge banding was a manual process requiring ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, edge banding is applied to the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from .018\\" to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the edge banding is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the edge banding to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge. Thermoplastic Edgebanding is produced with an extruder, a machine that consists of a loading system for raw materials, a screw inside a barrel that melts and transports the raw materials (plastics PVC, ABS, PP, PMMA and color pigments) through a die which shapes the edgebanding into the required size. After the Edgebanding is extruded, it can be texturized, printed, and lacquered to provide the required finish. The Edgebanding is then rolled and send to customers. Leading thermoplastic Edgebanding manufacturers worldwide are Doellken and Rehau with local manufacturers present.

They are evergreen terrestrial and epiphytic plants with unbranched stems, the leaves arranged in two rows along the flowering stem. The flowers appear in succession near the end of the flowering stem with the sepals and petals free from each other. The labellum is like a landing platform and has three lobes. They are native to areas from tropical Asia to northern Australia. Bromheadia finlaysoniana - from Edwards's Botanical Register (1844) Description Plants in the genus Bromheadia are evergreen, terrestrial or epiphytic, sympodial, herbs with leafy stems on a short, creeping rhizome. The leaves are arranged in two rows along an erect, unbranched stem with the flattened, leathery leaves along the upper two- thirds. The flowers are short-lived and appear singly, in succession near the ends of the flowering stem. The flowers are relatively large, resupinate and usually white, creamy yellow or reddish. The sepals are narrower but longer than petals and are often a different colour. The labellum projects forwards and has three lobes with the side lobes erect and there are two pollinia. Taxonomy and naming The genus Bromheadia was first formally described in 1841 by John Lindley and the description was published in Edwards's Botanical Register. The genus name (Bromheadia) honours Edward Bromhead \\"whose investigations of the natural affinities of plants are well known to systematic Botanists.\\" Distribution Orchids in the genus Bromheadia are found in the region stretching from Myanmar and Vietnam south to Java and east to New Guinea and the Philippines, with a few species extending to Sri Lanka and Queensland.  Species  The genus is subdivided into two sections identified by the clear morphological difference in the shape of the leaves: section Bromheadia has dorso-ventrally flattened leaves whereas section Aporodes has laterally-flattened leaves.Kruizinga, J., H.J. van Scheindelen, and E.F. de Vogel. 1997. Revision of the genus Bromheadia (Orchidaceae). Orchid Monographs, 8: 79-118, figures 29-55, plates 4b-5b. While these two sections represent natural groups with clear morphological support, a 1997 phylogenetic study of the relationships within Bromheadia that used only morphological characters and placed Claderia as the outgroup concluded that while section Aporodes was monophyletic, section Bromheadia was paraphyletic. To resolve the conflict, the study's authors suggested that section Bromheadia either absorb section Aporodes to make one large monophyletic genus with no infrageneric subdivisions or to divide section Bromheadia into the three monophyletic groups they identified within it so that the genus would have four sections.Repetur, C.P., P.C. van Welzen, and E.F. de Vogel. 1997. Phylogeny and historical biogeography of the genus Bromheadia (Orchidaceae). Systematic Botany, 22(3): 465-477. However, no further taxonomic work has acted on this suggestion so the genus remains with two natural sections: ;Section Bromheadia *Bromheadia alticola Ridl. *Bromheadia borneensis J.J.Sm. **B. borneensis var. borneensis **B. borneensis var. longiflora Scheind. & de Vogel *Bromheadia crassiflora J.J.Sm. *Bromheadia divaricata Ames & C.Schweinf. *Bromheadia finlaysoniana (Lindl.)

Built in the period of the 1848-1852, it is the mother church of the Diocese of Albany. In 1976 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has several claims to architectural and ecclesiastical history. Designed by Irish American architect Patrick Keely to accommodate Albany's growing population of Catholic immigrants, it is the second-oldest cathedral in the state, after St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. It is also the third oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States, and the first American Catholic cathedral in the Neo-Gothic architectural style.. See embedded audio file, 0:20‚Äì0:24. The interior features the original stained glass windows, imported from England, and award-winning Stations of the Cross statuary. When completed, it was the tallest building in Albany. It has hosted visits by cardinals and leaders of other faiths, including one Archbishop of Canterbury, and the weddings of two Catholic governors' daughters. In 1986 it hosted the first-ever service of forgiveness between Catholics and Jews on Palm Sunday, an event commemorated by a sculpture outside the building. Construction of the cathedral, at the behest of the diocese's first bishop, John McCloskey, took four years. Its south tower took 40, and it was not consecrated until its 50th anniversary in 1902. The construction of Empire State Plaza, the nearby New York state government complex, threatened the cathedral in the 1960s when it required the demolition of most of the surrounding neighborhood. It has been through several renovations in its history, including a $30 million restoration early in the 21st century. Building The cathedral is located in a one-acre () lot on the southwest corner of the intersection of Eagle Street and Madison Avenue (U.S. Route 20). The terrain sloping gently westward from the Hudson River roughly three-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) to the east. It is just outside the Mansion Historic District, also listed on the National Register. Bleecker Park is just across Eagle; beyond it are rowhouses that contribute to that district. Other than that, the surrounding neighborhood consists of large state-government buildings and the spaces around them. To its south a parking lot separates the cathedral and the governor's mansion, another listed property. The remaining nearby buildings are in a more modernist late 20th- century style. On the west, past a plaza with a small fountain, is the large building that houses the New York State Museum, library and archives. Erastus Corning Tower, the centerpiece of Empire State Plaza and the tallest building in upstate New York, rises to the north behind a high retaining wall. East of the cathedral is a parking garage for state government workers. =Exterior= An iron railing along both sidewalks sets off the church building, shaped like a Latin cross, with two side aisles, clerestory and circular chancel at the west (rear) end. Its nave is five bays long, the transept two bays, and the chancel is divided into seven sections. Two towers flank the main entrance. Structurally the nave has vaults dividing its four sections, with secondary ribs and much bossing. The brick walls are faced in sandstone. Slate shingles cover the gabled rolled lead roof. On the east (front) facade are three portals with crocketed gables, divided by four miniature buttresses with crocketed pinnacles. Two larger buttresses, similarly treated, rise to roof level on either side. A large Gothic tracery window is above them, topped by a small recessed quatrefoil window in the gable apex. At the roofline is a pierced tracery parapet. There are small arched tracery windows in the facade's flanks. The towers rise four and a half stories to their spires. At the base they are supported by double-angled buttresses on their corners topped with crocketed pinnacles three stories above. The first two stories have paired windows topped by a small quatrefoil under a pointed dripstone. At the third story this pattern changes to double windows under cusped arches topped by a crocketed ogee arch, above which is a line of plain corbels. The fourth story windows, surrounding the belfry, consist of three narrow louvered arches with a cusped dripstone and gable. On the north tower the top half- story is faced on all sides with a clock while a sexfoil window occupies that position to the south. From a castellated base rise the spires, pierced by small narrow gabled dormers just above the base. Rows of vertical crocketing decorate the section lines. Four more buttresses rise two stories to the roof along the sides of the nave, setting apart Gothic tracery windows. These buttresses, too, are topped with crocketed pinnacles at the castellated roofline. The circular chancel offsets the rectilinearity of the rest of the church. =Interior= The main doors open into a full-width vestibule with flat-beamed ceiling. From it doorways go to the towers and the three aisles of the sanctuary. At its front is a baptismal font of white Caen stone.Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, , retrieved November 13, 2012. Walnut pews sit on a marble patterned floor. alt=A church interior with a tall vaulted ceilings, wooden pews on a stone floor, and stained glass windows The vaulted ceiling is supported by clustered engaged columns with heavy capitals decorated with organic motifs. Among them are many grapes and grape leaves, a particularly Romanesque touch. Heavy bosses connect the ceiling vaults. Modern electric light fixtures are attached to the walls between the arches. The Stations of the Cross are done as small sculptures along the sides. Between them are the stained glass windows, original to the building. In the rear the chancel is lighter, emphasizing its verticality. The altar sits on a raised concrete platform. Each of the seven sections is separated by a single column with a small capital. They have a recessed arched panel with a statue of a saint. Above are lancet windows with more stained glass. On its south is the bishop's cathedra. History The cathedral was built as much for social reasons as the practical needs of the church in an area where its presence had previously been minimal. It took the latter half of the 19th century to complete, and was only consecrated on its 50th anniversary. The building suffered from neglect in the 20th century, and was extensively restored at the beginning of the 21st. =1796‚Äì1847: Catholicism comes to Albany= The small Catholic population that had developed in New York during the 18th century was enough to sustain the entire state as a single parish, primarily concentrated in New York City. St. Mary's Church, formally established in downtown Albany in 1796, was the only Catholic church upstate. Both it and St. Peter's (established in New York City ten years earlier) were part of the Diocese of Baltimore. alt=A black and white photograph of a man with short dark hair wearing a dark buttoned garment around his beck and upper chess with a cross. Below it his lap and robes are visible. In 1808 the Diocese of New York was created. Nine years later, in 1817 Irish immigrants began coming to Albany to build the Erie Canal. The industry that grew around the canal terminus attracted even more immigrants, and the Catholics among them began settling not just in Albany but elsewhere in the Capital District and Mohawk Valley, establishing new churches and subdividing St. Mary's original parish. Immigration from Ireland rose even more in the 1840s due to the Great Famine. By 1847 the Catholic Church and its congregations were well entrenched in Albany and the other cities of the region that Pope Pius IX granted requests to establish the Diocese of Albany. John McCloskey, later Archbishop of New York, was installed as the first bishop of Albany in 1847, with St. Mary's as his procathedral. Like many of the other churches in the new diocese, St. Mary's had been run by a board of trustees due to its distance from the diocesan seat in New York. McCloskey clashed with many of them over their poor financial management, which had left many of them deep in debt. \\"What should belong to the present and the future is already mortgaged to the past!\\" complained McCloskey's superior, John Hughes, Archbishop of New York. Before he had taken up his position in Albany, McCloskey had warned that \\"sooner or later, the trustee system as it exists will destroy or be destroyed by the Catholic religion.\\" =1848‚Äì1852: Construction= To accomplish the latter end and consolidate its bishop's authority, the new diocese needed a dedicated cathedral. There were also broader social reasons. Irish Catholic immigration had led to a nativist backlash, in the form of the Know-Nothing Party, and McCloskey knew that a cathedral in Albany would be an assertion of the immigrants' place in their new country. At the first retreat he presided over, McCloskey persuaded the assembled priests to pledge over five thousand dollars as the seed of a building fund.Farley, 174‚Äì78. alt=A black and white drawing of a church, similar to the cathedral, with two tall pointed towers at the front He commissioned Patrick Keely, an Irish immigrant himself, to design the cathedral, one of 500 churches he would eventually build. Keely was not a design pioneer, but he followed his era's architectural trends closely. For the cathedral he was most influenced by the ideas of British architect Augustus Pugin, as epitomized in Pugin's book True Principles and his St George the Martyr Southwark church in London, both dating to 1841. As a resident of Brooklyn, Keely would also have been familiar with recent American applications of the Gothic Revival style, such as Richard Upjohn's Trinity Church and James Renwick's Grace Church, both Episcopal churches in Manhattan. For Immaculate Conception, he seems to have combined the walls of those two churches with the twin-tower facade of Calvary Church, another Renwick work then under construction. Over 10,000 watched on a rainy July day in 1848 as McCloskey and Hughes laid the church's cornerstone. McCloskey raised funds for the cathedral's construction from not only the rest of the U.S. but the international Catholic community as well. He wrote to both the Leopoldine Society in Austria-Hungary and the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in France. To save time he had the interior done in plaster and lath painted to look like stone. Most of the workers were immigrants; many of them volunteered their time and effort. The final construction cost was $250,000 ($ in modern dollars). Hughes and McCloskey returned to dedicate the cathedral late in 1852, and it opened for services thereafter. =1853‚Äì1902: Completion and consecration= alt=An elaborate, tall and wide stained glass window depicting the life of the Virgin Mary The building was not yet complete, however. On the outside, the spires had not yet been built. Inside, the west side ended in a wall as the chancel had not been added. In it was set the stained glass window depicting the life of the Virgin Mary, known as the Lady Window, which had been imported from England. It had been designed by H.W. Ackroyd of Sheffield and built by William Wailes of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in a 14th-century style. The other stained glass windows were also imported from England, where they were made in Birmingham. Construction continued, and by 1858 the money was available to add one of the spires. The north tower was completed in 1862. Its height made it the city's tallest building for many years. Bells cast at the Meneely Bell Foundry in nearby West Troy (today Watervliet) were hung in the belfry and rung for the first time on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1862. In 1868 the iron fencing around the cathedral was added. Fueled by continued immigration, with Germans and Italians joining the Irish, Albany's Catholic population continued to grow in the later 19th century. A restoration was necessary in 1882. The diocese was able to build the south tower's spire in 1888 and, four years later, the apse and sacristies were added, completing Keeley's design. The interior was also renewed, with the gradual addition of most of the stained glass windows, including the one in the south transept depicting the Last Judgment in 1897. Like many of the interior finishes added during this period, they were European in origin. The choir stalls were carved in Belgium in 1894, and the high pulpit was carved of Dutch oak. alt=Small stone statuary, mounted on a wall, depicting the crucifixion of Jesus The original painted Stations of the Cross were replaced with the current Beaux-Arts sculptures, which had won an award at the Paris Exposition of 1889, in 1900. Two years later, on the 50th anniversary of the cathedral's opening, it was formally consecrated by Bishop Thomas Burke. The same year, the exterior was refaced. =1903‚Äì2008: Neglect= With the cathedral complete, it played its intended role in the city and the church for the first half of the 20th century. Priests were ordained and bishops consecrated there. Visitors included many cardinals, and leaders from other faiths, such as Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury and thus leader of the Church of England. In the 1920s New York elected a Catholic, Al Smith, governor, the first one to be elected to that position in the history of the state. Living in the governor's mansion next door, he became a regular parishioner at the cathedral. In 1928, the year Smith ran unsuccessfully for president, his daughter Catherine was married in the cathedral. In 1936 the buttresses on the north and south aisles were replaced with stronger ones. There was no other significant work on the building otherwise during the first half of the century. In the 1960s, however, the cathedral faced a threat to its existence. Most of the neighborhoods to the north and west that had made up its parish were demolished to clear the way for Empire State Plaza, the modernist complex of state government buildings envisioned by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Only 300 houses remained, and with the resulting diminution of the congregation it was uncertain that the cathedral could survive as an institution‚Äîand as just a building, it faced demolition. Rockefeller and Bishop William Scully worked together to prevent that from happening. Edwin Broderick, Scully's successor, realized that it was not enough to merely save the church. Its age was evident, and it was time to restore it. But he soon realized how extensive the task was, and how costly it would be. It would be limited to new crockets on the towers and, inside, new buttresses for the clerestory. Howard Hubbard took over as bishop in 1977, the first native of the diocese to achieve that position. His interest in ecumenism led to the first-ever Palm Sunday service of reconciliation between Christians and Jews, held at the cathedral in 1986. At the service, called \\"From Fear to Friendship\\" and attended by approximately 1,200 guests, both Christian and Jewish, Hubbard \\"expressed contrition and remorse for the centuries of anti- Jewish hostility promulgated under the Church's auspices\\". Portal, a sculpture that stands just west of the building, commemorates the event. Seven years later, in 1993, the daughter of another Catholic governor and parishioner, Mario Cuomo, was married in the cathedral. =2009‚Äìpresent: Restoration= The building continued to deteriorate. Every winter, a ceiling leak in one corner of the roof would form a icicle, almost reaching the floor. One year in the early 21st century, a large chunk of plaster fell off the ceiling, nearly striking a visiting bishop. Hubbard realized badly needed repair and restoration could no longer be postponed. alt=A closer view of the rear of the church interior seen above, with a golden altar in the foreground He began a campaign to raise money for the work. The estimated cost of everything needed or wanted was $10 million, at first. Ultimately the diocese raised about two- thirds of that amount, and closed the cathedral for a year and a half while rotten structural lumber was replaced, plaster restored, electrical wiring replaced and the walls repainted to, as much as possible, their original colors. The altar was moved closer to the pews and placed on a raised concrete platform, and the baptismal font moved to the rear of the church. The pews themselves were widened and their backs reclined further to make them more comfortable to sit in. On the outside new sandstone from England replaced the deteriorated original on the north tower and clerestory. Granite steps and new sandstone portals were added to the main entrance. The north tower's spire was completely replaced with new stone when it was found to be leaning over the street; a new cross was set atop it once it was completed. A rolled lead roof, the only one currently in place in the United States, was installed to make sure it was watertight. After $19 million total had been spent, the cathedral was reopened in 2010 and rededicated on its 158th anniversary later that year. A thousand people attended the Mass celebrated by Hubbard along with his New York counterpart, Timothy Dolan, and Dolan's predecessor, Cardinal Edward Egan. Hubbard called the cathedral's presence among the many state government buildings nearby a reminder of the presence of God in human affairs and said it was for the whole community, not just Albany's Catholics. He called particular attention to the restored original colors, recalling how he had been disappointed with the building's gloomy interior on his first visit to it as a boy. Many who attended were impressed with the restoration, particularly the return of the original paint. Music Music has been a major part of the cathedral's spiritual offerings since its construction, although it has been affected by the same neglect that the building suffered from in the 20th century. Former musical director Thomas Savoy, who composed as well as programmed the musical selections for services, found in his research that the cathedral had a resident orchestra and 75-member choir, and performed classical music regularly at services. The cathedral sees regular use as a performance space. In addition to an annual schedule of sacred music, it has been host to performances by secular ensembles such as the Albany Symphony Orchestra and Empire State Youth Orchestra. Visiting artists who have performed at the cathedral include Irish tenor Anthony Kearns. =Organ= Upon its opening in 1852, the cathedral had a three-manual pipe organ designed by Henry Erben. The instrument, high, deep and wide, cost $8,000 ($ in modern dollars). It had 42 stops and 3,000 pipes. Modifications in 1880 included overhanging keys, additional notes and mechanical stop control. In 1947 that organ was incorporated into a new organ built by M.P. Moller's facility in Hagerstown, Maryland. Several ranks of the original pipes were included while the original casework was replaced. A trumpet en chamade was added in 1969. By the late 1970s vibrations and other damage from the construction of the Empire State Plaza state government complex in the neighborhood had left the organ effectively unusable. An electronic organ was brought in to replace it. When the church was renovated in the first decade of the 21st century it was removed and replaced by a smaller temporary instrument. The pipes of the Moller organ were removed from the choir loft during the renovation. They were placed into storage in hopes that they will be used again in the future construction of a new pipe organ. =Bells= By the mid-1970s, none of the 10 Meneely bells in the towers had been rung for a long time, since at least the early 1960s. Their wooden supports, poorly built and incomplete, were too deteriorated. As part of the restoration, one volunteer, Joe Connors, looked into restoring them. A system had been installed to allow the bells to be run electronically, but Connors discovered that mistakes had been made on both the hardware and the software that ran it. As a result, the Westminster Quarters tones that rang every 15 minutes sounded off-key. According to Savoy, they had been programmed to play notes that the bells themselves didn't have. After fixing the software errors, Connors got it to play the quarters correctly, but deactivated any other hymns until new software could be purchased. In the meantime, he offered to restore the pulleys and belts that were broken, allowing them to be played manually. By early 2012 Connors had restored seven of the bells. Services Mass is celebrated twice a day on weekdays, in the morning and at noon, complemented by an evening Mass during Lent. The Liturgy of the Hours is observed after the morning Mass and on Saturday mornings. On Fridays, the Stations of the Cross are celebrated in the evening. Saturday evening, an Anticipated Mass is celebrated, with three Masses on Sunday. A similar schedule holds for Masses on Holy Days. alt=A starkly lit stone alcove with a pointed arch and a statue of a man in a robe with one hand over his chest. Below are shelves with bright golden objects on them. A small folded partition and low chair is on the floor at left Other sacraments regularly offered by the cathedral include confession, during the half-hour before the weekday noon Mass and the hour before Saturday. It may also be done by appointment. Baptisms of infants are usually done during the midday Mass on the first Sunday of the month. Weddings, such as those of Catherine Smith and Madeline Cuomo, are also performed in the cathedral; appointments must be made at least six months in advance. The Anointing of the Sick can be arranged by appointment. As the cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Albany, an area covering 14 counties and including 300,000 Catholics, many important special services take place there as well. These include services on the major Christian holidays, such as Midnight Mass on Christmas and Easter, as well as Chrism Mass and confirmations. Major events within the diocesan hierarchy, such as the ordination of priests and deacons and the consecration of bishops, take place at the cathedral.

It operates Pecatonica High School, Pecatonica Middle School and Pecatonica Elementary School. The high school and middle school are located in the same building, referred to as Pecatonica Middle/High School. The Middle School, High School, and District Office, are located in Blanchardville, WI, while the elementary building is located in Hollandale, Wisconsin. The school district consolidated in 1971, and the first graduating class of Pecatonica High School was in May 1972. The Village of Blanchardville's school building - Blanchardville High School - became the Pecatonica High School, with classes of 7th and 8th grade operating in the top floor. The Village of Hollandale's \\"Hollandale High School\\" building became the elementary building in the original structure, built in 1952, operating grades 1st through 6th. Initially, the Village of Argyle was to be included in the consolidation plans between the villages, but dropped out of consideration, according to the original consolidation study, in 1969. The school district is rural, encompassing an area of Lafayette County, Iowa County, Green County, and Dane County. The majority of the students live in Iowa County and Lafayette County, particularly in the Villages of Blanchardville, Hollandale, and the Town of Moscow. Curriculum The school district's curriculum includes a college prep curriculum as well as courses that prepare students for some additional post-secondary study, perhaps at a technical or other 2-year college. Each year, the graduating class, which ranges from 30-45 students, sends students to top public and private universities in the State of Wisconsin, and 2-year colleges, primarily Southwest Technical College in Fennimore, and Madison College, in Madison, WI. Pecatonica High School is one of only 60 high schools in the State that offers computer science programming courses, including AP Computer Science. This High School campus is located only 20 miles from EPIC Systems in Verona, WI. The high school curriculum also has strong offerings in health, nutrition, and bio-technology, biology, physics, and agriculture. The art and music programs are well known in the area. Each year, the students are exposed to strong curricular field trips in the nearby State Parks, as well as arts opportunities at nearby \\"American Players Theater\\" and the Overture Center in Madison, WI, and offerings on the University of Wisconsin Madison campus. In 2013 the school district entered a cooperative distance learning consortium with Mineral Point High School, Kickapoo High School, Riverdale High School, and Highland High School, to expand curricular offerings to students, particularly in electives and advanced placement courses. Athletics The school district has a strong athletics program, particularly due to the efforts of the Pecatonica Booster Club's Little Vikings Program for elementary and middle school students. There are several cooperatives in place with nearby Argyle School District. Fall sports include the cooperative for football and cross- country (boys and girls), and volleyball. Winter sports include girls and boys basketball, and a wrestling cooperative. Spring sports include softball and baseball, and a track and field cooperative and golf cooperative.

This version, usually called the 33 stack or 3-3-5 stack, uses an extra strong safety, and \\"stacks\\" linebackers and safeties directly behind the defensive linemen. In American football, the 3‚Äì3‚Äì5 defense is a defensive alignment consisting of three down linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. The 3‚Äì3‚Äì5 defense can also be referred to as the 3-3 stack and the Spread Defense. It is one form of the nickel defense, a generic term for a formation with five defensive backs. Veteran college football defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn is widely credited with being the main innovator of the 3-3-5 scheme. This alignment is generally used when the defense is trying to confuse the offense by applying different blitz pressures on the offense while playing mostly zone or sometimes man coverage. This alignment is rarely seen in the NFL , but is used by many high schools to counterattack the spread offense scheme. Boise State, West Virginia, BYU, and Arizona have used this formation with success in college football. Michigan ran this formation during the 2010 season. TCU uses this as a variant formation; its base defense is a different nickel set, the 4‚Äì2‚Äì5. In 2017 Iowa State adopted this defense as a counter to the Air raid offenses commonly encountered the Big 12 conference. Teams that run the 3-3-5 generally use it because they are a relatively fast but smaller unit compared to the opposing offense, and they want to cause blocking assignment issues for that offense. Also, a 3-3-5 can be adjusted to a 4-3, 3-4, or 4-4 defense with the same starting players. To effectively play the 3-3-5, the \\"Front 8\\" (e.g. the eight defensive players closest to the line of scrimmage) must be physical and tough. The three down lineman must be able to control the running lanes, execute an effective pass rush, and be able to keep the opposing offensive line occupied so that the linebackers can make plays. The two outside or \\"Stud\\" linebackers must be effective at pressuring the offensive line and reading and reacting to the play as it develops. The middle linebacker (also known as the \\"Mike\\" linebacker) must be able to effectively move in the direction the play is going (also known as \\"flowing to the ball\\") while also being able to shed blockers and make plays. The defensive secondary must be equally capable of pressuring the offensive lineman and dropping back into pass coverage. In the 33 stack version, the third safety (nicknamed the \\"Aztec\\" safety) must be a versatile athlete capable of dropping into coverage, pressuring the quarterback, or coming up in run support as a \\"Mike\\" linebacker would in a 3-4 alignment.

These protests culminated in the 1981 Irish hunger strike in which ten prisoners died. This article lists the various artistic responses to these protests, made at the time and subsequently by artists supportive or opposing the protestors, and by artists who were uninvolved in the conflict. Street Art Mural depicting Bobby Sands, on the Sinn F√©in offices Following the hunger strike, nationalist murals depicting those considered martyrs of the hungerstrike, such as Bobby Sands began to appear, relying on images and iconography developed by prisoners who hand crafted works of art and decorated their cells with murals and painting. Over one hundred murals were painted in 1981 by Catholic youth, with the lark in barbed wire as the most common secular symbolic image, due largely to Sands's use of the lark in his writings and as a pseudonym. Other popular images included the H representing H-block, crosses and flags, with secular images predominating, many with mottos and poems, and many murals were copies of photographs, such as the firing squad at Bobby Sands funeral service. *The People's Gallery is an area in the Bogside area of Derry, where a trio of artists known as the Bogside Artists have created a series of murals depicting events during the Troubles. The Raymond McCartney mural on Rossville street, Bogside, is dedicated to \\"The H Block & Armagh Prison Struggle And In Memory Of Bobby Sands, Kevin Lynch, Frank Hughes, Kieron Doherty, Raymond McCreesh, Tom McElwee, Patsy O'Hare, Michael Devine, Martin Hurson, Joe McDonnell.\\" This mural depicts Raymond McCarney alongside a woman who suffered during the hunger strike. In black and white, the man resembles Christ, and recalls both Christ's suffering at the hands of barbarians and his fasting in the desert. *A mural depicting Bobby Sands still exists on the gable end of the headquarters building of Sinn F√©in, on the Falls Road in Belfast. *In the Ardoyne area of Belfast, a street mural dedicated to the 1981 hunger strikers on the 25th anniversary of Martin Hurson's death. *In 2001 a mural dedicated to the memory Patsy O'Hara was created at Ardfoyle in Bishop Street. *In 2008 √ìgra Shinn F√©in painted a mural in the town of Derry honouring the hunger strikers.  Poetry  *One of the hunger strikers, Bobby Sands wrote poetry throughout the protest. His best known poems include Weeping Winds and The Rhythm of Time Sands's narratives and various poems appear in the anthology Skylark Sing Your Lonely Song, and his poetry has been set to music by Se√°n Tyrell for his album A Message of Peace. *Vincent Buckley, 'Hunger Strike', published in Last Poems 1991 *Award- winning poet Medbh McGuckian cites Bobby Sands's hunger strike as an influence on her poetry, saying \\"We moved into a house and I have a lot of moving-into- a-house poems around that time; but, they're all thinking about Bobby Sands. You wouldn't know they were about Bobby Sands because I made him into a kind of icon.\\" McGukian also says that shortly following Sands's death, she was unable to write poetry to him, but commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death with The Sands of Saint Cyprien, a poetic depiction of the Saint Cyprien concentration camp. *In Bobby Sands desfallece en el muro, Chilean poet Carmen Berenguer draws parallels between Chile under Pinochet and Northern Ireland of 1981, adopting Sands's voice in the first person. *In Paula Meehan's poem Hunger Strike, a female voice refers to the prisoners in H-block, speaking in the first person plural, identifying with the community's rage at the authorities refusal to relent. The persona undertakes a \\"personal strike\\", adopting first personal singular and withdrawing from life, her garden untended, as the image of the dying Sands dominates the community's awareness. Towards the end, an old woman rescues the speaker, bring her bread and butter, and chiding her for her self-imposed alienation. *For Bobby Sands on the Eve of his Death by Michael Davitt.  Fiction  * Hunger Strike - Reflections on the 1981 Republican Hunger Strike, edited by Danny Morrison, was published to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the hunger strike, and featured contributions, many of them specially commissioned, from well-known novelists and poets, former prisoners and activists. * Everything in this country must by Colum McCann, published in 2006 features the novella \\"Hunger Strike\\" written from the perspective of a boy going through puberty at the same time as his uncle is in Long Kesh, taking part in a hunger strike. Asked why he had chosen to write about the hunger strike, he said \\"...as far as I know there has been no fictional examination of the wound that the Hunger Strikes left on all of us. Twenty years have passed, perhaps just long enough for us to begin to see this history a new light. I believe that fiction can capture the moment when the thorn enters the skin.\\" *The British/Irish novelist Marion Urch set her 1996 novel \\"Violent Shadows\\" (Headline Review 1996) in the year of the hunger strikes. The novel is included in many summaries of Troubles fiction including \\"Gangsters and Guerillas\\" Patrick Magee. 2001. It was also the subject of a PhD ‚ÄúRepresenting the Unnarratable -Feminist Terrorism‚Äù by Pamela Grieman (University of Southern California. 2010) An extract from the novel was shortlisted for the Irish Post short story competition in 1995. Adjudicator Patrick McCabe called it ‚Äúpowerful, it seems to document all the pain of Irish history in a few short pages.‚Äù  Theatre  Bobby Sands, M.P. is a play written by Judy GeBauer. Films *'Hunger' *'Some Mother's Son *H3 *Bobby Sands: 66 Days  Songs  A number of songs were written in response to the hunger strike by artists and groups such as Christy Moore and the Wolfe Tones, including some songs based on the poetry Sands wrote, Some of the songs are memorials to specific participants in the strike, such as The Boy from Tamlaghduff, written by Christy Moore in 1983 in memory of Francis Hughes. A few songs were written by Sands such as McIlhatton, a song about a moonshiner, and Back Home in Derry, a ballad about deportees. The British government has at times banned some of these song, such as The Time has Come and Joe McDonnell. In 2006, a proposed bill which would outlaw promotion or glorification of terrorist or violent acts raised concerns that performance of Irish songs such as The H-Block Song, which had become an anthem of the Irish Republicans following the hunger strike, could lead to imprisonment. Many Irish rebel songs focus on a person or persons viewed as a martyr, with themes of endurance, daring, loyalty, and the artistic, moral and intellectual qualities of the subjects. The notion of endurance has been associated with the belief that sufferers, rather than those at whose hand they suffer, will ultimately triumph in seen in the songs about the ten hunger strikers. In Bobby Sands, MP, Sands is portrayed as an artist and poet. The theme of sacrifice also plays a role, such as the hunger striker asking his family to let him go in The Time has Come, written by Christy Moore and Donal Lunny about the final meeting between Patsy O'Hara and his mother. * The Boy from Tamlaghduff, written and performed by Christy Moore 'He fought them every day he lived and he fought when he died,' Christy Moore sings in The Boy From Tamlaghtduff.\\" * Back Home in Derry, by Bobby Sands, performed by Christy Moore * McIlhatton, written by Bobby Sands performed by Christy Moore * On the Blanket, written and performed by Mick Hanly and Christy Moore * Southern Winds - a song about Ray McCreesh written and performed by Christy Moore * Ninety Miles from Dublin - Written and performed by Christy Moore. * The Roll of Honour \\\\- Gerry O'Glacain (The Irish Brigade) * Death Before Revenge - Pangur Ban * The H-block Song, written by Francie Brolly * The People's Own MP - Christy Moore * Song For Marcella - Bik McFarlane * 10 Years On - Blaggers I.T.A. * Bobby Sands - Soldat Louis * Bobby Sands - Meic Stevens * Inspiration - Easterhouse: Written in honour of the hunger strikers, the sleeve for the release bore an image of Bobby Sands. * Bobby Untitled - Nicky Wire on his album \\"I Killed The Zeitgeist\\" * It's Going To Happen!

County names in the United States automatically qualify as legal appellations of origin for wine produced from grapes grown in that county and do not require registration with the United States Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The vast majority of Napa County is covered by the boundaries of the world-famous Napa Valley AVA, an American Viticultural Area, and its various sub-appellations. The portion of the county that falls outside of the boundaries of the Napa Valley AVA is northeast of the Chiles Valley AVA, where few grapes are cultivated. Few wines are produced that carry a Napa County appellation of origin designation, as almost every wine produced from grapes grown in the county is eligible for release with the more commercially profitable Napa Valley AVA designation. The most common use of Napa County on a wine label is when a wine has been produced from grapes grown in two or more counties, such as Sonoma County and Napa County. In such a case, the wine label must indicate what percentage of grapes were sourced from each county.  History = Early history = The Napa County wine industry began when George Yount, of Sonoma County, grew the first wine grapes in Napa Valley in the mid-nineteenth century. Although he is credited with starting the wine industry, Yount did not grow the industry, and it was not until Charles Krug arrived in Napa that the industry began to explode. In 1858, Charles Krug began producing wine in Napa with vintner John Patchett‚Äôs grapes. Three years later, in 1861, Krug founded Charles Krug winery (Napa County‚Äôs first commercial winery), which still exists today, and with the guidance of winemakers Agoston Haraszthy and John Patchett along with Patchett‚Äôs grapes, Charles Krug began to produce wine. Between 1870 and 1880, Napa County‚Äôs wine output increased by almost 1000%, and by 1890 Napa County was California‚Äôs leading county in terms of gallons of wine produced. Much of the growth that Napa County experienced in the late nineteenth century is due to developments in infrastructure such as the telegraph and the railroad as well as cheap Chinese labor. The development of the railroad in Napa made it easy to transport crops, wine, and tourists. During Napa County‚Äôs wine production boom, California wine had a reputation for false labelling and dishonest adulteration processes. At this time, Gustave Niebaum, a wealthy businessman, established Inglenook winery with the intention of improving the wine industry‚Äôs image. Niebaum had a vision for Napa County, and in 1888 Niebaum began growing high quality wine grapes using French methods and techniques. Napa County experienced global exposure at the 1889 World‚Äôs Fair in Paris where Inglenook wines won awards. Niebaum helped to improve the wine- making business in Napa so that it began to attract other wealthy entrepreneurs. = Major setbacks = As the turn of the 20th century approached, a series of setbacks commenced that devastated the Napa County wine industry for decades. A phylloxera outbreak decimated the wine grape crop, and this was followed by Prohibition in 1918, which made the production and transportation of alcohol illegal in the United States. In 1933, when Prohibition was repealed, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression, and as a result the Napa County wine industry did not fully recover until 1960‚Äôs. = Modern era = The Napa County wine industry was once again in a period of expansion as new entrepreneurs with big visions such as Robert Mondavi in 1966 flocked to the valley; however, this time vintners and residents concerned about the population growth and shift towards urbanization in the region worked together to enact legislation making it more difficult to develop land in Napa. In 1968, Napa County passed the Napa Valley Agricultural Preserve, which protects rural open space within the county. As the new investors and entrepreneurs began moving to Napa County, the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 put Napa on the world stage as two wines from Napa County beat well-known wines from France. After 1976, Napa County was globally recognized for producing quality wines. From 1976 to the present, the Napa County wine industry has grown exponentially. In 1975, Napa County was home to 45 wineries, and in 1980 there were over 100 wineries operating in Napa County. This level of growth has sustained to the present day, as in 2012, there were 430 wineries in Napa County. The relatively new brand of high quality wine that is now associated with Napa County has attracted many wealthy investors to the region, and today Napa‚Äôs economy is booming due to the success of the wine industry and a thriving wine tourism industry.  Terroir  The Napa Valley is located east of Sonoma under the backdrop of Mount Saint Helena, which is part of the Mayacamas Mountain Range. During the wine grape growing season, cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean and the San Pablo Bay flows into the southern end of the valley and goes up in elevation towards the northern end. Because of the increase in elevation, temperatures at the northern end of the valley tend to be significantly warmer than temperatures at the southern end. In addition to the differences in temperature, the western and northern portions of the valley experiences higher levels of precipitation than the eastern and southern portions due to a rain shadow caused by the vast differences in elevation in the region. The Napa Valley as a whole contains several climate regions, and this provides an ideal terroir for growing a variety of wine grapes due to the variation in temperature and precipitation as well as variations in soil composition and topography.  Wine and the local economy = By the numbers = In 2005, the Napa County wine industry was estimated to be worth in excess of $9.5 billion. Nearly 89% of all United States wine is produced in California, and roughly a third of California wineries are based in Napa County, but only about 4% of California wine is produced in Napa. Once Napa County wine was recognized on the world stage in France, local producers used the newfound reputation to sell wine from the region for a premium over other wines produced elsewhere in California of the same quality. Over 50% of California wine bottles costing more than $15 are produced in Napa County. It is because of this reputation that the return on one ton of wine grapes grown in Napa is $3600, while neighboring Sonoma comes in second at $2200 per ton as of 2012. In comparison with other wine grape growing regions in California, Napa ranks second to last in terms of wine grape yield per acre at just over 3 tons grown per acre. = Tourism = Wine tourism is a staple for Napa County‚Äôs local economy. The concept of wine tourism is relatively new, and researchers have concluded that there are a number of factors that make Napa County an attractive destination for tourists. The Napa County lifestyle, for instance, which embodies the importance of wellness and relaxation as well as luxury and fine wine and cuisine, is thought to be a distinguishing factor that draws tourists. Another factor is the level of interconnectedness between industries within Napa County. Wine production is the bedrock of the local economy, and local hotels, restaurants, and wineries work together to collectively promote tourism in the region. Additionally, there is a high level of community involvement and support for the wine tourism industry in Napa County, as roughly half of the local population is employed by the wine related industries. As of April, 2016, Napa County is home to approximately 70 hotels, resorts, inns, and bed and breakfast type establishments geared towards the tourism industry, with a total room count of 4,815. This number is up from 3,371 in 2005 largely due a 40% increase from 2006 to 2010. The Great Recession caused a number of proposed development to be put on hold, and now many experts are saying the hotel industry in Napa County is on the verge of another boom, with more than 2,000 new guestrooms at 18 locations either being planned or currently under construction. = Environmental preservation controversy = There are significant benefits as well as negatives to the booming wine tourism industry in Napa County. For example, the Napa County wine industry generated $1.4 billion in wages in 2004. Most of the County‚Äôs residents depend on the wine industry and tourism. On the other hand, the growing demand for hotels and resources for the tourism industry is causing controversy among locals. Many residents are concerned about increased levels of traffic, a dwindling water supply, infrastructure, and environmental pressures. Working to slow the growth in the wine tourism industry, there are many agricultural land protection policies (meant to maintain the character and agricultural quality of the region) in effect in Napa County that make it difficult and expensive to expand the tourism industry.

It was extended to Ultima in 1900, to Chillingollah in 1909, to Manangatang in 1914, to Annuello in 1921, and Robinvale in 1924. In 1930, it was extended to Koorakee, New South Wales, as part of the proposed Lette railway line, although that section was never officially opened for traffic. The extension into New South Wales involved the construction of a lift-span bridge over the Murray River.Wurr, Chris (April 1999). \\"Robinvale to Lette Railway\\", Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, pp. 123-138 The section in New South Wales closed in 1943. Access to Melbourne was originally from the Bendigo line via Bridgewater, until the opening of the Dunolly to Inglewood route to the Mildura line in 1888. The last regular passenger service on the line, operated by a DERM, ran from Bendigo to Robinvale on 3 June 1978. From 5 June 1978, the service was replaced by Bendigo ‚Äì Ultima and Swan Hill ‚Äì Robinvale buses. Operation Today the line operates using the Train Order Working system of safeworking, with crossing loops provided at Dunolly, Korong Vale, and Robinvale. Speed limits are set between to Manangatang, with all mainline locomotives permitted. Beyond there speed limit is and G and XR class locomotives are banned. The line today is seen as required for grain services, and containerised freight to Boort where an intermodal is operated by Wimmera Container Lines. In 2008 the line was booked out for upgrades to the track and level crossings from Ultima to Robinvale. In April 2008 it was announced that the Korong Vale ‚Äì Quambatook section of the line would be upgraded as part of the Victorian core grain network, in a $23.7 million package with six other lines. The Dunolly ‚Äì Korong Vale section had already been upgraded. Since 2008, the line has been cut back to Manangatang; the containers formerly loaded at Boort are now loaded at Donald (Mildura line). The Eaglehawk (Bendigo) - Inglewood link has had traffic suspended, and has been disconnected at the northern end. All trains run via Dunolly (Mildura line). The line speed has been cut to 55 km/h to Lalbert, then 25 km/h beyond. The line is one of three being converted to standard gauge. While the Mildura line is being converted, the containers normally loaded at Merbein are being loaded at Manangatang. At some time in 2018, the Mildura/Merbein work will be finished, and Manangatang will be closed temporarily for conversion and upgrading.

Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath is described as being an American Colonel from Louisiana of French descent. After service in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), de La Bath worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), then the National Security Council (NSC). In Michel Hazanavicius's films of the 2000s, the character is a French citizen working for the Service de Documentation Ext√©rieure et de Contre-Espionnage, the French intelligence agency from 1944 to 1982 (now DGSE).

After Jean Bruce died in a car accident in 1963, his wife Josette Bruce (signing as \\"J.Bruce\\") wrote 143 OSS 117 novels before retiring in 1985. Starting in 1987, Bruce's daughter Martine and her husband Fran√ßois wrote 23 more OSS 117 books.OSS 117 entreprise familiale, documentary for the French channel 13√®me rue , retrieved on 29 October 2010.

France, Lonely Planet, 2007 The first OSS 117 film, OSS 117 Is Not Dead, was made in 1957 with Ivan Desny as OSS 117.Blake, Matt & Deal, David The Eurospy Guide Luminary Press 2004 In 1960, the rights to the Jean Bruce novel Documents √† vendre, were purchased for filming by as Le Bal des espions (1960). However the rights to the character of OSS 117 had not been agreed upon so the character's name was changed to Brian Cannon, the name of another character from a novel by Jean Bruce, Romance de la Mort. In the 1960s, the character was featured in a successful Eurospy film series which was mostly directed by Andr√© Hunebelle. The role was played initially by Kerwin Mathews, and then by Frederick Stafford, with John Gavin playing the role when Stafford was filming Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz. =Parodies= The 2006 and 2009 films OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and OSS 117: Lost in Rio, conceived as spoofs of the Eurospy genre,Review of OSS 117: Lost in Rio on sbs.com.au both recreated and parodied OSS 117. The character, reinvented as a French spy working for the SDECE, was turned into a comedy character and portrayed by Jean Dujardin as a self-important, dim-witted and politically incorrect oaf. These films, by director Michel Hazanavicius, are an homage to the action films and spy movies of the 1950s and 1960s (particularly Sean Connery's portrayal of James Bond, Alfred Hitchcock films, and to a lesser extent, the earlier serious adaptations of OSS 's Andr√© Hunebelle). The character of OSS 117 (pronounced \\"cent dix-sept\\"...((One Hundred and Seventeen in French)) not one one seven or even double one seven), played by Jean Dujardin, is shown as quintessentially \\"franchouillard\\" (typically French). He often creates awkward social situations due to his colonial ideology, staunch French patriotism, chauvinism and machismo. At the same time, he embodies the ideal secret agent archetype: handsome, physically adept (he loves fighting and dances everything from the mambo to the twist), and he uses his charm and seduces quite a few women. A third film, entitled OSS 117: Alerte Rouge en Afrique Noire (English title yet to be announced), commenced production in November 2019, scheduled for release in France on 3 February 2021.

Rashed eds., Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca et Byzantina, Series Academica, De Gruyter, 2020, (includes topical studies by other scholars). Biography As Boethus was a disciple of Andronicus of Rhodes,Ammonius Hermiae, Comment, in Aristotle's Categories. he must have travelled at an early age to Rome and Athens, in which cities Andronicus is known to have taught. Strabo, who mentions him and his brother Diodotus among the celebrated persons of Sidon, speaks of him at the same time as his own teacher (or fellow pupil) in Peripatetic philosophy.Strabo, Geographica, 16.2.24 Among his works, all of which are now lost, there was one on the nature of the soul, and also a commentary on Aristotle's Categories, which is mentioned by Ammonius in his commentary on the same work of Aristotle. Ammonius quotes also an opinion of Boethus concerning the study of the works of Aristotle, viz. that the student should begin with the Physics, whereas Andronicus had maintained that the beginning should be made with the Logic writings of Aristotle. According to Giovanni Reale, in The Schools of the Imperial Age, Boethus believed that ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô was ‚Äòmatter‚Äô ‚Äì that it was the composite of being, and not the individual form of being. Thus ‚Äúform falls outside of the category of substance and enters into the scope of other categories‚Äù.The Schools of the Imperial Age, Giovanni Reale, pp. 18-19. The significance of this is that individuality is not only how we understand and interpret reality, but is actually the basic nature of that reality. That 'true reality' was not some universal substance, but consisted of individual forms. Similarly, in ethics, Boethus declared that ‚Äúthe original goal (the proton oikeion) towards which we tend is ourselves in relation to ourselves. In agreement with that view, he says that we do not love anyone in preference to ourselves and finally that we only love others in reference to ourselves‚Äù.The Schools of the Imperial Age, Giovanni Reale, p. 19.

History St. Mark's railway station, the first in Lincoln, was opened by the Midland Railway in 1846. It was originally a terminus; the line was extended through the station only a few years after it opened, to connect with the Great Northern Railway just to the east of that company's Lincoln Central station. The Durham Ox Junction was also crossed by a road, leading to many delays. The junction was crossed by Pelham Bridge in the mid-1950s. Until its closure St. Marks was the mainline station, with through services from Cleethorpes to London King's Cross. Prior to closure of the Lincoln-to- Grantham line during the Beeching Axe, London services had used Lincoln Central. Direct services from London ceased with rail privatisation; after this, travel to St Marks required a change of train at Newark North Gate. To avoid unnecessarily operating two stations, St Marks closed in 1985; services were diverted to the nearby Lincoln Central. The construction of a new 80-metre length of track to the west allowed services from Newark Castle station to reach Lincoln Central. The grand ionic portico that was once the entrance has been preserved and, as of January 2007, was home to Lakeland Limited as part of the commercial development of the site. A mock signalbox has also been erected in the car park on which has been affixed an original sign from the station. The remainder of the former station site is now St. Marks Shopping Centre. The redevelopment, in keeping with the preserved buildings, won an Ian Allan Heritage Award in 2009, which is commemorated by a plaque. British Railways Pre-Grouping Atlas And Gazetteer, W.

Operated by a variety of companies between 1912 and 1977, the cannery was one of many which operated in Southeast Alaska, an area historically rich in salmon. The cannery's surviving buildings are among the best-preserved of the period, and provide a window into the labor practices of the cannery operators, which emphasized production over working conditions, and made significant use of immigrant contract workers. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. and Description and history The Kake Cannery is located about southeast of the small community of Kake, Alaska, located on the northeastern coast of Kupreanof Island. It is about south of Juneau. The complex includes 18 buildings, out of an estimated 21 that were built by the cannery's owners and operators during its period of use. All of these buildings are mounted on wooden pilings, and are connected by boardwalks. Its main structures included four large buildings: the main cannery and three warehouses. Warehouse No. 1 housed the company offices and storage facilities, and housed a retail operation. Warehouse No. 2 housed facilities for storing and repairing nets, as well as storing canned fish. The cannery and these two warehouses were built around 1912. Warehouse No. 4 (there is no documented Warehouse No. 3) was built in the 1930s, and housed a mechanized can-forming operation. The complex includes a variety of living quarters. There are two bunkhouses, one which was specifically designated for Japanese and Filipino workers, and another for whites. A third bunkhouse, for Chinese workers, has not survived. Six single-family dwellings also survive, one set aside for the supervisor, and another for the cook. Kake cannery The cannery was built in 1912 by the Sanborn Cutting Company. It was operated over the next several decades by Sunny Point Packing and the Alaska Pacific Salmon Packing Corporation, growing under the latter in the 1930s to become one of the largest fish packers in the region. During this time, the operators used generally race-based division of labor, assigning positions of responsibility to white men, and various lower-level menial tasks to immigrants from China, Japan, and elsewhere. Native Tlingit were employed to catch fish. Most of this labor was hired through contractor middlemen, who were responsible for housing and feeding the workers. In 1940 the cannery was purchased by P. E. Harris & Company. The salmon fishery, however, was in decline, and the cannery was closed in 1946. It was sold in 1949 to a Native corporation, and operated as the Keku Cannery, but its packing operation was limited by the reduced fishery, and the eventual banning of the use of traps by the state Alaska after statehood. It was permanently closed in 1977.

Life Dinsdale was born in Aberystwyth, Wales, the son of Felix and Dorys (Smith) Dinsdale, who were on a year's leave from China where his father was a shipping agent. Along with his parents, his older sister, Felicity, and later a younger brother, Peter, he lived in Hong Kong, Antung, and Shanghai, going to the China Inland Missionary School in Chefoo some 500 miles away from his home.. This necessitated a journey along the coast and in 1935 the ship, SS Tungchow, containing 70 British and American schoolchildren, was seized by pirates. Eventually Dinsdale and the other children were rescued by HMS Hermes a British Aircraft carrier. The 10-year-old Dinsdale wrote an account of the adventure which received second prize in a competition run by a local newspaper, his first success as a writer. In 1936 he and his brother returned to Britain to attend King's School, Worcester as boarders, and his sister was at a girls' school. In 1942-3 he attended the de Havilland Aeronautical Technical School, and also volunteered in the Home Guard, where during training he sustained a bullet wound to the hand, the object not being removed for 28 years. He joined the Royal Air Force becoming a pilot, and was training in Rhodesia and South Africa when the war ended so returned to complete his aeronautical training, and joining the aircraft industry. In 1951 he married Wendy Osborne. They went on to have four children: Simon, Alexandra, Dawn, Angus. They moved to Toronto where he became an aeronautical engineer for Avro Aircraft Ltd, moving to Rolls Royce aircraft division in Montreal in 1952, and back to Reading in the UK in 1956. He was mainly involved on the flight testing of jet engines. He was an Associate member of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Being made redundant from the aircraft industry in 1962 he took a job as a self-employed insurance salesman, which allowed him to spend more time on a passion he had developed for proving the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, and which was to take over his life. He later got income from lecturing and the sale of books. On 14 December 1987 he died of a heart attack at his home in Reading, and was cremated on 21 December. He was survived by his wife and four children. Loch Ness Monster An article \\"The Day I saw the Loch Ness Monster\\" in Everybody's magazine (21 Feb 1959) caught his attention, and he began reading more about the topic. In April 1960 he made a lone expedition to the Loch, with six days of watching. On the fourth day (21 April) and sixth day (23 April) he took cine film of a moving object on the surface. Along with his binocular observations, he was convinced that the film of 23 April was authentic proof of the existence of the monster, so next day he got a dinghy to take a similar track which he recorded on the remaining part of the film for comparison.. Having shown the film to various people, he was approached by a newspaper reporter, and on 13 June the incident was reported in the Daily Mail with images and the film was shown on the BBC Panorama TV programme. Following this, he was commissioned to write a book Loch Ness Monster which was published in 1961. The story and subsequent comments spread through the media. According to one author One consequence was the formation of the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau (LNPIB) in 1962 by MP David James with naturalist Sir Peter Scott, which mounted volunteer groups each summer until 1972. Dinsdale twice acted as Group Commander for two weeks. In 1966 the film received publicity again, having been analysed by the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC) which included the statement that the object was 'probably animate'. In 1967 he received a grant from Kodak for photographic equipment to help in his search. He had other sightings including what he described as a head and neck: Despite as many visits to the Loch as he could afford, he failed to obtain any more film footage. In July 1987 at a two-day symposium in the Royal Scottish Museum's Natural History Department he was made an Honorary Member of the International Society of Cryptozoology (ISC) for  Publications  * 1961 Tim Dinsdale Loch Ness Monster (Routledge & Kegan Paul) (UK); 1962 (Chilton) (USA) * 1966 Tim Dinsdale The Leviathans (Routledge & Kegan Paul) * 1972 Tim Dinsdale Loch Ness Monster, 2nd ed (Routledge & Kegan Paul) * 1973 Tim Dinsdale The Story of the Loch Ness Monster (Target) * 1975 Tim Dinsdale Project Water Horse: The True Story of the Monster Quest at Loch Ness (Routledge & Kegan Paul) * 1976 Tim Dinsdale The Leviathans (revised edition) (Futura) * 1977 Tim Dinsdale The Facts About Loch Ness and the Monster (Johnston & Bacon)  References Bibliography * Pages are location in Kindle version. * 1968 reprint by the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau plus postscript by the author, of the 1961 book * Category:1924 births Category:1987 deaths Category:British aerospace engineers Category:Cryptozoologists Category:Loch Ness Monster Category:People educated at King's School, Worcester Category:People from Aberystwyth ","title":"Tim Dinsdale"},{"id":"15050071","text":"Shawn Crable (born December 26, 1984) is a former professional American football linebacker.

All students must wear the Eco-Blazer with the school crest ; boys wear a plain white shirt and striped school tie and navy trousers; girls may wear either navy blue trousers or a stitched down pleated skirt with a short sleeved navy and white striped v-neck blouse. The expense of the uniform caused controversy in 2009, due to the expense of the uniform excluding the PE kit. A press release was submitted on the school website claiming many of the facts written by the newspaper articles are incorrect, and that the uniform was very hard wearing due to its materials however, many of the products are available for less in different stores. As a response to the controversy, the school started a 'nearly new uniform' shop where the uniform could be brought cheaper.

The report warned of the potential damage caused by the motor car, while offering ways to mitigate it. It gave planners a set of policy blueprints to deal with its effects on the urban environment, including traffic containment and segregation, which could be balanced against urban redevelopment, new corridor and distribution roads and precincts. These policies shaped the development of the urban landscape in the UK and some other countries for two or three decades. Unusually for a technical policy report, it was so much in demand that Penguin abridged it and republished it as a book in 1964. Background Buchanan's report was commissioned in 1960 by Ernest Marples, Transport Minister in Harold Macmillan's government, whose manifesto had promised to improve the existing road network and relieve congestion in the towns. Britain was still reconstructing itself after the devastation of World War II, and, although the economy was recovering, towns and cities still had large areas of bomb damage that needed rebuilding or re- use. New motorways were being planned and built across the country, and the motor car was already starting to fill up towns and villages. Wartime had seen the establishment of central planning, and the discipline of urban planning was looking for good patterns and policies to be implemented as they rebuilt. Although the government was looking to manage motor vehicle growth, potentially with a congestion charge as suggested by the Smeed Report, this was contrasted by a strong desire for dramatic cost-saving measures in nationalised public transport. Doctor Beeching's proposed closure of a third of the passenger railway lines, the withdrawal of tramways and trolleybuses and shunning of light rail, with bus services offering a partial replacement, all emphasised the widely held expectation that \\"progress\\" would see an increasing dependency on private motor cars. This represented a departure from the previous policies set by the Salter Report of 1933, which looked to balance the needs of railways against motor vehicles. Predictions The Vicious Cycle of Predict and Provide At the time of the report, there were 10.5 million vehicles registered in Britain, but, at predicted growth rates, this number was expected to become 18 million by 1970, 27 million by 1980 and about 40 million vehicles in 2010, or 540 vehicles for every 1,000 population, equivalent to 1.3 cars per household. They expected growth in traffic to be uneven, with more congestion in South East England, and to incorporate a population that would reach 74 million. Buchanan declared: > It is impossible to spend any time on the study of the future of traffic in > towns without at once being appalled by the magnitude of the emergency that > is coming upon us. We are nourishing at immense cost a monster of great > potential destructiveness, and yet we love him dearly. To refuse to accept > the challenge it presents would be an act of defeatism. The impact of the motor car was compared with that of a heavy goods vehicle which; > given its head, would wreck our towns within a decade... The problems of > traffic are crowding in upon us with desperate urgency. Unless steps are > taken, the motor vehicle will defeat its own utility and bring about a > disastrous degradation of the surroundings for living... Either the utility > of vehicles in town will decline rapidly, or the pleasantness and safety of > surroundings will deteriorate catastrophically ‚Äì in all probability both > will happen. > Indeed it can be said in advance that the measures required to deal with the > full potential amount of motor traffic in big cities are so formidable that > society will have to ask itself seriously how far it is prepared to go with > the motor vehicle. There was a need to limit vehicle access to some urban areas: > Distasteful though we find the whole idea, we think that some deliberate > limitation of the volume of motor traffic is quite unavoidable. The need for > it just can't be escaped. Even when everything that it is possibly to do by > way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, > there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars > trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be > accommodated. Already the growth of vehicle ownership in America had not been held back by congestion in urban areas; they observed that congestion in Britain's smaller land mass might limit the use of cars but probably not affect people's desire for ownership as they became more affluent and hoped to try to use their cars. They saw the day coming when most adults would take the car \\"as much for granted as an overcoat\\", and value it as an \\"asset of the first order\\". There would also be pressure to house a growing population and disperse more population away from overcrowded cities. However, dispersing the population around the countryside would be synonymous with urban sprawl, and would defeat one of the reasons for car ownership, to get out into the countryside. Having examined the road network in Los Angeles and Fort Worth, Buchanan wished to avoid their dehumanising effects and their creation of pedestrian \\"no-go\\" areas. He also wished to ensure that the heritage within British towns was respected: > The American policy of providing motorways for commuters can succeed, even > in American conditions, only if there is a disregard for all considerations > other than the free flow of traffic which seems sometimes to be almost > ruthless. Our British cities are not only packed with buildings, they are > also packed with history and to drive motorways through them on the American > scale would inevitably destroy much that ought to be preserved. The rise of traffic congestion would waste people's time, who would soon have to spend time sitting in traffic, in addition to their time spent in sleep, work, and leisure. Already, the average speed in many cities had fallen to , and congestion was costing the British economy ¬£250 million in wasted man hours. Yet the motor car was also inextricably linked to the economy, with 2,305,000 people working in the motor trade, or 10 percent of the labour force. It had already eclipsed the railway, and would become more prominent in the movement of goods and the workforce. The expansion of public transport would not provide an answer on its own. However, the noise, fumes, pollution and visual intrusion of the cars and ugly traffic paraphernalia would overwhelm town centres, while vehicles parked on streets would force new hazards onto children at play. Safety considerations should move to become foremost in the design of streets; three quarters of all injury accidents were occurring within towns (although most fatalities happened on open roads). They feared that future generations would think that they were careless and callous to mix people and moving vehicles on the same streets. The report warned against trying to find a single \\"solution\\": > We have found it desirable to avoid the term 'solution' altogether for the > traffic problem is not such much a problem waiting for a solution as a > social situation requiring to be dealt with by policies patiently applied > over a period and revised from time to time in light of events. Recommendations Gracechurch Shopping Centre, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. An example of the new style of 1960-70's pedestrian precinct, separated from the historic road network, but at the cost of demolition of the earlier town shopping parade The report signified some fundamental shifts in attitudes to roads, by recognising that there were environmental disbenefits from traffic, and that large increases in capacity can exacerbate congestion problems, not solve them. This awareness of environmental impact was ahead of its time, and not translated into policy for some years in other countries, such as Germany or the USA, where the promotion of traffic flow remained paramount The scale of traffic growth envisaged would soon overtake any benefits that small-scale road improvement would offer, which would anyway divert attention from the large-scale solutions that would be needed. These solutions would be very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs. However, the report saw no turning back from people's new-found dependence on the car, and thought that there would be limits to how much traffic could be transferred to railways and buses. Towns should be worth living in, which meant more than just the ability to drive into the centre. Urban redevelopment should look to the long term, and avoid parsimonious short-termism. The report asked how bold the planners could be, when restricting access to town centres and controlling traffic flows: > It is a difficult and dangerous thing in a democracy to prevent a > substantial part of the population from doing things they do not regard as > wrong. ... The freedom with which a person can walk about and look around is > a very useful guide to the civilized quality of an urban area ... judged > against this standard, many of our towns now seem to leave a great deal to > be desired ... there must be areas of good environment where people can > live, work, shop, look about and move around on foot in reasonable freedom > from the hazards of motor traffic. The report recommended that certain standards should always be met, including safety, visual intrusion, noise, and pollution limits. But if a city was both financially able and willing, it should rebuild itself with modern traffic in mind. However, if circumstances meant that this was not possible it would have to restrain traffic, perhaps severely. This was revolutionary and ran counter to the wisdom of economists, who assumed that environmental standards could be set off against other considerations once they had been priced. Planners should set a policy regarding the character being sought for each urban area, and the level of traffic should then be managed to produce the desired effect, in a safe manner. This would result in towns with a lattice of environmentally planned areas joined by a road hierarchy, a network of distribution roads, with longer-distance traffic being directed around and away from these areas, rather like an interior would be designed with corridors serving a multitude of rooms. It recommended the selective use of bypasses around small and medium-sized towns to alleviate congestion in the centres, even though local businesses might complain at the loss of through-trade; the predicted increase in traffic would become more than an unmitigated nuisance in the future. However, it rejected a slavish use of ring-roads around large towns. As the detailed plans of these schemes often demanded far more land for junctions and wide roads than would be acceptable, it would be better to place restrictions on the volume of traffic that could access the area in these cases. Where restrictions were needed, this could often be achieved through some combination of licences or permits, parking restrictions, or subsidised public transport. However it recommended that the road user should not be denied too much access, and that restricting through congestion charging would not normally be the right approach, unless and until every possible alternative had been tested: > We think the public can justifiably demand to be fully informed about the > possibilities of adapting towns to motor traffic before there is any > question of applying restrictive measures. Above ground multi-storey car park near Kilmarnock centre, one (visually intrusive) solution to the problem of accommodating cars next to retail redevelopment Innovatively, the report recommended that some areas should change their outlook; rather than facing onto the street, shops could face onto squares or pedestrianised streets, with roof top or multi-storey parking nearby. Urban areas need not consist of buildings set alongside vehicular streets, instead multiple levels could be used with traffic moving underneath a building deck, with snug pedestrian alleys and contrasting open squares containing fountains and artwork. Schemes would need to be carefully considered when they incorporated historic buildings, but such schemes could not be applied to small areas. However, obsolete street patterns were already becoming frozen for decades by piecemeal rebuilding. Whilst these grand schemes would be expensive, the income from vehicle taxes could represent a regular source of income to draw from. This approach differed from the shopping mall concept, which was designed for the car on greenfield or out of town sites, and did not address the development of the existing urban landscape. =Examples= The report looked at a range of scenarios based on real towns, and suggested treatments that would balance the desire to enrich people's lives through car ownership while still maintain pleasant urban centres. London (Oxford Street area) Oxford Street, in London's West End \\"epitomizes the conflict between traffic and environment\\". The mixing of traffic and pedestrians had created \\"the most uncivilised street in Europe\\". The report had considered running car parks, through-traffic and access roads in shallow cuttings underground while raising the shop levels over four pedestrianised storeys above it. However they concluded that this had already become impractical ‚Äî for a generation at least ‚Äî because of piecemeal redevelopment. Should this practice continue, the only choice would be ultimately to curtail vehicular access to the street. Leeds ‚Äì A large city Briggate, Leeds's pedestrianised shopping centre Urban dual carriageways Leeds, as a large city, was too large to accommodate all the potential traffic, and it should instead attempt to curtail access, particularly private vehicles being used for commuting. Leeds embraced the approach and adopted the motto Motorway city of the 70s after it built an Outer Ring Road, a sunken part-motorway Inner Ring Road and a clockwise-only 'loop road' enclosing a part-pedestrianised city centre with several business and shopping centres. The protection and redevelopment of the city centre came at the cost of the large landtake required for the network of corridor roads and interchanges, predominantly at ground level, which required extensive demolition and severed the previous urban and suburban communities. Newbury ‚Äì a small town Newbury was chosen as an example of a small town that could be redeveloped following this pattern, with vehicles easily integrating into the urban scenery. But the report warned that the commitment and scale of work required would be hitherto unheard of. The concept was mainly ignored for 25 years until the A34 Newbury bypass was proposed, alongside extensive pedestrianisation and road changes within the urban areas. The new roads dramatically reduced the impact of motor vehicles on the town, especially heavy goods vehicles, and accompanied the reinvigoration of Newbury which had managed to retain its historic core. When completed in 1998 the actual bypass followed approximately the same route as the original proposal, but encountered such protest from so many quarters that all other UK road schemes were soon stalled. As a result, the government and Highways Agency changed its policies and assessment criteria to evenly balance predictions of schemes' environmental impact with their economic, community and safety benefits Norwich ‚Äì an ancient town Norwich, as an ancient town, could retain its historic areas but this would be at the cost of reduced vehicular access. Response and legacy The RAC recognised that some conclusions were unpalatable, and controversial, but overall they welcomed the approach. However, they thought that restrictions on vehicular traffic would be acceptable to the motorist if they could see the government determined to build capacity in urban areas. The Pedestrian Association cautioned that \\"the Judgment of Solomon\\" would be needed to decide how to implement the ideas in the report. The Parliamentary transport committee welcomed the report, as it offered an alternative to simply building more roads or providing more public transport. Thus it gained political currency, with the report forming the blueprint for UK urban planning for the next few decades. In doing so, it gave acceptability and confidence to a number of proposals and innovations that soon became common in the UK landscape: * urban clearways, flyovers, and the widespread used of single yellow and double yellow lines to limit the intrusion of vehicles in town centres * pedestrianised precincts * pedestrian city centres flanked with multi-storey car parks * one-way streets and traffic restrictions * separation of pedestrians and traffic, with clearly defined kerbs and pedestrian barriers Buchanan later proposed a development for Bath using the same approach to reduce traffic in the historical city centre by way of underground routes; this provoked such a storm of local protest that \\"Buchanan's Tunnel\\" was never built. The recognition that road congestion could not be addressed just through new road programmes influenced the way that traffic problems would be addressed in future; there would now be a switch towards \\"transport studies\\" which should consider multi-modal solutions, i.e. both road and public transport options, including park and ride. However, in the absence of a central commitment to public transport the perspective was skewed in favour of road building for many years to come. By 1970 the government had committed to spend ¬£4 bn on road schemes to \\"eliminate congestion\\" over the next 15 years. However, this switch to a multi-modal approach took some time to become widely accepted, and meanwhile many grand road schemes were being planned. By 1970 there were plans to spend ¬£1,700 million on multiple Ringways and elevated radial roads across London. Robert Vigars, the chairman of the Greater London Council's Planning committee, reported that the plan for a part-buried Ringway 2 to supersede the South Circular Road between the A2 and A23 would necessitate the destruction of several thousand houses, but it was: > ...not just a traffic solution but a plan for the very people whose areas it > passes through. It means creating living standards for them, so that they > can live, breathe, shop and eat free from the menace of traffic congestion > in their local streets. This was putting Buchanan into action ... We are > satisfied that the total planning and environmental gains greatly outweigh > the local difficulties. =Criticisms= As towns were developed according to the Buchanan blueprint, several issues emerged. * Some of the grand plans that were called for have had a poor reputation in their implementation; to be able to predict future trends, mix social development, transport skills, and economic regeneration while performing slum clearance has often been beyond the capability of the local planners. Public accountability required by local government officers was sometimes stretched, with accusations of corruption involving private sector developers and contractors who put the plans into action. The cost inflation of schemes conspired with fluctuation of the property market, and its subsequent collapse in the early 1970s, left many plans incomplete. When economic conditions improved conservation had once again become fashionable and confidence in the need for these centrally-controlled grand plans had evaporated. M23 towards London. Work stopped in the 1970s * The courage needed to develop the schemes required a lot of political will, and that would sometimes falter. By failing to identify cheaper alternatives when the financial case weakened, \\"do-nothing\\" often became the default action. For example, the extensive plans to develop a series of orbital and distribution roads into central London resulted in the construction of the A40(M) Westway, the M41 cross route and A102(M) Blackwall tunnel. However, the wide impact of these schemes caused such controversy during the 1970s that many associated road schemes ran into concerted opposition. After the 1973 oil crisis, remaining schemes fell into limbo, casting a planning blight over the affected areas for a decade or more until they were finally laid to rest. The recognition of environmental factors was also lacking in the 1960s; the report's considerations were more about the human environment, rather than the natural issues which have tended to confound some subsequent road proposals. * More latterly, the policy has been accused as being one of \\"predict and provide\\", or of building new roads in a congested network that generate even more traffic, rather than just meeting existing demand. This is to partly misrepresent the policy recommendations; although neither traffic generation and the deterrent effect of congestion, nor the mechanisms by which a business would choose to (re-)locate his premises was understood at the time, the report strove to strike a balance for situations when capacity demands could not or should not be met. Buchanan later claimed that radical urban surgery was almost the opposite of what he was proposing: > ...in spite of all the effort, it was widely misinterpreted ‚Ä¶ the Report was > a description of the choices open, from 'do nothing to whole hog', with the > advantages and disadvantages set out. * In some schemes, the separation of different types of road users would often be taken to extremes: by moving motor vehicles onto dedicated routes, their interaction with pedestrians or cycle routes might occur less often but would do so at higher speeds than before, thus creating an environment that was far more hazardous or intimidating for those not in cars. New towns like Milton Keynes could avoid this by placing motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians on separate levels and routes. However, their interaction would be a particular problem in established towns, especially in the transition to suburban areas where separation would be more ambiguous and inconsistent. In the search for low traffic casualty rates, urban planners now look to detailed road designs and traffic calming to counteract this effect, reducing vehicle speeds, or taking the more dramatic step of eliminating separation and mixing all road users together through shared space planning. * At the heart of many of the new schemes was architecture of poor quality or poor design, and a poor understanding of the effects of the new road network. As warned by Buchanan, the detailed implementation of many of these schemes critically affected their success or failure. Subsequent research has shown that more is needed than a pedestrian centre with glass shop fronts, accompanied by a hope that people will come and social life flourish. One of the recommendations, that of integrating low-level roads with developments on top, has been largely ignored; the costs and commitments needed for multi-level developments have been prohibitive in old town centres, especially when cheaper alternatives or out of town sites have presented themselves. New developments were often made in a fashionable modernist or brutalist style which rapidly dated, while the planners had not fully considered the social or economic factors that could lead to urban decay. The corridor or distribution roads would often have minimal overpasses or grade separation, with communities separated, or blighted by noise and fumes. Drivers would refuse to be neatly compartmentalised into \\"travelling\\" along the corridor roads and \\"living\\" on the local roads, leading to businesses closing outside the prime sites. * Actual traffic growth has not been as extreme as envisaged in the report (although Buchanan did warn that he had selecting the more pessimistic projections). In 1963 36% of households had a car, by 1998 this had grown to 72%, considerably less than predicted. This pattern of inaccuracy was a frequent problem with early transport schemes, which often overestimated vehicle ownership by about 20%, leading to a suspicion that the schemes were often motivated by a feeling that they were important for \\"modernisation\\" for their own sake. =Influences= Darlington, a modern interpretation of a pedestrian centre with restricted car access The design of modern town schemes has been informed by the earlier policy decisions ‚Äì and mistakes ‚Äì in Britain, Europe and further afield. Auckland, for example, commissioned a plan from Buchanan for its road policies. By the mid 1970s it was evident that the previous focus on road traffic element was not enough; transport schemes were forced to widen the study area to include land use changes, and the effects of public transport, which continued to decline in popularity. This came to a head in 1976 when Nottingham rejected plans for new urban highways in favour of another (later also rejected) scheme to place access restrictions on cars entering the city centre. Instead, authorities' efforts were put to work improving the forecasting models, adjust local traffic management to squeeze more out of the current road system, directing heavy lorries away from minor roads, or subsidising public transport, which was now carrying fewer passengers and becoming uneconomic. The roads programme was scaled back to half its previous size mainly because of poor public finances, and urban regeneration became much more locally driven through \\"Strategic Plans\\". Although many public policies and transport planners have promoted the creation of capacity-oriented solutions, organisations such as The Urban Motorways Committee (1972) adopted the need to respect the urban fabric. This movement has developed into a recognition of the need to effectively manage the demand for transport. Subsequent government planning policy on sustainable development adopted as consequence of the 1992 Earth Summit means that the concepts of vehicle restriction first mooted by Buchanan are slowly moving to the forefront of UK government policy. This has placed emphasis on alternatives to the private motor car, but has also embraced other techniques of restriction. Smeed's report of 1964 had proposed congestion charging as technically feasible, although Buchanan's recommendation had largely dismissed it. It took four decades for it to become politically acceptable in the UK, although this was not without controversy. Buchanan's concept of segregated zones or precincts, as pedestrian or local vehiclar areas, was derived from Assistant Commissioner H. Alker Tripp of Scotland Yard's Traffic Division. Buchanan's articulation of this concept encouraged the planners of the Dutch towns of Emmen and Delft, who were developing the concept of the woonerf, or living street, and decades later this was fed back to Britain, as the \\"home zone\\". Cities in the USA slowly came round to respond to the problems that Buchanan identified in 1963. A notable example is the elevated freeway system built in the late 1950s to provide extra capacity for Boston's traffic, which, at enormous financial cost, was demolished and rebuilt underground many decades later thus creating road capacity, urban pedestrian space, and reuniting displaced communities.

It was the first of several Islamic movements ‚Äì including Islamic secularism, Islamism, and Salafism ‚Äì that emerged in the middle of the 19th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time, especially the perceived onslaught of Western civilization and colonialism on the Muslim world. Founders include Muhammad Abduh, a Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death in 1905, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, and Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935).

Al- Rahim (January 2006). \\"Islam and Liberty\\", Journal of Democracy 17 (1), p. 166-169. Some have said Abduh's ideas are congruent to Mu'tazilism. Abduh himself denied being either Ashari or a Mutazilite, although he only denied being a Mutazilite on the basis that he rejected strict taqlid to one group.Sedgwick, Mark. Muhammad Abduh. Simon and Schuster, 2014. \\"By his own later account, Muhammad Abduh denied following the Mutazila on the basis that if he had rejected strict adherence (taqlid) to one group, he would not take up strict adherence to another. =Trends= Some trends in modern Islamic thought include: * The acknowledgement \\"with varying degrees of criticism or emulation\\", of the technological, scientific and legal achievements of the West, while at the same time objecting \\"to Western colonial exploitation of Muslim countries and the imposition of Western secular values\\" and aiming to develop a modern and dynamic understanding of science among Muslims that would strengthen the Muslim world and prevent further exploitation. * Invocation of the \\"objectives\\" of Islamic law (maqasid al-sharia) in support of \\"public interest\\", (or maslahah, a secondary source for Islamic jurisprudence).Djamil 1995, 60Mausud 2005 This was done by Islamic reformists in \\"many parts of the globe to justify initiatives not addressed in classical commentaries but regarded as of urgent political and ethical concern.\\"Hallaq 2011Opwis 2007 * Reinterpreting traditional Islamic law using the four traditional sources of Islamic jurisprudence ‚Äì the Quran, the reported deeds and sayings of Muhammad (hadith), consensus of the theologians (ijma) and juristic reasoning by analogy (qiyas), plus another source ijtihad ( independent reasoning to find a solution to a legal question). ** Taking and reinterpreting the first two sources (the Quran and ahadith) \\"to transform the last two [(ijma and qiyas)] in order to formulate a reformist project in light of the prevailing standards of scientific rationality and modern social theory.\\" ** Restricting traditional Islamic law by limiting its basis to the Quran and authentic Sunnah, limiting the Sunna with radical hadith criticism. **Employing ijtihad not to only in the traditional, narrow way to arrive at legal rulings in unprecedented cases (where Quran, hadith, and rulings of earlier jurists are silent), but for critical independent reasoning in all domains of thought, and perhaps even approving of its use by non-jurists. * A more or less radical (re)interpretation of the authoritative sources. This is particularly the case with the Quranic verses on polygyny, the hadd (penal) punishments, jihad, and treatment of unbelievers, banning of usury or interest on loans (riba), which conflict with \\"modern\\" views. **On the issue of jihad, modernists such as Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, took a different line than \\"traditionalist- classicist\\" scholars, emphasizing that jihad was allowed only as defensive warfare to respond to aggression or \\"perfidy\\" against the Muslim community, and that the \\"normal and desired state\\" between Islamic and non-Islamic territories was one of \\"peaceful coexistence.\\" According to Mahmud Shaltut and other modernists, unbelief was not sufficient cause for declaring jihad. The conversion to Islam by unbelievers in fear of death at the hands of jihadists (mujahideen) was unlikely to prove sincere or lasting. Much preferable means of conversion was education. They pointed to the verse \\"No compulsion is there in religion\\" **On the issue of riba, Syed Ahmad Khan, Fazlur Rahman Malik, Muhammad Abduh, Rashid Rida, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri, Muhammad Asad, Mahmoud Shaltout all took issue with the jurist orthodoxy that any and all interest was riba and forbidden, believing that there was a difference between interest and usury.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 56 * An apologetic which links aspects of the Islamic tradition with Western ideas and practices, and claims Western practices in question were originally derived from Islam. Islamic apologetics has however been severely criticized by many scholars as superficial, tendentious and even psychologically destructive, so much so that the term \\"apologetics\\" has almost become a term of abuse in the literature on modern Islam. History of Modernism Commencing in the late nineteenth century and impacting the twentieth-century, Muhammed Abduh and Rashid Rida undertook a project to defend and modernize Islam to match Western institutions and social processes. Its most prominent intellectual founder, Muhammad Abduh (d. 1323 AH/1905 CE), was Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death. This project superimposed the world of the nineteenth century on the extensive body of Islamic knowledge that had accumulated in a different milieu. These efforts had little impact at first, however were catalysed with the demise of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 and promotion of secular liberalism ‚Äì particularly with a new breed of writers being pushed to the fore including Egyptian Ali Abd al-Raziq‚Äôs publication attacking Islamic politics for the first time in Muslim history. Subsequent secular writers including Farag Foda, al-Ashmawi, Muhamed Khalafallah, Taha Husayn, Husayn Amin, et. al., have argued in similar tones. Abduh was skeptical towards Hadith (or \\"Traditions\\"), i.e. towards the body of reports of the teachings, doings, and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Particularly towards those Traditions that are reported through few chains of transmission, even if they are deemed rigorously authenticated in any of the six canonical books of Hadith (known as the Kutub al-Sittah). Furthermore, he advocated a reassessment of traditional assumptions even in Hadith studies, though he did not devise a systematic methodology before his death.The Modernist Approach to Hadith Studies By Noor al-Deen Atabek onislam.net 30 March 2005 =Influence on Muslim Brotherhood= The \\"early Salafiyya\\" (Modernists) influenced Islamist movements like Muslim BrotherhoodSalafi oxfordislamicstudies.com and to some extent Jamaat-e-Islami.

Described as Islamic Modernist, it emphasized the authority of the Qur'an and the Hadiths, opposing syncretism and taqlid to the ulema. However, as of 2006, it is said to have \\"veered sharply toward a more conservative brand of Islam\\" under the leadership of Din Syamsuddin the head of the Indonesian Ulema Council. In Indonesia, Islam loves democracy Michael Vatikiotis  New York Times 6 February 6, 2006 Connection with the contemporary Salafism Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, Muhammad Rashid Rida and, to a lesser extent, Mohammed al- Ghazali took some ideals of Wahhabism, such as endeavor to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to the Islamic understanding of the first Muslim generations (Salaf) by reopening the doors of juristic deduction (ijtihad) that they saw as closed. Some historians believe modernists used the term \\"Salafiyya\\" for their movement (although this is strongly disputed by at least one scholar ‚Äì Henri Lauzi√®re). Toward the end of the twentieth century, however, the term \\"Salafi movement\\" became associated with the Wahhabism, and strongly antithetical to Islamic modernismThe past ten day Salafi led unrest in reaction to an anti-Islamic video spread through the Muslim world, here a look at who is behind it. world news research 21 September 2012 which is seen as forbidden innovation (bidah).

Supporters of Salafi movement considered modernists Neo-Mu'tazila, after the medieval Islamic school of theology based on rationalism, Mu'tazila. Critics argue that the modernist thought is little more than the fusion of Western Secularism with spiritual aspects of Islam. Other critics have described the modernist positions on politics in Islam as ideological stances. One of the leading Islamist thinkers and Islamic revivalists, Abul A'la Maududi agreed with Islamic modernists that Islam contained nothing contrary to reason, and was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems. However he disagreed with them in their examination of the Quran and the Sunna using reason as the standard. Maududi, instead started from the proposition that \\"true reason is Islamic\\", and accepted the Book and the Sunna, not reason, as the final authority. Modernists erred in examining rather than simply obeying the Quran and the Sunna. Critics argue politics is inherently embedded in Islam, a rejection of the Christian and secular principle of \\"Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's\\". They claim that there is a consensus in Muslim political jurisprudence, philosophy and practice with regard to the Caliphate form of government with a clear structure comprising a Caliph, assistants (mu‚Äôawinoon), governors (wulaat), judges (qudaat) and administrators (mudeeroon).Nabhani, T, \\"The Islamic Ruling System\\", al-Khilafah PublicationsMawardi, \\"Ahkaam al-Sultaniyyah\\". It is argued that Muslim jurists have tended to work with the governments of their times. Notable examples are Abu Yusuf, Mohammed Ibn al-Hasan, Shafi‚Äôi, Yahya bin Said, Abu Hamid al- Ghazali, Ismail bin Yasa, Ibn Tulun, Abu Zura, Abu Hasan al-Mawardi and Tabari.Hallaq, W, ‚ÄúThe Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law‚Äù, Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp.173-6, 182-7Salahi, A, ‚ÄúPioneers of Islamic Scholarship‚Äù, The Islamic Foundation, 2006, pp. 51-2 Prominent theologians would counsel the Caliph in discharging his Islamic duties, often on the request of the incumbent Caliph. Many rulers provided patronage to scholars across all disciplines, the most famous being the Abassids who funded extensive translation programmes and the building of libraries.

For a mobile application, the OC is defined by the hardware and software environment in the device, the target user, and other constraints imposed by various other stakeholders, such as a carrier. This concept differs from the operating system (OS) by the impact of these various other stakeholders. Example Here is an example of one device, with one operating system, changing its operating context without changing the OS. A user with a mobile phone changes SIM cards, removing card A, and inserting card B. The phone will now make any network calls over cell phone carrier B's network, rather than A's. Any applications running on the phone will run in a new operating context, and will often have to change functionality to adapt to the abilities, and business logic, of the new carrier. The network, spectrum, and wireless protocol all change in this example. These changes must be reflected back to the user, so the user knows what experience to expect, and thus these changes all change the user interface (UI) also.  Hardware agnostic context  Situations exist where one can program in a context, with less concern about what hardware it will actually run on. Examples include Flash and Android. Unfortunately, it also quite common that code in a hardware free context will see hardware specific bugs. This is common with software written for, that interacts more directly with, personal computer (PC) hardware, or mobile phones.

Biography Bineth was born in Szombathely, Hungary, the grandson of the scholar Jacob Obermeyer. He grew up in K√∂ln, Germany, from 1919 until 1935, when he and his parents left Nazi Germany and emigrated to Palestine. Meir's last duty and mission was as an Israeli intelligence spy (Secret Fighter) in Egypt, from 1952 to the end of 1954. He was sent there undercover as a German businessman, representing various German firms ‚Äì primarily \\"von Laufenberg\\", a firm manufacturing equipment for the disabled and crippled. He was the first Israeli intelligence agent sent to an enemy country under a German identity, and was likely partly selected due to his early years in Germany. Meir's mission in Egypt was to gather information for Israeli Intelligence about the strength of the Egyptian army, the power of the military industry, Egyptian strategy and intentions toward Israel, the activities of significant anti- Israeli bodies, propaganda, etc. Many doors of Egypt's top military echelon opened before him; he became acquainted with General Muhammad Naguib, then President of Egypt. He also built relations with German military and intelligence personnel and ranking ex-Nazi \\"advisors\\" who had found refuge in Egypt after the Second World War. Some of them were scientists who were helping Egypt develop missiles that could potentially threaten Israel. While working in Egypt, Meir was nominated as a consultant engineer at the \\"Anglo Egyptian Motors Company\\" (the German branch of the Ford Motor Company in Egypt), and suggested several projects to help improve Egypt's economy, believing that a crucial reason that generates wars between nations and communities is the lack of economic and social equilibrium; among other things he wrote in his prison cell for his defense was the line \\"I think that the principal cause of wars is the age-old fear existing between man and communities that there may not be enough bread for all.\\" Meir's cover and conduct were perfect‚Äîhe had German citizenship, grew up with German culture, literature, and music, and German was his mother tongue. During the last seven months of his secret mission in Egypt, his wife Jane (South African in origin) and daughter joined him. Bineth was caught and arrested after the failure of false flag Operation Susannah, an incident later known as the Lavon Affair. Meir had been ordered by a senior officer in Israel to deliver money for the groups' needs and had met Marcelle Ninio a few times. Ninio was the last to be caught; under torture she gave a description of Meir's car, which led to his capture. After five months of interrogation and torture, on the day before his trial, Meir committed suicide in his prison cell (his wife and child were in Europe). He realized that there was no way out for him and did not want to give the Egyptians the pleasure of hanging him in public, which was the fate awaiting him after conviction. His body was re-interred in the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem in 1959.

The film stars David A. R. White and Kevin Downes as FBI agents caught up in the world of the Rapture. Written and directed by Wes Llewelyn, the film was a popular success, becoming a bestseller among Christian film audiences warranting a sequel, The Moment After 2: The Awakening, seven years later. It was a Crown Award Winner for Best Evangelistic Film and Best Drama film made for less than $250,000.Christian Cinema  Summary  The movie opens up at an empty house. A phone has been dropped, with the dial tone still going, a pot is still cooking on the stove, a television is still on, indicating a person was still watching it, and clothes are still on the seat. Outside the scene is chaotic with a panicked mother frantically looking for her daughter and a man looking for his wife after a car crash. The movie switches to the house of Adam Riley (White), who is visited by his friend Charles Baker (Downes). They are FBI agents working at the same field office. At the FBI headquarters, agents are briefed and are given an assignment, a folder containing names, and told to interview the relatives of the missing people. These include Mr. Fulton, a live in nurse named Peggy, and Katherine, George's wife (whose two kids Troy and Tanya are also among the missing). As they are leaving, Charles is called back to the emergency room when finds that his wife has miscarried. A Jewish rabbi named Jacob Krause (Brad Heller) is at Synagogue performing a ritual, and picks up a Bible upon hearing the news report on the radio. Jacob suddenly takes up residence in an abandoned Christian homeless shelter (later this is closed down and he has continually run ins with the military). Katherine at the hospital is told that four months have passed and she has shown improvement in her performance. While waiting outside on a bench, Krause comes and preaches the Word of God. The President makes a State of the Union speech, addressing the recent events. He then declares a One World Currency and the installation of a B-chip, which is implanted through the palm and ‚Äúacts as a credit card‚Äù. Just when Adam and Charles are close to finding answers to the puzzle, the President orders all FBI agents to be taken off the case. Adam and Charles are given the task to capture Krause, considered to be a ‚Äúdangerous criminal‚Äù. Adam and Charles proceed to Krause's last known location, but the only evidence they find is a picture. An argument erupts between them, leading Charles to drive home. Later that night, Riley goes to see Dr. Wilkins at his church. He asks him about his theory of the rapture, mentioning a debate between him and two scholars on television. Wilkins correctly deduces that Krause is one of the 144,000 who will convert those left behind to God himself. Adam and Charles go back to Krause's location, and Charles is angry that Riley is going on a ‚Äúhunch‚Äù based on the picture. He then reveals some writing on the back, and that the message was for him to find: SEEK, AND YOU SHALL FIND. However, on their way, they meet up with the military as Riley squares off with Lt. Fredricks (Monte Perlin). They discover that the military has captured Katherine, and Adam breaks her out. She is soon discovered and a standoff occurs at a diner. Katherine has both agents lower their weapons and says she's ready and that God will be there to protect her. She sings as the military leave the diner, but not before Fredricks threatens Adam. Adam and Charles arrive at the mountaintop where they discover Krause alone. Adam tells him to go easy on Krause, however Charles arrests Krause at gun point, citing his orders. Krause is able to convince Adam, but not Charles, that the ‚ÄúB‚Äù in the B-chip stands for Beast and that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is true. They stop at a local gas station, where Adam fills up the gas tank while Charles goes inside. Krause finally gets Adam to believe in God, and helps him out in his escape. He drives the car off, leaving Charles there. Charles calls Adam's cell, and after getting a nonsensical answer from him, borrows a car. The military blocks Adam's car from proceeding further. The guard checks Adam's ID, but reveals it has been blocked. Before Adam could proceed further, Charles stops him and convinces the military he's harboring a fugitive. When they look in the trunk of his car, they find nothing. Charles knows Krause was released, and Adam is taken to prison by the military. The final scenes show Charles packing his stuff at his desk, indicating he was fired, and Adam receiving his dinner from a fellow prison guard Adam takes the bread, and finds a piece of paper with Bible passages. He goes to the window with his arms spread out. Krause goes back up to the mountain, indicating that his journey is far from over.

The university is named after Russian admiral Stepan Makarov, who was born in the city. History NUS student initiation ceremony. Rector of the NUS Serhiy Ryzhkov at a student initiation ceremony. Serhiy Ryzhkov with Wang Zili, president of China's Jiangsu University of Science and Technology. In April 1901, the Ministry of National Education of the Russian Empire announced the Mykolaiv Industrial Technical School. The school opened on 1 July 1902 at 3 Kuznechnaia Street (now 5 Skorohodova Street) marking the beginnings of the NUS. Teaching began on 18 September 1902 with courses including shipbuilding, mechanics, electrics and road building that was carried out in a department of works and in the school itself. The school had the status of a higher education institution: after three years of study, graduating students received the qualification of engineer. In 1926 and 1927, the school was reorganised to teach technical shipbuilding and the course of study was lengthened to four years. The school was equipped with laboratories for metallurgy, chemistry, thermodynamics and engineering. In 1929 the Mykolaiv Shipbuilding Technical School was merged with the Mykolaiv Technical Night School and renamed the Mykolaiv Machine-Building Institute and in 1930, in association with the ship building department of the Odessa Polytechnic Institute, it was renamed the Mykolaiv Shipbuilding Institute (MSI). In 1941, at the Soviet Union's entry into World War II, the MSI employed 94 teachers and was training almost 700 students. Approximately 500 students, teachers and employees were conscripted to the Red Army and sent to the front. Others were tasked with building defensive structures and harvesting crops. The MSI was evacuated, first to Stalingrad, then to Astrakhan and later to Przhevalsk, Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. During the war, the MSI maintained 22 departments and trained 370 students. On 30 June 1944, it was decided to return the MSI to Mykolaiv and on 1 October 1944, it reopened. In 1945, 36.5 million khrb was allocated to a five-year plan of restoration and development. In 1946, the MSI was accredited for postgraduate study in marine engineering and steam and internal combustion engine design. Links were made with other institutes of science. In 1949, the MSI was renamed Admiral Makarov MSI for Stepan Makarov, a native of Mykolaiv, a naval admiral, and a marine engineer. By 1955, over eighty percent of the teachers at the Admiral Marakov MSI were involved in research. 18 September 1970 marked the 50th anniversary of the school and by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the school was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for merit in preparation of engineering workers and for its achievements in the development of scientists. On 17 May 1971, a new building was opened and work was begun on the construction of a thirteen-story hostel that would house 1295 students. In 1971, 50 economists of engineering graduated. In 1994, by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Admiral Makarov National Shipbuilding University received the highest level of accreditation, (level four), which gave it the status of a university and it adopted the new name, Ukrainian State Maritime Technical University. The president (chancellor) was . Then and now is Serhiy Ryzhkov. Progress Since 1941, the MSI has trained over 1700 marine engineers and altogether, 55,000 industry ready workers. The NUS has 8 institutes, 3 faculties, a school at sea, a campus in Kherson and representation in three cities of Ukraine. It has links with its community and with industry. A student population of 12,000 read in twenty-six areas and in thirty specialties. The university offers bachelor, expert and master's degrees; a doctorate of science; and academic and teacher education. The university employs 68 doctorate staff and 256 scientists specialising in new ship design, safety at sea, unmanned underwater craft, structures and works (such as welding), marine metallurgy and marine power (such as low pollution alternative energy sources for the marine industry). The university also provides certification of polymetric systems for metrological maintenance of onboard and coastal complexes; improvements of marine electric equipment and automatic systems, and methods and means of increasing the efficiency of touch maintenance and information complexes of hierarchically organised control systems. The Ukraine ministerial committee on industrial policy and education (USSTU), recognized the university as a key provider of marine welders. In association with the German organization, the NUS prepared 20 marine welders with qualifications matching European standards. On 25 March 2004, President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma gave the university a national status and it was renamed the Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding. The NUS has associations with educational institutions of other nations, giving students the opportunity to study abroad. Educational Scientific Centre of International Cooperation First-year international students of the NUS. The university's Educational Scientific Centre of International Cooperation (ESCIC) organises the NUS associations with other universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, China, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Bulgaria, Iran, Spain, Vietnam and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The ESCIC facilitates requests by NUS students for scholarships, international grants and exchanges. It liaises with, for example, the German Academic Exchange Service, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, Germany), the Fulbright Program and the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) in the US, and the Education for Democracy Foundation (Poland). International students from many nations study on a contractual basis at the NUS. Institutes * The Institute of Shipbuilding.

Release data The album was released as an LP in 1989 by AIP Records (as #AIP-10048) and as a CD in 1997 (as #AIP-CD-1048). Vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks The English Freakbeat LPs and CDs have most tracks in common, although not always in the same order, and some of the LP tracks were not included on the CDs. Also, the CD bonus tracks are not always at the end of the album. Thus, for clarity, we have shown tracks for both editions of the album, with vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks indicated. Notes on the tracks The following information is taken mostly from the CD liner notes. The In Crowd included some stellar players: Twink, previously of the Fairies who was also the drummer for the Pretty Things for a time and later a founding member of the Pink Fairies; Steve Howe, later of Yes and a bandmate of Twink in the Fairies; and vocalist Keith West. \\"Why Must They Criticize\\" is from their last single in late 1965; shortly thereafter, the band changed its name to Tomorrow and went on to release one of the classic psychedelic rock albums of the 1960s. Dean Maverick real name \\"Pete Harper\\" was the singer in (beat band) The Attraction of ( Romford Harold Hill & Dagenham ). This song is from the flip side of their second single; the \\"A\\" side, a cover of the Kinks' \\"Party Line\\" was produced by Dave Davies (whose early band the Ravens is also featured on this disk). The Thoughts started out as a back-up band for acts like Paul Dean, Tiffany and Johnny & John. While the classic \\"A\\" side of their single, \\"All Night Long\\" has been compiled several times, this is the first re-appearance of the flip. \\"Take Away\\" by the Couriers is taken from their only single; the \\"B\\" side is on English Freakbeat, Volume 1. Several more recordings by the Sons of Fred are included on English Freakbeat, Volume 4. The Sons of Fred who recorded at E.M.I. Studios, later Abbey Road Studios included guitarist Mick Hutchinson, and Pete Sears on bass. Sears went on to record bass or piano with many artists including Long John Baldry, Stoneground, Silver Metre, Rod Stewart, John Cipollina, Jefferson Starship, Nick Gravenites, John Lee Hooker, Hot Tuna and Moonalice. Sons of Fred also performed on 1960 television shows like Thank Your Lucky Stars, and Ready Steady Goes Live. The Mockingbirds are a predecessor band to 10cc and already included both Graham Gouldman and Kevin Godley. This cut is from their last of five singles. The bandmembers of the Raving Savages ‚Äì who backed Screaming Lord Sutch ‚Äì included Deep Purple co- founder Ritchie Blackmore and sideman extraordinaire Nicky Hopkins. This cover of the Jan & Dean classic \\"Surf City\\" comes from a 1963 surf EP that the band released under their own name in the same time period. The numerous rarities that populate the bonus tracks on the second half of the CD more than make up for the three LP cuts that are omitted. Although they would eventually evolve into the Kinks, the bandleader for the Ravens was Dave Davies before the even greater genius in younger brother Ray was evident. The second and third tracks sound like \\"the Kinks unplugged\\", while the first is an excellent cover of one of the coolest Leiber/Stoller songs, \\"I'm a Hog for You\\". The Talismen released one 45 that includes \\"Casting My Spell\\", while \\"What Kind of Boy\\" comes from a very rare Italian album by the band; the producer is Shel Talmy. \\"Keep Me Covered\\" is the flip side of the first single by the Frays; they followed that up with a cover of \\"My Girl Sloopy\\". Bandmember Mike Patto was later in Timebox, Patto and several other bands. Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich is a fairly well known bubblegum group; this track was evidently released only in Germany in connection with the band's appearance at the legendary Star Club in Hamburg (where the Beatles gained early prominence).

Translations English translations of \\"Doklady\\" articles began again in 1956, when the American Institute of Physics began publishing Soviet Physics - Doklady. Other publications soon followed and within a few years most Doklady subject sections were available in English translation. Doklady translation journals are as of 2013 published by Pleiades Publishing, Ltd and distributed online by Springer Science+Business Media. The online translation journals now only publish \\"selected\\" articles from the original Russian language journal, which is also available online from 2006.Doklady Akademii Nauk (0869-5652). Determining the appropriate English translation journal for articles published in ‚ÄòDoklady‚Äô is often problematic. One approach is to check the Russian Doklady issue contents page to identify the subject section and then determine in which translation journal the article was published. The translation journal‚Äôs contents pages will provide a concordance linking the ‚ÄòDoklady‚Äô page numbers with the ‚Äòtranslation journal‚Äô page numbers. Another approach is to search SciFinder for the original article, which may show the Doklady subject section,Oxidation of carbon monoxide in acetic acid; Moiseev, I. I.; Vargaftik, M. N.; Gentosh, O. I.; et al.; Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR (1977), 237(3), 645-7 [Phys.

In the game, two players each control paddles on either side of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped from the top of the screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings. Development of Rebound began in late 1973, as one of several variations they produced in 1974 on the gameplay of the successful Pong (1972), Atari's first game and the fourth-ever arcade game. Around the same time, Atari launched Kee Games, a subsidiary meant to produce clone games of Atari's products and act as a competitor in order to expand into more distribution channels in the same region than the industry typically supported. Kee's first game, released in March 1974, was Spike, a clone of Rebound, which added a \\"spike\\" button to the game that made the paddle jump up and attempt to bounce the ball downwards instead of up. In addition to the base game, Atari sold a conversion kit to convert any Atari two-player Pong variant into Rebound, and in 1977 Rebound was included in Video Olympics for the Atari 2600, a collection of Pong variants. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay; the two players are tied at 0 points, the net is at its lowest level, and the ball is falling from the top towards the left side. Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game in which the players, each controlling a paddle representing a person on either side of a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped from the top of the screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game. If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen without being deflected by a paddle, bounces on the same paddle four times, hits the net, or is deflected into the side of the screen, then a sound is played and a point is awarded to the player on the opposing side. After a point is scored, the ball is dropped from the top of the screen again. Every two times the ball is bounced across the net by the players without a point being scored the net is grows slightly higher, up to ten times; it resets in height when a point is scored. Two large numbers at the top of the screen record the points for each player. Each game costs a quarter, and machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game. Rounds can be set to play until a player reaches either eleven or fifteen points. Whenever a game is won, the game resets into its \\"attract mode\\", where the paddles are stretched across the screen, allowing the ball to bounce along to the side and be re-dropped indefinitely. Atari subsidiary Kee Games made a version of the game named Spike, which was functionally almost identical with the addition of a \\"spike\\" button; this button made the player's paddle jump into the air, potentially bouncing the ball into a downward trajectory like a volleyball spike. Development A Spike arcade cabinet, featuring a different cabinet than Rebound but nearly identical graphics and controls, with the addition of two \\"spike' buttons. Rebound was developed by Atari, Inc. beginning in late 1973; the final schematics are dated November 31, 1973, and use the code name \\"Volleyball\\". 1973 was near the beginning of the start of the arcade game industry; after the success of Atari's Pong (1972), the first game by the new company and fourth arcade game ever produced, the nascent industry was largely composed of variations on the concept, called \\"ball-and-paddle games\\". While Atari created games with other gameplay types in 1973 and 1974, such as Space Race (1973) and Gran Trak 10 (1974), it also created several Pong-like games. Rebound was a variation on that theme, featuring controls and gameplay similar to Pong, with the addition of gravity arcing the ball and both paddles moved to the bottom of the screen. Rebound was released by Atari in February 1974, with a release announcement on February 16. Other Atari ball-and-paddle games from 1974 include Superpong and Quadrapong, both of which were variations on the original Pong gameplay. The arcade game market is split into manufacturers, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors‚Äîwho handle several types of electronic machines‚Äîwho in turn sell them to the operators of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only the operators that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 just over a year old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. The first such game by Kee, released in March 1974, was Spike, a clone of Rebound with the addition of the \\"spike\\" button that made the paddle jump up to attempt to knock the ball downwards; other than that addition it is functionally the same game. Legacy Rebound has been described by Retro Gamer as one of the more notable Pong variants. Despite this, unlike many other games of the time Atari did not make a sequel game. Sales numbers are not available for Rebound or Spike; additionally, a table made in 1976 by Ralph H. Baer in his book Videogames: In the Beginning containing sales numbers for most games of the time period does not contain any numbers for the two games. In addition to the stand-alone game, Atari sold conversion kits which could modify any two-player Pong variant they produced into a Rebound game. The kits included a circuit board to plug in to the existing game and decal stickers to cover up the original name on the cabinets with \\"Rebound\\". In 1977, Rebound was included as one of the games in Video Olympics for the Atari 2600 home video game console, a collection of Pong variants, as \\"Volleyball\\".

It stars Natalie Brown as Sophie Parker, an unmarried single mother and talent agent. The show is an English-language adaptation of T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada's show Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin. The show was created by Richard Blaimert and its executive producer is Jocelyn Desch√™nes, the same creative team behind the original series. It was the CBC's second attempt in as many years to create an English adaptation of a successful series from its French sister network, following the less successful Rumours.Our Public Airwaves.ca - CBC TV tries again to adapt French comedy In February 2008, it was announced that the show had been bought by ABC Family, part of Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group in the United States. The network signed on for the first 13 episodes, as well as an option for the second season of the show.ABC Family buys CBC comedy Sophie CBC News, February 5, 2008 On March 27, 2009, the series was cancelled by CBC due to poor ratings.'Sophie' was canceled due to low ratings Characters * Sophie Parker (Natalie Brown) is a businesswoman and single mother who runs her own talent agency. Just hours after being told by a psychic that she was about to have the worst year of her life, her boyfriend Rick ran off with her best friend Melissa while Sophie was still pregnant with what she and Rick thought was Rick's baby. Soon afterward, she gave birth and discovered that the baby (named Robert) couldn't be Rick's child after all: he's half black. It turns out Robbie was conceived in a one-night stand Sophie had with Andr√© (played by Lyriq Bent in flashbacks), whom she met in a cab in New York City. At first, she did not have any contact with him and went as far as shredding his business card. But in the first season finale, he would later show up to see her, and upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment. * Rick Ryder (Sebastian Spence) is Sophie's ex- boyfriend and former business partner who now runs his own competing talent agency which stole most of Sophie's clients. Despite the end of their relationship, however, they can't seem to get away from each other, in part because Sophie's mother is constantly plotting to reunite them. His continued presence in Sophie's life also complicates her efforts to find a new boyfriend: in one episode, he accidentally sees Melissa giving Sophie's current love interest a few pointers on how Sophie likes to be flirted with, mistakes him for someone Melissa is seeing behind his back, and later punches him in the face at a gallery show. In the first season finale, he almost asked Melissa to marry him, but when that failed he saw Sophie crying over being rejected by Andr√© and as they were about to go get a drink, he sees Andr√© walking towards the two. * Melissa Bryant (Amy Lalonde) is Sophie's former best friend and Rick's current girlfriend. A bit ditzy, she still thinks of Sophie as a dear friend ‚Äî even helping her to line up dates and begging her to dogsit ‚Äî and is unaware of how much she hurt Sophie by stealing Rick. She dotes on her dog like a baby, sometimes giving it more attention and TLC than she gives Rick. In the first season finale, Rick tried to ask Melissa to marry him, only to have the two argue, resulting in Rick leaving and Melissa furious. * Matt Scott (Jeff Geddis) is Sophie's gay best friend and confidant. Although in a relationship with Verner, a Swiss immigrant, he is not entirely committed to it and also has an eye for Bernard, a waiter at the caf√© where he and Sophie hang out, and eventually slept with. In the end, he did confess to Verner and eventually made up by going off to Switzerland together. * Judith Parker (Mimi Kuzyk) is Sophie's manipulative control freak mother. She is determined to reunite Sophie and Rick, faking a suicide attempt so that she can insist that they take care of her together and deliberately interfering when Sophie dates anyone who isn't Rick. * Estelle Burroughs (Sara Botsford) is a pretentious and flighty actress who affects a Received Pronunciation English accent, and the only client of Sophie's agency who didn't defect to Rick's new firm (although Sophie wouldn't be upset if she did). She was also the mistress of Sophie's late father for many years (as Sophie tells Judith about why she was signed to the agency, \\"She came with the deal. He put it in the will.\\"), complicating her professional relationship with Sophie, but at times comes through for her. In one episode, Estelle played a part in getting Sophie a sought-after client after she recognized Estelle from in a play called Learning Rainbows and was a fan of Estelle. She thinks of herself as a positive force in Sophie's life, which makes one of them. * Ophelia Burroughs (Chantelle Chung) is Estelle's teenage daughter, whom Estelle adopted from China. Ophelia has no love for Estelle whatsoever. * Bridget (Catherine B√©rub√©) is Sophie's scheming receptionist, constantly trying to angle her way into a more senior job with the agency. * Christian Parker (Tyler Hynes) is Sophie's younger brother. Recently paroled from prison, he is determined to exploit his family connections to launch his own reality show depicting his experience as an ex-con readjusting to life \\"on the outside\\".

It originates from rabbits introduced to Enderby Island, an uninhabited subantarctic island in New Zealand‚Äôs Auckland Islands group, from Australia in October 1865 to serve as castaway food. Over 130 years the isolated population became a distinctive variety. The rabbits were eventually exterminated for wildlife management from Enderby Island in the early 1990s, but a breeding group of 49 rabbits was rescued by the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand in September 1992. Since then rabbit breeders have maintained numbers at around 100-150 individuals, primarily through the work of Sitereh Schouten and the Enderby Island Rabbit Club of NZ. They have ensured breed purity with pedigrees and ear tattoos which exclusively include a Z along with an individual number. Description Enderby Island Rabbits are mainly silver-grey in colour, with an undercoat of dark slate-blue. Their heads, ears and tails are very dark, sometimes black. Because of a recessive gene, a small proportion of the rabbits are born cream or beige in colour. Adult rabbits weigh about 2 kg. Kits are born black or cream then silver ticking develops at puberty. Coat colours are described as Champagne to slate (light to dark silver) and creme.

Sea Shepherd confrontations  On January 15, 2008, two members (Ben Potts and Giles Lane) of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, traveling on the MV Steve Irwin, boarded the Y≈´shin Maru No. 2 without permission.

It was founded in 1962 by the Society of Jesus. Its primary and secondary education programs are validated by the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. Its high school is affiliated with the Sistema Universitario Jesuita (SUJ).  History  ICT was founded by a group of parents who united to create a college that would offer the Catholic education given to children at other private colleges. It was the Jesuits who responded to this request, under the direction of Fr. Federico Chavez Pe√≥n, S.J., who persuaded the Jesuit Provincial Superior Fr. Lawrence O'Neill, S.J., to obtain approval from Rome. The college is dedicated to the memory of St. San Luis Gonzaga, an Italian Jesuit beatified by Paul V on October 19, 1605, and canonized on December 13, 1726, by Benedict XIII, who declared him patron of youth. The Instituto Cultural Tampico was first located in an old house in the Altavista district. It began operations in September 1962, with only a dozen male students the first year. More students joined every year until all six high school grades were filled. Although at the beginning the school accepted males only, years later females were accepted as well. In the early 70's the ICT moved its facilities to a new campus at Avenida Universidad, where it remains.Palomera, Esteban J.: La obra educativa de los jesuitas en Tampico, 1962-1987, ICT, M√©xico, 1990. .  1995 Zapatista crisis  ICT became worldwide famous because of former alumnus Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n Vicente, whom the Mexican government accepted to be the guerrilla leader Subcomandante Marcos. This theory gained traction after dissident Zapatista Comandante Salvador Morales Garibay gave to the Mexican Government the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas, among them Subcomandante Marcos.¬´El otro subcomandante¬ª The direct intervention of Rafael Guill√©n of the Instituto Cultural Tampico and his childhood friend Max Appedole played a major role in avoiding a military solution to the Zapatista crisis in 1995, when the Mexican government revealed his identity by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guill√©n, was no terrorist. Advised about the terrible consequences of a tragic outcome with a military solution in place at the Military Site at the Zapatistas camp in 1995 in Chiapas.¬´Tampico la conexion zapatista¬ª Time showed that the fight against a military solution to the conflict and the strategy to achieve a peaceful solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis was legal, politically and honorably correct, saving many lives in Mexico. Max Appedole recognized Rafael's literary style in all his manifestos that were published in the media and linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the Jesuit schools in Mexico, leaving him no doubt that Subcomandante Marcos was his friend Rafael Guill√©n, a pacifist. Max Appedole sought help from Ed√©n Pastora, \\"Commander Zero\\" of Nicaragua, to prepare a report for Mexico's Under-Secretary of the Interior Luis Maldonado Venegas, Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma, and President Ernesto Zedillo, about Subcomandante Marcos's natural pacifist vocation and the terrible consequences of a tragic outcome. Luis Maldonado Venegas achieved with Subcomandante Marcos the re-initiation of dialogue and all the necessary agreements in accordance with the law to start formal Peace Talks between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government. The charismatic leader of the Ej√©rcito Zapatista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, Marcos, led the Zapatistas to leave arms aside and begin the dialog for peace agreements with the Mexican Government. Time showed that this effort against a military solution to the conflict ‚Äì the strategy to achieve a peaceful solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis ‚Äì was legal, politically and honorably correct, and saved many lives in Mexico. Today The Instituto Cultural Tampico teaches coeducational kindergarten, elementary, and high school ‚Äì morning shift. It accepts non-Catholics, providing a rich diversity among students and teachers. Parents who promoted this project formed Impulsora Cultural A.C., a board which legally owns and operates the school. The religious subjects taught at the ICT are not part of the official curriculum (SEP), but handled as extracurricular. Facilities include fifty classrooms, several auditoriums, a chapel, a theater, computer classrooms, a cafeteria, four laboratories, sports fields, and parking lots (one underground).  Praying house Villa Manresa  Named after a town in Catalonia, Spain, where Ignatius of Loyola developed the Spiritual Exercises, the Villa Manresa was founded in 1982 by the sixth principal of the institute, Jose Quezada Guadeloupe, S.J., to serve as a retreat house where the school community could have reflections, spiritual exercises, retreats, and conferences. It includes a chapel, auditorium, classrooms, bedrooms, dining rooms, kitchen, basic services, and gardens. In each grade, students spend time there to find how God is present in the various moments of their lives, or \\"in all things\\" as Ignatius would say.  Relevance  The importance of this Institution lies in its influence in the region through social service, charitable works, legal assistance to immigrants, retreats, and conferences, and in its alumni networks. In everything we do we use five institutional values: * Magis, striving for the \\"greater\\" good, and for constant growth. * Justice in love. * Active commiseration. * Creative inspiration. * Liberty and equity. According to watchlists, thousands of alumni are actively engaged in tasks ranging from religious activism to social discussion forums that are not directly religious. Those who do remain within the Catholic movement may join ASIA (Antiqui Societatis Iesu Alumni), \\"former students of the Society of Jesus\\" (\\"Old Boys\\" before the girls joined us). These associations are not formally a part of ICT.

Kermani was executed by public hanging on August 10, 1896. Consequences Kermani's assassination of Nasser-al-Din Shah and the subsequent execution marked a turning point in Iranian political thought that would ultimately lead to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution during Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's turbulent reign; the Constitutional Revolution was the first major democratic movement in the modern Middle East, although it was preceded by the First Constitutional Era (1876‚Äì78) in the neighboring Ottoman Empire.

It explores the issues arising from the attempt by Lothar II, king of Lotharingia (855‚Äì869), to rid himself of his wife Teutberga and replace her with his concubine, Waldrada. Hincmar is primarily concerned with defining what marriage is and how (or if) it may be ended, and with the duties of bishops and of kings.

It lies on the northeast side of the municipality of Guadalajara and on the edge of the municipalities of Tonal√°, Zapotlanejo, Ixtlahuac√°n del R√≠o and Zapopan in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. Its beauty and structure make it a slightly smaller scale version of the Grand Canyon in the United States, and Barranca del Cobre in Chihuahua.Barranca de Oblatos (Jalisco) \\"Escuela Secundaria 5 Mixta U\\" It includes approximately and it has an average depth of . The difference in elevation between the rim of the canyon () and the river () is at the point of a funicular. This canyon is also named Oblatos-Huentit√°n due to the areas in the city crossed by it, called Oblatos and Huentit√°n respectively. Human history Several important events in the history of Guadalajara occurred in the canyon. In the 19th century, during the Spanish Conquest combat between the indigenous natives of Huentit√°n and the Spaniards took place in this area. This was also the location of many battles of the Mexican Revolution and Cristero War. But perhaps the most interesting story about this canyon is that of a flooding that took place during the Porfiriato era (1876-1911). Protected area The Canyon is considered a biogeographic corridor since it is home to several types of vegetation: Tropical Forest, Deciduous, Riparian forest vegetation and secondary vegetation. Several species of flora and fauna are endemic to the canyon. It is often visited by national and international investigators since it includes great biological diversity. On June 5, 1997 the canyon was declared a Nature reserve, under the category of Zone subject to Ecological Conservation Protected Area by the World Conservation Union of all the area belonging to the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area because it is the most urbanized area. Great Horned Owls, Collared Peccaries, Bobcats, Gray Foxes, Opossums, Red-tailed Boas, Barn Owls, Leaf Cutter Ants and Vampire Bats are among the species making a home in the canyon. The Guggenheim Guadalajara was expected to be finished in early 2010, but was cancelled by the museum company. There are several urbanized areas that cover the eastern side of the canyon, complexes such as the University of Guadalajara campus of the CUAAD Center of Art, Architecture and Design, the Guadalajara Zoo, and the now closed Guadalajara Planetarium. In addition to several residential areas, there are also sporting and recreational facilities that include soccer fields, basketball, tennis and fronton courts, picnic spaces, a running strip, a recreational park and an outdoor theater. There were plans to build the next Guggenheim Museum in early 2008, the controversial Arcediano dam project and a high-rise project called Puerta Guadalajara (Guadalajara Gate) which would have included a shopping mall, a convention center, two hotels, two museums, 9 residential towers and two more corporate towers. None of these projects were started and it seems likely that they have now all been cancelled or postponed indefinitely. However, work is in progress on the construction of an art museum in the Mirador park, on the site formerly intended for the Guggenheim museum project. near to Guadalajara. near to Guadalajara. beautiful landscape near the city.

He emerged as an apologist for faith in Evangelical Christianity during the 1970s. He and his soon-to-be wife, Gretchen, had already begun to collaborate in a ministry of Christian evangelism toward adherents of the Jehovah's Witnesses when they became acquainted with the Baptist pastor and countercult writer Walter Martin.Tim Stafford, \\"The Kingdom of the Cult Watchers,\\" Christianity Today, October 7, 1991, p. 21. Martin was the founder of the apologetics ministry Christian Research Institute.Walter R. Martin, \\"Christian Research Institute,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14, number 1, October 1970, p. 16. In 1974 Martin relocated the Institute from New Jersey to southern California where he re-established his ministry in association with the Melodyland School of Theology.Richard Quebedeaux, The Worldly Evangelicals, San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1978, p. 66. Martin officiated as the minister at the marriage ceremony of the Passantinos.Stafford, \\"Kingdom of Cult Watchers\\", p. 21. The Passantinos assisted Martin in the ministry of the Christian Research Institute for approximately five years from 1974 to 1979.Charles R. Biggs,\\"Walter Martin: Patron Saint of Evangelical Apologists\\" Walter Martin, \\"Foreword\\" in Robert Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, Answers to the Cultist at Your Door, Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House Publishers, 1981, p. 3. In that context Martin privately taught them the rudiments of the discipline of apologetics and of investigative reporting in countercult ministry. During the 1970s and 1980s Gretchen served as an editorial assistant in preparing revised editions of some of Martin's books such as The Rise of the Cults,Walter R. Martin, \\"Acknowledgements\\" The Rise of the Cults, Rev. Ed., Santa Ana: Vision House, 1977, p. 5 The Kingdom of the CultsWalter R. Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Rev. Ed., Minneapolis: Bethany House, 1985, p. 7. and The Maze of Mormonism.Walter R. Martin, The Maze of Mormonism, Rev. Ed., Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, p. 7. As a couple, the Passantinos began to develop their profile as speakers in evangelical churches delivering presentations about cults and general apologetics questions concerning the existence of God and the historicity of the Bible. Together they then branched out from working at Christian Research Institute and began to operate their own apologetics and countercult ministry known as Christian Apologetics: Research and Information Service (CARIS).\\"Credits\\" in Walter R. Martin, The New Cults, Santa Ana: Vision House, 1980, p 410. This ministry subsequently was renamed as Answers In Action. They founded Answers In Action with the intent to help both Christians and non-Christians apply logic and reason to religious inquiry and to assist in answering questions about apologetics, religion, philosophy, evangelism, and theology. Robert's approach to religion was to \\"represent their belief system as accurately as you would have them represent yours.\\"The Apologetics Study Bible: Understand Why You Believe, Nashville: Holman Bible Publishers, 2007, p. 1655. Some of their initial writing appeared as researched chapters in Martin's book The New Cults.See chapter one \\"The Deception of the New Cults\\" and \\"The Local Church of Witness Lee\\" in Martin, The New Cults, pp. 11-35 and 379-408. Their first co-written book Answers to the Cultist at Your Door was designed as a popular apologetics handbook for Christians.Robert Passantino and Gretchen Passantino and Raymond Schafer, Answers to the Cultist at Your Door, Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House, 1981. The book consisted of brief chapters about the phenomenon of cults followed by specific chapters containing evangelical apologetic responses to the doctrines taught by the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Unification Church, Hare Krishna, and the Way International. Passantino contributed an essay on Jehovah's Witnesses in Ronald Enroth's book Evangelising the Cults.Ronald Enroth ed. Evangelising the Cults, Milton Keynes: Word Publishing, 1991, pp.121-138. This essay centered a basic Evangelical apologetic argument that challenged the stance taken by Jehovah's Witnesses on three doctrines: the Trinity, Christ, and Salvation. He also contributed a lengthy essay that explored the theory, techniques, and application of religious research to the Evangelical Ministries to New Religions' symposium volume Contend for the Faith that was published in 1992.\\"Religious Research: theory, techniques and Application\\" in Contend for the Faith, Eric Pement ed. Chicago: Evangelical Ministries to new Religions, 1992, pp. 26-69. During the 1990s the Passantinos emerged as critical evangelical voices on a number of questions connected to Protestant understandings about the subject of Satanism and the Occult. One of their early expos√©s, first published in Cornerstone magazine, concerned Lauren Stratford's fraudulent claims of satanic ritual abuse.Bob & Gretchen Passantino and Jon Trott, \\"Satan's Sideshow: The True Lauren Stratford Story\\", Cornerstone, 1990 Vol. 18, Issue 90 They were highly skeptical about claims concerning Satanic Ritual Abuse and they argued that the basis of these claims could be explained as a combination of folklore and moral panic.Robert & Gretchen Passantino, \\"Satanic Ritual Abuse in Popular Christian Literature: Why Christians Fall For a Lie Searching for the Truth,\\" Journal of Psychology and Theology, Volume 20, number 3, Fall 1992, pp. 299-305. In both published essays and books they called into question what they regarded as misconceptions commonly held by Christians about the beliefs and practices of Satanist groups.Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, Satanism, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1995, pp. 45-61. This included their alarm at how Satanists were often accused in Christian literature or in popular media as being perpetrators of organized crime.When the Devil Dares Your Kids: Protecting Your Children from Satanism, Witchcraft, and the Occult, Ann Arbor: Servant Publications/Guildford, Surrey: Eagle, 1991, pp.131-160. Passantino's commitment to a libertarian concept of free-agency led to critical evaluations of theological, philosophical, and socio-psychological forms of determinism. Against a wide current of Christian and non-Christian opinion, the Passantinos published a controversial article in Cornerstone magazine in 1994, titled Overcoming The Bondage Of Victimization: A Critical Evaluation of Cult Mind Control Theories , in which they criticized the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of \\"mind control\\" and \\"exit counseling\\" models. The article was reprinted in a later edition of Martin's The Kingdom of the Cults, but has since been removed due to allegations that it didn't represent Martin's own views. The Passantinos were highly influential on other apologists as evidenced by the acknowledgements made by other apologists who refer to them concerning their input and research. This was particularly so because it was new and no one had really addressed the subject prior to the 1970s.Lee Strobel, \\"Acknowledgements\\" in The Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus, Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1998, p. 4.Also see Lee Strobel, The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity, Zondervan, 2000, p. 299.Bill Hybels and Mark Mittelberg, \\"Acknowledgements\\" in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1996. Death and legacy Robert Passantino died on November 17, 2003, age 52, due to cardiac arrest. He is buried at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California. His wife, Gretchen, died from cardiac dysrhythmia as a result of undiagnosed diabetes on October 2, 2014, age 61, at Hoag Hospital Newport Beach. They are survived by their three children.

Breckinridge Memorial, originally on the courthouse lawn of Lexington, Kentucky, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky MPS. It commemorates John C. Breckinridge, who was born and died in Lexington. He was Vice President for James Buchanan and ran against Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 United States presidential election, winning nine Southern states. He served in the Confederate States Army, and was the last Confederate States Secretary of War, fleeing the country after the South lost. The memorial was prepared by New York's Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company. The pedestal is made of granite, with the statue cast in bronze. Breckinridge is seen standing contraposto.Civil War in Kentucky The state government of Kentucky funded the construction of the monument. Breckinridge's memorial was built in 1887, 24 years before the John Hunt Morgan Memorial, also on the courthouse lawn and part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky MPS. The statues had stood on Main Street on the same plot of ground where slave auctions were held before the Civil War. In 2010, the monument was moved about 50 feet to a new location facing Main Street. This was done as part of the Cheapside pavilion construction project. The old Fayette County Courthouse was renovated and reopened in 2018 to serve as a tourism, entertainment, and office hub.  Removal from original site  In November 2015, a committee, the Urban County Arts Review Board, voted to recommend removal of both the Breckinridge statue and the Morgan statue. In February 2016 Lexington mayor Jim Gray announced the statues would stay, but later advocated to remove them after receiving pressure from local grassroots organizing. The monuments were removed October 17, 2017. After a city council vote in November 2017, the city voted in favor or relocating the statues of Breckinridge and Morgan to the Lexington Cemetery. The relocation was completed in July 2018. The bases for the statues, security cameras, and moving costs were funded by private donations. Breckinridge's memorial was placed in his family's burial area in Section G. Morgan's was placed in the Confederate section of the cemetery.

Much of its space was given to fiction and the lighter forms of literature. In April 1865 she sold the review to the Jesuits, who changed the subtitle to \\"A magazine and review\\" (1865‚Äì1873).

He was a legitimized son of Ludovico il Moro, duke of Milan, and Lucrezia Crivelli. In 1513, when his half-brother Massimiliano shortly restored the family seignory in Milan, he took part in the defence of Novara against the French.

In 1532, after the peace of Bologna between Francesco II and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he received in reward the title of marquess of Caravaggio. Three years later, after Francesco's death, he moved to the Kingdom of Naples (then under Spanish suzerainty) to reclaim the Duchy of Milan for himself, but died midway at Florence under mysterious circumstances.

The campaign concluded with the fall of Wu and the reunification of China under the Jin dynasty. Background As early as 262, Sima Zhao, a regent of the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period, had already planned the first outline for the conquest of Wei's rival states, Eastern Wu and Shu Han, by eliminating Shu first, then take on Wu three years later. However, the conquest of Shu in the following year severely strained Wei's resources and Wei desperately needed time to recover. Compounding the problem, Wei lacked an adequate naval force required for the campaign on Wu. Sima Zhao therefore postponed the planned conquest of Wu and started to consolidate power in Wei first. In 265, Sima Zhao died and was succeeded by his son, Sima Yan (Emperor Wu). In the same year, Sima Yan usurped the throne from the last Wei emperor Cao Huan and established the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) with himself as the emperor. After this event, only Eastern Wu was left of the three major powers in the Three Kingdoms period. In comparison with Wei and the subsequent Jin dynasty, Eastern Wu experienced greater problems of its own: the succession from the third Wu emperor, Sun Xiu, was marred with bloodshed and internal conflict. Sun Xiu's successor, Sun Hao, was a tyrant who made little effort to prepare for the imminent invasion by the Jin dynasty. Sun Hao's rule was more harsh as compared to the later part of the reign of Sun Quan, Wu's founding emperor. This caused a continuous wave of peasant uprisings and military mutinies, which mainly took place in present- day Zhejiang and Guangdong. Not only did Sun Hao refuse to accept advice to strengthen Wu's defences and reduce the burden on its people, he also executed around four dozen high-ranking officials who provided good counsel on governance. As a result, the Wu government had already lost the popular support of the people, and many regional commanders stationed at the border defected to the Jin dynasty. Prelude To stabilise the newly conquered state of Shu, as well as showing benevolence towards the people of Wu so that they would defect or surrender to the Jin dynasty, Emperor Wu of Jin enfeoffed the former Shu emperor Liu Shan as a duke and awarded marquis titles to over 50 former Shu officials. Zhuge Liang's grandson, Zhuge Jing (Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫¨), also received important appointments in the Jin government. At the same time, Emperor Wu sent envoys to Eastern Wu to cease hostilities between the two states, in order to buy time for making preparations. Eastern Wu's emperor Sun Hao, in turn, viewed such actions as a sign of weakness of the Jin dynasty, and further let down his guard. =Jin preparations= Jin preparations for the conquest of Wu begun in 269, when three places were selected as bases to launch the attack. New assignments were given as follows: * Yang Hu was appointed as the viceroy of Jing Province and stationed at Xiangyang. * Wei Guan was appointed as the viceroy of Qing Province and stationed at Linzi (Ëá®Ëèë; northeast of present-day Zibo, Shandong). * Sima Zhou was appointed as the viceroy of Xu Province and stationed at Xiapi (‰∏ãÈÇ≥; northwest of present-day Suining County, Jiangsu). On Yang Hu's recommendation, Emperor Wu appointed Wang Jun as the viceroy of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 272, and soon after, on Du Yu's advice, Emperor Wu promoted Wang Jun to Prancing Dragon General (ÈæçÈ©§Â∞áËªç). Wang Jun was put in charge of building a strong navy for the conquest of Wu. An ambitious general who was already turning 70, Wang Jun was eager to establish fame by the conquest of Wu, and while he was still the Inspector of Yi Province, he already begun the process. The new ranks sped up the process tremendously by enabling Wang Jun to draft much more men: in comparison to the 500 to 600 workers previously available, every commandery within Yi Province must provide him with 10,000 men. As a result, the remaining work of the naval construction project was completed in a year. To make up for their lack of experience of naval warfare in comparison to Eastern Wu's navy, Wang Jun built many large ships with ram bows. The largest ship was in excess of 170 metres and could carry around 2,000 troops on board. The fortifications on these ships were three stories tall and was claimed to be the largest at the time. It took Wang Jun a total of seven years to build the navy he needed to conquer Eastern Wu and the only thing left to do was to train his soldiers and sailors. In October 276, the preparation was roughly completed and Yang Hu suggested to Emperor Wu to launch the attack. Yang Hu's suggestion was initially accepted but then delayed due to Jia Chong's objection, because the Xianbei tribes in northwestern China had started a rebellion. In July 277, additional assignments were given in order to prepare for the campaign against Eastern Wu: * Wang Hun (ÁéãÊ∏æ) was put in charge of military affairs of Yang Province * Sima Liang was put in charge of military affairs of Yu Province * Hu Fen (ËÉ°Â•Æ) was put in charge of military affairs along the northern shore of the Yangtze River After Yang Hu's death, Du Yu succeeded him and was appointed Senior General Who Conquers the South (ÂæÅÂçóÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç) to take charge of military affairs in Jing Province from November 278. =Wu preparations= In comparison to the active preparation of its adversary, the Wu emperor Sun Hao did nearly nothing to defend against an invasion. Some leftover wooden pieces from Wang Jun's naval construction project flowed downstream and were picked up by the Eastern Wu general Wu Yan (ÂêæÂΩ•). Wu Yan sent the wooden pieces to Sun Hao as evidence of the imminent attack and asked for reinforcements, but Sun Hao ignored the request as he did to similar suggestions from Lu Kang and others. After Lu Kang's death, his military command was split among his five sons as follows: * Lu Yan (Èô∏Êôè) was appointed as the commander of the land force * Lu Jing was appointed as the commander of the navy * Lu Xuan (Èô∏ÁéÑ) was appointed as the deputy commander of the land force * Lu Ji was appointed as the deputy commander of the navy * Lu Yun (Èô∏Èõ≤) was appointed as the commander of the local garrison This division of power greatly weakened Wu's defences and three of Lu Kang's sons were killed in battle during the Jin invasion. Strategic planning In 279, Wang Jun thought that it was time to launch the decisive attack on Wu. However, the majority of officials in the imperial court strongly objected to launching an invasion, except Du Yu and Zhang Hua, who strongly supported Wang Jun's idea. The two of them managed to convince Emperor Wu to agree with them, and the strategy of Jin was basically the one planned by Yang Hu when he was still alive. 200,000 troops out of the 500,000 strong regular army were deployed for the campaign, and by this time, the Jin navy was also at least on par with the Eastern Wu navy. =Jin strategy= The Jin army did not enjoy numerical superiority because it faced the entire Wu force of 230,000 and over 5,000 ships that defended the state. However, the morale of Jin was much higher than Wu. Furthermore, the Wu forces was scattered along the several thousand miles long border, and the attacking Jin armies could concentrate their forces to attack the isolated pockets of Wu resistance. Based on this principle, Jin would attack Wu along the Yangtze River in five routes to support the main attack force led by Wang Jun from Sichuan, going downstream along the Yangtze. Wang Hun (ÁéãÊ∏æ) and Sima Zhou were tasked to tie down the main force of Wu, preventing it from reinforcing the upstream Yangtze River by threatening Wu's capital, Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). Wang Rong, Du Yu and Hu Fen (ËÉ°Â•Æ) were tasked to take all strongholds of Wu located to the west of Xiakou (Â§èÂè£; present-day Wuchang District, Hubei) to coordinate with the 70,000 strong main force led by Wang Jun. After the attacking forces had joined together, they would push toward east along the Yangtze River and the capture of Jianye would be the responsibility of Wang Hun, Sima Zhou and Wang Jun. To better coordinate the attack, Emperor Wu ordered that Wang Jun would be under Du Yu's command after reaching Jianping, and after reaching Jianye, he would be under Wang Hun's command. =Wu strategy= Since the Wu emperor Sun Hao did not believe that the Jin dynasty was capable of taking Wu and the overconfidence in the Yangtze River as the natural defensive barrier, barely anything was done to prepare for the incoming campaign. However, Wu did reinforce its defences by deploying iron awls linked together by iron chains in the Three Gorges to prevent ships from passing, but Sun Hao and his followers were so overconfident about this additional measure that not a single soldier was deployed to guard the region. The campaign=Battles at the upstream of the Yangtze River= Wang Jun's navy began its downstream Yangtze River attack in December 279 after being joined by his deputy, Tang Bin (ÂîêÂΩ¨) in charge of Badong Commandery (Â∑¥Êù±ÈÉ°; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing). The combined force totalled 70,000. A month later, Du Yu begun his attack on Jiangling County from Xiangyang and sent three of his advisers ‚Äì Fan Xian (Ê®äÈ°Ø), Yin Lin (Â∞πÊûó) Deng Gui (ÈÑßÂú≠) ‚Äì along with Zhou Qi (Âë®Â•á), the Administrator of Xiangyang, westward along the Yangtze River to join Wang Jun in attacking the strongholds of Wu between them from both the east and the west. By early March 280, Wang Jun's army had taken Danyang (‰∏πÊ•ä; east of present-day Zigui County, Hubei) from Wu, and captured its defending officer, Sheng Ji (ÁõõÁ¥Ä). The Jin fleet under Wang Jun's command continued on after taking Danyang and upon reaching Xiling Gorge, they had met obstacles set up by Wu, the iron awls linked together by iron chains in water. However, Wang Jun had already captured most of Wu's agents, as well as many prisoners-of-war, and based on the information obtained from the captives, the Jin forces already had a detailed knowledge of Wu's defences, knowing exactly where the weakest spots were and where to attack. The Jin navy deployed dozens of rafts ahead of the fleet and when the iron awls struck the rafts, they were stuck. The rafts were full of dummies soaked in oil which were lit, causing the iron chains and awls to melt. After several hours, those man-made obstacles were completely cleared and the Jin fleet continued advancing. By 20 March 280, Jin forces had taken Xiling (Ë•øÈôµ; northwest of present-day Yichang, Hubei), and two days later, Jingmen and Yidao (Â§∑ÈÅì; present-day Yidu, Hubei) also fell under Jin control. All major Wu commanders, including Liu Xian (ÁïôÊÜ≤), Cheng Ju (ÊàêÊìö), Yu Zhong and Lu Yan were captured and then executed. The victorious Jin fleet continued its offensive against Lexiang (Ê®ÇÈÑâ; northeast of present-day Songzi, Hubei), defeating the local Wu forces who ventured out of the protection of city walls in an attempt to stop the Jin assault. In the meantime, Du Yu had sent his subordinate Zhou Zhi (Âë®Êó®) to cross the Yangtze River with 800 horsemen at night to plant many flags in Mount Ba (Â∑¥Â±±; southwest of present-day Songzi, Hubei), appearing to be a much larger force, while laying ambush just outside Lexiang. As the local Wu garrison went out earlier to engage Wang Jun's force retreated back to the city after their defeat, Zhou Zhi and his men were able to sneak into the city and capture it. The defending officer of Lexiang, Sun Xin (Â≠´Ê≠Ü), was captured by Zhou Zhi and sent to Du Yu. Wang Jun, in his report to the Jin imperial court, claimed that Sun Xin was killed in action. In fact, it was Wu's naval commander-in-chief, Lu Jing, who was killed when Lexiang fell to the Jin forces. Du Yu's army subsequently conquered Jiangling and killed the Wu general Wu Yan (‰ºçÂª∂). =Redeployment of Jin forces= On 4 April 280, Emperor Wu strengthened the main force under Wang Jun's command by redeploying troops under other commanders: * Du Yu to attack southward to take Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; present-day Yongzhou, Hunan), Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), and Hengyang (Ë°°ÈôΩ; west of present-day Xiangtan, Hunan), and 10,000 troops under Du Yu's command would be reassigned to Wang Jun, and another 7,000 troops under Du Yu's command would be reassigned to Wang Jun's deputy, Tang Bin (ÂîêÂΩ¨). * Hu Fen (ËÉ°Â•Æ) would take Xiakou (Â§èÂè£; present-day Hankou, Hubei) together with Wang Jun's force, and after the city was taken, 7,000 troops under Hu Fen's command would be reassigned to Wang Jun. * Wang Rong would join forces with Wang Jun to take Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), and after the city was taken, 6,000 troops under Wang Rong's command would be reassigned to Wang Jun's deputy, Tang Bin. * After taking Baqiu (Â∑¥‰∏ò; present-day Yueyang, Hunan), Wang Jun's force would join forces with other commanders to take other cities as mentioned above, and then continue on toward Jianye, the capital of Eastern Wu. Following Emperor Wu's orders, Wang Jun continued his offensive and Wu general Meng Tai (Â≠üÊ≥∞) surrendered with his forces guarding Qichun and Zhu (ÈÇæ; present day Huanggang, Hubei) counties. The next target was also captured without much fight: after Wang Rong's force led by Luo Shang and Liu Qiao (ÂäâÂñ¨) joined Wang Jun and begun their offensive, Liu Lang (ÂäâÊúó), the Administrator of Wuchang, lost his will to resist and surrendered without a fight. With the exception of Jianping, which was defended by Wu Yan (ÂêæÂΩ¶), the Administrator of Jianping, all other territories of Wu on the upper Yangtze River had fallen under the Jin dynasty's control. By this time, Jia Chong, the Jin commander- in-chief of the campaign who had opposed the campaign from the start, had found the opportunity to suggest a conclusion of the campaign. Jia Chong claimed that it was good to withdraw after the continuous victories because if the war continues, it would exhaust the resources of the state and troops remain the south would suffer from epidemics. However, the war progressed much faster and better than Jia Chong had predicted and his suggestion was ignored. =Battles midstream and downstream of the Yangtze River= At the midstream and downstream of the Yangtze River, starting in mid February 280, Wang Hun (ÁéãÊ∏æ) conquered Wu's territories of Xunyang (Â∞ãÈôΩ; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), Gaowang (È´òÊúõ; southwest of present-day Pu County Êµ¶Á∏£), and Laixiang (Ë≥¥ÈÑâ), capturing the Wu general Zhou Xing (Âë®Ëàà). Sima Zhou took Tuzhong (Ê∂Ç‰∏≠) and sent his subordinate Liu Hong (ÂäâÂºò) to solidify the newly captured territory on the northern shore of the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, Sima Zhou sent Wang Heng (ÁéãÊÅÜ) to cross the Yangtze River and continue attacking Wu. Wang Heng's army captured the Wu general Cai Ji (Ëî°Ê©ü) and killed more than 60,000 Wu troops in the battle. Surprised with the news of attack, Sun Hao ordered Zhang Ti, Zhuge Jing, Shen Ying (Ê≤àÁë©) and Sun Zhen (Â≠´Èúá) to lead a 30,000-strong army to engage the enemy. Zhang Ti decided the only chance for Wu was to immediately venture out to stop the enemy before their morale collapsed, and if the enemy's advance could be beaten back or at least checked, his force would join the Wu forces in the upstream Yangtze River to strengthen their position. In mid April 280, Zhang Ti led his force across the Yangtze River and besieged Wang Hun's subordinate Zhang Qiao (ÂºµÂñ¨). Zhang Qiao only had 7,000 troops and surrendered. Zhuge Jing suspected that the surrender was a trick and asked Zhang Ti to execute Zhang Qiao, but Zhang Ti refused, and instead, accepted Zhang Qiao's surrender. As a precaution measure, Zhang Ti did order Zhang Qiao to remain by his side so that Zhang Qiao would not have the chance to escape back to Jin. As the Wu army continued on, they encountered Jin forces led by Zhang Han (ÂºµÁø∞) and Zhou Jun (Âë®Êø¨). Shen Ying personally led 5,000 crack troops from Danyang to charge into the Jin army's formation thrice, but was beaten back with heavy losses. The defeat of the elite force seriously demoralised the rest of the Wu soldiers, and the result was a disorganised retreat. Seizing on the opportunity, the Jin generals Xue Sheng (ËñõÂãù) and Jiang Ban (Ëî£Áè≠) launched a surprise counterattack, defeating the Wu forces and killing over 5,800 enemy troops. As the surviving Wu forces fled from the battlefield, the surrendered Zhang Qiao attacked the fleeing Wu soldiers from the opposite direction at Banqiao (ÁâàÊ©ã), inflicting a further 2,000 fatalities on the already defeated Wu army. Zhang Ti, Shen Ying, and Sun Zhen were all killed in the decisive battle that shocked Wu. Only Zhuge Jing managed to escape alive back to Jianye. Wang Hun's subordinate urged him to press on to attack Jianye immediately, but he refused under the excuse that he was ordered by Emperor Wu to secure the northern shore of Yangtze River only and wait for Wang Jun. Wang Hun was in fact, taking a more cautious approaching by attempting to join forces with Wang Jun to ensure the final victory, but such prudence cost him the glory of capturing the Wu capital, the highest honour in the campaign. Wang Jun's 80,000 strong army, meanwhile, reached Niuzhu (ÁâõÊ∏ö) on 30 April 280, after leaving Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and the Wu emperor Sun Hao ordered Zhang Xiang (ÂºµË±°) to lead a 10,000 strong navy to engage the enemy. However, when both fleets met, the demoralised Wu navy surrendered en masse, including Zhang Xiang himself. Wang Hun ordered Wang Jun to see him so that they could discuss their next move, but Wang Jun answered that his fleet had already passed Wang Hun's camp and could not turn back due to the current, and continued on toward Jianye. As Wang Jun's forces advanced on to Sanshan (‰∏âÂ±±) on 30 April 280, just southeast of Jianye, the Wu general Tao Jun (Èô∂Êø¨) organised a 20,000 strong army to make a last stand, but nearly all the Wu troops deserted on the very same night, and Tao Jun and his few remaining followers were killed subsequently in their futile struggle against the Jin invaders. Sun Hao adopted a last attempt suggested by his subjects Xue Ying and Hu Chong (ËÉ°Ê≤ñ) by sending letters of surrender to Sima Zhou, Wang Jun and Wang Hun, in a move to stir up internal conflict among the Jin commanders in order to buy time, but such a tactic proved useless. On 1 May 280, Sun Hao stripped all clothing on his upper body and tied himself up (a traditional way of presenting prisoners-of-war to the victors) and walked to Wang Jun's camp to surrender. Prior to that, Sun Hao issued his last imperial decree, asking his people not to be upset with the end of Wu, but prepare themselves to serve the Jin dynasty. Sun Hao was then taken to the Jin capital Luoyang with his imperial chariot, but was not allowed to ride on it. Instead, he travelled on foot as he was now a prisoner- of-war. After hearing of Sun Hao's surrender, the last pocket of Wu resistance in Jianping, led by Wu Yan (ÂêæÂΩ•), followed suit even after having successfully defended against all Jin attacks throughout the campaign. Aftermath The fall of Jianye marked the end of Wu and the Three Kingdoms period, and China was unified again under the Jin dynasty. The Jin commanders who participated in the campaign were handsomely rewarded, and ironically, Jia Chong, the overall commander who had opposed the campaign received the largest reward, the tax income of 8,000 households. Wang Hun was furious upon learning the news of Wang Jun taking Jianye, and angrily proclaimed to his subordinates that he had watched Sun Hao for nearly a hundred days, but Wang Jun took the advantage at last. Wang Hun wrote to the imperial court to complain, claiming that Wang Jun disobeyed orders and embezzled the spoils of war. Wang Jun also wrote to the imperial court to defend himself, claiming that what Wang Hun had said was slander. However, Wang Hun was much more powerful and influential in the Jin court, thus had gained an upper hand, with his followers suggesting that Wang Jun be jailed. In the end, Emperor Wu put an end to the conflict by rewarding Wang Jun handsomely. Order of battle To boost morale, some of the Jin commanders received new ranks, while in contrast, Wu did almost nothing to reinforce its own defense. =Jin forces= *Grand Chief Controller (Â§ßÈÉΩÁù£) Jia Chong **Champion General (ÂÜ†ËªçÂ∞áËªç) Yang Ji (Ê•äÊøü), served as Jia Chong's deputy **Secretary of Fiscal Revenue (Â∫¶ÊîØÂ∞öÊõ∏) Zhang Hua was in charge of supplies and logistics ***General Who Guards the Army (ÈéÆËªçÂ∞áËªç) Sima Zhou would attack Tuzhong (Ê∂Ç‰∏≠) from Xiapi (‰∏ãÈÇ≥) ****Chancellor of Langya (ÁëØÁêäÁõ∏) Liu Hong (ÂäâÂºò) ****Chief Clerk (Èï∑Âè≤) Wang Heng (ÁéãÊÅÜ) ***General Who Stabilises the East (ÂÆâÊù±Â∞áËªç) Wang Hun (ÁéãÊ∏æ), would attack Hezhou (ÂíåÂ∑û) from Yang Province ****General Who Protects the Army (Ë≠∑ËªçÂ∞áËªç) Zhang Han (ÂºµÁø∞) ****Inspector of Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤) Zhou Jun (Âë®Êø¨) ****Xue Sheng (ËñõÂãù) ****Jiang Ban (Ëî£Áè≠) ***Senior General Who Attacks the South (ÂæÅÂçóÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç) Du Yu would attack Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ) from Xiangyang ****Army Adviser (ÂèÉËªç) Fan Xian (Ê®äÈ°Ø) ****Army Adviser Yin Lin (Â∞πÊûó) ****Army Adviser Deng Gui (ÈÑßÂú≠) ****Administrator of Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩÂ§™ÂÆà) Zhou Qi (Âë®Â•á) ****General of the Standard (ÁâôÈñÄÂ∞áËªç) Zhou Zhi (Âë®Êó®) ***General Who Establishes Martial Might (Âª∫Â®ÅÂ∞áËªç) Wang Rong would attack Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) from Yu Province ****Army Adviser (ÂèÉËªç) Luo Shang (ÁæÖÂ∞ö) ****Army Adviser Liu Qiao (ÂäâÂñ¨) ****Commandant of Chengyang (ÊàêÈôΩÈÉΩÂ∞â) Zhang Qiao (ÂºµÂñ¨) ***General Who Pacifies the South (Âπ≥ÂçóÂ∞áËªç) Hu Fen (ËÉ°Â•Æ) would attack Xiakou (Â§èÂè£; present-day Wuchang District, Hubei) from Jing Province ***Prancing Dragon General (ÈæçÈ©§Â∞áËªç) Wang Jun would attack downstream from Sichuan along the Yangtze River ****General Who Spreads Martial Might (Âª£Ê≠¶Â∞áËªç) Tang Bin (ÂîêÂΩ¨), defended Badong (Â∑¥Êù±; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) =Wu forces=Before 17 April 280 * Grand Chief Controller (Â§ßÈÉΩÁù£) Lu Yan (Èô∏Êôè) **Lu Xuan (Èô∏ÁéÑ), served as Lu Yan's deputy *** General of Martial Might (Ê≠¶Â®ÅÂ∞áËªç) Zhou Xing (Âë®Ëàà) *** Cai Ji (Ëî°Ê©ü) *** Supervisor of Danyang (‰∏πÊ•äÁõ£) Sheng Ji (ÁõõÁ¥Ä) *** General Who Guards the South (ÈéÆÂçóÂ∞áËªç) Liu Xian (ÁïôÊÜ≤) *** General Who Attacks the South (ÂæÅÂçóÂ∞áËªç) Cheng Ju (ÊàêÊìö) *** Administrator of Yidu (ÂÆúÈÉΩÂ§™ÂÆà) Yu Zhong (ËôûÂø†) ***Commander of Lexiang (Ê®ÇÈÑâÁù£) Sun Xin (Â≠´Ê≠Ü) *** Commander of Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµÁù£) Wu Yan (‰ºçÂª∂) *** General of the Standard (ÁâôÈñÄÂ∞áËªç) Meng Tai (Â≠üÊ≥∞) *** Administrator of Wuchang (Ê≠¶ÊòåÂ§™ÂÆà) Liu Lang (ÂäâÊúó) * Lu Jing served as commander of the naval force ** Lu Ji served as deputy commander of the naval force After 17 April 280 * Imperial Chancellor (‰∏ûÁõ∏) Zhang Ti **Deputy Military Adviser (ÂâØËªçÂ∏´) Zhuge Jing ** Administrator of Danyang (‰∏πÈôΩÂ§™ÂÆà) Shen Ying (Ê≤àÁë©) ** General Who Protects the Army (Ë≠∑ËªçÂ∞áËªç) Sun Zhen (Â≠´Èúá) * Guerrilla General (Ê∏∏ÊìäÂ∞áËªç) Zhang Xiang (ÂºµË±°) * Commander of Xuling (ÂæêÈôµÁù£) Tao Jun (Èô∂Êø¨) * Administrator of Jianping (Âª∫Âπ≥Â§™ÂÆà) Wu Yan (ÂêæÂΩ•) In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the task of building a navy for the Jin dynasty was credited to Zhong Hui before the fall of Shu, when Zhong Hui recommended to Sima Zhao that constructing a large navy to attack Wu was a diversion to trick Shu into letting down its guard, and when it was time to truly attack Wu after the conquest of Shu, the navy would be ready. In reality, however, the idea of constructing a large navy originated from Wang Jun and Emperor Wu, and the plan was set into motion only after the fall of Shu. In the novel, the last event before the campaign ended was described to be Zhang Xiang's surrender when he led a 10,000 strong navy to engage Jin forces. Since the Wu imperial court had not received news of Zhang Xiang's surrender yet, Wang Jun ordered Zhang Xiang to return to the Wu capital Jianye to trick the Wu defenders into opening the city gates. Zhang Xiang followed as instructed and Jin forces swiftly conquered Jianye. The Wu emperor Sun Hao surrendered and that marked the end of Wu. In history, however, before Sun Hao's surrender, there was one last battle at Sanshan (‰∏âÂ±±), just southeast of Jianye, between Wang Jun's army and a smaller force led by Wu general Tao Jun (Èô∂Êø¨).

The Boys and Girls Club of America operates many of the centers on behalf of the National Football League, but the legacy gift can be awarded to any organization completing a bid and applying for the gift. Like the Boys and Girls Clubs, YET Centers provide afterschool activities for school-age children. These activities include sports programs, computer training, career development, and tutoring. Each YET is located in a lower-income neighborhood of a city that has hosted a Super Bowl since the early 1990s. History Logo with the old NFL logo.The YET concept grew out of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the need that arose to correct the social inequities laid bare by that event. The NFL announced that it would build and finance a new after school center in Compton, California as a legacy of Super Bowl XXVII (held in the L.A. area at the Rose Bowl Stadium). Michael Jackson and Garth Brooks also helped finance the opening of the Compton center. After the success of the Compton YET, the NFL announced that a new center would open in conjunction with each new Super Bowl. , there were 12 centers in 10 locations (San Diego and Tampa have two each, as those cities have hosted multiple Super Bowls in this period), and three others were under construction. The NFL has considered a Youth Education Town in Honolulu, Hawaii in honor of the Pro Bowl. In 2011, The Salvation Army was awarded the legacy gift in honor of Super Bowl XLV and, after two years of planning and renovations, opened the North Texas Youth Education Town in Arlington, Texas in Fall 2013. In 2012, Indianapolis, IN received the gift and created the Chase Near Eastside Legacy Center which became a combination YET hosting youth activities as well as a full health fitness facility.

First Edition (Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), 71., brusselair or brusseleir) is a near-extinct dialect spoken in Brussels. Essentially it is a heavily Frenchified Brabant-Dutch dialect additionally incorporating a sprinkle of Spanish dating back to the rule of the Low Countries by the Habsburgs (1519-1713). Its name refers to a district of Brussels called Marollen (Marolles), a neighborhood in the south-central municipality of Brussels, not far from the Palace of Justice. The district takes its name from the former abbey of the nuns Maria Colenteshttp://latindictionary.wikidot.com/search:site/q/colere worshipping Mary (Marikollen). It was a working-class neighborhood, though now it has become a fashionable part of the city. Marols is described as \\"totally indecipherable to the foreigner (which covers everyone not born in the Marolles) which is probably a good thing as it is richly abusive.\\" The Th√©√¢tre Royal de Toone in Brussels puts on puppet and plays in Marols. What is Marols? L√©on van Dievoet. There is a dispute and confusion about the meaning of Marols, which many consider to be a neighborhood jargon distinct from a larger Brussels Dutch dialect, while others use the term \\"Marols\\" as an overarching substitute term for that citywide dialect.Jeanine Treffers-Daller, Mixing Two Languages: French-Dutch Contact in a Comparative Perspective (Walter de Gruyter, 1994), 25. According to Jeanine Treffers-Daller, ‚Äúthe dialect has a tremendous prestige and a lot of myths are doing the rounds.‚Äù Origins A local version of the Brabantian dialect was originally spoken in Brussels. When the Kingdom of Belgium was established in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, French was established as the only official language of the kingdom. French was therefore primarily used amongst nobility (however some in the historic towns of Flanders were bilingual and stayed attached to the old Flemish national literature), the middle class and a significant portion of the population whose secondary education had only been delivered in French. French then gradually spread through the working classes, especially after the establishment of compulsory education in Belgium from 1914 for children aged between six and fourteen years. Primary school education was given in Dutch in the Flemish regions and in French in the Walloon regions. Secondary education was only given in French throughout Belgium. Drained by the personal needs of the administration, many new working class arrivals from the south of Belgium, again increased the presence of French in Brussels. Today, French is the primary language used in Brussels. Informal language was from then on a mixture of Romance and Germanic influences, which adapted into becoming Marols. Examples An example of Marols is: Marols and The Adventures of Tintin The coat-of-arms of Syldavia features a motto in Syldavian, which is based on Marols. It reads Eih bennek, eih blavek, in English: (\\"Here I am, here I stay\\"). For the popular comic series The Adventures of Tintin, the Belgian author Herg√© modeled his fictional languages SyldavianHerg√©'s Syldavian and Bordurian on Marols, and modeled many other personal and place-names in his works on the dialect (e.g. the city of Khemkh√¢h in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Khemed comes from the Marols phrase for \\"I'm cold\\"). Bordurian, for example, has as one of its words the Marols-based \\"m√§nhir\\", meaning \\"mister\\" (cf. Dutch \\"mijnheer\\"). In the original French, the fictional Arumbaya language of San Theodoros is another incarnation of Marols.

She served during the Second World War in Home waters and off the Norwegian coast, before becoming an early war loss when she sank after hitting a mine off the Isle of Wight on 17 December 1940. The wrecksite is designated under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Construction and commissioning Acheron was ordered on 29 May 1928 from the yards of John I. Thornycroft & Company, Woolston, Hampshire under the 1927 Naval Estimates. She was laid down on 29 October 1928 and was launched a year later on 18 March 1930. She was commissioned on 13 October 1931. She suffered from a number of mechanical problems which became evident in the first year of her service and would go on to plague her for the whole of her service, despite a succession of modifications and refits. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, she was under repair at Portsmouth and was not able to take up her war station until December 1939. Wartime career On completion of repairs and refit, she joined the 16th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 23 March 1940. The flotilla was then deployed in the North Western Approaches and the North Sea. After the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, Acheron was deployed with the flotilla on convoy defence and fleet screening duties in support of the military landings in Norway. On 17 April, she and were part of the escort for the cruisers , , and . The cruisers then landed troops at √Öndalsnes and Molde. On arrival on at √Öndalsnes on 18 April, Acheron was detached and deployed on patrol and escort duties. She then escorted the aircraft carrier from Scapa Flow, before deploying with the destroyers and off Namsos. On 31 May, Acheron, , , and escorted the carriers Glorious and to Norway to cover the final evacuation of British troops from Norway (Operation Alphabet). This was completed by 9 June, whereupon Acheron resumed her normal duties with the flotilla. She then operated in the English Channel to escort convoys and was in dock at Portsmouth on 21 June to have a High Angle gun fitted to improve her anti-aircraft defence. Whilst sailing south off St. Catherine's Point on 20 July, she was attacked by German dive bombers, and was damaged by nine near misses. She began repairs at Portsmouth Dockyard on 6 August, but on 24 August she was seriously damaged during an air raid which killed two of her crew and injured another three. One bomb hit her aft section and exploded, causing severe damage to her machinery, \\"Y\\" gun and superstructure. This caused her repairs to be extended until October, with her \\"Y\\" gun being replaced by a mounting from the destroyer , which had been damaged in June. In November, Acheron was nominated for service as gunnery training destroyer. Sinking Repairs were fully completed by 2 December, and she began post-refit trials. On 17 December, she was sailing off the Isle of Wight. The trial was being conducted at night, in heavy seas and with a strong north-east wind in complete darkness. She was conducting steaming exercises over a measured mile, west-south-west of St. Catherine's Point. On one of the passes, she struck a mine. The explosion caused major structural damage forward, and her own speed drove her under. She sank within four minutes, taking 196 crewmen and yard workers, who were on board for the trials, to the bottom. There were only 19 survivors. The mine was probably one of those laid by the Luftwaffe in no definite pattern along the Channel coast. Her sinking was not made public until 27 December 1940. The wrecksite was designated as a Protected Place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 in 2006.

He was born in Trino, Piedmont, the son of Theodore II of Montferrat, with whom he collaborated in the government of the marquisate from 1404. His mother was Johanna of Bar, daughter of Robert of Bar and Marie of France, Duchess of Bar. In 1412 he married Joanna of Savoy, sister of Duke Amadeus VIII, who gave him numerous children. After his father's death in 1418, John Jacob received the investiture as Marquis by emperor Sigismund. He distinguished himself for some brilliant military campaign in the Apennines area; he also increased his prestige through the marriage between his sister Sofia and the second last Byzantine Emperor, John VIII Palaiologos. John Jacob's expansion, however, spurred the reaction of the Dukes of Savoy and of Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan. In 1431 they signed an alliance aiming at the cancellation of the Montferrat state. John Jacob was therefore compelled to ask support to France. In 1432 he was defeated anyway and sued for peace, ceding several territories to Savoy but retaining the seigniory over Montferrat, although with the status of Savoy vassal. However, when Amadeus VIII asked him the payment of the war expenses, John Jacob rebelled; but, after having besieged in Chivasso, he was forced to cease. His state and his prestige were shattered, and he had again to declare himself vassal of Savoy. John Jacob died at Casale Monferrato in 1445, being succeeded by his son John IV.  Marriage and children  John Jacob married on April 26, 1411 with Joanna of Savoy (1395‚Äì1460), daughter of Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy.

He fought as condottiere for the Republic of Venice in the war that ensued after the heirless death of Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan (see Wars in Lombardy). During his reign the Palaeologus family lost the throne of Constantinople, captured by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. He set his mind rather belatedly to ensuring future of the dynasty, marrying Margherita of Savoy, daughter of Louis of Savoy and Anne of Cyprus, in Casale in December 1458. She brought a dowry of 100,000 scudi, receiving Trino, Morano, Borgo San Martino and Mombaruzzo in return. However they only had one daughter: * Elena Margherita (1459 ‚Äì 1496), who married Victor, Duke of M√ºnsterberg. He also had two illegitimate children : * Sara (1462‚Äì1503) and Scipione (1463‚Äì1485). John IV died, without legitimate heirs, in Casale on 19 January 1464; he was buried there alongside his father in the church of San Francesco. He was succeeded by his brother William VIII.

The show is a spin off to the highly successful Roger and the Rottentrolls. Plot The show focuses Ripley and Scuff along with their sister Strid and their pet barguest Bargie visiting schools across the United Kingdom and wreaking havoc. Characters *Ripley ‚Äì the leader of the gang but isn't very clever. Ripley is also the son of Sigsworthy Crags from Roger & The Rottentrolls. *Scuff ‚Äì the least intelligent one and usually gets things wrong. Scuff is also the son of Sigsworthy Crags from Roger & The Rottentrolls. *Strid ‚Äì their sister who is the most clever and often calls Ripley and scuff \\"Silly Spoons!\\".

Trivia *When CITV promoted the first series, the 'Sneaky Peek' feature had the theme from its predecessor Roger & The Rottentrolls playing instead of the tune for Ripley & Scuff. *Ripley, Scuff and Strid made an appearance in the CITV studio on the launch day of the first series, on 7 January 2002. *The second series was frequently repeated on CITV between 2006 and 2010. *Strid being the sister of Ripley & Scuff contradicts the events of the predecessor series: Roger & The Rottentrolls as Sigsworthy Crags had a wife (Ripley & Scuff's biological mother) who is a completely different character to Strid's biological mother, Kettlewell (who, as far as we know; never married Sigsworthy).

It has been alleged that Rodenstock was the perpetrator of an elaborate wine fraud. In 1992, a German court found that Rodenstock had \\"knowingly offered adulterated wine\\" for sale. On appeal, the case was settled out of court. Rare wine tastings From 1980, Rodenstock arranged annual high-profile wine tastings of old and rare wines from his collections to which he invited friends and other prominent people. The tastings would be weekend tastings held at gourmet restaurants, hotels, and resorts, and they featured huge quantities of wine at Rodenstock's expense. The participants included German celebrities and later, expanded to include some of the most prominent international wine critics. The most famous Rodenstock tasting was held from 30 August to 5 September 1998 at Hotel K√∂nigshof in Munich, when a tasting of 125 vintages of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem, the oldest of which were of the 1784 vintage, was held. Two eighteenth- century, forty nineteenth-century, and all released twentieth-century vintages of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem up to 1991 were featured in this vertical tasting, which was conducted over the course of a week. The events of the week included five luncheons, seven dinners, and more than 175 other wines. It is most likely the most extensive Yquem tasting to that date and it has been the subject of a book.August F. Winkler, \\"Yquem. Die Jahrhundert-Verkostung\\" (1999), Verlag Holzhausen, The exclusive nature of the wine selection featured at Rodenstock's tastings is indicated by the fact that Michael Broadbent, who was considered to be the world's leading authority on old wines,Michael Broadbent: \\"Michael Broadbent's Vintage Wine: 50 Years of Tasting the World's Finest Wines\\" (2003), London: Little, Brown, had tasted many of the rarest and oldest wines at Rodenstock's tastings, in particular, most eighteenth-century wines he has tasted.Keefe, Patrick Radden, The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker, September 3, 2007, p. 7 Other participants at the Rodenstock tastings included Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr., and the then-owner of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem, Alexandre de Lur-Saluces. Sales at wine auctions founders and later president of the USA (here in a 1791 portrait) served as the young republic's minister to France 1785-1789, where he made several trips to Bordeaux and other regions, and later, arranged to have French and other European wine sent to him in the U.S. Rodenstock had not just served wines at his annual tasting, but also bought and sold at wine auctions. In 1985, he came into possession of his most famous bottles, which later, have become the subject of considerable controversy as to their authenticity and provenance. According to Rodenstock's own account, in early 1985 he received a telephone call about a discovery of old wine bottles in Paris. The bottles had been found in a walled-up old cellar, and were engraved with vintage years from the late eighteenth century. This had in itself been an interesting find for a collector of old wines, but the bottles also were engraved with the initials \\"Th. J.\\", which was taken as an indication that they had belonged to Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was an active ≈ìnophile and wine collector, who spent much time in France during the 1780s and whose interest in wine is well documented.J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, p 375-376, Oxford University Press 2006, Later the same year, on 5 December 1985, Rodenstock put one of the \\"Th. J.\\" bottles up for auction at Christie's in London: a bottle of 1787 Ch√¢teau Lafite, engraved \\"1787 Lafitte Th. J.\\". The auction catalogue simply listed the value as \\"inestimable\\", and it was sold for 105,000 pound sterling, which as of 2007 remained the worldwide auction record for a single bottle of wine.Keefe, Patrick Radden, The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker, September 3, 2007, p. 1 The buyer was Christopher Forbes, bidding against Marvin Shanken of Wine Spectator Magazine, with Michael Broadbent handling the gavel at the auction. Additional \\"Th. J.\\" bottles were sold, via other auction houses. P√©trus imperial bottle controversy In late 1990s, David Peppercorn and his wife, Serena Sutcliffe, created controversy when they questioned the authenticity of Imperial (6 liter) bottles of Ch√¢teau P√©trus from the 1921, 1924, 1926, 1928, and 1934 vintages that were served at collectors' wine tasting events in 1989 and 1990. The tastings were conducted from the personal collection of Rodenstock, who claimed to have purchased them from a private collector in England. While Peppercorn and Sutcliffe's concerns were never proven, and were disputed by Rodenstock, the current manager of Ch√¢teau P√©trus, Christian Moueix, confirmed that the estate has no records of producing Imperials during those vintages.J. Suckling \\"A Taste of Deception \\" Wine Spectator, May 31st 1998 Subsequently, the authenticity of some magnums (1.5-liter bottles) of 1921 P√©trus that Rodenstock sold, also have been the subject of litigation. The 1921 is notable as having been awarded a perfect 100-point score by Robert Parker, based on his tasting at the 1995 Munich event.  Thomas Jefferson bottles In 2005, U.S. art and wine collector Bill Koch, who had bought some of the bottles attributed to Thomas Jefferson, prepared to exhibit items from his collection at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, including the Jefferson bottles. The museum asked for provenance of the items to be displayed. In 1988, Koch had bought four bottles of Ch√¢teau Lafite and Branne-Mouton (present-day Ch√¢teau Mouton- Rothschild) of the 1784 and 1787 vintages, at a U.S. wine auction house (Chicago Wine Company) and a UK rare wine dealer (Farr Vintners), and paid a total of about 500,000 U.S. dollars for them. When Koch's staff couldn't find anything except Michael Broadbent's authentification of the bottles to confirm their provenance, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia was contacted. The foundation's curator replied that based on Jefferson's records, the foundation didn't think that the bottles had been in the possession of Thomas Jefferson. Inquiries at Chicago Wine Company and Farr Vintners came up with the result that all four of Koch's bottles originated with Rodenstock. After initial attempts at contacts with Rodenstock gave no significant results, Koch hired a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent to form a team to start private investigations into Rodenstock's sales of wine. David Molyneux-Berry, former head of Sotheby's wine department was hired as a consultant, and several forensic investigations were conducted on the wines, bottles, and engravings;Keefe, Patrick Radden, The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker, September 3, 2007, p. 4Keefe, Patrick Radden, The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker, September 3, 2007, p. 6 Koch alleges that the engravings were made with an electric power tool, which would not have been possible in the eighteenth century and would indicate modern forgery. On 31 August 2006 Koch filed a civil lawsuit against Rodenstock (a.k.a. G√∂rke) in a New York federal court, claiming that he had been the victim of fraud. The reason that Rodenstock personally was named as defendant, rather than Chicago Wine Company or Farr Vintners, was that Koch claimed that Rodenstock had orchestrated an ongoing scheme to defraud wine collectors. Koch's lawsuit included many results from his team's forensic investigations. This lawsuit was then the subject of many legal turns during 2007 and 2008, primarily focused on procedural and statutory issues. A default judgment was entered against Rodenstock in May 2010.In Billionaire's Legal Crusade Against Counterfeit Wine, Money Is The Least Of It Forbes. 8 April 2013. Jacobs, Deborah. Rodenstock refused to participate in the trial. =Details of legal turns during 2007 and 2008= Rodenstock maintained that as a German citizen living in Germany, the court had no jurisdiction over him, especially since the bottles were bought from third parties, and, that the statute of limitation should bar the case. Thus, he refused to take part in the proceedings. Therefore, on 14 August 2007 the magistrate judge supervising the pretrial procedures recommended that the court should enter a default judgment against Rodenstock, provided that the case was not thrown out by the trial judge because of Rodenstock's procedural defences.Keefe, Patrick Radden, The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker, September 3, 2007, p. 9 On 11 January 2008 the case was thrown out of court by the judge because the court was lacking personal jurisdiction over Rodenstock as defendant. Koch was given 30 days to refile his lawsuit if he was dissatisfied with the court's ruling. He did so on 11 February 2008. The refiled lawsuit attempted to address the issue of the court's jurisdiction over Rodenstock. When the case was refiled, it was not known when the court would next respond to it. When Rodenstock still refused to take part in the proceedings after the lawsuit was refiled, Koch argued on 27 March 2008 that Rodenstock should be found in default. At the same time, Koch filed a lawsuit in Chicago against the Chicago Wine Company and the Chicago-based Julienne Importing Company. Sometime later, Koch claimed to have obtained evidence that nine additional bottles in his possession, dated from 1737 to 1936, also were fakes or \\"highly suspect\\" and they had originated with Rodenstock. Therefore, in June 2008, Koch asked the court's permission to file a second, amended complaint. =Rodenstock's position= To media covering the trial, Rodenstock presented various arguments to support the authenticity of the \\"Th. J.\\" bottles, and counter-arguments to Koch's claim. He never revealed the name of the person who sold the bottles to him, the address in Paris where the bottles were purportedly found, nor the exact number of bottles found. Figures ranging from \\"a dozen or so\\" to thirty have been quoted throughout the years. The German magazine Stern, which ran a story on the Jefferson bottle controversy in March 2007, has offered Rodenstock to have bottles still in his possession analysed by the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (which determined the Hitler Diaries to be faked) at their expense, but Rodenstock has declined.Stern.de: Entkorkt! Der gro√üe Weinschwindel, p. 3 =Book on the controversy= In May 2008, a book about the controversy was published under the title The Billionaire's Vinegar, written by Benjamin Wallace. In the book a tritium test and two carbon-14 tests date the wine circa 1962. Later, a cesium-137 test gave similar results. Rodenstock was not available for comments on the publication of the book. Auctioneer Michael Broadbent, on the other hand, was unhappy with how his relationship to Rodenstock was portrayed in the book. In July 2009 it was announced that Michael Broadbent would sue Random House, the publishers of The Billionaire's Vinegar, for libel and defamation of character, on claims that the book made allegations that suggested that Broadbent had behaved in an unprofessional manner in the way in which he had auctioned some of these bottles and that his relationship and dealings with Hardy Rodenstock was suspected of being improper. The suit was filed in the United Kingdom, whose libel laws are favorable to the plaintiff. Unlike U.S. law, in English defamation law even true allegations can be defamatory. Random House initially stated it did not believe it had defamed Broadbent and would defend the lawsuit. In October 2009, Random House, avoiding trial, entered into a settlement agreement with Broadbent. In a statement read out in open court, Random House apologised unreservedly for making the allegations, and accepted that they were untrue. It gave an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and paid Broadbent undisclosed damages. It removed the book from sale in the United Kingdom. It also was reported that Wallace was not a party to the lawsuit or settlement, that Random House would be making no changes to the book, and that it would continue to publish the book in all territories except the UK. The film rights to The Billionaire's Vinegar have been purchased by a Hollywood consortium, while HBO simultaneously had bought the film rights to the corresponding The New Yorker article. Royal Wine Merchants In a March 2010 lawsuit filed against Christie's, Koch alleges, inter alia, that Rodenstock distributed many bottles in the United States via Daniel Oliveros and Jeff Sokolin of Royal Wine Merchants Christie's sidebar to ‚Äì 818 bottles between 1998 and 2008, virtually all rarities, of which 87% were magnum size (1.5 L). Such a volume of rare wines in a rare format has provoked skepticism, and Oliveros and Sokolin have been accused by various sources, including Robert Parker, of selling fake wine, which they deny; some of the wines in question are documented as having originated with Rodenstock, though Royal and Rodenstock disagree on specifics. In May 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the claims against Christie's were time-barred and affirmed the dismissal of the case.

It is named in honor of the brothers Edwin and Robert Grabhorn, who established the Grabhorn Press in San Francisco in 1920. The press was \\"one of the foremost producers of finely printed books in twentieth-century America.\\" The Grabhorn Press Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco, California. The Grabhorn Institute was founded when Andrew Hoyem, the proprietor of the Arion Press (the successor to the Grabhorn Press), and the type foundry M & H Type, facing eviction from their location in San Francisco in 2000, confronted the logistical and financial problem of moving over 140 tons of metal type plus heavy iron and steel printing presses and typecasting and bookbinding equipment to a suitable new facility. The press and foundry comprised a complete, traditional bookmaking facility, including the last large-scale hot metal type foundry in the country. Support raised by the Grabhorn Institute enabled Arion and M & H to relocate to the Presidio of San Francisco as a cultural tenant in April 2001. In recognition of its work to preserve the typecasting and letterpress printing operation, the Grabhorn Institute was designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as part of \\"the nation's irreplaceable historical and cultural legacy\\" under its Save America's Treasures program. Activities of the Grabhorn Institute include exhibits and lectures related to fine printing and book arts and an apprenticeship program to preserve the crafts of typecasting, letterpress printing, and bookbinding. It also conducts tours of the historic production facility, which includes the M & H Type foundry, established in 1915 with Monotype typecasting machines that came to San Francisco for the Panama- Pacific International Exposition; twelve letterpress printing presses; a bindery for hand bookbinding; and a large collection of rare typefaces passed down from the Grabhorn brothers and the noted San Francisco printer John Henry Nash. According to Preservation, the magazine of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, \\"The collaboration among Arion Press, M & H Type, and the Grabhorn Institute is a model for preserving historic manufacturing equipment, keeping alive disappearing crafts, and printing beautiful artifacts‚Äîall in one enterprise.\\"Sawin, M. \\"Moveable Type\\".

Two works of his have survived. Life A contemporary of Simplicius of Cilicia, Priscian was born in Lydia, probably in the late 5th century. He was one of the last Neoplatonists to study at the Academy when Damascius was at its head. When Justinian I closed the school in 529, Priscian, together with Damascius, Simplicius, and four other colleagues were forced to seek asylum in the court of the Persian king Chosroes.George Sarton, (1927), Introduction to the History of Science, Volume 1, page 423. Williams & Wilkins By 533 they were allowed back into the Byzantine Empire after Justinian and Chosroes concluded a peace treaty, in which it was provided that the philosophers would be allowed to return. Works Two works of Priscian's have survived: *An epitome of Theophrastus' On Sense-Perception *Answers to Chosroes (Solutiones ad Chosroen) The Answers to Chosroes contain a series of answers to philosophical questions which were apparently posed to Priscian in a debate at the Persian court during his exile. The text exists only in a late, corrupt Latin translation. Priscian mentions: Plato's Timaeus, Phaedo and Phaedrus; Aristotle's Politics, Physics, On the Heavens, Generation and Corruption, On Dreams and On Prophesying by Dreams; Hippocrates, Strabo's Geography, Ptolemy's Almagest, Iamblichus' On the Soul and the works of Plotinus and Proclus. The list is a catalog of Neoplatonic works on cosmology and natural history. It has also been suggested that the commentary on Aristotle's On the Soul attributed to Simplicius, was written by Priscian,Steel C., in Priscian, On Theophrastus on Sense-Perception and Simplicius' On Aristotle's On the Soul 2.5-12., Cornell University Press, 1997.

Randall Amplifiers is a manufacturer of guitar amplifiers. It is a subsidiary of U.S. Music Corporation. Randall makes both solid-state and tube amplifiers. History After graduating from community college in Santa Ana, California, Don Randall worked as a salesman for a radio supply shop, where he met Leo Fender, who was operating a nearby radio repair shop. Randall went on to serve in the Army Corps of Engineers, the Signal Corps, and Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, he took a job as general manager of Radio & Television Equipment, a wholesale distributor of electronic components, and discovered that Fender had begun making a few lap steel guitars and small amplifiers. In 1946, Randall suggested that Radio & Television Equipment distribute Fender's guitars and amplifiers. Finding commercial success, the Fender Sales Corporation and Fender Electric Instrument Company were established in February 1953, with Randall in charge of sales and distribution. Randall subsequently became vice president and general manager of the Fender Musical Instrument and Fender Sales divisions of CBS. In 1969, Randall left to found the Randall Amplifier Company in Irvine, California. Randall sold the company in 1987. In the mid-1990s, it was purchased by U.S. Music Corporation.  MTS Series  In the early 2000s, the company worked with Bruce Egnater of Egnater Amplification to create the MTS (Modular Tube System) series of guitar amplifiers. These involve a single amp head consisting of the power amp and part of a preamp, and slots in the head (one for the RM20 head and combo, two for the RM50 head and combo and RM22 head, and 3 for the RM100 head and RM100C combo, and 12 for the RM1250H) in which you can insert their various preamp modules. These modules are tube preamps in themselves that model various amps, from Vox and Fender style cleans, to Marshall crunch, to all out Mesa Boogie style distortion. This series also has a rack-mount preamp unit called the RM4 that can hold up to four preamp modules at once. George Lynch, Kirk Hammett, and Scott Ian have their own signature modules and RM100 heads. The heads both have unique cosmetic differences, and some tonal difference. The only tonal difference in the three modular heads is that George Lynch's Lynch Box RM100LB comes loaded with JJ E34L power tubes, Scott Ian's RM100SI comes loaded with JJ EL34 power tubes, and Kirk Hammet's RM100KH has added depth in the power section for more bottom end than the standard RM100 head. It was hinted and confirmed during Winter NAMM 2012 that the MTS line of amplifiers would be discontinued and that Egnater would take over the line. In April 2012, Randall confirmed that the MTS amplifiers were discontinued and would be replaced by a new, high-end line of amplifiers.  Partnership with Fortin Amps (2011 - 2015)  Mike Fortin In December 2011, it was announced by the head of Fortin Amplification, Inc. that they would be teaming up with Randall amplifiers to design a new tube amp line based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Endorsee Kirk Hammett currently has four of the prototypes, one which he used for the Big 4 show at Yankee Stadium and concerts in India. It was also announced that they will be addressing their current amplifier line, both solid state and tube.http://www.rig-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t;=106530 In April 2012, Randall Amplification introduced Mike Fortin as an exclusive design engineer for Randall Amplification. As the founder of Fortin Amplification, Inc. he has forged a worldwide reputation for creating cutting edge high gain amplifier designs. His first priorities will be a new multi-channel, 150 watt Kirk Hammett Signature Model Head and a whole range of high end, high gain all tube amplifiers to be manufactured in North America. The new Fortin designed series of Randall amplifiers will replace the discontinued MTS Series. The collaboration produced a series high gain tube amplifiers such as the 667 and the Thrasher and several signature models. In addition to the Kirk Hammett signature models, Randall released the Ultimate Nullifier EN 120, a signature amp for Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian in 2014. Randall and Fortin also collaborated with The Haunted guitarist Ola Englund and designed a signature amp based on Englund's Fortin \\"Natas\\" amplifier called \\"Satan.\\"/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RfErzEs0f8 On January 1, 2016, Fortin announced his partnership with Randall had ended the previous day, and he would not be renewing his contract.  2014 The Fortin-designed flagship six-channel model 667 head was announced. Additionally, Randall entered the pedal market with the RG13 1 Watt, 3 channel amp/pedal, the Facepunch overdrive, MOR boost pedal, RGOD preamp pedal and RF8 8 button midi pedal.

Most of the Stone Bridge originates from the Ottoman period and throughout the centuries, the Stone Bridge was often damaged and then repaired. There is historical evidence that it once suffered during the great earthquake of 1555 which heavily damaged or destroyed four pillars. Renovations were carried out the same year. Some executions have also taken place on this bridge, such as the execution of Karposh in 1689. In 1944, explosives were placed on the bridge by Nazis. Upon a request from city notables, the Germans give up at the last minute and the bridge was saved from destruction. The last reconstruction of the bridge began in 1994. Over seven years during the Stone Bridge refurbishment of the 1990s, people were not allowed to cross the structure and for many craftsmen from the nearby Old Bazaar it resulted in negative economic effects. The watchtower shaped like a mihrab was reconstructed in 2008. Two parts of Skopje that have symbolised its urban contrasts of \\"Ottoman\\" or \\"modern\\", the \\"historic\\" or \\"socialist\\", \\"Albanian\\" or \\"Macedonian\\" are split by the river Vardar and linked by the Stone Bridge.

Unlike most Confederate monuments in Kentucky, it represents grief rather than Southern patriotism.Civil War in Kentucky Fund raising The Ladies Memorial and Monument Association was founded by Mary Cyrene Burch Breckinridge, the wife of John C. Breckinridge, on May 26, 1869, after she saw the unveiling of the Confederate Monument in Cynthiana, Kentucky. After six years of fund raising the memorial was dedicated on May 26, 1875. Description The statue features a marble cross shaped as if made of logs. A broken sword and broken flagstaff are among the motifs, which also include lilies. Rugged rocks are the motif for the limestone pedestal. It was designed by George W. Ranck (1841‚Äì1901), a Lexington historian, and paid for by the Ladies Memorial and Monument Association of Lexington. The cross was made in Italy, with the pedestal supplied by Louisville's Muldoon Monument Company. It was called \\"probably the most perfect thing of its kind in the South\\" by Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.trailsrus.com Inspiration It is believed that the memorial might have been inspired by a poem written by Abram Joseph Ryan, a Confederate chaplain: > Take that banner down! 'tis tattered; > Broken is its staff and shattered, > And the valiant hosts are scattered > Over whom it floated high.trailsrus.com The Confederate Soldier Monument in Lexington is a few feet away, and was also part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky MPS.

RNAS Hatston, also called HMS Sparrowhawk, was a Royal Naval Air Station, one mile to the north west of Kirkwall on the island of Mainland, Orkney, Scotland. It was located near the strategically vital naval base of Scapa Flow, which for most of the twentieth century formed the main base of the ships of the Home Fleet. History Hatston's main period of activity came during the Second World War, when it was host to a number of different types of aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, including Fairey Swordfish, Blackburn Rocs, Grumman Martlet IV and Grumman Avengers. Two squadrons of Blackburn Skuas flew from Hatston on 10 April 1940, on a mission to sink the German cruiser K√∂nigsberg, in which they were successful. After the end of the war, the airfield became the island's main airport, until 1948. By then British European Airways was operating Douglas Dakotas which were deemed too large to use the runways safely. They moved operations to a larger airfield, RAF Grimsetter, outside Kirkwall. The airfield remained in use from 1953 until 1957, when it was the home of the Orkney Flying Club, but was finally closed and turned into an industrial estate.

Mario \\"Maji\\" Melendez founded Rasta Taco, Inc. in November 2006 while on vacation in Jamaica. While there, he was astonished to find no tacos at any of the local jerk chicken stands or ‚Äúcorner stores‚Äù. The business plan was written on the back of a cocktail napkin by the pool and upon his return to the United States, Melendez created a mobile Mexican and Jamaican fusion taco cart catering concept. Rasta Taco catering Rasta Taco is the first company to establish the novelty \\"Mom & Pop\\" taco catering business platform, into a proven catering concept. Rasta Taco specializes in catering corporate events of any size, private parties, backyard gatherings, weddings and more. Rasta Taco creates taco entrees and sides with their original recipes of Mexican and Island spices, served directly from their specially-designed and unique mobile taco carts. Typical Rasta Taco dishes include Caribbean Carne Asada, Jamaican Chicken, Reggae Wraps, Bowls, Salads, and signature sauces and salsas.

The truck was rescued from a junkyard where she sat for several years until Melendez discovered her for sale on E-Bay for $1,000.00. Rasta Rita delivers fresh, organic Margaritas and specialty cocktails served from a fully restored 1965 GMC bread truck. Rasta Rita has a cult-like following on social media, as photos of Rasta Rita have been liked, followed or shared more than 10 million times. Margarita Lady As the success of Rasta Rita continued, Margarita Lady was launched in 2017 from a restored 1973 Chevy Balboa Vintage RV to assist with the demand of the Margarita truck business.

It is named for Westminster Choir College's founder, John Finley Williamson, who believed that choral music performed at the highest level should be accessible to all. The Choir is directed by conductor, pedagogue, and writer Dr.James Jordan The repertoire and performances of the Westminster Williamson Voices cover a broad spectrum, with special emphasis on music commissioned for the choir. The choir has had music written for it by a number of composers including Morten Lauridsen, Paul Mealor, and James Whitbourn. Artistic collaborations with other art forms‚Äîdance, theater, and the visual arts‚Äîare at the core of the performances of this ensemble. The ensemble presents artistic repertoire of both traditional and non-traditional genres, tailored to establishing high standards of performance in choirs in churches, schools, and universities. Williamson Voices' 2010‚Äì2011 season included concerts in Princeton and at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center, New York City. Collaborations in both this season and past have included performances with Daniel Stewart and members of the Curtis Symphony Orchestra, and Rossen Milanov with the Princeton Symphony Orchestra. On September 6, 2011, Williamson Voices' recording of music by James Whitbourn, produced by the composer, was released on Naxos. The album debuted on the Billboard Charts. The 2011‚Äì2012 season included concerts in Philadelphia at the Cathedral Church of Saints Peter and Paul, and in Princeton at the Princeton Meadow Church and Event Center. In May, 2012, the group recorded Whitbourn's Annelies, in its chamber version, released by Naxos in January 2013. Grammy Awards On Friday, December 6, 2013 it was announced that the Williamson Voices had been a nominated for a Grammy Award in the \\"Best Choral Performance\\" category for their recording of James Whitbourn's, \\"Annelies\\". Also featured on the album are Dr.James Jordan, James Whitbourn (Composer and Producer), The Lincoln Trio, Bharat Chandra, and Arianna Zukerman. The award for this category was presented at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014.  Pedagogical Significance  The Westminster Williamson Voices serves as a choral laboratory. Its primary musical mission is to explore new methods of teaching and rehearsing and to be at the forefront of choral education pedagogy. The teaching and learning of literature for performance use contemporary ensemble methods involving groundbreaking Aural Immersion Solf√®ge and movement pedagogy emphasizing both the philosophies of √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze and Rudolf von Laban. The ensemble also explores new avenues for the art of choral accompanying. The accompanist for the Westminster Williamson Voices assumes a new role, becoming the keystone for aural training for the choir. Consequently, its members gain valuable pedagogical tools to use in their life‚Äôs work as teachers and professional choral singers. The choir, in addition to being an artistic performing ensemble, is available to serve as an ensemble-in-residence in schools, churches, universities and professional conferences throughout the United States.James Jordan: Evoking Sound  Choral Institute at Oxford (St. Stephen's House)  The Westminster Williamson Voices, in collaboration with their conductor James Jordan and regular collaborator James Whitbourn, began the Choral Music Institute in the summer of 2013. The program takes place annually, and occurs at St Stephen's House.

It consists of a plastic plate worn over the swimmer's palm and attached over the back of the swimmer's hand with elastic cords. The plate is often perforated with a pattern of holes. A handle paddle increases the resistance the hand experiences as it tries to move through the water during the effective part of the arm stroke ‚Äì the part of the stroke described as the \\"pull\\". This gives the swimmer considerably more forward propulsion from the arm stroke than does a naked hand, and affords an enhanced kinesthetic \\"feel\\" of the pull. It also enhances the swimmer's feel of the \\"catch\\", the phase prior to the pull, where the hand turns from a streamlined position to grasp the water and begin the pull. If the hand catches or pulls at an incorrect angle, the increased resistance afforded by the hand paddle will exacerbate the resultant twisting moment, making the defect clearer to the swimmer. The considerably increased load imposed by the hand paddle on the arm and shoulder can, however, lead to pain and an increased risk of injury, so coaches advise only limited use of paddles and that use be discontinued if the swimmer feels shoulder pain. To make the most out of using paddles, it is important to ensure that they aid in establishing a good technique under the water. Use the paddles without the wrist strap or side straps, and only use the main finger holds in the middle, regardless of the brand. Paddles are often used with pull buoys to build up arm strength.  History  The hand paddle was invented by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century.International Swimming Hall of Fame Independence Hall Association  Types of paddles  Different types of paddles include: * Finger paddles ‚Äì Designed to fit on the fingers and built for all strokes, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. * Freestyle Paddles ‚Äì Designed especially for swimmers swimming freestyle. * Biomimetic Hand Paddles ‚Äì Influenced by the darkling beetle to reinforce kinesthetic feel for the water. Swim Paddles Share a Swimming Story in Nature * Han's Paddles ‚Äì The original holed swimming paddles. * Speedo Original Hand Paddles ‚Äì One of the first and made for most strokes. * Sculling and Vortex paddles ‚Äì Designed to build upper body strength. Hand Paddles, Kickboards, and Pull Buoys for Swimmers * Forearm paddles - Designed to extend passed the palm of the hand over the forearm to help with the initial catch * Anti-paddles - Designed with a conical shape on the bottom of the paddle to improves swimmer's reaction to water resistance  References  Category:Swimming equipment ","title":"Hand paddle"},{"id":"15052671","text":"William Galbraith was an American football coach.

It is the first entry in the series to feature actor Keye Luke, who would go on to become a mainstay in his role as Chan's \\"Number One Son\\" Lee. Plot Chan is on his way back from completing the London case‚Äîthey always mentioned the previous case‚Äîto go on \\"vacation\\" to Paris, but this is just a way to make people think that he is innocently there. He is on a case for some London bankers and customers who say that some bonds from the Lamartine Bank in Paris are forged, so they hired Chan to solve the case. The suspects Chan meets include; Max Corday, a local artist who wants to reap the financial rewards of fame; Albert Dufresne, the assistant to the bank president who is living beyond his means; Henri Latouche, a bank officer who has access to financial bank records; Yvette Lamartine, the daughter of the bank president who is determined to recover old love letters from her old boyfriend, Albert Dufresne; and Marcel Xavier, a crippled and blind beggar and \\"crazed World War I veteran who thinks that the bank is cheating on him and wants his money. After various murder attempts on Chan and other killings, including that of his assistant, Nardi, and the ex-boyfriend of Yvette. Chan realizes that the murders were staged by Xavier. But it turns out not to be the case. The murderer was Xavier, but he is actually not real; he has alternately been played by both Corday and Latouche; with Latouche appearing as Xavier when Corday was with Charlie, and Corday appearing as Xavier when Charlie meets Latouche at the Bank. Chan takes young Victor Descartes with him to find Xavier, and while they search Corday's and LaTouche's lair where they have been printing the counterfeit bonds, Latouche (as Xavier) arrives. Chan and Descartes kill the lights, and Latouche shoots at Chan's flashlight, apparently hitting him. But Chan has mounted it on a broomstick to decoy Latouche, and Descartes is able to capture Xavier/Latouche. Then the police arrive (summoned by Chan's son Lee), giving Chan a chance to explain how Corday and Latouche created alibis for each other by alternately playing Xavier.

O‚ÄôNeill was a two-sport athlete at Williams College where he played football and ran track. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951. College athlete 1901 Williams College football team captained by O'Neill O'Neill was a two-sport athlete at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He lettered in football in 1899, 1900, and 1901 and served as captain his senior year under coach J. J. Hazen. The Williams College team that O'Neill captained had an overall record of 6‚Äì4 with losses to Harvard, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Army. Even with those losses, the O'Neill-led team went on to win the 1901 Tricollegiante Football Association championship, with victories over league rivals Wesleyan and Amherst. O'Neill lettered three times in track where he ran the 440-yard race. As in football, he captained the track team his senior year. O'Neill placed third in the 440 at the 1901 New England Intercollegiate Athletic Association annual championship at the Worcester Oval in Worcester, Massachusetts. Williams College won the meet by less than a point. College coach O'Neill was the tenth head football coach at Colgate University and held that position for three seasons between 1902 and 1905. He coached at Syracuse University at three different times. After 1915, the year O'Neill founded his law practice in New York City, he had to cut back on his coaching duties. In his last three years at Syracuse, he acted more as an advisor than a full-time coach. Even with this arrangement, he was successful including in 1919 when the Orange gave Pittsburgh its first loss in five years. O'Neill moved to Columbia for 1920 season. Since his law office and his new team were in the New York City, he was able to spend more time with his football team. Unlike the previous football coaches at Columbia, O'Neill did not have to be a member of the physical education department. The goal for Columbia was to restore football to the standing it had when the last nationally-known coach Foster Sanford resigned in 1904. O'Neill guided Columbia to a winning record in his last of three years. He left to devote his full-time to his law practice after the 1922 season. In his last game at Columbia, he suffered one of the worst losses in his career, a 59‚Äì6 blowout to his old school, Colgate, on Thanksgiving Day. O'Neill's overall coaching record was 81‚Äì41‚Äì8. He was inducted in 1951 into the College Football Hall of Fame, where he is a charter member. Professional football coach In 1902, O'Neill resurrected the Syracuse Athletic Club, to take part in the 1902 World Series of Football, held at Madison Square Garden. O'Neill conducted daily practices in preparation for the series. Syracuse then defeated the \\"New York\\" team in what has been called the first indoor professional football game. The final score of the game was recorded as 6‚Äì0, but in reality it was 5‚Äì0, since touchdowns only counted for five points in 1902 and Syracuse's Pop Warner missed the extra point. Warner later suffered a head injury and was replaced by \\"New York's\\" Blondy Wallace. Syracuse went on to win the Series with a 36‚Äì0 victory over the Orange Athletic Club.

Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired a part-time coach, bearded James L. Morrison. He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \\"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform‚Ä¶They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \\"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work.

Morison had played tackle at the University of Michigan. He stressed conditioning, speed, and an abundance of end runs and convinced his players that conditioning and speed would lead them to victory. Such tactics led to an opening 14‚Äì0 win over Hillsdale. Next came Albion, fresh from a 26‚Äì12 loss to Michigan, who proved to be tough. The game ended in a 6‚Äì6 tie when substitute fullback John Studebaker fell on a fumble for the only Fighting Irish touchdown. At the conclusion of the two-week contract Morrison left campus to take the head coaching job at Hillsdale College. His Irish charges finished the year 3‚Äì1‚Äì1, losing only to Albion in the season finale. At Hillsdale, Morrison spent just one week. His Hillsdale team was shut out 12‚Äì0 on the road at Albion.

In Vietnam Borri's family was one of good standing in Milan. He became a member of the Society of Jesus, 16 September 1601; in 1616 he was sent from Macau with the Jesuit priest Marquez, as one of the first missionaries to ƒê√†ng Trong (knowns to the Europeans as Cocincina, now part of central Vietnam). He stayed at H·ªôi An from 1618 (or at the end of 1617) until 1622, being known under the name of Bruno.Silk for Silver: Dutch-Vietnamese Relations, 1637-1700 - Page 252 Anh Tu·∫•n Ho√†ng - 2007 \\"The Italian priest Christopher Borri, who lived in H·ªôi An between 1618 and 1622, recorded this incident: ...\\" At Coimbra After his return Borri taught mathematics at Coimbra; in 1632 he entered the Cistercian Order, taking the name of Father Onofrio, and died the same year. Borri's most important work Relatione della nuova missione delli P.P. della Compagnia di Ges√π al Regno della Cocincina appeared in Rome in 1631 and was translated into French, Dutch, Latin, German and English. It was also inserted in Churchill's Collection of Voyages (1704), and in and Sprengel and Forster's Neue Beitrage zur Volkerund L√§nderkunde (1793). The work was considered one of the best sources of information concerning Cochinchina on account of its detailed description of the physical, political, and ecclesiastical conditions of the country. Borri also made observations on the magnetic variation of the compass. According to Kircher (1641) he drew up the first chart for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans showing the spots where the magnetic needle makes the same angles with the meridian; if this is true, he should be regarded as the forerunner of Edmund Halley. Borrus gives the explanation to the chart in a manuscript that belongs to the Royal Academy at Lisbon. In another manuscript, now in √âvora, Tratada da arte de navegar pelo Cristovao Bruno, which bears on the same subject, he makes suggestions, according to Allatius (1633), as to a new method for determining the longitude at sea and also concerning improvements in sea-charts. Philip II of Spain, desiring to understand the Borrus' nautical studies and inventions, once summoned him from Coimbra to Madrid. He also wrote Doctrina de Tribus Coelis, Aereo, Sydereo et Empeireo, and also some accounts of his travels for the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide.

He played for the Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Career On June 6, 1967, Brye was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the amateur draft. He signed to play in the minor leagues in the Twins organization. Brye made his major league debut on September 3, 1970, with the Twins at age 21. He was hitless in his only at bat in his debut. That year, Brye had a batting average of .182 in 11 at-bats. In 1971, he hit .224 in 107 at-bats. The next year, he hit .241 in 253 at-bats. Brye hit .263 in 278 at-bats in 1973. In 1974 he won the starting centerfield job in spring training, and he hit .283 in 488 at-bats. Brye was also the Twins leader in doubles in his only season as a starter. The next year, however, he hit .252 in 246 at-bats. The next year, he hit .264 in 258 at- bats. On March 21, 1977, Brye was purchased by from the Twins by the Brewers. In 1977, he hit .249 in 241 at-bats. On March 30, 1978, Brye was released by the Brewers. Five days later, he signed with the Pirates, only to be released a few months later. In 1978, he hit .235 in 115 at-bats. On February 7, 1979, he was signed by the San Diego Padres. However, he retired before he could play with the Padres. Brye had a career batting average of .258, and finished with 1,997 at-bats in 697 games. He drove in 193 runs during his career. Brye hit 30 home runs over the course of his career. His lifetime fielding percentage was .991. Controversy Brye was involved in one of the biggest controversies in baseball on the final day of the 1976 season. Kansas City's George Brett and Hal McRae were in a near deadlock for the American League batting championship. In his final at-bat, Brett hit a routine fly-ball to left field, that Brye failed to catch, and it fell for a hit. There were accusations that Brye played it badly, to deny McRae, an African American, the batting championship. Within baseball circles, rumours persisted that Brye didn't see McRae as an equal to Brett because Brett played defense whereas McRae was a designated hitter. It was never conclusively established that Brye intentionally failed to retire Brett. ... This is total BS. Anyone who knows Steve Brye knows his character and that he would never have done something like that. Brett hit the ball off the end of his bat and the ball spun away from Brye, falling near the left-field line for a hit. Whoever wrote that it was a routine fly ball obviously never played the game.

Career Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Mitchell graduated from Worcester Academy in 1968 and was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 18th round of the 1968 MLB draft. Rather than turn professional, he opted to attend Old Dominion University on a baseball scholarship. From 1969-71 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Falmouth Commodores, leading Falmouth to the league championship in all three years and being named the league's outstanding pitcher in 1969 and 1970. Mitchell was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1st round (7th overall) of the secondary phase of the 1971 MLB draft.. He spent the 1972 season with the Double-A Asheville Orioles, and 1973-74 with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. He made his MLB debut for Baltimore on July 1, 1975 at Fenway Park against the Boston Red Sox, and finished the season with a 3-0 record and a 3.63 earned run average in 11 games.

Don Baylor was the third player sent over from Baltimore, and in addition to Jackson, the Orioles also acquired Ken Holtzman and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Van Bommel.\\"Orioles obtain Reggie Jackson; Baylor, Torrez go to Oakland,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Saturday, April 3, 1976. Retrieved March 20, 2016 Mitchell posted a 9-7 record for Oakland in 1976, but struggled early in 1977 and was dealt mid-season to the Seattle Mariners, who had joined the American League as an expansion team for the 1977 season. In 1978, Mitchell led Seattle pitchers in wins, posting an 8-14 record for a Mariners team that lost 104 games. In 1979, Seattle traded Mitchell to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Randy Stein. Mitchell made his final appearance with Milwaukee on September 21, 1980 against Seattle and was released prior to the 1981 season. In all, Mitchell pitched in six major league seasons, recording a career win-loss record of 32-39 in 162 appearances. He is tied with four others for the all-time major league career record for fielding percentage among pitchers who have at least 500 innings pitched. In 621.1 innings of work, Mitchell handled 114 chances, recording 32 putouts and 82 assists without a single error, for a perfect career fielding percentage of 1.000. In 2002, Mitchell was inducted into the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame, and in 2011 he served as honorary captain of the West Division team at the CCBL All-Star Game at Fenway Park.

The genus was first formally described in 1850 by the French botanist Achille Richard, who cited an earlier suggestion by the German botanist Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter. Richard recognized a single species, Orthochilus abyssinicus, and noted that the genus shared many features with the closely related genus Eulophia, but differed from it in the form of the pollen masses and caudicule, a stalk to which the pollen masses are attached. The genus Orthochilus has often been viewed as a synonym of the larger genus Eulophia by many botanists, but a recent molecular phylogeny published in 2014 revealed that Eulophia, as traditionally circumscribed, was paraphyletic unless Orthochilus was recognized as a separate genus.Martos, F., S.D. Johnson, C.I. Peter, and B. Bytebier. 2014. A molecular phylogeny reveals paraphyly of the large genus Eulophia (Orchidaceae): A case for the reinstatement of Orthochilus.

Paris: Arthus Bertrand. p. 284. As circumscribed by Martos et al., the genus Orthochilus includes many species formerly recognized as belonging to the large genus Eulophia and the smaller genus Pteroglossaspis. The species in Orthochilus can be readily identified as different from Eulophia in that their petals and sepals are similar in appearance (shape, size, and color) and the flowers are roughly bell-shaped (campanulate), whereas most Eulophia have sepals and petals that differ in appearance. Further study of other species currently assigned to Eulophia may increase the total number of species recognized within the Orthochilus clade.

Bruns was a typical German footballer. Powerfully built, technically good, strong in the tackle, and tactically excellent. Bruns was at Gladbach twice, his second stint reaching 10 years and encompassing 301 Bundesliga appearances with 55 goals scored. As a player, Bruns was the type to make bursting runs from deep in midfield. He supported attacks, instigated moves and helped defend his back-line. German football in the '70s and '80s had plenty of great players in that position. Having started out as a midfielder for Schalke, the North Rhine-Westphalia-born star eventually evolved into one of the finest sweepers of his generation. Part of the Gladbach side that went all the way to 1979 UEFA Cup glory, Bruns is part of Bundesliga folklore for a moment during an encounter with Bayern where he ran past almost every opposition player before seeing his shot strike both posts and fail to go in.https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/borussia- monchengladbach-all-time-xi-marco-reus-jupp-heynckes-juan-arango- dante-473784.jsp Years after his retirement, he achieved mild publicity as a result of a video shared on various video streaming and social media sites. The video, showing a clip from a 1983 match between Borussia M√∂nchengladbach and FC Bayern Munich, and titled The Greatest Goal Never Scored, showed Bruns collecting the ball under pressure near his own corner flag, beating three Bayern Munich players as he ran almost the entire length of the pitch, exchanging a pass with a Borussia M√∂nchengladbach striker that allowed him on goal, only for his shot to hit the inside of one post, roll across goal and hit the other post, before rebounding into the arms of the Munich keeper. Career Bruns did not register with a football club in his hometown until he was 11 years old, having spent many years playing soccer on the street. At 17, he moved to Schalke 04.ausf√ºhrliches Interview in: RevierSport 97/2011, S. 60.f In the Bundesliga he was from 1973 to 1990 for FC Schalke 04 , SG Wattenscheid 09, Fortuna Dusseldorf and Borussia M√∂nchengladbach active. In his first years as a professional, he played in midfield, later especially on the Libero position. In 1979, he was in the squad of the team Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, the UEFA Cup winner, and scored on the way to the final matches against Red Star Belgrade, in which he did not participate, one goal against Benfica and Manchester City. In 1980 he was DFB Cup winner with Fortuna Dusseldorf, 1984 he lost with Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in the final of the same competition to FC Bayern Munich on penalties. Bruns is responsible for one of the most famous posts goal of Bundesliga history. In the 1983/84 season he sprinted in Munich in the game against Bayern with a solo run past the opposing team behind the entire field. His shot hit the left inner post, the ball rolled on the goal line to the right post and jumped from there back into the field, where the Munich defense could then clear. International career He earned four caps for the West Germany national football team in 1984, and was included in the West German team for the 1984 UEFA European Football Championship, but did not play. Coaching career After retiring from professional football, Bruns initially worked as an insurance agent. In addition, he trained Adler Osterfeld in the Oberliga Nordrhein, later the VfB Speldorf in his hometown M√ºlheim and the SSVg Velbert. From 2006 he was coach of Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen and led the club in 2007 as the champion of the Oberliga Nordrhein back to the Regionalliga and in the successor season 2008 in the 2nd Bundesliga. In the season 2008/09 he moved to Rot-Weiss Oberhausen on the position of Sporting Director and thus exchanged with J√ºrgen Lugingerthe tasks. After Luginger had due to a persistent negative series on 1 February 2010 made his post available, Bruns jumped in as interim coach. On April 22, 2010, however, it was announced that he will retain both offices permanently in the 2010-11 season. On February 22, 2011 was decided after the 1: 3 against VfL Osnabr√ºck and due to disagreements within the club, to separate. Hans G√ºnter Bruns was replaced one day later by Theo Schneider.

History The western portion of the land on which Hamilton stands was settled by Jacob Stetler in late 1829 or 1830, and the eastern part by John Gallinger in 1831, the two being separated by what is now Hamilton Road (near its intersection with what would become State Road 38). According to a 1913 history of Clinton County, \\"tradition has it that these two men met under the shade of a tree, near where the two highways cross, on a Sunday and agreed to join in layout out the town plat, which agreement was thereafter carried to execution...\\" The plat, surveyed March 21, 1839 and recorded April 19, 1839, included 36 lots each on the east and west sides of the road; additional lots were added June 30, 1842. The first house in Hamilton was built by John Jamison, a saddler, who also ran a small shop. Later stores were operated by Waldron Drew, Mr. Frankenfield, and many others. Harvey Blacklidge operated the first blacksmith shop and was succeeded by Samuel Hammel who occupied the position of village blacksmith for many years. One of the most prominent people in Mulberry's early history was the village physician Dr. John Connor, \\"a very large, fleshy man, weighing perhaps three hundred pounds, though not tall. Seated on his two-wheeled cart and drawn by a fine sorrel horse, he was a familiar figure to all of the people living within several miles of the village.\\" Other prominent early citizens included cobbler Alfred Cornelison, who being disabled and unable to walk drove a dog team, James McDavis, Joseph Miller, Hamilton Yundt, Joseph Rex, Jonas Hammel, Jesse Sweet, Joseph Kauffman and William Sense. Hamilton reached a population of more than a hundred and was an active business center for the community, but it was eclipsed by nearby Mulberry which had the only railroad station in the township, and gradually dwindled during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He obtained a MBA (Diplom-Kaufmann) degree in 1940 and two years later gained his doctorate. From 1943 to 1945, Dollinger served in the Wehrmacht armed forces during World War II. Back in his hometown after the war, he joined his father-in-law's brickyard business. He became chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce in 1948 and of the Middle Franconian clay industry association in 1952. As a Protestant, Dollinger was a synod member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria from 1965 to 1995 and of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1971 to 1991.

Much of his career was spent in China and Japan where he published several newspapers including The Far East, a fortnightly newsmagazine illustrated with original photographs. Early life John Reddie Black was born in Dysart, Fife, Scotland to English parents. Little is known of Black's early life, but in 1854 he passed up the possibility of a career as an officer in the Royal Navy and moved with his wife to Australia. When his initial business ventures failed, Black embarked on a singing career,Under the name \\"John Roderick Black\\". Bennett, PiJ, 301. touring Australia, India, China, and finally Japan. Performances in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 1864 received enthusiastic reviews in the local press, as did his performances in Yokohama in June and July of the same year. Though he had no intention of staying in Japan, he was to remain there for another eleven or more years.Bennett, PiJ, 146‚Äì147. Career=Japan= In 1864, Albert Hansard, owner of the Japan Herald (among the first English-language newspapers in Japan), offered J. R. Black a job in his auction business, and in 1865 offered him a partnership in the newspaper.Bennett, PiJ, 147. In 1867, the partnership of Hansard and Black declared bankruptcy, but that same year Black founded his own newspaper, the Japan Gazette, a successful daily evening paper offering coverage of the reform movements of the Bakumatsu.Heinz and Miyoko, 135. He then founded The Far East, in 1870, with a view to promoting \\"goodwill and brotherhood between the outer world and the subjects of the most ancient imperial dynasty of the world\\".John Reddie Black, The Far East, No. 1, 1870. Quoted in Heinz and Miyoko, 135. The first issue appeared on 30 May 1870. The Far East provided articles on the history, arts, and manners and customs of Japan and was remarkable in that it was illustrated with pasted-in, original photographs, at a time when photomechanical reproduction was still in its infancy. The newspaper's in-house photographer was the Austrian, Michael Moser, but Black, an amateur photographer himself, supplemented Moser's images with his own.Moser worked for the newspaper until 1873. Bennett, PiJ, 147. Significant photographers whose work also appeared in the newspaper included Uchida Kuichi, the elder Suzuki Shin'ichi,Bennett, OJP, 93. and William Saunders.Bennett, OJP, 95. Black noted some of the early difficulties of publishing The Far East: the deleterious effects of the local weather on photographs, the inferiority and rarity of proper photographic chemicals and paper, and the poor quality (in his eyes) of the images produced by Japanese photographers. Until 1873, Black was unable or unwilling to pay the going rate for photographs, which must have particularly discouraged Western photographers from contributing. However, from 1873 on he began to pay an \\"honorarium\\" for the photographs he published.Bennett, PiJ, 147‚Äì148. From July 1874, The Far East was published in Shanghai. Accordingly, the photographic subjects appearing in the newspaper were now predominantly Chinese.Bennett, OJP, 94. There is no evidence of further publication of The Far East after December 1878.Bennett, PiJ, 149. Soon after establishing The Far East, and while maintaining the Japan Gazette,He later sold the newspaper, in 1874. Bennett, PiJ, 148. Black worked to launch a Japanese-language newspaper. He received little support in this endeavour from other residents of the foreign settlement, but convinced of the need for a high quality newspaper published in Japanese,Heinz and Miyoko quote him on the subject of the few existing Japanese-language newspapers of the day, which did not \\"[dare] to write leading articles nor to comment seriously on the occurrences of the day; and their columns were always defaced with such filthy paragraphs as to render them worse than contemptible in the eyes of foreigners\\"; and \\"among the samurai I chanced to meet from the time of my first arrival, I discovered such an amount of child-like ignorance of things connected with the outer world, coupled with such an earnest desire for information and instruction, that I thought that there could be no better means than the columns of a newspaper to give them what they required\\". John Reddie Black, Young Japan, vol. II, 1880. Quoted in Heinz and Miyoko, 135. and with the help of F. da Rosa, a Portuguese friend knowledgeable in Japanese and management, he founded Nisshin Shinjishi (Êó•Êñ∞Áúü‰∫ãË™å) with the permission of the government and the services of a Japanese editor.Heinz and Miyoko, 135. The Nisshin Shinjishi was based in Tokyo, and in 1874 its offices were also the home of The Far East until July. Bennett, PiJ, 148. The first issue appeared on 23 April 1872. The same year Black received authorisation to publish articles on government policy and the proceedings of the Daij≈ç-kan (Â§™ÊîøÂÆò), or Council of State. Black openly advocated political reforms, including free speech and greater democracy, and as he became increasingly influential the government manoeuvred to silence him, at the same time carefully avoiding any controversy with British officials. In 1874 the government offered Black the important post of foreign advisor to the Administrative Section of the Sa-in (Â∑¶Èô¢), a chamber of the Daij≈ç-kan, but only on condition that he resign from the Nisshin Shinjishi. He accepted the condition and the position. The following year new laws were introduced forbidding criticism of the government and excluding foreigners from editing Japanese-language newspapers.The laws introduced were the Defamation Law (Zamb√µritsu ËÆíË¨óÂæã) and Press Regulations (Shimbunshi J√µrei Êñ∞ËÅûÁ¥ôÊù°‰æã).
