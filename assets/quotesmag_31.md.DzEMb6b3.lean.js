Description In the 1972–1973 time frame, Walther introduced the Walther PP Super chambered in the cartridge for the West German Police. It might have been influenced by a relative success of Soviet 9×18mm Makarov, although most observe in the opposite (the Ultra cartridge is usually agreed to have been the design basis for the Makarov, with similar case length and a slightly wider and shorter projectile). It is often interpreted to be meant as an intermediate round between 9×17mm and 9×19mm Parabellum (as many intermediate rifle cartridges are meant to act as a medium between pistols and full power rifle rounds), fit for simple blowback pistols.Erenfeicht, Leszek (2018) (in Polish).

The cartridge was made available to the civilian market in 1975. It did not gain lasting popularity however.

Saint Joseph College in Yokohama was founded as a division of Gyosei High School before becoming a separately-run international school. It has since closed amidst much controversy.

History In 1992, a first version of the TIS 1099 standard (named TIS 1099-2535) was published, assigning codes to each of the then 72 provinces and the capital city of Bangkok. It followed a numbering scheme already used within the Ministry of Interior since the 1980s. The ISO standard 3199-2, first published in 1998, follows the codes of this standard. The draft version of ISO 3166 was based on the US standard FIPS 10-4, which assigns different numbers to the provinces. Additionally to the codes for the province and Bangkok, the ISO standard adds a special code for the special administrative area Pattaya, a code not present in the Thai standard. In 2005, the current version of the standard was published, introducing the codes for Amnat Charoen, Nong Bua Lam Phu and Sa Kaeo, created in 1993. It also introduced codes for every district and subdistrict, and some of the municipalities, especially those already existing before the sanitary districts were made into municipalities in 1999. Since the last publication of the standard, the province Bueng Kan and the district Galyani Vadhana as well as some subdistricts in Bangkok were created. Numerical codes for these entities have been assigned by the Ministry of Interior, which continues to publish regular updates to their code list. Structure Every province has a 2 digit numerical code assigned, starting with 10 for Bangkok till 96 for Narathiwat Province. However, not all codes in between are used, some are kept for future use. The first digit designates a region, based on the administrative region as they were in use in the 1950s. The second digit enumerates the provinces within the region. As there are now already 12 provinces in the region 4, the northern Isan, the codes 38 and 39 have been used for the latest provinces in this region. The districts have a four digit codes, starting with the two digits of the province and the second two digits enumerating the districts within that province. In some cases codes seem to have been omitted, but these actually are the codes of districts which were reassigned to a new province. Also, there were several districts ready to be created in 1998, however the Asian financial crisis put these to halt. Codes for these districts were already assigned. Wiang Kao District created in 2006 then received the code 4029, as 4026 to 4028 were assigned to abandoned district creations. However, when Galyani Vadhana District was created in 2012 it received the code 5025, even though it was in fact one of the abandoned districts of 1997 which would have received the number 5026. The subdistricts have a six digit code, adding another two digits to the code of the district in which they are located. Again, omitted codes within the enumeration of the subdistrict of one district belong to subdistricts which were reassigned to a different district, usually a newly created district. The municipalities listed in the standard also have four digit codes like the districts, however starting with 99 and counting down. The provincial capital always has the code ending in 99. For several provinces the number of municipalities is now so high that no longer all can receive a code within the scheme. While not part of the standard, the Ministry of Interior uses numerical codes for the administrative villages as the lowest subdivision based on the subdistrict codes by adding two digit containing the village number. However, unlike the higher levels of subdivisions, the villages get renumbered if some get reassigned to a different subdistrict, therefore the codes for villages are not stable in time. =Examples= *Bangkok: 10 *Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok: 1001 *Wat Sam Phraya Subdistrict, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok: 100112 *Chiang Mai Province: 50 *Chiang Mai City: 5099 ReferencesSee also *ISO 3166-2:TH *FIPS 10-4 External links *Geocode list of the Department of Provincial Administration Category:Geography of Thailand Category:Thai Industrial Standards ","title":"Thai Industrial Standard 1099-2548"},{"id":"41598257","text":"The North Monaghan by-election of 1907 was held on 20 June 1907.

Built in 1888 and rehabilitated in 2004-08, it is one of the few surviving lenticular truss bridges in Massachusetts, and the only known lenticular pony truss bridge. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Crossman Bridge is located just west of West Warren, on Gilbert Road just south of its junction with Main Street (Massachusetts Route 67). The bridge is long and wide, and is mounted on concrete abutments topped with granite slabs. The lenticular trusses have a maximum depth of about . The bridge deck is supported by a modern system of steel beams and stringers. A decorative railing, originally protective in nature, has been preserved, augmented by a modern guard rail. The bridge was built in 1888 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co. at a cost $2,175. It is only one of three known lenticular bridges in the state, and the only one that is a pony truss (without connection between the trusses above the roadway). It was the first metal bridge on the site, which has a history of bridge crossings dating to 1795. It was named for the A. W. Crossman factory, which stood just south of the river to the east of Gilbert Road. From 2004 to 2008, it was removed for repairs, rehabilitated and reassembled by U.S. Bridge of Cambridge, Ohio.

It is analogous to a room within a building, and may provide watertight subdivision of the ship's hull important in retaining buoyancy if the hull is damaged. Subdivision of a ship's hull into watertight compartments is called compartmentation. Transverse bulkheads appear horizontally in this photo of a battleship under construction. These compartments are formed by non-structural bulkheads. History Bulkhead watertight compartments were invented by the Chinese which strengthened the junks and slowed flooding in case of holing during the Han and Song dynasties. The wide application of Chinese watertight compartments soon spread to the Europeans through the Indian and Arab merchants. Watertight subdivision Watertight subdivision limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in the event of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety in the event of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.Manning, pp.146-148 A ship will sink if the transverse bulkheads are so far apart that flooding a single compartment would consume all the ship's reserve buoyancy. Aside from the possible protection of machinery, or areas most susceptible to damage, such a ship would be no better than a ship without watertight subdivision, and is called a one-compartment ship. A ship capable of remaining afloat when any single watertight compartment is flooded is called a two-compartment ship, but damage destroying the tightness of a transverse bulkhead may cause flooding of two compartments and loss of the ship. A ship able to remain afloat with any two compartments flooded is called a three-compartment ship, and will withstand damage to one transverse bulkhead. After the Titanic sinking, safety standards recommended spacing transverse bulkheads so no single point of damage would either submerge the end of the upper bulkhead deck or reduce bulkhead deck freeboard to less than . Wartime experience with torpedo damage indicated the typical damage diameter of defined a practical minimum distance for transverse bulkhead spacing. Doors Three types of doors are commonly used between compartments. A closed watertight door is structurally capable of withstanding the same pressures as the watertight bulkheads they penetrate, although such doors require frequent maintenance to maintain effective seals, and must, of course, be kept closed to effectively contain flooding. A closed weathertight door can seal out spray and periodic minor flow over weather decks, but may leak during immersion. These outward opening doors are useful at weather deck entrances to compartments above the main deck. Joiner doors are similar to doors used in conventional buildings ashore. They afford privacy and temperature control for compartments formed by non-structural bulkheads within the ship's hull. Nomenclature Compartments are identified by the deck forming the floor of that compartment. Different types of ships have different deck naming conventions. Passenger ships often use letters of the alphabet sequentially down from A deck (the highest) above B deck, and B deck above C deck, and so forth. Another popular naming convention is numbering the main deck 1, the deck below it 2 (or the second deck), and the deck below that the third deck, and so forth. Decks above the main deck may be named, like the bridge deck or poop deck,Manning, p.145 or they may be numbered upwards from the main deck with a zero prefix: 01 above the main deck, 02 deck above 01, and so forth. The United States Navy (USN) has used the latter convention in a compartment numbering system since 1949. The USN system identifies each compartment by a four-part code separated by hyphens. The first part of the code represents a numbered deck, the second part of the code is a hull support frame numbered sequentially from the bow, the third part of the code is a number representing compartment position with respect to the ship's centerline, and the fourth part of the code is alphabetic representing the use of that compartment. The centerline position code is zero for a compartment on the ship's centerline, odd numbers for compartments entirely to starboard of the centerline, and even numbers for compartments entirely to port. For compartments sharing the same deck and forward frame, the first two parts of the code are identical, and the third part of the code is numbered outward from the centerline. For example, four main-deck compartments at frame 90 would be 1-90-1-L inboard and 1-90-3-L outboard on the starboard side of the ship and 1-90-2-L inboard and 1-90-4-L outboard on the port side. The fourth part of the code is: * A for store rooms (or AA for cargo holds) * C for manned communication or control centers * E for manned engineering machinery spaces * F for oil storage tanks (or FF for oil cargo tanks) * G for gasoline-storage tanks (or GG for gasoline cargo tanks) * J for JP-5 storage tanks (or JJ for JP-5 cargo tanks) * K for chemical-storage spaces * L for living spaces, including sleeping, dining, washrooms, sick bay, and passageways. * M for ammunition magazines * Q for miscellaneous spaces not otherwise coded, including laundry, galley, pantries, wiring trunks, unmanned engineering, electrical and electronic spaces, shops, and offices. * T for vertical-access trunks (escape trunks) * V for void (empty) spaces * W for water-storage tanks References * * Notes Category:Shipbuilding Category:Buoyancy Category:Chinese inventions Category:Naval architecture Category:Nautical terminology Category:Ship compartments Category:Song dynasty Category:Watercraft components ","title":"Compartment (ship)"},{"id":"41598505","text":"The Plan Man (; lit. \\"Plan Man\\") is a 2014 South Korean romantic comedy film that tells the story of an anal retentive man who attempts to escape from his fixation of trying to plan out every detail of his life.

In 2008 she suffered further damage when Hurricane Ike hit the area, and the vessel bottomed out and sat at a ten‐degree list. According to Google Earth, the vessel was removed from Little Sand Island between May 2010 and July 2011. USNS Upshur is associated with noted naval architect George G. Sharp and participated in several notable events in U.S. history, but, based on her current condition, MARAD has determined that she is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Upshur was scrapped at Brownsville, Texas in 2011.

The thirteenth observed tropical cyclone, eleventh tropical storm, and fourth hurricane of the 1942 Atlantic hurricane season, this storm was detected in the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5\\\\. Initially a tropical storm, it strengthened slowly while moving westward and then south-southwestward across the Bahamas. On November 6, the storm became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that day, it made landfall in Cayo Romano, Camagüey Province, Cuba. Impact in Cuba and the Bahamas was limited to lower barometric pressure readings and strong winds. While crossing Cuba, the system weakened to a tropical storm early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the Caribbean Sea. The storm re-strengthened into a hurricane later that day and headed southwestward. Late on November 8, this system curved westward and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. Six hours later, it peaked with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Early on November 9, the storm struck Caye Caulker and northern Belize District. Rapidly weakening, the system fell to tropical storm status within 12 hours of landfall. By early on November 10, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. The storm meandered erratically until striking the Yucatán Peninsula on November 11 and dissipating hours later. Strong winds were observed in Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Severe damage was reported in the former. About 90% of structures in San Pedro Town were destroyed, while Newtown was completely obliterated, causing its residents to relocate and establish the village of Hopkins. Trees and crops such as coconuts also suffered heavy losses. Overall, nine deaths and approximately $4 million (1942 USD) in damage were reported. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved through the West Indies between November 3 and November 4. The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and caused it to re-curve west-southwestward on November 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC on November 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path. Around midday on November 8, the storm curved westward while approaching Belize and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 110 mph (175 km/h); this may be a conservative assessment, as it is possible the storm strengthened into a major hurricane, but there was no conclusive data. This storm was the only known hurricane to strike Belize in the month of November. At about 0000 UTC on November 9, the storm struck Caye Caulker and then northern Belize District at the same intensity. An observatory in Belize City recorded a barometric pressure of – the lowest in association with this storm. The storm rapidly weakened inland and fell to tropical storm intensity by 1200 UTC on November 9\\\\. It then curved northwestward, reaching the Bay of Campeche early on November 10\\\\. The storm drifted erratically to the west of the Yucatán Peninsula and eventually curved southeastward. Around 1200 UTC on November 11, the system made another landfall near Campeche, Campeche with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Less than six hours later, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated shortly thereafter. Impact In the Bahamas, a barometric pressure reading of and force 9 sustained winds on the Beaufort scale were observed on at Georgetown on Exuma. No damage was reported in that country. Strong winds were reported in some areas of Cuba. Cayo Paredon Grande in Camagüey Province recorded sustained winds of , while the city of Camagüey observed wind gusts up to . In Mexico, the storm struck the Gulf Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula near Campeche, Campeche, where wind gust of force 9 on the Beaufort scare were observed. In Quintana Roo, damaged vegetation fueled a large forest fire. Although the storm's intensity was equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, sustained winds in Belize reached only . Damage from the hurricane was mainly limited to an area along the coast about north to south and east to west. In San Pedro Town, about 90% of structures were destroyed. Newtown was completely demolished, causing its resident to establish the city of Hopkins further south. At Ambergris Caye, many houses and coconut plantations were damaged or destroyed. This forced many laborers and coconut plantation owners to seek new professions; most of them entered the fishing industry. Nine deaths were reported, though the toll may have been higher, as numerous small fishing boats were beached or swept out to sea. Widespread damage to vegetation and trees occurred. An assessment of damage after the storm indicated that more than 75% of the canopy species had been destroyed. Although the low bush was not badly damaged, about 25% to 50% of the pine trees were toppled. Damage on deep soils was largely from breakage while on shallow soils mostly from wind throw. Tides along the coast split Caye Caulker into three separate islands and swept away \\"everything in its path\\". Overall, damage totaled approximately $4 million, with $1 million to private and public property, including buildings and dwellings. The remaining $3 million in damage was incurred to coconuts and other crops; this total possibly includes damage to the mahogany and chicle industries.

It is used as a drug to treat primary biliary cholangitis, and is undergoing development for several other liver diseases and related disorders. Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. hold the worldwide rights to develop OCA outside Japan and China, where it is licensed to Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. Invention and development The natural bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, was identified in 1999 as the most active physiological ligand for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is involved in many physiological and pathological processes. A series of alkylated bile acid analogues were designed, studied and patented by Roberto Pellicciari and colleagues at the University of Perugia, with 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid emerging as the most highly potent FXR agonist. FXR-dependent processes in liver and intestine were proposed as therapeutic targets in human diseases. Obeticholic acid is the first FXR agonist to be used in human drug studies. Clinical studies Obeticholic acid is undergoing development in phase 2 and 3 studies for specific liver and gastrointestinal conditions. The United States Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Ocaliva on May 27, 2016 for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. It was approved as an orphan drug based on its reduction in the level of the biomarker alkaline phosphatase as a surrogate endpoint for clinical benefit. It is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. Additional studies are being required to prove its clinical benefit. =Primary biliary cholangitis= Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), also known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an auto-immune, inflammatory liver disease which produces bile duct injury, fibrosis, cholestasis and eventual cirrhosis. It is much more common in women than men and can cause jaundice, itching (pruritus) and fatigue. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is beneficial, but the disease often progresses and may require liver transplantation. Animal studies suggested that treatment with FXR agonists should be beneficial in cholestatic diseases such as PBC. OCA at doses between 10 mg and 50 mg was shown to provide significant biochemical benefit, but pruritus was more frequent with higher doses. The results of a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study of OCA, 5 mg or 10 mg, compared to placebo (POISE) were presented in April 2014, and showed that the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a significant reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or death. =Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)= Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a common cause of abnormal liver function with histological features of fatty liver, inflammation and fibrosis. It may progress to cirrhosis and is becoming an increasing indication for liver transplantation. It is increasing in prevalence. OCA is proposed to treat NASH. A phase 2 trial published in 2013 showed that administration of OCA at 25 mg or 50 mg daily for 6 weeks reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis and increased insulin sensitivity. The Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial, sponsored by NIDDK, was halted early in January 2014, after about half of the 283 subjects had completed the study, when a planned interim analysis showed that a) the primary endpoint had been met and b) lipid abnormalities were detected and arose safety concerns. Treatment with OCA (25 mg/day for 72 weeks) resulted in a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary histological endpoint, defined as a decrease in the NAFLD Activity Score of at least two points, with no worsening of fibrosis. 45% (50 of 110) of the treated group had this improvement compared with 21% (23 of 109) of the placebo-treated controls. However concerns about longterm safety issues such as increased cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular events may warrant the concomitant use of statins in OCA-treated patients. =Portal hypertension= Animal studies suggest that OCA improves intrahepatic vascular resistance and so may be of therapeutic benefit in portal hypertension. An open label phase 2a clinical study is under way. =Bile acid diarrhea= Bile acid diarrhea (also called bile acid malabsorption) can be secondary to Crohn's disease or be a primary condition. Reduced median levels of FGF19, an ileal hormone that regulates increased hepatic bile acid synthesis, have been found in this condition. FGF19 is potently stimulated by bile acids and especially by OCA. A proof of concept study of OCA (25 mg/d) has shown clinical and biochemical benefit. FDA Label Update On February 1, 2018, the FDA updated label warnings for Obeticholic acid to better explain recommended dosing. According to the agency, misunderstanding led some health care professionals to improperly dose the drug on a daily basis rather than weekly, which can increase the risk of liver damage.

Vaughan served as the Executive Director of the Guilford Green Foundation, an LGBT advocacy group, from February 2016 until January 2018.  Political Career  Greensboro first elected Nancy Vaughan to city council in 1997 in council district 4. She served two terms before leaving to raise her daughter, Catherine. Her political career was born in a fight against the city's plans for a tract of land formerly owned by Jefferson Pilot. She petitioned to stop them from re- zoning for higher density. Other issues she focused in her run were expanding the city's landfill and water capacity, and increasing Greensboro's size through annexation. She ran again at-large in 2007, where she served as Mayor Pro tem until becoming mayor in 2013.thumb = Tenure as Mayor = Vaughan has come under criticism for enforcing an arbitrary code of conduct at city council meetings. These rules prohibit citizens from speaking on matters \\"in litigation\\" or speaking in a way that Vaughan \\"deem[s] to be an 'attack'\\" on any city employee. This move was criticized by citizens, watch groups, and multiple members of city council who say they were not informed of the code of conduct before Vaughan began enforcing it at the October 2 city council meeting. During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Vaughan declared a state of emergency on March 13, 2020. On March 27, she issued a stay-at-home order for the city of Greensboro, which expired April 16, after which Greensboro fell under the jurisdiction of the state's stay-at-home order. On June 23, she issued an emergency order requiring all people to wear face coverings in public within Greensboro city limits in order to curb the spread of the pandemic. In response to protests stemming from the 2020 George Floyd protests that led to some damage to downtown businesses , the mayor ordered a city-wide curfew. The ACLU of North Carolina called the order unconstitutional and \\"overbroad\\", saying it \\"gives police too much discretion over whom to arrest and will likely lead to selective law enforcement against communities of color.\\" Local news media drew attention to the contrast in enforcement. The Greensboro Police Department arrested and charged several black men for protesting while carrying firearms, while white men associated with the white supremacist Stokes County Militia group carrying guns and paramilitary gear were not approached by police.

Due to his bizarre appearance in Rome on Palm Sunday 1484 he has been believed by some scholars to have not actually existed, but this has been contested with other reports that corroborate his eccentricities. His most notable follower was Lodovico Lazzarelli, an Italian humanist poet and alchemist, who writes his accounts of da Correggio in his Epistola Enoch.  Biography = Early life = Giovanni da Correggio was born sometime around 1451 to a noble family in Bologna, and was probably the illegitimate son of a certain Antonio da Correggio (not the artist), who died in 1474.Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 102. Da Correggio is probably from the same feudal family that produced Niccolò da Correggio.Kristeller (1993), pp. 213 He does not appear to have had any formal education in academics, oration, grammar, or rhetoric,Churton (2002), pp. 45Ruderman (1975), pp. 314 but nevertheless goes on to become a very eloquent wandering preacher. The first account of da Correggio was on 12 November 1481 in Rome, where Lodovico Lazzarelli encounters him as an apocalyptic preacher trying to gain the attention of the pope (Sixtus IV) and the College of Cardinals. Lazzarelli was so taken in by da Correggio that he decides to be his pupil. This meeting is reported by Lazzarelli to have been a turning point in his life and studies. It is possible that Lazzarelli may have introduced da Correggio to Hermetic philosophy and writings. = Palm Sunday 1484 = On Palm Sunday, 11 April 1484 da Correggio is reported by Lazzarelli to have been in Rome dressed in rich garments and gold with four servants. Lazzarelli reports that da Correggio then exits the city of Rome, and returns riding on a white donkey in imitation of Jesus. He is wearing blood-stained linen garments, a crown of thorns, on top of which is a silver crescent moon shaped disk. He then travels up to Saint Peter's Basilica and walks right up to the altar. Da Correggio places upon the altar his mystical apparel and a paper entitled The Eternal Gospel, knelt to pray, and then left. He proclaimed that he was \\"Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio\\" (or the Latin equivalent: \\"Iohannes Mercurius de Corigio\\"), \\"the angel of wisdom,\\" \\"Poimandres\\" (or Pimander, a Hermetic manifestation of the mind of God), and \\"the most perfect manifestation of Jesus Christ.\\"Churton (2002), pp. 44. He distributed scrolls that read: \\"Ego Joannes Mercurius de Corigio, sapientiae angelus Pimanderque in summo ac maximo spiritus Jesu Chrisi excessu, hanc aquam regni pro paucis, sic super omnes magna voce evangelizo.\\"Ruderman (1975), pp. 313. According to Lazzarelli da Correggio did all this completely unaccosted.Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 102-103. The only other account of da Correggio's Palm Sunday appearance in Rome was written by Abraham Farissol, an Italian Jewish scholar and scribe, in his Magen Avraham, who was in Rome at the time. According to Farissol da Correggio never even made it to the altar, but was arrested for heresy. According to Farissol da Correggio also calls himself \\"Son of God,\\" \\"Hermes Trismegistus,\\" \\"Enoch,\\" and \\"Methuselah.\\" Later da Correggio escapes from prison, possibly with the assistance of some friends.Ruderman (1975), pp. 311-312. According to both Lazzarelli and Farissol, after leaving Rome, da Correggio returns to Bologna to his wife, Elana Marie,Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 110 and five children. Upon arriving in Bologna da Correggio is arrested again with new charges of heresy, but either escapes from prison in BolognaRuderman (1975), pp. 312. or is released.Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 103. = Later life = After 1484 Giovanni da Correggio begins to wander from city to city preaching. Accounts of his appearances throughout Italy are scarce and scattered. The first appearance of da Correggio since Palm Sunday is on 4 July 1486 in Florence while on his way to Naples. Lazzarelli was in the court of Ferdinand I of Naples at the time, and Ferdinand I requested to meet with da Correggio. While in Florence da Correggio is ordered to be arrested by Lorenzo de' Medici and accosted by a Franciscan inquisitor. It is unclear if da Correggio ever made it to Naples. He is reported to have been in Cesena in 1484,Kristeller (1993), pp. 112 but it is unclear if this was prior to or after his appearance in Rome on Palm Sunday. It could easily be both, as he would have had to travel through Cesena to get from Rome to Bologna if he did not travel through Florence. Additionally he is reported to have been in Rome again 1492 in hopes of meeting with Pope Alexander VI. In Rome he begins to proclaim himself to be the \\"Younger Hermes\\" (implying that he is either the son of Hermes Trismegistus or Hermes Trismegistus reincarnated, hence the adoption of \\"Mercuio\\" to his name).Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 103 In 1494 he is reported to be in Lucca vainly trying to get to Florence. He apparently gets to visit Florence again in 1496. He is reported in Venice in 1497. In 1499 he is reported in Rome again seeking a meeting with the pope, as well as in Cesena on his way to Milan. While in Cesena he is seen wearing sackcloth and accompanied by his wife and five children. While da Correggio was originally from a noble family, and he seems to have been wealthy given the lavish and rich garments he wore in Rome in 1484 before he paraded around in imitation of Jesus, he appears to be truly destitute beginning in 1499. From this point forward he is always seen traveling with his entire household, begging on the streets, and dressed in sackcloth. It is possible he could have wasted his fortunes in alchemical pursuits,Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 110. which was not uncommon in the 15th Century. Hanegraaff puts forth the conjecture that Lazzarelli not only introduced da Correggio to Hermeticism, but may have also introduced him to alchemy sometime after 1495. In 1495 Lazzarelli met Johannes Rigaud de Branchiis, an alchemist, and decided to be de Branchiis' pupil as well. (Lazzarelli dedicated his transcription of Petrus Bonus’ Pretiosa Margarita Novella to his \\"teacher Joannes,\\" though it is unclear if this dedication was directed toward de Branchiis or da Correggio;Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 111-112 but it is certain that the Epistola Enoch, credited to Lazzarelli, is dedicated to da CorreggioRuderman (1975), pp. 310). Despite being destitute or impending destitution that same year, 1499, da Correggio published his Against the Barbarians, the Turks, and the Scyths (it is unclear if he published this before or after becoming a beggar), which he presented in Lyons to King Louis XII in 1501. Sometime after visiting France he published a plague tract.Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 104 It is unclear when da Correggio traveled to Ferrara, but Farissol reports to have seen him in Ferrara. This is appropriate as Carlo Sosenna, a humanist scholar, poet, and magician at the University of Ferrara, writes a commentary on a sonnet attributed to da Correggio. It is known that Sosenna was friendly with the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole I d'Este, as both held an interest in astrology and divination. Ruderman speculates that da Correggio may have met the duke through Sosenna.Ruderman (1975), pp. 314. Lazzarelli, Farissol, and Sosenna are the only three persons to have written about anything concerning Giovanni da Correggio who also were contemporary with him. There is another notable contemporary to have written about da Correggio, but it is unlikely he ever encountered the man in person. Johannes Trithemius writes about da Correggio boasting of himself as knowing all the learnings of the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins.Ruderman (1975), pp. 313 It is unlikely Trithemius ever met da Correggio, or even traveled to Italy. It is more probable that he learned of da Correggio's existence through the writings of Lazzarelli, which were circulated among scholars and alchemists in Germany at that time. It is known that Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a notorious German alchemist, had access to Lazzarelli's Hermetic writings, as he quotes a portion of Lazzarelli's Crater Hermetiis in his The Three Books of Occult Philosophy.Agrippa, Three Books, Book III, Chapter XXXVI, pp. 582. The last that is ever heard of da Correggio is in 1506 while he was meeting with Pope Julius II in Rome. Da Correggio had just published his De Quercu Iulii Pontificis, Sive De Lapide Philosophico (On the Oak of Pope Julius, or On the Philosopher's Stone), and presented it to the pope. Given da Correggio's state of poverty, Hanegraaff conjectures that De Quercu was a desperate last attempt by da Correggio to secure a source of funding to provide for himself and his family. He appeals to Julius II by mentioning that they had met before face-to-face in Savona (possibly before Julius II was pope), as if attempting to imply a stronger connection between the two men. Mostly da Correggio appeals to Julius II by regularly using the oak tree as an emblem of majesty, protection, power, and beauty (Julius II was formerly Giuliano della Rovere; Rovere meaning oak), describing the pope's oak as a sort of world tree. He makes use a popular alchemical symbol, the phoenix (often associated with the philosopher's stone), which he says perches on the upper branches of the papal tree. Da Correggio then goes on to discuss the philosopher's stone and quintessence, and all the virtues therein. He implies that he possesses these secrets, if only the pope would give him and his family protection. Da Correggio writes De Quercu as if he is the conduit of a divine entity, imploring the pope's help in the third person: \\"Give our Giovanni Mercurio your help and I will help you.\\" It is uncertain if Julius II ever secured any help for da Correggio, but given that there are no other documentations concerning Giovanni da Correggio after this meeting with the pope, then it can be surmised that Julius did not assist da Correggio and he and his family perished in poverty sometime thereafter.Hanegraaff (2007), pp. 104-110  Controversy of Existence  The first modern authority to describe Giovanni da Correggio was Kurt Ohly while he was researching Lazzarelli's Epistola Enoch in 1938. Ohly found the man to be so strange that he concluded that da Correggio was a fictitious invention of Lazzarelli. Ohly came to this conclusion because of the scarcity of other accounts concerning da Correggio. Paul Oskar Kristeller was the next authority to write about da Correggio while researching Hermetic documents and manuscripts in the Viterbo Municipal Library.Churton (2002), pp. 46 Kristeller found other accounts of da Correggio in other cities in the latter half of the 15th Century, citing namely a letter from the Medici Archives reporting da Correggio was in Lucca in 1494. Other sources found by Kristeller include the Harley Manuscript 4081 in the British Museum, better known as De Quercu,Kristeller (1993), pp. 220 as well as da Correggio's sonnet with Sosenna's commentary. Kristeller dissented against Ohly's conclusion, now concluding that Giovanni da Correggio had in fact existed. Since Kristeller other scholars have brought to the forefront other accounts of da Correggio. Among them are David Ruderman in Abraham Farissol's Magen Avraham. It is generally agreed upon that Giovanni da Correggio did in fact exist.  References  * Churton, Tobias. \\"The Golden Builders\\".

It was aired on January 8, 2014. The episode was written by Jeffrey Richman and directed by Gail Mancuso. Plot Phil (Ty Burrell) tricks Luke (Nolan Gould) into taking some ballroom dance lessons by lying to him that they will go to an \\"autopsy camp\\". Luke is very unhappy after his first lesson and is angry at Phil. On their way back home, they are pulled over by an officer for what seems to be just a license and registration check. However, Phil ends up in jail thanks to a pile of unpaid parking tickets from Haley (Sarah Hyland). Phil calls Claire (Julie Bowen) to ask her to come and bail him out, but Claire can not remember Phil's complex mnemonic codes of where the money is. She searches all over the house and when she finally finds it after a couple of hours, she heads to the jail to bail Phil out. In the meantime, Alex's (Ariel Winter) test for her driving license is soon and because Claire can not stand being with Alex in the car while she is driving, she is secretly paying Haley to drive with her for her lessons. Alex does not know about it until Claire calls Haley to tell her that her father is in jail because of her unpaid parking tickets. Alex starts giving her a lesson about how to park and Haley, to make her stop, tells her that their mom pays her to drive with her. Meanwhile, Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) continue their wedding plans and try to find a venue for the upcoming event. They find the perfect place that Cam always wanted, but Mitch is hesitant to book it due to the cost. In the few minutes they take to decide, the place is booked for the date they wanted by one of Cam's students for her Sweet 16 party. Mitch and Cam are not willing to pick another date so Cam comes up with a plan. He knows that his student was going to have the party with her best friend someplace else, but the two girls Tracy (Alisha Boe) and Sophie (Ariela Barer) get into a fight; his plan is to make them up so they will have the party together as they originally planned and give up the location he and Mitch want. Both of them manage to get the two girls back together, but the final result is not what they hoped. At the Pritchett house, Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Gloria (Sofía Vergara) plan a birthday party for Joe's first birthday while Manny (Rico Rodriguez) fusses over a girl named Amy, who left her coat over at their house during his own birthday party the previous night. Jay believes that Amy is out of Manny's league and he convinces Gloria to talk to Manny about another girl who has a crush on him but he is not noticing her. Gloria tries to talk to Manny but when she sees what he prepares for Amy, she changes her mind. At the end of the episode, the whole family gathers for Joe's birthday party. Phil and Claire are mad at Haley for not paying her parking tickets while Alex and Luke are mad at them each for their own reasons; Alex because Claire does not want to drive with her and Luke because Phil took him to dance lessons. Haley manages to calm Alex and Luke down so they will not be mad at their parents by telling them the \\"real reasons\\" of why they did what they did and she seems to escape her punishment for not paying her tickets. Cam and Mitch argue about how they missed the date they wanted to book for their wedding and Cam accuses Mitch that if he was not hesitant they would get the date they wanted. The argument leads Gloria and Claire to admit that it took them some time until they come around to Jay and Phil, but they did eventually. Same goes with Joe who Jay was trying to make him say daddy all day and he finally said \\"Jay\\". The whole discussion makes Jay to accept the fact that Manny tries to be with a girl that is out of his league and he wishes him good luck since she might also come around eventually. Reception=Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"And One to Grow On\\" was watched by 9.51 million; down 1.10 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"And One to Grow On\\" received mixed reviews. Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5/5 naming Haley the MVP of the episode: \\"She is by no means a smart girl, but dammit if she doesn't pull off some of the best stunts on this show. People underestimate her. Look at her tonight, she managed to take the heat off of her parents when Alex and Luke were flipping out. She did it all on the spot too!\\" and also praising the scenes of Phil and Luke together: \\"Phil and Luke are comedic gold together. Their entire interaction in the car was amazing.\\" Britt Hayes of Screen Crush gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"This week’s episode isn’t so much about getting people or things to be the way you want them as it is about being patient with those you love. And it doesn’t hurt that it brought a few laughs along with it.\\" Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club gave a C rating to the episode, remarking that the episode was weird but \\"not weird in a good way, not interesting or daring or ambitious, just kind of generally lumpy, arrhythmic and not-quite-right.\\" But he, like Raines, praised the scene of Luke and Phil: \\"There were some funny moments sprinkled around the episode. In particular, I liked Phil and Luke’s car scene prior to Phil’s arrest. Nolan Gould’s performance has started to grate on me as Luke has transitioned from a daffy, snarky kid to a yelpy young adult, but he and Ty Burrell really sold the scene, especially Phil’s wounded reactions to Luke’s mockery of Footloose.\\" Madina Papadopoulos from Paste Magazine gave the episode only 4.6/10 saying that the show left 2013 with a bang and begun 2014 with a bust and that the plot and jokes felt a little scattered and forced. \\"This episode was unfortunately underwhelming—something reflected by its title, “And One to Grow On,” reflects this week’s quality.\\" ReferencesExternal links  \\"And One to Grow On\\" at ABC.com Category:Modern Family (season 5) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"And One to Grow On"},{"id":"41599106","text":"Obsession is a Filipino medical drama series broadcast by TV5 starring Bianca King, Neri Naig, Martin Escudero and Marvin Agustin.

Recorded Books was formerly an independent audiobook company before being purchased and re-organized under RBMedia, where it is now an imprint. Recorded Books was founded in 1978 by Henry Trentman, one of the pioneers in the audiobook industry. History Recorded Books was founded in 1978 by Henry Trentman in Charlotte Hall, Maryland. Trentman was a salesman who spent a lot of his time driving and listening to the radio and he believed there was a market for better quality recorded books on cassette tape targeted to commuters. Unlike other audiobooks sold at the time, which were usually abridged to 2–4 hours long, Trentman envisioned unabridged productions of 20 or more tapes which could be rented mail-order, and that would be of high quality sound and professional narrators. The company's first recording was in 1979 as The Sea-Wolf by Jack London narrated by Frank Muller, a local actor at Washington DC's Arena Stage. Muller remembered \\"this traveling salesman who had a crazy idea about recording books onto cassettes and marketing them to commuters.\\" Muller would remain one of Recorded Books' most prolific and popular narrators over the years. At first the book titles were in the public domain (such as Jack London), however after Recorded Books picked professional stage actor Alexander Spencer to narrate books they began branching out into copyright works. For the first six years, Trentman worked at Recorded Books part-time since the company did not generate enough revenue to justify his coming on full-time. Later, as the company grew during the 1980s, it opened a new recording facility in New York City near Times Square. According to The New Yorker (2012): :It actually took about six years for Recorded Books to catch on. At first, people thought that audiobooks were for the blind.. Commercial audiobooks started to take off in the early eighties, when suburbanites discovered that they were an ideal way to mitigate the horrors of long car commutes. [According to Claudia Howard of Recorded Books] \\"The business was, in those days, a primitive Netflix in that they were rental businesses. You'd call an 800 number with your credit card and rent your cassette book for thirty days through the mail. It came in a cardboard box with a row of cassettes. Eventually, they were on CDs. The last ten years has been the download—you stream them straight to your computer or download straight to your cell phone.\\" In the 1980s, the company established its headquarters in Prince Frederick, Maryland. In the 1990s, it created an in- house sales department and a department to focus on schools and education. In 1997, Recorded Books began selling directly to the U.K. and by 1999 the company had launched W.F. Howes Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in the U.K. Recorded Books was acquired by Haights Cross Communications in December 1999, where Recorded Books operated as a division of that company. In 2002, Haights Cross acquired Audio Adventures, a brand established in the truck stop market to tie in with 650 rental kiosks in truck stop centers Recorded Books previously had. In January 2014, it was announced that Haights Cross sold Recorded Books to Wasserstein & Co., an independent private equity and investment firm in New York and Los Angeles. In May 2014, Recorded Books acquired HighBridge Audio from Workman Publishing. HighBridge Audio was initially founded by Minnesota Public Radio in the early 1980s to produce and distribute recordings of Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion. Since then, HighBridge produced approximately 45 titles a year in the forms of spoken word audio cassettes, CDs and downloadable audio books. The company was best known for publishing public-radio related titles, as well as Oprah's Book Club titles. HighBridge made use of two readers in its audio book production for works primarily involving two main characters. Other popular titles published by HighBridge included The Time Traveler's Wife, Water for Elephants, Life of Pi and Across the Nightingale Floor. In January 2015, Recorded Books announced its acquisition of Tantor Media Later in 2015, Wasserstein sold Recorded Books to Shamrock Advisors, a private equity firm. In April 2017 the company reorganized. The new company name is RBMedia and its imprints include Recorded Books, HighBridge Audio, Tantor Media, ChristianAudio, Gildan Media, W.F. Howes (UK), and Wavesound (Australia). It would sell or distribute titles directly to customers through audibooks.com, through libraries and resellers such as Audible. As of 2017, Recorded Books operates as an imprint of RBMedia. In June of 2020, Recorded Books announced a deal for Blackstone Audio to exclusively manufacture, sell and distribute their physical media audiobook titles (CD & MP3) to consumers, retail, distribution and libraries in North America. Sales and operations Although Recorded Books is not a public company, they have released some operations and sales figures over the years that provide a sense of the company's growth and size. According to a 2004 article, most of Recorded Books' 330 employees were based in Maryland, with 15 staff in New York, 15 in the United Kingdom and a number of sales representatives around the United States. Studio director Claudia Howard who had been with the company since 1984 oversaw operations. In a 1989 newspaper article, it was reported that Recorded Books had about 450 titles in its catalog, versus about 2,500 from its main competitor Books on Tape (BoT), but that Recorded Books focused more on the quality of its sound recordings than BoT did. Six years later in a 1995 article, it was reported Recorded Books had produced 1,600 books. In 2004, it was reported that of Recorded Books' 800 new unabridged titles per year, 650 are released to libraries/schools/mail order/rental. Fifty of those 650 titles are made available for the retail sales market. Of the 800 new titles, 150 titles are sold only into the U.K. market. First quarter 2004 had more than $16 million in net sales. In January 2014, a press release said Recorded Books had over 13,500 audiobook titles. In January 2015, after the acquisition of Tantor Media, Recorded Books a catalog of more than 22,000 titles. In August 2015, after the acquisition by Shamrock Advisors, the company reported publishing 3,000 new books annually with catalog of 25,000 titles.

It is the seat for the Archeparchy of Philadelphia. History Ruthenians, are Catholics who belong to and follow the prayer life of the Byzantine Church and were known as such in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, started immigrating in sizable numbers to the United States in the late 1870s. A Ruthenian priest immigrated in 1884 and blessed their first church building in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania. The earliest immigrants to Philadelphia settled in Northern Liberties between Sixth and Seventh Streets, south of Girard Avenue. They founded Immaculate Conception parish in 1886. In 1964, as plans were being made to replace the 1907 cathedral, several members of the congregation wanted the new church to be built in the suburbs where they lived. Archbishop Ambrose Senyshyn chose to build on the property where the old church stood hoping that the East Poplar Redevelopment Area would rejuvenate the neighborhood. The cornerstone was laid on October 16, 1966 and it contains a stone from St. Peter's tomb that Pope Paul VI gave to Archbishop Senyshyn. Pope John Paul II visited the cathedral on October 4, 1979. Architecture The cathedral was designed by Julian K. Jastremsky in the Byzantine Revival style and loosely inspired by the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The cathedral's central dome is covered with 1/4 inch square Venetian glass tiles made of 22 karat gold fused in the glass. The dome's interior features a mosaic of the Pantocrator. At the base of the dome there are 32 windows. They depict the coat of arms of the regions of Ukraine, the popes, the bishops and the religious orders that contributed to the growth of the Ukrainian Catholic church in the United States. The mosaic on the sanctuary wall features the Theotokos. Below the Mother of God is a mosaic of the Last Supper. To the right of that mosaic is one depicting the Emmaus from the Gospel of Luke, to the left is a mosaic of the Visitation of the Holy Trinity from the Book of Genesis. The stained glass windows in the sanctuary portray 12 six-winged angels as described in the Book of Isaiah. The Iconostas was designed by Chrystyna Dochwat. In the middle are the Royal Doors on which there is a depiction of the Annunciation and icons of the Four Evangelists. To the right of the Royal Doors features the icons of Christ the Teacher, St. Stephen the First-Martyr (on the deacon door), and St. John the Baptist. To the left of the Royal Doors portrays icons depicting the Mother of God with the infant Jesus, St. Michael the Archangel (on the deacon door) and St. Nicholas the Wonderworker. Above the Royal Doors is the icon of the Last Supper. At the top of the Iconostas is a depiction of the crucifixion and an icon of Christ the King.

Born in La Plata, she started and dropped studies of Journalism. She fell in love with a man, and developed anorexia and bulimia in her attempts to improve her physical image. She was the webmaster of a page that encouraged girls to stop eating. She attempted to commit suicide when her boyfriend left her, but was stopped, and started a treatment to be cured of her bulimia and anorexia. She told her story at , and got a new boyfriend. This gave her the idea to write a book about her eating disorders, her rocky relation with her old boyfriend, and her attempted suicide.  Reception  The book was a big success, and Latini was interviewed at several TV and radio programs about it, including Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand. She then started tours to present the book in other Latin American countries. The film renewed the interest in the book. The book received mixed reviews, as some reviewers considered it an intelligent treatment of eating disorders, while others thought that it made an apology of anorexia instead. Latini pointed that she is well aware that anorexia is an eating disorder.  Adaptations  The book has been adapted by an eponymous film, starring María Eugenia Suárez. The film was made a decade after the release of the book, and Latini was not involved with the production. She praised the work of actresses Suárez and Gloria Carrá, and director Daniela Goggi. She pointed that the film is more focused on the love story, while the book has more detail about the eating disorders.

They all come from different countries that share borders that their population members choose to cross only rarely and unwillingly. They speak different languages, but can excellently understand each other.\\"Samo kažem\\"- prva regionalna veb serija za tinejdžere, Blic, November 3, 2013 Characters According to official website characters are described as following: Jovana (17) is the youngest one in the gang. She is deeply convinced that she is quite maturer than her peers. Until now, she was an ordinary high school student from Belgrade, Serbia. But this summer, while her boyfriend is on a trip to Canada, her universe is about to change entirely. Miloš (21) is a Belgrade bum. He spends hours watching YouTube, and is the author of some of videos there. The most important things in his life are good fun and surf. The rest is too demanding for anyone to take it seriously. This drives his younger sister Jovana up the wall. Maja (19) is her daddy's little girl. She fled from Kotor, Montenegro, from her father and from the small community there, to live in Belgrade and be an independent woman. Her daddy still pays all her bills, rents a huge apartment in downtown Belgrade for her and regularly sends her a mind-bogglingly huge allowance. Always in a good mode, smiling, laughing and optimistic, Aleksandra (19) is a true party girl. She dreams of becoming an actress, moving from Skoplje, Macedonia, to Hollywood, and especially of leaving her hand imprints on the Walk of Fame in a dashing dress! If life gives you lemons, make a lemonade. Zoran (21) has not exactly been given any lemons, but has his father's taxi cab and his own ambition to buy a brand new iPhone. Prices of bear in Belgrade, Serbia, stand in the way of this achievement. And, in addition to this – he can't exactly tell where he belongs. Dren (20) is the quiet character in this gang, mainly due to the fact that he can't speak their language. He followed his love and ventured out to a great adventure, and for the first time in his life, he came to the city that he heard nothing but the worst things about. True challenges lie ahead for him, along with some interesting revelations as well. Milena (21) is a romantic, well-wishing soul. She moved from the little town of Kuršumlija to Belgrade, exchanging the safety of the small community and her parents’ home for the life in a big city that is not always cosy for its inhabitants. She works as a nurse, and is now for a couple of months volunteering in a hospital. Her preferences are those of the young people in general. She's into horoscopes. Relaxed and always smiling, Marko (21) is the good genie of the gang. He lives in the small town of Bor, and loves traveling more than anything else in this world. He packs his things with the same passion for a trip to Lausanne, Switzerland and to Loznica, Serbia, as long as he is about to travel to a place. He works as an attendant in the renting booth for paddleboats on Srebrno Jezero to earn his pocket money. Like many others, Zoran's father, Dušan (51), had to leave his birthplace during the wars in 1990s. He moved from Sarajevo to Belgrade and he changed many jobs to support his family – he worked as a dealer of various goods in the open market, as a night security guard, as a service engineer for household appliances... As soon as he saved enough money, he bought a car and started working as a taxi driver. He is divorced. He misses his son a great deal because he can see him in the summer only – Zoran spends the rest of the year with his mother in Sarajevo. Production Cast of the #JustSaying series was selected over a period of several months in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo. In the very beginning, the creative team decided that the cast should consist of young actors and not of the non- professional actors, which was among their ideas and options initially. This is the first significant project professionally for most of the people involved in the production of this series – from the very young actors to the director, Ms. Jelena Gavrilović, a senior undergraduate of Film Directing at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade. The series' supervisors were some of the key creative authors of the modern Serbian scene, including Boris Miljković, Đorđe Marković and Kosta Glušica, whose valuable experiences were used to direct the creative process. At the same time, they enjoyed the creative expression of the new generation of authors, and enabled them to create their own language and communicate their wishes, fears, aspirations and their reality to us. The series was filmed on numerous locations in Belgrade, and in Sarajevo, Kotor, Prizren, Novi Sad, Ada Bojana and Srebrno Jezero as well. Promotion Popular Social networks' pages of #JustSaying series on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SoundCloud and Instagram provide an opportunity for the viewers to connect and communicate with the people involved in creation of the series and with other fans. Each character in the series has their own profile page on Facebook, Twitter and Instragram networks, which are used to gradually reveal information about the characters – their musical, cinematographic and reading preferences and choices and things that make them happy. Through their interactions on the social networks' sites, the characters are becoming three-dimensional, richer and closer to the audience. Other than among themselves, the characters are also communicating with their audiences on the social networks' sites, providing the audience members with opportunities and channels to supply comments, like and share the posts that the #JustSaying characters are publishing for their online community on a daily basis. Music Thrilling soundtrack of the series ranges from the music by Voodoo Popeye to that produced by the Stray Dogg, from Vlado Georgijev's songs to Prti Bee Gee. Descriptions of each webisode contain titles of songs used in the series, and almost all the music used is available for listening on the official SoundCloud channel of the series.Balkanska Internet sapunica zabranjena za starije od 21 , 24 sata, November 7, 2013 Critical reception During the initial 40 days of distribution, when the first ten webisodes were broadcast, the YouTube channel counted more than 150.000 views, and its Facebook page got almost 10,000 likes.

Organisational history Third Carlist War It was founded by the Carlist politician and thinker Cándido Nocedal; the first issue came out on March 19, 1875. As the Carlists suffered a crushing defeat in the Third Carlist War, the initiative was supposed to shift focus to the long-term perspective of the literary war. The new newspaper was to disseminate the Carlist thought using the highest analytical and erudite standards. Following the death of its founder in 1885, the newspaper was taken over by his son, Ramón Nocedal. In 1889 El Siglo Futuro departed from the mainstream Traditionalism as Nocedal and his followers set up Partido Católico Nacional, a breakaway group usually referred to as the Integrists. After the death of Nocedal in 1907 the newspaper was inherited by his successor at the helm of the group, Juan Olazábal, while Manuel Senante became the editor-in-chief. In 1932, as the Integrists re-united with the mainstream Carlism, the daily followed suit. In 1935 it was fully incorporated into the Carlist propaganda machinery. Following the outbreak of the Civil War it was last issued on July 18, 1936; soon afterwards its premises were ransacked by the anarchists. Key threads El Siglo Futuro. 1892 The principal objective of El Siglo Futuro remained the defence of Catholic faith and position of the Church in Spain. Ultraconservative, its primary foe was liberalism, later to be paired with - viewed as more radical but somewhat lesser evils - democracy and socialism. The paper propagated the theories of Leo XIII and his successors, advocating a new social and political vision of a modern Catholic state. The daily remained strongly monarchical, though with less clear dynastical allegiances. Disseminated what it perceived traditional Spanish values. In the 20th century the paper led the venomous campaign against the Jews and the freemasonry, claiming that Judaism is the head and the Freemasonry is the arms of the satanic monster; the Jews were alternately accused of alliance with the Russian Bolshevism or with the capitalist plutocracy. In 1930s El Siglo was a fairly typical Spanish party paper, excelling in bombastic, hyperbolical, inflammatory, intransigent, sectarian phraseology – very much like the republican or socialist press, let alone the anarchist or communist papers. The official Spanish digital archive describes the late daily as fanatically fundamentalist, consumed by apocalyptic obsession and dubbed a caveman. Contemporary issues El Siglo Futuro pronounced on every issue faced by Spain of its time. It fought the Alfonsist reinstatement, opposed militantly secular liberalism of the late Restauración era, sided with the Conservative Party against the modernizing designs of late 19th century, followed the 1898 disaster in the war against the United States, cautiously endorsed Catalan and Basque rights if framed in the traditional fueros, sympathized with the Central Powers in course of the First World War, despised the emerging anarchist and Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, cheered the Primo de Rivera dictatorship to be disillusioned later, had few regrets about the fallen monarchy of Alfonso XIII but was almost explicitly hostile towards the Republic, welcomed the rise of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, to turn against the latter following the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss. El Siglo Futuro Executive Board. 1925 Continuity and change Throughout its lifetime El Siglo Futuro remained an ultraconservative, vehemently antiliberal and then fiercely antidemocratic vehicle of pursuing traditional values centered on the Catholic faith. The competitive position of the newspaper remained fairly stable, trailing far behind the mainstream dailies. On the Spanish national press market of the 20th century it maintained a circulation of 5,000, compared to 200,000 of the monarchist ABC or 80,000 of the Christian El Debate in the late 1930s. The readership base remained mostly the same, composed of parish clergy and Traditionalist activists. The layout and design evolved. Initially it was composed of six pages seven columns each. Over the years, editorial segment was expanded with economic, sports and culture sections added. In 1920s El Siglo Futuro started to include photography and cartoons, to change the design dramatically in 1935 and increasing to 32 pages. El Siglo Futuro vs other Carlist dailies the Carlist standard There were many Traditionalist newspapers issued all over Spain throughout late 19th and early 20th century, though most of them short-lived and local. It is estimated that during the 1930s out of ca 300 dailies published across the country around 10% were Carlist, though only few gained some prominence. Compared to them, El Siglo Futuro was almost equaled in terms of circulation by the Barcelona-based El Correo Catalán of Miguel Junyent and the Sevilla- based La Unión of Domingo Tejera, trailed by the smaller Pamplona-based El Pensamiento Navarro and the Vitoria-based El Pensamiento Álaves, both ca 3,000-4,000 copies each. Dynastical issues usually remained of lesser importance to El Siglo Futuro. The paper presented a somewhat broader perspective, dedicating more space to foreign affairs; other Carlist titles remained focused mostly on the national, if not purely regional issues. It was not attached to the traditional, Navarrese leadership of the Carlist movement and was the first to hail Manuel Fal Conde as the new head. El Siglo Futuro was definitely less news-dependent, with editorials remaining frequent pieces. Finally, the geographical coverage and the readers’ base was visibly broader; as a Madrid daily it was reaching national decision-makers with more ease. In terms of prestige within the Carlist community only El Pensamiento Navarro could have compared to El Siglo Futuro. Last years Following the merger with mainstream Carlism in 1932 the paper became a semi-official organ of Comunión Tradicionalista. Its ownership passed from the Olazábal circle to the Editorial Tradicionalista company (headed by Conde Rodezno), which was in turn controlled by the Delegación Especial de Prensa (headed by Manuel González Quevedo). In 1935 Senante lost his overwhelming influence on the paper line; thanks to the party funds El Siglo Futuro was dramatically enhanced, but at a price of forming part of the centralised and modernised Carlist press system. The daily had to follow strict discipline, publishing official material and giving approved treatment to most public issues. If El Siglo Futuro retained its Integrist core it was only because the ex-Integrist Manuel Fal Conde was heading the Carlist movement at that time. In fact, El Siglo Futuro was one of the principal means allowing the ex-Integrists to occupy central position in the Carlist movement. The end Upon the outbreak of the Civil War the Madrid premises of the newspaper were ransacked and taken over by the anarchist militiamen. During the war the title was not re-created elsewhere in the Nationalist zone. Afterwards Senante was allegedly considering resuming his opus magnum, but afraid that it would be incorporated into the francoist propaganda machine he hesitated until finally abandoning the idea.

Statistical Service of Republic of Cyprus) but there is no parish church of that name. At the last Census (2011) it had a population of 5,767, an increase from a population of 5,185 in 2001. It covers an area in the south-western part of the municipal area of Nicosia, within and without the walls.Municipality/Community, Quarter and Street Index published by Ministry of Information (CILIS_streets_022011) The population in 1946 was 3,012,Census of Cyprus, 1946 consisting of 2,224 Greek Cypriots, 152 Turkish Cypriots and 636 others. History Tophane/Ayios Andreas is one of the 24 historic Neighbourhoods of Nicosia within the walls. In 1923 it was extended to encompass an area outside the walls.Order No. 397 published in Cyprus Gazette No. 1597, 4 August 1923 The northern boundary (with Arab Ahmet Quarter) ran west from the opening in the walls by Paphos Gate, along the Bridge Road, across the Pediaios Potamos Bridge and along the Central Prison Road until it met the municipal boundary (Subsequent adjustment placed the northern boundary slightly north of this.\\"Quarters of Nicosia\\" Prepared and published by the Dept. of Lands and Surveys, Cyprus, 1985, Revised 1997. Series DLS30. Scale 1:7500). The southern boundary with Trypiotis Quarter, outside the walls, ran from salient of the Tripoli bastion to the circular road (Stassinou St.), thence north west to the square between the Cyprus Museum and the Nicosia General Hospital (Homer Ave./Byron St. junction), then followed the old Strovolos Road (now Gladstone St.) until it reached the river Pediaios and the municipal boundary. The present boundary is broadly similar (see recent Department of Lands and Surveys map of the Nicosia Quarters). Tophane was a prestigious neighbourhood, where Turkish, Greek and Armenian Cypriots used to coexist together with the Latins. Tophane means literally in Turkish the cannon’s house or the store for artillery ammunition, which is sited in the Neighbourhood. In September 1945, the Ottoman name of the Tophane Neighbourhood was changed into Ayios Andreas. No Turkish Cypriot was living in this neighbourhood after 1960 and the last Turkish name, that of Tophane Mesdjidi Street, where mainly resided Turkish Cypriots, was changed into Granikou Street after 1963. The Nicosia Old General Hospital was built in 1935 in Chilonos St. near the bridge over the Pediaios, but this was demolished in 2010.\\"British Colonial Architecture in Cyprus\\", by Costas Georghiou, pub Nicosia 2013 A new general hospital was built in the Strovolos industrial area. Tophane or Armaments Store House, near Paphos Gate, Nicosia Landmarks=Tophane or Castelliotissa= The medieval building now known as Castelliotissa, which is near Paphos Gate, was originally a part of the second Royal Palace of the Lusignan royal dynasty of Cyprus. It was later used as a munitions store by the Ottomans and received the name Tophane, which means literally in Turkish the cannon’s house or the store for artillery ammunition. This establishment gave its name to the Neighbourhood. It continued as a store in the British period, including petrol storage. =Paphos Gate= On the west side of the city the gate of St. Domenico (now the Paphos Gate) probably occupies the position of the medieval gate of the same name. It formerly adjoined the famous monastery and royal chateau of St. Domenico, the creation of King James I of Cyprus at the end of the 14th century, of which not a vestige now remains. This gate was closed by the British when they made the new opening at the side through the ramparts in 1878.\\"A Description of the Historic Monuments of Cyprus\\" by George Jeffery, Architect .Publ.

The Vicar- General's house was in no sense a public building and dated from 1897. At the side of this house was a small convent of French \\"Sisters of St. Joseph\\" with a school attached. This was also considered as a private house and has but later adapted to the use of a community. On 20 October 1959 the foundation stone of a new Maronite church was laid and services began on 1 November 1961. The church is sited in Favierou St., now renamed St. Maron St., near Paphos Gate. Its architectural style has been described as modern with some classical elements. It is near the Roman Catholic church of the Holy Cross, close to Paphos Gate, which is in Karamanzade Neighbourhood.\\"Nicosia Capital of Cyprus Then and Now\\" (Greek edition), by Kevork Keshishian, pub Nicosia 1989. pp 164-170 Tophane Mesjid =Tophane Mesjid= The mosque of Tophane Mesjid, now disused, is in Granikou St.(former Tophane Mesjid St) at the corner of St. Maron St . =CYTA headquarters= CYTA (Cyprus Telecommunications Authority) for many years had its headquarters at Electra House, a tall office block topped with a radio tower just outside Paphos Gate, in Egypt St.\\"Nicosia Capital of Cyprus Then and Now\\" (Greek edition), by Kevork Keshishian, pub Nicosia 1989. pp 292 Nicosia Municipal Gardens =Municipal gardens= The Nicosia municipal gardens were established outside of Paphos Gate on the site of the former Tannery, which was relocated in the 1880s.

Balanos of the Archaeological Society of Athens and construction was supervised by George H. Everett Jeffery then curator of the museum. The portico is unusually for that period built in a classical style As an institution, the Cyprus Museum was founded in 1882, following a petition which was delivered to the British administration by a delegation headed by the religious leaders of both the Christian and Muslim populations. A major catalyst for this action were several illicit excavations and the smuggling of antiquities off the island. The most extensive of these had been carried out a few years earlier by the United States Consul, Luigi Palma di Cesnola, who had smuggled over 35,000 artefacts off the island, most of which were destroyed in transit. Many of the surviving items ended up in the newly formed Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and are currently on display in their own galleries on the second floor. The initial museum was funded by private donations and was temporarily housed in existing governmental offices. It moved to its own premises in 1889 on Victoria Street within the medieval walls of the city and then to the current building shortly after 1908. Soon after its inception, the museum started receiving items from the numerous excavations on the island, mainly run by British and European expeditions. Indicative are the annual excavation reports published in The Journal of Hellenic Studies from 1890 onwards. The first organised catalogue was soon compiled and published in 1899 by Sir John Myres and Max Ohnefalsch- Richter. The collections of the museum were greatly augmented by the first large scale systematic excavations carried out by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition between 1927 and 1931 under the direction of professor Einar Gjerstad. In 1961 a second set of galleries, storerooms and offices was completed. =Law courts= Nicosia Law Courts The Nicosia District Court and Supreme Court of Cyprus have been established at the former Wolseley Barracks north of the Municipal Gardens. It was originally built as an English Girls School. Before independence the Law Courts were in the Law Courts building built in 1904 on the north side of Serai Square. The Nicosia Courts buildings were originally built as an English School. The ownership of the school was eventually transferred to the War Office and the buildings were called Wolseley Barracks.\\"Nicosia Capital of Cyprus Then and Now\\" (Greek edition), by Kevork Keshishian, pub Nicosia 1990. p. 216 Rev. F.D. Newham founded the English School, under the control and support of the British administration in 1900. George Jeffery designed a building complex, which was later called the Wolseley Barracks. The general outline of the original design consisted of three blocks, arranged symmetrically, surrounding a courtyard where the entrance was provided by a small, but rusticated guardhouse. The wide arch of the entrance gate recalls the Girls' Schools' arcade. The lower, covered passageways gave access to the connection between the two-floor blocks. The central block with a pitched roof had a lantern above the entrance, strengthened by a projected gate, by a rusticated arch and a terrace surrounded by a balustrade over the entrance. Classrooms were arranged on the corridors, as to be oriented inwards, towards the inner courtyard. Jeffery's design followed a simplified Neo-Classical style amalgamated with colonial architecture. Pilasters with Doric capitals on the ground floor the wide arch, yellow sandstone, rustication at the ground floor, passageways enriched with pointed arches, the wooden Iattice girders peculiar to the Cypriot colonial architecture and quoin at comer were among the architectural details.\\"From the Ottoman Province to the Colony: Late Ottoman Educational Buildings In Nicosia\\", by Burcu Ozguven, pub 2004 =Ayios Andreas Elementary School= This is sited in that part of the neighbourhood west of the river Pediaios, in St. Paul Street.

Faber & Faber) Garden, Ashes () is a 1965 novel by Yugoslav author Danilo Kiš. Garden, Ashes is based on Kiš's childhood. An English translation, by William J. Hannaher, was published in 1975 by Harcourt. Content The narrative is told from the perspective of a young boy, Andi Scham, who at the beginning of the novel resides in Novi Sad in Yugoslavia. His absent father, Eduard Schamm, is an eccentric and meticulous railway inspector and a writer whose unfinished work is the third edition of a travel guide called Bus, Ship, Rail and Air Travel Guide – the updated edition, which Scham will never complete, is to be encyclopedic in its scope. After being shot at by gendarme soldiers, Eduard relocates his family to Hungary where Andi enters primary school. Later Eduard is sent to a ghetto and is then deported to Auschwitz, never to return to his family. Eduard presumably dies in the camps, though Andi insists that his father has merely disappeared. The narrative structure becomes more fractured after Eduard's departure. Andi imagines that his father is following him in disguise and invents stories about his parents' first meeting. Andi acknowledges that \\"ever since my father vanished from the story, from the novel, everything has come loose, fallen apart.\\" In the final scene of the novel, Andi wanders through the same woods that were the setting for an earlier imagined encounter in which Eduard was accused of being an Allied spy. He claims that his father's \\"ghost\\" haunts those woods. Andi's mother encourages him to leave as it is getting dark. Andi is incredibly imaginative, to a fault. He is plagued by recurring nightmares and is haunted by illusions of his father. Only toward the end of the novel, as he starts to read adventure novels, does he begin to constrain his imagination. Style The novel is structured as a \\"loosely connected chronological sequence of half-explained adventures\\". Most of the focus is on the father, and what happens to the mother and child, living with difficulty in impoverished circumstances, is only partially explained. Refusing to give any moral judgment of the father, Kiš portrays him as a complex character, \\"enigmatic and half-crazed..., a man with an eloquent tongue and a fanciful mind who frequently abandoned family, sobriety, and reason\\", according to Murlin Croucher. Though Andi is a child, his narratorial voice is remarkably mature. Mark Thompson describes Andi as a \\"hybrid narrator who blends the expressive power of an accomplished artist with the limited understanding-- but the unlimited imagination, or intuition-- of a young person.\\" Autobiographical elements Kiš openly acknowledged that the Scham family was based on his own family. “I am convinced that it is me, that it’s my father, my mother, my sister,” Kiš said in an interview on Garden, Ashes. Eduard Scham resembles Kiš's own father (also named Eduard) in his appearance, eccentric personality, and career as a railway inspector-cum-travel guide author. The events of the novel closely follow Kiš's actual life during World War II. Like his fictional counterpart, Eduard Kiš narrowly escaped a shooting death by gendarme officers in Novi Sad, then relocated his family to Hungary. Also like Scham, Eduard Kiš was confined to a ghetto and later sent to Auschwitz. As Andi does in the novel, Kiš himself would insist that his father had not died in the camps but had merely \\"disappeared.\\" Themes and symbols=Singer sewing machine= A recurring symbol in the novel is Andi's mother's Singer sewing machine. Kiš describes the machine in detail and includes a sketch of the machine, so as to convey not only that Andi's mother uses the machine to create beauty but that the machine itself is beautiful. This beauty symbolizes home or the ability to feel at home. When the Schams flee to Hungary, the sewing machine is lost \\"in the confusion of war.\\" This loss symbolizes how the war destroys Andi's home. =Death= Upon hearing that his uncle has died, Andi begins to dwell obsessively on his own mortality. This realization can be seen as Andi's first step toward self-analysis. Andi becomes determined to outwit death by catching \\"the angel of sleep.\\" Though he is not successful in this endeavor, Andi's struggle with his own mortality reveals the character's sensitive nature and makes clear that Kiš does not idolize childhood innocence. =Dreams= Andi is plagued with nightmares throughout the novel. Intrusive thoughts about his own mortality often keep Andi from sleeping, and when he does fall asleep he is restless and plagued by nightmares. Andi has recurring dreams of conquering the \\"angel of death.\\" These dreams are so terrifying that when he wakes up his first thoughts are \\"akin to mortal fear.\\" Andi only overcomes these dreams when in his dreams he declares \\"I AM DREAMING,\\" which subdues the angel. He then begins to channel his \\"darkest impulses\\" into his dreams, eating the poppyseed cakes that are denied him in his real life or pursuing a village woman with whom he is fascinated. Žarko Martinović argues that Andi's nightmares are best classified as traumatic dreams. Sufferers of posttraumatic stress disorder often experience these types of dreams. Andi suppresses his nightmares by lucid dreaming. Kiš wrote Garden, Ashes long before lucid dreaming became a well- researched field of study. Origins of the title The novel's title possibly derives from an accusation made by the Hungarian fascists against the father: (falsely) accused of being an Allied spy, an accusation the son wants to believe since it increases his father's heroic status, he is said to direct the Allied planes to deliver the bombs that turn \\"everything into dust and ashes\\". More generally, the Holocaust transforms objects of beauty (\\"gardens\\") into ashes. Publication and reception Kiš described Garden, Ashes as part of his “family cycle” trilogy, consisting of Early Sorrows (1970), Garden, Ashes, and The Hourglass (1972). Garden, Ashes contains many scenes also present in Early Sorrows, including Andi's relationship with Julia Szabo, Eduard's departure, and the pogrom scene. Kiš wrote Garden, Ashes while employed as a lector at the University of Strasbourg. Compared to his earlier novels, Kiš found Garden, Ashes much more difficult to write. The novel \\"was greeted by the critics as a significant work by a promising young writer\\". By the time it was translated and published in English, it had already appeared in French, German, Polish, and Hungarian. English reviews were mixed but mostly positive. Murlin Croucher praised the \\"rich yet youthful and slightly hyperbolic style\\", though he felt that the book lacked an overall purpose. Croucher also remarked on the impossibility of distinguishing between fact and fiction, which became a hallmark of Kiš's work. Vasa Mihailovich comments on the novel's charm, which he says was unsurpassed even by Kiš's later \\"more sophisticated and mature books\\". Critical analysis=As a work of Holocaust literature= Many critics have examined the novel as a work of Holocaust literature. Like other authors who were young children during the Holocaust, Kiš uses literature to confront childhood traumas. Garden, Ashes is unusual in that while it is ostensibly about the Holocaust, since Eduard dies in Auschwitz, Kiš makes few explicit references to the Holocaust. Aleksander Stević argues that Kiš chooses to have Andi suppress memories of the Holocaust so as to give Eduard autonomy. Andi imagines that his father is being persecuted for being a raving genius, rather than for being a Jew. For example, Andi describes his family's move to the suburbs following a pogrom as \\"guided by my father's star.\\" Though the star in question is clearly the Star of David, Andi later refers to this star as \\"the star of his destiny,\\" making the star into a symbol of his father's travels. With this choice, Kiš humanizes his father, who was stripped of his identity by the Holocaust. =Comparisons to Fatelessness= Garden, Ashes is often compared to Fatelessness, a 1975 semi-autobiographical novel by Hungarian author Imre Kertész. Mark Thompson describes Fatelessness as the \\"sequel or sibling\\" of Garden, Ashes. György, the protagonist of Fatelessness, bears resemblance to Andi in that his innocence blinds him to what is going on around him. György continually tries to normalize and reconcile what he has seen in the camps, as a way of coping with horrific events, much like how Andi suppresses images of the war. Both Kertész and Kiš attempt to humanize victims of the Holocaust. When asked by reporters if the camps are as horrific as they've heard, György claims that at times he was \\"happy\\" in the camps, a form of resistance against a regime that wants to strip him of his emotional autonomy. This is similar to how in Garden, Ashes in how Andi continually portrays his father as an exceptional genius who is persecuted not for religion but for his genius. Fatelessness and Garden, Ashes were published at a time when discussion on the Holocaust were discouraged by the Hungarian and Yugoslav governments. The novels are credited for inciting discourse on the Holocaust in these countries.

It originally aired on January 9, 2014 on NBC; and was written by Erik Sommers and directed by Tristram Shapeero. In this episode, a prankster dubbed the Ass Crack Bandit wreaks havoc on the students and faculty of Greendale. This leads Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and Annie Edison (Alison Brie) to further investigate the situation; the episode then shifts in tone after Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown) reveals shocking news to Jeff, Annie, and the study group. This prankster was first referenced in the second season episode \\"Intro to Political Science,\\" when Annie states \\"the assailant known only as the 'Ass Crack Bandit' will be brought to justice.\\" The episode received critical acclaim, with most critics commenting positively on Donald Glover's comical role as a traumatized Troy Barnes after becoming a victim to the Bandit, while others commented positively on the revelation of Pierce Hawthorne's (Chevy Chase) fate; the episode also saw a rise in ratings from the episodes \\"Repilot\\" and \\"Introduction to Teaching,\\" with a total audience of 3.58 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 1.4. Plot When the \\"Ass Crack Bandit\\" (whose M.O. is to drop a coin down the back of someone's pants when they lean over) returns to campus, Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and Annie Edison (Alison Brie) begin an investigation. Professor Ian Duncan (John Oliver) also helps. Soon, Troy Barnes (Donald Glover) becomes a victim of the Bandit, and Annie is able to deduce from past \\"attacks\\" that a teacher is the most likely culprit. Jeff and Annie are able to track a phone call made by the bandit to the Greendale stables, where they discover former student Alex \\"Star-Burns\\" Osbourne (Dino Stamatopoulos). Star-Burns had been living at the stables after faking his own death, and is presumed to be the bandit, even going so far as confessing under pressure. However, during a dance in commemoration of Star-Burns' capture, Star-Burns admits to Jeff that he falsely confessed as part of a bargain with Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) to get a heating unit for the stables. Annie comes to suspect Professor Duncan may be the \\"Ass Crack Bandit\\", however this is proven untrue when he becomes a victim himself. Before the investigation can go any further, Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown) arrives and informs the group that former member Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase) has died. The group grieves, the investigation for the Ass Crack Bandit is called off, and Star-Burns recants his former confession; it is hinted at the episode's end that several of the show's main and supporting cast members may be the Ass Crack Bandit. Production This episode marks the return of John Oliver as Professor Ian Duncan, who was last seen in the second season. Dino Stamatopoulos also returns to the series as Alex \\"Star-Burns\\" Osbourne, having been last seen in the third-season finale. Musician Ben Folds wrote and performed an original song, \\"Ass Crack Bandit\\" for the episode's climax, with backing vocals by Ruby Amanfu. A 4-minute version of the song was hinted at by Folds on Twitter, and then posted on YouTube a month after the episode aired. Folds also appears in a cameo role in the episode, as a botany professor. Cultural references The episode adheres to tropes of the crime drama genre, e.g., TV series like The Bridge, Hannibal, and The Killing. Abed also references crime shows that feature lead characters with mild mental disorders (such as The Bridge and Hannibal), and is later seen deleting said shows from his DVR. The episode is specifically stylized after crime films such as David Fincher's Seven and Zodiac, as well as Red Dragon. Shirley's sons sing the Radiohead song \\"Creep\\" in the opening scene in the style of the initial trailer for Fincher's The Social Network. Reception=Ratings= The episode was watched by 3.58 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.4/4. This presents a rise in viewers and ratings from the season premiere, which was watched by 3.49 million viewers and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.3/4. The show placed second in its timeslot behind The Big Bang Theory, and seventh for the night. =Critical reception= The episode was received positively by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signaling highly positive reviews, saying \\"Season 5’s first focused “parody” episode was a standout installment of Community. The Seven homages were terrific and hysterical and this will likely be one of the most quoted Community episodes ever among fans, with one awesome line after another. In fact, it was difficult stopping this review from simply naming one highlight after another. While the focus was on Annie and Jeff, this episode also managed to give pretty much every character at least one great line or moment, including Shirley's \\"He should be the run on sentence Bandit\\", Abed's \\"Mildly autistic super detectives everywhere!\\" run, Chang's backwards butt costume and Britta naming every possible meaning for the Ass Crack Bandit's crimes.\\"\\" He also called Jeff and Annie's storyline in this episode \\"one of the best uses of this show’s “Will they or won’t they?” dynamic yet.\\" Also, in regard to the episode's ending with the revelation of Pierce's death, Goldman said \\"The news of Pierce’s death in the midst of all this was certainly a shock and a bit of a jolt to the system, given the episode was in such a specific zone up until then. That was the point, of course – and Neil’s somber eulogy, followed by “Up next on the dial is Dr. Farts” was hysterical.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix noted Pierce's death, saying \\"I'm glad Harmon and Chase were able to work out one final appearance for him before bumping off Pierce, and introducing his death here lent some gravity to all the silliness between Jeff, Annie and the Ass Crack Bandit, whomever he or she may be.\\" Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode's use of the parody, saying \\"the episode was a committed (and thoroughly hilarious) genre parody of David Fincher-style suspense thrillers. And it went full-on macro, venturing into new and unknown regions of the Greendale universe, turning the community college into a Springfield of its own. Not that I don’t like those bottle-episodey group therapy sessions where the only things that are explored are feelings and emotions — those are also great, but these are a little greater if you ask me.\\" Britt Hayes of ScreenCrush gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"Of everything in tonight’s episode, Troy might be my favorite, and maybe I'm a bit partial to Donald Glover since he’s leaving us pretty soon, but his Ass Crack Bandit victim with PTSD schtick was beautifully dramatized with a great payoff.\\" She also noted the episode's ending, saying: > \\"the way this week’s episode builds to its Fincheresque climax — with Annie > and Jeff on the cusp of solving the crime during a big student gathering, a > couple of clever misdirects, and then the pair losing their bad guy at the > last minute — only to slide gracefully into Shirley announcing the death of > Pierce was quite moving. It really highlights the way that this group exists > in their own little Greendale microcosm filled with adventures (like these > theme episodes) that distract them from the realities of everyday life, like > old friends passing away. While they were busy trying to find a prankster > who likes to shove quarters down butt cracks, their friend was off somewhere > taking his last breath. Amid all the clever gags and moments of laughter, > this show still finds time to have a huge, beating heart in the center of it > all, and Dan Harmon balances it all so, so well.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"I was impressed with a lot of it while never quite embracing it as fully as I might have. It’s weird, but after the one-two punch of the one-hour premiere (and after seeing next week’s episode), a little part of me was momentarily irritated by seeing a concept episode, particularly when such a thing used to be one of my favorite reasons to watch the show. The episode quickly won it over—again, it said “butts” a lot—but I found myself kind of wanting more “normal Greendale” adventures going in, and that may have affected my opinion a bit in the early going.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com gave the episode a more mixed review, saying the episode \\"was a pretty good Community spoof, but it lacked a character story to anchor it to the rest of the season, in contrast to other Community parody episodes like 'Pillows & Blankets,' 'Critical Film Studies,' and 'Contemporary American Poultry.' Don't get me wrong, I loved the episode and I wish I could British high-five it, but it's my job to raise discussion points.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Basic Intergluteal Numismatics\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Community (season 5) episodes ","title":"Basic Intergluteal Numismatics"},{"id":"41599740","text":"Charlemagne Émile de Maupas (8 December 1818 – 19 June 1888) was a French lawyer and politician who was head of the Parisian Police during the critical period when Napoleon III seized power in the coup of 2 December 1851. Early years Charlemagne Émile de Maupas was born in Bar-sur-Aube, Aube, on 8 December 1818. He studied law in Paris. He entered the prefectural career as a sub-prefect of Uzès in 1845, then of Beaune in 1847. He returned to private life after the February Revolution of 1848. He attached himself to the Bonapartist party, and soon gained the confidence of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. De Maupas was named in succession sub-prefect of Boulogne-sur-Mer (1849), prefect of Allier (1849) and prefect of Haute-Garonne (1850). He was noted for his zeal and lack of scruples. When prefect of Haute-Garonne he wanted to arrest enemies of the regime. The magistrate protested that there was no evidence. He replied that evidence would be created. December 1851 coup Lithograph of Charlemagne de Maupas On 27 October 1851 Louis Napoleon appointed de Maupas to police headquarters in Paris. He replaced Carlier as head of the prefecture of the police. He was one of the leaders of the 2 December 1851 coup, along with Charles de Morny and Saint Arnaud. He disagreed with the tactic of letting the riots start before annihilating them. His preferred approach would have been to deploy the army in force in Paris to deter any attempt at resistance. Although there were risks of the troops fraternizing with the insurgents, his approach would have avoided bloodshed. In his first proclamation he warned the people of Paris not to resist in face of inflexible force, and that night arrested all who seemed most hostile to the coup. Later career After the coup de Maupas was placed at the head of the Police Ministry, established on 22 January 1852. He took vigorous measures to arrest opponents of the regime, including several publicists whom he had deported to Africa. He extended the jurisdiction of the Police Commisariat to cover all towns in France. He used agents provocateurs freely, and was merciless in his treatment of opponents, particularly the press. Eventually Napoleon III decided de Maupas was being excessively harsh. There was also mounting opposition from the Ministries of the Interior and War, which saw their authority being undermined. The Ministry of Police was suppressed on 10 June 1853. On 21 June 1853 de Maupas was given a seat in the senate, and then was sent to Naples as an ambassador. At the end of September 1860 he was made prefect of Bouches-du-Rhône. He resigned from this position in December 1866. He was succeeded by the less authoritarian Charles Levert. After the Franco- Prussian War (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871) and the fall of the Second French Empire, Charlemagne de Maupas returned to the Senate at the start of the French Third Republic. He ran unsuccessfully for deputy in 1876 and 1877. He died in Paris on 19 June 1888, aged 69.

She is the co-founder of the Prelinger Library in San Francisco and author of two books: Another Science Fiction: Advertising the Space Race 1957–1962 and Inside the Machine: Art and Invention in the Electronic Age. Background, archivist work Prelinger is a fifth-generation Oregonian, born in Yamhill County and raised in Eugene. After graduating Reed College, she embarked on a set of solo road trips through the interior western United States, visiting \\"landscapes\\", which she defines as places, not necessarily famous in the conventional sense, that have a human resonance. Working independently, she pursued an academic interest in \\"ephemeral literature\\", looking for sources among the discarded material from libraries and the shelves of used book stores and considering what this body of work could reveal about American history. Rick Prelinger, whose Prelinger Archives pursued similar goals as related to film, read two of her articles in the webzine/magazine Bad Subjects. They married in 1999. The Prelinger Library was launched in 2004 as the merging of their print collections and now contains more than 40,000 publications once thought to be of mere temporary interest: magazines, pamphlets, brochures and similar items that, said Megan, \\"contain micro-narratives, little stories that don't always make it into books.\\" In a 2007 Harper's Magazine profile, Gideon Lewis-Kraus described the Prelinger Library as \\"the command center\\" of the marriage, \\"which seems as much a matter of cerebral cultural gambits as of romance.\\" Megan has \\"greater seriousness of the two\\" with \\"a flinty sort of temper, but it is not easy to say anything definitive, as she and Rick tend to freely exchange attributes.\\" Megan is responsible for the library's unique classification system, which is centered on locality, beginning in the library's San Francisco location and ending in outer space. She designed the system to promote the serendipity of \\"browsing- based discoveries\\". For example, government documents are found next to their modern-day interpretations; satirical histories are shelved next to serious ones. \\"Subject-matter fiction is interspersed amongst nonfiction, and trade literature can sometimes stand for a whole topic.\\" In 2010, the San Francisco Bay Guardian awarded the Prelingers a lifetime achievement \\"Goldies\\" award. In 2013, the reopened Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco featured the Observatory Library, curated by the Prelingers, which includes five specially prepared atlases, as well as books, government documents, magazines, and videos that \\"explore natural and social forces that have impacted the bay's landscape.\\" Writing Prelinger's 2010 book, Another Science Fiction: Advertising the Space Race 1957–1962, was inspired by the contemporary advertising found in two publications: Aviation Week and Missiles and Rockets. The book chronicled an era described by Dennis Overbye in The New York Times as \\"'Mad Men' meets 'Flash Gordon'\\", a time when the future of space exploration was sometimes given to inflated predictions—lunar gardening and solar-powered space vehicles—as corporations attempted to emblazon their vision of the future and, more practically, drive employee recruitment. Overbye wrote that \\"it’s hard to know what to be more nostalgic about, all those childhood dreams of space opera or the optimism of an era in which imagination and technology were booming and every other ad ended with a pitch to come work for the thriving company of the future.\\" Research for the book began as a search for untold stories of the militarized American west and the development of the atomic bomb. As Prelinger read magazine articles of the time, she realized the advertisements \\"formed a visual language of their own that spoke to all the historical, ideological, and technological complexities that were embedded in the massive changes of the era in history.\\" She views human spaceflight as a cultural project, not just an industrial one, with the advertisements embedding both goals. Unusual among authors, Prelinger organizes her research using a database, describing herself as a FileMaker hobbyist. For Another Science Fiction, she spent a year cataloging images, eventually growing the database to about 600 records. The approach gave her a free-form medium for examining and sorting through the material using keyword searches, and the final structure varied considerably from how she first conceived it. Prelinger's second book, Inside the Machine: Art and Invention in the Electronic Age, was published by W.W. Norton & Company in August 2015. The book chronicles the history of electronics from the 1930s to the 1960s and the corresponding work of artists who pictured those advances: in advertising for products, personnel recruitment and company branding, as well as magazine articles and other educational efforts. \\"Artists bridged the gap between invention and understanding, between business and industry, and between technology and the public.\\" Prelinger wrote in the introduction. As with her previous book, she argues that art has the power to \\"create the world as we wish to see it.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Megan Prelinger projects *Boing Boing: Ingenuity presentation, August 18, 2013 * Podcast/audio: Megan Prelinger talks about ephemeral literature, the inner workings of the Prelinger Library and the possibility of looking at the world through the lens of everyday evidence at Radio Web MACBA (2015) (40 min) Category:Historians of the United States Category:American archivists Category:Female archivists Category:Writers from San Francisco Category:South Eugene High School alumni Category:Writers from Eugene, Oregon Category:People from Yamhill County, Oregon Category:1967 births Category:Reed College alumni Category:Living people Category:Women historians ","title":"Megan Prelinger"},{"id":"41599785","text":"The Kỷ line (; chi can also be translated to as branch) was the fourteenth dynasty of Hùng kings of the Hồng Bàng period of Văn Lang (now Viet Nam).

Palovarotene is being developed by Clementia Pharmaceuticals and was granted Fast Track and orphan drug designations by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FOP and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. Phase II clinical studies yielded positive results.  History  Palovarotene is a retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonist licensed to Clementia Pharmaceuticals from Roche Pharmaceuticals. At Roche, palovarotene was evaluated in more than 800 individuals including healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A one-year trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit on lung density in moderate-to-severe emphysema secondary to severe α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2011, animal studies demonstrated that RARγ agonists, including palovarotene, blocked new bone formation in both an injury-induced mouse model of heterotopic ossification (HO) and a genetically modified biological mouse model of FOP containing a continuously active ACVR1/ALK2 receptor in a dose- dependent manner. A 2016 study demonstrated that palovarotene also inhibited spontaneous heterotopic ossification, maintained limb mobility and functioning, and restored skeletal growth in FOP mouse models.

Wells's sequel to Anticipations (1901). Mankind in the Making analyzes the \\"process\\" of \\"man's making,\\" i.e. \\"the great complex of circumstances which mould the vague possibilities of the average child into the reality of the citizen of the modern state.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 5. Taking an aggressive tone in criticizing many aspects of contemporary institutions, Wells proposed a doctrine he called \\"New Republicanism,\\" which \\"tests all things by their effect upon the evolution of man.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 7. The volume consists of eleven \\"papers\\" that were first published in the British Fortnightly Review from September 1902 to September 1903 and in the American Cosmopolitan, and an appendix. It was reprinted by Chapman and Hall in 1906 in a cheaper edition,A copy of this edition can be found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. and again in 1914, on the eve of World War I. Synopsis=Preface= Wells proposes to \\"provide the first tentatives of a political doctrine that shall be equally available for application in the British Empire and the United States.\\" He notes an \\"especial indebtedness to my friend, Mr. Graham Wallas.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Preface [dated July 1903]. =Chapter 1: The New Republic= Renouncing any claim to an \\"absolute truth\\" on the ethical, social, and political questions addressed in this volume, Wells says his views are \\"designed first for those who are predisposed for their reception.\\" He proposes as a \\"general principle\\" a doctrine he dubs \\"New Republicanism,\\" based on a view of life as \\"a tissue and succession of births.\\" Only in the 19th century, with the idea of organic evolution, has such a view become \\"definite and pervading,\\" \\"alter[ing] the perspective of every human affair\\" and enabling a criterion of judgment based on \\"wholesome and hopeful births.\\" No existing political party is based on such a view. New Republicanism, then, exists \\"to get better births and a better result from the births we get.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 1. =Chapter 2: The Problem of the Birth Supply= Because of \\"an absolute want of knowledge\\" in the domain of the \\"missing science of heredity,\\" Wells rejects the notion, advanced by followers of Francis Galton like Max Nordau, that the state should try to breed human beings selectively: \\"we are, as a matter of fact, not a bit clear what points to breed for and what points to breed out.\\" He argues that such supposed positive traits as beauty, health, capacity, genius (Wells does not refer to \\"intelligence\\"), as well as such supposed negative traits as criminality and alcoholism, are in fact such complex entanglements of characteristics that \\"ignorance and doubt bar our way.\\" Transmission of specific diseases may be an exception. Research in this area is urgent need of support. At the level of individual action, however, New Republicans are to \\"use our judgments to the utmost to do each what seems to him probably right.\\" Laws that \\"foster and protect the cowardly and the mean\\" or \\"guard stupidity\\" should be altered.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 2. =Chapter 3: Certain Wholesale Aspects of Man-Making= As for the upbringing of children, any notion of \\"Nature's trustworthiness\\" is rejected out of hand: \\"The very existence and nature of man is an interference with Nature and Nature's ways.\\" A child needs (i) \\"exclusively to itself\\" the \\"constant loving attention\\" of \\"a mother or. . . some well-affected girl or woman\\" who is in good health; (ii) warmth; (iii) shelter; (iv) cleanliness; (v) bright lights; (vi) good food; (vii) intelligent and articulate caretaking; (viii) access to skilled medical care. Wells doubts whether more than a quarter of the children born in England grow up in such conditions. He cites statistics from Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine demonstrating class differences, and infant mortality statistics suggesting \\"a holocaust of children\\" is occurring in industrial areas like Lancashire.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 3, §1. Rejecting an approach to the problem via philanthropic homes because these encourage \\"inferior people\\" to have children and in any case \\"do not work,\\" Wells argues that public policy ought to \\"discourage reckless parentage\\" but not lighten at all the burden of parental responsibility. He proposes that the state determine standards for the care of children, and when parents are unable to meet the standards they should be \\"charged with the cost of a suitable maintenance.\\" This will discourage \\"inferior people\\" from reproducing. Also conducive to this end is a minimum wage set to allow for a life that is \\"wholesome, healthy. . . by the standards of comfort at the time.\\" Industries incapable of sustaining such a wage are only \\"a disease and a parasite upon the public body.\\" People unemployable at this minimum wage are \\"people of the Abyss\\" who will thus be \\"swept out of [their] rookeries and hiding-places.\\" In this dispensation, \\"[t]hey would exist, but they would not multiply—and that is our supreme end.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 3, §2. =Chapter 4: The Beginning of the Mind and Language= Wells views a child at birth as \\"at first no more than an animal,\\" but during the first year \\"a mind, a will, a personality, the beginning of all that is real and spiritual in man\\" \\"creeps in\\" in the course of a \\"process\\" that is \\"unanalyzable.\\" What the child needs for development is \\"a succession of interesting things,\\" and poor children are \\"least at a disadvantage\\" during this phase. The \\"almost constant presence of the mother\\" is ideal, and is, indeed, the reason for monogamy's \\"practical sanction.\\" Simple toys that can be variously manipulated are best.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 4, §1. \\"With speech humanity begins.\\" Wells, following Froebel, emphasizes the child's need to hear clear consistent speech, and disapproves of baby talk and of nurses speaking foreign tongues. Wells notes that \\"only a very small minority of English or American people have more than half mastered\\" English, and expostulates on the unnecessary impoverishment of English speech that is maintained as a social norm. \\"Saving\\" English is necessary \\"if we wish to save the future of the world.\\" Wells advocates promoting throughout the world \\"one accent, one idiom, and one intonation\\" of English. Better materials for the teaching of language need to be developed by an \\"English Language Society\\" made up of \\"affluent and vigorous people.\\" Wells also makes practical pedagogical suggestions, like advocating paraphrasing to teach writing.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 4, §2. Wells gives practical suggestions for the teaching of shapes and numbers; he is a great advocate of wooden blocks. He sketches the state of a child's imaginative world \\"at or about the fifth year,\\" when \\"formal education. . . ought to begin.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 4, §3. =Chapter 5: The Man-Making Forces of the Modern State= A key factor in human development is the home, understood broadly as the circle of people with whom the child is in \\"constant, close contact.\\" The impression of home life on the child is nearly indelible, and derives principally from * tradition * \\"economic necessities\\" * \\"the influx of new systems of thought, of feeling, and of interpretation about the general issues of life.\\" In Great Britain there are three main traditions: \\"the aristocratic, the middle, and the labour class.\\" But \\"new necessities\\" are remoulding them. — Schools should cultivate the habit of industry, but moral, religious, aesthetic, and philosophical instruction they are ill-equipped to give, much less the impetus to Great Britain's much needed renewal of \\"national energy,\\" for the average man derives his \\"moral code\\" chiefly from his \\"school- fellows,\\" not from school.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 5. =Chapter 6: Schooling= Class instruction and learning to read and write constitute the initial stage of schooling; they mark \\"a stage in the civilizing process.\\" \\"When tribes coalesce into nations, schools appear.\\" Counting, and a second \\"culture tongue\\" as a key to a higher culture, are also general, though the latter is being superseded in France, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Wells emphasizes the tendency to introduce into the curriculum elements \\"irrelevant to schooling proper\\"; these are justifiable only if they serve \\"to widen the range of intercourse.\\" Wells proposes an apparently modest but really quite ambitious curriculum. It demands a thorough overhaul of how English composition is taught, and, except for physics and some rudiments of the concepts of chemistry, regards most instruction in facts of science, history, etc., as superfluous; these are relegated to the school library and the initiative of the student. Wells also emphasizes the importance of giving children enough time for free play, which he defines as \\"a spontaneous employment into which imagination enters,\\" and privacy.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 6. =Chapter 7: Political and Social Influences= As for politics and society, New Republicanism takes the position that any institution that does not \\"mould men into fine and vigorous forms\\" must \\"be destroyed.\\" Such an institution is the British monarchy, a \\"stupendous sham.\\" Wells argues, referring to Ch. 3 of his earlier Anticipations (1901), that \\"in a sense, the British system, the pyramid of King, land-owning and land-ruling aristocracy, yeoman and trading middle-class and labourers, is dead—it died in the nineteenth century under wheels of mechanism.\\" But an extended comparison shows that American conditions do not offer a desirable alternative. As a \\"crude suggestion,\\" Wells ponders the possibility of election of public officials by juries. As for honors, Wells proposes the development of a \\"generally non-hereditary functional nobility.\\" The new methods could later be extended to the control of property, for \\" 'We are all Socialists nowadays,' \\" in addition to the further development of taxing property transfers. =Chapter 8: The Cultivation of the Imagination= Adolescence and the awakening of sexual interest signify that \\"the race, the species, is claiming the individual\\" and indeed is \\"the source of all our power in life.\\" Apart from the affirmation of the importance of motherhood and the necessity of taboos, Wells admits: \\"I have no System—I wish I had,\\" no \\"doctrine of sexual conduct.\\" Not rules, but wisdom for oneself and patience for others are needed. One of the functions of literature is to record \\"experiments in the science of this central field of human action.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 8, §1. \\"[W]e are all too careless of the quality of the stuff that reaches the eyes and ears of our children.\\" Wells endorses censorship: \\"I am on the side of the Puritans here, unhesitatingly.\\" Wells proposes that a category of \\"adult\\" art, literature, and science be recognized, and that \\"a high minimum price\\" be set for it, since few children can spend much. Alternately, an age limit could be set; Wells proposes eighteen. \\"[W]hat is here proposed is not so much the suppression of information as of a certain manner of presenting information, and our intention is at most to delay, and to give the wholesome aspect first.\\" \\"[F]or the rest, in this matter—leave them alone.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 8, §2. =Chapter 9: The Organization of Higher Education= At the age of fifteen, after \\"nine or ten years of increasingly serious Schooling (Primary Education),\\" Wells would have inferior students shunted into \\"employment suited to their capacity, employment which should not carry with it any considerable possibility of prolific marriage,\\" and have the others proceed to \\"Secondary Education, or College.\\" Here, he stresses the importance of \\"good general text-books in each principal subject\\" developed by universities as the basis of instruction, rather than a professor's lectures. Students must be engaged in \\"discussion, reproduction, and dispute\\" of the facts and ideas of their subject—a \\"substantial mental training\\" for a specialty being more important than cultivation of a \\"general culture.\\" He contemplates four possible courses for the student: \\"The Classical, the Historical, the Biological, and the Physical.\\" In the third stage of education, \\"the University Course,\\" lasting \\"for three or four years after eighteen or twenty-one,\\" in such subjects as medicine, law, engineering, philosophy and theology, physical science, etc. Wells also insists on the importance of ensuring that \\"serious books\\" be available in public libraries, with guides to reading in various subjects.H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 9. =Chapter 10: Thought in the Modern State= Upon thought depends the hope of achieving civilization, for society is now hobbled by having become \\"a heterogeneous confusion without any secure common grounds of action.\\" Thought requires * \\"a sympathetic and intelligent atmosphere\\" * a \\"language. . . ready for. . . use\\" * \\"a certain minimum of training and preparation\\" * a sense that \\"for some reason—not necessarily a worldly one—the thing [is] 'worth while.'\\" \\"Literature is a vitally necessary function of the modern state.\\" What is most needed at present in English thought is to put \\"critical literature\\" on a sound footing, and Wells proposes the organization of \\"a large Guild of literary men and women,\\" as well as \\"university lectureships and readerships in contemporary criticism.\\" As for literature, Wells argues that \\"it is only by the payment of authors, and if necessary their endowment in a spacious manner, and in particular by the entire separation of the rewards of writing from the accidents of the book market, that the function of literature can be adequately discharged in the modern state.\\" This should be awarded not by a single body but according to the principle of \\"Many Channels,\\" and inclusively rather than exclusively: if many \\"shams\\" are subsidized, \\"it scarcely matters.\\" Further, in order to \\"protect the author from the pressure of immediate necessities,\\" copyright should rest inalienably in his hands, any countervailing arrangement being limited to term of seven years, unless the author void copyright altogether as a \\"present to the world.\\" Wells suggests the endowment of \\"a thousand or so authors,\\" and offers, a detailed plan of how this could be done, as \\"an efficient starting-point\\" that will doubtless be developed in many directions, a process he calls the \\"innervation of society.\\"H.G. Wells, Mankind in the Making, Ch. 10. =Chapter 11: The Man's Own Share= Wells's vision of \\"New Republicanism\\" culminates in \\"the rough outline of an ideal new state, a New Republic, a great confederation of English-speaking republican communities, each with its non-hereditary aristocracy, scattered about the world, speaking a common language, possessing a common literature and a common scientific and, in its higher stages at least, a common educational organization.\\" Many \\"pioneers and experimenters\\" are already working to fulfill this vision. \\"[I]n a few years\\" this \\"will have become a great world movement,\\" though only \\"the young\\" (under thirty) will see \\"the Promised Land.\\" Only \\"a few thousands\\" of devoted New Republicans are needed to realize this vision. =Appendix: A Paper on Administrative Areas Read before the Fabian Society [March 1903]= Wells rejects communistic socialism and proclaims himself a \\"moderate socialist\\" whose goal is \\"equality of opportunity and freedom for complete individual development.\\" His argument against \\"private owners\\" and in favor of \\"public officials\\" is based on the principle of efficiency. And this is his reason for condemning existing \\"local government bodies\\" as \\"impossibly small,\\" because \\"a revolution in the methods of locomotion\\" has fundamentally altered the economy. Administrators need to adjust to \\"a larger community of a new type,\\" as Wells explained in Anticipations. In southern England this should embrace \\"the whole valley of the Thames and its tributaries\\" as well as \\"Sussex and Surrey, and the east coast counties up to the Wash,\\" i.e. all of southeastern England. Composition The success of Anticipations in 1901 led to a demand for a sequel, which Wells wrote while his wife was pregnant with his second child, Frank Richard, born on Oct. 31, 1903.Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster), p. 179. Graham Wallas greatly influenced Mankind in the Making, especially the first few chapters.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 99). Their collaboration on the book occasioned on Sept. 19, 1902, one of Wells's longest and most revealing letters.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 145 & 528n.24). Shortly after the publication of Mankind in the Making Wells and Wallas hiked for two weeks in Switzerland; their exchanges greatly influenced Wells's next venture in social thought, A Modern Utopia.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 146). Later, Wallas would also help Wells with The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1932). Reception Wells considered Mankind in the Making weaker than his other books on modern socialism, Anticipations, A Modern Utopia, and New Worlds for Old: in his Experiment in Autobiography he describes the book as ‘my style at its worst and my matter at its thinnest, and quoting it makes me feel very sympathetic with those critics who, to put it mildly, restrain their admiration for me.’ It was praised, though, by Henry James, Leopold Amery, Ford Madox Ford, Ray Lankester, Morley Roberts, Violet Paget (Vernon Lee), and C.F.G. Masterman; many of them, however, found it excessively optimistic.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 99). Arnold Bennett called the book sloppy in thought and turgid in expression.Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography\\" (New York: Simon and Schuster), p. 180. Joseph Conrad thought it showed Wells to be \\"so strangely conservative at bottom.\\"Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography\\" (New York: Simon and Schuster), p. 180. Wells was disappointed that most reviewers took the book as categorical and predictive rather than as tentative and exploratory.Michael Sherborne, H.G.

In 1989 many Vietnamese refugees were sent back, violating Malaysia's agreement with the UN to help the refugees. Approximately 5,401 refugees were denied asylum in Malaysia. At a conference in Geneva in June 1989, an agreement had been reached stating that refugees arriving past March 1989 were no longer automatically labeled as refugees. As Vietnam began to witness economic growth in the early 1990s, the number of refugee arrivals also quickly dropped in the early 1990s.

Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from November to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.The Unique Flora of Tasmania , Hobart District Group of The Australian Plants Society - Tasmania Inc. Taxonomy Eucalyptus pulchella was first formally described in 1829 by the botanist René Louiche Desfontaines in his book Catalogus Plantarum Horti Regii Parisiensis. The Australian Plant Census lists the synonyms as Eucalyptus linearis, described in 1832 by Friedrich Dehnhardt in Catalogus Plantarum Horti Camaldulensis and as Eucalyptus amygdalina var. angustifolia by Joseph Burtt Davy in Cyclopedia of American horticulture from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. The species name pulchella is a diminutive of the word pulcher which in Latin means beautiful. The common name, white peppermint, refers to its smooth white trunk. Distribution and Habitat Eucalyptus pulchella is endemic to the lowlands of south-east Tasmania where it inhabits undulating, hilly terrain at altitudes between 100-500m above sea level. The interaction between aspect, soil type and water drainage play an important role in determining the distribution of E.pulchella. It occurs on the upper north-west facing slopes of free-draining dolerite capped hills where soils are shallow. On such ridgetops water availability is limited due to the binding capacity of the Jurassic dolerite substrate and the shallow soil depth. Dry conditions due to the effect of soil are enhanced by aspect affect in which north-west facing slopes receive high solar insolation loads and are susceptible to periods of drought stress. The ability of E. pulchella to resist occasional severe drought explains its distribution on dry dolerite ridgetops. Although locally widespread E. pulchella is restricted to south-east Tasmania which may be explained by a glacial tree line preventing its spread into suitable habitats further north. Although E. pulchella extends outside its range reaching as far north as Bothwell, its true distribution is difficult to discern due to error involved with field identification due to a 'half barked' intergrading form of Eucalyptus amygdalina. E. pulchella is a lowland species where it occurs on the upper slopes of well-drained sites with a Jurassic dolerite substrate in grassy or heathy open forests. Such sites typically have a north-west facing aspect with exposure to high solar insolation loads resulting in periodic drought stress. Eucalyptus pulchella occurs as a small to medium-sized spreading tree as the dominant species in grassy to heathy dry sclerophyll open forest and woodlands. Such dry sclerophyll communities have an open structure and rarely grow taller than 25m. The understory is typically dominated by the ground cover layer including native grasses and sedges such as Lomandra longifolia and is the most diverse. The shrub layer is sparse and typically includes species such as Exocarpos cupressiformis however, if the fire interval exceeds a 15-year interval the shrub may become dominant in the understory. E. pulchella is not always the dominant species, in sections of the east coast, hybrids between E. pulchella and E. amygdalina and genetic variants of E. amygdalina may act as the dominant species. Eucalyptus pulchella also commonly forms mixed stands with E. globulus, E. viminalis and E. rubida. Ecology=Fire= Eucalyptus pulchella like many other species from the family Myrtaceae requires fire at least once in its lifetime in order to retain disclimax vegetation and complete its lifecycle. Seeds of Eucalyptus are held in woody capsules which often remain on the tree for several years after reaching maturity. A fire event is required to dry out and open the woody capsule to release the seed. Fire creates a sterile, nutrient enriched ashbed which favours shade-intolerant eucalypt seedlings by eliminating any competitors. In fact, dry sclerophyll communities and Eucalyptus species are fire promoting. The flammable nature of eucalypt bark and leaf litter which persists on the forest floor and the volatile oils in the leaves held in the canopy promote a fire frequency of approximately 20 years in dry sclerophyll communities. As well as seed regeneration, eucalypts utilise vegetative regeneration to recover from fire depending on its intensity. Eucalypts can do this by basal sprouting from lignotubers or from the stem, sprouting from epicormic buds. =Pollination= Eucalyptus are preferential outcrossers and production of seed is dependent on animal vectors to transfer pollen between flowers due to the unsuitability of the pollen to be transported by wind. Pollinators are generally unspecific and tend to include both birds and insects which are attracted to the flower by a nectar reward. It is likely that pollen is transferred within a close proximity to its source due to the close to nearest-neighbour foraging pattern employed by birds. E. pulchella flowers at high intensity for approximately 2 months during summer reaching its peak around November =Seed dispersal= In Eucalyptus seed is housed in a woody capsule and is released through valves which open after the capsule has dried out. The capsules tend to be retained in the canopy for several years after reaching maturity. Seed is released on mass following a fire event or extremely hot weather conditions. Seed is typically dispersed one canopy height away from the base of the tree and apart from seed harvesting by ants, movement is limited once it hits the ground.

Geography  After a journey of 160 km (east bound), the river flows into the Saint-Maurice River (on the west bank) about 23 km (by water) upstream (north) of Beaumont dam in the City of La Tuque and 20 km downstream (south) of Rapide-Blanc dam. It is one of the largest tributaries of the Saint-Maurice River. Other important rivers are Matawin, Manouane, Trenche and La Croche. The Launay lake, located north-west of Galifet township, is the head of the Vermillon River. Down, the water flows through several rapids and falls and sometimes fellow a circuitous route in townships of Galifet, The Pottery, Dupuis and Picard. At the level of the dam of \\"Lac Brûlé\\" (Burned lake) (formerly designated Vermilion-A), the Vermillon River turns north-east through the townships of Bisaillon, Olscamps and Payment, heading towards its mouth.Names and places of Quebec, the work of the Geographical Names Board published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed, and in that of a CD produced by Micro - Intel in 1997 from this dictionary. in its course the river flows prior to the southeast, then follows a segment 51.3 km to the northeast and finally bifurcates at 90 degrees for the last segment of 8.5 km flowing eastward to its mouth.Geographical audit performed in January 2014 by this historian Gaétan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC)  Toponymy  \\"Vermillon - Two dam\\" was erected near the railway stop Rapide-Blanc, Quebec, at a place called Vermillon or 5 km upstream of the river mouth. The name Vermillon also refers to two lakes and a small river, located in the area of \\"Vermillon - Two\\". The name refers to the vermilion bright red yellowish. Some authors suggest that as the beginning of the name would be based on a French translation of an amérindianyme. Once in the native manners, often painted their indigenous body with chalk in flamboyant colors. In 1824, during his testimony to the House of Assembly of Lower Canada, explorer and woodsman Francis Verreault emphasizes the Raman (Vermilion) River. In addition, Romaine River, in Côte-Nord (North Shore) region was originally designated Ouramane (Olomane) meaning \\"vermilion\\". In his handwritten notes of his travels, written no later than 1830, merchant Jean-Baptiste Perrault wrote: \\"From there to the Vermillon River and the second port of Vermillon\\". The Abenaki, in turn, means that river under the name Azobakhigan, which means \\"Where we paddle quickly\\". For Atikamekws, this river is named Kanimepirikaci Matawa, a tributary of Lake carp. The name \\"Vermillon River\\" was officially registered on December 5, 1968, the Bank of place names in Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec).

In response, Christie described his former team as having been \\"completely exonerated\\" and blamed prosecutors appointed by Barack Obama. Kelly told Reuters that she believed \\"while this may finally have made this case right for me, it does not absolve those who should have truly been held accountable.\\" The ruling was described as \\"the latest instance in which the Supreme Court hemmed in prosecutors in corruption cases involving political figures.\\" The Financial Times described the state of New Jersey as being \\"well versed in political corruption\\" but also that Bridgegate was a \\"particularly baroque\\" episode.

It is located in the village of Brekke. It is the church for the Brekke parish which is part of the Nordhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1862 using designs by the architect Christian Henrik Grosch. The church seats about 390 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church at Brekke date back to the year 1327, but it was not new that year. The first church was likely a stave church and it was known as the Risnefjord Church (), after the local fjord (it was later named Brekke Church). There was also a small annex chapel located on the Haugland farm, about to the south of the village of Brekke. Both churches are mentioned in the same source from 1327. The Haugland Chapel is not mentioned in any sources after about 1340. Around 1591, the old church was torn down and a new church was built in the village of Brekke, just up the hill from the shoreline. In 1686, the wooden church was described as a small, log building with tower. The nave measured about and the choir measured . At that time, the building was described as in poor condition and uneven. The church had only room for 130 people and it was less than half the size of what the law required. The Church Act of 1851, instructed the local authorities to ensure that the churches should have room for at least 30% of the population of the parish. This (eventually) led to the old church being torn down and replaced. In 1862, a new church was constructed just south of the old church. The new church was consecrated on 19 November 1862 by the local Dean Thomas Erichsen. After the new church was consecrated, the old church was torn down. The new church was larger, having a nave measuring and a square choir with each side measuring . The new church had a small tower and right away, the residents of the parish were unhappy with the design of the tower. It wasn't until a renovation that was completed in 1939 that gave the parish a new, taller tower that was covered in a copper roof.

It is located in the village of Eivindvik. It is the church for the Gulen parish which is part of the Nordhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1863 using designs by the architect Georg Andreas Bull. The church seats about 700 people. The church stands on a hill in central Eivindvik, with magnificent views towards the Gulafjorden. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1327, but the church was not new that year. Eivindvik is regarded as a very old church site, perhaps one of the oldest in the country. The two stone crosses which stand close to the church are over a thousand years old. This is probably where the first Christians in the area gathered, until they built themselves a church. The first church was likely a stave church, and it was originally (for centuries) called Evindvig Church (), using the old spelling of the village of Eivindvik. During the late 1500s, the old church was torn down and replaced on the same site by a small timber-framed long church. The vicar Niels Griis Alstrup Dahl (1778–1852) was an avid proponent of building a new church in Eivindvik, and he worked extensively towards that goal. When he died in 1852, the reaction of many in the community was that it important to build the new church to pay tribute to the memory of Dahl. The local council sent the government an application to build a church that seats 700 people. In 1860, a royal decree was handed down that gave the municipality permission to build a church of that size. The municipal council then resolved that the ground work should be performed by compulsory work with crews of six men daily, two days per landowning farmer and one day per farm worker. It wasn't until 1863 that work commenced. The old church was torn down and replaced with the present church which is located on the same site. The church was consecrated on 13 December 1863 by the local Dean Thomas Erichsen. The new church was large, with a nave measuring and a choir measuring . The choir is unique in that it is made semi-octagonal in shape (making up five sides of the eight). In 1890, the municipality and the church changed their names to Gulen, after the old Gulating assembly.

He scored a UK top 10 hit in 2000 with his song, \\"Battle\\". Biography Chue's career began in 1991 as a producer for UK R&B;/reggae artist Wayne Marshall, producing most of Marshall's debut album 90 Degrees and Rising in 1994. Shortly after, Chue became writer/producer for Soul II Soul at their studio, working with Jazzie B for several years. He would also go on to produce for Dynamite MC and Doom Man. Chue has remixed tracks by Destiny's Child, Public Enemy and Nas, among others. In the late 1990s, the 'Wookie sound' became apparent in his bootleg mixes of songs by Whitney Houston, Brandy and Debelah Morgan. One of the original innovators of UK garage, Wookie scored a huge underground club hit in 1999 with \\"Scrappy\\". Also in that year, he released his first official remix of the Gabrielle song \\"Sunshine\\", under the name 'Wookie'. Another hit remix was released in 2000 under the alias Exemen, of Sia's song \\"Little Man\\". Wookie scored his first UK top 10 hit single in 2000 with \\"Battle\\". Two of his other songs, \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"Back Up (To Me)\\" also made the UK charts. His self-titled debut album was also released in 2000. Wookie has reproduced tracks for artists such as Jessie J, Rizzle Kicks, Sia Furler, Justin Timberlake, Roll Deep, Ray Foxx, and many others. In 2013, Wookie appeared alongside many other garage pioneers in a documentary exploring the legacy of UK garage, Rewind 4Ever: The History of UK Garage. Also in 2013, Wookie produced remixes of Disclosure's \\"Voices\\" and Eliza Doolittle's \\"Walking on Water\\". On 31 December 2013, Wookie together with Zed Bias headlined the Bruk Out party at the Big Chill House in Kings Cross, London.

It is located near the town of Sabie, 5 km from Pilgrim's Rest. While a number of small gold deposits had been discovered in the northern parts of South Africa between 1840 and 1870, Mac-Mac was the first place where payable quantities of gold were found. In 1873 gold was discovered on the farm Geelhoutboom. President Burgers officially named the area the New Caledonian Gold Fields, but it became known as Mac-Mac because of the amount of Scottish diggers at the camp. Within one year, 1,500 diggers made 4,000 claims. The nearby Mac Mac twin falls, originally a single stream, acquired their current appearance when gold miners blasted the stream to reach the gold-bearing reef over which it drops. In the late 1990s the old forestry station and forester houses were used to start the Mac Mac Forest Retreat.

It is not known when Lady Yang married Ma Xisheng; however, it would have been, at the latest, 929, late in Ma Yin's reign, for that year, it was said that it was her family member Yang Zhaosui (), who was then serving as the commander of the Wu'an army (the title that her father Yang Shi had previously held) and who wanted to displace the position of Chu's chief strategist Gao Yu, who repeatedly made accusations against Gao to Ma Xisheng, to whom Ma Yin had transferred the reins of state by that point. This led to Ma Xisheng's persuading Ma Yin to relieve Gao of his military command, and subsequently Ma Xisheng's killing of Gao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276.  During and after Ma Xisheng's reign  Ma Yin died in 930, and Ma Xisheng succeeded him as Chu's ruler. It is not clear what kind of title Lady Yang might have carried during Ma Xisheng's rule, for he himself, at the directions left by his father, did not claim any princely titles.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. However, it was known that because of her, her brother Yang Zhaohui () was made the prefect of Heng Prefecture (衡州, in modern Hengyang, Hunan). He gathered much wealth, built a large mansion, and had two of his sons made officers of the headquarters guard corps. It was said that because he became rich and powerful in his youth, he was arrogant and found ways to use his power to bully people, leading to the intelligentsia of the state all despising him. Ma Xisheng died in 932 and was succeeded by his brother Ma Xifan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. It appeared (based the later description of her family's fate) that Lady Yang returned to her family. By 950, Chu was embroiled in a civil war, between then-ruler Ma Xiguang and Ma Xi'e the military governor of Wuping Circuit (武平, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan) — both of them Ma Yin's sons and Ma Xisheng's younger brothers. In 950, after Ma Xi'e was able to persuade Ma Xiguang's general Xu Keqiong into defecting and surrendering Changsha to him, Changsha fell, leading to a general pillaging of the capital city.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. The officer Lu Mengjun (), who had long despised the Yangs, used this opportunity to attack the Yangs' mansion and slaughter them. However, it was said that Lady Yang's fate, after the slaughter, was unknown.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 71.

History right After the demise of Sri Ramakrishna, the 19th century mystic and saint, some of his younger disciples decided to stay together and perform spiritual practices following the ideology of saint. Prominent among them were Narendra Nath Dutta, later famous as Swami Vivekananda and Rakhal Chandra Ghosh, later Swami Brahmananda, who was also the first president of the Ramakrishna Order. The first monastery of the Ramakrishna order was established in Baranagar, Calcutta and it came to be known as the Baranagar Math. The dilapidated building of Baranagar Math could not serve the monastery for long and hence in 1892, the Math was shifted to a new building in Alambazar, a place in Baranagar. The building was dis reputed as a haunted house as two persons had committed suicide there and hence it was available cheap. =Building layout= The house was fairly large, quadrangular, two storey building comprising two sections, outer and inner. The Early History of Ramakrishna Movement, by Swami Prabhananda, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, The Ramakrishna shrine in the Alambazar Math was situated in the first floor of the building. The brother disciples slept together in the large hall in the ground floor. The building was adorned with a pond, several country wells and an orchard. There were balconies on the ground and first floor and the building overlooked the present Deshbandhu Road. There were two flights of stairs to reach the first floor. Near the shrine were three rooms used by Swami Nirmalananda, Swami Abhedananda, and Swami Ramakrishnananda. Vivekananda stayed in the second room in the western side of the first floor. =Members= When the Math premises were shifted, at that time most of the brother disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, including Swami Vivekananda, were wandering monks in various parts of India. Swami Ramakrishnananda assisted for most part of the period by Swami Nirmalananda was the only person who stayed indoor throughout and took care of the activities of the monastery during this period. Among the direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda came back to Alambazar Math in 1895. Swami Turiyananda and Swami Shivananda returned to stay in the Math in 1894. Swami Premananda came back a few days after the return of Swami Vivekananda. Swami Niranjananda returned to stay before the birth anniversary of Sri Ramakrishna in 1895. Swami Saradananda was a permanent resident from the beginning, from where he left for Europe in 1895. Swami Abhedananda also traveled widely before he settled in Alambazar Math in 1892. Swami Trigunatitananda stayed for about two years, from 1892 to 1894. Brahmachari Hariprasanna, later Swami Vijnanananda, joined Alambazar Math after the return of Swami Vivekananda. New members who joined as Brahmacharins or monks, who stayed in Alambazar monastery included Swami Virajananda and Swami Nirbhayananda. =Important visitors= Durga Charan Nag, better known as Nag Mahasay, an important householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, visited the Math. Girish Chandra Ghosh, the famous playwright and father of modern theater in India, used to visit the monastery as a devotee. In 1896, Dr. Turnbull, who had heard Swami Vivekananda in Chicago and was an ardent fan, visited Alambazar Math. Gopaler Ma and Gauri Ma, two foremost women devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, were also occasional visitors. =Important events= Swami Vivekananda went to America in 1893 and participated in the parliament of religions when the monastery was located in Alambazar. He also came back to stay in Alambazar monastery. He wrote several letters to his brother disciples in Alambazar Math, several of which were addressed to Swami Ramakrishnananda, between 1894 and 1896. He advised them on management affairs, Governing Body and also the organization structure and activities of the proposed monastery.Letters of Swami Vivekananda The inmates of Alambazar Math, most notably Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda (Yogin Maharaj) organized a public convention to declare Swami Vivekananda as the official representative of Hinduism in Calcutta Townhall, which was presided by Raja Pyarimohan Mukherjee and attended by the famous persons of Calcutta in 1894. After his return from the West, Swami Vivekananda, stayed for sometime in the Alambazar Math and here he framed the rules and guidelines for a future Ramakrishna Order. An earthquake on 12 June 1897 caused much damage to the building, and the monastery had to be shifted to Nilambar Mukherjee's garden house in Belur. It is in this Math that Swamiji first taught systematic meditation to the disciples. In this Math Swamiji first gave the vow of Sannyasa to his disciples. =Swami Jitatmananda= Swami Jitatmananda is a monk of the Ramakrishna order.

It is to this Alambazar Math that Swami Vivekananda entered on the very evening he came back to Calcutta after his western conquest, and he lived here, with occasional gaps from 19 February 1897 to February 1898. Swamiji is spreading the universal messages of Vedanta, Science and Spirituality as preached and practiced by Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. He holds regular classes on Vedanta & conducts sessions on meditation for public, especially the younger generation on every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday from 5 pm to 6.30 pm in this Math. Celebrations in the Math It is in this Math that the first birthday celebration of Sarada Devi was organized on 16 December 1897. Swami Prakashananda conducted the worship and the homa (fire) ceremony.[S.P: p. 92] In October 1897 Durga Puja was celebrated in at this Math. It was conducted with a photo of Mother instead of the Durga image. On the Kali Puja night the inmates performed \\"Guru Puja\\". Premananda performed the puja and homa.[S.P: p. 160] Adbhutananda (Latu) and one Shivaratri night conducted the worship of Shiva throughout the four quarters of the night [Ghatanabali] Present state The building remained in a dilapidated state, was neglected for about seventy years and was forcefully occupied through illegal encroachments. Swami Satyananda, a disciple of Swami Abhedananda, first started the initiative to reclaim the historic building. A portion was finally purchased in 1968. The tenants opposed the establishment of the monastery and they threatened the monks. Slowly all the rooms were occupied by the newly established Sri Ramakrishna Satyananda Ashrama and most of the tenants agreed to leave after being paid hefty compensation. In 2007 the remaining portion of the old monastery building was purchased but it was still not completely encroachment free. As part of the celebration of 150 years of Swami Vivekananda, Government of India has officially recognized the Alambazar Math as a national heritage structure and has initiated a project to restore the building and set up a Vivekananda Centre for Spiritual Culture. Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh wrote an appreciation letter and with his help, the ministry of culture, Government of India's National Culture Fund, has come forward to help partially fund the restoration work. Archaeological Survey of India has taken up the restoration and reconstruction project.

Raised as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War, it was established at Enoggera in December 1915, forming part of the 11th Brigade in the 3rd Division. It subsequently served on the Western Front in France and Belgium in 1916–18 before being disbanded on 22 October 1918. In 1921, the battalion was reformed as part of the Citizens Forces becoming known as the 42nd Battalion (Capricornia Regiment). Following the outbreak of the Second World War the battalion held a number of training exercises and camps until 1941, before being mobilised in March 1942 as part of the 29th Brigade, in the 5th Division. It subsequently served in New Guinea fighting against the Japanese during 1943–44 and on Bougainville in 1945, before being disbanded on 7 May 1946. In 1948, it was reformed as part of the re-raised Citizens Military Forces. Today, its lineage is perpetuated by the 31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, a unit which continues to serve in the Australian Army Reserve. History=First World War= The 42nd Battalion was raised at Enoggera near Brisbane, Queensland, in December 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War. Due to sharing its numerical designation with the famous Scottish regiment, the battalion became known as the \\"Australian Black Watch\\". Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Woolcock the battalion was part of the 11th Brigade of the 3rd Division, which was formed in Australia as part of an expansion of the AIF following the Gallipoli campaign. After completing training in Australia and Britain the battalion deployed to France on 26 November 1916 to fight against German forces on the Western Front, taking up positions on the frontline in December where it endured the winter of 1916–17, as well as completing further training and labouring tasks in the rear areas when not in the line. During 1917 the 3rd Division operated in the Ypres sector in Belgium, with the battalion taking part in the battle at Messines in June, Warneton in late July, Broodseinde in early October, and then at Passchendaele on 12 October where it sustained heavy casualties, mainly due to German gas attacks. The battalion remained in Belgium for the following five months, rotating between the front and rear areas. In March 1918, it moved to France to help blunt the German Spring Offensive, repelling a German attack around Morlancourt. During the lull that followed, the battalion was subsequently involved in the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918. When the Allies launched their own offensive in August, the 42nd Battalion was involved in the initial attack around Amiens and then the subsequent advance that followed as the Allies attempted to penetrate the Hindenburg Line. Its final involvement in the fighting came during the fighting at St Quentin Canal during the period 29 September to 2 October. After this, the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation, and the 42nd Battalion was disbanded on 22 October 1918 to provide reinforcements for other AIF units, which had suffered heavy casualties throughout the year. During its service the battalion sustained a total of 544 killed and 1,450 wounded. The battalion's last man (of 2,954), Sergeant Robert S. Melloy, died on 23 January 1995, at age 97.Arnison, Peter. \\"Intrepid Digger shaped by defining experience of conflict.\\" The Australian, 21 March 1995. =Inter-war years= In 1921, after the demobilisation of the AIF was completed, Australia's part-time military force, the Citizens Forces (later the \\"Militia\\"), was reorganised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF. As a result, the battalion was reformed as a part- time unit, drawing lineage and personnel from the 2nd Battalion, 42nd Infantry Regiment and elements of the 9th, 47th and 52nd Infantry Regiments. In 1927, when territorial designations were introduced, the battalion became known as the 42nd Battalion (Capricornia Regiment). It also adopted the motto of Cede Nullius. With its men mainly recruited from Sarina, Carmilla, and Yeppoon in Central Queensland, it had training centres in Rockhampton, Mount Morgan, and briefly also in Gladstone and Mackay. From 1937 to 1939 the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Martin. =Second World War= Following the outbreak of the Second World War the battalion held a number of training exercises and camps at Yeppoon until 1941, as the Militia battalions were tasked with improving the nation's readiness for war. During this time the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Heron, who had taken up command of the battalion in January 1940. In March 1942, as the threat posed by the Japanese in the Pacific grew, the battalion was mobilised for full-time service and moved to Tiaro. There, it concentrated with the 15th and 47th Battalions to form the 29th Brigade, 5th Division. In early 1942, the 29th Brigade moved to Townsville and was tasked with preparing defensive positions between Giru and Rollingstone in case of a Japanese invasion. It later conducted jungle warfare training at Mount Spec, near Townsville. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Davidson took over as commanding officer in September 1942. In January 1943, the brigade was deployed to Milne Bay in New Guinea to take part in operations against the Japanese. The battalion subsequently moved to Buna and Boisi in mid-July, before moving again to Morobe. In August, the 42nd Battalion moved to Nassau Bay, then redeployed to Tambu Bay, fighting during the Salamaua–Lae campaign around Mount Tambu. On 9 September, it secured Charlie Hill, subsequently allowing the capture of Salamaua three days later. In early 1944, the 29th Brigade was involved in clearing the Japanese from Lae alongside the 7th Division. In August, the battalion returned to Australia after 18 months on operations, encamping at Young's Crossing in Petrie, Queensland, for reorganisation after a period of leave. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Byrne took over as commanding officer in September 1944. A patrol from the 42nd Battalion on Bougainville, January 1945. The battalion was subsequently redeployed to Bougainville in December 1944, with the 29th Brigade becoming part of the 3rd Division. Initially deployed in the Southern Sector, the 29th Brigade commenced operations with the 15th Battalion conducting the initial advance down the coast from the Jaba River to the Tavera. The remainder of the brigade, including the 42nd Battalion, commenced operations in January 1945. Entering the abandoned village of Mawaraka on 17 January, the battalion occupied it and then began patrolling forward, frequently clashing with Japanese forces amid the swamps in the area. The 29th Brigade was subsequently relieved by the 7th Brigade and returned to Torokina. In July the 29th Brigade relieved the 15th Brigade along the Mivo River, with the 42nd Battalion taking up positions along the Buin Road, between the Mobiai River and Nana Creek. Meeting strong resistance the brigade advance was held up; however, the Japanese were subsequently cleared and the Silibai River captured on 10 July. The 42nd Battalion subsequently established patrol bases on the Mivo, reaching the Oamai River by the end of July. Hostilities came to an end in August following the Japanese surrender and the demobilisation process began. The 42nd Battalion was disbanded on 7 May 1946. The battalion lost a total of 27 killed and 55 wounded. =Post- war= In 1948, the 42nd Infantry Battalion, The Capricornia Regiment was reformed as part of the re-raised Citizens Military Forces (CMF), with three companies in Rockhampton and its headquarters in Maryborough. In 1960, with the introduction of the Pentropic division into the Australian Army, the CMF was reorganised with the 42nd Battalion was absorbed into the 2nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment (RQR), forming D and E Companies. In 1965, following the abandonment of the Pentropic divisional structure, the 42nd Battalion was re-raised as a full battalion of The Royal Queensland Regiment when 2 RQR was split, with its headquarters, a rifle company, administration company and support company at Rockhampton, a rifle company at Mackay and another rifle company at Gladstone. In 2008, 42 RQR merged with the 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, to become the 31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment as part of the 11th Brigade in the Australian Army Reserve.

Proctor was born in Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. In 1961, she was sentenced to three years at the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario after being convicted of robbery as a teenager. She escaped from the facility on two occasions. After the second escape, Proctor alleges she became a subject in a prison psychology experiment involving the administration of electroshock therapy, sensory deprivation, and LSD. She described the experience as akin to Dante's Inferno. In 1994, Proctor published her autobiography, Chameleon: The Lives of Dorothy Proctor, in collaboration with Fred Rosen, a professor of journalism at Hofstra University. In it she described being involved in prostitution and the drug trade from a young age. She wrote of working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and \\"claims to have played a major role in breaking up Chinese, Jamaican and Europe-to-Canada drug-smuggling rings and exposing corrupt Mounties\\", as well as infiltrating the Mafia and a Sikh terrorist cell. Proctor sued Correctional Service Canada in 1995 for C$5 million in damages. She testified that \\"she was targeted by researchers because she was viewed as a 'throwaway'\\", and that her treatment in prison had resulted in a drug addiction and brain damage. Although Proctor's suit was ultimately settled out of court in 2002, it led to significant media attention on the issue, and a number of former inmates at both the women's prison and the Kingston Penitentiary came forward with similar claims, along with allegations that they had been the subject of clinical pharmaceutical trials. Ultimately, hundreds of prisoners were found to have been subjected to scientific experimentation in Canadian prisons through the 1960s and 1970s.

They are a global network, with think tanks located in Ghana, Cuba, Serbia, Mexico, and El Salvador. Their mission to \\"develop the first world\\" is implemented by finding solutions to problems in Europe and the United States by sending them to their think tanks to analyze. Some themes include immigration, legal waiting zones, and racial profiling. Background The Ghana think tank was founded by Christopher Robbins, John Ewing and Matey Odonkor in 2006. They were later joined by Carmen Montoya in 2009. Christopher Robbins, while working at the Peace Corps in Benin, witnessed \\"first world\\" countries attempting to solve the issues of a culture they were completely unfamiliar with For him, the Ghana Think Tank was initially a response to that experience, turning it upside down and allowing other cultures to find solutions for the United States and their \\"first world\\" problems. One of Ghana Think Tank's earliest projects took place in Providence, Rhode Island. The problems listed varied in importance, from \\"obesity in america\\" and \\"homelessness\\" to \\"I can't dance.\\" Although never implemented, one suggested solution from El Salvador for obesity and homelessness was to hire the homeless, dress them up in fat suits and make them perform social theater to overweight individuals. This proposal was never fulfilled but it was decided after this that the Ghana Think Tank would implement each solution no matter how irrational it may be. Mission  Ghana Think Tank's mission is to \\"develop the first world.\\" The proposed solutions are then implemented seriously whether impractical or not. Some solutions proposed were increasing diversity by hiring immigrant Day Laborers to attend social functions in a wealthy town, recording \\"funny, dirty stories\\" of the elderly to share with younger individuals in order to help bridge generation gaps, and dressing as municipal workers to construct public works projects in Liverpool, UK. One goal of the think tank is to bring awareness to the consequences or potential benefits an outsider can bring. Projects In 2011, Ghana Think Tank was faced with a recurring problem of Latin American Immigrants in Queens being harassed by police officers for loitering. They sent this issue to their think tanks in Ghana, Cuba, and El Salvador. A solution proposed and later implemented were legal waiting zones. The think tank posted up signs and taped the floors where the individuals could loiter freely Summer 2011, The Think Tank collected problems from the Serbs, sending them to the Albanians and vice versa. Since the war in 1999, some people still have not crossed the bridge that separates them but for this project, we convinced them to work with the other side. Some solutions proposed were \\"Albanians and Serbs cooperating to clean up their river so more children will play in it, building a public swimming pool on the main bridge (since it seems to serve more as a symbol or wall than tool for transport), to a free public bus that just drives back and forth to random places in the North and South. \\" Early 2013, Ghana ThinkTank worked as cultural ambassadors in Morocco. Americans submitted questions such as help in building relationship between neighbors that Moroccans helped find solutions for. The think tank traveled through rural villages asking Moroccans for help solving the problems using a solar powered donkey cart that included a video booth. One solution to the afore mentioned problem was to create buildings where neighbors see each other more. Another question submitted was \\"how do you determine the truth?\\" which inspired a conversation with one resident stating \\"the other is hell, but for you (Ghana Think Tank) the other is the solution.\\" February 2014, the Think Tank traveled to Tijuana, Mexico to collect immigration problems and solutions along the Mexico/American border. The problems were collected from Minutemen and Patriot organizations in the United States then were brought to recently deported immigrants at Casa Del Migrantes. The Think Tank also met with Casa Maria del Asunta, home for deported women and children, and Mexican migrant- workers in the San Diego area. Awards On January 10, 2013 Creative Capital announced that the Ghana Think Tank would be receiving a grant award for the category of Emerging Fields. The foundation would grant Ghana think tank over $60,000 in direct financial support and advisory services. Creative Capital’s investment in each project includes up to $50,000 in direct financial support (disbursed at key points over the life of each project), plus more than $40,000 in advisory services, making our total 2013 investment more than $4,140,000. They have also received awards from the Knight Foundation, MIT Community Fund, New York Foundation for the Arts, STEIM, SIGRAPH, and Rhizome Commission. In 2010, Ghana ThinkTank was a finalist for the Frieze Foundation Cartier Award. Exhibitions The Ghana Think Tank has exhibited at the Venice Biennial of Architecture, Museum of Contemporary Art, New Museum Festival of Ideas, FACT - the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology, Museum Arte Util, the Shenzhen and Hong Kong Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture, the Art Museum of the Americas, and the National Museum of Wales.

This is now the central city area of the Perth Metropolitan Region. The 1829 town plan of Perth, Western Australia was an elongated grid pattern that reflected the urban planning principles of the day, and was typical of colonial Williamsburg (1699)Statham, Pamela (1990), The Origins of Australia's Capital Cities, Cambridge University Press, p. 144 and the Edinburgh \\"new town\\" (1768).Proudfoot, Helen (1996). Town plans their impact on the settlement process of Australia (1788 - 1849), Macquarie University, PHD Thesis The plan expressed enlightenment principles, and the ideal of a town conceived as the seat of civic power within a large and productive agricultural hinterland. Contrary to these original ideals, Perth became the commercial center of the colony, and later, metropolitan region, although the town layout itself has remained relatively unchanged to the present day. Instructions for the planning of Perth Land settlement in Australia generally followed the following process: Land was claimed by the crown, then surveyed by the colonial authorities, and either granted, sold or leased to settlers.Siksna, Arnius (2006), The Study of Urban Form in Australia, Urban Morphology (2006) 10(2), pp. 89-100. During the initial stages of settlement and consequent planning, there was no common set of regulations. However, in 1829, as the number of towns began expanding in New South Wales, Governor Darling issued regulations for the dimensions of streets and allotments. These regulations were not in force in Western Australia, but a copy of them was included in George Murray's instructions to Governor Stirling with a comment that they should be adhered to as closely as circumstances would permit. Murray's directives for Perth's town plan were quite general: The chosen site was to be suitable as the seat of government in Western Australia. It was to be surrounded by an area of three square miles as a reserve for future expansion, and allotments within the town were to be granted on only twenty year leases, leaving scope for future developments should they be necessary. Land was to be marked out and reserved for public purposes and all the other requirements essential for the future welfare of the settlement: > In laying the foundations of any such Town, care must be taken to proceed > upon a regular plan, leaving all vacant spaces which will in future times be > required for thoroughfares, and as the sites of Churches, Cemeteries, and > other Public Works of utility and general convenience.Lieutenant-Governor > Stirling's Instructions 30 December 1828 (1828) by George Murray Governor Stirling in turn gave instructions to the Surveyor-General, John Septimus Roe, who was responsible for surveying and laying out of the town site. This work was conducted from a tent camp in the vicinity of the modern Supreme Court gardens in August 1829. 1829 - first town plan 320x320px The first survey was completed in 1829, but was not published in its entirety until 1833. The plan was a semi-regular grid pattern bounded by Mount Eliza to the west, wetlands to the north, and tilted on an angle so that the principle streets ran parallel to the river, which formed the boundary to the south and the east. Stirling's instructions had been to orientate the streets towards the cardinal points of the compass, probably to take advantage of the western sea breeze. Roe, however, chose to run them parallel to the river. To this day the presence of windy conditions in the central city continues to be a problem. 319x319px The basis of the 1829 plan was to have three principal streets parallel to the river, and three running north-south through the existing swamps. Along the length of the river bank ran a long, broad street that was to become the main thoroughfare - St Georges Terrace. It was 99 feet wide, the standard width for a main street in colonial planning. Stretching northwards from the center was another wide street - Stirling Street - that was to be the principal axis for northern expansion of the city. The plan centered on a large open space between Barrack and Pier Streets that was to contain a barracks and parade ground. The land to the west of the barracks was intended for trade and commerce, and in fact remains today as the commercial and financial center of the state economy. To the east of the barracks was the Government domain. Stirling Square was marked out and set aside for a botanic garden. It became a small park, however and King's Park was retained for the display of native flora. =Land use regulations= Building regulations were published with the goal of creating an environment where the buildings had an air of gentility and respectability. Allotments along the most prestigious streets were granted strictly on the basis of social standing. This was done before general applications from settlers could be made. The Town Plan also employed a style of zoning and regulation that marked different blocks for different classes of occupants: :::Section A was designated for government offices. :::Section B for official persons. :::Section C for government employees and Tradesmen. :::Section D for doctors and others connected to the establishment and so on. For example, to be granted land along King George's Terrace required one to construct a house at a minimum cost of 200 pounds, while houses on the secondary streets were to cost at least 100 pounds. In both areas houses were required to be built within two years. By requiring such high building values, and prompt development time, the regulations deliberately excluded those who lacked wealth and social status. An 1833 building code also required houses to be situated: \\"on the middle line of each lot and the front of the building to be 30 feet from the boundary of lot on the street\\".Contained inRegulations Relative to Town and Suburban Allotments, John Septimus Roe, 1833. This was intended to create a more open, spacious environment of detached houses surrounded by trees, orchards and gardens, a contrast to the busy streets, and tightly packed housing, of the urban landscape in the working class city of Fremantle. A visitor to Perth in 1863 noted that in most towns the homes in the best parts of the town stood detached in their own gardens, whereas the appearance of Perth was that: \\"the whole place is rather that of one of those suburbs ... it makes the place much prettier than it would probably be if a larger trade were carried on there.\\"An Australian Parsonage, or the Settler and the Savage in Western Australia(1980), E Millet, Perth: University of Western Australia Press. =Influences= The layout and design of Perth was influenced by the urban planning principles of the time, the colonial experience in Australia and elsewhere, and the practicalities of administrating land grants. Historian Geoffrey Bolton identifies the New Town, Edinburgh as the model for the Perth layout.Geoffrey Bolton, 'Perth, a Foundling City', in P. Statham, pp.144-145. It is probable that this was the case because Governor Stirling was a Scot, and a Scottish influence had already been established with the naming of the city after Perth, Scotland. Between 1752 and 1822, Scottish Edinburgh had been extended in regularly surveyed street blocks that became famous for \\"dignified and orderly planning\\".Patrick Abercrombie and Derek Plumstead, Civic Survey and Plan for the City and Royal Burgh of Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, 1949, pp. 7-11. Although not explicitly acknowledged by them, the extension would have been well known to Stirling and Roe, and exerted an influence over their city design. The town plan also shows the influence of Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia. Founded in 1699, this city was a model for many subsequent colonial capitals. Grid patterns had been appearing quite early in the towns of North and South America, but these were based on the Iberian model of a perfect square.For example, New Haven (1641), Philadelphia (1682), Charlesetown and Savannah (1734) Historian Felicity Morel-Edniebrown suggests that Williamsburg introduced the feature of a long, broad street with key buildings terminating its vistas. Like Perth, the centre of the town was also dominated by a large open space known as Market Square. This square separated the town into two large rectangles, east and west, as the Barracks did in Perth. Also, like Williamsburg, Perth was conceived as the capital of a large and productive hinterland, within which the administrative, institutional, and religious powers of the state resided, where a colonial gentry could maintain social and business ties. That this was the intention was well understood, as reflected by the comments of the naval surgeon T.B. Wilson, who visited Perth briefly in October 1829, and described the intended future of the main street: > the intended principal street of which, named St. George’s terrace, – where > the future beaux and belles of Western Australia may, in after times, show > off their reciprocal attractive charms – was, at present, only adorned with > lofty trees, and a variety of lovely flowers.Quoted by Thomas John Buckton > (1840), Western Australia, a description of the vicinity of Australind, and > port Leschenault\\" 1838 town plan 346x346px The second town plan was published nine years later in 1838, and showed the town expanding to the north through the chain of wetlands and swamps. Although the colonists had initially been disparaging of the swampland, and consequently these areas were avoided in the 1829 plan, they quickly realised that in contrast to much of the soil on the Swan coastal plan, the wetlands were reasonably fertile, and thus highly desirable for market gardening and orchards. Drainage of the swamps commenced in 1833, and continued for 25 years with lots being taken up as water receded. Because of this perceived fertility, interest on the part of the settlers in purchasing swamp soils was keen.Morel-Edniebrown, Felicity, \\"Layered Landscape: The Swamps of Colonial Northbridge\\", Social Science Computer Review, 2009: 27(3), pp. 390-419. Unlike the rest of Perth, the layout of the Northern Streets was decided by the nature of the landscape, the presence of the lakes and wetlands, and the drainage plans. A century later, in 1938, when the early impetus for draining the lakes had been forgotten, Town Clerk W.E. Bold described the missed opportunity that had presented itself in the wetlands: > Opportunities which presented themselves at the beginning of the colony of > laying out an ideal garden city by taking advantage, for ornamental > purposes, of the chain of lakes from the eastern end of the City to Monger’s > Lake in the north-westBold, WE (1938), \\"Perth the first hundred years: the > story of the municipal development of our city\\" See also *Land grants in the Swan River Colony *1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle References Category:History of Perth, Western Australia Category:Urban planning in Australia ","title":"Colonial Town Plans of Perth"},{"id":"41601072","text":"Sharon Riis (1947 - May 20, 2016) was a Canadian novelist, short story writer and screenwriter.\\"Sharon Riis: The Reality Is the Present Tense\\".

Education  Sternfeld was the son of a merchant in Bielefeld, North Rhine-Westphalia. He was educated in a local gymnasium and initially entered university in 1903 to study medicine at Freiburg, but he switched to studying natural science at Bonn. In 1907 he returned to Freiburg, to obtain his Dr. Phil., with a dissertation on the biology of mayflies under the guidance of evolutionary biologist August Weismann.  Museum employment and First World War  Sternfeld's first appointment was alongside herpetologist Gustav Tornier at the Zoological Museum at the University of Berlin. He worked on the herpetofaunas of the German colonies in Africa and the Southwest Pacific, producing 26 titles in 6.5 years. In 1913 he moved to the Senckenberg Museum at Frankfurt to replace herpetologist Philipp Lehrs, and widened his geographical area of interest to include Central Africa, Japan, Australia, the Pacific Islands, and South America. During World War I he was called up for service, serving his country in Macedonia. After the war, Sternfeld clashed with the Director of the Senckenberg and was fired at the end of 1920 after he attempted to unionize museum staff. His replacement was Robert Mertens, arguably Germany's greatest 20th Century herpetologist.  Post-museum employment  Sternfeld was unable to conduct research following his departure from the Senckenberg Museum. From 1923 onwards, he worked as a horse race reporter for the German horse racing newspaper Sportwelt. He developed into a leading and accepted expert in thoroughbred breeding in Germany. In March 1937, Sternfeld lost this job because of his Jewish descent. Since March 1941 he was forced to perform hard labour in Berlin, and on 1 March 1943 he was deported by the Nazis to Auschwitz, where he was murdered later that year.Stolpersteine in Berlin vital statistics  Contributions to herpetology  Between the years 1908-1925, Sternfeld described 42 species of snakes and lizards and five species of frogs that are still recognized today, although only seven of the reptiles retain their original names.

He contributed greatly to the campaigns that allowed Later Shu's founding emperor Meng Zhixiang to control his realm. However, later in his career, he became arrogant and greedy, such that Meng Zhixiang's son and successor Meng Chang and other high-level officials came to see him as a threat to Meng Chang's governance, so they had him arrested and executed.  Background  It is not known when Li Renhan was born, but it is known that he was from Chenliu (陳留, in modern Kaifeng, Henan).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 51. His early career was not well-documented in history, but it is known that he was an officer in Later Tang's army that conquered Former Shu in 925. When, in 926, after the conquest, the Later Tang commander of that invasion army, Li Jiji the Prince of Wei (the son of then-Later Tang emperor Li Cunxu) was prepared to depart Chengdu (the capital of the destroyed Former Shu state) and return to Later Tang's capital Luoyang, he left a detachment, commanded by several officers — Li Renhan, Pan Rensi (), Zhao Tingyin, Zhang Ye (Li Renhan's nephew), Wu Zhang (), and Li Tinghou () — at Chengdu, to await the arrival of the new Later Tang-commissioned military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered at Chengdu), Meng Zhixiang, to arrive. (Apparently, then, when Meng subsequently arrived to take office, Li and those other officers came under his command.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274.  Service under Meng Zhixiang  By 930, the relationships that Meng Zhixiang and Dong Zhang the military governor of neighboring Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) with the imperial government, with Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan as emperor (Li Cunxu's having been killed in a mutiny at Luoyang in 926), had become very strained, and it appeared that war between the imperial government and these two circuits would erupt at any time. At that juncture, there was a time when Li Renhan and Zhang Ye invited Meng to a feast. This led to a rumor, which a Buddhist nun informed Meng, that the two of them were intending to assassinate Meng at the feast. Meng investigated, found no proof of the assassination plot, and eventually discovered that the rumors were being spread by the officers Du Yanchang () and Wang Xingben (). He put Du and Wang to death by cutting them in halves at the waist. He then proceeded to attend the feast at Li's house without any guards accompanying him. Li, in gratitude for this show of trust, knelt down to him and cried, stating, \\"This old soldier can only die to repay your grace.\\" It was said that this incident led the generals to have greater attachment to Meng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In fall 930, Meng and Dong formally rose against the imperial government. Meng sent Li to command the army against the imperially-held Wuxin Circuit (武信, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan), with Zhao Tingyin serving as his deputy and Zhang serving as his forward commander. Li shortly after put Wuxin's capital Sui Prefecture () under siege, with the imperial general Xia Luqi () the military governor of Wuxin defending. When Xia sent his officer Kang Wentong () out of the city to battle Li, Kang, hearing that the previously-imperially held Baoning Circuit (保寧, headquartered in modern Nanchong, Sichuan) had already fallen to the joint Dongchuan/Xichuan army, surrendered to Li. In spring 931, Sui Prefecture fell to Li; Xia committed suicide. Meng then commissioned Li as the acting military governor of Wuxin, and sent him with a fleet east to try to capture the Three Gorges region from defending imperial generals. Li quickly captured Zhong () and Wan () Prefectures (both in modern Chongqing), and then approached Kui Prefecture (夔州, also in modern Chongqing). The imperially- commissioned military governor of Ningjiang Circuit (寧江, headquartered at Kui), An Chongruan () abandoned Kui and fled back to secure imperial territory, allowing Li to take control of Ningjiang. He remained in the region for some time, and in winter 931, he returned to Chengdu. By this point, the imperial government had effectively capitulated, as Li Siyuan had withdrawn the main imperial army against the two circuits, commanded by his son-in-law Shi Jingtang, and had executed his chief of staff An Chonghui, the main proponent for the campaign against the two circuits. Li Siyuan sought rapprochement with the two circuits, and Meng wanted reconciliation with the imperial government, but Dong did not, and instead attacked Xichuan. Meng's counterattack defeated Dong (with Zhao Tingyin playing a large part in the Xichuan victory), and Dong's officers subsequently killed him and surrendered Dongchuan to Meng. Li subsequently rendezvoused with Zhao at Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (), and Zhao personally went to welcome Li's arrival. Instead of acknowledging Zhao's accomplishments in defeating Dong, however, Li insulted Zhao, causing Zhao to become resentful of him. When Meng himself subsequently arrived at Zi as well, he summoned Li and Zhao, asking them which of the two of them would be suitable to be the military governor of Dongchuan, believing that one of them would support the other, he was surprised that Li only made the comment of, \\"Even if you, Lord, want to give me Shu Prefecture [(蜀州, in modern Chengdu — which Li might have one point served as the prefect of)] again, I will accept it\\" and that Zhao was completely silent. Subsequently, with the two of them at a standoff, Meng decided to assume the military governorship of Dongchuan himself to avoid having Li and Zhao continue to struggle over it. He subsequently commissioned Li as the full military governor of Wuxin, and Zhao the military governor of Baoning.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. In 934, Meng claimed imperial title as emperor of a new state of Later Shu. He made Li Renhan one of the generals commanding his imperial guards, but continued to let Li also serve as the military governor of Wuxin. It was said that many senior Later Shu generals at that time were arrogant and pillaging the people, often abusing the law to seize people's good fields and even destroying tombs, with Li and Zhang Ye being among the worst offenders. Li had used these tactics to become very wealthy. He had also wanted to marry a concubine of a Former Shu emperor who was very beautiful, but was concerned that Meng would rebuke him for doing so, and therefore did not do so.  Death  Meng Zhixiang died later in 934, leaving a will for his son Meng Renzan (who then changed his name to Meng Chang) to succeed to the throne, and entrusting Meng Chang to the chancellor Zhao Jiliang, Li Renhan, Zhao Tingyin, the chief of staff Wang Chuhui, and the imperial guard generals Zhang Gongduo and Hou Hongshi (). (Upon Meng Zhixiang's death, Wang, who served inside the palace, immediately informed Zhao Jiliang, but when Zhao then sent him to inform Li, Wang was intimidated by the fact that Li only agreed to see him after surrounding himself with guards, and therefore did not immediately inform Li at that time, until Meng Chang had taken the throne.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Immediately after Meng Chang's assumption of the throne, Li Renhan insisted on being put in command of the imperial guards. Meng Chang initially reluctantly agreed and put him in command, making Zhao Tingyin his deputy. Meng Chang also gave him the honorary chancellor designation Zhongshu Ling (). However, Zhang Gongduo and several of Meng Chang's close associates thereafter accused Li Renhan of plotting treason. After consulting with Zhao Jiliang and Zhao Tingyin, Meng decided to arrest him while he was attending an imperial meeting, and then put him to death, along with his son Li Jihong () and several associates. (Shocked by the development, the senior general Li Zhao (), who had previously refused to bow to the young emperor, changed his attitude and became very submissive. Meng's associates advocated putting Li Zhao to death, too, but Meng did not do so, instead forcing Li Zhao into retirement.)

The book uses biographies of individual Americans as a means of discussing important forces in American history from 1978 to 2012, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the decline of American manufacturing, and the influence of money on politics. The Unwinding includes lengthy profiles of five subjects: a Youngstown, Ohio factory worker turned community organizer, a biodiesel entrepreneur from North Carolina, a Washington lobbyist and Congressional staffer, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel, and people involved in the distressed housing market in Tampa, Florida. Interspersed with these longer accounts are ten briefer biographical sketches of famous Americans such as the rapper Jay-Z, the politician Newt Gingrich, and the restaurateur and food activist Alice Waters. In an interview with PBS NewsHour, Packer defined the book's theme as the unraveling of > \\"a contract that said if you work hard, if you essentially are a good > citizen, there will be a place for you, not only an economic place, you will > have a secure life, your kids will have a chance to have a better life, but > you will sort of be recognized as part of the national fabric.\\" The Unwinding follows the decline of a number of American institutions that Packer believes underpinned this contract, including locally owned businesses, unions, and public schools. According to Packer, the \\"void\\" left by the decline of these institutions \\"was filled by the default force in American life, organized money.\\" The book's format and style were inspired by John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy, a series of novels published in the 1930s. Like The Unwinding, the U.S.A. trilogy combined longer narrative accounts of its main characters with short biographies of influential figures of the time period and collections of newspaper headlines and song lyrics. The Unwinding won the 2013 National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award. Contents=Jeff Connaughton= Jeff Connaughton began a decades-long affiliation with Senator Joe Biden in 1979 when, as a student at the University of Alabama, he invited the Senator to speak to a campus group. Connaughton was so impressed by Biden that he committed to working for Biden if the Senator ever ran for President. After earning an M.B.A. degree and working for a few years in the financial industry, Connaughton joined Biden's 1988 presidential campaign as a fundraiser. After the campaign imploded, Connaughton found a job on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He later worked for Abner Mikva in the White House Counsel's office during the Clinton administration. Although Connaughton was identified in Washington as a \\"Biden guy\\" he was deeply disappointed with what he perceived as ingratitude by Biden - for instance, the Senator refused to call Mikva to recommend Connaughton. Still, after leaving the White House, Connaughton parlayed his connections into a career as a lobbyist for the firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates, representing clients such as Laurent Gbagbo, the President of the Ivory Coast. Connaughton held frequent fundraisers for politicians in order to gain access to their offices. When Biden became Vice President and Ted Kaufman, Biden's former Chief of Staff was appointed to fill Biden's Senate seat, Connaughton went to work for Kaufman. Together, Kaufman and Connaughton worked on reform of the financial services industry in the wake of the Great Recession. They encouraged criminal prosecution of financial fraud cases as well as limits to the size of banks, but met with limited success. Connaughton found that the lobbyists he used to work with had better information and more input on financial reform regulation than he had as a Senate aide. Connaughton believed that advocates for U.S. financial system reform, such as the group Americans for Financial Reform, were being overwhelmed by industry lobbyists. After Kaufman's term ended, Connaughton, disillusioned with Obama/Biden and Washington, moved to Savannah, Georgia and published a memoir of his experiences, The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins. A version of this section of The Unwinding was published in The New Yorker, where Packer is a staff writer. =Dean Price= Dean Price came from a family of tobacco farmers in the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina. A devotee of the self-help books of Napoleon Hill, Price opened a number of fast-food restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations along U.S. Route 220. Price witnessed the decline in the 1990s of all three of the region's important industries: tobacco, textiles and furniture. After Hurricane Katrina led to diesel shortages, Price became enamored with the idea of biodiesel. He believed that biodiesel, made from locally-grown crops, could help struggling local farmers while also avoiding what he believed would be the catastrophic consequences of peak oil. With partners, Price founded a business that would refine locally-grown canola into biodiesel, which was then sold at Price's gas stations. This was the first establishment of its kind in the country and it attracted the attention of the local Congressman, Tom Perriello and the Obama Administration. However, Price's restaurants and gas stations failed amidst the Great Recession and Price lost control of the biodiesel company. After these failures, Price began a new venture: using used cooking oil from restaurants to provide fuel for local school buses. =Tammy Thomas= Tammy Thomas is an African American woman from Youngstown, Ohio. The child of a heroin addict, she was raised by her great-grandmother, a maid. Thomas witnessed the dramatic consequences of the collapse of Youngstown's steel industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The city's population declined from 140,000 in 1970 to 95,000 in 1990 (it was about 67,000 in 2010) and crime increased precipitously. Despite becoming a mother as a teenager, Thomas was the first member of her family to graduate from high school. Determined not to become dependent on welfare, in 1988 she got a union job at a Packard Electric plant that made automotive parts for General Motors. The job enabled Thomas to become a homeowner and send her three children to college. In 2006 Packard Electric's successor company, Delphi Automotive, announced that it would close most of its American plants, including those in Youngstown, as it shifted production to Mexican maquiladoras. Thomas took a buyout offer from Delphi. Thomas found a new job as a community organizer in Youngstown, recruiting local residents to advocate for neighborhood improvement and mapping the city's many abandoned properties. =Shorter biographical sketches= In addition to the longer portraits of ordinary Americans, The Unwinding also includes shorter biographical sketches of the following influential figures: *Newt Gingrich *Oprah Winfrey *Raymond Carver *Sam Walton *Colin Powell *Alice Waters *Robert Rubin *Jay-Z *Andrew Breitbart *Peter Thiel *Elizabeth Warren Reception Writing in The New York Times Book Review, columnist David Brooks praised the book's narratives as \\"beautifully reported\\" and \\"vivid snapshots of people who have experienced a loss of faith\\", but criticized Packer's lack of analysis. According to Brooks, the book's \\"lack of a foundational theory of history undermines the explanatory power of The Unwinding\\".

He is now remembered as a librettist. Life The son of the Rev. John Dalton, rector of Dean, Cumberland, he was born there; Richard Dalton was his brother. He received his school education at Lowther, Westmorland, and when sixteen years old was sent to The Queen's College, Oxford, entering the college as batler 12 October 1725, being elected taberdar 2 November 1730, and taking the degree of B.A. on 20 November 1730. Shortly afterwards he was selected as tutor to Lord Beauchamp, the only son of the Earl of Hertford, later Duke of Somerset. Ill- health prevented Dalton from accompanying Lord Beauchamp on travels through Europe, ending in his death at Bologna in 1744. Dalton proceeded to his degree of M.A. on 9 May 1734, and on 21 April in the next year was allowed to accept a living from Queen's; his election to a fellowship there followed on 28 June 1741. For some time he was an assistant preacher under Thomas Secker, at St. James's, Westminster. Through the Duke of Somerset's influence he was appointed canon of the fifth stall in Worcester Cathedral in 1748, and about the same time obtained the rectory of St. Mary-at-Hill in the City of London. Dalton took the degrees of B.D. and D.D. on 4 July 1750. He died at Worcester on 22 July 1763, and was buried at the west end of the south aisle of Worcester Cathedral, where a monumental inscription was placed to his memory. Horace Walpole asserted in correspondence that both Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough and her friend Frances Seymour, then countess of Hertford, had had affairs with Dalton. When Dalton was a tutor to the Hertfords, Lady Luxborough's husband Robert Knight, Baron Luxborough did find love letters from Henrietta to Dalton, accused her of becoming pregnant by him, and arranged a separation. Works=Comus libretto= Dalton's libretto for the Comus of Thomas Arne was published as Comus, a Mask, now adapted to the Stage, as alter'd, from Milton's Mask (1738). It was a significant version of the original masque, Comus by John Milton. The insertion of songs and passages taken from other poems of Milton, and the addition of several songs of his own, developed the Comus in a way still to the taste of Henry John Todd a century later. The Arne-Dalton Comus kept its place on the stage for many years, and in 1750 Dalton saw it was performed as a benefit for Elizabeth Foster, a granddaughter of Milton, supported by Samuel Johnson and David Garrick among others. It was supplanted on the stage around 1772, by George Colman's abridgment. The published version was twice reprinted in London in 1738, and once pirated in Dublin. The sixth impression bore the date of 1741; it was often reissued until 1777, and was included in Bell's British Theatre, and other collections. =Other works= Dalton's first work was the anonymous An Epistle to a Young Nobleman from his Preceptor, 1736. It was republished in Two Epistles, the first to a Young Nobleman from his Preceptor, written in the year 1735–6; the second to the Countess of Hartford at Percy Lodge, 1744, London 1745. Both of them are included in George Pearch's Collection of Poems, i. 43–64. Dalton was also the author of A Descriptive Poem, addressed to two ladies at their return from viewing the mines near Whitehaven, to which are added some Thoughts on Building and Planting, to Sir James Lowther, 1755, with notes on the mines by his friend, William Brownrigg. Most of the Descriptive Poem was printed with the notes in William Hutchinson's History of Cumberland, and both of the poems were in George Pearch's Collection. Dalton's verses on \\"Keswick's hanging woods and mountains wild\\" were praised in Thomas Sanderson's Poems (Carlisle, 1800), pp. 84, 226–7. Dalton's published sermons were: *Two Sermons before University of Oxford at St. Mary's, 15 Sept. and 20 Oct. 1745; on the Excellence of an Oxford Education. *Religious Use of Sickness; a Sermon preached at Bath Abbey Church for the Infirmary, 8 Dec. 1745. *Sermon before University of Oxford at St. Mary's, 5 Nov. 1747. *Sermon preached at St. Anne's, Westminster, 25 April 1751, for Middlesex Hospital. Remarks on XII. Historical Designs of Raphael and the Musæum Græcum et Ægyptiacum, or Antiquities of Greece and Egypt, illustrated by prints intended to be published from Mr. Dalton's drawings (1752) was promotional material for Richard Dalton, his brother. Family Dalton's wife was a sister of Sir Francis Gosling, an alderman of London. She long survived him, and, on the death in 1791 of her brother-in-law Richard, she obtained an accession to her income.

In electrochemistry In electrochemistry, concentration polarization denotes the part of the polarization of an electrolytic cell resulting from changes in the electrolyte concentration due to the passage of current through the electrode/solution interface.S.P. Parker, McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific & Technical Terms 6E, 2003. Here polarization is understood as the shift of the electrochemical potential difference across the cell from its equilibrium value. When the term is used in this sense, it is equivalent to “concentration overpotential”.A.J. Bard, G.R. Inzelt, F. Scholz (Eds.), Electrochemical Dictionary, Springer, Berlin, 2012.J. Manzanares, K. Kontturi, In: Bard A.J., Stratmann M., Calvo E.J., editors. In Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry, Interfacial Kineticsand Mass Transport, VCH-Wiley, Weinheim; 2003. the changes in concentration (emergence of concentration gradients in the solution adjacent to the electrode surface) is the difference in the rate of electrochemical reaction at the electrode and the rate of ion migration in the solution from/to the surface. When a chemical species participating in an electrochemical electrode reaction is in short supply, the concentration of this species at the surface decreases causing diffusion, which is added to the migration transport towards the surface in order to maintain the balance of consumption and delivery of that species. Fig. 1. Fluxes and concentration profiles in a membrane and the surrounding solutions. In Fig. a, a driving force is applied to a system initially at equilibrium: the flux of a selectively permeating species in the membrane, J_1^m, is higher than its flux in solution, J_1^s. Higher flux in the membrane causes decreasing concentration at the upstream membrane/solution interface, and increasing concentration at the downstream interface (b). Concentration gradients gives rise to diffusion transport, which increases the total flux in solution and decreases the flux in the membrane. In steady state, J_1^s=J_1^m. In membrane science and technology In membrane science and technology, concentration polarization refers to the emergence of concentration gradients at a membrane/solution interface resulted from selective transfer of some species through the membrane under the effect of transmembrane driving forces.E.M.V. Hoek, M. Guiver, V. Nikonenko, V.V. Tarabara, A.L. Zydney, Membrane Terminology, in: E.M.V. Hoek, V.V. Tarabara (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Membrane Science and Technology, Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, 2013, Vol. 3, pp. 2219–2228. Generally, the cause of concentration polarization is the ability of a membrane to transport some species more readily than the other(s) (which is the membrane permselectivity): the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface while the concentration of transported species decreases. Thus, concentration polarization phenomenon is inherent to all types of membrane separation processes. In the cases of gas separations, pervaporation, membrane distillation, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration separations, the concentration profile has a higher level of solute nearest to the upstream membrane surface compared with the more or less well mixed bulk fluid far from the membrane surface. In the case of dialysis and electrodialysis, the concentrations of selectively transported dissolved species are reduced at the upstream membrane surface compared to the bulk solution. The emergence of concentration gradients is illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b. Fig. 1a shows the concentration profile near and within a membrane when an external driving force is just applied to an initially equilibrium system. Concentration gradients have not yet formed. If the membrane is selectively permeable to species 1, its flux (J_1^m) within the membrane is higher than that in the solution (J_1^s). Higher flux in the membrane causes a decrease in the concentration at the upstream membrane surface (c_1') and an increase at the downstream surface (c_1), Fig. 1b. Thus, the upstream solution becomes depleted and the downstream solution becomes enriched in regard to species 1. The concentration gradients cause additional diffusion fluxes, which contribute to an increase of the total flux in the solutions and to a decrease of the flux in the membrane. As a result, the system reaches a steady state where J_1^s=J_1^m. The greater the external force applied, the lower c_1^\\\\prime. In electrodialysis, when c_1' becomes much lower than the bulk concentration, the resistance of the depleted solution becomes quite elevated. The current density related to this state is known as the limiting current density.H. Strathmann, Ion-Exchange Membrane Separation Processes, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2004 p. 166 Concentration polarization strongly affects the performance of the separation process. First, concentration changes in the solution reduce the driving force within the membrane, hence, the useful flux/rate of separation. In the case of pressure driven processes, this phenomenon causes an increase of the osmotic pressure gradient in the membrane, which reduces the net driving pressure gradient. In the case of dialysis, the driving concentration gradient in the membrane is reduced.R.W. Baker, Membrane Technology and Applications, John Wiley & Sons, 2012. In the case of electromembrane processes, the potential drop in the diffusion boundary layers reduces the gradient of electric potential in the membrane. Lower rate of separation under the same external driving force means increased power consumption. Moreover, concentration polarization leads to: * Increased salt leakage through the membrane * Increased probability of scale/fouling development Thus, the selectivity of separation and the membrane lifetime are deteriorated. Generally, to reduce the concentration polarization, increased flow rates of the solutions between the membranes as well as spacers promoting turbulence are applied [5, 6]. This technique results in better mixing of the solution and in reducing the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer, which is defined as the region in the vicinity of an electrode or a membrane where the concentrations are different from their value in the bulk solution. In electrodialysis, additional mixing of the solution may be obtained by applying an elevated voltage where current-induced convection occurs as gravitational convection or electroconvection. Electroconvection is defined R.F. Probstein, Physicochemical Hydrodynamics, Wiley, NY, 1994. as current-induced volume transport when an electric field is imposed through the charged solution. Several mechanisms of electroconvection are discussed.I. Rubinstein, B. Zaltzman, Electro-osmotically induced convection at a permselective membrane, Physical Review E 62 (2000) 2238.N.A. Mishchuk, Concentration polarization of interface and non-linear electrokinetic phenomena, Advances in Colloid and Interface Science 160 (2010) 16.V.V. Nikonenko, N.D. Pismenskaya, E.I. Belova, P.

Tanaka, Ion Exchange Membranes: Fundamentals and Applications, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2007. In dilute solutions, electroconvection allows increasing current density several times higher than the limiting current density. Electroconvection refers to electrokinetic phenomena, which are important in microfluidic devices. Thus, there is a bridge between membrane science and micro/nanofluidics.J. De Jong, R.G.H. Lammertink, M. Wessling, Membranes and microfluidics: a review, Lab on a Chip—Miniaturisation for Chemistry and Biology 6 (9) (2006) 1125.

The company closed operations in 2016. History SABMiller has an investment in the company while it was within the jurisdiction of Sudan. It built a ~£32 million factory in Juba, making it the first manufacturing facility in the country and came despite competition from imported beers from Kenya and Uganda. The initial plans to start a brewery had begun in 2006 before the launch in 2009. The company's initial challenges included logistics as material to build the first factory needed to be driven into the country from Mombasa, Kenya including two second hand brewery machines from Malta and Bulgaria and a power plant needed to be built, while the only ingredient of beer available was local water from the Nile and the over 250 workers who had mostly never been employed before needed to be trained from scratch. The malted barley, hops and yeast are imported but there were plans to work with local farmers to start brewing with cassava. The factory has a capacity to produce 180,000hl of clear beer and 60,000hl of carbonated soft drinks annually. The flagship White Bull's colours are yellow, green and white and are served in heavy brown bottles. It is also illegally available in Khartoum, Sudan. Production started in May 2009. Ian Alsworth- Elvey is the inaugural managing director of the company. A new Managing Director, Carlos Gomes was appointed to take over the business in March 2015. This was, however, not the first attempt to build a brewery in the country after Belgium's SYBETRA built the White Nile Brewery in Wau in 1983, but the Sudanese government did not license the project due to sharia law. Brands The beer brands that were manufactured are White Bull, Nile Special (brewed primarily in Jinja, Uganda but also at the South Sudan brewery) and Club Pilsner pale lager beer. The Company also produces soft drinks such as Club Cola, Club Berry, Club Lemmon,Club Pineapple, Club Orange, and Club Apple . In addition to soft dinks and beer, the Company also produces spirits such as Konyagi Gin, Vladimir Vodka, Regency Whisky and Valeur Brandy. =White Bull Lager= A White Bull bottle Southern Sudan Beverages Ltd. announced on May 6 2009; that the company had produced its first locally produced beer in South Sudan, called White Bull Lager with an alcohol content level of 4.2%. The beer has been brewing in the Juba brewing facility, which SSBL invested US$37 million in 2009 that has an initial annual capacity of 180000hl. The White Bull name comes from the distinctive cattle in the country which, according to the company, \\"is an important culturally treasured symbol status that the team at SSBL respects and admires.\\" Since the brands inception, WB is considered to be the national beer of South Sudan. The brewery planned to produce 35 million litres a year. Bulk purchases are sold at Sudanese pounds per crate except for volume buyers — with purchases of 225 crates or more — who will pay about UK£12, while the minimum order is 45 crates. By May 11th 2010 it was announced White Bull had captured two-thirds of the mainstream beer market, selling 2.5m bottles a month, at 70p each.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/11/sudan-south-thirst-beer On January 14 2016, the company had announced it would be closing its brewing operations in South Sudan by mid-February due to the foreign-currency shortage restricting its ability to import raw materials.http://hotinjuba.com/ssbl-to- stops-producing-white-bull-in-south-sudan/ ReferencesExternal links * Official SABMiller site for White Bull Category:Breweries of Africa Category:SABMiller Category:Companies of South Sudan Category:Companies established in 2009 Category:Organisations based in Juba ","title":"Southern Sudan Beverages Limited"},{"id":"41601392","text":"Short for Something is the third album by the New Klezmer Trio, Ben Goldberg - clarinet, Dan Seamans - bass, and Kenny Wollesen - drums, which was released on the Tzadik label in 2000.Tzadik catalogue accessed January 10, 2014 Reception In his review for Allmusic, Stacia Proefrock observed \\"Their music is fully embedded in modern creative avant-garde jazz, yet still manages to nod its head to the sounds of old Cracow, creating a cauldron of spiritual yearnings, sadness, chaos, visions, and grace\\".

The Metropolitan Police have acknowledged it was born of other investigations, but describe it as a new strategic approach to corruption, rather than a single operation. The Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee has published a redacted copy of a summary of the investigation, with a lengthy annexe detailing other earlier corruption investigations, especially Operation Russell. It investigated the charge that certain \\"organised criminals\\" were able to infiltrate Scotland Yard by bribery. 19 former and 42 then serving officers were investigated for alleged corruption. It has been claimed that the Metropolitan Police suffered “endemic corruption” and given the small number of convictions, doubt has been expressed over whether this police force has extirpated the problem. According to The Independent, the gangs used their contacts inside Freemasonry to “recruit corrupted officers”. The report concluded that this was one of “the most difficult aspects of organised crime corruption to proof against”. Allegations of evidence tampering, interference with the pursuit of criminal suspects by other forces, and close cooperation between senior police officers and master criminals, particularly those involved in illicit drugs and prostitution, have been raised. Charges that jurors were bought off or threatened to return not-guilty verdicts, corrupt individuals working for HMRC, both in the UK and overseas, and “get out of jail free cards” being bought for £50,000 are also cited in the report. John Palmer ('Goldfinger') protected by corrupt officers One of the highest- ranking gangsters in the UK, John Palmer, was alleged by The Times from Operation Tiberius files, to have been protected from arrest and investigation by a clique of high-ranking corrupt Metropolitan Police officers. Palmer's companions were once discovered with a silenced Uzi submachine gun and 380 rounds of ammunition. Panorama (BBC programme) On 29 February 2016, the BBC screened an edition of Panorama entitled \\"Cops, Criminals, Corruption: The Inside Story\\". It covered police corruption, including material uncovered by Operation Tiberius. However, there was no mention of the manner in which contacts were established and maintained between senior police officers and criminals. In particular, there was no mention of the involvement of Freemasonry, in contrast to The Independent article and what had been leaked from the Operation Tiberius report.

Early life Hammurabi was the son of the Aleppan king Yarim-Lim I, and his mother was queen Gashera. His private secretary as a crown prince was Sin-Abushu and is known from the tablets of Mari. Nothing else is known about him before he ascended the throne, following the death of his father in ca. 1764 BC. Reign Yarim-Lim I left the kingdom on the height of its power and Hammurabi was among the strongest kings of his age, with no threats to his power as his father had made alliances with Babylon and Eshnunna and eliminated the danger coming from Qatna. At the beginning of his reign, Hammurabi I sent troops to aid the Babylonian king Hammurabi against Siwe- Palar-Hupak of Elam who invaded Babylon. Amut-Pi-El of Qatna tried to form an alliance with the Elamite king, but Zimri-Lim of Mari warned Hammurabi I and the Elamite envoys were captured on the borders as they were trying to return to Elam. After defeating Elam, Hammurabi I sent Hammurabi of Babylon troops to aid him against Larsa. The kingdom of Yamhad was of the same status as Babylon, evidenced by Hammurabi of Babylon's treatment of Yamhad's envoys which caused the delegates of Mari to complain. The fact that Zimri-Lim became king with the help of Yamhad meant that Mari was a semi-client state of Yamhad, and in the correspondence between Zimri-Lim and Hammurabi's father Yarim-Lim I, the king of Mari calls Yarim-Lim his father. This situation helped Yamhad's trade because of Mari's location between Babylon and Aleppo. On one occasion, Hammurabi sent an army of 10,000 troops to aid Zimri-Lim. Yamhad's lordship over Mari was so strong that the king of Ugarit asked Hammurabi to intermediate with Zimri-Lim to let him visit the famous Palace of Mari. The political - military alliance with Babylon ended with Hammurabi of Babylon invading Mari and destroying the kingdom in ca. 1761 BC, however economical relations continued as Babylon did not advance into Aleppo territory. The invasion of Mari had a negative impact on trade between the two kingdoms, as the road became dangerous because of the loss of Mari's protection to the caravans crossing that road. Later in Hammurabi I's reign, the city of Carchemish came under Yamhad's domination. Death and Succession Hammurabi I gave his son Yarim-Lim the city of Irridu. He died ca. 1750 BC and was succeeded by his other son Abba-El I. Another son called Nakkusse appears in the Tablets of Alalakh, holding a high position in its court.

Point process notation Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying mathematical space. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually d-dimensional Euclidean space denoted here by \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ d}, but they can be defined on more abstract mathematical spaces. Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation. For example, if a point \\\\textstyle x belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by \\\\textstyle {N}, then this can be written as: : \\\\textstyle x\\\\in {N}, and represents the point process being interpreted as a random set. Alternatively, the number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} located in some Borel set \\\\textstyle B is often written as: : \\\\textstyle {N}(B), which reflects a random measure interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably. Definitions=Nearest neighbor function= The nearest neighbor function, as opposed to the spherical contact distribution function, is defined in relation to some point of a point process already existing in some region of space. More precisely, for some point in the point process \\\\textstyle {N}, the nearest neighbor function is the probability distribution of the distance from that point to the nearest or closest neighboring point. To define this function for a point located in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d at, for example, the origin \\\\textstyle o, the \\\\textstyle d-dimensional ball \\\\textstyle b(o,r) of radius \\\\textstyle r centered at the origin o is considered. Given a point of \\\\textstyle {N} existing at \\\\textstyle o, then the nearest neighbor function is defined as: : D_o(r)=1-P({N}(b(o,r))=1\\\\mid o). where \\\\textstyle P({N}(b(o,r))=1\\\\mid o) denotes the conditional probability that there is one point of \\\\textstyle {N} located in \\\\textstyle b(o,r) given there is a point of \\\\textstyle {N} located at \\\\textstyle o. The reference point need not be at the origin, and can be located at an arbitrary point \\\\textstyle x\\\\in\\\\textbf{R}^d. Given a point of \\\\textstyle {N} existing at \\\\textstyle x, then the nearest neighbor function, is defined as: : D_x(r)=1-P({N}(b(x,r))=1\\\\mid x). Examples Mathematical expressions of the nearest neighbor distribution only exist for a few point processes. =Poisson point process= For a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the nearest neighbor function is: : D_x(r)=1-e^{-\\\\Lambda(b(x,r))}, which for the homogeneous case becomes : D_x(r)=1-e^{-\\\\lambda b(x,r)}, where \\\\textstyle b(x,r) denotes the volume (or more specifically, the Lebesgue measure) of the (hyper) ball of radius \\\\textstyle r. In the plane \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^2 with the reference point located at the origin, this becomes : D_x(r)=1-e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\pi r^2}. Relationship to other functions=Spherical contact distribution function= In general, the spherical contact distribution function and the corresponding nearest neighbor function are not equal. However, these two functions are identical for Poisson point processes. In fact, this characteristic is due to a unique property of Poisson processes and their Palm distributions, which forms part of the result known as the Slivnyak–Mecke or Slivnyak's theorem. =-function= The fact that the spherical distribution function Hs(r) and nearest neighbor function Do(r) are identical for the Poisson point process can be used to statistically test if point process data appears to be that of a Poisson point process. For example, in spatial statistics the -function is defined for all ≥ 0 as: : J(r)=\\\\frac{1-D_o(r)}{1-H_s(r)} For a Poisson point process, the function is simply = 1, hence why it is used as a non-parametric test for whether data behaves as though it were from a Poisson process. It is, however, thought possible to construct non-Poisson point processes for which = 1, but such counterexamples are viewed as somewhat 'artificial' by some and exist for other statistical tests. More generally, -function serves as one way (others include using factorial moment measures) to measure the interaction between points in a point process.

In August and September 1962, Saint Germain was chartered to Townsend Thoresen for use on the Dover - Calais route. On return to SNCF, she was put into service on the Dunkerque - Harwich route. With the introduction of IMO Numbers in the late 1960s, Saint Germain was allocated the IMO Number 5305895. On 6 February 1967, she struck the lock gates at Dunkerque and was damaged. In 1976, Saint Germain was transferred to the Dunkerque - Dover route. Her passenger capacity was increased to 1,000. On 21 February 1979, she collided with the Liberian bulk carrier , killing two people and injuring four more. She was repaired at Dunkerque, returning to service operating a reduced speed.

Parentage Her mother, née Angelica Pelissary or Pillesary She was the only daughter of Henry, Viscount St John, by his second wife, Angelica Magdalena, daughter of Georges Pillesary, treasurer-general of the marines, and superintendent of the ships and galleys of France under Louis XIV. Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, was her half-brother. Marriage On 20 June 1727, Henrietta St John married Robert Knight of Barrells Hall, Warwickshire. The marriage fell under an early cloud when her husband suspected her of an affair with her physician, Charles Peters. Horace Walpole describes her as wearing a portrait of her husband in her hair. Another suspicion caused the breakdown of the marriage. John Dalton was a tutor in the household of the Hertfords, where Frances Seymour, Countess of Hertford, was Henrietta's friend. Knight found love letters from Henrietta to Dalton, accused her of becoming pregnant by him, and arranged a separation, in 1736. Later life Henrietta Knight went to live on her husband's estate at Barrells Hall, which she had laid out in the artificial style of landscape gardening. Here she was within easy reach of her friend and correspondent William Shenstone, whom she frequently visited at The Leasowes, and with whom she kept up a regular correspondence. Shenstone celebrated their somewhat artificial Arcadia in his ode on Rural Elegance, addressed to the Duchess of Somerset (1750). Another friend was the poet William Somervile. Dying towards the end of March 1756, Henrietta Knight and was buried in the church of Wootton Wawen; her remains were later removed to a mausoleum near Barrells Halls. She had been assumed to share her half-brother's atheism, but took the sacrament on her deathbed. Works Lady Luxborough's Letters to William Shenstone, Esq. were published by Robert Dodsley, London, 1775. Four poems, printed as \\"by a lady of quality\\" in Dodsley's Collection of Poems by several hands (1775), iv. 313, are attributed to her by Horace Walpole. Other correspondence appeared in Thomas Hull's Select Letters between the late Duchess of Somerset, Lady Luxborough … and others, London, 1778, 2 vols. Family By Lord Luxborough, she had a son, Henry, who married, 21 June 1750, a daughter of Thomas Heath of Stanstead, Essex, and died without issue in the lifetime of his father. There were also two daughters, one of whom married a French count. The other, Henrietta, married Charles Wymondesold of Lockinge, Berkshire. Eloping in 1753 with Josiah Child, son of Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney, she was divorced, and married her lover on 7 May 1754.

He was popular with Sarajevans and was known by all as \\"Čika Mišo\\" (Uncle Mišo). Background and personal life Uncle Mišo was born Husein Hasani in 1931 in Uroševac, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He had eight or nine siblings, and was the last living of all the Hasani children. He was an ethnic Kosovar Roma and moved to Bosnia with his family as a teenager in 1946, just after the end of World War II. The nickname Mišo was given to him by his Hungarian boxing coach, who could not pronounce his name. He had said that his true love was boxing. His wife, Džemila, predeceased him. Shoeshiner In 1952, Mišo took over the job of shoe-shiner from his father, a job he would keep until his death six decades later. He was the last one to keep up with the traditional trade, which has deep roots in Bosnia, inherited from the centuries-long Ottoman rule of the region. His original \\"base\\" was in front of the Marijin Dvor building. He later moved himself to Marshal Tito Street, about twenty years before his death. He sat on his chair on the sidewalk throughout the Siege of Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995, avoiding sniper fire. During the war years, he could hardly be convinced to move to a shelter during the shelling. Despite food shortages and poverty during the war, he always kept treats for Sarajevo's stray dogs, which he called his \\"faithful comrades\\" in the streets. In 2009 Mišo was awarded a medal for merit by city authorities, as well as an apartment and a pension. In an interview, he said: \\"There were shoe-cleaners in every street when I started and now, I'm the only one, why? Because I have been brave and people laughed at my jokes.\\" Death Uncle Mišo died of a heart attack in the morning hours of 6 January 2014 at the age of 82. The mayor of Sarajevo Ivo Komšić called Misho a \\"symbol of the city\\" of Sarajevo and stated that his death had left the city \\"emptier\\". Upon his death, the chair where he sat daily was adorned with candles, roses and shoes by passers-by. He was buried in a graveyard in Vlakovo on 8 January 2014. The day after his death, a petition calling for a memorial to be placed in the spot where he sat everyday was started on Facebook. On 11 January 2014, the workers of the McDonald's fast food restaurant in front of the spot where he worked paid for and set up a commemorative plaque that reads: \\"Here worked čika Mišo, the last shoe-shiner in Sarajevo.

The complex and random patterns are unique, and modern hardware and software can detect and differentiate those patterns at some distance from the eyes.  Introduction  The veins in the sclera—the white part of the eyes—can be imaged when a person glances to either side, providing four regions of patterns: one on each side of each eye. Verification employs digital templates from these patterns, and the templates are then encoded with mathematical and statistical algorithms. These allow confirmation of the identity of the proper user and the rejection of anyone else. Advocates of eye vein verification note that one of the technology's strengths is the stability of the pattern of eye blood vessels; the patterns do not change with age, alcohol consumption, allergies, or redness. Eye veins are clear enough that they can be reliably imaged by the cameras on most smartphones. The technology works through contacts and glasses, though not through sunglasses. At least one version of eye vein detection uses infrared illumination as part of the imaging, allowing imaging even in low-light conditions.  History  Dr. Reza Derakhshani at University of Missouri, Kansas City, developed the concept of using the veins in the whites of the eyes for identification. He holds several patents on the technology, including a 2008 patent for the concept of using the blood vessels seen in the whites of the eye as a unique identifier. More recent research has explored using vein patterns in both the iris and the sclera for recognition.  Uses  Eye vein verification, like other methods of biometric authentication, can be used in a range of security situations, including mobile banking, government security, and in healthcare environments. EyeVerify, a Kansas City, Kansas, company, markets eye vein verification with a system called Eyeprint. In 2012, EyeVerify licensed the technology developed and patented by Derakhshani. And Derakhshani now serves as chief science officer of EyeVerify.  Advantages  * Eye vein patterns are unique to each person * Patterns do not change over time and are still readable with redness * Works with contacts and glasses * Resistant to false matches  Disadvantages  * Phone must be held close to face * Not supported on devices without cameras or on older smartphones  See also  * Iris recognition * Finger vein recognition * Fingerprint recognition * Biometrics * Voice recognition * Access control  References  Category:Biometrics software Category:Authentication methods Category:Veins Category:Human eye ","title":"Eye vein verification"},{"id":"41601928","text":"Michael Carabello (born November 18, 1947) is an American musician.

Military career In 1980, he attended the Military Academy of Venezuela. =1992 coup attempt= During the February 1992 coup attempt carried out by Hugo Chávez, Rodríguez Torres took part in the conspiracy.Reuters sobre Rodríguez Torres Chávez's goal, assisted by Cuban president Fidel Castro, was to capture and kill President Carlos Andrés Pérez and then establish former president Rafael Caldera into the presidency. Rodríguez Torres, an army captain at the time, was given the task of capturing and killing President Pérez after another coup conspirator refused to participate after discovering that Rafael Caldera would be placed as president. President Pérez, who had recently arrived from Davos, learned of the coup threat upon his return, leaving the airport in a concealed fashion which surprised Rodríguez Torres, who quickly pursued the fleeing president with his fellow militants, firing at his vehicle. Ultimately, the coup failed and the conspirators, including Rodríguez Torres, were imprisoned. After being jailed for 25 months, Rodríguez Torres was released in 1994 through an act of amnesty by Caldera, who had just been elected president. Political career Rodríguez Torres was director of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service, Venezuela's intelligence services, from 2002 to 2013. Following the election of Nicolás Maduro into the presidency in April 2013, Rodríguez Torres was made the Minister of the Popular Power for Interior, Justice and Peace.

Days later on 24 October 2014, Rodríguez Torres was removed from his position during a state-run television program. Among other Venezuelan officials, he is banned from entering Colombia. The Colombian government maintains a list of people banned from entering Colombia or subject to expulsion; as of January 2019, the list had 200 people with a \\"close relationship and support for the Nicolás Maduro regime\\". Dissident As of 2017, Rodríguez Torres had been an increasingly vocal critic of the government, alongside dissident chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega Díaz. In May, news outlets reported that he was considering a bid for the presidency, offering a 'third way' or middle ground between the opposition and Chavismo. In June 2017, he expressed his opposition to the presidential initiative to convene a National Constituent Assembly, and called instead for the scheduling of new elections. =Arrest= On 13 March 2018, Rodríguez Torres, who had spoken the previous day at an opposition rally, was arrested by SEBIN agents and brought to the Dirección General de Contrainteligencia Militar headquarters in Sucre, Miranda.

Standing on the site of a building from the Middle Ages, it was designed by Walter Görig (1885–1974) and completed in 1928. Its elegant Art Deco design and excellent acoustics have been praised by a number of artists including Herbert von Karajan. History In the Middle Ages, an octagonal bell-shaped building (hence its name) belonging to the cathedral chapter stood south of the cathedral on the Domsheide in the Dombezirk, an enclave under the sovereign and legal control of the cathedral. It was the venue for the meetings of the chapter and, from 1648, for the deliberations of the court. In 1737, a new octagonal building was constructed on the site, coming under the authority of the City of Bremen in 1803. From 1857, it belonged to the Künstlerverein (Artists Association). After a fire in 1915, the old Glocke building was demolished, making way for a new concert hall with the same name, designed by Walter Görig (1885–1974) and completed in 1928. Built of dark brick with limited use of stone, the building's imposing stepped gable faces the Domsheide while the facade overlooking the Grasmarkt has modestly designed oriel bays in deference to the cathedral. The building underwent comprehensive refurbishment between 1995 and 1997 when the architects Gerhard Müller-Mencken and Klaus Rosenbusch combined the need for preservation with the demands of a modern concert hall. While maintaining the hall's unique acoustics, they restored the original Art Deco finish and installed up-to-date technical equipment. The hall's elegant Art Deco design and excellent acoustics have been praised by a number of artists including the conductor Herbert von Karajan, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Gidon Kremer. Karajan rated this hall as in the top three in Europe. The paintings by Karl Dannemann illustrating the Saga of the Bell in the restaurant date from the opening of the new building in the late 1920s. Organ The organ was built by Wilhelm Sauer from Frankfurt an der Oder in 1928. It has 76 registers, four manuals and a pedal. In 2008, Christian Scheffer completed a major restoration, reconstructing the original pneumatic action, now electrically powered. Presentations In addition to classical concerts, Die Glocke is used for a variety of presentations including jazz concerts, cabaret, drama and lectures as well as special events for families and children. The large hall (Großer Saal) seats 1,400 while the small hall (Kleiner Saal) with 395 seats can also be used for receptions and meetings.

Wilcox and starring Shelley Winters, Keenan Wynn, Dewey Martin, and Charles Bronson (credited as Charles Buchinsky). Mounted as a title to fill out double and triple bills (a B-movie), Tennessee Champ was one of several films Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shot in its pet process of Ansco Color, a ruddy- looking process employed on the same year's Brigadoon. The film marked a return to Hollywood for star Shelley Winters, who hadn't appeared in a film in almost two years because of her marriage to Vittorio Gassman (which ended in June 1954) and the birth of their child, Vittoria. The lull came just as she seemed to be on an upswing after roles in Winchester '73 (1950), Phone Call from a Stranger (1952), and her breakthrough tragic performance in A Place in the Sun (1951).  Plot  Sarah Wurble's husband Willy is the larceny- inclined manager of an illiterate, and very religious boxer from Tennessee named Danny. Gifted with a powerful punch and a nickname that gives the film its title, Danny mistakenly believes he killed a man defending himself in a street brawl, and goes on the lam as a prizefighter. His Christian convictions turn out to be both a source of inspiration and, ultimately, conflict when Willy urges him to throw a fight (while mistakenly fearing Willy will turn him in on the murder charge if he doesn't). Credulity flies out of the window when Danny discovers the man he is to take on in the fixed fight is actually the man he thought he killed, Sixty Jubel, The \\"Biloxi Blockbuster.\\" Danny's example of unwavering faith causes Willy to rethink his sinful ways. Cast * Shelley Winters as Sarah * Keenan Wynn as Willy * Dewey Martin as Danny * Charles Bronson as Sixty (billed as Charles Buchinsky) * Yvette Dugay as Blossom * Earl Holliman as Happy Reception According to MGM records the film earned $555,000 in the US and Canada and $214,000 elsewhere, making a loss to the studio of $189,000.

He enrolled in the Accademia Ligustica of Fine Arts in 1842, and studied under the vedutista Domenico Pasquale Cambiaso. Among his influences were that of the Swiss Alexandre Calame, the Bellunese Ippolito Caffi, and later (1854–1857) in Luxoro's career, Antonio Fontanesi. Among Luxoro's colleagues in landscape painting were Ernesto Rayper, Alfredo d'Andrade, and the Spaniards Serafino D'Avendano and Alberto Issel. Together they began to frequent the studio of Carlo Pittara at Rivara Canavese, where a group of painters met and loosely constituted the so-called School of Rivara, consisting of mainly Ligurian and Piedmontese landscaper painters.F. Franco, Treccani entry. One of his pupils was Aurelio Craffonara. In 1849 he helped found the Società Promotrice di Belle Arti in his hometown.

In order to carry this out this Department established a system whereby every person returning to Australia from war was registered: the completed registration form stated whether or not the member was fit enough to resume former duties and provided the basis for the Department to liaise with employers; *to restore to the fullest degree of efficiency possible, by means of vocational training, those who on account of war service were unable to follow pre-war occupations, and to grant them adequate sustenance during that time.

Background Eleanor was one of three daughters of Thomas St Clere and his wife Margaret Hoo. Thomas had no son, so his daughters were co-heirs to the extensive properties that he held at the time of his death in 1435. Records of the investigations that took place after then are not totally consistent about Eleanor’s age but indicate that she was the second of the daughters and about 11 or 12 years old when her father died.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery), Vol. 8, Nos. 114-117. This makes 1423 her approximate year of birth. Thomas held much of his lands direct from the King, as tenant-in-chief. As a result, the wardship of all the property and control of the marriages of his heirs belonged to the King. However, during his lifetime, Thomas had transferred much if not all of his lands to trustees, apparently with a view to depriving the King of these benefits.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery), Vol. 8, Nos. 114-117. Marriage and family Eleanor married Sir John Gage, son of John Gage and his wife Joan Sudgrove. It is quite feasible that the marriage took place in 1438, when John (the son) and his widowed mother conveyed their lands to trustees. John and Eleanor were definitely married by 16 December 1445, when the properties that had been held by her father were released by the King who had evidently asserted his rights despite Thomas' attempts to frustrate them. By that stage, all three of Thomas' daughters were married.Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Reign of Henry VI, Vol. 4, page 443. Sir John and Eleanor were the parents of: * William Gage * John Gage Property A deed dated 8 July 1446 set out the agreed partition of Thomas St Clere’s lands between his three daughters along with their respective husbands.

Marco Lusini (Siena 8 September 1936 - Florence 3 October 1989) was an Italian artist who worked in painting, sculpture, photography, and poetry. Born in Siena, he attended art school before relocating to Florence in 1960. Here, he involved himself in the \\"Bazzechi\\" photographic studio before becoming well known as a painter. He actively contributed to the city's cultural life, thereby becoming a friend and collaborator to such writers and poets as Mario Luzi, Alessandro Parronchi, Elvio Natali, Piero Santi, Elio Filippo Accrocca, Enzo Carli, Alfonso Gatto, Giulio Guberti, Franco Solmi, Carlo Segala, and Claudio Spadoni. He achieved fame throughout Italy and internationally. Italian poet Mario Luzi opined that the \\"intense figurations of extraneousness and undeception\\" of Lusini's earlier work allowed the viewer to \\"let us know him\\". Luzi contrasted this with some of Lusini's later work, which he thought carried with it \\"a new utmost feeling of expectation and perhaps even something more... the very acute sense of the imminence of a final event\\". The art critic Elvio Natali noted that the \\"one unfailing subject\\" which recurred throughout Lusini's work was \\"The human image, whether it is a woman's image or a man's image, often asexual, as a symbol of a common, undifferentiated destiny.\\" He nevertheless noted that Lusini's work went through several cycles, among them \\"Lovers\\", \\"Mysterious figures\\", \\"Homage to Brecht\\", \\"Object Woman\\", and \\"Oneiric Landscapes\\". In 1978, Lusini exhibited his work in Miami, Florida. Following Lusini's death, Gerhard Gruitrooy devoted his paper on Giovanni Battista Naldini to Lusini's memory in volume seventeen of The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal.

The middle section between Bünde and Rahden is a single-track branch line, the southern section between Kirchlengern and Herford is also single-track, but has been electrified. Both parts are now operated as the Ravensberger Bahn (Ravensberg Railway), which continues to Bielefeld. The northern section of the line from Rahden to Bassum is closed except for a short section between Barenburg and Sulingen, which is used only for freight traffic.  History  The first plans were published for a branch line from the Hamm–Minden railway of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company from Minden via Lübbecke to Osnabrück in about 1845. These found no support in conservative circles. In 1867, a new project was presented for a line on the Karlshafen–Herford–Bünde–Lübbecke–Lemförde route. More concrete plans were published on 5 March 1872 for a line from Bünde to Rahden, branching off the Löhne–Rheine railway, which was opened on 21 November 1855. But planning for a single-track branch line from Bünde to Rahden was finally approved by the Prussian minister for public works in 1892. Five years later, on 22 February 1887, ground was broken and, on 30 September 1899, the first services were operated on the railway by two special trains, which could be used free of charge. The Prussian state railways began regular operations the next day. By 29 September 1900, the line had been extended to the north-east to Sulingen and from 1 August 1901 there were continuous services from Bünde via Rahden and Sulingen to Bassum on the Bremen–Münster main line. On 1 July 1904 the line was extended to the south with the construction of a single-track connection between Kirchlengern and Herford on the Hamm–Minden railway, using the tracks of the Löhne–Rheine line from Bünde to Kirchlengern. This section of the line, unlike the northern section, was electrified in the 1970s to allow electrically-hauled traffic to transfer between the two main lines. The electrification was completed on 20 September 1976. Further branch lines were built. The first section of the Wittlage District Railway (Wittlager Kreisbahn) from Holzhausen-Heddinghausen to Bohmte with a connection to the Münster–Osnabrück–Bremen main line, was opened on 9 August 1900, and the Nienburg–Rahden railway was opened on 15 January 1910. Subsequently the engine shed in Rahden was extended and the locomotive depot became a locomotive workshop. The Second World War also left its mark. On the night of 1/2 April 1945, the bridge was over the Mittelland Canal between Gestringen and Luebbecke was blown up. But through traffic was able to run on 1 March 1946. From January 1950 express trains from Bremerhaven-Lehe to Frankfurt via Bremen, Herford, Paderborn, Korbach and Marburg used this route. This service was also called an Heckeneilzug (“hedgerow express”). The last steam train ran as a shuttle between Sulingen and Bünde on 5 and 6 October 1974. Sulingen station on the last day of operations (1 June 1994) On 1 June 1994, the last remaining pair of trains ran on the Bielefeld–Bassum–Bremen route and therefore all passenger traffic ended between Rahden and Bassum. The carriage of freight ended on 3 June 1994, except on the Sulingen–Barenburg section. DB Schenker Rail Deutschland has continued to operate traffic on the section of the line from Diepholz via Sulingen to Barenburg for ExxonMobil. There are plans to create a connecting curve at Sulingen between the lines to Diepholz and Barenburg, providing a bypass of Sulingen. The grounds of the disused Sulinger station with its formerly extensive track systems would be redeveloped. The remaining line was closed on 31 December 1997. Between Sulingen and Schwaförden (March 2012) A bottleneck in the federal trunk road network (B61) was eliminated at the existing railway overpass at Bassum with the partial removal of the embankment in the autumn of 2009. In Ströhen a hall has been built over the track. In the Sulingen area several level crossings were eliminated, in some cases during the construction of relief roads. The level crossing on the B61 in Neuenkirchen has also been removed. The other sections are now mostly overgrown with scrub. Nevertheless, the Verein Aktionsbündnis Eisenbahnstrecke Bassum-Bünde, founded in 2010, has submitted a plan for the reactivation of the line. Passenger services on the Bünde–Rahden section are now operated as part of Deutsche Bahn’s Münster-Ostwestfalen (MOW) regional network, based in Münster.  Current operations  Eurobahn-Talent in Rahden station Lübbecke station The route between Rahden and Herford is served by Regionalbahn service RB 71 (Ravensberger Bahn) train at hourly intervals on working days with trains crossing in Holzhausen-Heddinghausen at the symmetry minute of 28 minutes past the hour; on Sundays services run every two hours. The trains continue to Bielefeld Hbf and from there operate as the RB 67 (Der Warendorfer) to Münster Hbf so that a change of trains is only necessary when rollingstock are replaced. The service is operated by Eurobahn with Bombardier Talent diesel railcars at speeds of up to 120 km/h. The whole line can be used with the Sechser-Tarif (“the six” fares) of the Zweckverband Verkehrsverbund OWL (transport association of Ostwestfalen-Lippe) and the NRW- tariff (fares) of North-Rhine Westphalia. =Freight traffic= The short central section between Sulingen and Barenburg is now used for freight transport by DB Schenker Rail for traffic running between Diepholz and the facilities of the ExxonMobil company at Barenburg. In Lübbecke a siding branches off to the BESTA company near the Mittelland canal. This siding is used regularly. Part of this traffic consists of trains carrying wire rolls to the BESTA site. = Draisine operations = Between Rahden and Ströhen there is now a Draisine operation for tourists. Ströhen includes a well-developed tourist railway, which also operates Draisines on a former narrow-gauge railway used for peat extraction on Neustädter Moor.

Early life Paul Dessau was born in London, the third of four children. His father died when he was young and he did not do well at school. On leaving school he joined a commercial art studio as an apprentice, mostly doing catalogue work for department stores. In due course, he left to start his own design studio with his brother Bernard, who was also known as Dewsbury Dessau. Whilst continuing to work, Paul Dessau began to study part-time at the Hornsey School of Art and then took anatomy classes at the Central School of Art and Design and eventually began to show works at various London galleries. World War II G V Blackstone, GM, London Fire Force (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 1356) At the start of the Second World War Paul Dessau, and his brother Bernard, joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, which in 1941 became the National Fire Service. A number of artists had joined the NFS and a firemen artists' committee was formed which included Bernard Hailstone, Leonard Rosoman, Norman Hepple and Robert Coram as well as Dessau. The NFS agreed to assist the artists as long as their fire-fighting duties were not adversely affected and the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, agreed to consider purchasing any works produced. In time, WAAC were to purchase at least two paintings by Dessau. As well as contributing to both WAAC and specialist civil defence art shows, the firemen held several of their own exhibitions. In 1941, the Firemen Artist Group attracted some 64,000 people in a month to the first of twenty exhibitions they were to hold at the Cooling Galleries. In addition, four firemen artist exhibitions were held at the Royal Academy and then toured around Britain during the war whilst a further two exhibitions toured America and Canada. Several works by Dessau featured in these wartime exhibitions including And So To Bed, showing a carefully laid-out uniform of an auxiliary fireman, and several fine portraits including one of Divisional Officer Blackstone, who was awarded the George Medal for his actions after a fire station was bombed during the Blitz. Menace is a set of four canvases, now in the London Fire Brigade Museum, entitled Overture, Crescendo, Rallentando and Diminuendo, which show fire-fighters tackling a giant demonic fire figure which towers over them in the first canvas, Overture, but lies defeated in the final Diminuendo. Dessau also contributed illustrations to the 1942 NFS anthology Fire and Water, to the 1943 WAAC booklet Air Raids and to a 1943 book on firemen co-written by Stephen Spender. Later life After the war Dessau, and his wife whom he had married in 1935, moved out of London and settled in the country, where he pursued a career as a successful portrait painter. He was also an accomplished, and largely self-taught, pianist and, less successfully, an inventor of household gadgets.

On St Kilda, the drystone walls are distinctive for their lack of coursing and seemingly random stone placement - this was deliberate, to ensure that the wind could pass through and thus help to preserve food stores kept there.St Kilda Rangers tweet 28 July 2018 Occasionally the entrance is found in a side wall. Examples also exist of cleitean built perpendicularly to the direction of the slope, with the entrance in one of the narrower ends. In order to be able to withstand any downward thrust, the end facing downhill is normally built in the shape of an apse with a strong support. Entrances are very rarely placed in the apsidal end, in order not to compromise its strength.

Life Hastings's Seagulls Over Sorrento made theater history by running for 1,551 performances at London's Apollo Theatre. Only two other plays had then run longer in theater history: Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit; and R. F. Delderfield's Worm's Eye View. Part of the play's appeal was that it was radical for the time. The play was set inside a Royal Navy research station near Scapa Flow. The play was not popular with everyone, and not everyone saw the humor in it. It elicited subdued laughs as well as frowns, depending on whether the audience was liberal or conservative. He estimated he made ₤50,000 from Sorrento. The fortune grew to £100,000 when in 1954 a film version made by the Boulting brothers was released. Hastings has an uncredited movie role in the 1952 film The Gift Horse, on which he worked on the script.

It currently operates as the \\"Grand Victorian Bed and Breakfast.\\" It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Henry Richardi was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania in 1863, the son of Robert and Louisa Richardi. When Henry was young, his family moved to Louisiana, Missouri, where his father started a wooden utensil company. Henry went to school there, and began helping his father in the business. In 1881, Robert Richardi decided that the area around Bellaire was more promising, so the family moved again, and established the company of Richardi & Bechtold (later the Woodenware Company) with Frederick Bechtold. Henry Richardi continued to work in the business, and in 1895, Robert Richardi sold out to his son. By 1900, the company employed nearly 100 people, but in 1905 a fire destroyed the plant. It was not rebuilt, and Richardi & Bechtold went out of business. Richardi used some of the land to set up an electric plant, supplying electricity to nearby Charlevoix; much of the rest is now a city park. This house was built in 1895 for Henry Richardi, reportedly in an attempt to woo a young woman for a wife. The house was built by Richardi's employees to reflect the quality of their craftsmanship, and the economic success of Richardi's company. However, Richardi's marriage plans never came to fruition, and he never lived in the house. Richardi eventually moved to California in 1925.

Description The Henry Richardi House is a 2-1/2-story asymmetrical wood frame Queen Anne house sitting on a rough stone foundation. The plan includes a number of elegant bays, balconies, and overhangs created by the second-story gables, and a square tower with a curved, pointed roof surmounts the structure. The house is covered with clapboard and scalloped wooden shingles. It features a significant amount of ornamental detail, including lathe-turned beaded latticework and columns.

It was levied against employers at a flat rate of per man, and per woman. SET was intended to subsidise manufacturing industry from the proceeds of the services industries, to help exports. At the end of each accounting period, manufacturing companies would have their SET payments refunded, along with a 7s 6d bounty per employee. SET was designed to be a tax on those companies that did not boost UK exports. High-street bookmakers used the introduction of this tax as a reason to reduce the payout on some each-way bets (where a horse is placed in the first two or three, depending on the number of runners) from a quarter the odds to a fifth the odds.

A passing family, the Ferbers, are traveling by wagon. They meet Corey, who explains that he is homesteading, not squatting, and entitled to the property.

Her husband Louis is taken captive by Avery, who tortures and kills him, refusing to believe the truth that Corey is alone. Avery's men realize he is insane and intend to leave, so Avery destroys their water supply. Corey's water is now the only one within hundreds of miles.

Keighley RLFC Cockroft made his début for Keighley on 12 February 1938 in the away fixture to Newcastle and marked the occasion by scoring an injury-time try to level the scores in the 6-all drawn game. He later formed a formidable partnership with Welsh rugby union convert Ken Davies who played at Stand-off half.

Plot It’s a Dog’s Life is narrated by Wildfire (voiced by Vic Morrow) a dog bull terrier who betters the life of the affluent family that adopts him. At the turn of the century, he and his mother roam the streets of New York for food and shelter. Wildfire soon becomes curious about his past and seeks answers from a knowledgeable old neighborhood dog, who informs him that his father, Champion Regent Royal — supposedly a prize- winning fighter dog—abandoned his mother while she was pregnant. Wildfire resolves to track down his father and kill him, just before discovering that his mother has mysteriously vanished. Now on his own, the determined stray sets out on his quest for honor and winds up in the dangerous Bowery district, where he becomes a successful pit fighter at a saloon. Wildfire flourishes under the expertise of a ruthless hustler named Patch McGill (Jeff Richards), but his winning streak comes to an abrupt end when his master greedily matches him against a much larger dog; McGill blames Wildfire for the loss, prompting the dog to return to the waterfront. Fortune strikes when an admirer of Wildfire’s—animal caretaker Jeremiah Nolan (Edmund Gwenn) — brings the dog back to his quarters at a massive countryside estate owned by a self-made millionaire (and dog breeder), Mr. Wyndham, played by Dean Jagger. Bitter over his own failing health, Wyndham initially opposes the presence of the “mongrel,” but his daughter Dorothy (Sally Fraser), recognizes the dog’s beauty and convinces her father to let him stay if he qualifies for a ribbon at a local dog show. Wildfire falls in love with a fellow contender named Miss Ladyship, and not only qualifies but goes on to win first prize at the competition. It turns out his father was not a fighter but a renowned show dog, and Wildfire is a chip off the old block. Wyndham subsequently warms to the fearless dog, admiring his courage, and learns to enjoy life again by accepting his own mortality. Dorothy enters Wildfire in the Grand National Championship at Madison Square Garden, where the hero faces his destiny by competing against Regent Royal. Wildfire wins once again, but decides not to kill his father, having been touched by his Regent Royal’s gracious acceptance of defeat. A dog riot breaks out when Wildfire defends his father from heckling canines; thinking he has disgraced the Wyndhams, the hero flees the scene and subsequently becomes trapped by dogcatcher, one who coincidentally has Wildfire’s mother in his wagon. Wyndham arrives on the scene and buys Wildfire and his mother from the dogcatcher. Back at the estate, Regent Royal reunites with Wildfire’s mother and escaped pageant contestant Miss Ladyship goes on to give birth to a litter of Wildfire’s puppies.

Louis Duchesne (1902), \\"Les évèchés de Calabre,\\" In 597 Pope Gregory instructed the Bishop of Reggio and the Bishop of Lipari to come to Rome. Whether this was Paulinus, or a successor in the diocese of Lipari, is unknown. Lipari is a volcanic island. Its last major eruption took place in 729, leaving a high pumice cone which is 476m (1570 feet) high; the population must have fled, at least temporarily. One crater, called Monte Pilato, is mined for pumice and has numerous caves.Anachronistically, Monte Pilato figures in the romance of Agatho, the purported first bishop of the island in the 260's. There are still hot springs and fumaroles. In 1544 the pirate Barbarossa completely depopulated the island. It was at the direction of the Emperor Charles V, who noted the island's strategic position, that it was repopulated. In 1743, the city of Lipari had about 13,000 inhabitants, under the temporal authority of the King of Naples. The diocese was directly subject to the authority of the Pope, that is, Lipari had no regional Metropolitan. The Cathedral had a Chapter which contained four dignities (Archdeacon, Deacon, Cantor, Treasurer) and fifteen Canons.Ritzler, VI, p. 263 note 1. Rodriquez, p. 36. On September 30, 1986, as part of a Vatican effort to reduce the number of redundant Italian dioceses, the diocese of Lipari was suppressed as an independent entity and incorporated into the Archdiocese of Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela. Bishops=to 1500= *[Agatho (c. 254)]Agatho's name appears in the Acts of St. Alphius and companions, in Acta Sanctorum Maii Tomus II, pp. 531 and 536. He is said to have fled from the island of Lipari to Sicily in the face of persecution by one Diomedes; there he was taken in by a Christian Dometius, who related the story of Alphius and his companions and the persecutor Tyrtullus, who had killed them at Taurominium. After Tyrtullus' death, Agatho was led to a cave where he identified the bodies of Alphius and his companions. The story is a Christian romance, as the editors of the Acta Sanctorum repeatedly indicate (pp. 502-506). Ughelli, pp. 773-774.

Early life Charles Tooth was born 14 February 1831 in Cranbrooke, Kent. He was the son of Robert Tooth (1799–1867) and Mary Ann Reader (c. 1801 – 1845). He married Eliza Tabberer (died 1892) in 1855. Tooth became managing partner of the Tooth Brothers' brewery (later Crescent Brewery) in Burton upon Trent in 1855. This was founded mainly to export beer to the business run by his brothers Robert (1821–1893), Edwin and Frederick in Sydney, Australia where demand for beer had increased as a result of the Australian gold rushes. It closed after financial problems early in the next decade. He was author or coauthor of patents related to brewing. Ministry Tooth was admitted as a fellow-commoner to Downing College in 1860 and graduated from the University of Cambridge with a B.A. in 1864. He was ordained deacon in 1863 and priest in 1864 (his brothers Arthur and William Augustus also studied at Cambridge and were ordained in the same year). He served as curate in Uxbridge (then in Middlesex) 1863–65, was perpetual curate of St George's Falfield, Gloucestershire 1865–71, vicar of Grandborough, Warwickshire 1871–72 and rector of St. Mark’s Snow Hill in Shelton, Staffordshire 1872–75. Tooth moved to Tuscany for health reasons in 1876, where he was the Anglican chaplain in Siena. He founded St Mark's English Church as an independent house church in Florence in 1877 for which he purchased new premises which opened in 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. He remained chaplain of St Mark's until 1894. Legacy Tooth married Louisa Janette Anne Edwards (died 1899) in 1894. He died the same year, on 2 August 1894 in Gibraltar. His widow commissioned the building of St Mark's Church, Brithdir in his memory. It was designed by Henry Wilson in the style of the Arts and Crafts movement. Building started in 1895 and the church was consecrated in 1898. It is designated a Grade I listed building by who describe it as \\"an exceptionally important and advanced work for its date\\".

ScreenOnline notes that the film \\"spent ten wordless minutes subtly conveying a couple's fear in the face of an incoming nuclear blast.\\" The film won the Hiroshima Peace Prize. The film had an estimated budget of £125,000 The short was made in Bristol. The title of the short came from David Anderson \\"going to a carol concert in Bristol with the composer Martin Kiszko and listening to 'Oh Little Town of Bethlehem\\". =Paradise Regained (1986)= Paradise Regained was directed by Andrew Franks. The film had an estimated budget of £80,000. =Conversations by a Californian Swimming Pool (1986)= Conversations by a Californian Swimming Pool was directed by Andrew Franks.

Shape note composer Alexander Johnson set it to his tune \\"Jefferson\\" in 1818, and as such it has remained in shape note collections such as the Sacred Harp ever since. However, the hymn is most often set to the tune of Joseph Haydn's \\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\\" (referred to in hymnals as \\"Austria\\"). In recent decades it has been sometimes replaced by \\"Abbot's Leigh\\". This was written for this text by The Reverend Cyril Vincent Taylor in 1942 while he was a producer of Religious Broadcasting at the BBC and stationed at the village of Abbots Leigh. Multiple other tunes have also been used with the hymn. Joseph Haydn  History  The hymn was written by Newton after he had asked for assistance from his friend and neighbour, classical writer William Cowper, while he was the Church of England parish priest of Olney Church. With Cowper's assistance, Newton was able to publish the Olney Hymns Hymnal, which included \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\", in 1779. The hymn is based upon Psalm 87:3 and Isaiah 33:20–21. \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\" is considered to be Newton's best composition and was the only joyful hymn in the publication. The hymn has five verses of eight lines each. The hymn was a favourite of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. He is noted to have once awakened his soldiers in 1862 while they were in the Shenandoah Valley by singing \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\" out of tune.  Tune (Austria)  Because of the practice of singing the hymn to a tune used for other purposes it has sometimes elicited unusual reactions. In 1936, the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Joachim von Ribbentrop gave a Nazi salute in Durham Cathedral when the hymn was played and had to be restrained by the Marquess of Londonderry. During the Second World War in an Oflag prisoner of war camp, a Protestant service was interrupted during the singing of \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\" by the camp guards singing Sei gesegnet ohne Ende, because the hymn was set to the same tune. The same Haydn melody is employed in the German national anthem formerly known, popularly, as Deutschland über alles — properly titled Das Lied der Deutschen or the Deutschlandlied, the third verse of which is the national anthem of present- day Germany. For some people, using this particular tune for the hymn (often named in various hymnals as \\"Austria\\") is often controversial as, despite the fact that it dates back to the 18th century, it raises reminders of Nazi Germany. Cyril Vincent Taylor's Abbot's Leigh tune was written in response to complaints received by the BBC during the war. Below, a setting of the hymn as it appears in the Army and Navy Hymnal (1920): \\\\version \\"2.16.2\\" \\\\header { tagline = ##f } \\\\score { << << ew Staff \\\\with {midiInstrument = #\\"oboe\\"} { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\relative c' { \\\\repeat unfold 2 { 4\\\\. 8 4  << { g8 [ e ] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { e4 } >> 4   << { a8 [ f ] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { d8 [ f ] } >> 2 \\\\break } 4 8 << { c4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { c4 } >>  4 8 << { c4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { c4 } >>  4 << { bes'4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { d,8 e } >> 4\\\\. 8  **4. **8 2  4\\\\. 8 4  4\\\\. 8 << { c8 [ bes ] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g4 } >> 4  << { a8 [ bes ] c [ d ] bes [ g ] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { e4 f d } >>  4 << { a8 g } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { e4 } >> 2 \\\\bar \\".\\" } } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { \\\\set stanza = #\\"1.\\" Glo4. -- rious8 things4 of thee are spo -- ken, Zi -- on, cit -- y of our God;2 He,4. whose8 word4 can -- not be bro -- ken, Form'd thee for his own a -- bode;2 On4 the Rock of A -- ges found -- ed, What can shake4. thy8 sure4. re8 -- pose?2 With4. sal8 -- va4 -- tion's walls4. sur8 -- round4 -- ed, Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.2 } ew Staff \\\\with {midiInstrument = #\\"oboe\\"} { \\\\clef bass \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\relative c { \\\\repeat unfold 2 { 4\\\\. 8 4   << { bes4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { bes4} >> 4  ** 2 } 4  8 **4 << { g'4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { bes, 8 a } >> 4\\\\. 8  << { g4. } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g4. } >> 8 2  4\\\\. 8 << { bes4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { bes4 } >> 4  << { bes4. } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { bes4. } >> 8 4  << { c'8 [ f, ] g [ bes ] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { a,4 bes } >>  4 2 } } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 4 = 72 } }  Usage  The hymn is used by a wide range of Christian denominations, including Catholics. Words of the hymn may be changed depending on, for example, whether the congregation is Calvinist or Lutheran. Presbyterians often sing only three verses of the hymn.

Overview In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) Vivartavada (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance). There is also the fourth, Pratityasamutpada-vada, the theory of dependent origination of Buddhism. According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School, also accepted by the Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta, causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parinama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or Prakrti. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of Brahman. Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the Monotheistic Schools’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from Vivartavada, the Monistic Schools’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman. Arambha-vada The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the Nyaya School, which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter- entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada. Brahman as the cause The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of Pradhana or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction. Sat-Karya-vada According to this philosophy, which follows from Sat-Karya-vada, the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its Shakti (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects. Prakrti is orderly. The Ṛta (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub- systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in Indian philosophy to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum. The Svetasvatara Upanishad says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the Brahma Sutras base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात्  (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च  (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च  (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36). Tantra view Tantra has influenced the Hindu, the Buddhist and the Jain traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of Abhasavada or Pratibimbavada, explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three- folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature. Vivartavada Gaudapada treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. Badarayana also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by Adi Sankara, to whom owing to Maya the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality. Vidyaranya reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम्  - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form (Panchadasi 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”. it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles avidya, the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”. Criticism Both, Parinama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. Madhava rejects Bhaskara on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. Ramanuja accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.

It was introduced as the new flagship of Nautor in 1973. At the time of its launch it was the largest GRP constructed yacht in the market and because of its excellent racing history, one of the most famous Swan models ever built. The first 65-footers were delivered to owners in 1973, and the production continued until 1989 with 41 hulls being built in total. The yacht was designed by Sparkman & Stephens which was considered by many, the number one yacht design company at the time. Swan 65 was designed to I.O.R Mk III to fulfil the continuously increasing demand for bigger sailing/racing yachts in the market. In order to meet this demand Nautor had asked Olin Stephens to design a beautiful, fast and safe sailing yacht to continue the development of Swan range. Stephens combined the requested characteristics in a fiberglass hull together with a luxurious interior and technical features that were then current in successful racing boats. Its main dimensions are length overall LOA 19,9 m, Length of waterline LWL 14,33 m Beam 4,98 m. Up until the hull #019, the displacement was 31800 kg of which 10400 kg was ballast. From the hull #020 onwards the ballast was increased to 13900 kg resulting to a displacement of 35300 kg. Therefore, for the first 19 hulls the ballast to weight ratio was 31% which was then increased to 39% for the rest of the production. Although it replaced Swan 55 as the flagship of Nautor, the yacht has no actual predecessor in the Nautors own range and according to the designers comments the design is based on a successful American aluminium yacht Dora IV. After the breakthrough in 1968 Cowes Week, Swans continued to score famous victories in the early seventies by winning several famous races including the Bermuda Race in 1972 and 1992 by Swan 48 and most notably in 1973–1974, when a brand new ketch rigged Swan 65 by the name Sayula II won the first ever Whitbread Round the World Race (currently known as The Ocean Race) skippered by Ramon Carlin. It took 133 days and 13 hours for Sayula II to sail the full race distance of 32,500 nautical miles. In 2016, this adventure was presented in a documentary film called The Weeked Sailor. The success of Swan 65 in the Whitbread Round the World Race didn't end there as in the next Whitbread Round the World Race in 1977–1978 Swan 65s scored 2nd, 4th (Disque d’Or), and 5th positions. This time the best result was presented by a sloop called King's Legend (Time 121 days and 11 hours) skippered by Nick Ratcliffe and Skip Novak as the navigator, which finished in second place getting narrowly defeated by Conny van Rietschotens Flyer which was a 65 ft S & S designed purpose built racing yacht manufactured by Royal Huisman. In the same year Clare Francis the first female skipper to compete in the race, finished fifth in her Swan 65 ADC Accutrac (Time 126 days 20 hours).Whitbread History, Krister.tv In 1981–1982 edition of the race Swan 65 made one final appearance at the top end of the round the world race scoreboard with Xargo III finishing sixth and this time beating also a boat called Alaska Eagle (Originally called Flyer). Therefore, the total score of Swan 65 in three different editions of Whitbread Around the World Race are positions 1st,2nd,4th,5th and 6th. Later on Swan 65 also won a number of less famous trans ocean races such as the Parmelia Race in 1979 when Independent Endeavour Skippered by Skip Novak took the line honours and the overall win. This racing success combined with the earlier achievements of Swan 36 significantly increased the Swan brand awareness around the world and secured its place as a successful Finnish industrial product. The legacy of Swan 65 was continued in 1982 by its German Frers designed successor Swan 651 which finished third (Fazer Finland) in 1985–86 Whitbread Round the World Race.

(Clare Francis 1978)  Construction and main equipment  Molded polyester fiberglass hull with no core. Hull is hand laid woven rowing, mat and fiberglass cloth. Deck and deckhouse are foam cored sandwich structure between layers of glass and polyester resin. Additional reinforcement is provided through the use of fiberglass stiffeners. All construction was made according to Lloyd's Register.http://www.classicswan.org/upload/documenti_swan/36-65_t03.gif Because the boat was in production for such a long time the type of engine had to be changed three times. The first hulls were equipped with a Volvo MD32 engine which was soon changed to Perkins H6.354M. This type was used until the production of the engine was discontinued and the engine was changed back to Volvo but this time type was TMD41A. Much of the deck gear, blocks and fittings were manufactured in-house by Nautor simply because most of the parts available in the market were designed for much smaller boats and there were very little deck gear and other equipment available for a boat of this size.  Accommodation  Swan65.com sleeps 12 in four cabin spaces - two in forecastle in pipe cots, four in two forward cabins in pilot berths, three in main cabin in pilot berths and convertible settee, and three in a single and a double berth in the aft cabin.http://www.classicswan.org/upload/articles_swan/2016_10_18_22_53_54-2004_yachtingworld_swan_65.pdf The saloon is roomy and not as dark as the narrow coach roof windows might suggest. Below the decks the sixty five offers very good combination of ocean going practicality and comfort as the berths are relatively small and secure, but the galley and chart table areas as well as the dining area are large, well equipped and very practical. A cut out in the bulkhead allows passing items and communication between the galley and the U- Shaped dining area. On some sixty fives this bulkhead is solid while on others it's completely open with just a pillar running from the lower part of the bulkhead to the deck head. Forward of the saloon are two matching guest cabins with upper and lower single berths parallel to the centerline. Two forward heads with WC lavatory and shower. The owners stateroom in the aft is very spacious, having a double and a single berth, dressing table, cupboards and wardrobes and with WC lavatory and shower.

Taken 4 Jan 2014. Logging within the Toolangi State Forest is sanctioned by the Victorian government and is managed by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Victoria) and VicForests. There is strong local opposition to this logging due to the destruction of small remaining areas of intact forests that provide habitat for the threatened Leadbeater's possum.Forests agency sued for logging, The Age, 19 March 2012 Knitting nannas in court over purler of a protest against logging at Mount St Leonard, The Age, 1 December 2013Federal Govt suggests Victoria's animal emblem is critically endangered, The World Today, 27 May 2013Loggers, activists clash over forest, The Age, 17 August 2011 The Little Red Toolangi Treehouse in the Toolangi State Forest, Victoria, Australia On 8 June 2011 Councillors of the Yarra Ranges Shire voted to write to politicians and call for an immediate halt to logging and future logging on the Bicentennial Trail and Mt St Leonard.Council calls for stop to native logging in Yarra Ranges Lilydale & Yarra Valley Leader, 28 June 2010 =Save Sylvia Creek Supreme Court Case= Following a community led blockade on Sylvia Creek Road, Toolangi State Forest in July to August 2011,Silvia Creek forest, Greenlivingpedia MyEnvironment Inc, a local environment group, obtained an injunction in the Supreme Court, preventing logging in the subject coupes pending resolution of the allegation of unlawful logging. The legal case proceeded on the basis that the logging of the three coupes: *would destroy high-conservation value forest, including Leadbeater’s possum habitat, as defined in the relevant Action Statement, *would be conducted by the clear- fell silviculture system, as indicated in the TRP, 25 September 2009, updated 24 August 2010 and again 15 June 2011 *would be followed by a regeneration burn, as is established (effectively invariable) practice following clear- felling. In late January 2012 MyEnvironment Inc. received an open offer to limit the area logged in the three subject coupes if the action was discontinued. The action proceeded.Save Sylvia Supreme Court Case, MyEnvironment Inc Result of court case Justice Osborn accepted VicForests interpretation that the primary instrument they are required to follow in logging is the Prescription in the Central Highlands Forest Management Plan that includes Leadbeater’s Possum Zone 1A Habitat (living mature and senescing trees) in the Special Protection Zone. He did not agree with VicForests that the trees must be both mature and senescing but preferred the interpretation that both living mature and living senescing trees would be counted. He defined mature as more than 120 years old. He also found the Action Statement under the FFG Act does not independently impose obligations on VicForests. On this basis, Justice Osborn found that: *Logging conducted in the Gun Barrel logging coupe prior to the injunction had not been unlawful, in that no Zone 1A (as now defined) had been logged. *There is no Zone 1A (as now defined) in Gun Barrel and that the logging now proposed will not be unlawful. *Planning for Freddo and South Col coupes has not progressed to a point where it can be said that what is intended to be done would be unlawful; we don’t yet know what is intended. *VicForests is required to comply with the precautionary principle when conducting operations in the Toolangi coupes. Justice Osborne made some further comments in the judgment: *He described VicForests’ case in regard to the economic and social impacts of the grant of an injunction with respect to the consequences of restraining logging at Gun Barrel as \\"less than compelling.\\" (para. 337) *He accepted that there is a strong case for the overall strategic review of the current reserve/exclusion zone system as a result of the 2009 fires. (para. 299) VicForests made a commitment to exclude all Zone 1A in the three coupes from logging, to log Gun Barrel by the VRH system and not to conduct a regeneration burn. These two concessions greatly reduced the environmental damage done by the logging. Costs were awarded against My Environment, but not on the higher scale (indemnity). = Calls for Great Forest National Park = In August 2013 Professor David Lindenmayer called for a new \\"Great Forest National Park\\" in the mountain forests east of Melbourne from Kinglake through to the Baw Baws, and north-east up to Eildon to protect them from logging.New national park proposal to save the Leadbeater's possum, PM, 13 August 2013Park Plan, David Lindenmayer, Great Forest National Park :\\"The last 30 years of work has shown that logging significantly degrades habitats for Leadbeater's possum and makes areas of forest unsuitable for 150 to 200 years. Logging has reduced the amount of old growth forest to less than 1 per cent of the forest cover.\\" :\\"Now that's far worse than anything you would see in Tasmania, and so really what we've seen is a system that's at a state of collapse, possum populations in a state of collapse, and the industry itself is in a state of collapse.\\" = The Little Red Toolangi Treehouse = A tree sit protest in The Little Red Toolangi Treehouse commenced in the Toolangi State Forest during November 2013. Hannah Patchett, moved into The Little Red Toolangi Treehouse of 20 November, motivated by the recommendation of Prof. David Lindenmayer, who called for an end to logging in the area by the end of December 2013 to provide Leadbeater's possum with a chance at avoiding extinction.Leadbeater's possum faces 'managed extinction' without action, Sydney Morning Herald, 27 March 2012 Hannah pledged to remain in the 14-square-metre home until the Victorian state government announces plans for protecting the endangered possum. Hannah moved out for personal reasons and was replaced by Beee Mallia, another young conservationist. Beee has endured all climatic variations since 1 December 2013 and is sacrificing creature comforts in an act of Non-Violent Direct Action to bring attention to the need to protect this unique and globally significant forest. The Toolangi treehouse is also currently functioning as a point of engagement for the broader public.Protester occupies forest treehouse to protect Leadbeater's possum, The Age, 11 November 2013 Gallery File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 01.JPGLittle Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 02.JPGLittle Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 03.JPGLittle Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest, Eviction notice File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 04.JPGLittle Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 05.JPGYea River near Little Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest File:2014-01-04- Toolangi State Forest 600 2743 06.JPGYea River near Little Red Toolangi Treehouse protest in Toolangi State Forest Image:Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) trunk from previous logging.JPGSign of early logging of mountain ash, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia Image:Mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) reaches for the sky.JPGReaching for the sky, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia Image:Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) reach for the sky on Kalatha Walk.JPGReaching for the sky, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia Image:Kalatha tree (Eucalyptus regnans) at the base.JPGKalatha tree base, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia Image:Kalatha tree (Eucalyptus regnans) looking skywards.JPGKalatha tree canopy, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia Image:Fungus and moss on a Eucalyptus Regnans trunk.JPGFungus and moss on mountain ash trunk, Kalatha giant tree walk, Sylvia Creek Rd, Toolangi, Victorian Central Highlands, Australia References Category:Forests of Victoria (Australia) Category:Victoria (Australia) state forests ","title":"Toolangi State Forest"},{"id":"41603076","text":"The Portuguese Joint Command and Staff College () or IESM is the military university establishment that provides training and education to experienced officers of the three service branches of the Portuguese Armed Forces and of the Portuguese National Republican Guard (GNR).

Classified as a saturated higher alicyclic primary alcohol. Both cis and trans isomers exist, depending on the relative positions of the methyl (CH3) and hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) groups on the cyclohexane ring. Commercial samples of MCHM consists of a mixture of these isomers as well as other components that vary with the supplier. The cis and trans isomers of MCHM. It is a colourless oil with a faint mint-like alcohol odor. The trans isomer has a particularly low odor threshold (~7 ppb in water) and a more licorice-like quality which is not associated with the less detectable cis isomer.A similar distinction has been reported in the closely related compound p-menthan-7-ol, where the cis isomer has a \\"fresh\\" lily-of-the-valley scent while the trans isomer has a \\"powerful cumin-like\\" odor. Like other 8-carbon alcohols, such as 1-octanol, this compound is only slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in many organic solvents. The solubility of 1-octanol in water is 2.3 grams per liter. Synthesis and production It was first prepared in 1908 by Bouveault–Blanc reduction of a methylcyclohexanecarboxylate ester. It is also produced as a byproduct (ca. 1%) in the production of cyclohexanedimethanol, a commodity chemical, during hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate. :C6H4(CO2CH3)2 \\\\+ 8 H2 → CH3C6H10CH2OH + 2 CH3OH + H2O Uses It has been patented for use in air fresheners. U.S. Patent 4915825 describes a froth flotation process for cleaning coal where a mixture of 95% MCHM, 4% water, and 0.1% 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol monoether (such as 4-(methoxymethyl)cyclohexanemethanol) is used as a frothing agent, and finely divided coal particles adhere to air bubbles induced into the agent which rise to the surface. Other cyclohexane-based alcohols can also be used. MCHM has the advantage of being less toxic than previous frothing agents containing 2-ethylhexanol. The original patent owners let the patent expire after eight years for failure to pay maintenance fees.Google Patents, US 4915825, Legal Events  Health and safety  Reliable information on health and safety of this compound is limited. The ChemSpider entry for MCHM indicates that it has been evaluated for ligand activity via SimBioSys's LASSO analysis, which predicted low to no activity on 40 biologically significant receptors, indicating a low likelihood for significant biological activity on them.4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol. ChemSpider. Eastman Chemical Company's MSDS for \\"crude\\" (unpurified) MCHM, as supplied by NPR, reports an oral LD-50 of 825 mg/kg and a dermal LD-50 greater than 2,000 mg/kg, both in rats. Further data from Eastman's internal studies was released after the Elk River, West Virginia (2014) spill, including the studies upon which the LD-50 estimate was based and one 28-day study of oral toxicity of pure MCHM which concluded that 400 mg/kg doses were associated with erythropoietic, liver, and kidney effects, though these were not considered more than \\"minor toxicity\\" and the \\"no observed effect\\" level was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day.Eastman Crude MCHM Studies = General chemical class and closely related compounds = A World Health Organization study of the toxicity of alicyclic primary alcohols and related alicyclic carbohydrates (of which MCHM is one type) found that LD-50 values for substances in this class generally \\"ranged from 890 to 5700 mg/kg bw for rats and > 1000 to 4000 mg/kg bw for mice, demonstrating that the oral acute toxicity of alicyclic primary alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters is low\\". The same study indicated that these alcohols are metabolized primarily to corresponding carboxylic acids, which in the case of MCHM is 4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid (CAS 13064-83-0), a naphthenic acid. The toxicity and environmental properties of these naphthenic acids have been well studied recently due to their occurrence as a major contaminant in water used for extraction of oil from tar sands. Naphthenic acids have both acute and chronic toxicity to fish and other organisms. The methyl ester of this acid is also listed as one of the major impurities in the \\"crude MCHM\\" as supplied by Eastman. = Cyclohexanedimethanol = The closely related compound cyclohexanedimethanol (CAS 105-08-8) exhibits low toxicity (3.5 g/kg) when fed orally to rats. = Cyclohexanemethanol = Cyclohexanemethanol (or cyclohexylmethanol, CHM, CAS 100-49-2), another closely related compound, which differs only in lacking a methyl substituent, has been found as a naturally occurring fusel alcohol in mango wine at concentrations of 1.45 mg/l, in which it is considered an aroma constituent. LASSO analysis predicts low to no activity on 40 receptors, similarly to MCHM.Cyclohexylmethanol = p-menthan-7-ol = CHM with a methylethyl (or isopropyl) substituent group at the same position as the methyl group in 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (cis-4-(1-methylethyl) cyclohexane methanol, CAS 13828-37-0) is regarded as a flavoring and fragrance agent, sometimes listed under the synonym p-menthan-7-ol, and was the subject of a review article on its toxicological and dermatological properties in 2008. Among other findings, Bhatia et al. reported a 14-day oral toxicity study in rats with doses of 10.0 g/kg by gavage with no deaths or toxic effects observed, nor any abnormalities on necropsy. Dermal application of \\"neat\\" (pure, undiluted) cis-p-menthan-7-ol at 2 g/kg bodyweight produced toxic effects in rats and rabbits. Various patch tests of cis-p-menthan-7-ol on human volunteers with concentrations of 10%, 15%, and 20% produced irritation in one instance, and a \\"questionable\\" reaction in another. These both occurred out of a group of 102 volunteers with a 15% concentration in diethyl phthalate and ethanol. However, a longer-term (six-week) repetition of that test as a sensitization study failed to produce any reactions. A WHO study concluded that p-menthan-7-ol was of \\"no safety concern\\" for human consumption at high levels of 2.5 μg/kg of bodyweight and for typical levels in Japan of 0.03 μg/day. = 2,4-dimethylcyclohexanemethanol = Another CHM derivative, 2,4-dimethylcyclohexanemethanol (CAS 68480-15-9, also dihydrofloralol or floral methanol), which has two methyl substituents instead of one, is frequently marketed as a fragrance or flavor additive. One web site, Fantastic Flavours provides a list of recognized flavor additives for Japan, which includes 2,4-dimethylcyclohexanemethanol by virtue of being in the group of aliphatic higher alcohols. =Incidents= On 9 January 2014, approximately of impure MCHM leaked from a storage tank near the banks of the Elk River near Charleston, West Virginia (U.S.), from where an undetermined amount entered the river and was taken into the local water system (1,272 gallons were reported recovered). State and federal agencies declared a state of emergency and ordered over 300,000 residents in nine counties—one sixth of West Virginia's population—not to drink or use tap water for any purpose other than flushing toilets. The external affairs manager of West Virginia American Water said that the spill originated with Freedom Industries, a Charleston company.

He was born in Balassagyarmat, in what is now Hungary. Life His parents were Adolf Munk and Rezi Strassburger. In 1913, Magos graduated as an architect. Some of his most notable works include the town beach and flag of the Ipoly-Region. He is credited with designing the first church of Salesian Order in Hungary, the construction of the city hall, the expansion of the hospital, the construction of the Women's Psychiatric Ward, the Casino, the Police Department, the Gendarmerie, the Palace of Finance, the Roman Catholic parsonage, the slaughterhouse and a pedestrian bridge on the river Ipoly. In 1930, he became a member of the Chamber of Engineers. Magos built several military structures for the Hungarian Defence Force between the two World Wars to the satisfaction of the Supreme Command. That included the barracks in Rétság and Pétervására and the fortresses of the \\"Árpád Line\\" in the Carpathian mountains near Kőrösmező (today: Jasyna, Ukraine). Because of his social sensitivity and generous financial support, he was recognized throughout the city. This generosity was demonstrated by young intellectuals who were employed in his companies; one of whom was Zoltán Réti, a prominent painter and conductor. In the 1920s he was baptized. Pál Baross, Magos' godfather and the central head of Nógrád County, appointed József Baross to be deputy head. József became central head in 1919 and later mayor of Budapest. From the early 1940s, he gained prominence with his anti-Nazi publications. For this reason, he was arrested on October 16, 1944, by the Arrow Cross and later executed in Dachau concentration camp. József Baross took on the \\"protection\\" of Dezső Magos, one of his favorite card partners. Magos wore a yellow star so he could walk free and was exempted from confinement in the ghetto. Despite Magos' baptism, he was deported, gained protection and lived free. He died on June 10, 1944, in Aszód as he was deported with the Jewish community. He committed suicide when the group reached Aszód.

Rajam Iyer (15 July 1922 – 3 May 2009) was a Carnatic singer from South India. He was awarded the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1987. Family Rajam Iyer was born in Karaikudi,Dikshitar was his mainstay in Ramnad districtNow Karaikudi is in Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu. His father is Balasubramania Iyer and his mother is Lakshmi Ammal.Indian Heritage - Profile of Artistes Training in music He began his training in Carnatic music under ThirukokarnamKokarneswarar Temple, Thirukokarnam Subbiah Bhagaathar and then under Ganapathy Iyer of Kunnakudi. The latter is a Gottuvadyam and Jalatarangam player. This initial training lasted for about five years. He went for advanced training as the disciple of Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar. This training was undertaken in the traditional Gurukula (residing in the master's residence and serving him) style and lasted for about 10 years. Rajam Iyer grew up as the leading disciple of Ramanuja Iyengar and became an exponent of his style of singing. His long association with Ramanuja Iyengar helped him to enrich his repertoire. In addition, he learnt Muthuswami Dikshitar krithis from T. L. Venkatarama Iyer, a recipient of the Prestigious Sangeetha Kalanidhi award. As a musicologist He set tunes and rhythm to all the 30 Tiruppaavai songs of Sri Andal. He also set tunes to many Rama Natakam songs of Arunachala Kavi. He published these and many other songs to which he set music. He was a tutor to the Travancore royal family members for 4 years since 1943. He served as a member of the selection panels of Madras and Delhi universities. He was a member of the expert committee of the Madras Music Academy Perhaps his greatest achievement was bringing out the Tamil edition of Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshini written by Subbarama Dikshitar. This was done for the Madras Music Academy. Concerts His first concert was during the Thyagaraja Aradhana at Thiruvaiyaru in 1942. He gave his first performance in Chennai (it was called Madras, then) in 1956 with a concert in the Jagannadha Sabha in Egmore. He renders the compositions with sincerity and devotion. His concerts are noted for the sustained interest they acquire from the tana varna to the lighter pieces bringing out the excellence in composition and musical content. He had also served as the \\"Top Grade Artiste\\" of All India Radio.Rajam Iyer dead Publishing of notations of Sri Muthuswami Dikshitar in Swadesamitran Sangita Kalanidhi Sri B. Rajam Iyer was a living authority in rendering Shri Muthuswami Dikshitar’s kritis. He had the benefit of learning these kritis under the tutelage of Shri T.L.Venkatarama Iyer, who himself had the privilege of learning them from Shri Ambi Dikshitar. Shri Rajam Iyer wrote swara notations to several Dikshitar’s compositions and these were published in Swadesamitran, Tamil weekly in 1956. He was fired by a grand ambition — to share and propagate the glories of the Dikshitar heritage. The swara knowledge fostered by his first Guru Sri Kunnakudi Ganapathi Iyer, a Gottuvadyam and a Jalatharangam artiste was a blessing as Dikshitar’s compositions demanded meticulous expertise in the notation process, as evident in Rajam Iyer’s “Selected Compositions of Sri Muttusvami Dikshitar” (2004) published in Roman and Devanagari scripts, or in his contributions as co- editor of Subbarama Dikshitar’s “Sampradaya Pradarsini.”The original Pataantaram (repertoire) of the great composers’ kritis were reflected in the notations. He once visited Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Saylorsburg, Pennysylvana, in August 2003, to conduct a weeklong camp on Dikshitar Kritis in the presence of Pujya Swamiji Dayananda Saraswathi. One of his students Subbalakshmi Chandrasekaran was fortunate to learn a few kritis taught by Shri B. Rajam Iyer and was inspired by the method by which very difficult kritis were taught with ease. She undertook the project of translating the original notations of the kritis in English, for the benefit of the music students all over the world who may not be able to read Tamil. The notations were in English and the sahitya were written following the international scheme of Transliteration. The kritis were written in Devanagiri as well as in Romanised English fonts. The book was published in the year October 2004. Awards and honours *Kalaimamani, 1981 by Tamil Nadu State Government *Swar Vilas, 1981 by Sur singer Samsad, Mumbai *Certificate of Merit and T.T.K.

Prior to his baseball career, he was a short track speed skater who represented the United States at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The son of Cuban immigrants, Alvarez grew up in Miami, Florida. He took up roller skating at age five, began ice speed skating at age seven, and at eleven he won national age-level titles in inline, long track, and short track speed skating. In high school, Alvarez took a break from skating to concentrate on his other love – baseball. He played well enough to earn a college scholarship, but instead quit the sport to pursue his Olympic dream. Alvarez made the 2008 and 2009 World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships, winning a gold medal in 2009. After missing the 2010 Olympics, he returned to baseball in an attempt to give his knees a break after years of chronic pain. He became an All-Conference shortstop, but his knees did not improve. In early 2012, Alvarez underwent surgery to repair badly torn patellar tendons that left him completely immobile for four weeks. He returned to the National Team in July, but was too weak to navigate stairs, let alone skate competitively. After intense physical therapy, Alvarez made the United States' World Cup Team in December 2012. He finished the season as the country's third highest ranked skater. During the 2013–14 World Cup season, Alvarez won three medals. At the 2014 Olympic Trials, he placed second in the 500 meters, second in the 1500 meters, and third in the 1000 meters. The performance made him the first Cuban-American male speed skater to make a U.S. Olympic team. At the Olympics, he won a silver medal in the 5000 meter relay after failing to medal in his three individual events. Prior to the Olympics, Alvarez said he planned to give up speed skating after the Games to concentrate on baseball. After his MLB debut on August 5, 2020, Alvarez became the first Winter Olympics athlete and the first non-baseball Olympian since Jim Thorpe to play Major League Baseball. Early life The son of Cuban immigrants, Eduardo Alvarez was born January 30, 1990 to mother Mabel and father Walter. He grew up in Miami, graduating from Christopher Columbus High School. At age five, Alvarez was given a pair of plastic roller skates. He quickly found he had a talent and passion for the sport, performing tricks such as jumping over boxes for weekend crowds in South Beach. At age seven, his coach, Bob Manning, introduced him to the ice. Taking inspiration from fellow Manning student and Miami resident Jennifer Rodriguez, Alvarez commit himself to one day making the Olympics. At age eleven, \\"Eddy the Jet\\" as he was becoming known as, won the triple crown – national age level titles in inline speed skating, long track speed skating, and short track speed skating. During high school, Alvarez put his skating career on hold to focus on his other love – baseball. He played well enough to earn a full athletic scholarship to St. Thomas University as a shortstop. However, the idea of competing in the Olympics drew him back to speed skating and Alvarez declined the scholarship. \\"Basically my senior year I went up to the head coach and I was like, ‘listen I’ve always had this goal, or a dream, and I want to go back to skating.’\\" he recalled. \\"So I dropped baseball and went back to skating.\\" Skating career Alvarez made the 2008 and 2009 World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships, winning a gold medal in the 3000 meter relay at the 2009 edition. Hampered by a stomach virus, Alvarez placed seventh at the 2010 Olympic Trials and missed the team. After the Trials, he decided to take a break from skating to give his knees a break after years of chronic pain. \\"It got to a point where I couldn’t finish workouts. I would come home and cry\\", he recalled. \\"But I would tell myself to push through it because it was the Olympic season and I had nothing to lose.\\" For the 2011 season, Alvarez walked on to the Salt Lake Community College baseball team. He became the starting shortstop, batted .303, and was named to the All-Conference team for the season. However, his knees did not improve and he finally decided to have them checked out. His doctor found that Alvarez had multiple tears, twelve total, in the patellar tendons of both knees. Alvarez underwent five plasma injections before resorting to a surgery that could have ended any chance of a skating comeback. He had surgery in March 2012 and was completely immobile the next four weeks. \\"That was a tough time,\\" he recalled. \\"My all-time low. I was ready to quit.\\" His father persuaded Alvarez to persevere and by July Alvarez was ready to return to the National Team. He returned as the team was falling apart in the aftermath of accusations that head coach Jae Su Chun had mentally and physically abused athletes. Chun was forced out and formed his own skating club, taking half the National Team with him. Alvarez stayed with the official team. \\"I went back into the national racing program because the only way I could do it was with support\\", he explained. \\"I couldn’t do it on my own. I had to do what was best for me.\\" Alvarez's muscles were so weak from disuse that he could not even navigate a set of stairs without help. While his teammates worked on their skating skills, he underwent intense physical therapy to rehabilitate his leg muscles. By December 2012, Alvarez had recovered enough to qualify for the World Cup team. After the 2013 US National Championships in January, he was ranked fourth overall on the US team. He made the World Championships, and moved up to third by the end of the season. During the 2013–14 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup, he won a gold (at Kolomna) and a silver (at Seoul) in the 5000 meter relay. He also won a bronze (at Shanghai) in the 500 meters. Alvarez opened the 2014 Winter Olympic Trials by placing second in the 1500 meters. He followed it up with a second-place finish in the 500 meters, securing a spot on the Olympic team. He became first Cuban-American male speed skater to make a U.S. Olympic team. \\"It's an incredible feeling,\\" he remarked. \\"This was a dream, a goal of mine since I was a kid. I want to stand on that podium. I want to represent my country and my background, my family, my parents\\". Alvarez concluded the Trials by placing third in the 1000 meters. Alvarez opened the Olympics with a disqualification in the 1500 meters after running into an Italian skater. In the 1000 meters, he was fell when a Canadian skater slipped in front of him. He was taken down by a South Korean in the qualification round of the 5,000 meter relay, but the United States was advanced when a judge ruled the South Korean had impeded Alvarez. In a 500-meter heat, Alvarez again fell, this time on his own when he slipped on some soft ice. Commenting on all the falls, he joked that he should get a medal for his skill at hitting the protective padding at the edge of the rink. Alvarez finished strong, as he and his teammates won the silver medal in the 5,000 meter relay final, finishing 0.271 seconds behind Russia. Prior to the Olympics, Alvarez said he would return to baseball after the Games in the hopes of being drafted. He said he is 95% sure he will not return to the ice again. Baseball career=Chicago White Sox= The Chicago White Sox signed Alvarez to a minor league contract on June 11, 2014. He made his professional debut with the Arizona White Sox of the Rookie-level Arizona League, where he played 27 games. He was promoted to the Kannapolis Intimidators of the Class A South Atlantic League on August 12, 2014. Alvarez began the 2015 season with Kannapolis. After a successful stint with Kannapolis, Alvarez was promoted to the Winston-Salem Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League on July 22, 2015. In 2016, he began the season with the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League, and was promoted to the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League. =Miami Marlins= On March 27, 2019, Alvarez was traded to the Miami Marlins.

Alvarez views fellow short track speed skater J.R. Celski as being like another brother. He says training with Celski, whom he has known since age six, has been the biggest factor in his success as a speed skater. \\"In California we’d be going up the sand dunes and he’d see me coming closer and he would just hit the jets,\\" he recalls. \\"We’re competitive. Everything we do is a competition.\\" After his surgery, Alvarez learned to play guitar to keep himself occupied.

During the Second French Empire he was Minister of Education and Religious Affairs from 1856 to 1863. In this role he undertook reforms to curb the influence of the church. He was later President of the Conseil d'Etat and then governor of the Banque de France from 1864 to 1878, with one short interruption. Early years Gustave Rouland was born in Yvetot, Seine- Inférieure, France, on 3 December 1806. He was the grandson of a farmer and son of an attorney. He attended Rouen College, where he was an exceptional student, and then studied law at the Faculty of Paris. He was admitted to the bar in 1827, and entered the judiciary as a magistrate in the court of Les Andelys. In 1828 in Dieppe he married Julie Félicité Cappon (born 1804), daughter of a clerk of Dieppe. Rouland had a brilliant judicial career under the July Monarchy. He became in turn deputy prosecutor in Louviers (1828) and Évreux (1 June 1831) and prosecutor in Dieppe (1 October 1831). In 1832 he was noted by the deputy Hély d'Oissel as one of the most remarkable young men at the royal court of Rouen, with wide knowledge of the law, easy and brilliant elocution and excellent judgement. In 1835, in an article in the Revue de Rouen, Rouland criticized the complacency and irrelevance of academies such as that of Rouen that ignored the new advances in science, industry and literature. In Rouen he was appointed deputy prosecutor, deputy crown prosecutor-general (17 January 1835) and advocate-general (1 November 1838). He became attorney general in Douai (April 28, 1843). Early political career Rouland was elected on 1 August 1846 as deputy for Dieppe in the Seine-Inférieure department. He sat with the majority, spoke on legislative issues, and on 23 May 1847 was appointed Advocate General at the Court of cassation. He had to run for reelection before he could take this office, and was returned without difficulty. Rouland resigned his position as magistrate in the February Revolution of 1848. He was reinstated on 10 July 1849 and was appointed Attorney General at the Court of Appeals of Paris on 10 February 1853. Minister of Education and Cults On the death of Hippolyte Fortoul, the emperor made Rouland Minister of Education and Religious Affairs. The emperor had at first wanted to appoint Paul Séverin Abbatucci as minister. He was a Corsican, hostile both to priests and to supporters of the former monarchy. However, Abbatucci declined due to his age and instead suggested Rouland. =Religion= Rouland was a sincere Catholic, but was Gallican in his leanings. He made it his goal to strengthen the role of the state in religious affairs. His choice as minister indicated that the emperor was opposed to the growing power of the clergy and to ultramontanism. Rouland was Minister from 13 August 1856 to 24 June 1863. He was made a senator on 14 November 1857. At first Rouland followed a moderate policy to avoid upsetting the Empress Eugénie and Walewski. However, from 1860 the struggle for Italian unification caused the clergy to become increasingly open in their opposition to imperial policy, and Rouland took more positive steps. Rouland was particularly hostile to female religious orders. On 1 December 1861 he published a memorandum in which he criticized the willingness of these congregations to admit minors without obtaining the permission of their parents or guardians, and said that in future this would result in formal legal prosecution. He initiated an inquiry into female religious houses following a number of reported cases of young girls being hidden from their parents under false names, becoming insane through religious ecstasies and being sexually abused. Rouland tried to restrict the growth of religious orders. He blocked donations and bequests to schools if they specified that the school must remain religious. He reduced the number of permits for new women's establishments, and refused to accept any unauthorized new male orders, such as the Jesuits or Capuchins. After 1860 few new female congregations were allowed and no male ones. He also tried to appoint more Gallican bishops, and increasingly came into conflict with the Pope, who refused to institute them. He continued negotiations over recognition by the Pope of state-run theological faculties, but no agreement could be reached over the division of rights between the church and the state. Rouland also pushed for open civil law trials of clergy, where before justice had been managed through discreet agreements with bishops. =Education= In the field of education, Rouland continued his struggle against the clergy. He enforced the ban on private institutions taking the title of college. All schools were forced to charge for tuition, regardless of their statutes, thus removing any competitive advantage of religious schools over state-run schools. Rouland regulated municipal schools run by brothers, gave teachers more protection against priests and limited transfers of schools from lay to religious teachers. He also enacted stricter control on private schools, and obtained more funds for public education. Rouland appointed lay women inspectors to investigate the quality of education for girls in schools around the country. One of these, Marie Caillard, recommended requiring each commune to provide a separate girls' primary school, improving the training of both lay and religious teachers and giving them the same pay. Rouland was able to persuade municipal councils to take back some of the secondary schools they had handed over to the church. There was a significant drop in the number of religious schools compared to the new state institutions and a drop, although smaller, in the percentage of children educated in religious schools, particularly boys. Despite this, Rouland was not liberal in his religious views, and opposed Protestant evangelization. He founded a chair in comparative linguistics for Ernest Renan at the College de France on 11 January 1862, but suspended Renan's course the day after the opening lecture on 18 January 1862 for his \\"attacks on Christian beliefs.\\" In 1858 Rouland separated the agrégations of mathematics and of physical and natural sciences, formerly a single subject. However, although Rouland understood the importance of a modern education, he yielded to pressure from the university to reverse some of the reforms of his predecessor, returning to a more conventional curriculum in which study of the classics dominated. In 1862 Rouland completed a review of the requirements for schools that would meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development. He did not have time to implement these new vocational schools in the last year of his term in office. Rouland encouraged the study of local history, philology and archaeology at the Comité des travaux historiques (CTH) and created a scientific section. In the spring of 1859 he issued a circular on undertaking an archaeological inventory of France. In 1862, at the opening the Palair des facultés in Nancy, Rouland said his audience should be inspired by \\"the traditions that live upon this land of Lorraine, and which France, our common patrie, accepts and glorifies.\\" He initiated the annual Congrès des sociétés savantes in 1861, where officials of his ministry could mingle with leaders of the scientific world. After leaving office Rouland was appointed a member of the Superior Council of Public Instruction on 7 November 1863. In 1867 he said that prefects should have the right to select teachers, saying \\"the teacher should be a friend of public order, the friend of the government.\\" Later career=President of the Council of State= Rouland was reassigned after the cabinet shuffle following the 1863 elections. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour on 14 August 1863. He was Minister and President of the Council of State from 18 October 1863 to 27 September 1864. Rouland was vice-president of the senate for part of 1864. =Governor of the Bank of France= On 28 September 1864 Rouland was appointed Governor of the Bank of France in succession to Adolphe Vuitry. He held this post until 12 December 1878, with one short interruption. Rouland did not have a background in finance, so relied on the expertise of other members of the bank's board. He would present the government's views, but would accede to the opinions of the board and then defend them in public. During the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871) and subsequent upheavals Rouland managed to preserve the Bank's funds and the crown jewels, with the help of the deputy governor Fréderic Cuvier. During Rouland's tenure there was serious debate about the value of European monetary union. The main argument in its favor was that it would reduce the transaction costs of tourists and businessmen, who constantly lost money as they exchanged from one currency to another. The English economist William Stanley Jevons argued in favor, while Walter Bagehot, editor of The Economist was opposed. Rouland also argued against monetary union, asserting that most international transactions were through bills of exchange or remittance of bullion, and that costs would be unavoidable in such transactions even with unification. He opposed issuance of a new 25-franc gold coin, which he saw as a covert method of moving towards unification. On 5 June 1871 Rouland was appointed Attorney General to the Court of Auditors. Ernest Picard was appointed in his place as Governor of the Bank of France, but refused to accept the position. Picard's decision seems have been due to strong opposition from the bank. Rouland was reinstated as Governor of the Bank of France on 30 December 1871, holding this position until 12 December 1878. =Other positions= Rouland was General Counsel to the canton of Yvetot, secretary and president of the departmental assembly. On 30 January 1876 Rouland was elected Senator of the Seine-Inférieure. He sat with the Bonapartist right. He died in office on 12 December 1878, at the premises of the Bank of France, from an \\"attack of gout rising to the heart\\" (accès de goutte remontée au cœur). He was buried in Omonville. His son Hippolyte Rouland later became a senator. His grandson Julien Gustave André Rouland (1860–1937) also became a deputy and then a senator.

The film is about a deceased aunt who forgets to take a proper handbag on her journey to Hell. Plot A girl lives with her aunt in a small house. One day, the aunt gets late for a washing machine payment. When reading the contract, she finds that “on non-payment of installments, the contractee shall go to Hell without further notice.” She makes a phone call for a devil who lives in Hell and when he arrives, he kills her by giving her a heart attack and the girl witnesses her getting dropped to Hell and puts her dead body under a grave she had made. Meanwhile, while falling down the yellow spiral that leads to Hell, the aunt feels that she has forgotten something and starts to return to find out what it is, avoiding the devil. When returning as a skeleton, she explains to her niece that she forgot to take her treasured accessory, a proper handbag. That night, the devil returns and transforms into a handbag when eating the handbag. He causes havoc around the house: he attacks and eats a mouse, and knocks the food in the refrigerator, until the girl catches him, but the devil kidnaps her in the washing machine. The next morning, the aunt looks for her handbag and she finds the devil torturing her niece in the washing machine and says that the monster is a very cheap imitation. The devil says he will give her a cheap imitation and starts dragging her to Hell again, but the girl stops him with a bakery’s worth of food. The devil eats the pastries and grows big and fat. The girl feeds him a chocolate éclair and the devil explodes releasing the handbag and land in front of its owner’s feet.

In 1867 the novel came out as a separate edition in Saint Petersburg. Background Leskov started working upon the novel in autumn 1865 right after the Neglected People, and finished in the early 1866. In it he started to investigate what he himself defined as \\"Saint Petersburg types,\\" - this time taking as a sample the life of the two ethnic German families, the Norks and the Schultses, concentrating on the story of painter Istomin (who has the relations with Manichka Nork). The novel features Leskov's numerous commentaries upon the discussion concerning the development of fine arts that was going on in the Russian press in 1865 featuring clashes between the different sections of the Russian fine arts community, dealing mostly with the controversy surrounding the so-called \\"Riot of the 14\\" of the Imperial Academy of Arts when a group of artists, led by Ivan Kramskoi, refused to take part in the Golden medal competition as a protest against the Academy's refusal to credit the rise of the new realism in the Russian painting. The Russian press was strongly advised to ignore the theme and Leskov had to be very careful in defining his position which proved to be ambivalent: while supporting the demands for reforming the Academy (expressed by newspapers Golos and Vedomosti), he was opposing the Sovremennik and Russkoye Slovo leftist authors (whom he tagged 'theoreticians') and promoted the idea of \\"religious and moral mission\\" of fine arts. In his 1881 letter to Alexey Suvorin Leskov regretted what he called one of his \\"old mistakes\\", namely \\"a certain portrait likeness\\" one of his Islanders novel characters had to a certain real person. Whom did he mean exactly, scholars weren't sure: some said the prototype for Istomin (bearing in mind his capriciousness, tetchiness and womanizing) could have been Karl Bryullov, others pointed to Sergey Zaryanko (1818–1870), a once promising young painter who's squandered his potential by too much commercial work. Critical reception Contemporary critics all but ignored The Islanders, being still under the impression of No Way Out novel, almost unanimously condemned as 'reactionary'. Nikolai Mikhaylovsky in his December 1866 review published in Knizhny Vestnik, gave the novel a mere mention, referring to it as \\"another spicy novel by Stebnitsky\\". Conservative critic Nikolai Solovyov in his 1867 essay \\"The Two Novelists\\" published by Vsemirny Trud, dismissed the novel as a failure. \\"In The Islanders... this author falls lower still, leaving even Mr. Pisemsky behind, from whom he learned a lot, to submerge himself into pure romanticism. Being totally ignorant, apparently, of the side of life he touches here, he sets all his teeth into this Istomin character, and so merciless and obvious this execution is that in the end one is tempted to sympathize with poor Istomin, amorphous as his figure is. In the end the author has a good sense to pity his hero, but still for the reader all this is nothing but comedy, or at least some kind of a fantasy, having nothing to do with the real life.\\" References Category:Novels by Nikolai Leskov Category:1866 Russian novels Category:Novels first published in serial form ","title":"The Islanders (Leskov novel)"},{"id":"41603701","text":"The Sir Samuel Hall Chair of Chemistry is the named Chair of Chemistry in the School of Chemistry at the University of Manchester, established through an endowment of £36,000 in 1913 by the Hall family.Portrait of a University, 1851-1951: To Commemorate the Centenary of Manchester University, Henry Buckley Charlton, Manchester University Press, 1951.

It runs from Interstate 295 (I-295) to SR 102 (Airport Road). The road's name comes from the fact that its northern terminus is at the entrance to Jacksonville International Airport. Route description SR 243 serves mainly as a secondary access road for Jacksonville International Airport. The route starts at an interchange with I-295, and runs through mostly wooded areas and light industrial zones. Near its northern terminus, SR 243 has one intersection at a service road that leads to SR 102 (Airport Road) before ending at Jacksonville International Airport. The road runs between two plots of land owned by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority and the privately owned Jacksonville International Tradeport, respectively. South of I-295, the road continues as Duval Road and has a hidden designation of County Road 110 (CR 110). History International Airport Boulevard was constructed at the cost of $7.2 million, and opened on May 7, 2004 at 9:30 a.m. Prosser Hallock was in charge of the project. The route benefits those who are coming from the west part of Jacksonville. Beforehand, drivers coming to the airport from the west had two ways to get to the airport from I-295. The quickest way was to take I-295 to I-95 north, and use the Airport Road exit. Another way was to use the Duval Road exit (which now includes International Airport Boulevard) from I-295 and take a winding path to the airport using two local roads—Duval Road and Pecan Park Road. The new road created a straight shot to the airport from I-295 and shortened the drive from the west by about . However, the main reason International Airport Boulevard was built was in anticipation of future expansions to Jacksonville International, and in turn, more traffic to and from the airport. Future plans included expanding the airport's runways in 10 to 15 years, which in turn would result in the demolition of part of Pecan Park Road to make room for the larger runway. Further plans include extending SR 243 even further north, and creating another access point to I-95 via the rerouted Pecan Park Road.

It is located approximately from Poonthottam in the Cauvery Delta. Etymology Rettakudi derives its name from the legend of Lord Siva and Arjuna in the Mahabaratha: in a fit of anger, Arjuna struck the head of Siva and split it in two (retta meaning \\"two\\" in the Tamil language). The village is named in recognition of this legend. Today, one can see the head of the Sivalinga in broken form. Location and transportation Rettakudi is located about from both Mayiladuthurai and Thiruvarur, and about from Tirunallar. The nearest railway station is in Poonthottam, about distant, while bus transport is available from the nearby village of Ambal, distant. Climate The period from November to February in Rettakudi is marked by warm days and cool nights. The onset of summer is from March, with temperatures peaking by the end of May and June. Summer rains are sparse and the first monsoon, the South-West monsoon, sets in June and continues till September. North-East monsoon sets in October and continues till January. The rainfall during South-West monsoon period is much lower than that of North-East monsoon. The North-East monsoon is beneficial to the district at large because of the heavy rainfall and the Western ghats feeding the river Cauvery. Economy The major occupation of the people in Rettakudi is agriculture. Religion Rettakudi features a temple dedicated to Sastha, the deity worshipped by most of the village inhabitants. There are also temples dedicated to Ganesh, Shiva, Vishnu and Pidari Amman, the gramadevata (village deity) of Rettakudi. A wonderful srei veeranar temple is in the village. This temple is a private kuladevadha temple for particular peoples. Annual festivals are conducted for two days during the month of May. During this festival many who have left Rettakudi for the cities return to celebrate together with their families.

It was unveiled in 1921, and consists of a stone pillar and pedestal and three bronze statues. One statue is that of a mourning female, and the others comprise Britannia laying a wreath over a soldier who had died from gassing, an unusual subject for a war memorial at the time. The memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The War Memorial In 1919 a public meeting was held in the town and a War Memorial Committee was formed. The committee invited public subscriptions to be given toward the design and erection of a memorial to commemorate those who had been lost in the First World War. Although money was slow to come in, the committee invited John Millard of the Manchester School of Art to produce a model for a memorial. The model included a statue of Britannia laying a crown of laurels on the body of a soldier who had died from gassing. There was discussion about the \\"gruesome\\" nature of this statue, and some argued for a more heroic subject, but Millard's model was eventually accepted. It was built locally by E. and H. Frith, and was unveiled by the Mayor of Macclesfield on 21 September 1921. The ceremony was attended by about 20,000 people. Description The memorial consists of a stone pedestal and pillar, with statues, wreathes, and inscribed plates in bronze. It stands about high. Behind the memorial is a curved wall ending in pillars and there are four more pillars arranged in front of the memorial; all these carry inscribed plates. On top of the main pillar is the bronze statue of a female figure, mourning and holding a wreath, representing those who were left behind at home. At the foot of the column are two more bronze statues. One is of a soldier who has died from gassing, clutching a gas mask which he had not had time to place over his face. The other is of Britannia, leaning over the soldier, placing a laurel wreath over his head. On the front of the base of the memorial is an inscription: The left side of the pillar is inscribed: The right side is: And the back is inscribed: The names of those who lost their lives are inscribed on a series of bronze plates. Appraisal Following the First World War most memorials were designed to evoke heroic triumphalism or detached contemplation, and they avoided depicting the horrors of war. It was unusual to include depictions of dead soldiers, as this was thought to be too gruesome, an objection that was raised about the dead soldier in the Royal Artillery Memorial by Charles Sargeant Jagger at Hyde Park Corner in London. To depict soldiers dying heroically was more acceptable, and servicemen dying in the arms of angels were included in memorials by Ferdinand Blundstone in war memorials in Stalybridge and at the Prudential Assurance Building in London. As the Macclesfield Memorial is an exception to the general rule of design for war memorials at the time, Morris and Roberts in the Public Sculpture in Britain series consider it to be \\"of great interest\\". The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building. It was initially designated on 1 March 1977 at Grade II, and this was raised to Grade II* on 11 November 2016. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". Writing about the architecture of Macclesfield, Hartwell et al. in the Buildings of England series describe the memorial as being \\"The finest thing in town\\".
