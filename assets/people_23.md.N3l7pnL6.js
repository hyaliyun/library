Of course, 0 K can never be reached in practice so some estimation is usually made. Since the RRR can vary quite strongly for a single material depending on the amount of impurities and other crystallographic defects, it serves as a rough index of the purity and overall quality of a sample. Since resistivity usually increases as defect prevalence increases, a large RRR is associated with a pure sample. RRR is also important for characterizing certain unusual low temperature states such as the Kondo effect and superconductivity. Note that since it is a unitless ratio there is no difference between a residual resistivity and residual-resistance ratio. Background Usually at \\"warm\\" temperatures the resistivity of a metal varies linearly with temperature. That is, a plot of the resistivity as a function of temperature is a straight line. If this straight line were extrapolated all the way down to absolute zero, a theoretical RRR could be calculated :RRR = {\\\\rho_{300K}\\\\over \\\\rho_{0K}} In the simplest case of a good metal that is free of scattering mechanisms one would expect œÅ(0K) = 0, which would cause RRR to diverge. However, usually this is not the case because defects such as grain boundaries, impurities, etc. act as scattering sources that contribute a temperature independent œÅ0 value. This shifts the intercept of the curve to a higher number, giving a smaller RRR. In practice the resistivity of a given sample is measured down to as cold as possible, which on typical laboratory instruments is in the range of 2 K, though much lower is possible. By this point the linear resistive behavior is usually no longer applicable and by the low temperature œÅ is taken as a good approximation to 0 K. Special Cases * For superconducting materials, RRR is calculated differently because œÅ is always exactly 0 below the critical temperature, Tc, which may be significantly above 0 K. In this case the RRR is calculated using the œÅ from just above the superconducting transition temperature instead of at 0 K. For example, superconducting Niobium‚Äìtitanium wires have a RRR defined as \\\\rho(293 K)/\\\\rho(10 K). *In the Kondo effect the resistivity begins to increase again with cooling at very low temperatures, and the value of RRR is useful for characterizing this state. Examples * The RRR of copper wire is generally ~ 40‚Äì50 when used for telephone lines, etc. References Bibliography *Ashcroft, Neil W.; Mermin, N. David (1976). Solid State Physics.

He is credited with helping develop the anthropology of the Plains Indian tribes while serving as curator at the Field Museum in Chicago from 1898 until 1915. During this period, he also was Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago from 1907 to 1915. In 1897 Dorsey was one of the first anthropologists to appear as an expert forensic witness when examined what he proved were human remains and testified in the murder trial of Adolph Luetgert in Chicago. In 1925, his cultural study, Why We Behave Like Human Beings, became an unexpected bestseller. This inspired the reissue of his 1917 novel, and enabled him to publish several more books on anthropology and culture. One book in preparation at the time of his death in 1931 was published posthumously. Early life and education Dorsey was born in Hebron, Ohio, to Edwin Jackson and Mary Emma (nee Grove) Dorsey. He attended local schools before college. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Denison University in 1888, then a second bachelor's degree in anthropology in 1890 at Harvard University. He was awarded his PhD in 1894, based on his dissertation, An Archaeological Study Based on a Personal Exploration of Over One Hundred Graves at the Necropolis of Ancon, Peru. This was the first PhD in anthropology to be awarded by Harvard, and the second awarded in the United States. Career Based on his work in Peru in 1892, Dorsey became head of the archaeological branch of the department of anthropology at Harvard, serving until 1896. In 1897 he joined the staff of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. as assistant curator. He was promoted to curator in 1898 and served until 1915. From 1907 to 1915 he also was Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago. In the 1890s Dorsey had travelled with Anglo-Canadian botanist and ethnographer Charles Frederick Newcombe and Scottish guide James Deans in Northwest Canada to gather Haida artefacts that might be of ethnographic interest. Their methods varied, but they frequently held little regard for the sensibilities of the First Nations, or native Canadians. The local missionary, John Henry Keen took them to task after learning that they had raided graves and failed to restore them to their former state. Keen found hair and coffins strewn about from where the men had dug to steal skulls and bones. Keen published a letter in the Daily Colonist complaining about the desecration and challenged Deans to name his accomplices. He knew that the benefactor of their work was the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago and that the perpetrators were Americans. George Dorsey was known for his haste to acquire artefacts. When told of Keen's letter to the Daily Colonist, he argued that Keen's anger should be ignored. During the Great War (World War I), Dorsey was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve. In the later part of 1918 he was appointed as assistant naval attache at Madrid, and in 1919-21 naval attache at Lisbon. He was an adviser on Spanish problems to the American Commission to Negotiation Peace at Paris. In addition to his formal studies of early societies for anthropology, Dorsey became involved in studying the waves of emigration from \\"Italy, Austria, Hungary, Rumania, Serbia and Bulgaria, and had studied political conditions in India, China, Japan, Australia and South Africa. He had been a delegate to international congresses of anthropology, and was a member of the Jury of Awards in this field for the St. Louis Exposition in 1904.\\" After his book Why We Behave Like Human Beings (1925) became a bestseller, Dorsey wrote and published several other general interest books on anthropology and culture. His 1917 novel was reissued in 1927. Dorsey had achieved some early media notoriety in 1897 and 1898 when he was called to aid the investigation of the murder of Louisa Luetgert in Chicago. He was one of the first anthropologists called to testify as an expert forensic witness in a murder case; he had identified four tiny fragments of bone as human and helped gain the arrest and conviction of Adolph Luetgert for the sensational murder of his wife in 1897. The murder case received national coverage from newspapers.Elizabeth Royte, ‚ÄúLet the Bones Talk is the Watchword for Scientist-Sleuth,‚Äù Smithsonian Magazine, May 1996, vol. 27, no. 2.Robert Loerzel, Alchemy of Bones: Chicago's Luetgert Murder Case of 1897, University of Illinois Press, 2007; \\"Alchemy of Bones\\" website: Adolph Luetgert, http://www.alchemyofbones.com/who/luetgertfamily/adolph.htm Luetgert was convicted of the murder in his second trial. Marriage and family Dorsey married Ida Chadsey on December 8, 1892, while completing his PhD. They had two children together: Dorothy Ann and George Chadsey Dorsey. They separated in April 1914, and were subsequently divorced. Their daughter married and their son became a manager at Marshall Field & Company in Chicago. Ida Chadsey Dorsey died in 1937. Dorsey married Sue McLellan after his divorce. He died suddenly in 1931 of an embolism at his home in New York City, shortly before he was to give a radio talk and his book On Civilization was published.DR GEORGE DORSEY, AUTHOR, DROPS DEAD\\", New York Times, 30 March 1931; accessed 10 July 2018 Legacy and honors *Awarded Doctor of Laws in 1909 by Denison University Works * * ' (1901) * ' (1903) * ' (1903) * ' (March 1905) * ' (May 1905) * Young Low, a novel (1917) * Why We Behave Like Human Beings (1925) * The Nature of Man (1927) * The Evolution of Charles Darwin (1927) * Race and Civilization (1928) * Hows and Whys of Human Behavior (1929) * On Civilization (1931, posthumously) Many more of his works are available at the Internet Archive.

Stereogum founder Scott Lapatine founded Videogum as a sister site to Stereogum in 2008, and enlisted editors Gabe Delahaye and Lindsay Robertson, who quickly gained a cult following for their humorous commentary on pop culture and the Internet. Videogum spawned an online community known as the \\"Monsters\\" who perpetuated a variety of internet memes through the site's commentary system, chat, their communal blog, and via Twitter. The site garnered several nominations and accolades, including a win at the 2010 ECNY Awards for \\"Best Website\\". History In 2009, Lindsay Robertson left the site, leaving Gabe Delahaye as its sole voice. Videogum was mentioned in several prominent publications including The New York Times, and inspired segments on TV shows including Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2010/02/spiderman- superman-brothers-breakdance/ In 2011, Kelly Conaboy was hired as junior editor. Delahaye frequently made fun of her dislike of the movie You Can Count On Me. In 2012, Mary Miller was hired as a second associate editor. Videogum was named one of the Best Blogs of 2011 by Time. In 2013, Gabe Delahaye quit Videogum.http://pyhtshow.libsyn.com/wil-anderson-gabe-delahaye-ben-lerman- nate-fernald February 7, 2014 was the last day of normal operations for Videogum, at which time editor Scott Lapatine was \\"assessing options for keeping Videogum online in some form\\".http://www.videogum.com/800151/hey-guys- we-have-to-talk-to-you-about-something/letter-from-the-editor/ Former recurring features * Why Don't You Caption It: Feature in which the site's commenters were encouraged to create their own caption for an absurd or funny photo selected by the editor. The comment with the most upvotes got special placement in that week's Monsters' Ball. * Teen Korner: A satirical commentary on teenage trends and interests written in slang. * Monsters' Ball: The Week's Best Comments: This weekly feature compiled the 5 highest-rated comments (rated by the Monsters themselves), the lowest-rated comment, the Why Don't You Caption It winner, and an Editor's Choice comment. * Taking One for the Team: Author and comedian Joe Mande participated in activities or attending events that would generally be mocked on Videogum. This feature saw Joe performing many tasks, such as reading Glenn Beck's The Overton Window and attending a live taping of The Marriage Ref. * Best New Party Game: A semi- regular feature in which Gabe established a contest generally themed around cinematic wordplay or parodies of popular film quotes. The site's commenters voted for their favorites, and the winner was mentioned in the Monsters' Ball. * Videogum Movie Club: On weeks which saw the major theatrical release of a movie relevant to the site's interests, Gabe posted a short review and open discussion of the film was encouraged in the comments section. * Duh Aficionado Magazine: Not an official site feature but a very common recurring theme. The title was usually given to posts which featured news that served to reaffirm the generally held belief about the subject. * Videogum Promise: Videogum promised to diligently follow a select listing of celebrities and post any interesting interviews or news relating to them. The promise was made regarding the following celebrities: Tracy Morgan, Louis C.K., Zach Galifianakis. * Videogum Archives: Included, \\"The TWSS Archives\\" and \\"The Porno Switcheroo Archives.\\" \\"The TWSS Archives\\" highlighted typical That's What She Said moments in which someone made an unintended sexual innuendo, while \\"The Porno Switcheroo Archives\\" highlighted instances where actual pornography was unintentionally shown in public. * Top Chef Recaps: A weekly column where Gabe recaped that week‚Äôs episode of Top Chef. * Mad Men Recaps: A weekly column recapping that week‚Äôs episode of Mad Men. This column was usually written by Benji Meyer, a 10-year-old who lived with his parents in Ohio. However, when Benji wasn't forced to watch Mad Men and was allowed to go to bed early, Gabe wrote the recap. *The Petting Zoo: The Week's Top 10 Animal Videos: A weekly round-up of Kelly's favorite viral pet videos. *Friendly Chat: Wednesday end-of-day chat conversation between Gabe and Kelly. They generally discussed a news point of the day. Kelly was usually fired by the end of the chat. *How Was Everyone's Day Today: Thursday end-of-day feature that utilized the comments section as a forum for Monsters to talk about the latest events in their lives. * You Can Make It Up: A weekly piece of celebrity fan fiction. Unlike most fan fiction, Delahaye's pieces parodied the celebrity, incorporating some current embarrassing action or statement from that celebrity. For example, after former model and talk show host Tyra Banks pretended to have rabies on an episode of her show, Delahaye wrote a piece called \\"Tyra Banks Has Rabies in the Forest,\\" which cast her as a blood- thirsty animal. * The Hunt for the Worst Movie of All Time: Videogum's longest running feature, in which Gabe attempted to watch as many reader-nominated films as he could in an attempt to find the worst. Often referred to simply as \\"The Hunt,\\" the inspiration for this feature came from Gabe's feelings after watching the film Death Sentence starring Kevin Bacon. There were many rules governing what films may be nominated including availability on Netflix, whether or not it is \\"intended\\" to be horrible, and inclusion of \\"A- or B-list\\" actors, among others. * Double Dog: The predecessor to \\"Taking One for the Team,\\" these posts featured either Gabe or Lindsay completing challenges presented to them by the other. Some examples include Gabe attending a taping of Today and Lindsay taking a TV Bus Tour of New York City while alone and wearing a \\"Just Jack\\" T-shirt. * Friday Fights: A feature during Lindsay's tenure in which she and Gabe engaged in a debate formatted as an IM conversation. This feature was briefly revisited with Gabe and RichFourFour debating the merits of Inception for the Videogum Movie Club. * Lost Recaps: Gabe recapped episodes of the popular ABC show Lost until its final episode in May, 2010. * The Event Recaps: Gabe recapped episodes of the ABC show The Event until Gabe realized The Event stinks and was not the new Lost. * True Blood Recaps: A weekly column where Gabe reviews that week‚Äôs episode of True Blood which he lovingly refers to as \\"The Worst Show On Television\\". * What's Up With Topher Grace?: Perhaps Videogums most well-known feature where the site periodically checked in to see what is up with actor Topher Grace and his current career happenings. On September 22, 2010, Gabe stated that he was ending the feature, on the day of its one-year anniversary. Gabe explained his decision with \\"I think we‚Äôre done here. If even I am losing enthusiasm for this, then I believe I have made my point.\\" He concluded the final column with \\"Best of luck to Topher Grace and all of the human beings trying to make it in this world.\\" * Glee Recaps: A weekly column where guest author Gabe Liedman (informally Soft Gabe) recapped the week‚Äôs episode of Glee. * Movies For Dudes: A weekly feature in which Gabe Liedman took on the genre of Dude Flicks, where guns, pecs, car crashes, and glib one-liners delivered in front of a burning building with only half a T-shirt on and nothing left to lose reign supreme. Gabe Liedman loves those movies for so many reasons, all of which are that they turn him ON. Monsters Videogums commenter community was embraced by the administrators. Senior editor, Gabe Delahaye attributed this to his participation as a regular commenter on pop culture sites.https://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/from_commenter_to_contributor.php?page=all Famous \\"monsters\\" or commenters have included: *Ken Jennings *Ted Leo *Jake Fogelnest Videogum was also associated with the \\"Goof Troop\\" Internet group.

The General Secretary of the Islamic Society, Nasim Yaseen, thanked the donors who helped realize the project. He stated that the goal of the as-Sadaka Athletic Club was to contribute to \\"retaining steadfastness in the country against the occupation and tyranny which seeks undermine the resolve of our people.\\" The ribbon was cut jointly by Nasim Yaseen and the Hamas PLC member Jamal al- Khoudouri. As-Sadaka members performed swimming exercises for the dignitaries. Reactions Soon after the inauguration of the pool, its existence was cited by Israeli government spokespersons as demonstrating the complexity of the economic situation in Gaza. A press release was dispatched to journalists from the Israeli Government Press Office, based on a commentary by British journalist Tom Gross. Gross had published a comment on his blog which included references to the As-Sadaka pool, claiming that it showed a part of Gazan reality obscured through the \\"manipulative agenda of the BBC and other foreign media agencies\\".GPO advises foreign journalists on luxurious Gaza restaurant, Yaakov Lappin, 05/27/2010, Jerusalem Post. The Israeli Government Press Office was inspired by Gross' dispatch and sent out an email to journalists advising to enjoy fine dining at the Roots Club and suggesting that they may also wish \\"to enjoy a swim at the new Olympic size swimming pool.\\" The Guardian accused the Press Office of using Gaza's new gourmet restaurant and this new Olympic- sized swimming pool in Gaza \\"to highlight Israel's claim there is no humanitarian crisis there.\\"\\"Israel forced to apologize for YouTube spoof of Gaza flotilla,\\" Rachel Shabi, June 6, 2010, The Guardian. Israelis and supporters of Israel abroad have since used the construction of this swimming pool as a way of promoting the point of view that there is a gap between some media depictions of Gaza and the realities on the ground. Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, for example, recently wrote that \\"No one claims that the situation in Gaza is perfect,\\" but claims the \\"situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis on the scale of Darfur,\\" are made absurd in light of the fact that \\"This is the same Gaza that just opened a sparkling new Gaza Mall shopping mall that would not look out of place in any capital in Europe. Gaza, where a new Olympic-sized swimming pool was recently inaugurated and five-star hotels and restaurants offer luxurious fare,\\" and \\"Markets brimming with all manner of foods dot the landscape of Gaza.\\"Flotilla Farce; Whether they are from Turkey, Ireland or Cyprus, those that participate reek of hypocrisy.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. The church stands near the River Teifi and worshippers were sometimes trapped when the river flooded. They were then ferried home in a coracle that was kept in the church porch for this purpose. The river no longer floods, and the church is no longer used for regular worship, but the tradition of keeping a coracle in the porch continues. When it was stolen, local people raised money for it to be replaced. History The site is thought to have been occupied by a church since the 6th or 7th century, dedicated to Llawddog, a Celtic saint. From the evidence of an inscription on the bell, it is believed that it was later dedicated to Saint Lawrence. When the parish was created in the 12th century, the dedication was changed to Saint David. The nave and chancel of the present church date from the 13th or 14th century, and the porch was added at a \\"slightly later\\" date. It was probably altered in the 18th century, and repaired between 1835 and 1844. It was abandoned as a parish church in 1899. The church was repaired in 1905 and again between 1948 and 1973. It was vested with the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 2000, who hold a 999-year lease with effect from 10 August 2000. Architecture Church interior, showing the coracle kept in the porch The church is constructed in stone and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel, with a large west porch, a north vestry, and a single bellcote at the west end. The interior is plastered and whitewashed. The floor of the nave is paved with slates and there is a three-sided altar platform in the chancel. The church contains box pews, four of them being larger for the use of the more prominent local families; the two easternmost of these are furnished with fireplaces. Elsewhere are open-back benches. The pulpit is plain and is partly built into one of the pews. The font is square on a circular shaft and a square base. The font dates from the 13th century, while the bell is from the 15th century. In the church are a number of monuments, one of which commemorates Charles Colby who was killed by a tiger in India in 1852. Another is to the memory of the Welsh poet John Blackwell who died in 1840 and is buried in the churchyard.

It can be defined as an economically integrated region within which residents can find jobs within a reasonable commuting distance or can change their employment without changing their place of residence. Commuting flows are a primary consideration in defining and delineating labor market areas. The extent to which workers are willing and able to commute between two places indicates the degree of economic integration between those places. United States In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) maintains standard definitions of labor market areas for the purpose of standardization and to promote comparability of the labor force information used by various government programs. Definitions are updated annually, and the entire system of definitions is reevaluated once each decade based on decennial census data. BLS uses metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, including metropolitan divisions, as its principal basis for defining labor market areas. In New England, labor market area definitions are based on New England city and town areas rather than the county-based statistical areas used in other parts of the country. For geographic areas outside of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, the BLS identifies labor market areas based primarily on commuting data, with a requirement that all components of a labor market area be contiguous.

This lithograph by Charles Motte was possibly made in the 1820s. The depiction should not be read literally; some princes were represented by envoys. Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine was the title held by Napoleon, Emperor of the French, in his function as leader of the Confederation of the Rhine (1806-1813). The term in French was Protecteur de la Conf√©d√©ration, in German Protector des rheinischen Bundes. The title was created by the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine, which was an international treaty between the emperor and some German princes. The treaty text mentions the emperor only once explicitly: > Art. 12. His Majesty the Emperor of the French will be called Protector of > the Rhenish Confederation, and in this virtue the same will appoint the > successor of the prince-primate after every departure. The prince-primate was the chair of the Federal Assembly, the unrealised convention of the member states. The treaty remains silent about the function of the federal protector. For example, the treaty does not say that the protector guarantees the territorial integrity of the member states, although the treaty adjusts a number of territorial changes.Michael Kotulla: Deutsches Verfassungsrecht 1806‚Äì1918.

For Napoleon, the Confederation of the Rhine was an instrument to secure the military support of the Rhenish states when necessary. The power balance was one-sided; France alone decided when to mobilize (Art .36). France and the Rhenish states were allowed to negotiate international treaties, including with states outside of the Confederation. The protector usually did not consult with his allies at the important peace settlements of the time. The treaty says that the Rhenish states had to be independent from foreign powers. They were allowed to decline their souvereignity in total or partially only to other Rhenish states (Art. 7, Art. 8). In 1810 and 1811 the member states Westphalia and Berg yielded territory to France. As France was no member of the Confederation, they violated Art. 8.Michael Kotulla: Deutsches Verfassungsrecht 1806‚Äì1918. Eine Dokumentensammlung nebst Einf√ºhrungen.

Hewes is associated with the construction and completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad, although he was an enthusiastic supporter rather than being directly connected with the construction thereof. He provided a golden spike marking completion of the railroad and he also planned the connection of the railroad company's wires to Western Union so the taps of the silver hammer driving the golden spike at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory could be heard instantaneously coast-to- coast.Kraus, George. High Road to Promontory, pp. 262-3, Castle Books, New York, New York, 1969. Hewes as portrayed in the Los Angeles Times, August 23, 1913 Hewes supported himself from the age of fourteen and earned enough to pay for his education including entry into Phillips Academy, Andover and Yale College. During his second year at Yale he joined his savings with a small inheritance from his father investing the monies in galvanized iron houses that were shipped to California. He travelled by ship and arrived at San Francisco in February 1850 and later set up a general merchandise store in Sacramento. In 1852 Sacramento was devastated by fire and in early 1853 a flood leaving Hewes with little resources. Seeing San Francisco as a promising metropolis of the Pacific Coast he began a small-scale business of earth- moving as the city was leveling sand dunes and filling streets. David Hewes and his wife, Matilda French, lived in the Camron-Stanford House in Oakland, California. The house still stands and is now a museum. It has a bust of Hewes and paintings of family members in its collection. Hewes' Steam Paddy Company purchased steam shovels and then built the first steam locomotive on the Pacific Coast. He grew the enterprise to reclaiming the harbor, blocked by hundreds of abandoned ships from the gold rush, to level and fill the area where much of San Francisco's business district now stands. He was called the \\"maker of San Francisco\\" because it was through \\"his initiative and energy that the task was undertaken and accomplished\\". Hewes was invited to be a part of the Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad) but declined due to the financial risks, over his lifetime he gained and lost several fortunes. Hewes first marriage was to Matilda C. Gray in 1875 and they spent two and a half years in Europe. On the return trip Matilda's health necessitated that they move to a warmer climate. In 1881, they settled in Southern California, building a Victorian-styled mansion that still stands as a historical site in Tustin, CA. Matilda died in 1887. Hewes' second wife was Anna Lathrop, sister of Mrs. Leland Stanford.Memorial addresses on the life and character of Mrs. David Hewes, with the funeral services held at the residence of her sister, Mrs. Leland Stanford, San Francisco, Cal., August 6, 1892. (Memorial booklet with biography, 42 pages) Married in 1889, they also travelled overseas and additionally to Europe they spent parts of their eighteen months in the Orient and Mid-East. Anna died soon after in August 1892. David Hewes' burial vault.Hewes first started what arguably was his greatest accomplishment - the Hewes ranch near El Modena in Orange County when he moved there with Matilda. Called Anapauma, \\"a place of rest\\", it was a massive sheep ranch over with a large portion eventually converted in vineyards which later died off from blight. Hewes restored the ranch as a citrus farm which was one of the noted orange groves that stayed with the estate until 1920 when it was sold for $1,000,000. Hewes' art collection of pictures, statues and frescos was presented to the Leland Stanford Jr. University. He also created Hewes Park on what was once a barren hilltop. Hewes died in Orange, California in 1915 at the age of 93 and is buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. Hewes became very interested in his family genealogy, especially his ancestor Lt. Joshua Hewes who had emigrated from England to the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1633. He commissioned Eben Putnam, a California genealogist, to collect and edit material for a Hewes family genealogy. This volume, privately published in 1913, includes a biography of David Hewes (pp. 191-205), an autobiography (pp. 225-264), an appendix with a transcription of the memorial booklet for Anna Lathrop Hewes, and an appendix with letters from his mother, as well as many photographs and paintings of Hewes and his family members, his house in Tustin, and advertisements and labels for the fruit produced by his ranch.

Adak was placed in commission on 18 August 1989, at Bolinger Shipyard in Lockport, Louisiana. Adak and the other 48 s' construction are based on the internationally known Vosper-Thornycroft design. Her hull is a semi-displacement type monohull made of high-strength steel, while the main deck and superstructure are aluminum. Adak employs an active fin stabilization system to improve her sea-keeping abilities. With a top speed in excess of and a cruising speed of , the ship is capable of enduring unsupported operations for six days and accommodates three officers and nineteen enlisted personnel. Island-class patrol boat overview The 110-foot Island-class patrol boats are a US Coast Guard modification of a British-designed patrol boat. With excellent range and seakeeping capabilities, the Island class, all named after US islands, replaced the older 95-foot s. These cutters are equipped with advanced electronics and navigation equipment and are used on the front lines of the Coast Guard's maritime homeland security, migrant interdiction, fisheries enforcement, and search- and-rescue missions. The ships were deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. File:George&George.jpg;Former Presidents visiting ADAK. File:Liberty22.jpgADAK standing watch over New York Harbor. File:Transport22.jpgADAK being lifted on a transport ship, en route to the Persian Gulf. File:Thadcrew.jpgCG Commandant Thad Allen with crew of ADAK, 2009. Stateside Service- Prior to Deployment to Patrol Forces Southwest Asia Adak was originally stationed in Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Before Adaks commissioning ceremony in August 1989, in New Jersey, however, Adak had already completed six maritime rescues. After stopping F/V HUNTER off the coast of New York in 1991, Adaks boarding team found of cocaine worth over $861 million at the time. This was the third largest cocaine bust up to that date. On the evening of 18 September 1992, Adak rescued a missing diver off the coast of Shinnecock, Long Island. During her search for the missing diver from dive boat Captain Midnight, the crew saw a dim light, which upon investigation turned out to be the flashlight of the missing diver. The diver had been lost for five hours at that point. In August 1994, Adak took part in Operation Able Vigil, an effort made up of over 50 US Coast Guard and Navy ships, and many other varied assets, making up the largest Coast Guard led naval operation since World War II. From 19 August to 23 September 1994, Operation Able Vigil forces rescued over 29,000 Cuban migrants from unsafe rafts and makeshift craft. For her part in the operation Adak earned the Coast Guard Unit Commendation. In April 1996, while on patrol off Puerto Rico, Adak rescued 118 Dominican Republic migrants from two dangerously overloaded and unseaworthy boats.USCGC ADAK, Welcome Aboard pamphlet Adak was witness to the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, New York, on 17 July 1996. The cutter was only away when the crash occurred and immediately headed to the scene. Adak served as the On-Scene Commander for almost 100 rescue craft for the first eight hours of the search and recovery effort. For her actions responding to the TWA Flight 800 crash Adak received the Coast Guard Unit Commendation. During Adaks stateside service she conducted many successful fisheries patrols, enforcing maritime laws and treaties, and ensuring the safety of fishermen. In August 1999, she received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for her work from June 1997 to June 1999, doing Living Marine Resources patrols. During this time Adak issued eleven Magnuson Fishery Conservation Act violations, five of those resulting in catch seizures that, together, totalled over $160,000. After the attacks on the World Trade Center towers on 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard tug , homeported in Bayonne, New Jersey, was the first on scene in New York harbor and acted as On-Scene Commander. Adak arrived on scene an hour later and took over On-Scene Commander responsibilities. For hours Adak coordinated the evacuation of civilians, transport of firefighters and rescue personnel, and the establishment of security zones to protect other high valued assets from further attack. For her part in the response to the attacks of September 11, Adak received the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award. Initial actions during Operation Iraqi Freedom The maritime conditions of Iraq and the Northern Persian Gulf can greatly limit the operations of large naval vessels and warships. Due to this and the Navy's lack of in-shore patrol craft, a large part of the US Navy's request for Coast Guard assistance in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) centered on the service's shallow-draft patrol boats. Cutters of the 110-foot Island class, also known as WPBs, would serve as the mainstay of shallow-water operations. The deployment of the 110-foot patrol boat Adak serves as a snapshot of WPB operations in OIF. Deployment of the WPBs overseas would represent the first combat deployment of Coast Guard patrol boats since the Vietnam War, even though other Coast Guard assets had served in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in the 1990s. In early February 2003, the Coast Guard‚Äôs Atlantic Area Command deployed to the Persian Gulf the WPBs Adak, , , and . The 110s arrived in Bahrain, at the beginning of March, having ridden on board for thirty-five days. On March 5, a heavy-lift crane off-loaded the WPBs taking only six hours to set all four in the water. Adak ran through sea trials for two days and on 9 March, Adak and sister ship Aquidneck deployed to the Persian Gulf followed by Baranof and Wrangell on 12 March. In the days leading up to combat operations, Adak focused on maritime interdiction operations. Coalition vessels had restricted passage of local watercraft out of the Khawr Abd Allah (KAA) Waterway, thinking that these vessels might carry mines or escaping Iraqi officials. By mid-March, local watercraft had attempted several breakouts with fleets of dhows and small boats and, on 17 March, a large breakout consisting of sixty Iraqi watercraft attempted to evade Coalition units. With the vessels scattering in all directions, Adak, Wrangell, and their small boats, aided by other Coalition units, managed to corral all of the Iraqi watercraft and board them. None of the vessels carried escaping Iraqi leaders and all had discharged any illegal cargoes typical of small smuggling vessels. After boarding teams had thoroughly searched the dhows, Adak and the other patrol vessels allowed the watercraft to proceed along a specific route into the northern area of the Persian Gulf. In the early morning hours of 20 March, Coalition forces initiated combat operations with air attacks against key military targets in Baghdad. In addition, Coalition forces had to secure Iraq's Khor al-Amaya Oil Terminal and Mina al Bakr Oil Terminal to prevent environmental attack by the Iraqi regime. On the evening of 20 March, SEAL teams supported by Polish Special Forces personnel, stormed the oil facilities. During the operation, Adak, along with Baranof, maintained security around the terminals to prevent reinforcement or escape by Iraqi military forces. After the SEALs cleared the terminals of Iraqi personnel, weapons and explosives, Coast Guard personnel from Port Security Units 311 and 313 arrived to secure the facilities. Next Adak received orders to patrol the KAA Waterway, so by the early morning hours of 21 March, Adak had steamed up the KAA to serve as a guard ship. In fact, of the 146 Coalition naval units in the Persian Gulf, Adak stationed itself deepest in enemy territory and served as the \\"tip of the spear\\" for Coalition naval forces. During its early morning patrol, Adak and navy patrol surprised and stopped two down-bound Iraqi tugboats, including one towing a barge, and ordered them to anchor. At first, the vessels raised no suspicions for they ordinarily serviced tankers and smaller watercraft that plied local waters. But the two patrol vessels continued guarding the tugs and a special boarding team composed of Australian and American explosives experts searched the tugs and barge and found concealed within them a total of seventy contact and acoustic mines. Had they been released, the mines could have sunk or heavily damaged Coalition naval vessels operating in the Persian Gulf. The team secured the tugs and Chinook transported the tug crews back to a Coalition naval vessel for processing. The captain of one of the mine-laying tugs admitted that the sight of the \\"white patrol boat\\" had prevented him from deploying his deadly cargo. Throughout 21 March, the captain and crew of Adak experienced a great deal of excitement. At 06:00, Australian and British frigates began naval fire support operations in what became known as \\"Five- Inch Friday\\". The warships poured nearly 200 rounds of and shells into the Iraqi defenses while Adak screened the vessels to ensure that no unauthorized watercraft approached. During this time, Mackenzie and his men felt buffeting from the explosions of hundreds of bombs and shells lobbed on shore. British Royal Marines, supported by US Navy and Royal Navy hovercraft, commenced the amphibious assault on the Al-Faw Peninsula; the largest amphibious operation carried out since the Korean War. During the landings, an Iraqi PB-90 patrol boat had been cruising upstream on the KAA Waterway and positioned itself where it could threaten low-flying Coalition helicopters and provide early warning reports to land-based Iraqi forces on the Al Faw Peninsula. To engage the PB-90, the Coalition command center vectored in an AC-130 gunship, which destroyed the Iraqi vessel. Afterward, a Coalition helicopter spotted three surviving crewmembers floating down the KAA and notified Adak of their location. Adak conducted Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations, recovered three hypothermic Iraqis at 8:30, and transferred the prisoners to an Australian naval vessel for processing. Coalition experts later identified the men as warrant officers from Iraq's Republican Guard. After Coalition forces wrapped up the initial phase of combat operations, Coalition planners focused on opening the KAA Waterway to vessel traffic. Wrecks from the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and the First Gulf War still littered the KAA and its shores, but mines proved a greater concern. Some mines still remained in the waterway from Operation Desert Storm. Minesweeping operations began on 22 March, with navy Sea Dragon helicopters towing minesweeping sleds along the waterway. Mackenzie received orders for Adak to join sister ship Wrangell, and navy patrol craft Chinook and Firebolt to escort US Navy and Royal Navy minesweepers up the KAA. The process proved slow as the minesweepers proceeded at a rate of up the channel to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. The patrol boats had to stand off from the minesweeping vessels and they often had to station themselves upriver from the minesweepers. On several occasions, the minesweepers located mines in waters previously navigated by the WPBs and, on one occasion, Adaks crew listened as the patrol boat contacted a mine that came to the surface and failed to detonate. It took about a week to complete mine-clearing operations on the KAA and with Umm Qasr in Coalition hands, cargo vessels could begin steaming into the Iraqi port. Naval combat operations concluded near the end of March, but Adak joined the other WPBs to continue their force protection role and served as escorts while the navy salvage vessel and the tugboat removed obstructions in the waterway. On 28 March, Coalition forces sent the first shipload of humanitarian aid into Umm Qasr on board the shallow draft Royal Fleet Auxiliary Sir Galahad under the escort of Adak, Wrangell, a minesweeper and patrol craft . Adak and its crew continued escort duties along the KAA into early April. On 11 April, Adak escorted Iraq's first commercial shipment on board , which carried 700 tons of Red Crescent Society aid of food, water, medical supplies and transport vehicles. Meanwhile, Adak received orders to return to base and, on 12 April, Adak redeployed to Bahrain after completing a thirty-five-day non-stop deployment to the NAG. On 9 April, organized resistance had ceased in Baghdad, followed in mid-April by a cessation of resistance in most other Iraqi cities. On 1 May, President George Bush announced the end of combat operations in Iraq and the Coalition‚Äôs offensive operations came to a close. During OIF, Adak, its sister ships and their crews brought many vital capabilities to the theater of operations. The patrol boats operated for many hours without maintenance in waters too shallow for most naval vessels and served as the fleet's workhorses in boarding, escort duty, force protection and maritime interdiction operations. The characteristic white hulls of the WPBs also provided a less antagonizing presence in a highly volatile region. As in past Coast Guard combat missions, such as Vietnam, Coast Guard patrol boats and personnel exceeded all expectations in shallow- water and in-shore maritime operations. Given the frequency that hostilities erupt in the world's littoral regions, shallow-draft Coast Guard units and their specialized personnel will continue to play an important part in future naval operations.

It is written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Kelly Yates. It was first printed in June 2009 and features the Tenth Doctor and companion Donna Noble. Synopsis The Doctor is attempting to land the TARDIS on the planet Autopia, however he has difficulty in passing the barrier that is protecting the planet. After breaking through the barrier, he and Donna decide to take a look. The planet is perfect and the Doctor starts to wonder about a mission referred to as the Chronos Mission. He explains to Donna that the mission included five sentients who, like them, passed the barrier to invite the Autopians to rejoin the Universe. Inside, they discover robots everywhere. They perform all tasks. After forcing a robot to take the two of them to its mistress, the Doctor finds that there's nothing to do on the planet as, with the help of the robots, everything is perfect. The Doctor begs to differ, stating that everything is stagnant. He then finds out the five sentients were killed on arrival to the planet. The mistress informs them that all intruders die and that they are no exception. They are placed in the solar furnace, there to be incinerated. As the solar furnace begins to heat up, the Doctor talks to the robot. Donna names it Sam, after her cat. Sam is aware that what he is doing is morally wrong and wishes that he could stop it. Seconds before their death, Sam finally gives in and turns off the machine. Sam realises that he's committed so many of these crimes and asks the Doctor to end his life. Donna asks the Doctor to just upgrade him instead, however the Doctor tells her that all the robots are linked and that by giving one freedom, he will be giving them all freedom, and that that may have a catastrophic effect on the culture of Autopia. The Doctor gives in and decides to upgrade him and hours later, Sam finds himself able to ponder things that were before prohibited. He realises that he is not just a robot. He is a slave. Things get worse as all of the robots decide to take revenge by herding up the Autopians and preparing for their deaths. The Doctor makes Sam remember the lesson about killing being morally wrong and he understands. He releases them and promises to better his people. Donna reckons that the Autopians and Sam's people should work together and create a leisure planet, thus improving the culture of the planet and giving them something to do. The Doctor is stunned by how amazing the idea is and they return later for a quick sunbathe.

In 1899, he founded what would become Morinaga & Co, the first modern candy company in Japan, and the first to produce chocolates in the country. Now known for the popular fruit candy Hi-Chew, one of Morinaga & Co's first products was marshmallow. Early life Morinaga (1865‚Äì1937) was born on Japan's southern island of Kyushu. He had no formal education. His father died when he was 7. Later he became a potter's apprentice and went to Tokyo in his teens to sell pottery. He later became a branch manager for a wholesaler in nearby Yokohama, but his branch lost money after extending too much credit to customers due to leniency. Since employees were considered personally responsible for such losses, Morinaga searched for a way to repay his boss. With no local prospects found to repay the loss, Morinaga, at age 23, moved to the United States where he opened a hardware store in San Francisco. However, local boycotting due to his race caused his venture to be unsuccessful. During the visit, he also converted to Christianity. Candy pioneer in Japan During his time in the United States, an unidentified American gave him a piece of candy which was a new appetizing treat for Morinaga. Having led an impoverished life in Japan, Morinaga had never tasted such a delicious treat. At the time, candy in Japan was expensive and consisted of either boiled beans or bee honey, which was based on sweets originally brought by Chinese and Portuguese traders centuries earlier or even more expensive candy imported from Europe. Morinaga returned to Japan but came to the United States for a second time. He was unable to obtain candy apprentice jobs in the United States because of his race. Instead, he worked as a janitor in a candy factory to gain experience. After interviewing a number of Japanese people in the United States, Moringa discovered that marshmallows were popular but unavailable in Japan. This second visit to study candy manufacture lasted ten years. In 1899, he left the United States and initially sold candy from a push cart. Later that year, he opened a candy shop in Tokyo (Minato City), the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop (later Morinaga Confectionery), with Hanzaburo Matsuzaki, a business partner and fellow Christian. Morinaga later founded Morinaga & Co, the first modern candy company in Japan and the first to produce chocolates in the country when it started in 1918, one year after opening a company dairy. Morinaga is considered one of Japan's greatest industrialists who was not part of a zaibatsu. Early difficulties of the company included the fact that Japan had little commercial milk production, obliging the company to open its own dairy. Another difficulty was that Japan had little arable land for crops and no locally produced corn or sugar cane to make corn syrup. Currently, Morinaga & Co. is one of Japan's biggest candy makers, with 2008 sales of $1.5 billion and over 5,000 employees. The company also operates restaurants, coffee shops, cafeterias and golf courses in Japan. The affiliated company, Morinaga Milk Industry, sells powdered milk and other dairy products worldwide, as well as health food snacks. In 2008, Morinaga America, Inc. was opened in the United States. One of his early products were marshmallows, which he called \\"angel food\\" because of their color and the association with Christianity, his own religion. He developed a type of caramel called Hi-Chew which became one of his flagship products. Hi-Chew was less buttery and more resistant to melting in hot Japanese weather than the caramel formulations that he had seen in the United States. This new type of caramel appealed better to the Japanese taste. Legacy After the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, Morinaga led rescue efforts and also distributed sweets and dairy products to people displaced by the disaster and made donations for the purchase of rice to distribute to disaster victims. View of the destruction in Yokohama after the Great Kanto earthquake In 1944, Morinaga's company, with the Army Medical School of Japan, was the first to produce penicillin, an antibiotic drug, in Japan.

First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between Camuston and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule, it is a freestanding cross, rare in Eastern Scotland. The cross is thought to date from the tenth century, and exhibits distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy. Location The Camus Cross is in the Downie Hills, approximately northwest of Carnoustie in Angus, Scotland. It is situated at the centre of a long avenue leading east-north-east through Camuston Wood from the Panmure Testimonial to the Craigton to Carnoustie road, at (). The avenue is part of Panmure Estate and leads, beyond the road, to the former site of Panmure House. Description Shaft detail, showing foliar scrolls on southern edge The freestanding cross is carved from Old Red Sandstone and stands high, approximately wide at the base, wide at the arms, and approximately thick. It stands on a low earth mound, wide (east to west), wide (north to south) and high, in the centre of the Camuston Wood avenue, facing east to west. All faces and sides are sculpted. The cross has suffered significant weathering, most notably on the west face, which has obscured some of the designs. The stone bears no idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system, it is a class III stone. Intact freestanding crosses of this age are comparatively rare, perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage, and the only ones in Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood. The western face is divided into three sections. The uppermost section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the figure of a man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design. The Brechin HogbackThe eastern face is usually interpreted as a depiction of Christ flanked by angels above the four evangelists, although Robert Maule, in the earliest description of the stone, described the scene as Moses giving out the Law. The carving on the Camus Cross shows distinct similarities with those on the Brechin Hogback stone and point to an Irish Ecclesiastical influence. The foliar designs on the north and south edges, originally seen as Ringerike- like (and hence, Scandinavian in origin), consist of tendrils and volutes with \\"wave-crest\\" thickening. These features bear closest similarity with Irish insular art of the late tenth century, and the treatment of the symmetrical foliar scroll design on the lower portion of the west face is diagnostically Irish. The full-face figures on the east face are of an identical type to those on the Brechin Hogback. In the case of the Brechin Hogback, the figures are carrying objects that are characteristic of early medieval Irish monasticism. History The Camus Cross, west face Avenue leading to Camus Cross The Camus Cross is currently thought to be a late Pictish/early Gaelic era monument, dating from the 10th century. The earliest record of it is in a legal document of 1481, describing the boundary of the lands of Camuston, owned by Sir Thomas Maule, and the barony of Downy, owned by the Earl of Crawford. The boundary was described as running \\"a magna cruce lapidea de Cambiston\\" ('from the great stone cross of Camuston'). It was mentioned in the context of the Battle of Barry in Hector Boece's Historia Gentis Scotorum in 1527, and first described in detail by the antiquarian Robert Maule, who erected it at its present position in 1620, after moving it six feet to centralise it within the Camuston Wood avenue. Camus was the supposed leader of a Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised in the sixteenth century by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain at the point where the cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic. The name of the cross is likely to derive from the village of Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist by the time of the first Ordnance Survey map, published in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology. A burial disinterred in 1598, near the Camus cross, was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus: > Not far thearfra in the bank of Camstone, the zeir of God Im fywe hundrethe > nyntie and aught zeiris, thear wos ane greawe fownd withe ane bread stone on > eury quarter thearof efter the forme of ane malt cobile, quharin did ly the > heale bons of ane man of gryt statwre, the thee bone quharof ves neir als > longue as bothe the schank and thee bone of any reasonable man of this age, > the harne pan gryte, and vanted the palme bread of ane hand thearof, quhilk > had beine the straik as appeirithe of ane sword, it wes thought to heawe > beine Cames the chief mans bwriel. Little information of the burial exists, but goods found in the cist were kept at Brechin Castle. These were sketched by Jervise and are typical of Bronze Age artifacts, found fairly commonly in the area.

Symbolism: Gold (Yellow) recalls the Cavalry lineage of the unit. Gold is also emblematic of excellence and high achievement. The two horizontal black bars allude to wrought iron, inherent with Armor and the unit's numerical designation \\"2nd.\\" The Spartan sword or Xiphos represents the unit's courage, vigilance and preparedness to stand and fight at a moment's notice. The blue of the hilt is for loyalty. The Spartan shield or Hoplon signifies the unit's ability to receive and organize multiple attachments for combat and remain constantly ready to support global military operations. Red symbolizes valor, sacrifice and is the color of the Spartan warrior's cape. The Spartan army was one of the toughest on record and served as the standard for valor. The lightning flashes highlight the organization's inherent ability to support tactical missions with Intelligence, Signal and Military Police capabilities.

The mtDNA control region is an area of the mitochondrial genome which is non-coding DNA. This region controls RNA and DNA synthesis.Structure of the Mitochondrial Genome DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory It is the most polymorphic region of the human mtDNA genome, with polymorphism concentrated in hypervariable regions. The average nucleotide diversity in these regions is 1.7%. Despite this variability, an RNA transcript from this region has a conserved secondary structure (pictured) which has been found to be under selective pressure. The mtDNA control region contains the origin of replication of one strand, and the origin of transcription for both strands. There is also an open reading frame thought to code for 7s ribosomal RNA in humans but not in mice or cows, where it has been deleted. Distinction from D-loop The control region and mtDNA D-loop are sometimes used synonymously in the literature; specifically the control region includes the D-loop along with adjacent transcription promoter regions. For this reason, the control region is also known by the acronym DLP, standing for D-Loop and associated Promoters. Endurance study mtDNA control region haplotypes have been linked with endurance capacity in human subjects. A 2002 study sequenced the control region of 55 subjects and compared their haplotype with the increase in VO2 max after an eight-week training program. They found that different haplotypes were significantly linked with the subjects' endurance. It was speculated that this was because the control region affects replication and transcription in the mitochondria.

Both cases were related to alleged abuse of IBM's dominant position in the mainframe market. The first case followed complaints by mainframe emulator vendors T3 Technologies and TurboHercules, later joined by Neon Enterprise Software, and focused on the alleged tying of IBM's mainframe hardware to its mainframe operating system, potentially precluding customers from the execution of mission critical mainframe applications on non-IBM servers. The second case was an investigation begun on the EC's own initiative that looked into IBM's alleged discriminatory behaviour towards competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services. In its initial reactionhttp://www.networkworld.com/community/node/64143 to the EC's decision, IBM said that the allegations had been brought forward by \\"satellite proxies\\" of rival Microsoft.

Resolution  After losing related court cases in the U.S. against IBM, T3 and Neon withdrew their European Commission complaints in August, 2011.

She was named after Kamishima Island, a small island in Mie Prefecture, offshore Toba, Mie. She was the lead ship of the two-vessel . Building During the very final stages of World War II, in preparation for the anticipated Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands, the Imperial Japanese Navy saw the need to block the entrances to the Sea of Japan to protect Japan‚Äôs relatively lightly defended western coast. However, as almost all minelayers had been sunk by that time, an emergency program was begun to construct several small vessels for this task. Kamishima was launched by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal on June 12, 1945, and was commissioned into service on July 30, 1945. Operational history On completion, Kamishima was assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, but the surrender of Japan occurred only 15 days after her commissioning. She was removed from the navy list on September 15, 1945. From September 1945 through June 1947, Kamishima was used as a repatriation vessel, shuttling between ports in Korea and Shanghai, and Kyushu, returning demobilized Japanese troops and civilians. On October 3, 1947, the American occupation forces turned Kamishima over to the Soviet Union as war reparations at the port of Nakhodka, where she was subsequently commissioned into the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet and transferred to Vladivostok in October.

In 1964‚Äì1968 new chairs were formed: the Chair of social and political sciences, theoretical mechanics, foreign languages, metal technologies, machine tools and instruments, physics, general and theoretical electrics and physical education. At that time the affiliate trained specialists in the following specialties: mechanical engineering, metal- cutting machine tools and instruments, electrical measuring equipment and radio equipment. In March 1968 Polishchuk A.G., Ph.D. became director of the affiliate. The intense work on the necessary instrumentation of teaching rooms and laboratories, expansion of the teaching areas, replenishment of the teaching staff with Candidates and Doctors of Science, organization of the Extra-Mural Studies Department and creation of the chair affiliates at production was being conducted. In October 1985 Shabliy O.M., Sc.D was appointed director of the Ternopil affiliate of Lviv Polytechnic University. He initiated the opening of new specialties: technology and equipment of the welding production, automation of the technological processes and productions, instrumentation, biotechnical and medical apparatuses and systems; construction of the new teaching building was conducted. Due to the active and effective work of the headsand staff on 27 February 1991, Ternopil InstrumentationInstitute was created on the basis of the Ternopil affiliate of Lviv Polytechnic University, being the second higher educational institution of this directionin Ukraine. The first rector chosen by the staff was Shabliy O.M., Sc.D. At that time the Institute comprised 3 departments integrating 13 chairs. The general quantity of students was 2420. 150 teachers worked at the Institute, 76 of them being Candidates and Doctors of Science. Since April 1995 the educational institution has carried the name of the outstanding Ukrainian scientist and public man Ivan Puluj. In accordance with the decision of the InterbranchAccreditation Commission, in 1994 the Institute was accredited as a IV level educational institution. The creation of the Institute was a powerful impetus to the new quality changes and further growth. The restructuring of the economy of the region and the necessity of providing staff for overcoming the crisis helped change the orientation of the Institute and carry out its considerable structural reconstruction. The Institute has practically lost its narrow applied line gradually transforming into the multibranch higher technical educational institution. Considering the real developments and achievements of the staff, the Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ‚Ññ 1536 from 30 December 1996 approved the creation of Ternopil Ivan Puluj State Technical University on the basis of Ternopil InstrumentationInstitute. Academician Shabliy O.M. became the rector of the university. The university is an educational, scientific, engineering and cultural centre of the western region of Ukraine. Nowadays it is the only higher technical educational institution of the region providing the training of specialists of all qualification levels, Doctors and Candidates of Science for the region comprising also Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyy and Rivne. Since 1999 the university has been a full member of the European University Association ‚Äì an organization uniting more than 600 European universities, it also holds membership in the national association of rectors from 43 countries which is the main representative organ for the higher educational institutions in Europe. The European University Association is a consultative member of the Supporting group of the Conference of Ministers of Education from European countries. The university takes active part in fulfilling one of the main tasks of the association which is the creation of the European higher education space where students, teachers and scientists would be able to accomplish their own intentions and ideas on the basis of the established European educational norms. On 16 September 2005 Ternopil Ivan Puluj State Technical University joined the European Declaration of the higher educational institutions of the Magna Charta Universitatum comprising fundamental principles, rights and duties of the universities as the outposts of culture, knowledge and research and uniting more than 530 leading universities of Europe, among them 14 from Ukraine. By Decree of the President of Ukraine No. 1024/2009 dated 11 December 2009, the university was granted a national status with a corresponding change of name. The structure The range of specialties taught at the affiliate, institute and, finally, university has gradually extended, and presently the amount of specialties for bachelors, specialists and masters reaches the number of 20. Altogether they are united in 15 directions. 8 departments are functioning within the university: Computer Technologies Department, Department of Computer Information Systems and Program Engineering, Electrical Engineering Department, Food and Processing Production Department, Mechanical Engineering Department, Economy and Entrepreneurship Department, Department of Management and Business in Production, Department of Testing Instruments and Radio Computer Systems. The training is also conducted at the International studies centre and Pre-university studies centre. The re-training and skill upgrading is organized by the Post-graduate studies centre. The educational process is assured by 34 chairs. Among them there are 5 humanitarian chairs (Ukrainian Studies and Philosophy; Psychology in Production; Foreign Languages; Sports and Physical Rehabilitation and Physical Education); 3 fundamental chairs (Higher Mathematics; Physics and Mathematical Methods in Engineering); 4 all- engineering chairs (Graphic Modeling; Information Science and Mathematical Modeling; Construction Mechanics and Electrical Engineering) and 22 specialized chairs (Mechanical Engineering; Computer Technologies in Mechanical Engineering; Food Biotechnology and Chemistry; Food Technologies Equipment; Production Marketing; Production Management; Entrepreneurship Management; Computer Sciences; Machine Tools, Device and Machines Design; Technical Mechanics and Agricultural Machine Building; Illuminating Engineering; Welding Production Technologies and Equipment; Apparatuses and Testing Instruments; Biotechnical Systems; Automation of Technological Processes and Production; Computer Integrated Technologies; Energy-Saving and Energy Management; Power Consumption Systems and Computer Technologies in Power Industry; Radio Computer Systems; Economic Cybernetics; Economic Theory, Finance, Registry and Control). The following training centers are functioning at the university: Information technologies centre comprising the regional CISCO academy, regional centre for the certified specialists training on the programs of Microsoft IT √Ä√±√†demy and SUN Microsystems, the laboratory of the Shnaider-Electricenterprise and certification examination centre of the European Virtual University. The graduates of the academy receive certificates of the international standard. Ternopil Ivan Puluj Technical University also includes the Technical College in Ternopil and the Gusyatyn and Zboriv Colleges situated in Gusyatyn and Zboriv respectively. Presently the general enrollment of students, masters and post-graduate students in the university alone comprises around 6000 persons. The general licensed amount of full time bachelors is 945 persons, masters ‚Äì 325 and specialists ‚Äì 695 persons; the amount of distance studies bachelors is 900 persons, masters ‚Äì 320 and specialists ‚Äì 865 persons.

The organization's partners include nonprofits, health care leaders, policymakers, educators and the private sector. The Foundation operates within four focus areas: Maintain Healthy Bodies, Nurture Healthy Minds, Strengthen Community Health and Champion Health Equity. As of 2017, the Foundation had assets of $2.6 billion. It awarded $80 million in grants and contributions throughout Colorado the same year. History In 1995, HCA-HealthONE LLC began as a joint venture between various affiliates of HCA and Denver's HealthOne hospitals. The purpose and intent of the original joint venture was to strengthen and grow the HealthONE hospitals, while maintaining an ongoing commitment to community benefit and charity care. The HealthONE Foundation assumed the trade name of HealthONE Alliance in 1999. In 2006, HealthONE Alliance changed its name to the Colorado Health Foundation to reflect its work across the state and adopted the goal of making Colorado the healthiest state in the nation. In addition to its grantmaking, the Foundation operated five graduate medical education (GME) residency programs and three community programs. On Oct. 13, 2011, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers approved the sale of the Foundation's 40 percent equity stake in Denver-area's HCA- HealthONE LLC health care system for $1.45 billion.http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2011/10/13/attorney_general_approves_colorado_health_foundation%E2%80%99s_sale_hospital_assets_hc In 2013, it created and seed funded an independent 501(c)(4) advocacy organization, Healthier Colorado.[5] President and CEO Anne Warhover stepped down from the Foundation in 2014 after leading the organization for 10 years. Following a national search, President and CEO Karen McNeil-Miller joined the Foundation in Sept. 2015 from the Kate B. Reynolds Trust in North Carolina. In 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new strategic framework for grantmaking that implemented four focus areas to guide its efforts and impact throughout the state: Maintain Healthy Bodies, Nurture Healthy Minds, Strengthen Community Health and Champion Health Equity. The Foundation also adopted a set of cornerstones on which its work is based. They are: * We serve Coloradans who have low income and have historically had less power or privilege. * We are informed by the community and those we exist to serve. * We do everything with the intent of creating health equity.  Grantmaking  The Colorado Health Foundation funds impactful work that aligns with the organization‚Äôs 10 priorities: Primary Care; Children Move More; Early Childhood Social-Emotional Development; Youth and Young Adult Resiliency; Adult Recovery; Community Solutions; Food Access and Security; Affordable Housing; Advocacy; and Capacity Building. The Foundation makes grants through funding opportunities, a responsive grants program and rapid response funding. Grant application deadlines for funding opportunities and responsive grants are Feb. 15, June 15 and Oct. 15 each year. Applications for rapid response funding, meant to support short-term advocacy initiatives, are accepted on a rolling basis. Past Funding Initiatives Prior to 2017, the Colorado Health Foundation structured its funding activity across three long-term community outcome areas: Healthy Living, Health Care and Health Coverage. In 2016, the Foundation made a $3 million program-related investment to establish the Colorado Healthy Housing Fund. The revolving fund provides loans for new and existing affordable housing developments that meet predetermined healthy housing criteria and design features. In 2013, the Foundation invested $7.1 million in the public-private project, called the Colorado Fresh Food Financing Fund. The money helps retailers build and open grocery stores in food deserts, especially in low-income neighborhoods where fast-food restaurants outnumber grocery stores. In 2013, the Foundation supported the state‚Äôs expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and produced its own report showing the economic impact of Medicaid expansion to Colorado. In 2012, the Foundation launched Healthy Places, a $4.5 million initiative to inspire and support the development of healthy communities in Colorado. Three communities, representing an urban, suburban or rural environment, each received three years of funding to implement a set of community-led project recommendations that promote physically active lifestyles. In 2010, the Foundation announced it was investing $6.5 million to the Colorado Health Service Corps to repay student loans for doctors and other primary care health professionals in return for providing care in the state's most underserved areas.http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/ci_17362221 These professionals each make a three-year commitment to practice in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), rural health clinic or other safety net facility in a rural or underserved urban community. The investment to the CHSC was administered by the Primary Care Office of the Colorado Department of Health & Environment (CDPHE).

The Colorado Health Symposium Each year, the Foundation hosts the Colorado Health Symposium. The annual three-day event, formerly called the Dorsey Hughes Symposium, offers the chance to interact with cross- sector experts and dedicated professionals who are leading the way in addressing health equity. Registration typically opens in mid-May, with the Symposium in July or August. A related Symposium Unplugged event series hosted by the Foundation puts on daylong discussions on topics related to the annual conference. These events take place in smaller, more intimate settings in communities across the state. Both the Colorado Health Symposium and Symposium Unplugged events offer the livestreaming of select sessions for those unable to physically attend.  Dr. Virgilio Licona Community Health Leadership Award  The Dr. Virgilio Licona Community Health Leadership Award recognizes impassioned Coloradans who are finding innovative and effective strategies to overcoming community health barriers across the state. Honoring the life and legacy of late Foundation Board member Dr. Virgilio Licona, the award was established in 2016 following his passing.

Chiara Graduate School.Ugo Pagano Department of Economics, University of Siena.  Biography  Pagano graduated with a M.A. from the University of Siena in 1973. Subsequently, he received his PhD in Economics from Cambridge University where he was later to become University Lecturer and Fellow of Pembroke College. Pagano was the President of the Italian Association for the Study of Comparative Economic Systems and member of the Council of the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy. He is former founding editor of the Journal of Institutional Economics. Currently, Pagano is Professor of Economic Policy and Director of the PhD programme in Economics at the University of Siena where he teaches courses on Theory of the Firm, Law and Economics and Political Economy. He teaches also at Central European University, Budapest. In 1997 he was awarded the Kapp Prize for the essay 'Transition and the Speciation of the Japanese Model'Ugo Pagano Journal articles by the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy.  Work and research interest  In the first part of his career Pagano has challenged the long tradition that sees economics as a relation between means and ends. Within this context his main contribution has been to endogenise the definition of both means and ends, and to clarify that by considering only leisure as argument of the utility function is tantamount to assuming that workers are physical 'things' not different from iron instead of human beings. On the basis of this critique various welfare theorems could be re-stated: the sum of utilities and productivity of work instead of the utility alone have to be equal in each use; the technological efficiency is not any more an essential requirement for economic efficiency; and the maximisation of profit does not any more imply an efficient allocation of work. Following this line of research Pagano has enlarged the standard economic view about scarcity. In addition to standard material scarcity he has taken into account some dimensions usually neglected in mainstream economics among which social and intelligence scarcities. With reference to social scarcity Pagano has suggested a way of integrating the analysis of goods such as prestige and power in economic theory. This has been done by introducing a new type of good ‚Äì positional goods ‚Äì which have been defined as having the opposite character of public goods. The positive consumption of this type of good is possible only if corresponding negative quantities are consumed by other individuals. Pagano has shown that while public goods are typically undersupplied, positional goods are typically oversupplied. For what concerns instead intelligence scarcity he has suggested that bounded rationality has many dimensions each of which can be represented as a maximisation problem with some additional constraints, only at the cost of contradicting the scarcity assumption at a higher level. In the literature on the theory of the firm the main contribution of Pagano has been the development of the concept of organizational equilibrium. Combining the literatures of the Neo- institutional and Radical schools he has defined organizational equilibria as situations where a set of rights (technological characteristics of the resources) brings about technological characteristics of the resources (rights) which are consistent with this set of rights (technology). This concept is directly related to the Marxian concept of mode of production and has been lately adopted as a tool to study the evolution of organizational forms in knowledge-intensive productions. In the field of political economy, following the work of Ernest Andr√© Gellner, Pagano has established a link between nationalism and globalisation, highlighting similarities and discontinuities. Being strongly influenced by the Darwinian theory of evolution, Pagano has also done some works on bioeconomics. In a recent article, in particular, he has suggested that in the course of human evolution sexual selection supplied the development of human brain and intelligence. Pagano has been deeply involved in the debate concerning the economic crisis started in 2007. He has advanced the hypothesis that some of the roots of the crisis are to be found in the institutions of the knowledge economy, in particular the TRIPs, which have substantially increased the cost of investments. According to this interpretation, the possible remedies to the crisis should not only focus on monetary policy, financial regulations or even on standard Keynesian policies, but should be coupled with policies that decrease the level of intellectual monopolisation of the economy. On his personal website, Pagano says that as a Director of the PhD Programme in Economics at the University of Siena, he has tried to co-operate with his colleagues to organise graduate programmes where research students feel part of a community within which they make autonomous choices on their research.

Introduced as the Transtar 4000 in 1971, the model line was produced across three generations until 2017; following the incorporation of Navistar, the Transtar was rebranded as the 9000 series. Slotted below the Paystar range (in terms of size), the 9000 series was a conventional-cab truck configured primarily for highway applications. Produced exclusively in a Class 8 configuration, the Transtar 4000/9000 Series was offered in multiple layouts, including single or tandem rear axles, daycabs or multiple sizes of sleeper cabs. During the 2000s, International phased out much of the model line in favor of the newer ProStar and LoneStar; after a 46-year production run, the final 9900i was produced in 2017. __TOC__  First generation (Transtar; 1971-1985)  International Transtar 4300 (with trailer bus) For 1971, International introduced the Transtar 4200/4300 series as its heavy-duty conventional. Replacing the Transtar 400 (an update of the D-400 introduced in 1961), the 1971 Transtar introduced an all-new cab, replacing the \\"Emeryville\\" cab (introduced in 1957). The Transtar was offered in two model lines, the standard-hood 4270 and the long-hood 4370. The cab of the first-generation Transtar was adopted for the severe-service Paystar 5000; its doors were shared by the 9000-series COEs. A steel cab was standard; an aluminum cab was optional. At its launch, the Transtar 4200/4300 was offered with a range of diesel engines, with the 4200 offered with V8 engines and inline-engines for the longer-hood 4300. A Detroit Diesel 260 hp 8V71 V8 was standard on the 4270, with a 230 hp Cummins NH inline-6 standard on the 4370; the latter model was offered with a 434 hp Detroit Diesel 12V71 V12. The engines were paired with manual transmissions, ranging from 5 to 16 speeds (along with optional 4-speed auxiliary transmission). At the end of the 1970s, the 4300 was fitted with the largest diesel engines ever fitted in a road-going vehicle, including the 450 hp Cummins KT inline-6 (1150 cubic inches) and the Caterpillar 3408 V8 (1099 cubic inches).  Second generation (1985-1999)  1990s International 9400 Eagle farm truck 1998 International 9200 Eagle (facelift) Following the corporate transition of International Harvester to Navistar, the Transtar series underwent several minor revisions to the exterior and badging, with the model line becoming the International 9370. The 4270 was dropped, with the 9370 receiving a larger grille and hood (distinguished by vertically-stacked headlamps). In 1989, Navistar introduced several changes to the model line; in line with other International product lines, the 9370 was renamed the International 9300. For the first time, a set-back front axle configuration was offered. For 1990 the 9400 was introduced as the first aerodynamic conventional from International, using a set-back front axle and a sloped hood. While less radical than the Ford Aeromax or the Kenworth T600, the 9400 offered skirted fuel tanks as an option. In 1993, the 9200 was introduced (a shorter-hood version of the 9400); the set-back axle version of the 9300 was dropped. In mid-1990 the luxuriously appointed 9400 Super Eagle Limited Edition was introduced; offered only with the Caterpillar 3406 diesel engine it had a leather interior with wood trim and a fully color-coordinated exterior. In 1997, the 9100 was introduced; produced largely as a daycab. For 1997, International gave the 9000-series (outside of the 9300) a mid-cycle update, with a redesign of the grille, front bumper, and headlight surrounds. For 1999, the 9300 (derived from the 1971 Transtar 4300) was replaced by the 9900, pairing a squared-off long hood design with headlights faired into the fenders.  Third generation (i-series; 2000-2017)  International 9400i tow truck Previewed by the 1997 update to the 9000 series and the 9900, for 2000, the International heavy truck range underwent their most extensive redesign since 1971. While sharing its underlying aluminum structure, the firewall of the cab was moved forward (enlarging the drivers compartment). In place of the previous two-pane flat glass, a single-piece curved windshield was fitted, along with cowl-mounted wipers. To improve outward visibility, the cowl was lowered (along with the lower half of the door windows); vent windows were deleted. The third-generation 9000 series was denoted with an \\"i\\" suffix; as with its predecessor, it shared its cab with the Paystar severe-service trucks (renamed the Paystar 5000i). The model line consisted of the 9100i (112-inch BBC), 9200i (112-inch BBC), 9400i (120-inch BBC), 9900i (120-inch BBC), and 9900ix (130-inch BBC). Sold primarily for regional use, the 9100i was offered only as a daycab (no sleeper). In contrast to the rest of the sloped-hood model line, the 9900i and 9900ix were configured with straight hoods, and the 9900ix was offered only with premium Eagle trim. During the 2000s and early 2010s, International began to pare down the models of the 9000 series in favor of newer designs based on the NGV cab. After the 2002 model year, the 9100i was dropped (effectively replaced by the 8000 series). The 9400i and 9200i were discontinued after 2007 and 2011 (directly replaced by the ProStar). While far different in design, the 9900ix was functionally replaced by the LoneStar as the extended-hood International conventional.

This one-room schoolhouse was built in 1830 and was home to grades one through eight. It was operated by one teacher and one school trustee. Its former students restored it to its present condition after forming the \\"Greenfield Park Historical Association\\" in 1960. It became a museum on June 27, 1965 and named the \\"Greenfield Park Museum\\" or \\"Greenfield Park One Room Schoolhouse Museum\\". Many pieces of the memorabilia contained in the schoolhouse are original. The building is about 30 feet wide by 45 feet long. It has a large Pot bellied stove for heat, but has no electricity or water. The original two student desks with fold down seats are there, as well as ink wells and slate blackboard. There are small two-seater outhouses (boys and girls separate) on the outside, for girls on the left side and for boys on the right side of the building. Among the preserved memorabilia is a teacher‚Äôs contract of a $5 a week salary, plus 3 weeks paid vacation in the summer if the trustee felt like it. The names of all the teachers over the years were tabulated on a wall roster. The schoolhouse is located on Oak Ridge Road, right off New York Route 52, in the center of its Greenfield-Park stretch in the Catskill Mountains. History The date given when this building was erected is 1830, and records indicate that this schoolhouse was already in use prior to 1836. In those days, as throughout rural America, the school district for this community, known then as Greenfield, included this one room schoolhouse for all eight elementary grades, with one school trustee and one teacher. All the children of the community attended the one room school. Their number varied yearly but often there were more than 35 attending school. They ranged from the tiny tot, just entering first grade, to the teenager who had advanced to the eighth grade, all taught by the same teacher. School taxes as late as 1893 ranged from four cents to $8.90; and the school teacher who was usually unmarried, lived either at the home of the trustee or with one of the families in the school district, and received then a salary of $6 a week. The building was still in use in 1938 but ceased functioning shortly after when it moved to more modern facilities. Many of those boys and girls continued beyond the Greenfield school to become lawyers, doctors, and surgeons, some of national repute. Many others entered the hotel and resort business and are equally well known in their field of endeavor. The initial step to restore this schoolhouse was taken by Morris Kanfer, a pupil of this school. With the help of David Levinson and under the guidance and supervision of Ben Miller, both one time students of this school, the project was completed. Aaron Feldherr, postmaster of Greenfield Park was advisor, advocate and secretary-treasurer of the project from its inception. It was dedicated in June, 1965 and its oldest living pupil, Mary Patmore who was 96 at the time, cut a ribbon marking the official opening of the museum. Another pupil, Dr. Samuel Standard, a prominent surgeon and teacher, delivered the principal address. =Quaker Meeting House= Also as part of the museum is the Quaker meeting house right across the street from the museum, erected in about 1818 it is the oldest public building in the town of Wawarsing. The first settler came to Greenfield in about 1790. Within a year several families had moved there from the vicinity of Westchester County and were followed by others within a few more years. They belonged to the \\"Society of Friends\\" and were known as \\"Friends\\" or \\"Quakers\\". As the early Quakers died and their descendants moved away from Greenfield, before 1900 weekly services were replaced by one annual service, then abandoned entirely. In 1966 ownership was transferred to the town of Wawarsing who restored it to its present condition.

Heinrich Koenen was born in the Konigsberg district of Berlin, the son of Communist Reichstag deputy Wilhelm Koenen. He was selected as political head of the Young Communist League of Germany. He studied engineering at the Technical University of Berlin but for political reasons, was expelled in 1933 before his final examination. He emigrated via Denmark and Sweden to the Soviet Union, where he worked as an engineer in a Moscow tractor factory and in 1940, became a Soviet citizen. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, he volunteered for military service and was trained for use in Germany as a paratrooper and radio operator. He was given the task of restoring the broken links between the Moscow headquarters of the Comintern and the GRU and the Berlin group of the Red Orchestra. On 23 October 1942, Koenen parachuted behind German lines at Osterode in East Prussia and made his way to Berlin to his contact, Ilse St√∂be. On 29 October 1942, he was arrested by a Gestapo official waiting at St√∂be's apartment. Koenen was executed without trial at Sachsenhausen concentration camp in February 1945.

The premiere focused on the aftermath of the main characters' promotion to residency, following the conclusion of their internship. The episode was the first not to feature Isaiah Washington, portraying Preston Burke, due to his being fired from the series at the conclusion of season 3. The episode also marked Chyler Leigh's promotion to series regular status, following her guest appearances in the last 2 episodes of the previous season. Also featured were one-time guest actors Mark Pellegrino, Stephania Childers, Sandra Thigpen, and Steven Porter. The story arcs which provided a particular focus on individual characters include Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) dealing with the aftermath of Burke's (Washington) departure, and the dissolution of their engagement, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) struggling with her romantic feelings towards the married George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) learning to deal with her new position of Chief Resident. Also dealt with was Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) coping with Rebecca Pope's (Elizabeth Reaser) departure, and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) facing the conclusion of her relationship with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), while dealing with the arrival of her half-sister, Lexie Grey (Leigh), who enrolls in the surgical program at the hospital. The script for the premiere was written by series creator Shonda Rhimes, while Rob Corn served as the director. The episode aired on September 27, 2007 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with an approximated 20.93 million viewers tuning in. Ranking #2 in the time-slot and #3 for the week, the episode garnered a 7.3 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, seeing a decrease from the previous episode, which received an 8.0 rating. Critical response of the episode ranged from mixed to negative, with Yang's storyline being a particular source of critical acclaim from television reviewers. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California.  Plot  The episode opens to a voice- over narrative from Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about change, the episode's main theme. Following the conclusion of their internship, Meredith, along with her colleagues, Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) commence their residency in the department of surgery, and start dealing with new responsibilities, including the new generation of interns, to whom they have been assigned as mentors. After failing his post-internship exam in the season three finale, George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) must repeat his internship year, to avoid being forced to leave the medical field. It is revealed that among the new interns is Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister, who previously had an encounter with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), despite his unawareness of her identity. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), whom Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) chose for Miranda Bailey's (Chandra Wilson) righteous position of Chief Resident, finds difficulty in exposing an authoritative behavior, receiving little respect from her subordinates. It is explained that, in the aftermath of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in the unpleasant situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), following her departure. In the absence of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who relocated to Los Angeles, California, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Initially unwilling to resume his friendship with Sloan, Shepherd ultimately gives him a second chance. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being given the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives. The emergency room is filled with victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they come to the conclusion that even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.  Production  alt=A photo of Chyler Leigh, wearing glasses and a pink T-shirt, smiling at the camera. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" was written by series creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes, whereas filmmaker and series veteran Rob Corn served as the director. The soundtrack used in the episode included Mat Kearney's \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\", I'm from Barcelona's \\"Oversleeping\\", Meiko's \\"Reasons to Love You\\" and Cinematic Orchestra's \\"To Build A Home\\". Also featured in the episode was \\"Knock 'Em Out\\", the second track from British pop singer-songwriter Lily Allen's debut album, Alright, Still. Several one-time guest stars appeared in the episode, including Mark Pellegrino, who played Chris, Stephania Childers, portraying Nancy Walters, Sandra Thigpen in the role of Clara, and Steven Porter, who acted as Joey. Although fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming primarily occurred in Los Angeles, California. Scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. The season 4 premiere saw Leigh's first appearance as a main cast member. Leigh first appeared on the show during the last 3 episodes of season 3 as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Following Washington's departure, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie. She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for season 4. On casting Leigh as Lexie, Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes stated, \\"We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out. She had a quality that felt right and real to me. It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting.\\" Leigh offered her insight on her first days working with the main cast of the series, \\"It was like coming into somebody else's group or circle. It was a little daunting in the beginning. But I have had such a great time.\\" Also introduced in \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" is the new generation of interns, all of whom were portrayed in co-star capacity, with the exception of Lexie. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" was the first episode in 2 years not to feature the character of Montgomery, due to her portrayer, Walsh, leaving the series in order to launch the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, medical drama Private Practice. However, the character continued to be prominent throughout the run of the series, appearing sporadically as a guest-star in the following seasons. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" was the first episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, following an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which had been in the media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All?\\", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assessed, \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\\". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight.\\"Interview transcript\\" July 2, 2007. Cable News Network. While writing the episode, Rhimes put an emphasis on the character of O'Malley, detailing his relationships with both Stevens and Torres. On the topic, Rhimes elaborated, \\"The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman.\\" Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, \\"Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me.\\" Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former \\"off the hook\\" for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. \\"She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women. Whether they like it or not. This isn't gonna be an easy pill for Bailey to swallow.\\"  Reception  \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" was originally broadcast in the United States on September 27, 2007, airing on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in its regular 9:00 Eastern time-slot. Viewed by a total of 20.93 million viewers, the episode is the series' second most-watched season premiere, just behind the third season opener, which had been watched live by 25.41 million American viewers. In comparison to the previous episode, which was watched by 22.57 million viewers, \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" made a 21% decrease in terms of viewership. However, the viewership of the episode ranked second in both its time-slot and the entire night, being beaten out by its airtime rival, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on CBS, which was watched by 25.22 million viewers. In the entire week, the episode ranked third, being beaten out by both CSI and fellow ABC show Dancing With the Stars. In addition to being a success in viewership, the episode also did well in ratings. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" garnered a 7.3 Nielsen rating in household viewership, ranking second in its time-slot, and third for the week. alt=A photo of Sandra Oh in 2016. The premiere generally received mixed to negative feedback from television critics. Debbie Chang on BuddyTV deemed the episode \\"dysfunctional and ridiculous\\", being particularly critical of the story arc involving Stevens, whom she described as not being worthy of being promoted to the residency level. Chang expressed disagreement with the manner Bailey and Shepherd's characters were dealt with by the writers, feeling that the former's anger should have been targeted at herself, and criticizing the exaggerated exposure of the latter's \\"first grader emotional maturity\\". However, Yang's character was praised, with Chang choosing her manner of repressing her feelings as a highlight. Chang expressed a general disappointment in the episode, disapproving the choice for the episode as a season opener, a topic in regard to which she elaborated, \\"I can see already that this season will continue to bring us medical cases that are so blatantly about the doctors' pathetic lives.\\" In September 2009, the inclusion of the deer ranked #12 in Entertainment Weekly \\"Most Memorable Cases of Grey's Anatomy\\". Eileen Lulevitch, entertainment reviewer for TV Guide, was generally favorable of the episode, writing, \\"Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming an old friend back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and get caught up in all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Burke and Cristina's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them.\\" Lulevitch praised Meredith's story-arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, \\"When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode.\\" Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", Burrows elaborated, \\"The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to a whole new set of interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots.\\" Heigl, who portrayed Stevens, was particularly critical of her character's relationship with O'Malley, deeming it \\"a ratings ploy\\". Heigl further explained her outlook on the progression of her character, \\"They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now.\\" Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, \\"If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb.\\" Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a \\"cool, rocking, outgoing, confident and full-of-life\\" role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote \\"Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story-arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the \\"constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for 3 seasons before letting them kiss\\", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that \\"she's still being written as Meredith circa season 1 in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like.\\" The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from \\"the old show\\". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.

Elkind of North Miami Beach, Florida, United States, in 1975. Mr. Elkind, after retiring from the offshore racing circuits, became interested in the water skiing business. In the early 1980s American Skier became one of the first tournament boat companies to be approved for competition by the American Water Ski Association. The first 18' Skiers came out as 1976 models from a shop in Opa Locka Florida. In the early 1990s WESMAR took over ownership. They built the 1991-95 models in Ocoee, Florida, moved it to Cape Coral, Florida, and moved it again, this time to Giddings, Texas. Ron Tanis purchased the company in 1995 and moved the molds from Giddings to Winnsboro, Louisiana. Ron Tanis sold the company to the politician Jay Blossman, and the former professional water skier Ben Favret. Tanis had met Favret in high school. Ben and Jay renamed the company to Elan Boats.

The first boats to receive the changes were the Open Bow Volante, the Lazer, and the TBX. In 1999, the American Skier plant moved into a larger facility in Kentwood, Louisiana, where boat development continued. Modifications and additions were made to the boats, and the Lazer was renamed the Laz Air. In 2001 the company assets were sold to Ben Favret and Jay Blossman who changed the name to Elan Boats.

The tornado, which was the second ever tornado recorded in the Bronx, touched down around 2:55 p.m. EDT in Riverdale, located within the Bronx, causing damage to buildings, trees, cars, and power lines. Seven people were injured along its track due to broken glass. The tornado lifted around 3:00 p.m. EDT while still within the Riverdale neighborhood. The thunderstorm that spawned the tornado caused more widespread damage, with downed trees and power lines stretching from Bergen County, New Jersey to Suffolk County, New York. Roughly 4,700 Consolidated Edison customers were left without power following the event; all of whom had their electricity restored the following morning. Since 1950, when the Storm Prediction Center began keeping reliable records of tornadoes, only six other tornadoes have affected New York City, the strongest being an EF2 on August 8, 2007 in Brooklyn. Meteorological synopsis On July 25, 2010, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe thunderstorms in the Tri-State Region, with a near 2% chance of a tornado touching down within of a given area. An upper-level trough situated over eastern Canada tracked eastward and was accompanied by a cold front that trailed southward into the Mid-Atlantic states. Thunderstorms that began along the eastern Great Lakes, in Pennsylvania and upstate New York, moved southeastward towards the Atlantic seaboard along a low-level jet stream. The highest risk of tornadoes was in eastern Pennsylvania where low-level wind shear and high Convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were present. However, a less thermodynamic environment in southern New York led to a lower risk around New York City. Around 11:00 a.m. EDT, thunderstorms began developing along the cold front over central Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. These storms tracked generally towards the east-southeast and were noted as having a chance to develop into bow echo, leading to a high risk of damaging winds. This prompted the SPC to issue a severe thunderstorm watch for all of southern Pennsylvania, the entire state of New Jersey and parts of northern West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. Around the time the watch was issued, wind shear values began to decrease over the region; however, moderately strong winds persisted over a large area, fueling further development of thunderstorms. Ahead of these storms, surface heating from days of above-average temperatures (exceeding ) and a moist air mass provided significant instability, another factor favoring thunderstorm formation. Over the following hours, an isolated thunderstorm developed just outside the watch area and intensified. At 2:46 p.m. EDT, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Upton, New York issued a severe thunderstorm warning for much of the Tri-State Region. The storm was noted as having winds in excess of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it tracked east at 30 mph (45 km/h). Beginning in Bergen County, New Jersey, a line of wind damage took shape due to the storm as it moved ever closer to New York City. The storm continued to produce damage north of the city but the core entered the Bronx just before 3:00 p.m. EDT. At 2:55 p.m. EDT, a tornado touched down around 5901 Palisades Avenue along the east bank of the Hudson River. According to a resident who lived near where the tornado began, the funnel cloud preceding the tornado developed over the river. Tracking southeast, the tornado impacted a few structures, shattering windows and damaging roofs. The scale of damage to these structures was consistent with an EF1 tornado with winds around 100 mph (155 km/h) on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The system continued through the Bronx for roughly five minutes before it lifted near the intersection of Riverdale Avenue and 254th Street, about from where it began. Continuing across southern New York, the thunderstorm continued to produce wind damage through Suffolk County before moving offshore around 4:05 p.m. EDT. Impact and aftermath The thunderstorm that spawned the tornado left a trail of wind damage from northeastern New Jersey through Long Island along its nearly two-hour existence. Strong wind gusts, reaching 65 mph (100 km/h) in some areas, downed numerous trees and power lines across Bergen County. Several roads were also blocked after large trees toppled onto them. In Pedricktown, a large tree fell on a home and broke through the roof, allowing heavy rain to fall inside the structure. Similar damage took place in the Bronx where trees fell on cars, streets and power lines. Along the northern edge of the storm, strong winds in Yonkers also downed trees and power lines. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h) before the storm finally moved offshore. The tornado itself caused relatively little damage in comparison with the thunderstorm that spawned it. Several trees were destroyed by 100 mph (155 km/h) winds produced by the system and branches were snapped and littered across streets. A few of the downed trees struck the first floor windows of buildings, shattering the glass and leaving seven people with minor injuries. One tree was uprooted and \\"became a projectile\\" and was wedged within another tree nearby. One home also sustained significant roof damage along the tornado's track. Dozens of cars were totaled by downed trees along its path and thousands were left without power. According to Consolidated Edison (ConEd), 1,700 customers in Riverdale and 3,000 in Bronxside were without power due to the tornado. Additionally, there was also a microburst during the thunderstorm, associated with straight-line wind damage. Non-tornadic damage was estimated at $46,000. Total losses from the tornado were estimated at $150,000. Offshore, the storm left one sailing student missing after he fell overboard during a sailing lesson. Coast Guard teams continue to search for the man; however, there have been no signs of him as of July 28. The search was later called off and the sailor has been presumed dead. Although the storm brought significant damage, rains from it also helped end a growing drought issue and a significant heat wave in the region. Prior to the storm's passage, temperatures in New Jersey had reached the mid-s but fell into the range by 4:00 p.m. EDT. The heavy rains led to street flooding, creating widespread traffic jams, especially on the Henry Hudson Parkway. Following the severe damage caused by the storm, the NWS deployed a storm survey team on July 26 to the hardest hit area to determine if a tornado had struck. Their assessment was complete the following day and it was concluded that it was in fact a tornado that caused the most significant damage. Throughout the day on July 26, ConEd deployed crews throughout the Bronx to repair broken power poles and downed lines. By the evening of July 25, only 100 of the original 4,700 customers were still without power; it was fully restored to all residents the following day. Along Palisade Avenue, nearly half a dozen companies provided assistance in tree removal with wood chippers, cherry pickers and dump trucks to clear the streets. Due to the large amount of downed wires, residents living along Ladd Road north to Sigma Place were urged to remain in their homes for their own safety until ConEd crews had cleared the area. =Historical perspective= Since the SPC began keeping records of severe weather events in 1950, few tornadoes have touched down around New York City. Prior to the 2010 Bronx tornado, the most recent to hit the area were an EF1 and EF2 on August 8, 2007 which hit Brooklyn. In the Bronx, there has been only one other tornado confirmed to have touched down, the first was recorded on September 2, 1974. Four other tornadoes have been recorded within the city, one in each 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2003, none of which exceeded F1 intensity.

In a short period it produced a unanimously agreed report recommending an amiable solution to the long waged land war between tenant farmers and their landlords. Advocating a massive scheme of voluntary land purchase, it provided the basis for the most important land reform ever introduced by any Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the period of the Act of Union (1801‚Äì1922), known as the Wyndham Land Purchase Act 1903.Campbell, Fergus: Irish Popular Politics and the making of the Wyndham Land Act, 1901‚Äì1903 The Historical Journal , Cambridge University Press (2002).

W. MP: Notes on the Irish Land Bill in The North American Review, Vol. 176., No. 559, pp. 868‚Äì880 (June 1903). Land War as prelude There were three periods of particularly acute tension and conflict between landlord and tenant in the period 1877‚Äì1903. The first period 1877‚Äì82, a period of poor harvest, decreased demand for agricultural products and falling prices, saw the establishment of the Irish National Land League in 1879 followed by demonstrations, boycotting, no-rent campaigns, arrests, suppression and prosecutions during 1880‚Äì82. The Land Acts introduced in 1881 and 1885 alleviated certain needs, but by and large the grievances of the mass of tenant farmers went unheeded. A second period of agitation began with rent strikes in 1885 accompanied by the Plan of Campaign during 1886 to 1892. Land Acts in 1885 and 1891 provided for limited tenant land purchase, but as the acts were cumbersome and unwieldy they were little availed of by tenants. The third period of unrest was around the turn of the century, from 1898 to 1902, when, backed by intensified campaigns for compulsory land purchase of both William O‚ÄôBrien MP‚Äôs United Irish League (UIL) and T. W. Russell MP‚Äôs Ulster farmer‚Äôs organisation in 1901-2,Jackson, Alvin: Home Rule: An Irish History 1800‚Äî2000 p. 104, Phoenix Press (2003) tenants again agitated for concessions from their landlords. There was also a growing resentment at the landlord class as enunciated by Russell, who castigated their control of land as 'systemised and legal robbery'.Ferriter, Diarmaid: \\"The Transformation of Ireland, 1900‚Äì2000\\", Profile Books, London (2004), p. 108 () The Government was involved in the Land War only to the extent of enforcing its understanding of law and order chiefly in the interest of land owners. All the acts passed advanced the rights of tenants to some extent, but by the end of the century it was clear that the existing system of landlord and tenant ought to be replaced by a system of 'tenant proprietorship'.‚Äò'The Land War 1879‚Äì1903'‚Äô The National Library of Ireland (1976) Landlords take the initiative When the Chief Secretary for Ireland George Wyndham introduced a Land Purchase Bill early in 1902 which fell deplorably short of the necessities of the situation, the UIL wanted no paltry compromises and entered upon a virile campaign against the rack-renters. All the elements of social convulsion were gathering strength, when on 2 September 1902 a letter appeared in the newspapers from an unknown country gentleman.Sheehan, D. D.: Ireland since Parnell, p. 86-88, Daniel O‚ÄôConnor, London (1921). Captain John Shaw-Taylor (the younger son of a Galway landlord and a nephew of Lady Gregory's) set out a proposal for a landlord-tenant conference in the following terms: ‚ÄùFor the last two hundred years the land war has rages fiercely and continuously, bearing in its train stagnation of trade, paralysis of commercial business and enterprise and producing hatred and bitterness between various sections and classes of the community ‚Äú He went on to invite a number of fellow landlords and Irish Nationalist MPs to a Conference in Dublin at which ‚Äù An honest, simple suggestion will be submitted and I am confident that a settlement will be arrived at\\". Sheehan, D. D.: p. 89. What marked out Shawe-Taylor‚Äôs appeal was that Wyndham promptly endorsed it, and a group of moderate landlords came forward, balloted fellow-landlords, and received a mandate for negotiations.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, p. 65, Gill & Macmillan (1999) They were important because they articulated the desire of a small but highly influential group of centrist landlords who, in turn, were encouraged by the Dublin Castle administration.Jackson, Alvin: p. 104. They set up a Land Committee which produced four delegates to meet the tenant representatives. These were the Earl of Dunraven, the Earl of Mayo, Col. Sir Hutcheson Po√´ and Col. Sir Nugent Everard. It was entirely fitting that a scion of the original invader should be among those called to reverse the consequences of the Conquest. Among them, Dunraven soon emerged as a capable leader with a genuine sympathy for a settlement and an interest in Irish affairs transcending mere land questions.O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: William O‚ÄôBrien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The Land Conference p. 145, University of California Press (1976) Dunraven and Everand were among the few landlords to win election to county councils in 1899; Everard survived on Meath County Council until 1920.Maume, Patrick: p. 67. Nationalists name their terms During the summer of 1902 conciliatory advances were not entirely novel. On the Nationalist side, John Redmond MP, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, indicated on two occasions that he was in favour of conciliation, even if the landlords had to get better terms than they deserved from their history.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: p. 140. After publication of the Shawe-Taylor letter which proposed O‚ÄôBrien, Redmond, Timothy Harrington MP and Russell as the tenant representative, there was enough conciliation in the air to generate a scheme that would bring the parties together. Shawe-Taylor corresponded with both O‚ÄôBrien and Redmond on his initial difficulty in having the landlords take up the conference idea. However, by 19 September both agreed to throw in their support.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: p. 141. Shawe-Taylot had chosen his men well. There was now no turning back, the landlord deliberations having agreed on four delegates to meet the tenant representatives.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: p. 145). Dunraven and Redmond as leaders of their respective delegation drew up a scheme that would be fair to landlord and tenant alike. There was confidence that victory and new possibilities would result from such cooperation, Redmond reporting to O‚ÄôBrien that Dunraven himself had further ideas as to some kind of Home Rule afterwards.O‚ÄôBrien, J. v.: p. 145. O‚ÄôBrien outlined his views on the terms to be discussed at the Conference in a long letter to Redmond, advising against any elaborate agenda. Dunraven‚Äôs and O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs views coincided, the latter outlining details of an agreement with a formula which would regulate what amounts tenants should pay in annuities and what the landlord should receive in payment, the government to pay a gap-bridging bonus to the landlord for the shortfall, O‚ÄôBrien confident that a golden age of social peace was dawning.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: p. 146. Swift agreement reached The eight delegates finally met on 20 December 1902 with Dunraven as chairman and Shawe-Taylor as secretary, in a conference publicly hailed by Redmond as \\"the most significant episode in the public life of Ireland for the last century\\". After only six sittings, a unanimously agreed conference report proposing a vast purchase scheme along the lines framed by O‚ÄôBrien, seven of the eight of the tenant‚Äôs requirements were conceded outright, the eight covered by a compromise,Sheehan, D.

The Land Conference reached an amiable solution differing from the purchase schemes and provisions of previous land acts in one essential aspect, that sale was to be irresistibly attractive to both parties. The State should supply 'any reasonable difference arising between the sum advanced by the State and ultimately repaid to it'. This contribution was to be justified by the desirability of giving the occupier a favourable start on their new career as owner'.Miller, David W.: pp. 86‚Äì87. The report, in turn, provided the basis for the future land act. It seemed for a scant moment that both the historic land dispute had been resolved and the style of national politics had been redefined along new, conciliatory lines. The Land Conference Report was praised by O‚ÄôBrien as such, not merely its commitment to legislation, but also the new form of Irish politics it embodied, O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs 'conference plus business'.Jackson, Alvin: p. 108. The attention of Ireland was now riveted on the developments around the Conference Report, for what was to become the most revolutionary piece of legislation in Irish history, the Land Act of 1903.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: p149 Before the Land Conference Redmond and O‚ÄôBrien had preached \\"unity\\" and \\"conciliation\\". Nationalists, O‚ÄôBrien foremost, believed that the destruction of landlordism could only hasten Home Rule. The calm was first ruffled by Archbishop Walsh of Dublin, who, although the Bishop‚Äôs Standing Committee expressed approval of the Report, in letters to the Freeman‚Äôs Journal he challenged the accuracy of certain figures. O‚ÄôBrien in turn retaliated with an exchange of letters which only ended by mid-March when it became clear that the government would enact on the Land Conference proposal.Miller, David: pp. 87‚Äì91. There was to be no quiet revolution in Irish national politics. The omens were initially good: on 16 February the leadership of the League blessed the Conference (and the later Act), as did Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party. But these prospects were soon to be dashed by the chief adversary of the Conference, Redmond‚Äôs deputy John Dillon MP.Jackson, Alvin: p. 105. His detestation of landlords was well known, having publicly expressed his familiar view that the best way to deal with landlords was not to confer with them, rather to make life uncomfortable for them. Dillon regarded O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs enthusiasm for the Conference policy with deepening suspicion and had begun to diverge from the line taken by his friends, with consequences which in the long term were to be momentous.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 228. Act brings fortune and dissention Wyndham introduced his long-awaited bill on 25 March. Compared with all previous attempts to solve the intractable land question, this was daring, generous and ingenious.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 229. The prices to be paid would range from 18¬Ω years' purchase up to 24¬Ω years' purchase on first term rents (that is, rents settled by the Land Courts under the Act of 1881), or 21¬Ω to 27¬Ω years' purchase on second-term rents. The money was to be advanced by the State and repaid over 68¬Ω years by annuities at the rate of 3¬º per cent. The landlord was to receive a 12% bonus to stimulate sales, paid for out of Irish revenues, one of some features which aroused nationalist resentment.Lyons, F. S. L.: pp. 229‚Äì230. As the bill progressed through Parliament, O‚ÄôBrien became convinced that the conference method could bring other social reforms and secure unionist consent for limited self-government, developing into full Home Rule.Maume, Patrick: p. 66. Timothy Healy MP turned from sceptics to vigorously supporting the bill‚Äôs passage. He extravagantly hailed it as one of the most remarkable occurrences in his political life, and actively collaborated and discussed its provisions in private with Wyndham, the Irish Secretary.Callanan, Frank: T. M. Healy p. 451, Cork University Press (1996), O‚ÄôBrien was very prominent in the Common's debates on the Bill as his enthusiasm mounted. The deep divisions this created were initially kept in check but the opposition of Dillon, Michael Davitt, Thomas Sexton MP and his daily Freeman‚Äôs Journal to the collaboration between nationalists, landlords and a Conservative Government intensified.Callanan, Frank: p. 452. Dillon, Redmond reported with apprehension, was very opposed to the Bill, He does not want a reconciliation with landlords ‚Äì or anything less than their being driven out of Ireland.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 231. The criticisms of Sexton‚Äôs nationalist daily outmatched the lesser voice of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs weekly, the Irish People. Davitt emerged as an opponent of the future Land Act, not solely because he demanded nothing less than land nationalisation, also because he regarded the terms offered to the landlords as too favourable. By 7 May the bill had passed its second reading with a number of amendments by 443 votes to 26, a personal triumph for Wyndham. On 21 July the third reading was passed, the Bill only modified in minor ways by the House of Lords and by the middle of August it had become law. Almost immediately land purchase was enormously accelerated. Prior to 1903 a total of nearly 20 million sterling had been advanced for the purchase of 2 ¬Ω million acres. Under the Act of 1903, and the consequential Act of 1909, the position was completely transformed. When in March 1920, the Estate Commission reviewed the development since 1903 under these Acts, they estimated that 83 million sterling had been advanced for transferred, whilst a further were pending costing 24 million sterling.Lyons, F. S. L.: pp. 234‚Äì235. By 1914, 75% of occupiers were buying out their landlords, mostly under the two Acts. In all, under the pre-UK Land Acts over 316,000 tenants purchased their holdings amounting to out of a total of 20 million in the country.Ferriter, Diarmaid: pp. 62‚Äì63. It can be said, that with the Wyndham Land Act the state moved to subvent the process of land purchase in Ireland by means of state loans \\"as a healing measure\\". It was precisely the policy which Parnell enunciated in the 1880s.Bew, Paul: Ireland', The Politics of Enmity 1789‚Äì2006', p. 362, Oxford University Press (2007), Conference versus confrontation Although the Act resulted in vastly extended sales of entire estates ‚Äì and in this regard deserves to be characterised as revolutionary, the adversary campaign led by Dillon, Davitt and Sexton which claimed it was a landlord victory, created a climax of disillusionment. Not the Act was in question but the manner in which it was won by O‚ÄôBrien. The issue was ‚Äì should nationalists co-operate with a minority of Irishmen whose political background was so fundamentally different from theirs? The adversaries said no, O‚ÄôBrien said yes, pointing to the successful Land Conference as the precursor of further partnerships between nationalists and Unionists.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 235-236. A few weeks after the Act was passed, the precarious consensus achieved by the party was shattered by John Dillon who openly aired his hostility to the Land Act and its underlying premise that it could serve the cause of reconciliation between agnostic classes and conflicting parties during a speech to his constituents at Swinford, County Mayo. O‚ÄôBrien, who fervently believed in the power of conciliation and the conference approach, never forgave Dillon for his \\"Swinford revolt\\". It marked the end of a close friendship going back to the Plan of Campaign years in 1880s. Added aggravation came from Arthur Griffith who denounced the Land Conference as a landlord swindle and seized on Dillon‚Äôs reaction to prove the party self-confessed incompetents.Maume, Patrick:: pp. 66 and 68, note 206: from United Irishman, 12 September 1903. O‚ÄôBrien, who had up to then held the initiative, and saw Dillon wantonly attacking a policy which the Irish party and the UIL had approved of and which had begun to reap considerable advantages for the country at large, tried to use his influence with his party leader and conciliation colleague Redmond to crush the opposition of Dillon, Davitt and the Freeman‚Äôs Journal, but could not get the chairman to act. Redmond balked fearing a rupture with Sexton, Dillon and Davitt, all respected veterans of the Land War, would cause a split and the end of unity in the party.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 235-240. Dillon on the other hand, financially independent, could count on the support of Davitt, of Joe Devlin MP's Belfast machine and of the Irish organisation in Britain led by T. P. O‚ÄôConnor MP.Maume, Patrick: p. 69. The wider impact and fallout =Defeat for doctrine of conciliation= William O‚ÄôBrien, distressed and marginalised by Dillon‚Äôs assault, told Redmond on 4 November 1903 he was retiring from Parliament and the UIL Directory, withdrawing from public life and closing the Irish People. O‚ÄôBrien refused to reconsider, despite appeals from friends and allies His resignation was a very serious blow for the party at home and abroad. Membership lapsed, many UIL branches became extinct.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: pp. 161‚Äì163. O‚ÄôBrien embarked on a lengthy career of independent opposition to the Parliamentary party and although he briefly returned, together with Healy, in January 1908 in the interest of unity and to test the strategy of conciliation again, disappointment remained his lot.Jackson, Alvin: p. 109. Events had drawn the once estranged Healy and O‚ÄôBrien closer together, both now sharing a common foe, the party. Purged from it again by the Devlin instigated Baton Convention O‚ÄôBrien formed a new political organisation in 1909, the All-for-Ireland League, to defy the party and further the cause of national conciliation. When in 1917 Lloyd George and Redmond called the Irish Convention in an attempt to win over Ulster for a Home Rule settlement, O‚ÄôBrien declined an invitation to attend on the grounds that it could not succeed with a hundred and one delegates. His proposal to reduce the numbers to a dozen genuinely representative Irishmen from North and South, on the lines of the Land Conference, was not accepted, the Convention consequently ending as he predicted in disagreement.MacDonagh, Michael: The Life of William O'Brien, the Irish Nationalist, p. 231-232, Ernst Benn London (1928). =Devolution Crisis of 1904‚Äì5= The original centrist supporters of the Land Conference turned themselves into the Irish Reform Association, led by Dunraven. They contemplated the further development of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs policy of conciliation by providing a platform to explore the possibility of limited devolved government for Ireland,O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: William O‚ÄôBrien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, pp. 163‚Äì165, University of California Press (1976) heralding hopes for O‚ÄôBrien, that Ireland had somehow entered a new era in which 'conference plus business' could replace agitation and parliamentary tactics as a primary strategy for achieving national goals.Miller, David: p. 95. With the involvement of Wyndham, the reformists produced two reports in August‚ÄìSeptember 1904 on a scheme of ‚Äòdevolution‚Äô‚Äîthat is, for granting to Ireland limited powers of local self-government. It became known that the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Sir Anthony MacDonnell, a Mayo Catholic originally appointed by Wyndham, had also been involved in the plan. In Ulster Unionist eyes this added particular sinister significance to the whole affair, scented a political conspiracy and were outraged that a permanent official should dare to tamper with the sacred British connection.Lyons, F. S. L.: p. 273. MacDonnell claimed he had written to his superior Wyndham informing him, who failed to take particular notice of the letter. When in March 1905 Unionists launched their attack and Ulster resentment became overwhelming, Wyndham, by now a broken man, was forced to retire from office. Nationalist leaders taken by surprise by the Association's proposals, reacted ambiguously, Redmond at first greeted the devolution scheme, then sided with Dillon who was vehemently against it, regarding the Irish party as the only standard bearer of self-government. Anything less than the fulfilment of the full demand for self-government was dangerous, because accepting less might postpone true self-government indefinitely. Instead the two leaders bent their energies on sounding out where the Liberals stood on the Home Rule issue in the forthcoming general election. The Dunraven group were atypical of their cast, but for a time combined with O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs sense of nationalism and Healy‚Äôs opportunism, produced with the Land Conference‚Äîone of the most sustained and extensive attempts at unionist-nationalist co-operation in the twentieth century.Maume, Patrick: p. 67-68. On the other hand, the Dillonite dogma of hostility towards any form of reconciliation or conference between agnostic classes and conflicting parties, that is, towards any collaboration with the hereditary enemy at any level, precipitated into subsequent events on the political stage in Ireland up to the end of the century. Notes Category:History of Ireland (1801‚Äì1923) Category:Land reform in Ireland Category:Irish nationalism ","title":"Land Conference"},{"id":"28182266","text":"The causes of the Dutch Revolt and the ensuing Eighty Years War, considered to have started in June 1568, were a number of incidents and frictions had accumulated between the Dutch provinces and their Habsburg overlord. Causes of the war The direct cause of this war was similar to the slogan, No taxation without representation. Under the Habsburgs, the Low Countries were formally named unceremoniously \\"De landen van herwaarts over\\" and in French \\"Les pays de par de√ßa\\". Translated, the phrases mean \\"those lands around here\\" for the Dutch, and \\"those lands around there\\" for the French. While they were being taxed beyond what they were willing to pay, these far-away provinces were being continually admonished for seeing to their own business without permission from the throne, which at that time was indeed far away, in Spain. Each request for special permission would take at least four weeks for a response from Spain. This unrest over taxation without representation was amplified by a strong presence of Spanish troops brought in to oversee the order in these provinces. Meanwhile, a parallel religious revolt was seen as a direct threat to the (Roman Catholic) Spanish throne, by the spread of the Anabaptism of the Dutch reformer Menno Simons and the teachings of foreign Protestant leaders like Martin Luther and John Calvin, culminating with the Beeldenstorm, a country-wide outburst of iconoclasm in 1566. The date for the formal start of hostilities is often cited as the execution of the statesmen Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, on the main square in Brussels on June 5, 1568. This double execution for their failure to defend the regent Margaret of Parma from the armed incursion by 300 nobles presenting the 'Compromise of the Nobility' on 5 April 1566. was just the beginning of a wave of destruction, seen as a counter-attack to the Beeldenstorm, by Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba across all of the provinces. This episode ended poetically, four years later, in the total destruction of Lamoral's home in the (far) north, Egmond Castle, along with the neighbouring Egmond Abbey. Events leading to rebellion =Abdication of Charles V as Philip II becomes king= When Emperor Charles V began the gradual abdication of his several crowns in October 1555, his son Philip II took over as overlord of the conglomerate of duchies, counties and other feudal fiefs known as the Habsburg Netherlands.Technically they formed the Burgundian Circle that, under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, was to be transferred as a unit in hereditary succession in the House of Habsburg. At the time, this was a personal union of seventeen provinces with little in common beyond their overlord and a constitutional framework painfully assembled during the preceding reigns of Burgundian and Habsburg rulers. This framework divided power between city governments and local nobility, provincial States and royal stadtholders, and a central government of three collateral councils,the Council of State, Privy Council and Council of Finances assisting (usually) a Regent, and the States-General of the Netherlands. The balance of power was heavily weighted toward the local and regional governments. Like his predecessors, Philip II had to ceremonially affirm those constitutional documents (like the Joyous Entry of Brabant) before his accession to the ducal throne. Beyond these constitutional guarantees, the balance of power between local and central government was guaranteed by the dependence of the central government on extraordinary levies (Beden) granted by the States-General when ordinary tax revenues fell short of the financing requirements of the central government (which occurred frequently, due to the many wars Charles waged).Cf. Koenigsberger, pp. 184-192 =Increasing Spanish influence in the Netherlands= Though he was in the Netherlands Unless otherwise indicated, \\"Netherlands\\" and \\"Netherlandish\\" refer here to the entire area of the Habsburg Netherlands and its inhabitants, whereas \\"Dutch Republic\\" and \\"Dutch\\" will refer to the country, currently known as the Netherlands, and its inhabitants. in January, 1556, Philip II did not assume the reins of government in person, as he had to divide his attentions between England (where he was king-consort of Mary I of England), the Netherlands, and Spain. He therefore appointed a governor-general Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, and subsequently from 1559 on, a Regent (his half- sister Margaret of Parma) to lead the central government on a day-to-day basis. As in the days of Charles V, these regents governed in close cooperation with Netherlandish grandees, such as William, Prince of Orange, Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, and Lamoral, Count of Egmont. But (other than Charles) he also introduced a number of Spanish councillors in the Council of State, foremost Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, a French-born cardinal. These people gained a preponderant influence in the Council, much to the chagrin of the Netherlandish old guard. When Philip left for Spain in 1559 (as it turned out, permanently) the central government therefore already experienced political strains, and those were exacerbated by the question of religious policy. Like his father, Philip was a fervent enemy of the Protestant teachings of Martin Luther, John Calvin, and the Anabaptists. Charles had legally defined heresy as \\"treason against God\\" (or French l√®se- majest√© divine) an \\"exceptional crime\\" that was outside the purview of normal legal procedures as laid down in the Netherlandish legal privileges. He therefore outlawed heresy in special placards that made it a capital offense, to be prosecuted by a Netherlandish version of the Inquisition. Between 1523 and 1566, more than 1,300 people were executed as heretics, far more relative to the overall population than, for instance, in France.Tracy, p. 66 These placards, and the policy of repression of heresy in general, were highly unpopular, not just with prospective adherents of the Protestant faiths, but also with the Catholic population and the local governments, who considered it an intrusion on their prerogatives. Towards the end of Charles' reign, enforcement had therefore become quite lax. Philip, however, insisted on rigorous enforcement and this caused more and more popular unrest. In the province of Holland, for instance, there were riots in the late 1550s during which the mob freed some condemned persons before their execution.Tracy, p. 68 To support and strengthen the attempts at Counter-Reformation, issuing from the Council of Trent, Philip launched a wholesale organizational reform of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands in 1559 (with Papal approval). This amounted to the introduction of fourteen new dioceses instead of the old three. This new hierarchy was to be headed by Granvelle as archbishop of the new archdiocese of Mechelen. The reform was especially unpopular with the old church hierarchy as the new dioceses were to be financed by transferring a number of rich abbeys that were traditionally in the gift of the high aristocracy. The new bishops were to take the lead in the enforcement of the anti-heresy placards and to intensify the Inquisition.Tracy, pp. 68-69 =Dutch nobility in opposition= Granvelle's perceived aggrandizement helped focus the opposition against him. The grandees under the leadership of Orange engineered his recall in 1564. Emboldened by this success Orange intensified his attempts to obtain religious toleration. He persuaded Margaret and the Council to ask for a moderation of the placards against heresy. Philip delayed his response, however, and in the meantime the opposition against his religious policies gained more widespread support. When Philip finally rejected the request for moderation in his Letters from the Segovia Woods of October, 1565, this only fanned the flames. A group of members of the lesser nobility, among whom Louis of Nassau, a younger brother of Orange, and the brothers John and Philip of St. Aldegonde, prepared a petition for the abolition of the Inquisition for Philip. This Compromise of Nobles was supported by about 400 nobles, both Catholics and Protestants. It was presented to Margaret on April 5, 1566 at an audience for about 300 members of the Compromise which Margaret found rather intimidating. (According to legend the petitioners were dismissed as gueux (beggars) by one of Margaret's courtiers; the rebels would later use that name as a rallying cry). Margaret was sufficiently impressed to order the suspension of the placards pending Philip's final decision on April 9.Tracy, pp. 69-70 =Unrest and Spanish military reaction= The suspension of the placards emboldened the Protestants. Many returned from exile. Calvinists started to organize open-air sermons outside the city walls of many cities. Though these meetings were peaceful, their size alone caused anxiety for the authorities, especially as some of the people attending bore arms. Then, the situation deteriorated rapidly. On August 1, 1566, 2000 armed Calvinists tried to force entry to the walled town of Veurne. Shortly thereafter Calvinist weavers from the industrial area around Ypres attacked churches and destroyed religious statuary. This iconoclastic fury () spread like wildfire across the Netherlands. The authorities at first did not react. The central government was especially disturbed by the fact that in many cases the civic militias refused to intervene. This seemed to portend insurrection. Margaret, and also authorities at lower levels, made further concessions to the Calvinists, like designating certain churches for Calvinist worship. However, the provincial governors, foremost Philip of Noircarmes of Hainaut, who suppressed the revolt of the Calvinists led by Guido de Bres in Valenciennes, and Orange as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, took decisive action to quell the disturbances. In March 1567 at the Battle of Oosterweel a motley army of Calvinists under John of St. Aldegonde was defeated by a royalist army and all rebels summarily executed, while Orange prevented the citizens of nearby Antwerp to come to the rebels' aid. In April, 1567 the situation in the country was such, that Margaret could report to Philip that order had been restored.Tracy, pp. 71-72 However, news travelled slowly and the court in Madrid had received a rather exaggerated impression of the severity of the situation. In September, 1566 Philip had decided to travel himself to the Netherlands to restore order, but debate among the two factions at the Spanish court, led by the Duke of Alba and the Prince of Eboli, about the advisability of this journey grew fierce. Eventually it was decided to send an army from Italy under the command of Alba. Margaret's emissary arrived at the court on April 17, 1567, the same day when Alba departed on his mission, too late to prevent the fateful interventionTracy, p. 72 Alba's army of about 10,000 Spanish and Italian mercenaries reached the Netherlands by way of the Spanish Road in August, 1567. Alba was supposed to act as military governor-general, while Margaret would remain in office as Regent. Alba acted in such a presumptuous way, however, that Margaret soon resigned in protest. Alba thereafter was in sole command. He commenced by establishing a Council of Troubles on September 5, 1567. This council soon conducted a severe campaign of repression of suspected heretics and people deemed guilty of the already extinguished insurrection. Many high-ranking officials were arrested on various pretexts, among whom the Counts of Egmont and Horne. The victims of the repression were found in all social strata. A total of about 9,000 people were eventually convicted by the council, though only 1,000 were actually executed, as many managed to go into exile. One of the latter was Orange, who forfeited his extensive possessions in the Netherlands, like most of the people being proscribed. The victims were not necessarily only Protestants. For instance, the Counts of Egmont and Horne, executed for treason on June 5, 1568, protested their Catholic orthodoxy on the scaffold.Tracy, pp. 77-78 =Opposition in exile= The many exiles found asylum in the few areas in neighboring countries that welcomed Calvinists, like the Huguenot areas in France, England, and Emden or Wesel in Germany. Many were ready to join an armed fight, but the fate of the rebels at Oosterweel had shown that irregular forces did not stand a chance against well-disciplined troops. A better organized effort was needed to lead such an effort, and Orange was uniquely well-placed. As a sovereign prince of the Holy Roman EmpireThe principality of Orange in present-day France at the time was an independent fief of the Empire. Orange was in a sense the equal of Philip, in his capacity of Count of Holland, for instance. Orange was therefore entirely within his rights to make war on Philip (or, as he for the moment preferred, on Philip's \\"bad advisor\\" Alba). This was important in a diplomatic context as it legitimized Orange's efforts to hire mercenaries in the principalities of his German \\"colleagues,\\" and enabled him to issue letters of marque to the many Calvinist seamen who had embarked on a career of piracy from economic desperation. Such letters elevated the latter, the so-called Sea Beggars, to the status of privateers, which enabled the authorities in neutral countries, like the England of Elizabeth I, to accommodate them without legal embarrassment.As a matter of fact, the English probably welcomed the opportunity to obtain cargo and ships at fire-sale prices, when the privateers came to dispose of their prizes; the arrangement was mutually beneficial. Orange's temporary abode in Dillenburg therefore became the command center for plans to invade the Netherlands from several directions at once.Tracy, p. 78 Louis of Nassau crossed into Groningen from East Friesland and defeated a small royalist force at Heiligerlee on May 23, 1568. The Battle of Heiligerlee is usually considered the start of the Dutch revolt as it was at this moment that the series of protests and unrest had culminated in armed conflict.

Based at Bridge End Field, Ebbw Vale were one of the first professional Welsh teams, and the last to disband in 1912 after the failure of the Welsh League. Ebbw Vale produced seven players who would go on to represent the Wales national rugby league team, and were seen as the only Welsh team of the time who could challenge the Northern League. Formation The Ebbw Vale rugby league team was the first club in Wales to 'turn professional' being founded on 15 July 1907,Lush (1998) pg. 24 the same month that Merthyr Tydfil RLFC formed. The team formed out of Ebbw Vale RFC, an amateur rugby union team, whose members were enraged at the \\"...bogus amateurism in the Monmouthshire League\\". Rugby union, led by the Welsh Rugby Union in Wales, had strict laws, barring all players to accept any wages or expenses to play the union code of rugby. This rule was often broken, to not only keep players at a club, but also to prevent them from \\"Going North\\", to join the professional Northern League in England. Ebbw Vale made a stand, and after a meeting at the Bridge End Hotel in the town, the club voted 63-20 in favour of adopting professionalism and joined the Northern Union. The switch to professionalism had been orchestrated by their secretary, William Evans, who not only steered the club to adopting Northern Union rules, but had also won guarantees from the NU Committee that the club would be paid ¬£10 for every match played in the north. Evans was made secretary of Ebbw Vale Rugby Football Club Company Ltd., and the company was formed with capital of ¬£250. The Welsh Rugby Union reacted by suspending all players, officials and the club for life. The Northern Union tried to counter this, by stating that no South Wales players would be allowed to switch to northern professional clubs unless refused places by Ebbw Vale and Merthyr first. Honours *Welsh League: 2 **1908-09, 1909‚Äì10 Club career =1907-1908= Ebbw Vale's first fixture as a professional club was against Keighly at Lawkholme Lane, on 7 September 1907, losing 26-3.

The Swinton match was played in front of 2000 home supporters, while matches against Halifax in January 1908, and Barrow in February, saw crowds of around 4000. Ebbw Vale finished their first season with 30 games played in the Northern League, six won, two drawn and 22 lost, finishing 26th out of 27 clubs.Lush (1998) pg. 25 The 1907-08 season was also notable for the first overseas touring international team to visit Britain; New Zealand's All Golds. The All Golds had already beaten Merthyr in November 1907, and New Year's Day 1908, the team played the Wales rugby league team in the first true international rugby league game between two nations. Played at the Athletic Ground in Aberdare the game was watched by a crowd of 12000. Ebbw Vale supplied two of their players to the Wales team, Chick Jenkins and Oliver Burgham, both men becoming the club's first international caps.Haynes (2007), pg. 141 On 1 February, Ebbw Vale faced the same touring New Zealand team at their own ground, losing narrowly.Ebbw Vale vs. New Zealand Rugby League Project On 20 April 1908, Burgham and Jenkins won their second caps with the club in the first Wales encounter with England; and were joined by teammate W.J. Saunders who won his first cap.Gate (1986) pg. 141 =1908-1909= The next season saw four more Welsh teams join the Northern Union, and with these additional teams the country was able to form the Welsh League. The League consisted of a home and away game, and the team joining Ebbw Vale and Merthyr were Treherbert, Mid-Rhondda, Aberdare and Barry. In addition the Union promised each team four home and away games with teams from the north. It was an excellent first season for Ebbw Vale in the Welsh League, only losing to Treherbert in the last match of the tournament, when the title was already theirs. Gate receipts rose that season, with the Northern League encounter with Merthyr reportedly watched by 8,000 people; though when Barry failed to show on the 1908 Christmas Day encounter, the club lost an estimated ¬£80 to ¬£90 in takings. Ebbw Vale finished the season, not only the very first Welsh League Champions, but also finished 14th out of 31 teams in the Northern Rugby League, with 12 wins, a draw and 11 losses. The only blemish to the season was being dumped out of the Challenge Cup by amateur team Beverley. This was Ebbw Vale's first entry into the Cup, and their first round exit was described by the Athletic News as a 'Welsh disaster'. Ebbw Vale would be the last professional team to be beaten by an amateur team in the Challenge Cup until Beverley repeated the feat against Highfield in the 1994‚Äì95 season. At international level Ebbw Vale again supplied a player to the Wales national team, Jack Foley in an away match with England. Although they did not play an international against Wales, the Australia team that toured Britain during this season, did schedule games against both Merthyr and Ebbw Vale. Ebbw Vale played the Australians on 18 January 1909, losing the match 8-9. =1909-1910= The 1909/10 season saw Ebbw Vale share the Bridge End Field with Ebbw Vale AFC, the local football team. Ebbw Vale again won the Welsh League, but after Mid-Rhondda, Barry and Aberdare all wound themselves up, only three clubs survived to contest the tournament. The club performed slightly worse than the previous season in the Northern League finishing 17th out of 28 clubs, with nine wins, two draws and 13 losses. The highlight of the season for Ebbw Vale this season was their run in the Challenge Cup. Their first team they drew in the Cup was Merthyr, and in front of a crowd of 4000, Ebbw Vale won their first Challenge Cup match winning 12-7.Lush (1998) pg. 27 The next round, Ebbw Vale were given an away tie at Huddersfield, the first encounter between the clubs. Ebbw Vale's victory over Huddersfield was seen as a shock result, to which the Athletic News later reported, 'NU club football in South Wales has, with one exception, made little progress. That exception is Ebbw Vale,' In the quarter finals of the Cup, Ebbw Vale were drawn at home to Salford, but gave up home advantage to play at Salford's ground. Ebbw Vale lost 8-2, ending their most successful cup run in the club's history. Two international matches were played by Wales this season, both against England; and Ebbw Vale were represented in both, by Foley in the first and Lewis Llewellyn, Jenkins and Foley in the second. The second encounter with England was held at Bridge End Field, the first rugby league international to be played at the ground,Eugene Cross Park Rugby League Project and Jenkins was given the captaincy in a 39-18 victory for the Welsh. Another honour achieved by the club during the 1909/10 season was the inclusion of \\"Chick\\" Jenkins in the very first over-seas tour of the Great Britain team.Gate (1986) pg. 163 Led by James Lomas, Jenkins was one of seven Welshmen selected for the tour, but he was the only player to be selected directly from one of the Welsh teams. Jenkins played in ten matches of the tour, scoring three tries and four goals, but was never selected for any of the Test matches. =1910-1911= With the withdrawal of Treherbert as a rugby league club, the Welsh League came to an end, with only Merthyr and Ebbw Vale remaining from the six Welsh clubs. They experienced a difficult start to the Northern Rugby League, with just one win from the first seven games, but a good run through October and November saw the team achieve wins over Runcorn, Hunslet, Coventry and Halifax. After a win over Merthyr on Boxing Day, the club then went into a slump, losing 13 games in a row, which was only halted on the last game of the season when they beat York. Ebbw Vale finished the season with nine wins from 30 matches, ending 25th out of 28 teams. Ebbw Vale again entered the Challenge Cup, this time going out in the first round to Batley. Wales played two more international games this season, and Ebbw Vale fielded three players in both games, Jenkins, Llewellyn and Foley. The first game was played away at Coventry, while the home match was again played at Bridge End Field. =1911‚Äì1912= 1911‚Äì12 was to be Ebbw Vale's last season, Merthyr Tydfil having folded at the end of the previous season, leaving Ebbw Vale as the lone representative rugby league team in Wales. The start of the Northern Rugby League campaign saw Ebbw Vale lose the first five matches, and their form did not improve much throughout the season; winning just four games, drawing three and losing 23. They ended the season 25th out of 27 clubs, and in April, towards the end of the campaign, they failed to field a complete team of 13 players in matches to Halifax and Hull Kingston Rovers.Lush (1998) pg. 28 The team also failed to get past the first round of the Challenge Cup, this time losing 10‚Äì2 to Halifax. A second touring Australian team came to Great Britain during the season, and although the team did not play against Ebbw Vale, they came to Bridge End Field to face Wales. Ebbw Vale supplied three players to the Wales team, Jenkins, H. Smith and G Hitchings; Jenkins was again given the honour of captaining the national team. The second Wales game of the season, held against England at Oldham, saw the last two players to represent Wales from Ebbw Vale, Jenkins and Llewellyn. Dissolution In August 1912, a month before the new season was about to start, the club lost two key members; Llew Llewellyn switched to Wigan and W. Higgins moved to Hull. Rumours began to circulate that the club finances were in a poor state, and the Merthyr Express reported that the club may not start the coming season. Despite the rumours, Ebbw Vale were expected to begin their programme with an away match to Huddersfield on 7 September. However, two days before the game it was announced by the club that they would not be able to send a team and that Vale had resigned from the Northern Rugby League, and the club disbanded.

The Queen Anne residence was built on the north side of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad railroad station before Clarendon Hills was even platted. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. However, a Catholic church purchased the property in 2002 so that it could expand, and the house was demolished shortly thereafter. History Henry C. Middaugh was a Chicago banker who purchased in the Village of Clarendon Hills in 1869. The land was just north of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. When Clarendon Hills was platted in 1873, Middaugh was acknowledged as one of the first residents. He later served as DuPage School Director and was a member of the DuPage County Board of Supervisors. Aside from his banking ventures, Middaugh made his fortune by producing lumber and sash window frames. His brick house was two-and-a-half stories tall on a stone foundation. The Queen Anne style house featured a tower, typical of Queen Anne houses of the time. A square porch in the front had elements of Romanesque Revival. The only major alteration occurred in the 1930s, when a second porch was added when the house functioned as a senior citizens. The house featured twenty rooms with hardwood floors. The main hall had a carved, winding staircase to the second floor. The dining room had a small, simple fireplace of mosaic tile. A dumbwaiter could carry food and drink to the upper floors. The third floor was used as a ballroom with a door to the tower, allowing a view of the property. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 21, 1978. Middaugh's property was, at some point, sold to the Sisters of Christian Charity. This piece of property was sold in 1953 so that Bishop Martin McNamara could build the Notre Dame Church to serve the needs of the growing Catholic community in Clarendon Hills. They intended to build an expansion to the church that would require the destruction of the historic house. The Henry C.

One of the earliest figures in the history of art in Birmingham, he was the first of the Birmingham School of landscape artists. Life and career Bond was baptised in Stroud, Gloucestershire in July 1725 and probably educated at The Crypt School in Gloucester, where his uncle was an usher. He married Susannah Hodgetts at St Philip's, Birmingham in 1758. He was apprenticed as a painter of japanned and papier-m√¢ch√© goods to Henry Clay in Birmingham, and from 1757 was in charge of the ornamental department of Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory. Nothing is known of Bond's artistic career until 1761, when he exhibited a landscape drawing after Claude Joseph Vernet at the Society of Artists in London. Between 1762 and 1769 he exhibited over 30 landscapes at the rooms of the Free Society of Artists, exhibiting further works in 1775 and 1780. He won 25 guineas in 1764 for the second best landscape in the exhibition, and in 1765 he won 50 guineas for the first prize. His productions are described as highly finished landscapes, broad in treatment, after the style of Wilson, R.A.. He seems to have amassed property enough to live a retired life during his latter years. He died at Hagley Row, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 18 December 1803. In 1804, a few months after his death, a number of his pictures and drawings were sold by auction in London. He was the elder brother of the composer Capel Bond.

The film was produced by Harold Huth, with cinematography from Jack Cox and screenplay by Roland Pertwee. They Were Sisters is noted for its frank, unsparing depiction of marital abuse at a time when the subject was rarely discussed openly. It was one of the Gainsborough melodramas. Background Unlike most of the hugely successful melodramas made by Gainsborough during the mid-1940s, They Were Sisters has a near-contemporary rather than a costume setting, spanning the years from the end of the First World War, to the late 1930s. The screenplay was developed by Pertwee from a popular novel of the same name by Dorothy Whipple, published in 1943. They Were Sisters features the spouses of both Mason and Calvert; Pamela Mason (billed under her maiden name Pamela Kellino and playing Mason's daughter, despite being only seven years younger) and Peter Murray-Hill. Mason later admitted that he acted most of his bullying, sadistic role with a permanent hangover as a result of his using drinking as a means of dealing with the frustration he felt from his role and the British film industry in general. Plot The film focuses on the lives of three sisters; Lucy (Phyllis Calvert), Vera (Anne Crawford) and Charlotte (Dulcie Gray). It opens at a dance in 1919, establishing their personalities and following them through courtship and marriage. While the sisters remain close to one another, their characters and paths through life are very different. Lucy is the most stable, sensible, practical and in a happy marriage, whose greatest sadness is her inability to have children, which she sublimates by lavishing affection on her nephews and nieces. Vera is married with a child but the relationship is humdrum and loveless and she is restless and bored, indulging her appetite for adventure and excitement through a series of flirtations, which sometimes go beyond the bounds of the socially acceptable. Charlotte is a cowed drudge, suffering emotional abuse at the hands of her manipulative, brutal husband Geoffrey (James Mason), who belittles and humiliates her in front of their three children. The film shifts between the three households but its main focus is the way in which Lucy and Vera have to look on, unable to provide effective help despite their best attempts, as Charlotte's treatment by her husband (who, it is strongly implied, is also engaging in an unhealthy relationship with their elder daughter) becomes ever more shocking and she descends into alcoholism to blur her despair. A final attempt by Charlotte to flee Geoffrey ends in tragedy. Vera's marriage, too, crumbles as her husband discovers her in a serious extra-marital relationship and petitions for divorce. The film ends by showing Charlotte's and Vera's children being cared for by the childless Lucy.

There is an entrance porch that is closed on three sides. On each side of the porch is a large door. The reason for this double entrance dates back to the days when the men and women separated at the church door and did not sit together as they do now.Marilyn Yalom, A History of the Wife , (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) Some of the notable items regarding Hebron Church include: *above ground burial vaults from the early days of the cemetery. *a school (Academy) located on the church grounds *a number of Revolutionary War Veterans interred in the cemetery. *nineteen young men from the church were killed during the American Civil War.Rev.

Notable members of the congregation or Academy attendees James Ramsey, Sr., a charter member of Hebron, settled on the Hudson River half a mile from Hebron and built the mill that long bore his name. This mill was one of the first industrial centers in this whole section of the state. There furniture, caskets, wagons, buggies and farming implements were made. It was for a long time one of the most thriving trading posts for miles around. At that time, Augusta, Georgia was the only town of any consequence where commerce could be carried on. James Ramsey is believed to be one of the Colonels who marched in the procession at George Washington's funeral.Mary Langford White. Hebron Presbyterian Church...Early History 1796-1846 1956Newspaper: \\"The Lavonia Times and Gauge\\", Historical Edition Celebrating the 150th. Anniversary of the Creation of Franklin County, Georgia February 23, 1934 Examples of Southern Appalachian culture Mrs John Carlan, a daughter of Mrs. Martha Williams Bellamy and a niece of Mrs. James H. Glasure gathered long smooth runners of the wild Japanese running honeysuckle that grew near her home. After carefully selecting the runners of uniform size she \\"skinned\\" each honeysuckle runner and soaked them in water until they were very soft and pliable. Taking these long soft runners, she skillfully wove by hand two round baskets six inches in diameter, two inches in height, finished with a beautiful scallop and a row of double weave. On the outside bottom of each basket she fastened a handle of wood that measured one inch wide, three- fourths inch thick and sixty inches long. Then she lined the bottom of the baskets with a piece of the best cloth she had. She gave these two beautiful baskets to the church to be used in the \\"taking up\\" of the collection. The deacons passing from row to row would lift the baskets over the heads of the people, then lower the baskets to a height where each could put money into the basket. This custom continued until about 1918 when the handles were removed. Those old woven baskets have now been replaced with modern collection plates. Hebron had the distinction of having one minister, the Rev. Groves H. Cartledge, serve as pastor for 47 years (1852‚Äì1899). He was noted for his learning, doctrinal views, eloquence and power. The Methodist Church of Liberty at Fort Lamar invited him to preach on the subject of \\"Baptism\\". His zeal for sound doctrine led him to speak for four hours. It was in the summertime and the weather was hot. After he had spoken for about three hours he became conscious of the fact that his gutta-percha buttons were melting, and that he was about to be divested of part of his wearing apparel. Determined to finish, however, he gathered his trousers together with one hand, confining his gesticulations to the other, and in that attitude finished his sermon. Hebron Academy During 1819 the first Sabbath School (later Hebron Academy) at Hebron, and perhaps the first one in upper Georgia, was organized and put into operation by licentiate John Harrison, of Jackson County, Georgia. The plan of the school was drawn up by Mr. Harrison. It became the model for many other churches. The white people were formed into classes and the negro slaves were taught to read with the consent of their masters. Records say that many slaves were taught to read, and were instructed in the \\"Shorter Catechism\\" and the Bible. This sabbath school flourished for a number of years, until the abolition movement became so great that the state legislature in self-defense passed a law forbidding the teaching of negro slaves to read. This cut them off from the sabbath School. The school continued for the white students. James H. Glasure, served as Superintendent of the sabbath school for more than twenty years. He was also an elder of the Hebron Church.

In 1582, he published Les Trois Mondes, a work setting out the history of the discovery of the globe.Arthur Augustus Tilley, The Literature of the French Renaissance, Volume 2, p.220 Les Trois Mondes In writing Les Trois Mondes, La Popelini√®re pursued an explicit geopolitical design by utilizing the cosmographic conjectures, which were at the time quite credible, to theorize a colonial expansion by France into the austral territories. His country, eliminated from colonial competition in the New World after a series of notorious checks in the Americas, could only thenceforward orient her expansion toward this ‚Äúthird world‚Äù. He affirmed this explicitly, in declaring ‚Äúto the ambition of the French is promised the Terre Australe, a territory which could not but be filled with all kinds of goods and things of excellence‚Äù (Les Trois Mondes, p. 50). The purely commercial interest of certain French maritime expeditions in the eastern seas was overtaken by a colonial project that foresaw the settlement of a French population in the Antipodes and the creation of a true ‚ÄúFrance australe‚Äù.Paolo Carile, ‚ÄúLes r√©cits de voyage protestants dans l‚ÄôOc√©an Indien au XVIIe si√®cle: entre utopie et r√©alisme‚Äù, Ana Margarida Fale√£o et al. (eds.), Literatura de Viagem: Narrativa, Hist√≥ria, Mito, Lisboa, Edi√ß√µes Cosmos, 1997, pp. 47-58, n.b. pp. 53-54. With regard to the austral lands, La Popelini√®re was inspired by the voyages of Drake, as well as by the accounts of a Portuguese pilot, Bartolomeu Velho, and by a cosmographer of Italian origin, Andrea D‚ÄôAlbagno.Dictionnaire de Biographie fran√ßaise, tome 1, 1933, pp. 1144-5, ‚ÄúAlbaigne‚Äù. La Popelini√®re evoked in eloquent terms this unknown ‚Äúthird world‚Äù which would complete the Old World and the New World: > There still remains the representation of the third world, of which you > would have no knowledge other than that nothing is known about it except > that it is a land extending towards the South, or Midi, from thirty degrees > beyond the Equator, of much greater extent than the whole of America, only > discovered by Magellan when he passed through the strait that is the passage > between the Austral land and the southern quarter of America to go to the > Moluccas...

La Popelini√®re joined a number of his contemporaries in this conception: Guillaume Le Testu, Jean Alfonse, Guillaume Postel, Andr√© Thevet.Anne-Marie Beaulieu (ed.), Les Trois Mondes de La Popelini√®re, Geneve, Droz, c1997, p.460. According to him, if France discovered and colonized this third part of the world, the Terra Australis, an unknown and immense land, she would be able to efface the grave fault of not having set foot on the New World since the time of Christopher Columbus. Les Trois Mondes is an invitation to exploration, to adventure, and an appeal to those Frenchmen who would wish to go in the footsteps of Columbus, of Magellan, of Cortes and of Drake. La Popelini√®re said: ‚Äúthere remain more countries to know than we moderns have discovered‚Äù. He even set out the means in explaining that it would not require the finances of a monarch but those of a simple gentleman of means. In fact, La Popelini√®re had had before his eyes a memoir which developed the hypothesis of an Austral continent. Its author, Andr√© d‚ÄôAlbaigne (or D‚ÄôAlbagno), had continued the project of his brother Francesque and of a Portuguese pilot, Bartolomeu Velho, in 1571. The cosmographer Andr√© d‚ÄôAlbaigne claimed to possess: ‚Äúthe secrets, charts and necessary instruments for conquering and reducing to the obedience of His Majesty great extent of lands and realms abundant and rich in gold, silver, precious stones, drugs and spiceries‚Äù.Anne- Marie Beaulieu (ed.), Les Trois Mondes de La Popelini√®re, Geneve, Droz, c1997, p.52. Italo-Portuguese work on a hypothetical continent Francisque and Andr√© d'Albaigne were merchants from the Italian city of Lucca. Their name was ‚ÄúDalbagnio‚Äù, according to a notary act of the year 1567, involving their brother Pellegrino, resident at La Rochelle since his marriage to the daughter of the mayor Vincent Nicolas. From Lisbon, where he was an agent of the Bonvisi, Francisque d‚ÄôAlbaigne betook himself to Paris, to propose the occupation of a ‚Äúcertain very rich new land of very great extent not yet discovered by the kings of Spain and Portugal‚Äù. He had suborned from the service of the Portuguese the cosmographer Bartholomeu Velho, who came to ‚Äúdemonstrate‚Äù to King Charles IX the situation of this unknown country. However Velho died at Nantes on 28 February 1568, and was soon followed to the grave by Francisque. Andr√© d‚ÄôAlbaigne took up the proposal of his brother. Warmly recalling how France had come to regret having dismissed Christopher Columbus, he now also promised the discovery of a new part of the world, at seven months voyage, with ‚Äúrealms abundant and rich in gold, silver, precious stones, drugs and spiceries‚Äù.Dictionnaire de Biographie fran√ßaise, tome 1, 1933, pp. 1144-5, ‚ÄúAlbaigne‚Äù; sourced from Hamy and La Ronci√®re, Histoire de la marine fran√ßaise, tome 1, pp.127, 259. No doubt Andr√© d‚ÄôAlbaigne had inherited from Velho some certainties regarding this hypothetical continent. La Popelini√®re, who was inspired by his memoir, specified in 1582 that what he was concerned with was ‚Äúa land stretching from the South, or Midi, to thirty degrees from the Equator, of much greater extent than all of America, only discovered by Magellan when he passed through the strait between this Austral land and the southern quarter of America to go to the Moluccas‚Äù.Charles Andre Julien, Les Voyages de D√©couvertes et les Premiers √âtablissements, Colonies et Empires, 3eme. s√©ries, Histoire de l'Expansion et de la Colonisation fran√ßaises, tome 1, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 1948, pp.267-8. Although the geographical destination of this enterprise was not plainly stated anywhere in the relevant correspondence, the chief modern authority on the matter, E.-T. Hamy, suggested that the real purpose, though concealed in vague and cryptic language, was to explore and colonize the unknown continent of Terra Australis. As Kenneth Andrews has commented, this thesis cannot be proved, and has evidently failed to convince some other authorities, but it must be taken seriously in the light of references to Francesco's project contained in the dispatches of Michel de Castelnau de la Mauvissi√®re, French ambassador in London, during the period 1577-1580 when he reported on the voyages of John Frobisher, Humphrey Gilbert and Francis Drake. Reporting upon the return of Drake in November 1580, the ambassador mentioned Francisque d‚ÄôAlbaigne in connection with Drake's alleged sighting, after passing the Cape of Good Hope, of ‚Äúune des terres australles et meridionalle qui ne sont descouvertes‚Äù, the same lands d‚ÄôAlbaigne had proposed for conquest.K.R. Andrews, ‚ÄúOn the way to Peru: Elizabethan ambitions in America south of Capricorn‚Äù, Terrae Incognitae, no.14, 1982, pp.61-75, p.68-69; Kenneth Andrews, Trade, Plunder and Settlement:Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480-1630, Cambridge, Cambridge U.P., 1984, pp.138-40. =Motivations of the Italo-Portuguese project= What the real objects of the Italo-Portuguese project were it is impossible to determine. Velho's 1561 chart of the New World is remarkable for its authoritative treatment of Brazil, La Plata, and Peru. It shows ‚ÄúPotosi‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúValdepariso‚Äù in Chile. South of the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego appears as in the conventional form of an ambiguous tip of a potential continental mass otherwise not delineated. Velho was evidently much more interested in South America than in Terra Australis, but such map evidence carries very little weight.K.R. Andrews, ‚ÄúOn the way to Peru: Elizabethan ambitions in America south of Capricorn‚Äù, Terrae Incognitae, no.14, 1982, pp.61-75, p.68-69; Kenneth Andrews, Trade, Plunder and Settlement:Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480-1630, Cambridge, Cambridge U.P., 1984, pp.138-40. The world map in the Cosmography that Velho compiled in 1568 for the benefit of King Charles IX at the request of Francesco d‚ÄôAlbagno is noteworthy for not having any representation whatever of the southern continent, which would appear to confirm that he had no interest in Terra Australis.Myriem Foncin, ‚ÄúSome Manuscript Maps Recently Acquired by the D√©partement des Cartes et Plans of the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris‚Äù, Imago Mundi, vol.15, 1960, pp.40-45; Armando Cortes√£o and Avelino Teixeira da Mota, Portugaliae Monumenta Cartographica, Lisbon, 1960-1962, p.91. =Discoveries linked to the hypothesis= Castelnau first mentioned ‚Äúd‚ÄôAlbaigne‚Äù in October 1577 when reporting Frobisher's alleged discovery of gold mines. He thought these vast gold-bearing lands ‚Äúvers le Nort‚Äù must be those d‚ÄôAlbaigne had offered to acquire for Charles years before. In July 1578 he reported that one Gilbert (Humphrey Gilbert) had the queen's permission to make an expedition ‚Äúpar la partie australe o√π il y a une infinit√© de terres inhabit√©es d‚Äôautres que de sauvaiges et qui sont en mesme paralelle et climat que la France et l‚ÄôAngleterre et au plus loing de quarante cinq et cinquante degrez de l‚Äôequinoctial, tirant √† l‚Äôautre Pole, o√π il y a √† faire des Empires et des Monarchies les quelles choses Gilbert en a communicqu√© avec moy (by the southern part where there is an infinity of lands uninhabited except for savages, which are in the same latitude and climate as France and England and at a distance of forty-five tofifty degrees from the Equator, taken from the other Pole, where there are empires and kingdoms to be made; which matters Gilbert had spoken about with me)‚Äù. Gilbert had added that he thought the Marquis de la Roche had the same object in mind, but that the land in question was quite big enough for everyone: whoever arrived first should take the left hand or the right hand course as he pleased, leaving the alternative to the other. Castelnau observed that this was Francisque d‚ÄôAlbaigne's proposal, which the late Gaspard de Coligny had often talked about to him, Castelnau, and that it would not involve touching Spanish or Portuguese possessions, since their conquests would be left to the right and the left, following ‚Äúla droicte ligne du Midy apr√®s avoir pass√© l‚Äôequinoxe (the direct course to the South after passing the Equator)‚Äù. Furthermore, cosmographers who had written about it and pilots who had been there said it was ‚Äúle derriere de la terre ferme pour aller par tout le monde (the last continental land reached in all the world)‚Äù. Having some knowledge of the matter from d‚ÄôAlbaigne himself and from other pilots in addition to what he had learned when in Portugal, Castelnau ended his report by offering to lead an expedition there in person. Finally, in November 1580, reporting upon the return of Drake, the ambassador again mentioned Francisque d‚ÄôAlbaigne in connection with Drake's alleged sighting, after passing the Cape of Good Hope, of ‚Äúune des terres australles et meridionalle qui ne sont descouvertes (one of the undiscovered austral and southern lands)‚Äù, lands the Italian had proposed for conquest. Unfortunately, a France exhausted by the French Wars of Religion was hardly in a state to respond to La Popelini√®re's maritime and colonial proposals.Numa Broc, \\"De l‚ÄôAntichtone √† l‚ÄôAntarctique\\", Cartes et figures de la Terre, Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou, 1980, pp.136-49.

National Australia Bank, 561 U.S. 247 (2010), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the extraterritorial effect of U.S. securities legislation. Morrison extinguished two species of securities class-action claims that had proliferated in preceding years: \\"foreign-cubed\\" claims, in which foreign plaintiffs sued foreign issuers for losses on transactions on foreign exchanges, and \\"foreign-squared\\" claims, brought by domestic plaintiffs against foreign issuers for losses on transactions on foreign exchanges.  Background  The case concerned the 1998 purchase by National Australia Bank of a mortgage servicing company, HomeSide Lending, headquartered in Florida. In July 2001, NAB announced a USD 450 million write- down in assets due to losses associated with HomeSide Lending; and a further USD 1.75 billion write-down in September of that year. The root cause of the write-down, was that the modelling done by HomeSide Lending to determine future revenues from mortgage fees was based on overly optimistic assumptions. The plaintiffs claimed that this was part of an intentional scheme to defraud committed by HomeSide's management. By the time the case reached the US Supreme Court, only Australian investors remained as plaintiffs, although a US investor (Morrison, for whom the case was named) participated in earlier proceedings, but his case was thrown out for unrelated reasons. The plaintiffs argued that the fact the alleged fraud occurred in Florida meant that it should be subject to US securities laws. The defendants argued that, since the alleged fraud related to trading in Australian securities, US securities laws did not apply.  Opinion of the Court  The decision was unanimous in favour of the defendants (albeit with Justice Sotomayor recusing herself, given that she had been involved in the case at the Second Circuit). However, different reasons were given. The majority opinion, by Scalia, held that since the plain language of section 10(b) only applies to US securities, it should not be read to apply to non-US securities, despite long-standing precedent, originating in the 2nd Circuit, and since adopted by other circuits also, that 10(b) also applies to non-US securities. The Court clarified a \\"longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\\" It noted that ‚Äúthe Second Circuit believed the Exchange Act‚Äôs silence about ¬ß10(b)‚Äôs extraterritorial application permitted the court to ‚Äòdiscern‚Äô whether Congress would have wanted the statute to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritoriality has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application. The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.‚ÄùMorrison v. National Australia Bank syllabus 2 Stevens filed a partial concurrence, which Ginsburg joined, rejecting the overturning of the existing jurisprudence on section 10(b); at the same time, he held that in this particular case, the defendants should prevail, since both the plaintiffs and defendants were Australian, and the case would be better dealt with by the Australian court system ‚Äì but unlike the majority, he would apply 10(b) to cases involving non-US securities, where there was a closer connection to the US (e.g. US plaintiffs).  Aftermath  The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of July 21, 2010, in its section 929P(b), allowed the SEC and DOJ extraterritorial jurisdiction, but this interpretation remains contested in the courts. In its section 929Y, the Act commissioned the SEC to study extending the permission to private actors. The study indicated a number of options for action to be taken by Congress, which in varying degrees would mitigate the decision. In late 2010, Fabrice Tourre of Goldman Sachs asked for dismissal of an SEC suit against him based on the repercussions of the decision in this case, claiming his deals were outside the US and thus not subject to certain US laws.

It is generally used to note the presence of an illness where the symptoms presented were sufficient to make a general diagnosis, but where a specific diagnosis was not made. The DSM-IV, for example, \\"applies the term not otherwise specified (NOS) to a disorder or disturbance that does not meet the criteria for the specific disorders already discussed\\".Patricia G. O'Brien, Winifred Z. Kennedy, M.S.N., R.N., Karen A Ballard, M.A., R.N., Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing (2012), p. 501. The term was introduced because \\"it is sometimes impossible for the practitioner completing the diagnostic assessment to categorize all the symptoms that a client is experiencing into one diagnostic category\\".Sophia F. Dziegielewski, DSM-IV-TR in Action (2013), p. 50-51. In the context of mental health diagnoses, four situations have been outlined for which such a diagnosis may be considered appropriate: It is noted, however, that the use of an NOS classification invites scrutiny when billing or seeking reimbursement for practitioners.  Examples  This classification is commonly used in psychiatric diagnoses, such as in: * DD-NOS, depressive disorder * ED-NOS, eating disorder * MD-NOS, mood disorder * PD-NOS, personality disorder * PDD-NOS, pervasive developmental disorder * Psychotic disorder not otherwise specified It is also used in the conditions: * PTCL- NOS, peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified * Adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified The ICD-10 also uses this phrase for various things, such as: * Fall from, out of or through building, not otherwise specified (W13.9) The phrase is also used within the List of UN numbers, where it refers to a generic entry, e.g. \\"UN 1993: Flammable liquid, N.O.S.\\".

Built in 1915, it is a good example of Classical Revival architecture, with a distinctive plan predating the Postal Service's standardization of buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It was included in the Greenwich Municipal Center Historic District which was listed in 1988, and is also included in the Greenwich Avenue Historic District. The building is now in commercial retail use. Description and history Greenwich's former post office occupies a prominent triangular site between Greenwich Avenue and Arch Street, with a small public park housing a war memorial in front of it. The building is a single-story masonry structure, with a steel frame finished in brick and stone. The main facade faces the intersection, consisting of a curved wall with a recessed entry area. The recess is supported by six Corinthian columns, and is topped by a parapet with balustraded elements. The building, completed in 1915, appears to be one of the last of an era of post office design where government buildings were individually designed and were \\"intended as monuments to bring Federal ideas and sophisticated architecture to small communities.\\" Other post offices, later, were standardized. and The building was acquired by the company Renovation Hardware and extensively altered in 2014. The exterior post office facade remains the same. However, the interior is completely renovated to accommodate a two-story, high-value merchandise store. Moreover, Restoration Hardware expanded the rear of the building to make larger gallery space and patio space for customers.

In 1856 he painted Prince Fakhr-ud Din Mirza, the eldest son of Bahadur Shah II, the last King of Delhi, five months before the Prince died. Biography =Early life= William Carpenter was born in about 1818. He was the eldest son of William Hookham Carpenter and his wife, Margaret Carpenter (born Geddes). His father was a keeper at the British Museum and his mother was a noted portrait artist. William entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1835.Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists, Pauline Rohatg et al, 2008, V&A;, accessed July 2010 He initially painted with oils but quickly took to water colour. =India= William followed his brother abroad in the early 1850s and painted in India for some years. Carpenter kept no diary, however his large collection of dated watercolour paintings allows his journey to be recreated. He travelled overland through Egypt and arrived in Bombay in June 1850. Almost immediately he travelled to Poona where others were escaping the heat in the mountains. By the time he returned to Bombay in about December he had painted a school in the old Maratha Palace and views of the Shaniwar Palace. He saw the new year in whilst visiting Salsette Island, after he had spent Christmas Day painting Mount Mary's Basilica at Bandra. His paintings included a view of the Mahim Causeway which had recently been built to join Salsette island to the mainland. Carpenter's painting of Tara Chand in June or July 1851 Prince Fakhr-ud Din Mirza In 1851, Carpenter met Tara Chand, the court painter to Maharana Sarup Singh of Udaipur and recorded that meeting with a painting of the Indian artist and his two sons. The painting shows Chand drawing ‚Äì so he may have been drawing Carpenter at the same time.Portrait of Tara Chand, the Court Painter, Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed July 2010 Carpenter painted landscapes and portraits of local rulers.

He and Carpenter missed the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when his brothers were killed. England After his return Carpenter was able to sell his paintings as the basis of stories to the Illustrated London News. Carpenter later travelled to Boston, Massachusetts and was there in 1866, but it is not known how long he spent in America. Carpenter had a one- man exhibition in South Kensington Museum in 1881 which included 275 paintings.

The term must not to be confused with the \\"PolySoup\\" operation available in the 3D package Houdini, whose goal is to optimize the storage space needed by some piece of geometry through the reduction of the underlying number of polygon soups used in its representation. This is accomplished by removing redundant data points (e.g. vertices with the same position) without altering the topology or assigned properties of the optimized geometry in relation to the input one. As a result of this optimization, there can be savings in the storage and processing of large polygon meshes. These savings can have a bigger impact the larger the input data is. For instance, fluid simulations, particle simulations, rigid-body simulations, environments, and character models can reach into the millions of polygons for feature films, incurring in large storage and read/write costs. In those cases, reducing the number of polygon soups required to represent such data can lead to important savings in storage use and compute time.

Geography and history The village of Smardale lies in hilly agricultural land at a height of around southeast of Crosby Garrett and west of Kirkby Stephen. To the south is Smardale fell whilst a boundary is formed to the west by Scandal Beck which flows from Smardalegill, a narrow valley to the southwest. The name Smaredale may derive from smere, an ancient name for clover, or from the old Norse or old English for butter/fat/grease giving either valley of butter or valley of clover. Chapel well, a Holy well, is found west of Scandal Beck where it once stood within Smardale church. There are also other signs of ancient human activity: the archaeological remains of settlements are found on Smardale fell, and around Smardalegill, pillow mounds, known locally as 'Giant's graves' which are thought by some to be for drying bracken, and not for rabbits. Oxenbrow wood, to the north of Smardale village is the site of a Heronry. =Smardale Hall= There has been a substantial dwelling in Smardale since at least the 14th century; a tower house, a remnant of which, a newel, now forms part of the structure of the south eastern part of the current house. The current buildings date from 15th and 16th centuries; being originally built on a courtyard plan with the tower incorporated into an east wing, now demolished. The southern part of the hall (now farm buildings) was the original great hall. Sir George Dalston, the castles occupant from 1761 made considerable alterations to the structure. The west wing, which is the current hall is unusual in having four conically roofed round towers at the corners of the structure, giving the structure an appearance similar to the Scottish baronial style of architecture. The hall and associated buildings are Grade II* listed structures (since 1968). There is evidence for an earlier fortified structure from a motte and ditch discovered north of the hall. =Smardale Gill= Smardalegill is a small steep-sided valley connecting Smardale and the valley of the River Eden with the eastern end of the valley of the River Lune. Scandal Beck runs north- northeast through it, as does the former Stainmore Railway. Smardale Gill quarry was a large limestone quarry on the west side of Smardale Gill. Lime was produced on site at two limekilns with raw materials brought to the top of the kilns using an inclined plane and a stationary engine. A railway siding on the Stainmore line next to the kilns allowed lime to be carried away by rail. The limekilns and evidence of the engine house and inclined plane are extant. Smardale Gill nature reserve is a national nature reserve (NNR) and Site of Special Scientific Interest managed by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust. Land in Smardale Gill was first acquired in 1978. Later in 1991 the reserve acquired the trackbed of the former Stainmore railway from Smardale to Brownber from British Rail The site contains both woodland and grassland habitats and is a good example of a limestone habitat. At the south end of the valley on the border with Ravenstonedale civil parish is the 18th-century arched stone packhorse bridge known as Smardale bridge, now a Grade II listed structure. There is a small disused sandstone quarry at the south of the gill. =Railways= Two railway lines ran through Smardale and past the village. The Stainmore Railway passed Smardale on the northern edge of the village, where there was a small halt, Smardale railway station (now a private dwelling). Going westwards it then crossed under the Settle to Carlisle railway line just east of Scandal Beck before curving south through Smardalegill along the east bank. Within Smardalegill the line crosses the beck at a shallow angle by Smardalegill Viaduct. The Settle to Carlisle railway line passes Smardale village to the south, travelling east-west; to the west the line crosses Scandal Beck by Smardale Viaduct. Smardale Gill Viaduct from the southwest Smardale Gill Viaduct's restored upper deck for use by walkers Smardale Gill Viaduct predates Smardale Viaduct, being complete in 1861. The viaduct was designed by Sir Thomas Bouch for the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway and the construction contracted to Mr Wrigg, costing ¬£11,928 to build. The bridge, which was built of local stone has 14 arches, and is high and long. The line across it remained single tracked despite the structure being wide enough for a double line. After the line closed in 1962 the viaduct fell into disrepair, by the 1980s the structure had become dangerous and was to be demolished. Instead the viaduct became a listed building, and British Rail offered ¬£230,000 (the estimated cost of demolition) towards its restoration. A charitable trust, the Northern Viaduct Trust was formed in 1989. The cost of repairs was ¬£350,000 which included masonry repair, a new deck and waterproofing, and structural work to the viaduct. In 1992 the restoration was complete, the viaduct being subsequently used for pedestrian access to Smardale Gill nature reserve. In 2010 after a harsh winter it was found that the viaduct had frost damage and required a further ¬£30,000 of repairs. Smardale Viaduct Smardale Viaduct was built by the contractors Benton & Woodiwiss for the Settle to Carlisle Line of the Midland Railway. The viaduct is long and high, the highest on the line. Over of stone was used in its construction. Local limestone was used for its construction, the arch quoins were of millstone grit. Two of the twelve piers ‚Äì the fourth and the tenth are of considerably heavier construction. The bridge opened in August 1875 having taken five years to construct, it crosses both Scandal Beck and the former Stainmore railway line.

These seamounts are at their largest in diameter and in height. Studies of the seamount include dives by the submersible dives (DSV Shinkai, 1993 and 1997), drilling (Ocean Drilling Program, 2001) and (International Ocean Discovery Program, 2016-2017), and ROV dives (2003, 2009). The seamount and its nearby peers were created by the movement of crushed rock, resulting from plate movement, upwards through fissures in the Mariana Plate. South Chamorro is the farthest of the mud volcanoes from the trench, at a distance of , resulting in high-temperature flows rich in sulfate and methane. The seamount suffered a major flank collapse on its southeastern side, over which the present summit was probably formed. The summit supports an ecosystem of mussels, gastropods, tube worms, and others, suggesting that it is an active seeping region.  Geology  = Origin and geochemistry = South Chamorro Seamount and the other mud volcanoes formed as a result of the subduction of the Pacific Plate below the Mariana Plate; fault lines in the Mariana Plate provide a gateway for churned up rock and fluid from the grinding process up to the ocean surface. Reactions with the overlying mantle produce serpentinite, hydrogen gas, and other alkaline substances. South Chamorro Seamount was first recognized as a mud volcano in 1977, on the basis of sonar data, and confirmed as such in 1981 by the collection of serpentine and schist. is one of the farthest volcanoes from the trench, away, where the plate rides approximately underneath. Because of its distance from the trench, its eruptive fluids are hotter (over ), less alkalic, and with more calcium. Its flows have a pH of 12.2 (highly basic) and are sulfate and methane rich. Serpentine mud volcanoes are currently limited to the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc; however, there is evidence of the geological remnants of similar volcanics globally, throughout Earth's history. = Structure = Side-scan surveys of South Chamorro Seamount show a major southeastern sector edifice collapse, with debris flows of serpentine material (dredged in 1981 and observed by submersibles in 1995) that blankets the slope of the trench from summit to axis. The true summit of the volcano sits above this collapse; its formation was likely tied to the collapse. Submarine observation of the summit show that the summit knoll is broken up into slabs of serpentine mud, with meter-deep fissures arranged in a crosscutting orientation.  Ecology  South Chamorro Seamount is host to a variety of fauna, including mussels, gastropods, tube worms, and galatheid crabs. A borehole observatory on the summit produced 20,000 litres of microbially-altered fluid per day for study. These organisms are supported by low-temperature springs from the fissures surrounding the summit zone. The mussels are probably of the genus Bathymodiolus, which require a high concentration of methane in their food source. The fluid composition and the biological community suggests that the summit region is an active cold seep region.

As a result, in 1686 the Spanish governor ordered Captain Juan Fern√°ndez de la Fuente to send troops to Janos to establish a presidio.

This settlement offer was also open to Apache, but few took advantage of it. Over the next several years, the Spanish made a number of punitive raids against local Apache groups, both from the Janos Presidio and others in the area.

This reptile lived before the arrival of humans and is believed to have grown to at least long.Barahona et al., 2000, p. 381 It was described by the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Fossils of this lizard have been found in volcanic caves, where they often appear with those of other animals, like the Tenerife giant rat.  Classification  Prehistoric Gallotia remains have been assigned to the taxa G. maxima and G. goliath, the former supposedly occurring only on Tenerife, the latter on several islands. It was eventually determined, however, that G. maxima is a junior synonym of G. goliath, and that the latter was close to the El Hierro giant lizard (Gallotia simonyi); supposed goliath specimens from El Hierro, La Gomera, and La Palma (from the Cuevas de los Murci√©lagos) are probably just extremely large individuals of, respectively, the El Hierro, La Gomera (Gallotia bravoana) and La Palma (Gallotia auaritae) giant lizards.Barahona et al., 2000 Based on DNA sequence analysis of mummified remains, G. goliath is a valid species that probably was restricted to Tenerife, and apparently was closer to the Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia) than to the El Hierro giant lizard.Maca-Meyer et al., 2003  Characteristics  G. goliath was the largest reptile in the Canary Islands, reaching a length of 120 to 125 cm, but based on the finding of a 13.5 cm skull in 1952, there could have been even larger specimens.

Taxodone and taxodione exhibit anticancer, antibacterial, antioxidant, antifungal, insecticide, and antifeedant activities. Discovery Taxodone was first isolated in 1968 from the seeds of Taxodium distichum (Bald Cypress) by S. Morris Kupchan and coworkers. They reported the structure determination and basic chemistry of taxodone and its oxidized rearrangement product, taxodione. Taxodone occurs naturally in the form of (+)-taxodone. Occurrence Taxodone and/or taxodione have been identified in several plants besides Taxodium distichum including: Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary), Salvia barrelieri, Metasequoia glyptostroboides (Dawn Redwood), Salvia munzii (San Diego Sage), Salvia moorcroftiana, Salvia staminea, Salvia clevelandii (Cleveland Sage), Salvia hypargeia, Salvia broussonetii, Salvia montbretii, Salvia nipponica, Salvia verbenaca (Wild Clary), Salvia lanigera,Salvia prionitis, Salvia deserta, Salvia phlomoides, and Plectranthus hereroensis Taxodone, taxodione and their reaction products have been used as archeological and geological biomarkers. Analogs of taxodone and taxodione have also been isolated. 2-hydroxy taxodone and 2-hydroxy-taxodione have been found in Salvia texana (Texas Sage). 5,6-Didehydro-7-hydroxy-taxodone was found in Salvia munzii. 7-Hydroxytaxodione, 7,7‚Äò-bistaxodione, and 11,11‚Äò-didehydroxy-7,7‚Äò-dihydroxytaxodione were found in Salvia montbretti. Activity Taxodone and taxodione possess in vivo activity against Walker intramuscular carcinosarcoma 256 in rats (25 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) and in vitro activity against cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx (KB) (ED50 = 0.6 and 3 ug/ml respectively). Taxodone and taxodione exhibit antifungal activity against wood decay fungi, with taxodione being especially active against Trametes versicolor and Fomitopsis palustris. Taxodione exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among the tested diterpenoids from the roots of Salvia barrelieri. Taxodone showed potent antibacterial effects against foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19166, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2515, Salmonella enteritidis KCTC 2021, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Staphylococcus aureus.KCTC 1916 Taxodone showed potent termicidal activity against the subterranean termite, Reticulitermes speratus Kolbe. Taxodione depresses neruonal GABAA receptor-operated Cl-current (IGABA). Taxodione may have potential in treatment of cardiovascular disease. The use of taxodone and taxodione to inhibit hair growth has been patented.US Patent 5824665US Patent 6218435US Patent 20070203240 Treatment of benign prostate enlargement with taxodone has also been patented.World Patent 2004064736 Chemistry Taxodone was the first isolated example of a quinone methide with a labile hydrogen adjacent to this reactive chromophore. Kupchan demonstrated that taxodone aromatizes to a catechol ketone upon exposure to mild acid. Air oxidation of this catechol ketone affords taxodione. 400px Synthesis Taxodone rearranges easily in the presence of mild acids and reacts readily with nucleophiles. Although taxodone shows higher anticancer and antibacterial activity than taxodione it eluded creation in the laboratory for over 25 years because of its inherent instability. During this time several different groups reported syntheses of the more stable taxodione. In 1993 taxodone was synthesized for the first time in a 16 step sequence utilizing a unique phenol benzylic epoxide electron reorganization in the final step. As taxodone readily decomposes into taxodione this synthesis of taxodone also constitutes a formal synthesis of taxodione as well. 400px Since the synthesis of taxodone there have been additional syntheses of taxodione and analogs.

He had also served as Acting Chancellor in 1970 while the New York City Board of Education was searching for a permanent replacement. Early life and education He was born on October 27, 1911, in Red Hook, Brooklyn, his parents were Jewish immigrants who had received little formal education. A product of the New York City public schools, Anker attended City College of New York, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees. He started teaching in 1934 at Erasmus Hall High School and worked his way up through the school system, becoming chairman of social studies at Long Island City High School, and then principal of Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem.Goodnough, Abby. \\"Irving Anker Dies at 88; Led Schools in Time of Turmoil\\", The New York Times, June 14, 2000.

Littwin.Staff. \\"SEVEN HIGH SCHOOLS GET NEW PRINCIPALS\\", The New York Times, August 21, 1966. Accessed July 28, 2010. Deputy and Acting Chancellor While searching for a permanent Superintendent of Schools in 1970 for Nathan Brown, the Board of Education named Anker to serve as Acting Superintendent until the position was filled. The Board had approached, and been turned down by, such notables as Ralph Bunche, Ramsey Clark, Arthur J. Goldberg and Sargent Shriver, before choosing Harvey B. Scribner, who had been Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Education and superintendent of the Teaneck Public Schools, where he oversaw the implementation of a voluntary school integration program.Buder, Leonard. \\"School Board Weighs 6 for Chancellor\\", The New York Times, June 19, 1970; accessed July 28, 2010. Described as an \\"answer man to any question anybody's got about the city's school system\\", Anker didn't know that his salary as Acting Superintendent of Schools would be $48,000, and increase of almost $14,000 from his previous post as assistant superintendent. Anker's title was renamed to Chancellor as of July 1, 1970, the same day that the 32 local school boards were to take office. Anker expressed concern that \\"decentralization is going to be a time-consuming and touchy job\\" and expressed fears that it could lead to all-white and all-black schools.Moran, Nancy. \\"An Unfazed Educator; Irving Anker\\", The New York Times, February 27, 1970; accessed July 28, 2010. After being selected as Chancellor and as desired by the board of education, Scribner chose Anker to fill the newly created position of deputy chancellor at an annual salary of $48,000, to give Scribner a senior aide and second-in-command with experience in the New York City system.Buder, Leonard. \\"Scribner, Vermont Official, to Head City Schools\\", The New York Times, July 17, 1970; accessed July 28, 2010. Scribner's post in Vermont did not expire until September 1, 1970, and Anker remained as Acting Chancellor until that date.Staff. \\"Article 4 -- No Title\\", The New York Times, July 23, 1970; accessed July 28, 2010. Citing what he called a \\"confidence gap\\" with the Board of Education, Scribner announced in December 1972 that he would leave his post as Chancellor when his three-year contract ended on June 30, 1973.Buder, Leonard. \\"SCRIBNER TO QUIT; SAYS THAT BOARD DOESN'T WANT HIM; He Sees a 'Confidence Gap' in Failure to Renew His School Contract Fast DECISION IS A SURPRISE Monserrat Says Education Panel Planned to Act Next Month on Chancellor Scribner Resigns, Blaming City Board\\", The New York Times, December 22, 1972; accessed July 28, 2010. Before going on a vacation (that would prove permanent) starting on April 1, 1973, Chancellor Scribner named Anker to serve as Acting Chancellor until Scribner's contract expired on June 30. While the New York City Board of Education had not decided on a replacement, Anker was seen as the most likely person to fill the spot on a permanent basis if the board's choice was an \\"insider\\".Buder, Leonard. \\"Scribner Names Aide As Interim Chancellor; 1969 Law Cited Board Gets Memorandum\\", The New York Times, March 16, 1973; accessed July 28, 2010. Chancellor As had been widely expected, Anker was named as School Chancellor in June 1973, with Samuel Polatnick as executive director of the Office of High Schools, Dr. Edythe J. Gaines atop the Office of Educational Planning and Support and Alfredo Mathew, Jr., as chief of the Office of School District Affairs.Buder, Leonard. \\"Anker, as Expected, Is Named City School Chancellor\\", The New York Times, June 15, 1973; accessed July 28, 2010. As School Chancellor, Anker oversaw the decentralization program that began in 1969 in which staffing choices in elementary and middle schools were made by a network of 32 community school boards. Often viewed as a steppingstone to political office or as an opportunity for patronage, Anker was often at odds with the local boards, ultimately investigating charges of corruption or mismanagement in seven of the 32 local boards and using his powers to suspend board members or to override their actions. In one of his first confrontations, after dismissing the school board of District 9 in the Bronx and replacing it with a trustee he appointed, Anker faced a sit-in by parents who viewed Anker's actions as a racially motivated effort to undermine local control. In December 1974, Anker submitted a proposed $2.78 billion budget for the 1975-76 school year that would add more than $500 million in spending over the previous budget, which would be used to expand services for handicapped and non-English-speaking students. Anker resisted efforts by Mayor of New York Abe Beame to cut services during the depths of New York City's fiscal crisis, saying that he was only requesting \\"enough money to make the schools as good as possible - not nearly enough to make them as good as they ought to be\\". In a time of belt tightening citywide, Anker said that \\"we cannot write off the children of New York City without calling into question every value we live by\\".Buder, Leonard. \\"CITY SCHOOLS ASK FOR $2,78-BILLION, A RECORD BUDGET; More Help for Handicapped and Non-English-Speaking Pupils Is Suggested IMPROVEMENTS SOUGHT Anker Notes Fiscal Crisis, but He Asserts Children Are Not Expendable City Schools Ask a Record Budget of $2.78 Billion\\", 'The New York Times, December 30, 1974; accessed July 28, 2010. City budget officials forced Anker to make $230 million in cuts, including the termination of 21,000 positions in the system, increasing class sizes and reducing much of the art, music and after-school programs that had previously been offered. The increased burdens on the remaining teachers led to a five-day strike in September 1975 by the United Federation of Teachers, which ended when Anker agreed with UFT head Albert Shanker to cut 90 minutes from the school day. In an effort to more thoroughly integrate the city's high schools, Anker had the attendance zones of high schools in Brooklyn modified to achieve a greater balance between white students and the increasing numbers of African American and Hispanic students, which resulted in further white flight from the city and its schools. The Board of Education was charged in 1977 by the federal government, which claimed that the city's schools discriminated in the hiring of African American and Hispanic teachers and had improperly concentrated minority teachers in majority minority schools. Anker implemented changes to expand hiring of minority teachers and to achieve a more even distribution of staffing around the school system. After taking office in January 1978 as Mayor of New York, Ed Koch forced out Anker as Chancellor in favor of Frank Macchiarola, a key Koch advisor who had been a vice president of the CUNY Graduate Center and deputy director of the New York State Emergency Financial Control Board for New York City; Anker would serve until his contract ended on June 30, 1978.Chambers, Marcia. \\"Macchiarola, Koch Choice, Named Chancellor by Board of Education; City U.

Personal After departing the city schools, Anker became an educational consultant, in addition to teaching at a Florida community college and at the Graduate School of Education of Long Island University. A resident of Jamaica, Queens, Anker died at his home there at age 88 on June 12, 2000, of natural causes. He was survived by his wife, three daughters, a son and seven grandchildren.

Bestuzhev was born into one of Russia's oldest families; Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin was his uncle. He started out as a journalist, helping Andrey Krayevsky to edit the literary journal Otechestvennye Zapiski where he published numerous reviews of historical and ethnographic works.

Auto Racing pits two players against each other (or a single player against the clock) using a top- down perspective on one of five different race courses. Auto Racing was released under the same name by Sears for its private-label version of the Intellivision console, the \\"Super Video Arcade.\\" Gameplay In Auto Racing, players begin by selecting one of the five numbered courses, with the higher numbers representing increased difficulty. Players can also allow the computer to randomly choose from the first four courses. Next, players select from one of five Formula One racing vehicles, each with a different set of capabilities. Players cannot select the same cars, however two of the cars are identical in specifications, allowing for two-player matches for drivers of equal skills. The cars will accelerate to their top speeds automatically, with the player in control of steering and braking. The courses are shown from a top-down perspective, and there are no computer-controlled cars on the track. Each course has a number of invisible checkpoints. During the race, if a player crashes into an obstacle along the course, or if one player's lead over their opponent pushes the opponent off the screen, the cars will be reset at the last checkpoint passed. In a single-player game, the player must complete five laps of the course as quickly as possible. In a two-player game, players score two points whenever their opponent crashes, or one point when they take a significant lead over their opponent; the game ends when one player scores 50 points. Development In its initial release, Auto Racing used a \\"directional\\" steering mechanic, where players pressed the disc to steer the car towards a screen direction. For example, to steer the car south on the playfield, the bottom of the disc is pressed. The amount of steering depends on where the 16 position disc is pressed. After receiving a number of complaints, Mattel revised the game with a \\"realistic\\" steering mechanic, where to make left turns the left side of the disc is pressed, and for right turns the right side of the disc is pressed. The point on the disc for hard turns stays consistent regardless of the car's orientation. No reference was made on the game's packaging to indicate which steering mechanic that particular cartridge used, with the instructions inside the package indicating the version to be used. The programmer did include the preferred \\"realistic\\" steering in the original release as a hidden option. The hidden feature is enabled by holding 1+6+9 on the controller keypad during system start/reset. The option is per controller. The revised cartridge does not have any hidden option. Reception In Video magazine's\\"Arcade Alley\\" column, Auto Race was described as employing a \\"boldly innovative approach\\" and as \\"undeniably the best video game any manufacturer has produced about this subject so far\\". Reviewers emphasized the game's graphics which were compared favorably to those of Armor Battle, and praise was given to the realistic gameplay feel afforded by the game's use of a zoomed-in scrolling section of racetrack rather than a birds-eye view of the entire track. While describing this \\"unusual presentation of the playfield\\" as one of the game's best features, reviewers also noted that an unfortunate side effect is that if two players in a player-versus-player game become too distantly separated the game must compensate by cutting the race short and awarding a victory to the leading car. Auto Race was awarded \\"Best Sports Game\\" at the 3rd annual Arkie Awards where it was described as an example of \\"true blood-and-thunder racing\\", and as \\"the racing game even those who hate motor sports ought to love\\". Legacy Auto Racing was later included in the Intellivision Lives! compilation.

His wife ate several of the candies, and became violently ill. Investigation determined that the chocolates had been sent by John Buettner-Janusch, the former chairman of the New York University (NYU) Anthropology Department, who had been sentenced to prison by Brieant after being convicted of making illegal drugs. Buettner-Janusch was convicted of attempted murder. Anecdotes Brieant was known as \\"Charlie\\" by his close friends and colleagues.

For many years, Brieant displayed in his judicial chambers a painted portrait of Judge Martin Manton, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit who was convicted and imprisoned for accepting bribes from litigants. When asked why he had rescued the portrait of the disgraced Manton from obscurity and given it a prominent place in his chambers, Brieant would tell visitors that the painting was a reminder of the fallibility of judges.Benjamin Weiser, \\"Can He Hang?

Early life The fourth son of Edward Scott of Plymouth, Devon, and was born there on 2 January 1822. He was educated privately at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Military career Scott obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 18 December 1840. After going through the usual course of professional instruction at Chatham he was stationed at Woolwich and Plymouth in succession. Promoted to be first lieutenant on 19 December 1843, he went to Gibraltar in January 1844, where he was acting adjutant of his corps. While at Gibraltar he accompanied Arthur Penrhyn Stanley and his two sisters on a tour in Spain. In 1848 he returned to England, and was appointed assistant instructor in field works at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was promoted to be second captain on 11 November 1851, in which year he married. He was in the same year appointed senior instructor in field works at the Royal Military Academy. On 1 April 1855 Scott was promoted to be first captain, and was appointed instructor in surveying at the Royal Engineer establishment at Brompton, Chatham, where he was the close adviser of the commandant, Colonel Henry Drury Harness, in the reorganisation of this army school. At Chatham he had charge of the chemical laboratory, and his experiments enabled him to perfect the selenitic lime which goes by his name. His system of representing ground by horizontal hachures and a scale of shade was perfected at Chatham, and adopted for the army as the basis of military sketching. During his residence at Brompton, Kent, a drought occurred, and he assisted in establishing a waterworks in the Luton valley. On 19 May 1863 Scott was promoted to be brevet major, and on 5 December of the same year to be regimental lieutenant-colonel. Commission of the Great Exhibition On 14 December 1865 he was seconded in his corps, and employed under the commission of the Great Exhibition of 1851 at South Kensington, in the place of Captain Francis Fowke. He gained the confidence of the commissioners, and on the retirement of Sir Henry Cole was appointed secretary to the commission. The major work by which Scott is remembered was the construction of the Royal Albert Hall at Kensington, with the design and execution of which he was entrusted in 1866. The design of the roof was unique, and there were many predictions that it would fail. Scott, however, never hesitated. When the time arrived, in 1870, for removing the scaffolding which supported the roof, Scott sent every one out of the building, and himself knocked away the final support. The acoustics were a problem. At first there was a decided echo with wind instruments, but the introduction of a \\"velarium\\" below the true roof cured the defect. On 20 May 1871 Scott was made a Companion of the Bath (civil division). On 7 June 1871 Scott was promoted to be brevet colonel, and on 19 August of the same year he retired from the army as an honorary major-general, but continued in his civil appointment at South Kensington. On 3 February 1874 he became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers; on 3 June 1875 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the same year a member of a select Russian scientific society, on which occasion the tsar presented him with a snuff-box set with diamonds. Scott was for some years examiner in military topography under the military education department. He was awarded medals for service rendered to the Great Exhibition of London in 1862, the Prussian Exhibition of 1865, the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867, the annual London International Exhibition of fine arts, industries, and inventions, the Dutch Exhibition of 1877, and the Paris International Exhibition of 1878. He received in 1880 a silver medal from the Society of Arts for a paper entitled ‚ÄòSuggestions for dealing with the Sewerage of London,‚Äô and the Telford premium for a paper he contributed in the same year, in conjunction with G. R. Redgrave, to the Institution of Civil Engineers, on the ‚ÄòManufacture and Testing of Portland Cement.‚Äô He had prepared the plans for the completion of the South Kensington Museum, when, in 1882, the treasury, as an economy, abolished his appointment as secretary of the Great Exhibition commissioners. This abrupt termination helped to break down his health. He designed the buildings for the Fisheries Exhibition, but was too ill to attend the opening. He died at his residence, Silverdale, Sydenham, on 16 April 1883, and was buried at Highgate. Works Scott's life was devoted to public service, and he failed to secure for himself any benefit from his inventions. He contributed to the ‚ÄòTransactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects‚Äô (1857 and 1872) and to the ‚ÄòProfessional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers‚Äô (new ser. vols. vi, vii, x, xi, xii, xvii, xx) papers chiefly dealing with his discovery of his new cement and the construction of the Albert Hall. The Wine Society Scott is also credited with the foundation of the International Exhibition Co-operative Wine Society Limited, which is more commonly referred to simply as The Wine Society. The Wine Society was established in 1874 initially to sell excess wine stocks unsold during the Great Exhibition, and subsequently on the basis of Scott's proposal to set up \\"a co-operative company\\" to buy good quality wines on a regular basis to sell to members. He served as The Wine Society's first Treasurer until his death in 1883.

It has its headquarters in the Broadway State Office Building in Jefferson City. The department operates the state's social services. Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan established the Family Investment Trust (FIT) in November 1993, which was changed to Family and Community Trust (FACT) by Governor Bob Holden in April 2001. FACT, which is housed within the Missouri Department of Social Services, is designed to lead a collaborative effort to improve the conditions of Missouri's families and communities. It is also to encourage a collaborative effort among both private and public community entities to build local support systems. The Department of Social Services partners with families and communities to protect children, rehabilitate youth and move families to self sufficiency so that Missourians can lead safe, healthy and productive lives. Administrative responsibility for agency activities rests with a department director appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the state Senate. Agency programs are managed through its functional divisions. The department maintains field offices in each Missouri county and in the City of St. Louis. Twenty-one Caring Community organizations were established around Missouri to implement this approach with six core results: parents working, children safe, children ready for school, children and families health, children and youth succeeding in school, and youth ready to enter the work force. FACT is the nonprofit corporation that governs the 21 partnerships. Funding to support this work comes from the state legislature through the Department of Social Services and is a combination of general revenue and a federal match. There are currently 20 community partnerships across Missouri, including Area Resources for Community and Human Services (ARCHS) in St. Louis, Local Investment Commission (LINC) in Kansas City, and more. Program Divisions * Family Support Division (FSD) The Family Support Division (FSD) exists to provide a continuum of support for families. FSD's goal is to assist families in maintaining or improving their quality of life. FSD accomplishes this goal for the children and families of Missouri by providing the best possible services to the public. FSD services include: Income Maintenance programs, including the Food Stamp, Temporary Assistance and Medicaid programs; Rehabilitation Services for the Blind; and the Child Support program. Other programs include: Community Services Block Grant Programs; Low Income Home Energy Assistance; Refugee Resettlement; and Supplemental Nursing Care. * Child Support (CS): The Family Support Division (FSD) helps families by providing the following services: Establish Paternity ‚Äî FSD can help establish paternity (legal fatherhood) for children born to unmarried parents. If the parents are certain ‚Äúdad‚Äù is the child's father, all the parents need to do is sign an Affidavit Acknowledging Paternity. If the paternity of the child is uncertain, FSD can arrange for a paternity test. If the test shows the man to be the child's father, FSD or the court may enter an order establishing paternity. Establish Support Orders ‚Äî FSD establishes child and medical support orders when a support order does not exist. When determining the amount of the child support payment, FSD staff use the child support guidelines established by the Missouri Supreme Court. The guidelines consider the income of both parents. The Missouri Child Support Amount Calculation Worksheet (Form 14) is used to calculate the child support amount. Review Support Orders - FSD also reviews existing child and medical support orders to determine if the orders should be changed. On a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or MO HealthNet case, Child Support either performs a review on its own or at either parent's request. On non-TANF cases, Child Support conducts reviews if requested. Enforce Support Orders ‚Äî FSD helps families receive their child, medical and spousal support by: ‚óæWithholding income (wages, Workers‚Äô Compensation benefits, unemployment compensation benefits, etc.); ‚óæIntercepting federal and state income tax refunds; ‚óæOrdering employers to enroll noncustodial parents‚Äô children in health care plans; ‚óæReporting noncustodial parents who owe past‚Äìdue support to credit bureaus; ‚óæFiling liens on personal and/or real property; ‚óæIntercepting lottery winnings; ‚óæSuspending licenses (drivers, recreational, professional); ‚óæAsking the prosecuting attorney to file civil contempt or criminal non‚Äìsupport charges upon request by the applicant for services; and ‚óæWorking with other states to collect support when noncustodial parents live outside Missouri. Who is eligible for child support services? The Missouri Family Support Division (FSD) is a state agency that provides child support services to: ‚óæCustodial parents - parents who live with the children. ‚óæNoncustodial parents - parents who do not live with the children. ‚óæCustodians - relatives or non-relatives if the non-relative has legal custody or guardianship. ‚óæAdult children - persons between the ages 18‚Äì21. ‚óæAlleged fathers - men whose fatherhood is in question. ‚óæThe legal representative of the custodial parent's/custodian's estate when that person is deceased * Children's Division (CD): The Children's Division (CD) works in partnership with families, communities, the courts and other governmental entities toward assuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of Missouri's children. The Division's guiding principles are Protection, Partnership, Permanency, Practice Excellence, Prevention and Professionalism. The division works with all parties to safely maintain children in their homes whenever possible and to secure safe, permanent living arrangements when out-of-home placement is necessary. The Children's Division administers the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline, School Violence Hotline, Intensive In-Home Services, Family Centered Services, Adoption Services, Independent Living, Foster Care, Residential Licensing and preventive services including Early Head Start, Stay-at-Home Parent Program, Child Care Start-Up and Expansion Program, Child Care Subsidy, and other early childhood and early intervention strategies. The division is responsible for the assessment and investigation of all reports to the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline. * MO HealthNet Division (MHD) The MO HealthNet Division (MHD) administers the MO HealthNet (Missouri Medicaid) program. MO HealthNet provides medical services to eligible participants within defined program benefits in somewhat the same way insurance companies provide coverage for their policyholders. The services provided include those required by the federal government such as hospital and physician services. Also included are optional services such as pharmaceutical and personal care services authorized by the Missouri General Assembly and identified in state statute. A mandatory Medicaid managed care program is in place for eligible participants in the eastern, central, and western areas of the state. Children, pregnant women, TANF families, and children in state custody receive their medical care through managed care organizations, allowing the state to ensure access to health care and control costs at the same time. The MO HealthNet Pharmacy Program oversees outpatient prescription drug reimbursement. The pharmacy benefit includes reimbursement for all drug products of manufacturers who have entered into a rebate agree with the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and that are dispensed by qualified providers, with few therapeutic category exclusions. In addition, MHD is responsible for program development, benefit design and clinical policy decision-making with activities oriented towards wellness and continuum of care. The MO HealthNet program includes specialized services for specific populations within the state by receiving waiver authority from the federal government. Home and community-based waivers for the elderly, certain developmentally disabled participants, as well as patients with AIDS were obtained and allow the MO HealthNet program to pay for otherwise non-covered home care as an alternative to more expensive institutional care. These services are restricted to those participants who would otherwise require, and whose home care is no more expensive than, institutionalization. * Missouri Division of Youth Services (DYS) The Division of Youth Services‚Äô (DYS) mission is to protect communities from juvenile offenders in the division's care and custody and to provide appropriate services to youth and their families. This balanced approach to juvenile justice relies on community partnerships for the development and enhancement of services for the prevention of delinquency. DYS programs are established to provide the mandated services enumerated in Chapter 219.016 in the Revised Statutes of the state of Missouri. These services include assessment, care and treatment, and education of all youth committed to its care. DYS is charged with the care and treatment of youth committed to its custody by one of the 45 Missouri juvenile courts. Towards this end, DYS operates treatment programs ranging from non-residential day treatment centers through secure residential institutions. Additionally, DYS administers the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, operates an accredited school program, and maintains a statewide statistical database of juvenile court referrals. DYS is administratively organized into one central office and five regional offices. * Rehabilitation Services for the Blind Director and Support Divisions * Office of the Director * Missouri Medicaid Audit and Compliance * Division of Legal Services * Research and Evaluation Unit References External links * Missouri Department of Social Services *Publications by or about the Missouri Department of Social Services at Internet Archive.

The museum's mission is to preserve \\"the stories of the Kachemak Bay region\\", through \\"collections, exhibits, and programs in culture, science, and art\\". Indoor exhibits include early homesteading, Native Alaskan traditions, local contemporary art, and an exploration of the marine and terrestrial life around Kachemak Bay. Outdoor exhibits feature a historic cabin, botanical gardens and a nature trail.  History  The Pratt Museum had its beginnings in the Homer Society of Natural History, which had incorporated in 1965. Local artist Sam Pratt had a collection of items that led to the founding of the society. Hazel Heath, the treasurer of the society from 1968‚Äì1983 and mayor of Homer from 1968‚Äì1976, has been credited with founding the museum, which was established in 1968. Sam Pratt and his wife Vega donated the land on which the Museum was built, and Sam Pratt served as the first volunteer curator of the Museum. Exhibits The main gallery's exhibit at the Pratt Museum is entitled Kachemak Bay: An Exploration of People & Place, which explores the cultures that have existed in Kachemak Bay, as well as contemporary life in Kachemak Bay. The gallery has exhibits from early Native Alaskans to the homesteaders of the 1930s and 1940s, to the current fisheries that sustain the Kachemak Bay area, including Homer, Kachemak City, Seldovia, Halibut Cove, Anchor Point, and additional villages around the Bay. One major attraction for visitors is a live-feed wildlife camera set up to view seabirds such as puffins, cormorants, and murres on Gull Island in Kachemak Bay. The camera is controlled at the museum, with a touchscreen below the main screen for visitor use. The SeeBird Camera (or Gull Cam) is also available online during the summer months, although it is controlled by the visitors at the museum and not the online visitors.

He was jure uxoris count of Nevers from 1265 and of Auxerre and Tonnerre from 1268. He was also in his own right Count of Valois and Cr√©py, as an apanages of the crown, from 1268.  Birth and childhood  John was born in Damietta, Egypt. He was the sixth child and the fourth son of king Louis IX of France, called St. Louis after canonization, and Margaret of Provence. Moreover, he was the first of three children of this royal couple who were born during the Seventh Crusade. He was born at the Egyptian port town of Damietta which had been conquered by the crusaders in 1249. According to chronicler Jean de Joinville, an old knight acted as midwife during John's birth. Two days prior to his birth, the king was captured by the Mamluks which was the reason to name the child Tristan due to the triste occasion. He was baptised in the grand mosque of Damietta that had been re-consecrated into a church. One month later, Damietta had to be abandoned. John subsequently spent his childhood in the Holy Land where his siblings Peter (1251) and Blanche (1253) were born.  Marriage  His father wished that John joined the Dominican Order, but John resisted this wish successfully. In 1266, he was married to Yolande II, Countess of Nevers (1247‚Äì1280), making him Count of Nevers, Auxerre and Tonnere. In 1268, John was made Count of Valois and Cr√©py on his own right by his father the king, a gift he received as par√©age.  Crusade  Two years later, John accompanied his father during the Eighth Crusade, which reached Tunis in July after setting out from Cagliari on Sardinia. But at Tunis the army suffered an outbreak of dysentery. John Tristan was one of the victims who died of it, and three weeks later, St. Louis also succumbed to the disease. Both bodies were transported to France and buried in the Basilica of St Denis. John's marriage remained childless. His widow married again in 1272 with Robert III of Flanders; the county of Valois, his prerogative, returned to the Crown.

James and Williams met at school in Reading, and first performed together as a duo covering material by The Byrds and Moby Grape. They met Lindsey-Clark at a folk club and the trio formed Montrose Avenue in 1996. Taylor and Everitt then completed the line-up and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records the following year. The limited edition She's Looking For Me EP, released in 1997, charted at #118 in the UK singles chart. This was then followed by their first mainstream single in March 1998, in which \\"Where Do I Stand\\" proved to be their only top 40 hit, charting at #38. \\"Shine\\" then followed up three months later charting at #59, before their final single \\"Start Again\\" released in October, charted at #58. Their only album, Thirty Days Out, was released a week after the release of \\"Start Again\\" on 12 October 1998 before charting at number 102 in the UK and at number 69 in Japan. Despite establishing a cult following in the Far East, The Montrose Avenue never released another album only to disband in 1999.

Life Peter was born at Atlit, Kingdom of Jerusalem, while his father led the Seventh Crusade. Back in France, he lived in Paris until 1269 when his father gave him in appanage the County of Alen√ßon. He accompanied his father to Tunis during Eighth Crusade (1270), but this expedition was a fiasco, because of the dysentery epidemic that decimated the army of crusaders. His father and his brother Jean Tristan succumbed to the disease. Following the death of his father in 1270, Louis XI, Peter's brother Philip became king of France. One of Philip III's first acts was to name Peter as regent in the event of his death. In December 1282, during the Sicilian Vespers, Peter marched his army to Naples to assist his uncle Charles I of Naples, stopping at Reggio Calabria. By January 1283, he was at Catona, a suburb of Reggio, when he was attacked by Aragonese mercenaries and killed. His body was taken to Paris, where he was buried, with his heart interred at the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins.

Bredeman first became a Soccer Shots franchisee in 2005 after working for Auntie Anne‚Äôs for over 8 years. In addition to running his franchise business in Lancaster, Pa., he became a partner of Soccer Shots in 2009, along with former collegiate soccer teammates Jeremy Sorzano and Jason Webb. Now a multi-million-dollar company, Soccer Shots has more than 70 territories across the United States and Canada and reaches about 100,000 children per year. Life and career Bredeman was born in Albany, Ga. and grew up in northern Virginia. He began playing soccer at age 5 and went on to play club soccer for the Braddock Road Firebirds in Virginia. He played NCAA division III soccer at Messiah College in Grantham, Pa., where he became co-captain. At Messiah, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. At Auntie Anne‚Äôs, Inc., a franchise company that specializes in hand-rolled soft pretzels in retail centers, Bredeman gained his franchise experience in his roles as Store Support Representative, International Operations Specialist, Northeast Regional Director and National Director of Store Support. As National Director of Store Support, he oversaw five regional directors in the United States that supported over 280 franchisees and nearly 800 Auntie Anne‚Äôs stores. In 2005, Bredeman purchased a Soccer Shots franchise in Lancaster, Pa., which he has been running since. In 2006, he became the Director of Development for HOPE International, a faith- based non-profit focused on microenterprise development in impoverished countries around the world.

He was director of the LCTP from 2005 to 2011 and Victor Weisskopf Collegiate Professor of Physics from 2002 - 2011. He received the Lilienfeld Prize from the American Physical Society in 2012, and the J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics in 2017. Kane is an internationally recognized scientific leader in theoretical and phenomenological particle physics, and theories for physics beyond the Standard Model. In recent years he has been a leader in string phenomenology. Kane has been with the University of Michigan since 1965. Work =Early fundamental research= In 1982 Kane co-led the international Snowmass working group study that pointed to the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) as the next scientific direction for particle physics. Kane suggested, along with Jack Gunion, at Snowmass studies that Higgs bosons could be best detected at the SSC or LHC via the rare gamma gamma decay mode (finally documented in Nucl. Phys. B 299 (1988) 231, also with Wudka.). The SSC project was finally halted and replaced by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Geneva where this was indeed the discovery method. The LHC continues to probe for the presence of supersymmetry, the leading candidate model for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Around the same time Kane and Leveille performed the first calculation of the Feynman rules for gluinos, and of the production of gluinos at colliders, which turns out to be one of the most important ways to discover supersymmetry at the LHC. Gordon Kane is also well known for his work with Howard Haber, putting together and elucidating the structure of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) into a complete and calculable context in 1984. Their seminal article published in 1985 remains one of the single most important references on supersymmetry and the MSSM. A detailed companion report was published in 2002. Kane made important early contributions to the study of the Higgs Bosons, including an upper limit on the Higgs Boson mass, implications of electric dipole moments, the muon g-2 experiment, the study of dark matter and its detection,For a complete list of early work, see Publications linked above and to early supergravity and string theory phenomenology. With collaborators he pointed out the potential LHC inverse problem and solutions towards its resolution. =Recent notable research= Kane‚Äôs more recent work has been in the development of testable models based on string theory, in particular those based on G2 compactifications of M-Theory, a predictive approach that might explain the hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. With colleagues, he has recently re- emphasized the role of neutralino dark matter in the context of cosmic ray data, as well as the importance of connecting dark matter and the LHC - in particular focusing on light gluinos and light neutralinos (the putative superparteners of the gluon and W boson respectively) that arise in supergravity and string theory motivated models. He has argued that these ideas form a consistent framework with a non-thermal cosmological history of the universe. Recently, he and collaborators have generalized results of compactified string theories, and in particular have shown that scalar superpartners should have masses of order tens of TeV. He and collaborators have also proposed string motivated explanations for major questions in particle theory, including the so-called \\"little hierarchy\\" or \\"fine-tuning\\" problem, and major related questions in cosmology, including understanding the ratio of the baryonic matter to dark matter in the universe. =Scientific summary= Kane has published over 200 research articles, with over 20,000 citations and an h-number of 65. He has written or co-authored or edited at least 10 physics books, and has 3 influential Scientific American particle physics articles. A chapter from one book was reprinted in an anthology, with other chapters by Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Hawking, Maxwell, Heisenberg, Weinberg. Two of his more recent books includes ‚ÄúPerspectives on Supersymmetry‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPerspectives on LHC Physics‚Äù, both of which provide extensive reviews of the field. Kane has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the British Institute of Physics, and a Guggenheim Fellow. He has served on many government advisory panels, most recently as Chair of the theoretical physics subpanel on the three year Committee of Visitors of the Physical and Mathematical Sciences Division of the National Science Foundation, the highest evaluation panel the NSF has. Kane also has been on several national laboratory program policy committees. He has served on the international advisory committees of over 40 national and international meetings. He was a winner of the 1998 Physics Today Essay Contest \\"Physics Tomorrow\\". He has been Delphasus Lecturer at the University of California at Santa Cruz, Distinguished Visiting Speaker at the University of California Davis, Dozer Lecturer at Ben-Gurion University, Lewiner Lecturer at the Technion in Tel-Aviv, and an American Physical Society Centennial Speaker. In 2017, Kane was awarded the prestigious, J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics. The prize, considered one of the most prestigious in physics, was awarded for his work on the theory of the properties, reactions, and signatures of the Higgs boson. He has two popular books for any curious reader, ‚ÄúThe Particle Garden‚Äù, focusing on the Standard Model, and ‚ÄúSupersymmetry and Beyond‚Äù focusing on physics beyond the Standard Model, including string/M-theory.

After a meeting of the chief citizens, a name was selected and the first issue of the ‚ÄúPostville Review‚Äù came off the press on March 19, 1873. He sold his interests in 1875 to W. N. Burdick who published it until his death in 1901 when it passed on to his sons, A. E. and A. S. Burdick. They continued to publish it until it ceased in 1921. The ‚ÄúIowa Volksblatt‚Äù, a German newspaper, served the community for many years. There was a large influx of German people in this area who could not read or write the English language but most of them could read or write German. They discussed the subject of a German newspaper with their pastor, Rev. J. Gass. In 1891 Rev. Gass began the publication of the ‚ÄúIowa Volksblatt.‚Äù In 1895 he transferred the management of the paper to his printers, Henry Brechler and Guxtav Dietsch of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By this time the paper was well established. Mr. Dietsch bought his partners share in 1897 and published the paper alone until 1908 when he sold his plant and office building to Paul Ronneburger and Sam Hoesly of Monroe, Wis. William J. Klingbeil of Monroe purchase Sam Hoesly‚Äôs half interest in the paper on June 1, 1914. In 1918 he also bought Mr. Ronneburgers‚Äô interest, changed the name to the ‚ÄúPostville Herald‚Äù and began to publish in English rather than German. Consequently, the Herald was a direct descendant of the Volksblatt, with its roots dating back to 1891. In order to ensure success of his new paper he employed the dean of Postville‚Äôs newsmen, Bert Tuttle of the ‚ÄúReview‚Äù. Bert served as assistant and managing editor for over 55 years. He probably knew more about Postville and the papers on which he worked than any other individual in the community. It is said that he alone got Ringling Brothers Circus to come to Postville in 1916. Klingbeil served as editor and publisher of the paper until 1948 with the exception of about two years. He sold his interest in the paper to C. W. DeGarmo and Fred L. Martin. After the death of Mr. DeGarmo, James Seeley became partners with Fred Martin until Martins death. In 1985 Seeley sold the paper to Patrick Huber of Clarksville, Iowa. He was the sole publisher of the Herald from 1985 to 1991. The Wisconsin-based News Publishing Company of Mt. Horeb began a competing publication, the Postville Leader. Later the same year, the Herald was bought out by the Leader and the publication was renamed the Postville Herald-Leader. The Herald-Leader was purchased and renamed the Postville Herald at the end October 2009 by Meyer Information Technology. The paper‚Äôs motto, ‚ÄúA Live Newspaper for a Live Community Since 1892‚Äù has been a part of the paper‚Äôs history for many years. As of January 1, 2015 the Herald was purchased by Mid America Publishing of Hampton, Iowa. The Herald covers Postville City government and the news of Postville Community Schools. It covers news of Castalia and Frankville, as well as news of Allamakee, Clayton, Fayette, and Winneshiek counties.

In this case, a student's section 8 rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\\"Charter\\") were not violated by being searched by a school principal with a police constable present. Background A vice-principal of a junior high school in Nova Scotia had been informed by some students that another student, M.R., had planned to sell drugs at an upcoming school dance. The vice-principal asked M.R. and his friend to come to his office. The vice-principal advised them that he was going to search them for drugs. An RCMP officer, who had been called there by the vice-principal according to school policy, was in the office but did not interfere. M.R. emptied his pockets and, after being asked by the vice-principal to do so, pulled up his pant legs. There was a bulge in his sock. The vice-principal removed a plastic bag of marijuana. The bag was given to the police officer who advised M.R. that he was under arrest for possession of a narcotic. The constable read the police caution to M.R., told him that he had a right to counsel (a lawyer) and that he had the right to contact a parent or adult. M.R. tried to reach his mother but was not able to get in touch with her. He said that he did not want to call anyone else. The officer and M.R. then went to M.R.'s locker and searched it. No more drugs were found. The case went to court. M.R.'s lawyer argued that his client's rights had been violated. Cousel pointed to two sections of the Charter. First, section 8 guarantees everyone has the right to be secure against \\"unreasonable search and seizure\\". Second, section 10(b) states that \\"everyone has the right on arrest or detention to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\\". According to the defence, both sections had been violated. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court disagreed. First, it was assumed, for the purposes of this case, that schools were a part of government and that the Charter therefore applied to the actions of the vice-principal. Second, in order for an action to be a \\"search or seizure\\" under the Charter, the person being searched must have a \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\". Given he was a student, did M.R. have \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\"? The Supreme Court held he did not: \\"The reasonable expectation of privacy of a student in attendance at a school is certainly less than it would be in other circumstances. Students know that their teachers and other school authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment and maintaining order and discipline in the school. They must know that this may sometimes require searches of students and their personal effects and the seizure of prohibited items. It would not be reasonable for a student to expect to be free from such searches.\\" In fact, the provincial Education Act implied that searches were reasonable and acceptable. The court concluded that the search was authorized by law, that the law was reasonable, and (in this particular case) that the vice-principal had acted reasonably. Moreover, the court ruled that a teacher or principal does not have to get a warrant to search a student if he or she has reasonable grounds (a good reason) to believe that a school rule has been or is being broken and if he or she has good reason to believe that evidence of the violation will be found in the location or on the person of the student searched. Reasonable grounds can be information received from just one student if the principal or teacher thinks that the student is credible. Third, M.R.'s lawyer had argued that section 10(b) had been violated because his client had not received counsel immediately after being detained in the vice-principal's office. The court ruled that this section did not apply to \\"detentions\\" within a school environment since it was designed to apply to cases where a person was detained by the police during a criminal investigation. The factors to be considered in determining whether a search conducted by a teacher or principal in the school environment was reasonable can be summarized in this manner: # The first step is to determine whether it can be inferred from the provisions of the relevant Education Act that teachers and principals are authorized to conduct searches of their students in appropriate circumstances. In the school environment such a statutory authorization would be reasonable. # The search itself must be carried out in a reasonable manner. It should be conducted in a sensitive manner and be minimally intrusive. # In order to determine whether a search was reasonable, all the surrounding circumstances will have to be considered.

Of these, one hundred and four contribute to its historical integrity. Cedar City was originally an iron works near the Latter-day Saint city of Parowan. After Brigham Young shut down the iron facilities, two-thirds of Cedar City's residents left for other settlements. The remaining families prospered from sheep ranching. The Union Pacific Railroad connected to the town in the early 1900s and provided a tourism boom for the city. The district represents some of the oldest houses for Cedar City residents, most of which were farmers or ranchers. Later houses in the district represent early 20th century revivals. History After Brigham Young established Salt Lake City in northern Utah Territory, he sent out groups of Mormon families to colonize new lands. Young envisioned a self- sufficient Latter-day Saint state, and one important resource required by the Latter-day Saints was iron. Young sent one hundred and sixty-one people led by Danish settler Jens Nielson to start the city of Parowan in 1851 to reap the nearby iron deposits. The iron was found in modern-day Cedar City, and thirty- five men constructed an iron works there in November 1851. Young chartered Cedar City a few months later. The iron mined from Cedar City was the first west of the Mississippi River. Following a series of mishaps, including the Mountain Meadows massacre, Young ordered the iron works to shut down in 1858. Most Cedar City citizens left for other cities, but three hundred and one people stayed behind. Location of the Cedar City Historic District within Cedar City Cedar City spent the next few decades as an agrarian town. Sheep ranching became a lucrative business for the settlers, enabling several to build two-story, brick Victorian houses. By 1880, the population had grown to 740, creating a demand for public and religious buildings. Branch Agricultural College was founded in 1897, and by 1904, the city had electricity and plumbing. The town raised $100,000 to purchase a right-of-way for the Union Pacific Railroad in 1899. Following a railroad connection, Cedar City focused on drawing tourists. Its proximity to Cedar Breaks National Monument, Zion National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park was advertised by Union Pacific. Tourists would arrive in Cedar City and then take buses to the parks. Cedar City's population doubled in the 1920s. Though most residents of the historic district were still agricultural, the new residents brought Colonial, Tudor, and Renaissance Revival buildings to the district. Though the city struggled through The Great Depression, new iron mines opened after World War II prompted further economic growth.

He was born in Birmingham on 27 August 1800. He was the eldest son of Thomas Baker of that town. After the usual school education; and when unusually young for such a charge, he took the management of Baylis's school at Dudley. One of hie early friends and advisers was the Rev. John Kentish, of Birmingham; another was the Rev. James Hews Bransby, of Dudley, who directed his private studies by way of preparing him for the University of Glasgow, with the view of his ultimately becoming a Unitarian minister. By the aid of a grant from Dr. Daniel Williams's trustees he was enabled to go to Glasgow, where he spent three sessions and graduated M.A. On the completion of his college course in 1823 he was invited to become minister of Bank Street Unitarian Chapel, Bolton, a charge which he accepted, though there had been dissensions there which made his work difficult. His connection with the chapel lasted for forty years, during which time the congregation became one of the most prosperous in the county, and the chapel was entirely rebuilt. In his earlier time, when the dissenters were battling for equal rights, he engaged in the political movements of the day, but his after-life was devoted to the work of his calling and the promotion of the charitable and educational institutions of the town. No one in that community was more heartily respected than Baker, and he received gratifying testimony of this in an offer from the Lord Lieutenant of the county to insert his name in the commission of the peace. He did not, however, consider it consistent with his position to accept it. Besides occasional sermons and pamphlets on matters of passing interest, he was the author of various articles in the Penny Cyclop√¶dia. He also published in 1854 a History of the Rise and Progress of Nonconformity in Bolton. This work is a valuable and accurate record, covering a period of 200 years. He resigned his ministerial position in 1864, and retired to Caton, on the banks of the River Lune, but at the end of three years he removed to Birmingham, where he could have the attention of a brother, who held a high medical position. He died on 26 May 1867. Family Franklin Baker was the eldest son and third of ten children of Thomas Baker, headmaster of the Lancasterian School, Birmingham, and his wife, Charlotte Mould. Several of the children attained unusual distinction. In addition to Franklin Baker, they included Charles Baker, famous as an instructor of deaf people; Sir Thomas Baker (1810‚Äì1886), Unitarian minister at Sidmouth in 1833‚Äì4 and later a solicitor in Manchester where he was active in municipal affairs, mayor, and historian of the Unitarian congregation of Cross Street Chapel; Alfred Baker (1815‚Äì1893), an eminent Birmingham surgeon; and Harriet (1805‚Äì1850), who married Edward White Benson (1800‚Äì1843) and became mother of a second Edward White Benson (1829‚Äì1896), archbishop of Canterbury in 1882‚Äì96. On 30 September 1835 Baker had married Mary Crook (1802‚Äì1879), daughter of Jeremiah Crook, a Liverpool merchant formerly of Bolton, another of whose daughters married Baker's brother Thomas; there were no children.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Bradstreet was employed by government officials to act as a spy among the rebels. His description of a \\"third force\\" of 9,000 men in Northampton ready to fight the Scots (a force which did not in fact exist) is credited with persuading Bonnie Prince Charlie's army to turn back at a council of war in Derby in 1745, effectively ending the Jacobite cause. Biography He was born in 1711 in Tipperary, where his father had obtained considerable property under the Cromwellian grants, which, however, was much reduced by debts. Dudley, his youngest son, was left in his early years in charge of a foster father in Tipperary. While a youth he became a trooper, but soon quit the army and traded unsuccessfully as a linen merchant, and subsequently as a brewer. For several years, in Ireland and England, Bradstreet led an erratic life, occupied mainly in pecuniary projects. Jacobite Uprising of 1745 Bonnie Prince Charlie During the rising of 1745, Bradstreet was employed by government officials to act as a spy among suspected persons. He was also engaged and equipped by the Dukes of Newcastle and Cumberland to furnish them with information on the movements of Prince Charles Edward and his army. Bradstreet assumed the character of a devoted adherent to the Stuart cause, and, under the name of 'Captain Oliver Williams,' obtained access to the prince and his council at Derby. There he acted successfully as a spy for the Duke of Cumberland, and, without being suspected by the Jacobites, persuaded Charles Stuart's army to turn back, by warning of a \\"third force\\" of 9,000 men in Northampton ready to fight the Scots (a force which did not in fact exist). After the council, Bradstreet continued on good terms with the rebels, and took his leave as a friend when they commenced their return march to Scotland, a decision which ended Jacobite hopes of seizing London and the Crown. Bradstreet's notices of Prince Charles and his associates are graphic. He describes circumstantially the executions, in August 1746, of the Earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino, at which he states he was present. Later life Although Bradstreet's services as a secret agent were admitted by the government officials, he was unable to obtain from them either money or a commission in the army, which he considered had been promised to him. He, however, succeeded in bringing his case under the notice of the king, from whom he consequently received the sum of one hundred and twenty pounds. Bradstreet subsequently subsisted for a time on the results of schemes, his success in which he ascribed to the 'superstition' of the English people, and 'their credulity and faith in wondrous things.' The last of his devices at London appears to have been that styled the 'bottle conjurer,' which, with the assistance of several confederates, he carried out with great gains in January 1747-8. On his adventures in connection with the affair Bradstreet wrote a play, in five acts, styled 'The Magician, or the Bottle Conjurer,' which he states was revised for him by some of the best judges and actors in England, including Mrs. Woffington, who gave him 'the best advice she could about it.' This play was four times performed with great success at London, but on the fifth night, when Bradstreet was to have taken the part of 'Spy,' the principal character, it was suppressed by the magistrates of Westminster. 'The Bottle Conjurer' was printed by Bradstreet with his 'Life.' After other adventures, Bradstreet returned to Ireland, where he owned a small property in land. He attempted unsuccessfully to carry on trade as a brewer in Westmeath, and became involved in contests with officials of the excise. To raise funds, he printed an account of his life and adventures (The Life and Uncommon Adventures of Captain Dudley Bradstreet, S. Powell, Dublin, 1755). The work is written with vivacity and descriptive power. Bradstreet died at Multifarnham, Westmeath, in 1763.

He was the son of Robert Bradstreet, and was born at Higham, Suffolk, in 1766, and educated under the care of the Rev. T. Foster, rector of Halesworth in Suffolk. On 4 June 1782 he was admitted a pensioner of St. John's College, Cambridge, and he became a fellow-commoner of that society on 23 January 1786. The dates of his degrees are B.A. 1786, M.A. 1789. Bradstreet owned an estate at Bentley in Suffolk, with a mansion called Bentley Grove, which, it is believed, he inherited from his father. He lived abroad for several years, witnessing many of the scenes of the French revolution, which he at one time advocated. He married in France, but took advantage of the facility with which the marriage tie could there be dissolved, and on his return to England he married, in 1800, Miss Adham of Mason's Bridge, near Hadleigh, Suffolk, by whom he had a numerous family. For some time he lived at Higham Hall, Raydon, but removing thence, he resided at various places, and at length died at Southampton on 13 May 1836.

He was instituted to the prebend of Nassington, in the church of Lincoln on 2 May 1683, and to that of Basset Parva, in the church of Lichfield, 15 July 1697. In 1699 he took the degree of D.D. On 30 January 1701, being then proctor of the Diocese of Lichfield, he preached before the lower house of convocation a sermon on the martyrdom of Charles I of England, in which he drew a parallel between it and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, maintaining that having regard to the superior dignity of a king of England in actual possession of his crown as compared with one who was merely an uncrowned king of the Jews, and moreover disclaimed temporal sovereignty, the execution at Whitehall was an act of greater enormity than was committed at Calvary. The sermon having been printed was brought to the notice of the House of Lords, and a suggestion was made that it should be publicly burned. The peers, however, contented themselves with resolving that it contained 'several expressions that give just scandal and offence to all Christian people.' On 19 June 1703 he was installed dean of Lichfield. In 1705 he was appointed prolocutor to convocation. In the early 1700s (1704 has been found written on the plaster inside the house and in 1706, an Act of Queen Anne annexed the rectoryship to the Dean), he built a fine Queen Anne rectory in Tatenhill, Staffordshire which is a Grade II* listed building. In 2008, this house was one of four finalists for Country Life magazine's ‚ÄúEngland's Finest Parsonage‚Äù contest., \\"England's Finest Parsonage\\", having won the West of England section. He died on 19 June 1712 and was buried at Leamington, of which place he had been vicar. Dean Binckes built the existing deanery at Lichfield. He published his sermons between 1702 and 1716.

It was originally based entirely in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA; it is now a British Columbia, Canada Corporation based in Kelowna. Its qualifications are similar to those of the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) at the recreational level, but IYT Worldwide also offers additional courses at the professional level. It is regulated by a number of Maritime Administrations and has an ISO Quality Management System to independently monitor and control all of its training standards.IYT Fort Lauderdale History IYT Worldwide was founded by Mark Fry in 1998 as a credible alternative to the RYA with the purpose of providing training for crews of superyachts by offering professional yachtsmen and women the opportunity to train for their career outside the UK, a first for the professional yachting fraternity. IYT Worldwide was approved, and its courses recognized by the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA),in October 1999 and is now recognized as a world leader by multiple administrations due to its numerous (20 plus) international recognitions covering a large number of its courses. IYT has trained over 110,000 candidates in the last 12 years. Due to its dedication to high standards, quality training and the implementation of its ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System, the company has enjoyed an international expansion which now includes almost 300 partner schools in 56 countries. No other yacht training organisation is as internationally recognised or accepted as IYT. Global spread Initially recognized for its professional courses, IYT has successfully developed professional, recreational and other boating watersports courses delivered through licensed training schools. There are currently 271 partner schools around the world in 56 different countries (October 2017). These include Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Croatia,Cyprus, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, French West Indies, Gibraltar, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, St Maarten, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, St Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine,United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States. Membership There are basically 2 membership levels, those partner schools offering recreational courses and those offering professional yachting courses such as Master of Yachts (MOY) and STCW, Basic Safety Training. Two levels of qualification may be obtained from IYT Worldwide training providers: Level 1 * Recreational boating courses from ‚ÄòIntroduction to Boating‚Äô through ‚ÄòRecreational Yachtmaster Coastal, Yachmaster Offshore and Yachtmaster Ocean‚Äô ( Modules 1 to 21 in the IYT Passport booklet) * VHF SRC Radio Operators Certificate * Small Powerboat & RIB Master (includes VHF certification) * Superyacht Deck Crew (includes Small Powerboat & RIB Master and VHF) * Superyacht Interior Crew * International Certificate of Competency (ICC) * Personal Watercraft Operations Level 2 * Master of Yacht Training (MOY) ‚Äì Mate 200 Ton/Coastal, Master of Yacht 200 Ton Limited and Master of Yacht 200 Ton Unlimited * STCW ‚Äò95 Basic Training ‚Äì (Standard of Training and Certification for Watchkeepers) 5 Modules over 6 days ‚Äì required by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) for employment on commercially operated yachts carrying passengers. * Diveboat Master Level 1 and Level 2 (includes General Engineering Knowledge) International Certificate of Competence - ICC International Certificate of Competence Also referred to as International Certificate of Competency, may be required to operate a vessel in EU waters, both coastal and internal. It is a certificate which is similar to an International Drivers License. An International Certificate of Competence (ICC) is a certificate which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain national boating licenses or met the ICC Standards of Knowledge and practical competencies. Almost all member states within the European Union have accepted the IYT World ICC. Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution 40, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required. In general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of Europe and for inland and coastal waters of Mediterranean countries. For the coastal waters of Northern Europe the ICC is generally not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

Biography Beloe was born at Norwich the son of a tradesman, and received a liberal education. After a day school in Norwich he was schooled under the Rev. Matthew Raine, who taught at Hartforth; and subsequently under Samuel Parr, whom he describes as \\"severe, wayward, and irregular\\". His departure from Parr's school at Stanmore was hastened by quarrels with his schoolfellows, and at Benet College, Cambridge he got into trouble by writing epigrams. Parr, on becoming headmaster of Norwich grammar school, offered him the assistant mastership. Beloe held this post for three years, but seemingly unhappily. During his time at Norwich Beloe married, and then went to London, where he worked for publishers. In 1793 he established, with Robert Nares, the British Critic, the first forty-two volumes of which were partly edited by him. He also, according to his biographer in the Gentleman's Magazine, \\"gave his assistance in editing various books of considerable popularity and importance, which it is less expedient to specify\\", doubtless because the reputed authors' obligations to him were too extensive. In 1796 Beloe was presented to the rectory of Allhallows, London Wall, and in 1803 became keeper of printed books at the British Museum. Being held responsible for thefts by a person named Dighton, he was dismissed from the Museum in 1806. He died on 11 April 1817, embittered by ill-health and other circumstances not precisely stated. Works One of Beloe's publisher commissions was to translate Samuel Parr's preface to Bellendenus into English, a piece of work that impressed Richard Porson. He successively brought out translations of Coluthus, Alciphron (with Thomas Monro), Herodotus, and Aulus Gellius (preface by Parr); and co-operated in William Tooke's Biographical Dictionary. He published (1795) three volumes of miscellanies. Beloe persevered in his Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books, started with his appointment at the British Museum. Two volumes appeared in 1806; and by the assistance of Earl Spencer, the Bishop of Ely, and other patrons, he published four more, the last appearing in 1812. The work was supported by the advice of Isaac Reed. The Sexagenarian, or Recollections of a Literary Life, Beloe's final work, had just passed the press at the time of his death, and was published immediately afterwards under the editorship of Thomas Rennell. It caused a furore. Dr. Butler, head master of Shrewsbury School, criticised it severely in the Monthly Review, and Parr, in the catalogue of his library, wrote he was \\"compelled to record the name of Beloe as an ingrate and a slanderer\\". Via Robert Southey's library, a key was published in 1860 to some of those alluded to indirectly in the book. Family In 1780 Beloe married in Norwich Mary Anne Rix, daughter of William Rix of London. Of their children, four sons survived him, and a daughter Margaret, who married a William. Margaret Louisa Harriet Beloe who married William Scott was a granddaughter, son of William Beloe, and mother of Clement William Scott the theatre critic.

Situated well away from the sea near Kielder in Northumberland, the base was an assessment and rehabilitation centre for naval personnel diagnosed with personality disorders. Origins Prior to the Second World War the Ministry of Labour had established a number of training centres for unemployed men, one of these was Kielder Camp. In 1941 the Navy was growing increasingly concerned about the number of men suffering from behaviourial problems, which prevented them from carrying out full duties. A variety of locations were considered before it was decided to take over the by now deserted labour camp near Kielder. Although the camp was taken over in 1941 it was not until early 1942 that it was commissioned as HMS Standard and the first men posted there. Personnel Men posted to the base fell into three categories; those with low morale, men of temperamental instability, and malingerers. The aim was to return these men not necessarily to active service but to some form of effective service. The base was not a hospital, it was under the command of officers of the Royal Navy executive branch rather than Royal Naval Medical Service, although two Royal Navy psychiatrists were assigned to the base staff. Regime The regime of the base had an emphasis on physical labour and education to support the overall aim of returning the men to effective service. Rather than a general regime, each man was assessed and a personalised regime of work, recreation and education established. Statistics During the three years HMS Standard was operational, 842 men were assessed of whom 680 were classed as 'successes' because they were drafted to other duties within the Navy with the average period at Standard being four months. Of those redrafted the records are incomplete but some performed well enough to be decorated, while over 100 were the subject later in their service careers of bad reports. The remaining 162 men were all discharged from the Navy. Closure HMS Standard was decommissioned in July 1945 after the end of the war in Europe, subsequently the camp became a labour camp for Polish refugees before becoming a Forestry Commission depot. The site of the camp was flooded with the creation of Kielder Water in 1980.

Born into a family of Devon gentry, he began as a conservative supporter of the Church of England, but gradually became more radical. He was expelled from the church following the 1662 Act of Uniformity, and became a Nonconformist; he spent nine years in prison, where he preached, and established congregations of Seventh Day Baptists. After his release in 1672, he spent another 18 months in jail for preaching without an alliance, and moved to London in 1674, where he continued his activities. Arrested again in 1683, he refused on principle to swear the Oath of allegiance, and was sent to Newgate Prison, where he died of fever in February 1684. Biography Francis Bampfield was the third son of John Bampfield of Poltimore House, and his wife Elizabeth Drake. Like many other members of the Devon gentry, his brothers and father supported Parliament during the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. His elder brother Sir John Bampfylde (1610‚Äì1650), was Member of Parliament for Penryn, who was excluded from Parliament by Pride's Purge in December 1648. His younger brother Thomas Bampfield (1623‚Äì1693) was MP for Exeter between 1654 and 1660, and Speaker of the Commons for a short period on 1659. In September 1673, he married Damaris Town (died 1694); originally from Limerick, her father lost his estates in the 1641 Irish Revolt. They met when he was in Dorchester prison; after his release, she accompanied him on his preaching itineraries, and he apparently married her to avoid scandal. Career Bampfield's associate and mentor, Richard Baxter, the 'Puritan saint' His parents intended him for a life in the church, and had him privately educated by 'pious families'; in 1631, he entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he earned two degrees, graduating in 1638. 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500‚Äì1714: Baal- Barrow', Alumni Oxonienses 1500‚Äì1714: Abannan-Kyte (1891), pp. 51‚Äì78. Date accessed: 20 November 2011 He reacted against his Puritan upbringing by supporting reforms to the Church of England made by Archbishop Laud. Ordained in 1639, he was appointed rector in the Devon village of Rampisham; provided with a private income from his father, he spent his stipend from this position on his parishioners. In May 1641, he was made a Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. Unlike most of his family, Francis supported the Royalists when the First English Civil War began in August 1642. He continued using the Book of Common Prayer, until forced to stop by Parliamentary troops; he later denounced it as an \\"unclean constitution of humanely invented worship\\". In 1647, he moved to the parish of Wraxall, Somerset, and a few years later became an associate of Richard Baxter, a cleric known as the 'Puritan saint', and supporter of the Reformation of Manners. In line with its precepts, he tried to impose greater moral discipline on his parishioners, replacing games and other popular pastimes with religious study. He was removed from Wraxall in 1653, and began preaching at Sherborne; in 1657 he was installed in a service reportedly attended by over 2,000 people. Following the 1660 Restoration, he was restored as prebendary, while Baxter recommended him for a bishopric. However, he was evicted from his living after the 1662 Act of Uniformity; he was arrested for preaching without a license, and spent most of the next nine years in Dorchester gaol. While in prison, he became a convinced supporter of Saturday Sabbatarianism, and established a Seventh-day Baptist Church. After his release in 1672, he became an itinerant preacher, and was soon sentenced to another eighteen months in Salisbury jail. He moved to London in 1674, where he established several Sabbatarian Baptist congregations. However, he was unsuccessful in his wider ambition of building an international association to train ministers, educate children in Hebrew, and convert Jews. In February 1683, he was arrested; although he had links to the Presbyterian radical Robert Ferguson, he was not involved in his conspiracies. Committed to court in March, he refused on principle to swear the Oath of allegiance, and was sent to Newgate Prison, where he died of fever on 16 February 1684. Large crowds of sympathisers attended his funeral at the Anabaptists' burial-ground in Aldersgate Street. A contemporary noted he was 'first a churchman, then a Presbyterian, afterward an Independent, then an Anabaptist, and finally, almost a complete Jew.' Works His works include: * The Judgment of Mr. Francis Bampfield for the Observation of the Jewish or Seventh-day Sabbath, 1672. * The Seventh-day Sabbath the Desirable Day, 1677. * All in One: All Useful Sciences and Profitable Arts in the One Book of Jehovah Elohim, 1677. * A Name, an After One, 1681. * The House of Wisdom, 1681. * The Lord's Free Prisoner, 1683. * A Just Appeal from the Lower Courts on Earth to the Highest Court in Heaven, 1683. * A Continuation of the former Just Appeal, 1683. * The Holy Scripture the Scripture of Truth, 1684.

Speakeasy Tiger was founded in 2008 by Kyle Simmons (vocals), Peter Schmidt (piano, synth, keytar) and Lauren Gale (bass). Shortly thereafter members Lucas Gordon (drums) and Tavis Alley (guitar) were recruited to finish the band's lineup. In early 2010 vocalist Kyle Simmons left Speakeasy Tiger and was replaced by frontwoman Katrina Stone. In the fall of 2010 the group announced it would take an indefinite hiatus after members Katrina Stone and Peter Schmidt left the band. History =Formation and debut album (2008‚Äì2010)= In the summer of 2008 original vocalist Kyle Simmons took her solo folk project Girl Named Kyle in a different direction, pairing with Peter Schmidt and Lauren Gale to form a backing band for her improvised compositions. Soon after the Denver-based group changed its name to Speakeasy Tiger after making the decision to change genres of music from folk to pop. The name Speakeasy Tiger was derived as a satirical play on the words speakeasy and blind tiger, which individually are both slang for the reference of illegal establishments selling alcohol during Prohibition. Original vocalist Kyle Simmons is quoted saying: The group began looking for members to finish the line up in November 2008. They found drummer Lucas Gordon hailing from Colorado Springs, Colorado, having previously played in the metalcore band The Murder Formula. Promptly after, guitarist Tavis Alley, who attended Brigham Young University at the time, was recruited to the Mile High City to finish the line up after responding to a Facebook ad from the band looking for guitarists. Lucas Gordon comments on the change: Speakeasy Tiger released its debut album The Public on July 11, 2009. The album was an immediate success reaching the College Music Journal Billboard top 200 albums chart. It peaked at position 142 and was a top 20 add for the week of August 29, 2009. In November 2009, the group went back into the studio to remaster the single off The Public entitled \\"Oil Rising\\" at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producer Lee Miles. The single was released in April 2010 shortly before the departure of vocalist Kyle Simmons. =Addition & Departure of Katrina Stone (2010)= In May 2010 after rumors of vocalist Kyle Simmons' struggles with other band mates the band revealed the vocalist's departure from the band. After canceling a string of tour dates, the group took a small hiatus to search for a new vocalist. In June 2010 Speakeasy Tiger announced the addition of frontwoman Katrina Stone as an indefinite member while assuring they would not be canceling summer tour dates on The Vans Warped Tour. Not long after the tour, however, Schmidt and Stone announced to the band that they were quitting, providing little explanation why. The band was in pre-production on a new EP at the time, but the project has since been abandoned. Speakeasy Tiger has since been on hiatus. Musical style and influences * Speakeasy Tiger blends a mix of several different genres together including American rock, pop, post-Britpop, and electro. Band members have stated various musical influences including Freddie Mercury, Cyndi Lauper, BT, Coldplay, The Killers, and Jimmy Eat World. * Speakeasy Tiger has been hailed for its use of the Keytar, an instrument which was popular in the early 1980s. * Fans and critics have often compared the group to Muse, The Killers, Paramore, No Doubt, and Blondie =Music with a voice= Band members have stated that when writing music, they feel compelled to create music that manifests feelings of love, compassion, and caring in listeners. The group has teamed with various non- profit organizations including Keep A Breast and online blogs including Vans Girls Blog to promote a national sense of community through music.

Biography He was a townsman and presumably a native of Hull; but his name does not appear in any list of naval officers during the civil war or until 26 September 1650, when an order was sent by the parliament to the council of state to appoint him \`as commander of the ship now to be built at Woolwich, or any other ship that they think fit.¬¥ This is the earliest mention of him as yet known. That his appointment was irregular and gave offence to his subordinates, officers of some experience at sea, and that he had neither the knowledge nor the ability to enforce obedience to his orders, appears throughout his whole correspondence, which gives an account of his sailing in the Leopard of 50 guns, of his arrival at Smyrna with the convoy, of his sailing thence in April 1651, and of his successive arrivals at Zante, Messina, Naples, and Genoa. In November 1651 he went to Leghorn, and immediately off that port captured, or permitted the ships with him to capture, a French vessel; thus, at the outset, giving offence to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. After staying a month at Leghorn he left for Naples, and with the Levant trade sailed again to Smyrna, returning to Leghorn in the end of June 1652. The war with the Dutch Republic had just broken out, and a squadron of fourteen Dutch ships of war rendered it impossible for the English to move out. The force that Appleton had with him was not more than half that of the Dutch, and during the rest of the summer he attempted nothing beyond despatching the Constant Warwick to reinforce Commodore Richard Badiley, who was expected shortly on the coast of Italy. On 27 August 1652,. the Dutch learned that Badiley was off the island of Elba; and slipping out with their squadron, now of ten ships, they brought him to action, when, after a fight which lasted through that day and into the next, they succeeded in capturing the Phoenix. Appleton made no attempt to help Badiley, pleading afterwards ‚Äòthat the Lord had at that time visited him with a violent sickness;‚Äô to which Badiley answered that no one else knew of it, and that even if he was sick he ought still to have sent his ships. Badiley, after his defeat, retreated to Porto Longone, where he was blockaded by part of the Dutch squadron, the other part watching Appleton at Leghorn and refitting the Phoenix. On 2 November Badiley came overland to communicate with Appleton, having received instructions from home to take the entire command. It seems to have been then arranged between them that, in defiance of the neutrality of the port, an attempt should be made to retake the Phoenix, which was successfully carried into execution by Captain Cox on the evening of 20 November, or, according to New Style, 30 November, when the Dutch were holding drunken revelry in honour of St. Andrew. The grand duke was further incensed by Appleton's seizure next day of a Dutch prisoner who had escaped and put himself under the protection of a Tuscan sentry. The duke sent for Appleton, made him a close prisoner under circumstances of much indignity, and two days later sent him, still a prisoner, to Commodore Badiley at Porto Longone, who, holding a council of war, superseded him from the command of the Leopard; all which was approved of by the government at home, and orders were sent out for Appleton to return to England overland. It was, however, decided by Badiley to leave Appleton in command of the Leopard whilst the two squadrons combined to force their way past the Dutch, who had prevailed on the grand duke to give the English a peremptory order to restore the Phoenix or to quit the port. Appleton was accordingly sent back to his ship at Leghorn, and on 1 March 1653 Badiley wrote to him to be ready to come out to meet him as soon as he should appear off the port. Badiley's idea was that the Dutch would attack whichever squadron happened to be to leeward of them, and that the windward squadron might support it. They did not do so; but the wind being offshore, as soon as Appleton was well clear of the port on 4 March they fell on him, and before Badiley, who was a considerable distance to leeward, could come at all near, had completely crushed him. Of the six ships which formed his squadron one only escaped. The Leopard defended herself stoutly, till at last the ship's company refused to fight any longer, and would not permit the poop, which the enemy had won, to be blown up; they seized and disarmed Appleton, and called for quarter. He was held prisoner for some months, but being released on a security of 5,000 pieces of eight, he returned to England, complaining bitterly of having been deserted and betrayed. Inquiry showed that these complaints were unfounded, and that his defeat by the Dutch was due, not to any shyness on the part of Badiley, but to his own ill-judged haste in leaving the port before Badiley was engaged with the Dutch. Appleton was never employed again, and vanished from the historical record.

Biography He was born in 1794, was a younger son of the vicar of Epsom, Surrey, the Rev. Jonathan Boucher and Elizabeth James (n√©e Hodgson). Barton changed his name from Boucher to Bouchier after 1822. He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1816 he married Mary, daughter of the Rev. Nathaniel Thornbury, of Avening, Gloucestershire. He proceeded B.A. in 1822, and M.A. in 1827. Bouchier at first read for the bar. But he afterwards took holy orders and became curate at Monmouth. A sermon preached by him at Usk in 1822 for the Christian Knowledge Society was published by request. Bouchier held curacies later at Old, Northamptonshire (Gent. Mag. supra), A History of British Birds, Indigenous and Migratory: p. 99, MacGillivray, (London 1839). He was quoted from near this location describing the call of a Turdus merula. and (before 1834) at Cheam, Surrey, from which place he issued an edition of Bishop Andrewes's 'Prayers.' In 1836 he published 'Prophecy and Fulfilment,' a little book of corresponding texts; and in 1845 'Thomas Bradley,' a story of a poor parishioner, and the first of a series of similar pamphlets describing clerical experiences, collected and published in various editions as 'My Parish,' and 'The Country Pastor,' from 1855 to 1860. In 1852 Bouchier commenced the publication of his 'Manna in the House,' being expositions of the gospels and the Acts, lasting, with intervals, down to 1858; in 1854 he wrote his 'The Ark in the House,' being family prayers for a month; and in 1855 he wrote his 'Manna in the Heart,' being comments on the Psalms. In 1853 he wrote a 'Letter' to the prime minister (Lord Aberdeen) against opening the Crystal Palace on Sundays, following up this appeal in 1854 by 'The Poor Man's Palace,' &c.;, a pamphlet addressed to the Crystal Palace directors. In 1856 he published 'Solace in Sickness,' a collection of hymns, and in the same year was made rector of Fonthill Bishop, Wiltshire. He published his 'Farewell Sermon' to his Cheam flock, having preached it on 28 Sept. In 1864 he published 'The History of Isaac.' He died at the rectory 20 December 1864, aged 70. The editorship of 'The Vision,' a humorous illustrated poem on Jonathan Boucher's philological studies, written by Sir F. M. Eden, bart., and published in 1820, has been wrongly attributed to Bouchier.

He was a leading proponent of radical criticism in the Netherlands. Life Pierson's father was a merchant in Amsterdam, his mother an author of pietist works. The family was prominent in the Christian revival movement of the Reveil and attended the meetings of Isaac da Costa and Nicolaas Beets. Pierson studied theology at Utrecht University, where he was influenced by Opzoomer. He became a Protestant minister in Leuven in 1854, and in 1857 in the Walloon church in Rotterdam, where he was highly esteemed. However, in 1865 he resigned because he could not reconcile being a minister with not believing in divine revelation. He moved to Heidelberg, where he worked on a history of Christianity. He also started to teach at the university there. From 1877 to 1895 Pierson was professor in history of art, aesthetics and modern languages at the University of Amsterdam. Pierson died in 1896 in the village Almen and he is buried in Zutphen. Theology In 1878 Pierson published his book about the Sermon on the Mount and other passages from the synoptic gospels. He showed that sayings attributed to Jesus could be found in Jewish wisdom literature. The work also argued that Galatians, one of the core Pauline epistles, was pseudepigraphic. This is seen as the beginning of Dutch radical school. Pierson was an advocate of the Christ myth theory.Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans. p. 10. \\"Allard Pierson, its leader, flatly denied the existence of Jesus, and A. Loman and W.

He was a neo-impressionist influenced by Edvard Munch, Henri Matisse and contemporary French painting. He first participated at the Autumn exhibition in Kristiania in 1901, and had his first separate exhibition in 1904. He is represented at museums in many Scandinavian cities, including several paintings at the National Gallery of Norway. Karsten was known for his bohemian lifestyle and quick temper. Personal life Karsten was born in Christiana as the son of builder Hans Heinrich Karsten and Ida Susanne Pf√ºtzenreuter. He was a brother of designer Marie Karsten and architect Heinrich Joachim Sebastian Karsten. His daughter Alise was born in 1909 and raised in fosterage, until she later moved to Copenhagen to join her father and stepmother. In 1913 Karsten married the Danish sculptor Michaela (Misse) Frederikke Haslund (1886‚Äì1943). Their marriage dissolved in 1917. He died in Paris in 1926, after having fallen down a steep staircase. Career Ludvig Karsten ‚Äì The Blue Kitchen Karsten grew up in a wealthy home in Christiania (now Oslo). He started taking drawing lessons 13 years old. In 1893 he made a study tour to Telemark, where he made landscape sketches and portraits, and also joined painter Halfdan Egedius. After graduating from secondary school in 1895, he travelled to Rome, and later to Firenze and Munich. In 1896 he travelled in Spain, and settled for a while in Madrid. He left Spain in 1898, and was enrolled in the Norwegian Armed Forces at Gardermoen for some months. He then travelled to Munich, where he painted En mann og en kvinne, also called Adam and Eve, which has later been located at the Stenersen Museum. He visited Paris in autumn 1900, where he trained on models. In 1901 he was in √Ösg√•rdstrand, where he painted Two Men and Three Boys, which were both shown at his first appearance at the Autumn exhibition in Kristiania in 1901.Messel 1995: pp. 7‚Äì31 Karsten returned to Paris, where he spent several years. He was known for his boozing and temperament. After a fight with the poet Nils Collett Vogt he was temporarily expelled from the circle of Norwegian artists residing in Paris. He visited the museum Louvre, where he paraphrased Riberas painting of the burial of Christ. The painting was bought by Frits Thaulow, and came to be Karsten's the first important sale. It was resold to the National Gallery in Oslo in 1909, after Thaulow's death.Messel 1995: pp. 31‚Äì39 Karsten's first separate exhibition, at Blomqvist in Kristiania in September and October 1904, received mixed critic in the newspapers.Messel 1995: pp. 40‚Äì41 In 1905 he visited Edvard Munch at √Ösg√•rdstrand, where Munch made a large portrait of him. After a night of heavy drinking, possibly on Midsummer Eve, it came to quarrel which led to a violent fight between Munch and Karsten. Munch later made an etching of his version of the incident.Messel 1995: pp. 43‚Äì46 From 1910 Karsten lived mostly in Copenhagen, where he married in 1913. In 1920, he bought a house in Skagen where he began painting large landscapes in his pointill√© style, attracted by the bright local light. Karsten is represented at the National Gallery of Norway with several paintings, including Kristi gravleggelse from 1904, V√•rkveld i Ula from 1905, T√¶ring from 1907, Det bl√• kj√∏kken () from 1913, Det r√∏de kj√∏kken () from 1913, and Flukten fra Egypt from 1922. He is represented at the Bergen Museum (with S√∏sken, and Batseba), at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm (with the painting Den lyse og m√∏rke akt), at Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen (with Golgata from 1923), and at the Stenersen Museum in Oslo (with the paintings Adam og Eva and Gobelin). Karsten was also well known for his paraphrases of works by elder painters, including 16th-century artist Jacopo Bassano and 17th-century artists Jusepe de Ribera and Rembrandt. His last painting was a portrait of his daughter Alise, when she visited him in Paris in 1926.Messel 1995, p. 197 Image:Ludvig Karsten Bl√• stol.jpg Bl√• stol (Blue chair) File:Ludvig Karsten St√•ende akt 1910.jpg Standing nude (1910) File:Ludvig Karsten Gobelin 1911.jpgGobelin 1911 File:Ludvig Karsten - Spring Evening at Ula - Google Art Project.jpgSpring Evening at Ula File:Ludvig Karsten Nedtagelsen 1925.jpg Deposition (1925) Image:Ludvig Karsten Hvitkledd mann i skagenlandskap 1924.jpg White-Suited Man in Skagen Landscape (1924) References =Bibliography= * * External links * *Karsten-maleri dukket opp etter Aftenposten-sak [Karsten painting surfaced after a newspaper article in Aftenposten] Category:1876 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Artists from Oslo Category:19th-century Norwegian painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century Norwegian painters Category:Norwegian male painters Category:Skagen Painters Category:Norwegian expatriates in Spain Category:Norwegian expatriates in France Category:Norwegian expatriates in Denmark Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Ludvig Karsten"},{"id":"28185267","title":"Let the Music Lift You Up"},{"id":"28185273","text":"The Villa Isola in Bandung, designed by Wolff Schoemaker. Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker (25 July 1882 ‚Äì 22 May 1949) was a Dutch architect who designed several distinguished Art Deco buildings in Bandung, Indonesia, including the Villa Isola and Hotel Preanger. He has been described as \\"the Frank Lloyd Wright of Indonesia,\\" and Wright had a considerable influence on Schoemaker's modernist designs. Although he was primarily known as an architect, he was also a painter and sculptor. Early life and formative years Wolff Schoemaker was born in , Indonesia on the island of Java, where he would spend most of his life. For his secondary school education, Schoemaker was sent to the KMA (Royal Military Academy) in the Dutch city of Breda.Cor Passchier:The quest for the ultimate architecture. Indonesia in the late colonial period, 2008. Retrieved 29 July 2010 In 1905, he returned to the Dutch East Indies to work for the Royal Dutch East Indies Army as a military engineer. After leaving the job in 1911, he became the engineer for the Department of Civil Public Works in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), and became the Director of Public Works in 1914. From 1917 to 1918, he worked for Fa. Schlieper & Co and took a study trip to the United States with the organization, where he came into contact with the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Career Hotel Preanger in Bandung In 1918, in partnership with his brother Richard, Schoemaker established the architectural firm C.P. Schoemaker and Associates in Bandung. His firm blended traditional Indonesian architecture with modern European styles, incorporating traditional elements into the shapes and layouts of the buildings. Wolff Schoemaker deliberately applied a functionalist approach to his buildings. Among his most notable buildings were the Soci√´teit Concordia building on Braga Street (1921), where the Asian‚ÄìAfrican Conference was held in 1955 (today known as Gedung Merdeka),Museum of the Asian-African Conference: Gedung Merdeka , 29 July 2010 the Hotel Preanger (1929), the Pasteur Institute of Indonesia, the St. Peter Cathedral, and Villa Isola (1932), all located in Bandung. His own house, built in 1930 in a northern residential neighbourhood of Bandung, epitomized his architectural vision. The building had been under threat of being demolished in 1995, only rescued after the intervention of the Bandung Society for Heritage Conservation. The adaptive reuse of the building, now converted into a bank, was carried out in 1996 with the help of local architects and students. The conservation of this local heritage has been awarded one of the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation in 2000.\\"UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation\\". Retrieved 29 July 2010 In 1922, he became the professor of the Technische Hoogeschool Bandoeng (Technical College of Bandung). While professor, he mentored Sukarno, who would become the first President of the Republic of Indonesia. With assistance from the young Sukarno, Wolff Schoemaker renovated the Hotel Preanger in 1929. Under Schoemaker's assistance, Sukarno also designed several houses in Bandung. One of Schoemaker's most significant works was the Villa Isola, built from 1932 to 1933 for the Dutch media tycoon Dominique William Berretty.Villa Isola, MuseumStuff.com. Schoemaker's design was influenced by indigenous Javanese philosophy; the orientation of the building is according to the north-south axis, where the building faces Mount Tangkuban Perahu to the north and the city of Bandung to the south. The building incorporates many circular shapes, such as a spiral staircase in the main lobby and an arch-shaped window in the family room.Villa Isola in Bandung by Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker , Best House Design, 17 November 2008.

It is sometimes considered a subspecies of Setaria italica. It is native to Eurasia, but it is known on most continents as an introduced species and is closely related to Setaria faberi, a noxious weed. It is a hardy grass which grows in many types of urban, cultivated, and disturbed habitat, including vacant lots, sidewalks, railroads, lawns, and at the margins of fields. It is the wild antecedent of the crop foxtail millet. This is an annual grass with decumbent or erect stems growing up to a meter long, and known to reach two meters or more at times. The leaf blades are up to 40 centimeters long and 2.5 wide and glabrous. The inflorescence is a dense, compact, spikelike panicle up to 20 centimeters long, growing erect or sometimes nodding at the tip only. Spikelets are 1.8 ‚Äì 2.2 mm long. Each is subtended by up to three stiff bristles. Its fertile lemmas are finely cross-wrinkled. Setaria viridis is often confused with S. faberi, (Chinese or Giant Foxtail), which has sparse, soft hairs on the leaves and a nodding inflorescence. Setaria viridis is closely related to S. italica (Foxtail Millet), which has larger spikelets about 3 mm long and usually smooth, shiny upper lemmas. Foxtail Millet was cultivated in China by 2700 B.C. and during the Stone Age in Europe. Setaria viridis has been proposed as a model to study C4 photosynthesis and related bioenergy grasses. It has a short life cycle (6‚Äì8 weeks), is transformable and is currently being sequenced. Genetic resources are currently being developed by a number of groups. A method to break the prolonged seed dormancy has been discovered recently and all these could contribute towards making S. viridis a choice monocot genetic model system.

It is an active Church of England parish church and part of the Wakefield deanery in the archdeaconry of Pontefract, diocese of Wakefield and commonly known as St Peter's. It is on the site of a Norman church built in about 1100, and probably an Anglo-Saxon church before that. The present church, by local architect John Carr, was completed in 1794. It is a prominent local landmark and has been designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. History Horbury was a chapelry of All Saints Church in Wakefield and has probably had a chapel since before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Earl Warenne, Lord of the Manor of Wakefield built a church in the Norman style in 1106. It had a tower, nave and small chancel. In 1509 William Amyas of Horbury Hall left money to the \\"belles of Horbury Church\\". The \\"Devil's Knell\\" was tolled after midnight on Christmas morning, the tenor bell tolled for an hour, then four fours were struck followed by a strike for every year since the birth of Christ. This tradition was discontinued but survives in Dewsbury. The parish registers record the burial of two soldiers following the Battle of Wakefield. In the late 1780s John Carr, son of a Horbury stonemason and former Lord Mayor of York, offered to build a new church at his own expense. It cost ¬£8,000 (}), plus a further ¬£2,000 for the bells and organ (}). The foundation stone for the new church was laid in 1790 and it was opened in 1794. The vestry was built in 1884. The rotunda and spire were rebuilt 1899, when more bells were added. A south chapel commemorating the First World War was added in 1920. A mission church, now St John's Horbury Bridge, was started in a room in what is now the Post Office in 1864. The curate, Sabine Baring-Gould wrote the hymn \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" in 1865 for the Whitsun procession to Horbury Church. Another mission was set up at Horbury Junction in 1887 and replaced by St Mary's Church in 1893. =Present day= The parish stands in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As it rejects the ordination of women, the parish receives Alternative Episcopal Oversight from the Bishop of Wakefield (currently Tony Robinson). Structure The church is built in local ashlar sandstone with a grey slate roof in the Classical style. =Exterior= Drawing of Horbury Church from 1791 The church has a square west tower in four reducing stages surmounted by a colonnaded rotunda with a small fluted, conical spire. The first stage is constructed of smooth ashlar stone with round-arched and square blind windows. The second stage is rusticated with a clock to the four faces. A round-arched bell-chamber is on the third stage and the fourth stage is similar with columns. The five-bay nave has octagonal ends and three-bay north and south wings. The nave has tall, round-arched windows. The south wing has four Ionic columns supporting a pediment in the form of a portico over a central double-door which also has a pediment. There are round-arched windows at ground-floor level and square windows above. The north wing is plain with central entrance with an architrave and pediment. The vestry is to the north-east and has a round- arched entrance and door flanked by tapering pilasters supporting a frieze and cornice. There is a chapel to south-east. The pediment is inscribed: HANC AEDEM SACRAH PIETATIS IN DEUM ET AMORIS IN SOLUM NATALE MONIMENTUM PROPRIIS SUMPTIBUS EXTRUXIT JOANNES CARR ARCHITECTUS ANNO CHRISTI MDCCXC1 GLORIA DEO IN EXCELSIS =Interior= Inside, the bay divisions are marked by fluted Corinthian pilasters. A west gallery with a panelled front containing the organ is supported by Tuscan columns. The shallow vaulted ceiling has an elaborate frieze terminating in shallow segmental coving. =Fixtures and fittings= The tower contains eight bells, five cast in 1792 by Thomas Mears, and three in 1899 by Mears & Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The church is furnished with straight-backed panelled pews with rounded ends. The communion rail is made from green/brown marble. An octagonal panelled pulpit dated 1917 was given in memory of Richard and Martha Ann Popplewell. There are memorials to John Carr and his family in the chancel.

It had an estimated magnitude of about 8, a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and triggered a major tsunami that caused severe damage and loss of life on Crete and at Alexandria. Tectonic setting The Hellenic arc, the most likely location for this earthquake, is an arcuate tectonic feature related to the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Aegean Sea Plate. It is one of the most active seismic zones in western Eurasia and has a history of large earthquakes that also affect Egypt. Damage The earthquake and the tsunami are recorded as having a devastating impact on Heraklion, Crete. Detailed information is available from reports made by representatives from Heraklion (then Candia) to the controlling Venetian administration, written on the day of the earthquake and twenty days later. They describe the extent of damage to the main public buildings of Candia and castles over the whole island. The reports also mention that most of the victims were women and children, without giving numbers. There was also massive flooding at Alexandria. Many ships were destroyed, some of them carried up to inland. The port city of Acre, on the Levantine coast, was also affected; buildings were destroyed and people swept to their deaths. In Egypt the earthquake caused severe damage in Cairo, dislodging much of the Great Pyramid's white limestone casing and toppling minarets on many mosques. In Alexandria the city walls were mostly destroyed and the lighthouse was badly damaged. Characteristics =Earthquake= Although the precise location of the epicenter is uncertain, it is generally agreed that the earthquake ruptured the eastern segment of the Hellenic arc somewhere between Crete and Rhodes. The earthquake caused damage over a wide area including Crete, the Peloponnese, Rhodes, Cairo, Acre, Damascus, Antioch, and Cyprus and was felt as far away as Constantinople () and possibly Tunis (). The exact magnitude is unknown but is estimated to have been about 8.0. =Tsunami= Modelling of the tsunami predicts a maximum 9 m run-up at Alexandria, with about a 40-minute delay from the time of the earthquake to the arrival of the first wave in Egypt.

Woodstock West is the name University of Denver students gave to the shanty village that they built while protesting the school's decision to stay open after the Kent State shootings. History On May 4, 1970, 1,500 students gathered on the University of Denver campus to publicly mourn their fallen comrades at Kent State and attempted to make sense of President Nixon‚Äôs invasion of Cambodia, a clear sign of extending rather than ending the contentious Vietnam War. Shouts of ‚ÄúBurn! Burn! Burn!‚Äù tumbled through the student body like a Rocky Mountain spring avalanche. Somehow, a lone voice broke through, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build, not burn.‚Äù Thus was born the idea for Woodstock West, an intentionally peaceful response to the violence engulfing campuses from New York to Seattle. Students pitched tents and built makeshift shelters on a grassy area known as the Carnegie Green. There they debated, performed, sang, talked and tried to make sense of their sorrow and anger. The spirit of those first few days replicated the peace and freedom of its namesake, the 1969 music extravaganza Woodstock. The encampment was eventually razed on May 13, after the university called in the Colorado National Guard. Background Two critical events that helped to set the stage for Woodstock West were President Nixon's position on the Vietnam War, and the shooting of student protesters at Kent State. Nixon had campaigned in 1968 that he would end U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Among other platform statements that detailed an end to the war, the Republicans wrote in 1968, ‚ÄúWe must urgently dedicate our efforts toward restoration of peace both at home and abroad.‚Äù His narrow victory over Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Independent George WallaceIn the popular vote Nixon nudged Humphrey 43.42% to 42.72% illustrated, in part, the voters‚Äô support of this platform imperative. On April 30, 1970, however, the president came clean about a 14-month bombing campaign in Cambodia. This signaled to many he had broken his campaign promise and had, instead, escalated the war he promised to end. This set off the second critical event that provided impetus for Woodstock West. In response to Nixon's announcement, campuses erupted into protests, strikes, and violence. Perhaps the most well-known incident of this time happened at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. The governor called the National Guard into Kent after various violent incidents occurred in town and on campus. A Monday morning anti-war rally ended with Guardsmen killing four students, wounding nine others and leaving a nation in shock.

The line concerned was constructed and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway, known as the International Railway of Maine. It crossed the state and provided a shortcut between the Canadian cities of Montreal and Saint John, New Brunswick. On the morning of December 20, 1919, Train No. 39, an eleven-car immigrant special bound for Montreal, was moving west in four sections. Third 39 carried steerage passengers from the liner Empress of France, which had docked in Saint John the previous day, carrying a few Canadian soldiers and 300 immigrants, mostly English and Scottish. By the time Third 39 departed Brownville Junction at 6:25 a.m., it was running over five hours late. Freight train No.78 had departed Megantic at 6 p.m. the previous evening. It consisted of 26 cars and had been waiting on a siding at Moosehead, where it had allowed the first two sections of No.39 to pass. It had received orders that it was five hours ahead of Third 39, giving it plenty of time to reach Morkill. It left Greenville at 6:40 a.m. and arrived in a siding at Morkill at 6:57 a.m. At Morkill further orders were received to the effect that Third 39 was late, and Fourth 39 was eight hours late. This order was misread and the freight train mistakenly believed that Third 39 was now running eight hours late, giving them time to reach Brownville Junction before the end of their 16-hour shift. At 7:14 a.m., as dawn approached, the trains collided head-on just west of Onawa station on a curve beside Little Greenwood Pond at a combined speed of 50 mph. The baggage car next to the engine was 'entirely demolished'. The next passenger car telescoped the one behind it for two-thirds of its length. The wreckage then caught fire, adding to the horror. Seventeen people were killed outright, including six children, the enginemen and firemen of both trains, and six more dying after being freed from the wreckage. Fifty people were injured, some severely, and were taken by special train to hospitals in Brownville Junction and Bangor.

First signed in 1962, it is aimed at maintaining exporting countries' quotas and keeping coffee prices high and stable in the market, mainly using export quotas to steer the price. The International Coffee Organization, the controlling body of the agreement, represents all major coffee producing countries and most consuming countries. The current 2007 agreement has 42 exporting members and 7 importing (the European Union represents all its member states as one member). History The original agreement was signed in 1962 for a five-year period, and since then there have been six subsequent agreements, ratified in 1968, 1976, 1983, 1994, 2001 and 2007. =Background= The precursor to the ICA was the Inter-American Coffee Agreement (IACA) established during the Second World War. The war had created the conditions for a Latin American coffee agreement: European markets were closed off, the price of coffee was in decline and the United States feared that the declining price could drive Latin American countries‚Äîespecially Brazil‚Äîtowards Nazi or Communist sympathies. In 1940, the United States agreed to restrict its imports to a quota of 15.9 million bags, and other Latin American countries agreed to restrict their production. The agreement had an immediate effect, the price almost doubled by the end of 1941. After the end of the war in 1945 the price of coffee rose continuously until 1955‚Äì57 when a degree of equilibrium was reached. Producers sought ways to maintain the price, this led to the first International Coffee Agreement. A target price was set, and export quotas allocated to each producer. When the indicator price set by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) fell below the target price, quotas were decreased; if it rose above it, quotas were increased. Although the system had its problems, it was successful in raising and stabilizing the price. The International Coffee Organization was established in 1963 to administer the clauses of the agreement and supervise the mechanisms in place. Until 1986 the Coffee Council, the decision-making body of ICO, approved export quotas. =Breakdown of the 1989 agreement= In 1989, ICO failed to reach an agreement on new export quotas, causing the 1983 ICA to break down. The disagreement was triggered by consumers' change in taste towards milder and higher quality coffee. With the retained quotas from the 1983 agreement, the change increased the value of milder coffee at the expense of more traditional varieties such as robusta. Brazil in particular ‚Äì the world's most powerful coffee producer ‚Äì refused to reduce its quotas believing it would lower their market share. The consumers, led by the United States, demanded higher quality coffee and the end of selling coffee to non-members at reduced rates. The US criticized Brazil for not being willing to accept a reduction of the country's quotas despite falling share of the world market since 1980. Jorio Dauster, head of the state-controlled Brazilian Coffee Institute, described Brazil as an \\"extremely efficient producer\\" and believed it could survive without help from ICO. The 1983 ICA was set to expire on 1 October 1989, but realizing that it would be impossible to enter into a new agreement before the termination date, the Coffee Council (ICO's highest body) effectively decided to suspend the export quotas on 4 July 1989. Without an extended agreement producing countries lost most of their influence on the international market. ICO's average indicator price for the last five years previous the end of the regime fell from US$1.34 per pound, to US$0.77 per pound for the first five years after. According to Yves Engler's Canada in Africa, \\"no longer worried about the prospect of poor coffee producers turning towards the Soviet Union, the US withdrew its support from the International Coffee Agreement in 1989.\\" Members The current 2007 ICA entered into force on 2 February 2011 when it was approved by two-thirds of the exporting and importing signatory governments. , it has 51 members, of which 44 are exporting members, and 7 importing (the European Union represents all its 28 member states). According to ICO, its members represent 98% of all coffee production and 67% of the consumption. ;Exporting members (42) *Angola *Benin *BoliviaProvisional application *Brazil *Burundi *Cameroon *Central African Republic *Colombia *Costa Rica *Ivory Coast *Cuba *Ecuador *El Salvador *Ethiopia *Gabon *Ghana *Guatemala *Guinea *Haiti *Honduras *India *Indonesia *Jamaica *Kenya *Liberia *Malawi *Mexico *Nicaragua *Panama *Papua New Guinea *Paraguay *Philippines *Rwanda *Sierra Leone *Tanzania *Thailand *East Timor *Togo *Uganda *Vietnam *Yemen *Zambia *Zimbabwe ;Importing members (7) *Japan *Norway *Russian Federation *Switzerland *Tunisia *United States of America *European Union: **Austria **Belgium **Bulgaria **Croatia **Cyprus **Czech Republic **Denmark **Estonia **Finland **France **Germany **Greece *Hungary *Ireland *Italy *Latvia *Lithuania *Luxembourg *Malta *Netherlands *Poland *Portugal *Romania *Slovakia *Slovenia *Spain *Sweden *United Kingdom United States Exits The United States exited the International Coffee Agreement after a 90-day notification period ending 27 June 2018.http://www.ico.org/documents/international%20coffee%20agreements/membership- icas.pdf See also Notes References  External links * Membership Category:Commercial treaties International Coffee Agreement Category:United Nations treaties Category:Treaties concluded in 1962 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1962 Category:Treaties of Angola Category:Treaties of Bolivia Category:Treaties of Brazil Category:Treaties of Burundi Category:Treaties of Cameroon Category:Treaties of the Central African Republic Category:Treaties of Colombia Category:Treaties of Costa Rica Category:Treaties of Ivory Coast Category:Treaties of Cuba Category:Treaties of Ecuador Category:Treaties of El Salvador Category:Treaties of Ethiopia Category:Treaties of Gabon Category:Treaties of Ghana Category:Treaties of Guatemala Category:Treaties of Honduras Category:Treaties of India Category:Treaties of Indonesia Category:Treaties of Kenya Category:Treaties of Liberia Category:Treaties of Malawi Category:Treaties of Mexico Category:Treaties of Nicaragua Category:Treaties of Panama Category:Treaties of Papua New Guinea Category:Treaties of the Philippines Category:Treaties of Rwanda Category:Treaties of Sierra Leone Category:Treaties of Tanzania Category:Treaties of Thailand Category:Treaties of East Timor Category:Treaties of Togo Category:Treaties of Uganda Category:Treaties of Vietnam Category:Treaties of Yemen Category:Treaties of Zambia Category:Treaties of Zimbabwe Category:Treaties of Norway Category:Treaties of Switzerland Category:Treaties of Tunisia Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of the United States Category:Treaties entered into by the European Union Category:Treaties of Benin Category:Treaties of Guinea Category:Treaties of Haiti Category:Treaties of Paraguay Category:Food treaties ","title":"International Coffee Agreement"},{"id":"28185730","text":"Morgan Teressa Janai Stuart (born February 8, 1989) is an American-Filipino softball coach and former infielder.

The routing of the road provides access to several more lakes in rural Iron County such as Paint, Silk and Hehe lakes, as well as an older routing of US 2, before crossing into southern Houghton County. In Houghton County, FFH 16 and M-28 meet in the Duncan Township community of Kenton. The former roadway turns east and runs concurrently along the latter one for approximately a quarter mile (0.4 km) before turning northward again, leaving town near the cemetery. The forest highway tracks due north until Bob Lake. There the roadway meanders through the area near another National Forest campground and crosses into eastern Ontonagon County. FFH 16 crosses back into Houghton County one last time. Immediately after crossing the county line, the forest highway terminates at an intersection with M-38 west of the community of Nisula. History A new county-designated highway appeared on maps for the first time in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US 2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition of the map. The H-16 label reappeared in 1992; this time it was shown continuing south toward the Wisconsin state line and north to M-38, along the routing of FFH-16. The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The highway has never been included in the CDH system as Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties do not participate in the system, and the Upper Peninsula east of US 41 is the G zone, not the H zone.

The zoo lies in a natural, almost untouched birch forest. In the 30-hectare area of the zoo, the visitors find themselves in continents, so that one that enters can walk along them to observe how the animals live in certain parts of the world. The visitors can have some rest in Hotel Dzsungel (Hotel Jungle). History Ny√≠regyh√°za Zoo was opened in 1974 under the name ‚ÄúNy√≠regyh√°zi Vadaspark‚Äù (Wild Park of Ny√≠regyh√°za). It was given place 5 km from Ny√≠regyh√°za in the S√≥st√≥ recreation area in a 14-hectare birch forest. It is owned and sponsored by the local government of S√≥st√≥-Ny√≠regyh√°za, therefore the park's other name ‚ÄúS√≥st√≥ Zoo‚Äù is still in use. At the time of its opening, its main purpose was to exhibit the species of Hungary and the Pannonian Basin. It has a unique exhibition system in which the giant exhibits are separated from the paths with ditches filled with water. Some European species were replaced with their close relatives, such as there are American bisons exhibited instead of those found in Europe. The greatest spectacles of that time were the European carnivores, the bears, and the timber wolves substituting their European relatives. But as usual, the number of visitors decreased due to the lack of exotic animals. The year 1996 brought a breakthrough to the zoo. This year, the new director L√°szl√≥ Gajdos took up his duties in the park and decided to create a real zoo in Ny√≠regyh√°za. J√°nos Sz√°nth√≥ received the rank of deputy manager. As life was not easy those days, Sz√°nth√≥ personally brought up a number of smaller animals. In this year, the redenomination of the zoo has occurred. It received a new name ‚ÄúNy√≠regyh√°zi √Ållatpark‚Äù (however, some may still call it by its older name, Vadaspark, incorrectly). L√°szl√≥ Gajdos and his team has since come up with new ideas every year. The √Ållatpark is the richest zoo in mammals (especially primates and pachyderms) in Hungary. The once 14 hectare area is now 32 hectares large and instead of the former couple of dozens of animals today the specimens of approximately 320 species can be seen by the visitors. It has grown out to be the biggest animal collection in the country. The zoo is member of the Hungarian Association of Zoos (M√ÅSZ), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). A short summary what have happened since 1996: *1996: 1996 was the year of African species. The exhibit of lions was finished and the biggest exhibit of the country was opened with the name Afrika Panor√°ma (Africa Panorama), where zebras, ostriches, common elands, and wildebeests are cohabited. The aviary was also completed this year, which gives places to the richest parrot and cockatoo collection in Hungary. The exhibit for the tiger also opened this year. *1997: The expansion of the zoo was continued. The llama and the kangaroo exhibit opened for the public and the constructions on the giraffe shelter finished. The giraffe couple coming from the zoo of Emmen of the Netherlands gave birth to a baby in the same year. *1998: More and more species are given place in the zoo, some of them are real curiosity. Uniquely in Hungary, the parrots lay eggs throughout the year, and a number of scarce antelope calves are given birth (including waterbucks and black wildebeests). New species arrived to the zoo, the most interesting of which include skunks and red kangaroos coming from Budapest. *1999: The zoo became the first provincial zoo to provide a seal exhibit, where the visitors can inspect the swim of calves as well. The constructions of the rhinoceros shelter started this year too. *2000: The first saltwater aquarium in the countryside opened in 2000 in Hungary. Its most important animal among many others is a requiem shark. *2001: The exhibit and aviary for European animals was rebuilt and was denominated as Magyar ≈êspark (Hungarian Primeval Park). Besides the animals, a little open-air museum was given a place. The most interesting novelty is the long-desired European bison. *2002: The opening of the Tropical House occurred. A portion of sharks and monkeys were moved to the newly built house, of course the collection was completed with new species. The most precious inhabitants of the building are the Bornean orangutans. The open-air portion of the house was also opened in the same year which gives place to the Monkey Forest and the Mediterranean Garden. *2003: Around the former seal exhibit, Polar panorama was built. Penguins and polar bears are exhibited for the first time in provincial Hungary. *2004: The educational hall is built, which has since been closed. The wax museum presenting the evolution of humankind also opened that year. The sensation of the year is the arrival of the white tiger. *2005: Finally the first pachyderm, a young male white rhinoceros arrived. The Siberian tigers and the Kamchatka brown bears got a larger exhibit. *2006: The year of pachyderms. The new lion exhibit was built and the pygmy hippopotamus and elephant houses were finished. Two white rhinoceros and one pygmy hippo cows arrived along with three African elephants and two Indian rhinos. The constructions of Hungary's first in-zoo hotel's, Hotel Dzsungel (Hotel Jungle) also finished in the same year. *2007: An exhibit was built for the zoo's California sea lions. The birth of the first Hungarian-born African elephant calf, named Jumanee, occurred this year. *2008: The South America House (D√©l- Amerika H√°z) opened for the public. Its most precious inhabitant is Pedro, the tapir. Moreover, dromedaries, moose, and Gr√©vy's zebras were introduced. *2009: New spectacled and sun bears arrived together with three Indian elephants and the white lion. The construction of a great project started in 2009. The Green Pyramid (Z√∂ld Piramis) which now introduces visitors into the mysterious world of Asia. As another part of the same project, Tarzan's path was opened which provides its visitors an African adventure. The constructions of the Indonesian Ocenarium and Rainforest House began in 2009 too. *2010: The whole project of year 2009 opened for the public in 2010. Komodo dragons, pufferfish, triggerfish, a number of sharks (reef sharks, grey nurse sharks also known as sand tiger sharks), a 6 party orangutan family and a siamang arrived. Marmosets (now there are 18), the first Cameroon goat kids, a dromedary, and tortoises were given birth during the year.

Use of the last released edition from October 2013 continues for in-system programming of legacy hardware designs containing older FPGAs and CPLDs otherwise orphaned by the replacement design tool, Vivado Design Suite. ISE enables the developer to synthesize (\\"compile\\") their designs, perform timing analysis, examine RTL diagrams, simulate a design's reaction to different stimuli, and configure the target device with the programmer. Other components shipped with the Xilinx ISE include the Embedded Development Kit (EDK), a Software Development Kit (SDK) and ChipScope Pro.Embedded Systems Design with Platform FPGAs, Morgan Kaufmann, 10-Sep-2010 The Xilinx ISE is primarily used for circuit synthesis and design, while ISIM or the ModelSim logic simulator is used for system-level testing. Circuit Design with VHDL, MIT Press, 2004Advances in Computer Science and Information Engineering, Springer Science & Business Media, 11-May-2012 As commonly practiced in the commercial electronic design automation sector, Xilinx ISE is tightly-coupled to the architecture of Xilinx's own chips (the internals of which are highly proprietary) and cannot be used with FPGA products from other vendors. Given the highly proprietary nature of the Xilinx hardware product lines, it is rarely possible to use open source alternatives to tooling provided directly from Xilinx, although as of 2020, some exploratory attempts are being made. Legacy status Since 2012, Xilinx ISE has been discontinued in favor of Vivado Design Suite that serves the same roles as ISE with additional features for system on a chip development.Vivado Design Suite, First version released in 2012, Xilinx Downloads Xilinx released the last version of ISE in October 2013 (version 14.7), and states that \\"ISE has moved into the sustaining phase of its product life cycle, and there are no more planned ISE releases.\\"ISE 14.7 Updates, Xilinx Downloads User Interface The primary user interface of the ISE is the Project Navigator, which includes the design hierarchy (Sources), a source code editor (Workplace), an output console (Transcript), and a processes tree (Processes).FPGA Prototyping By Verilog Examples, John Wiley & Sons, 20-Sep-2011 The Design hierarchy consists of design files (modules), whose dependencies are interpreted by the ISE and displayed as a tree structure. For single-chip designs there may be one main module, with other modules included by the main module, similar to the \`main()\` subroutine in C++ programs. Design constraints are specified in modules, which include pin configuration and mapping. The Processes hierarchy describes the operations that the ISE will perform on the currently active module. The hierarchy includes compilation functions, their dependency functions, and other utilities. The window also denotes issues or errors that arise with each function. The Transcript window provides status of currently running operations, and informs engineers on design issues. Such issues may be filtered to show Warnings, Errors, or both. Simulation System-level testing may be performed with ISIM or the ModelSim logic simulator, and such test programs must also be written in HDL languages. Test bench programs may include simulated input signal waveforms, or monitors which observe and verify the outputs of the device under test. ModelSim or ISIM may be used to perform the following types of simulations: *Logical verification, to ensure the module produces expected results *Behavioural verification, to verify logical and timing issues *Post-place & route simulation, to verify behaviour after placement of the module within the reconfigurable logic of the FPGA Synthesis Xilinx's patented algorithms for synthesis allow designs to run up to 30% faster than competing programs, and allows greater logic density which reduces project time and costs.The Digital Consumer Technology Handbook, Elsevier, 30-Apr-2004 Also, due to the increasing complexity of FPGA fabric, including memory blocks and I/O blocks, more complex synthesis algorithms were developed that separate unrelated modules into slices, reducing post-placement errors. IP Cores are offered by Xilinx and other third-party vendors, to implement system-level functions such as digital signal processing (DSP), bus interfaces, networking protocols, image processing, embedded processors, and peripherals. Xilinx has been instrumental in shifting designs from ASIC-based implementation to FPGA-based implementation. Editions The Subscription Edition is the licensed version of Xilinx ISE, and a free trial version is available for download. The Web Edition is the free version of Xilinx ISE, that can be downloaded and used for no charge. It provides synthesis and programming for a limited number of Xilinx devices. In particular, devices with a large number of I/O pins and large gate matrices are disabled. The low- cost Spartan family of FPGAs is fully supported by this edition, as well as the family of CPLDs, meaning small developers and educational institutions have no overheads from the cost of development software. License registration is required to use the Web Edition of Xilinx ISE, which is free and can be renewed an unlimited number of times. Device Support = Hardware Support = ISE supports Xilinx's 7-series (except of Spartan-7) and older devices including CPLDs (XC9500 and CoolRunner). For development targeting newer Xilinx's devices (UltraScale and UltraScale+ series), the Xilinx Vivado has to be used. = Operating System Support = Xilinx officially supports Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise 4, 5, & 6 Workstations (32 & 64 bits) and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 (32 & 64 bits).

Biography Arthur von Briesen was born in Metz, in Alsace-Lorraine, at the time part of the German Empire. He began his military career on 24 March 1909 as a cadet (F√§hnrich) in the 52nd Artillery Regiment. Then, in 1913, he was commissioned as an acting lieutenant into the 18th Ulanen-Regiment. In August 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, Briesen was permanently transferred to the 18th Ulanen-Regiment, where he remained until 1916. Promoted to the substantive rank of Lieutenant in May 1916, Briesen was appointed aide-de-camp in different staffs, including in the High Command from 1917 to September 1919. During the war, he was awarded the prestigious Iron Cross (first class). In September 1919, Briesen was transferred to the police, where he stayed until 1 October 1934, when he rejoined the regular army with the rank of Commander (Major). He was assigned to the Rostock Infantry Regiment until October 1935, then commanded the 3rd Battalion the 27th Infantry Regiment from October 1935 to November 1938, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Promoted to the rank of Colonel on 1 April 1938, Briesen was assigned to the Staff of the 27th Infantry Regiment, until May 1939. In 1939, following the completion of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March, Briesen was appointed to command the city of Prague, where he remained for five years. He was rewarded with the Iron Cross in 1939. On 1 October 1942, Briesen was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor and in March 1944 was appointed commander of Brody in the Ukraine. In May 1944 he was assigned to the headquarters of the Wehrmacht in Italy, to be retrained. From July to November 1944, Briesen was assigned to the headquarters of the troops stationed in Bohemia and Moravia. He was taken prisoner on 8 May 1945, when German forces across Europe surrendered unconditionally, and was not released until some two years later. Arthur von Briesen died in 1981, near Konstanz.

In 1560 local authorities formally requested the president of the Audiencia of Lima for the creation of an audiencia for Chile. It was argued that it would serve to control the actions of the governors of Chile, improve royal treasury's collection of revenue and hasten the end of the Arauco War. In 1565 King Phillip II ordered the creation of a Chilean audiencia in his decree of May 18. The audiencia had four oidores, one of them serving as president; a fiscal or public prosecutor; and the related subordinate officials, such as an alguacil mayor (greater bailiff) and his lieutenants, notaries public, an interpreter, a chaplain and a doorman. In cases when the office of the governor of Chile went vacant, the oidores of the Audiencia were to assume administration of the government. Due to various problems in its operation, the Audiencia was dissolved less than a decade later by the royal decree of August 26, 1573, which took effect on June 25, 1575, a month after it received notification of the decree. After it was dissolved the judicial functions of the Audiencia were entrusted to the lieutenant governor and capit√°n general of Chile.

He was moderator of the syndicated television series All About TV from 1969 to 1990. In 2002, he hosted and produced a 13-program series for public television, Television in America: An Autobiography. Life Scheuer was born in New York City in 1926. His brothers (all deceased) were 13-Term New York Congressman James H. Scheuer, Walter Scheuer, an investor and film producer, and Richard Scheuer, a scholar and philanthropist. He also has a sister, Amy Scheuer Cohen. His wife was author and feminist social critic Alida Brill. Scheuer died on May 31, 2014, in New York of congestive heart failure. The Movies on TV series Movies on TV was the first guide of its kind, preceding Leonard Maltin's similarly titled TV Movies book series (later rebranded Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide) by ten years.
