WS Foka () was a family of Polish air-cooled V-engines of the late 1930s. The Foka A was an 8-cylinder engine initially designed by Stanis≈Çaw Nowku≈Ñski for the modern P.Z.L. P.38 Wilk fighter-bomber and P.Z.L. P.39 fighter, it was to start a family of high-performance engines for other types of Polish warplanes as well.Glass, pp. 10-11 The initial series was to achieve roughly of power and eventually reach . However, following the designer's death in 1936, the development met a number of serious setbacks. Taken over by a new team of designers, the basic problems with vibrations, overheating and high fuel consumption.Pawe≈Ç, ¬∂ \\"JakƒÖ masƒô przyjƒÖƒá do oblicze≈Ñ?\\" By the time one of the early prototypes was installed in the second prototype of P.Z.L. P.38 Wilk, the engine provided only around . As P.Z.L. P.38 also had other serious issues, both projects were eventually cancelled after only 8 prototypes had been completed. The successor to Foka A was Foka B, a V-12 engine intended as the powertrain of P.Z.L. P.48 Lampart, P.Z.L. P.45 Sok√≥≈Ç, RWD 25, P.W.S.41 and L.W.S.3 Mewa. However, the outbreak of World War II prevented the first prototype from being completed. Design and development In late 1934 the Aeronautics Department of the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs ordered the development of a high-power engine at the Polskie Zak≈Çady ≈†koda company. The engine was to become the powerplant of P.Z.L. 38 and P.Z.L. 39 fighters, under development at the time, as well as other modern designs. The lead designer became Stanis≈Çaw Nowku≈Ñski. Earlier the same year Nowku≈Ñski created the GR-760 high-efficiency air-cooled radial engine. Used in a number of sports planes (notably the RWD 9), the engine won the Challenge International de Tourisme 1934 and a number of other tournaments. When tasked with designing a larger, more powerful engine for warplanes, Nowku≈Ñski decided to study the Farman 12bis and Ranger V-770 V engines. His new design, the Foka (Polish for seal) drew from both Nowku≈Ñski's earlier designs and the promising French and American constructions of the epoch. Similar to Ranger V-770, Foka had only 8 cylinders in an inverted-V configuration and also featured a reduction drive and mechanical supercharger allowing for up to at 4000 revolutions. Work on the new engine started in October 1934. The design team included Jerzy Be≈Çkowski, Kazimierz Ksiƒôski, Jan Oderfeld, Jaros≈Çaw Naleszkiewicz and Edward Kotarski. In early 1935 the Polskie Zak≈Çady ≈†koda works were taken over by the state and joined with other state-owned aviation manufacturers to form the State Aviation Works. Hence the new engine received the official name of P.Z.L. Foka. By early 1936 the basic design was ready. However, on 31 July 1936 Stanis≈Çaw Nowku≈Ñski was killed in an accident while hiking in the Tatra Mountains. Jan Oderfeld took over as head of the design team and two months later the construction of the first prototype series started. Initially eight engines were manufactured. When one was being worked on at a test bench, additional seven were being modified or prepared for a new series of tests. The first engines were much lighter than had been anticipated: only . However, their initial power output did not exceed . A series of tests and modifications to air inlets allowed for the power output to exceed in early 1937. However, the modifications also enlarged the engine. As numerous teething problems plagued the engine and the lead designer died in mountain accident, already in late 1936 Oderfeld informed the ministry that the problems would not be overcome fast enough for the Foka to achieve production readiness soon enough. While the second prototype of P.Z.L. P.38 Wilk was equipped with prototype P.Z.L. WS Foka engines and exhibited at the 1938 Paris Air Show, the engine was far from production readiness. The military insisted on ordering at least 400 engines as soon as possible, while Jerzy Oderfeld insisted that all the problems have to be solved before production starts. Because of that in early 1938 the project was sidetracked and the military decided to seek other engines in France instead (Gnome-Rh√¥ne and Hispano-Suiza). Many engineers were directed towards other construction teams and work on P.Z.L. Foka slowed down significantly. It was decided that limited development should continue on P.Z.L. Foka to facilitate the design of its successor, the P.Z.L. Foka B, a 12-cylinder inverted V engine that was to achieve at 5000 metres above sea level. Only the most successful elements of Foka A were to be used in the new engine (such as the pistons and valves), while the rest of Foka B was to be designed from scratch or seriously modified. Construction of the first prototype started in early 1939 and it was to be tested in 1940 before reaching production readiness in 1942. It was intended as a replacement of the Gnome-Rh√¥ne Mars engine in the role of the powertrain of more modern warplane designs, including P.Z.L. P.48 Lampart, P.Z.L. P.45 Sok√≥≈Ç, RWD 25, P.W.S.41 and L.W.S.3 Mewa. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 interrupted the construction.

Tang elites in northern China were familiar with Turkic culture, a factor that contributed to the Tang acceptance of Turkic recruits. The Tang emperor Taizong adopted the title of \\"Heavenly Kaghan\\" and promoted a cosmopolitan empire. Turkic soldiers that served under the Tang dynasty originated from the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. It began with Tang dynasty Emperor Taizong who sent his general Li Jing, eventually ended in defeating the Eastern Turks and capturing their leader Jiali Khan.New Book of Tang, vol. 93 . Taizong regularly recruited and promoted military officers of Turkic ancestry, whose steppe experience contributed to the western and northern expansion of the Tang empire. The Turkic general Ashina She'er participated in the Tang capture of the Karakhoja, Karasahr, and Kucha kingdoms in Xinjiang. The half-Turkic general An Lushan started a revolt that led to the decline of Tang Dynasty. The Orkhon inscriptions by the Gokturks were critical of the Turks that had served the Tang Dynasty, and condemned them for helping the Chinese emperor expand his burgeoning empire. The Turkic soldiers stationed by the Chinese in the Tang garrisons of Central Asia settled in the region, spreading Turkic languages in an area that had been predominantly Indo-European. Background The empire of the Tang Dynasty was more cosmopolitan and diverse than the earlier Han Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty elites of northern China had an interest in Turkic culture and intermingled with the people of the steppes. The setting of one Tang poem describes a yurt, and the performance of a Turkic actress was hosted in the emperor's palace Following the Tang Dynasty's defeat of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, the government authorized the settlement of Turks along the borders of the Tang empire. Turkic officers of the former khaganate were recruited as generals in the Tang military, and their experience with steppe warfare contributed to the Tang's military successes as it expanded westward. =Emperor Taizong and multiculturalism= Emperor Taizong adopted the steppe title of Heavenly Kaghan. Emperor Taizong, also known by his personal name Li Shimin, was familiar with the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horseman, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture. Taizong's adoption of the Heavenly Kaghan title was used to legitimize his role as a steppe khan not solely as a Chinese emperor with the title of Son of Heaven. He valued the kaghan title and was sincere about his role as a leader of Central Asia. He sought to solidify his claim as a kaghan by organizing a gathering of Turkic leaders in the Lingzhou fortress during the last years of his reign to reconfirm his title. While mostly symbolic, the title of Heavenly Kaghan shows Taizong's open attitudes towards the existence of a multicultural and ethnically diverse Tang empire. Taizong was proud of his policies promoting ethnic equality, and was reported to have said that, \\"The emperors since ancient times have all appreciated the Chinese and depreciated the barbarians. Only I view them as equal. That is why they look upon me as their parent.\\" He had a paternalistic attitude towards his subjects and believed that it was his duty to treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service. Tang relationship with the Turks may have further deepened had the crown prince Li Chengqian, a Turkophile, been enthroned as Taizong's successor. Li Chengqian enthusiastically embraced Turkic customs, and Chinese historian Sima Guang recorded that he: > \\"He [Chengqian] lved to emulate Turkish speech and their manner of dress. He > chose from among his retinue those who had Turkish features and grouped them > in bands of five; he made them plait their hair, wear sheepskins, and herd > sheep. He had made five wolf's head banners and tents and set up yurts. The > crown prince took up residence here; he gathered sheep and cooked them, and > then, drawing out his waist-knife, he would carve the meat and let everyone > eat.\\" Chengqian was deposed as crown prince by Taizong after his plans to usurp the throne were revealed. He was exiled by Taizong and died as a commoner. Turkic generals and Tang military campaigns Map of Tang campaigns against the Tarim Basin oasis states. The Turkic general Ashina She'er led the campaigns against Karasahr and Kucha. Camel with rider, earthenware, Tang Dynasty Turkic generals led many of the Tang Dynasty military campaigns that expanded the dynasty's territorial reach into Central Asia. In total, ten Turks were able to reach the highest military position of general. Ashina She'er, formerly the ruler of Beshbaliq and Kharakhoja between 630 and 635 and a member of the Ashina clan, was recruited as a Tang general in 635. He fought as a commander in a successful campaign against Karakhoja in 640. She'er was chosen as the general for the military expedition against Karasahr. The Tang loyalist that had been installed as ruler after the first invasion of Karasahr in 644 by Chinese general Guo Xiaoke was deposed by his cousin in a revolt. The usurper was executed after the rebellion was suppressed, and Tang governance returned to the oasis state. She'er continued onward to the nearby kingdom of Kucha, a state that had supported Karasahr during its war against the Tang. Emperor Taizong himself tended to the injuries of the Turkic Generals Qibi Heli and Ashina Simo, who were both wounded during the campaign against Goguryeo.Skaff 2012, p. 95. Ashina Zhong, the brother of She'er, also served as a Turkic general of the Tang Dynasty, and was a participant in a military performance hosted by Emperor Gaozong in 655. Another Turkic member of the Ashina clan, Ashina Helu, briefly served as a commander of the Tang army in Gansu before his rise as a kaghan of the Western Turkic Khaganate. During his reign, the Turkic tribes were unified under a single leader. Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor, dispatched a military expedition in 657 against Helu, who had been raiding Tang settlements. The campaign was led by the general Su Dingfang and the Turkic commanders Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, who were opposed to Helu. Helu was defeated and captured by the Tang forces, and the territories annexed from the Western Turks were placed under Tang governance through the Anxi Protectorate. Gaozong awarded the military service of the Turkic commanders Mishe and Buzhen by appointing them as proxy rulers of ten Western Turkic tribes. The ten tribes were split between the two cousins, and the western half was given to Buzhen while Mishe controlled the eastern tribes. In 685, the sons of Mishe and Buzhen were sent from the Tang capital of Chang'an, where they resided, to succeed their fathers in the west. Neither lasted long as Turkic rulers; one was overthrown by his tribal subjects and the other was deposed by the Second Turkic Khaganate after an invasion in 690. An Lushan was a Tang general of mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the majority of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with the politics of the imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed had it not been for their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years. The Orkhon inscriptions, a memorial erected by the Turks, lamented the Tang influence on the Turks and the Turkic adoption of Chinese titles: > \\"The Turkish people let their state.... go to ruin... their sons worthy of > becoming lords became slaves, and their daughters worthy of becoming ladies > became servants to the Chinese people. The Turkish lords abandoned their > Turkish titles. Those lords who were in China held the Chinese titles and > obeyed the Chinese emperor and gave their service to him for fifty years. > For the benefit of the Chinese, they went on campaigns up to [the land of] > the Bukli qaghan in the east, where the sun rises, and as far as the Iron > Gate in the West. For the benefit of the Chinese emperor they conquered > countries.\\" The inscriptions, made to commemorate the elites of the Second Turkic Empire, stress the importance of loyalty between a kaghan and the ruler's subjects. The Turks that sided with the Tang are condemned, and the disunity of the Turkic tribes is blamed on a lack of respect for the authority of the kaghan. Historical significance Tang Dynasty circa 700 AD. The Turkic soldiers and generals that worked in the Chinese garrisons of Central Asia spurred Turkic migration into the area. The Turkic language and culture of the Tang soldiers there gradually displaced the indigenous Indo-European languages. The native languages of Sogdian and Tokharian disappeared as the Turkic languages spread in the Tarim Basin. The Tang Dynasty declined after the An Shi Rebellion, and the dynasty eventually fell in 907. During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, an era of upheaval following the dynasty's collapse, many of the kingdoms in China were ruled by families of Turkic ancestry. The Shatuo Turks founded the Later Tang in 923, the Later Jin in 936, and the Later Han in 947. However, all the Turkic states in Northern China were short lived and were eventually conquered by the Song Dynasty.

He signed on the Endurance as an able seaman, and participated fully in the dangers and privations of the Weddell Sea, particularly after the Endurance sank and the ship's company and shore party were marooned on a nearby ice floe. Later, the ship's company and shore party were forced to take to lifeboats, and the seamanship of the ABs became a decisive element in the survival of the entire company. Expedition commander Ernest Shackleton was impressed by McCarthy's skill during the survival journey from the northern Weddell Sea to Elephant Island, and so when the expedition leader decided to relaunch the best lifeboat into the open Southern Ocean, with the goal of contacting potential rescuers in South Georgia, McCarthy was one of the five men he chose to accompany him. The sixteen-day voyage of the James Caird in April‚ÄìMay 1916 became a classic story of human endurance, and the boat's navigator, Frank Worsley, offered fervent and repeated praise to McCarthy for his services in keeping the boat afloat and helping to ensure the survival of the party. When the James Caird, in a sinking condition, made landfall on South Georgia's uncharted southern coast, two of the six men of the company were physically unfit for further service. Shackleton and his men turned over the boat and made it into a primitive shore shelter, which they called Peggotty Camp. Three of the men‚ÄîTom Crean, Worsley, and Shackleton himself‚Äîcrossed the icy island to finalise the rescue, while the other three, the ageing carpenter Henry McNish and incapacitated seaman John Vincent, briefly remained at the camp under McCarthy's informal leadership. The island crossing was successful and the party was reunited after less than forty-eight hours. Soon McCarthy found himself heading northward. Having successfully participated in his own rescue, his part in the expedition was over. Upon making landfall in the British Isles, McCarthy (who was not an Irish Nationalist and identified himself with the British Empire) found his country fighting World War I. He joined the Royal Navy Reserve as a leading seaman. In these duties he was assigned to man a deck gun on the S.S. Narragansett, an oil tanker. On 16 March 1917, this vessel was torpedoed and sunk with all hands in the Western Approaches. McCarthy, aged 28, was the first member of the Weddell Sea party of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition to die. Legacy The McCarthy brothers' memorial in Kinsale In 1916‚Äì17, McCarthy was awarded the Polar Medal in bronze. McCarthy Island, a rocky island just off King Haakon Bay where the James Caird made landfall, was named in McCarthy's honour by the South Georgia Survey in the period 1951‚Äì1957. A joint bust of Tim McCarthy and his brother Morty McCarthy, also an Antarctic explorer, was unveiled in Kinsale in September 2000.

Lawsuit In April 2013, Sweet Brown sued Apple for selling a song called \\"I Got Bronchitis\\" on iTunes for profit, using catchphrases uttered by her in the video, such as \\"Ain't nobody got time for that?\\", \\"Ran for my life,\\" and \\"Said oh, Lord Jesus, it's a fire!\\" Jimmy Kimmel parody In March 2014, variety show Jimmy Kimmel Live did a parody of the video in the style of a film trailer. The plot is Sweet Brown going through important moments in history and being responsible for things such as Barack Obama getting into politics and Steve Jobs founding Apple.

Biography During his childhood Parker's father, artist Robert Andrew Parker, attached wooden blocks to the hi-hat and bass drum pedals, so that Parker's feet could reach the pedals to play the drums along with records. His father, who was also a jazz drummer, introduced young Parker to the music of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Leadbelly, Ray Charles, Woody Herman, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. When he became a teenager he began practicing with friends and finding out the nostalgia of rock and roll by listening to such jazz drummers as Roger Hawkins, D. J. Fontana, and New Orleans icons such as Earl Palmer, Smokey Johnson and James Black. His enthusiasm grew as he went to New York City's School of Visual Arts to study painting, where he saw an ad for a drummer. He became a member of a band called Holy Moses when he moved to Woodstock, New York. That band was short lived during which Parker recorded one album, but decided to stay in Woodstock where he also worked in the local scene with music icons such as Paul Butterfield's Better Days, Bonnie Raitt, Tim Hardin, Rick Danko, Mike Bloomfield and Merl Saunders. Four years later he played in a band called Encyclopedia of Soul which later on became known as Stuff which was made out of bassist Gordon Edwards, two guitarists named Cornell Dupree and Eric Gale and keyboardist Richard Tee. Later on, in the same band he shared his drum with another rising star, Steve Gadd. In the same time, he cofounded Brecker Brothers, a band which was made out of Michael and Randy Brecker, Buzzy Feiten, David Sanborn, Don Grolnick, Steve Khan, and Will Lee. Throughout three decades (from 1970s to 1990s), he recorded three albums and still performs to this day with such stars and music groups as James Brown, Miles Davis, Aretha Franklin, Ashford & Simpson, Patti Austin, Cher, Michael Bolton, Quincy Jones, Freddie Hubbard and Salt n' Pepa. In 1986, Parker was invited to be a part of Saturday Night Live and served there six years. In 1988, he became a member of Bob Dylan's touring band, which included G.E. Smith, later SNL's music director. Parker played on Donald Fagen's Kamakiriad album, which was nominated for (but did not win) the 1993 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. His song \\"On the Dunes\\" became a part of Steely Dan collection. Discography With Joe Beck * Beck (Kudu, 1975) With Stephen Bishop * Red Cab to Manhattan (Warner Bros.

When the Chileans lifted the blockade of Callao, four privateer ships sallied to earn that bounty. The ships were Mexicana (12 guns), Peru (10 guns), Arequipe√±o (6 guns) and Edmond (5 guns) under the overall command of Juan Blanchet, a former Lieutenant of the French navy.

His academic career spanned nearly eight decades, including almost 40 years working at Princeton University. Early life and education Sherr was born to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants in Long Branch, New Jersey, in 1913. After graduating from Lakewood High School, he attended New York University at his mother's behest, gaining a bachelor's degree in physics in 1934. He then went to study at Princeton University, where he obtained a doctorate in physics in 1938. Manhattan Project In 1942, Sherr joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he worked to develop new airborne radar systems. In 1944, he became involved with the Manhattan Project, which was tasked with creating the first nuclear weapon. Together with Klaus Fuchs, Sherr developed a key component of the bomb's triggering mechanism, the Fuchs‚ÄìSherr polonium- beryllium modulated neutron initiator. On July 16, 1945, Sherr was present at the Trinity nuclear test in New Mexico. He later recalled thinking during the test, \\"'This is the greatest scientific experiment of all time' ‚Äì it was certainly the biggest. Then the horror sank in that the thing had actually worked, followed by relief that the atmosphere hadn't ignited, as some had feared it would.\\" Academic career Sherr became an assistant professor of physics at Princeton University in 1946, an associate professor in 1949, and a full professor in 1955. In 1953, he provided experimental evidence of Fermi's interaction, a theoretical explanation for the beta decay phenomenon. Between 1955 and 1971, he headed an Atomic Energy Commission-contracted nuclear research project, and oversaw the development of Princeton's AVF cyclotron in 1970. Sherr retired from Princeton in 1982, but remained active in the research community for the rest of his life. He published over 100 articles in scientific journals during his career. Personal life Sherr was married to Rita \\"Pat\\" Sherr, with whom he had two daughters. In 1998, after his wife's death, he moved to a retirement community in Haverford, Pennsylvania, where he lived until his death. In his spare time, Sherr was an avid fly fisherman, birdwatcher, and folk music enthusiast who counted the musicologist Alan Lomax among his friends. He died at the age of 99 on July 8, 2013.

Stewart was a commercial Packet steamer. On June 4, 1899, it caught fire and sank in Lake Superior, off the coast of Michigan Island in Chequamegon Bay. The site of the wreck was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History The R.G. Stewart was built in Buffalo, New York, in 1878. It was originally used as a ferry on the Niagara River. The ship was brought to Duluth, Minnesota in 1882 and purchased by Captain Cornelius \\"Con\\" Flynn in 1894. Flynn used the ship to carry passengers and cargo to various ports along the south shore of Lake Superior, and had a very profitable business for several years. On Saturday, June 3, 1899, Flynn left Hancock, Michigan with three passengers and his crew. The cargo included some live cattle. After stopping in Ontonagon, Michigan, The R.G. Stewart was destined for its home port of Duluth. A heavy fog soon developed, making visibility very poor. At 11:00 pm, running blind, the ship suddenly crashed aground on Michigan Island. All efforts to free the ship failed, and the crew decided to wait until morning to deal with the problem. The next morning, the crew watched for other passing boats who could have helped, but no boats were sighted, and Captain Flynn decided to deal with the problem himself. The engines were started, and he pushed them feverishly in hopes of backing the boat off its standing point. Unfortunately, this caused the boilers to overheat, and the ship was set on fire. With the whole ship severely ablaze, the cattle were pushed overboard to save them. The cattle successfully swam to shore. Several of the crew and passengers used the lifeboat, while some swam to shore. All survived, except for a crew member named George McKenna, who drowned. The eleven survivors were found by the keeper of the Michigan Island Light, who offered them food and shelter for the night. The following morning he took them to the mainland in his boat.

It is manufactured with 100% virgin low-density polyethylene. The raw material is extruded and cast on the embossed roll and cooled. It can be of any color. Milky white, French blue, red and yellow are standard colors. The diamond- shaped embossing in the film helps in the easy removal of air between the film and the rubber. Semiembossed film is used by tyre manufacturers, tread and bonding gum manufacturers, conveyor belt manufacturers and other rubber coated fabric manufacturers. Film embossing process Film embossing is a mechanical process in which a flat film is transformed into an embossed product. During the process, thermal and stress fields are applied to the polymer, causing changes in the microstructure and physical dimensions of the material. The engineering analysis of the process requires the study of various aspects relating to the characterization of the microstructure before and after embossing, A variety of techniques were employed to characterize the properties and microstructure of the embossed film in relation to crystallinity, orientation, mechanical properties, and dimensions of the embossed films. The thermal treatment of the polymer film was shown to be the most significant factor in the process. By controlling the thermal treatment of the film, it is possible to manipulate the properties and dimensions of the embossed film. The important aspects: influencing thermal treatment include the radiation heater temperature, preheat roll temperature, line velocity, and film thickness. The initial film orientation and embossing pressure have a minor effect on the final properties of the embossed film. The main effect of the embossing pressure is on the bulk thickness of the embossed film.

History Glendale was founded by William John Murphy in 1892 and was incorporated as a town in 1910. Glendale's economy depended mainly on the agricultural products produced in its farmlands. It wasn‚Äôt until 1902, when the Beet Sugar Factory was built and established in the town, that the town began to grow. The demand of new housing made the real estate around the Glendale Town site a profitable venture.Founder of GlendaleThe First Five: A Brief History of the Salt River Project =Subdivision= Various businessmen invested in the lands around the town site. Among the investors were Lafayette Myers, president of the Glendale State Bank and Otto R. Hansen, a businessman from Wisconsin. By 1914, Hansen subdivided the land in the area into residential lots which he named \\"Catlin Court\\" (after his wife's maiden name). Myers together with A.A. Carrick, a local businessman, formed a real estate agency to promote the sale of the lots. Catlin Court became the first organized building expansion and development program in the city.\\"Glendale Historic Building Survey\\"; Prepared by: Janus Associates for the City of Glendale; 1980 =Architecture= The most common architectural style of the homes are that of the bungalow. Homes in this style which can still be found here are the Otto R. Hansen House, C.M. Wood House\\" and Green McBee/J.B. Ingram House.

Leonid Khabarov leads the march of a Russian reserve officer training unit honor guard Reserve Officer Training in Soviet Union was established in the 1920s. Many military chairs and departments survived in Soviet universities and academies despite the setback which struck military education in the early 1990s after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced his program of unilateral military force withdrawals and reductions. There are 48 military chairs, and 16 military departments within the Russian Ministry of Education, plus one military department, which has been expanded to a separate institute led by Leonid Khabarov.Russian Government Order of March 6, 2008, ‚Ññ275-R According to Lt. Col. F. Edward Jones, an American military analyst with the U.S. Army War College who studied Reserve Forces in the Soviet Military, not all men served on active duty with the Red Army. All students, who were enrolled in a reserve officer training program while in school were exempt from conscript service. An undetermined number of them, particularly those in engineering fields, were later called to active duty as reserve officers for periods ranging from two to three years. There was a particular goal in cross-training civil specialists. In the classless society of the Soviet Union every individual was guaranteed a job. In so doing, those individuals that have a job, have a dual function. Truck drivers for example, worked for whatever organization their job is associated with; they could be drivers who shuttle machine parts from their factory in Kiev to outlying areas, but they were also registered with the local civilian transport enterprise (Avtokolonna) who receive requirements from the local Military commissariat (Voenkomat) for a designated number of trucks for mobilization or a particular military exercise. As these drivers are well trained and are driving a truck that they have driven many times before (civilian trucks are identical to the military version ‚Äì one could do a one-for-one exchange and not suffer any decrement of the mission) the system works out very well. The commanders who are receiving these drivers with their trucks, know exactly how many vehicles they will receive, where they're coming from, their license numbers, and the driver's name. The same is applicable for the rest of the civil specialties, such as medics, mechanics, radio operators, telegraph operators or even jewelers, as well as many others. Christina F. Shelton, the USAF Intelligence employee, noted that contrary to the conventional military educational facilities, whose manpower could be estimated quite precisely, the extent of the Soviet reserve officer corps (those who receive commissions at civilian universities) was unknown. Until 2008, there were 229 civilian institutions of higher education (universities, academies and, strictly speaking, institutions), which had military departments, in Russia.Russian Government Decree of 12 October, 2000, ‚Ññ768 Federal Law of 28 March, 1998, ‚Ññ53-FZ ¬´About military duty and military service¬ªRussian Federation Federal Law of 28 March, 1998, ‚Ññ53-FZ ¬´About military duty and military service¬ª (in version which were valid as 31 December, 2007) provided that only full-time face-to-face learning students of civilian institution of higher education could be accepted to the military department of this civilian institution of higher education (hereinafter in the text also - university). Enrolling in the military department was voluntary for all students. After finishing military department‚Äôs course, including military training camps or traineeship in military units of regular armed forces, and passing the state final exam student was due to be presented the promotion to primary military officer rank (lieutenant). Graduate of the military department was due to be promoted to officer at the same time as his enlisting in the reserve of armed forces. However, the relevant order of ministry of defence entered into force subject to student‚Äôs successful graduation of university in main, civilian degree. Afterwards, such officer could be conscripted from the reserve of armed forces to active duty, but until the age of 27 only. The period of active duty of such officer was 2 years, and at the end of that period he was due to be enlisted in the reserve of armed forces again. On 1 January, 2008, the amendments, contained in Federal Law of 6 July, 2006, ‚Ññ104-FZRussian Federation Federal Law of 6 July, 2006, ‚Ññ104-FZ, entered into force. According to these amendments, conscription of reserve officers was abolished (with exception of short-dated military camps in peaceful time and wartime mobilization). Thus, university graduates, who have graduated the military departments of their almae matres, were not subject to conscription to active duty no more (previously the state has conscripted them selectively). In the same time, the amendments provided the new type of military training unit in universities ‚Äì Training Military Center. The difference between the training military centers and the military departments was that absolutely all of graduates of training military centers were due to be enrolled for active duty immediately upon the university graduation. The period of active duty of such officers was 3 years. Enrolling in the training military center was voluntary. Overall, the training military centers focused on training officers for active duty, whilst the military departments focused on training officers for reserve.Russian Government Decree of 6 March, 2008, ‚Ññ152 Starting on 6 March, 2008, there were 37 training military centers and 68 military departments or military faculties (military faculty consists some various fields military departments) in universities in Russia. Wherein, the military departments or the military faculties continued to operate in all of 37 universities where training military centers were established.Russian Government Order of March 6, 2008, ‚Ññ275-R On 1 January, 2019, the amendments, contained in Federal Law of 3 August, 2018, ‚Ññ309-FZRussian Federation Federal Law of 3 August, 2018, ‚Ññ309-FZ, entered into force.

Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off nozzles differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.  Reasons for using  Shut-off nozzles are used to avoid drooling of the melt and stringing, as well as to feed with a retracted nozzle.Johannaber, Friedrich (2008). Injection Molding Machines: A User's Guide. Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich.  Types  Shut-off nozzles can be self-controlled or externally controlled. = Self-controlled = Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operatedThe needle keeps the nozzle orifice closed by spring pressure. When the injection pressure increases, the melt will push back on the needle head and try to open the nozzle. Once the melt inside the nozzle reaches a certain amount of pressure, it will succeed in pushing the needle back against the spring. There must, therefore, be a minimum pressure for the opening process to overcome the force of the spring.P√∂tsch, Gerd. Michaeli, Walter (2008). Injection Molding: An Introduction. Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich. Once the nozzle opens, the pressure will drop again and the spring- operated needle will close the nozzle tip orifice. = Externally actuated = The nozzle is opened by external force, independent of the melt-pressure. The shut-off nozzle‚Äôs actuation is hydraulically or pneumatically driven. Externally actuated shut-off nozzles can have different ways of closing the melt stream. Due to the fact that they operate independently of melt-pressure, they can be used for a range of applications such as melt pre-compression, physical and chemical foaming and high-speed injection molding.  Needle  Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuationThe melt flow is shut off via a melt channel-axis positioned needle moving back and forth according to actuation. This nozzle type shuts off the melt stream directly at the nozzle orifice-mold interface which prevents drooling.  Bolt  Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuationA shut-off bolt, positioned perpendicular to the melt channel moves up and down according to actuation, and thus shuts off/opens the melt flow. This nozzle type has a single melt channel. It therefore does not require rerouting of the melt around the shut-off mechanism.

Rosenthal and written by Matthew F. Jones, based on his own novel of the same name. It stars Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy, Ted Levine, Kelly Reilly and Jason Isaacs.  Plot  John Moon's wife recently took their son and left. Before John's father died, he was unable to pay the mortgage on the farm, and it was sold. John is depressed and an emotional wreck. He lives in poverty in rural West Virginia, feeding himself by hunting deer. While illegally stalking a deer with a shotgun on Nature Conservancy land, he accidentally shoots and kills a young woman. He then finds a box containing $100,000 in the abandoned van where she was hiding. He hides the woman's body in a shipping container. During the following days, he attempts to reconcile with his wife. He contacts a local attorney to try to negotiate for his wife and son's return home and leaves the attorney several hundred dollars, drawing the attorneys' attention. John visits his son at his wife's apartment and interrupts the babysitter having sex with a recently released convict who has returned home. As he leaves he is threatened by a stranger who resents his glance. Later, while he is in his trailer, someone shoots and kills his dog. In another incident a rock wrapped in a note threatening his family is thrown through the trailer window. John suspects the ex-con is responsible for these events. He enters the ex-con's motel room and is interrupted by the ex-con's return. He hides in the louvered closet. The stranger from outside the diner arrives at the hotel room and asks the ex-con if he's \\"gotten the money back\\". The ex-con tells him that the woman who had the money has died and the stranger is furious. John sees him slit the ex-con's throat. The ex-con falls into the closet. He sees John but is unable to talk before he dies. John avoids detection and goes home. He finds someone has trashed his trailer, apparently looking for the money. The dead girl's body is on his bed with a note. His wife shows up and wants to come inside and get her clothing, but John refuses. John visits the attorney and threatens him with a pistol, trying to force him to reveal what he knows. All he learns is that his wife was concerned about where John got the money and wants to talk to him. John returns to his trailer. A friendly local girl brings him something to eat, and while they are eating outside, the radio in the trailer starts playing loudly. John goes inside to investigate, carrying a pistol. He hears the girl scream outside, and returns to find her held captive by the stranger. John is forced to discard his pistol and knife. The stranger asks John where the money is. John says he buried it nearby. The stranger tells him to go get it, but first cuts off John's right index finger and thumb, to be sure he can't use a weapon. John goes to his truck and gets a scoped rifle. Despite his wounds, he successfully kills the stranger. He takes the girl to town and returns to the trailer and a shed outside, which contains a freezer in which he has hidden the dead woman's body. He drags her body up the hill and digs a hole to bury her. Weakened by loss of blood, he's unable to get out of the hole. He pulls the girl‚Ä≤s body into the hole with him and looks up to see a deer looking down at him from the edge of the hole.

The film was released on September 20, 2013, and distributed in the United States by Tribeca Film. Reception A Single Shot received mixed reviews and has a rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10. The consensus states \\"It has a bleak sense of atmosphere and a terrific performance by Sam Rockwell, but A Single Shot is undercut by its predictable story and slow pace.\\" The film also has a score of 53 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 reviews. Soundtrack The music for A Single Shot was written by Icelandic-born composer Atli √ñrvarsson whose music is strongly rooted in 20th century modernism. The score was recorded with the London Metropolitan Orchestra. The soundtrack has been released digitally and on CD by MovieScore Media / Kronos Records. One of the special things about the soundtrack is that the shorter cues have been organized into movements, thus creating a program that sounds very much like a concert piece.

In contrast with earlier, more aggressive approaches, under FAMACHA only certain sheep or goats in a flock are selected for treatment. Selection for treatment is based on the degree of anaemia the animals are displaying in their mucous membranes, which is assessed through a colour guided chart.  Background  The FAMACHA method of selective treatment was developed by three South African researchers (Drs Francois Malan, Gareth Bath and Jan van Wyk) against the backdrop of major anthelmintic resistance in South Africa. However, the method has since been implemented successfully in various locations around the world. The aim of the method is to maintain a sufficient susceptible H. contortus worm population (‚Äòrefugia‚Äô) on the pasture. By only dosing those sheep in critical need of treatment, selection for worms resistant against treatment is retarded, while at the same time the farmer can monitor and cull those sheep with a poor natural resistance against these worms.  Procedure  Anaemia (as observed in the mucous membrane of the eye) is assessed via a colour guided chart: a sheep with a score of 1 having a pink-red mucous membrane colour and not requiring treatment for haemonchosis; whereas a sheep with a score of 5 has white mucous membranes, requiring immediate dosing for haemonchosis and probably intensive medical treatment.

Lee said the film was initially a black comedy, but during its seven-year pre-production, he made compromises in order to make the film more appealing commercially. Nevertheless, he retained the satirical bent and issues he wanted to highlight, such as gender inequality, and the societal practice where shrewd people are more likely to succeed than those who simply work hard. Though classified as a romantic comedy, Lee called it more of a \\"fantasy,\\" saying, \\"In the end, she gets everything she wanted. But that does not happen in real life no matter how earnestly people live their lives.\\" Lee's background in advertising was also apparent in his incorporation of manga-like screen graphics and animation in the film's backgrounds and visual patterns. Reception How to Use Guys with Secret Tips was released on February 14, 2013. The film produced strong word-of-mouth among viewers, though not enough to make it a hit in a month when it was sharing screens with box office behemoths The Berlin File, New World and Miracle in Cell No. 7. Koreanfilm.org praised the film's \\"great comic timing,\\" the \\"charismatic\\" performances by its lead actors and its \\"multitude of gags that are genuinely funny.\\" The review said it felt \\"fresh and new, but it is also simply a very well executed film. In a genre that looks easy, but is actually quite challenging, this is a significant accomplishment.\\" Twitch Film particularly noted the film's \\"unique, vibrant and endlessly creative aesthetic,\\" and director Lee's \\"keen sense of style.\\" It also said \\"one of the film's great strengths is its excellent soundtrack, which runs the gamut of indie music, pop and club beats, not to mention Ravel.\\" In April 2013, the film won the Audience Award at the 15th Far East Film Festival in Udine, Italy, and director Lee Won-suk also received the Golden Mulberry Award. In August 2013, it won the Bronze Prize for Best Asian Feature at the Fantasia Festival.

He bats and throws right-handed. Amateur career Lee attended Daegu High School from 2006‚Äì2009. In 2008, Lee led the school to its first-ever Phoenix Flag National Championship, the most prestigious national high school competition in South Korea. As a starting pitcher he earned Best Pitcher honors for the tourney as well. Lee helped his team win another major national tournament Blue Dragon Flag National Championship, and finished the 2008 season with a 0.94 ERA in 38‚Öì innings pitched. In 2009 Lee posted a 1.35 ERA in 53‚Öì innings pitched. Although Daegu High School failed to make the finals in the national tournaments during the 2009 season, his high K/9 rate (10.97) subsequently drew the attention of KBO scouts.

The game was released on 22 February 2013. When Old School RuneScape launched, it was originally an August 2007 build of RuneScape. However, it has since received engine improvements, new content, and quality of life updates largely decided by in-game polls. Despite having a smaller development team and a slower relative update schedule, Old School RuneScape has a larger player-base than RuneScape. A mobile version for Android and iOS was released in October 2018. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing a player in combat with a goblin The input mechanics are mainly point-and-click. The player controls a single character and can interact with NPCs, objects, and entities in the game world by left- clicking, or selecting an option from the object's right-click menu, since many objects can offer more than one interaction option. Old School RuneScape, like RuneScape, makes profit through a membership subscription that gives free-to-play members access to the full \\"pay-to-play\\" content of the game. =Ironman Mode= Old School RuneScape offers an \\"Ironman\\" game mode wherein players are completely barred from economic interaction with other players, and they must be completely self-sufficient. Ironman mode players cannot take items that other players have dropped, sold to stores, or left on the ground from kills. First introduced in October 2014, this is often considered one of the most difficult ways to play the game, as many late-game items only come from high level bosses and have a small chance of being obtained. Although these accounts can still use all of the game's chat features, the game mode is often touted as a \\"single-player\\" experience due to the necessity of solo exploration of the game world for progression. The game features several variations of the normal Ironman mode, including an \\"Ultimate Ironman Mode\\" that cannot use the in-game banks and a \\"Hardcore Ironman Mode\\" that turns into a normal Ironman account after dying for the first time. =Deadman Mode= Deadman Mode is a separate incarnation of Old School RuneScape released on 29 October 2015, which features open-world player versus player combat and accelerated experience rates. If one player kills another, the victor receives a key to a chest letting them loot items from their victim's account. Players who engage other players in combat will be marked with a skull icon ‚Äì \\"skulled\\" players come under attack from NPCs if they try to enter safe cities, and the number of keys they are holding will be visible to other players making them an obvious target. Players who die in Deadman Mode will lose a significant portion of their experience points in all but five skills of the player's choice. Additionally, Jagex hosts separate, recurring \\"Deadman Tournaments\\" where players can qualify for a final elimination round, incentivised by monetary prizes. The Autumn Finals of September 2018 boasted a 20,000 grand prize. =Leagues= At RuneFest 2019, Jagex announced a special new high-speed gamemode with similarities to Deadman Mode called \\"Old School Runescape Leagues\\". Leagues contrast with the original servers in that they, much like Deadman Mode, will exist as a separate game instance and only exist for a short amount of time. A League is intended to run for two months. Players in this gamemode compete with others to progress faster and farther before the two month deadline is over. Players that join select game servers will start anew, have vastly increased experience rates, and have the ability to unlock special permanent perks that add further multipliers to rewards and experience.https://www.pcgamesn.com/runescape/runefest-2019-archaeology The first iteration of Leagues was entitled the \\"Twisted League\\" and ran from November 14, 2019 until January 16, 2020. In this League, players were restricted to the regions of the Kebos Lowlands and Great Kourend. Release In response to the declining player base and negative update reception of the original and then-current version of RuneScape, Jagex CEO Mark Gerhard officially announced a poll for the creation of Old School RuneScape in a news article in February 2013. The article explained that an August 2007 backup of RuneScape was located in the company's backup archives. The company admitted that the game had changed a lot and that the backup could be used to create a separate version of the game if the players desired. In the article, Jagex explained the goals of the poll, and what each number bracket would unlock for the player community. In two weeks, it received enough votes for the game to be released. The ending total vote count was 449,351, which fell short of the 500,000 mass reward tier. Jagex did however incorporate three of the five incentives of the highest tier by approving vote based polls on all content, upgraded bot protection, and no additional fees for this game mode. Old School RuneScape was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on 22 February 2013. Upon release, the game was only playable for accounts that had a membership subscription. The option for non-members to play in the limited free-to-play areas was granted in February 2015. In contrast to the original game, Old School RuneScape does not offer micro-transactions, and has a playerbase that heavily opposes them. Although Old School RuneScape has a small team of developers relative to that of the live version of RuneScape, it receives regular patches and new content of that of a flagship product. Most updates and changes are polled, and can be voted on in-game. The proposed updates are voted on by players, and are only implemented if 75 percent of paying players accept them. Poll results used to be visible to everyone before casting their votes, but after April 2019, poll results became hidden until the conclusion of the polls. A mobile client of the game for Android and iOS devices was released on 30 October 2018. In under two weeks, it became the most downloaded mobile game in eight different countries, surpassing a million downloads.  Controversies  = 2017 Pride Event = In June 2017, the addition of an LGBT-themed holiday event, in which players were tasked with finding the pieces to create a rainbow scarf, caused controversy among players for being seen as political and out of place. = Gold farming = The Rules of RuneScape prohibit players from engaging in the real-world sale or purchase of items, GP or services. Despite the repercussions for gold farming, including the banning of suspected accounts, players continue to amass Old School RuneScape gold with the intention of selling it for real-life currency on third party websites. Awards The game was nominated for the \\"Heritage\\" and \\"Best Role-Playing Game\\" awards at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018 and 2019, and won the award for \\"EE Mobile Game of the Year\\" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards.

It was designed by Eaton & Bates and built from 1892 to 1930s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Royal Hotel in Maryborough is a substantial rendered brick building, constructed in 1902 to designs of Messrs Eaton and Bates, architects of Rockhampton. The present hotel was built for Richard Hyne, a local pioneer who developed many local manufacturing and community initiatives. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì1848, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852 the growing town was gradually transferred further north where ships were able to better navigate the river. Development followed and by March 1861, Maryborough was declared a municipality, the Borough of Maryborough. One of the early settlers in the area, Mr ET Aldridge established a hotel, apparently first known as the Victoria but later named the Bush Inn, in the old town in 1848. In 1856, Aldridge moved the hotel to the south of the River in Kent Street, where the present Royal Hotel is situated, with the shifting of the focus of development. This was a large two storeyed timber building. During the 1860s Maryborough flourished as a result of the gold discoveries in Gympie, for which it became the primary port. In 1870 a first floor timber balcony with cross-braced balustrade was added to the Bush Inn, which was to become known as the Royal Hotel in the next few years, by the owner, Mr Cooper. In 1873, Richard Hyne took over the licence. Prior to establishing himself in Maryborough, Hyne engaged in various businesses in Gympie, including the running of the Mining Exchange Hotel. Astutely, he realised that Maryborough would become a permanent centre and port for the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett district and moved to the town, where he immediately became involved with the running of the Bush Inn/Royal Hotel. Hyne was interested in establishing Maryborough as a major respected centre, and worked towards improving health, education, welfare and recreation facilities. He was mayor for a term in 1878. Upon arriving in Maryborough, Hyne acquired the lease of the Royal Hotel in mid 1873 and purchased the hotel soon after. Hyne busied himself with improving the hotel, he added bathrooms and replaced the timber balustrading on the balconies with a cast iron balustrade and established a driveway where he planted several Bunya Pines in 1878. This former Royal Hotel did not occupy the site immediately adjacent to the corner, and a two storeyed masonry building was constructed by Hyne on this corner site in 1892‚Äì1893. This two storeyed building, which was to be incorporated into the current Royal Hotel, was designed by William Devon, a local architect as a shop for Hanleys, drapers in the town. Hanleys remained in the shop for about five years, when Finlaysons took over the lease until the shop became the public bar of the new Royal Hotel in 1902. As the town continued to prosper, the Royal Hotel soon became the leading hotel establishment, and many important civic functions were held there. By 1900 the question of modernising the hotel arose. In a letter to Hyne from a relative in Glasgow, the latter suggests that plans be acquired for the best use of the site, with a corner bar, sitting rooms and an imposing front entrance, preferably further away from the public bar, as \\"this area is always objectionable to Ladies\\". Other suggestions included the filling in of the front with shops and the provision of accommodation for 40 on the first floor. A decision was duly taken to rebuild the Royal Hotel, and a competition of Queensland architects was held, from which eight entries were received and Messrs Eaton and Bates were chosen. The design competition specified that the new hotel was to incorporate \\"the best features of the Oriental Hotel in Colombo and Shepheards Hotel in Cairo\\". Though the final design was obviously not as elaborate as either of the hotels cited, it does have many features which could be loosely described as having eastern origin, in particular the open entrance, first floor loggias and the stair hall with their openness, arcades and tiling. The drawings which survive from this competition, now in the hands of the Hyne family, are signed by Messrs Eaton, Bates and Garlick. When constructed the Royal Hotel was described as one of the finest hotels north of Sydney and the most complete in Australia. It incorporated the building on the corner of Kent and Bazaar Streets and extended along Kent Street with the principal entrance on this facade. Through this was a large entrance vestibule, open to the street through wide archways, beyond which was the extravagant stair hall. A large dining room, to the right of the stair hall, extended through two stories, with a gallery encircling the room at the first floor level and a large clerestoried ceiling section. Elsewhere on the ground floor was a large billiard room, the bar area, on the corner of the streets, and sample rooms for the requirements of commercial travellers. The bar area incorporated a public bar, two parlours and two private bars, all of which could be served from the same counter. On the first floor accommodation facilities were provided, those facing Kent Street opening onto a long arched loggia. Shops were found on the ground floor of the Kent Street elevation. The hotel was not fully completed when Richard Hyne died on 5 July 1902, but action had been taken by this stage to move to the new hotel. Many parts of the hotel was refurbished during the 1930s. The lounge was renovated in 1932, under the supervision of local architect POE Hawkes, when a timber floor and wall panelling was introduced, and fibrous cement was used to clad the ceiling. A variety of locally grown hardwood timbers, including mountain ash, red gum, spotted gum and iron bark supplied by Hyne and Son timber merchants, were used to create the striking parquetry floor. Tenders were called, again by architect Philip Oliver Ellard Hawkes, on 21 September 1934 for the erection of a cantilevered awning clad with Wunderlich pressed metal panels to the front of the hotel, though this was not erected until 1939, when the shop fronts were modernised. This work was completed by local contractor, SV Stevens, and a stipulation of the contract was the employment of only local labour. The hotel remained in the ownership of the Hyne family until 1960, when it was sold to another established Maryborough family, the Williams. The shops to the Kent Street elevation remain, and a family restaurant is situated in the entrance and dining room.  Description  The Royal Hotel is a substantial two-storeyed rendered masonry building on a prominent intersection on the corner of Kent and Bazaar Streets, Maryborough. The hipped corrugated iron roof, featuring a prominent glazed roof lantern, is concealed by a rendered masonry parapet of Italianate balusters, punctuated by a series of moulded panels. The principal facade, from Kent Street, is symmetrically composed around a central bay surmounted by a curved pediment above a moulded panel projecting above the parapet, emphasising the entrance. The symmetrical quality of the facade is offset by the addition of a cantilevered awning which features an arched detail, not over the principal entrance designated by the central bay, but over on an arched opening to the right of this. The central bay is flanked by a series of arcaded bays, divided by pilasters rendered to imitate vermiculated stonework. The ground floor features a series of large arched openings, some of which are balustraded, and flanking these are bipartite round headed arched windows to the public bar toward Bazaar Street, and modernised shop fronts in the other direction. The central bay is flanked on the first floor by five bay arched loggias terminated by the end wings of the building which feature three arched window openings, over an italianate baluster panel. The first floor loggia provides an indication of the original open character of the central section of the ground floor. The cantilevered awning which is attached to the building with a series of iron tie-backs, has an elaborate soffit of coffered pressed metal panels and a reeded pressed metal fascia. The awning extends the whole distance of the Kent Street facade, is curved around the corner and extends only a short distance on the Bazaar Street facade. Surmounted on the Kent and Bazaar Street corner of the hotel is an illuminated sign supported on metal framework with lettering, \\"ROYAL\\". Windows to the first floor nearest the corner of Kent and Bazaar Streets retain double hung sashes, though most other openings in the building have been glazed with aluminium-framed windows. Leadlight glazing survives on the upper sashes of several arched windows of the public bar. Window joinery to the Bazaar Street elevation is generally more intact. The building has a rear first floor verandah, access from which is gained by a straight timber stair. The building is accessed via the centrally located principal entrance, originally an open loggia entrance vestibule, but now closed with glazing. This space features a fine tessellated and encaustic tiled floor, which continues in less decorative form into the entrance hall and dining room. The entrance hall is punctuated by an arcade supported on heavy masonry columns with stylised ionic capitals, initiating the stair and forming a walkway through the space, indicating the entrances to other rooms. The bifurcating dog leg stair features very fine cedar joinery of carved timber balusters joined by a carved panel below the handrail. Heavy columns flanking the stair are met by the expanding lower treads and the wreathed handrail. The dining room, originally extending through two storeys with gallery above, is now ceiled at the first floor. The coved ceiling of the gallery space features a large central clerestory, now boarded below the windows. Reeded pilasters line the plaster walls, and access to the loggia is given through a number of half glazed french doors. The upper floor has a number of accommodation rooms, all with access to the loggia or rear verandah. The timber framed and boarded rooms retain original detailing including four panel doors, with timber fretwork transoms above and timber skirting and architraves. A large clerestory in the corridor provides natural lighting. The public bar and subsidiary ground floor rooms have been substantially altered. A one storeyed concrete block extension has been added to the south of the Bazaar Street elevation. To the rear of the early building is an area of partially surfaced car parking.  Heritage listing  Royal Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Royal Hotel is important in demonstrating the pattern of development in Maryborough. A hotel has been on the site since the initial stages of the development of the new town of Maryborough, and the subsequent rebuildings indicate various phases of the town's prosperity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The hotel demonstrates the principal characteristics of a large hotel in a Queensland country town, designed to provide superior accommodation to attract travellers and local clientele. The hotel is influenced by eastern design traditions, appropriate in the sub- tropical climate of Maryborough. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The well composed exterior employing classically derived features and the finely detailed interior, of high quality planning, joinery, tiling and plaster work, contribute to an impressive building, of value for its aesthetic characteristics. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building is important to the local community and recognised as the premier hotel in Maryborough, and a centre of the town's social life since its construction in 1902. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is associated with the Hyne family, important pioneers of Maryborough and in particular with Mr RM Hyne, and also the Queensland architects, Eaton and Bates.

The EPCAAL had close fellowship with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of France. History =Reformation in Alsace and northeastern Lorraine= In the early 16th century Alsace and northeastern Lorraine were part of the Holy Roman Empire with the region being partitioned into many different imperial states. Most were monarchies (Duchy of Lorraine, County of Saarwerden, Landgraviate of Upper Alsace, County of Salm), but also several republics (ten free imperial cities federated in the D√©capole) and portions of certain ecclesiastical principalities (prince-bishoprics of Metz, of Speyer, and of Strasbourg). While the prince-bishops tried to suppress any change towards the Reformation, the monarchies either adopted it or fought it, depending on the positions of their lords. The free imperial cities went through a process of discussion and conflict, winning over a majority of the burghers for the Reformation or not. The Free Imperial City of Mulhouse adopted Calvinism and joined the Swiss Confederation until the French blockade forced the city to accept French supremacy in 1795. St. Aurelia Church in Strasbourg In 1523 and 1524, the Free Imperial City of Strasbourg became the next state in Alsace to adopt Lutheranism.Annie Noblesse-Rocher, \\"The Reformation in Alsace\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. Most publishers in Strasbourg agreed to diffuse new ideas by issuing Reformers' tracts and numerous pamphlets. This allowed well-known preachers such as Matth√§us Zell, a priest at the Strasbourg Cathedral, to propagate Reformatory theses to a large, enthusiastic community. In the same year theologians and exegetes including Wolfgang Capito, Caspar Hedio, and Martin Bucer, strengthened and built up the Reformatory movement amongst craftsmen and the moderately well to do of Strasbourg. In 1524, St. Aurelia, the market gardeners' parish, asked Bucer to become its pastor and preacher. Bucer had met Martin Luther in 1518 and adopted his ideas.\\"Martin Bucer (1491-1551)\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. He then helped implement the Reformation in the Free Imperial City of Wissembourg in Alsace, which resulted in his excommunication by George of the Palatinate, the bishop of Speyer, and his conviction as outlaw. In 1523 he found asylum in Strasbourg, where he set up Bible reading classes and later, in 1529, presented the Reformation. He received John Calvin, who had been expelled from Geneva in 1538. Bucer tried to safeguard the unity of the Church, but failed in reconciling Luther and Zwingli, or bringing Catholics and Protestants to agree at least on some points. At his urging, the city of Strasbourg granted asylum to the persecuted anabaptists. By 1525 the Reformation was gradually spreading not only into the countryside possessions of Strasbourg, but also into territories of other overlords. Although most capitular canons in the Great Chapter, the chapters of Strasbourg's Old St. Peter's and Young St. Peter's, like much of the traditional clergy, rejected the Reformation, the prince-bishop of Strasbourg, , failed to satisfy the demand for change. Already before the start of the Reformation, adherents of the Bundschuh movement in Alsace had demanded the right to elect their pastors on their own. The Lutheran church was the state church in the Free Imperial City of Strasbourg, administered by the city government (Magistrate). The city government passed laws on preaching and appropriated the Strasbourg Cathedral for the Lutheran state church in 1524. It granted the Lutheran church the right to induct pastors in the seven parishes in the town and took the responsibility, normally attributed to deacons, of supporting the poor. In 1529 the city government, supported by a large part of the population, decided that the Holy Mass should be abolished. Violent iconoclasm spread ‚Äì notably among craftsmen ‚Äì destroying many religious images. The Church of Strasbourg built up its liturgical, doctrinal, and ecclesiastical structures. The church authorities instituted a bimonthly meeting of the pastors and three representatives of the Magistrate (Kirchenpfleger), in order to deal with all matters concerning teaching and doctrine. Later, upon more reflection, some liturgical aspects of iconographic nature as well as other previously abolished traditions of church life were reintroduced (such as the Christmas Feast Day). On the occasion of the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where Luther's followers presented the Augsburg Confession, theologians from Strasbourg, Bucer and Capito, authored the Tetrapolitan Confession, adopted by the cities of Constance, Lindau, Memmingen, and Strasbourg. The Church of Strasbourg adopted this confession and developed a theology midway between Zwinglian symbolism and the Lutheran conception of Holy Communion. This midway position was of a moderate and diaconal nature, and quite characteristic of the Reformation along the Rhine. Gymnase Jean- Sturm in Strasbourg In the beginning, church discipline was not too strict. Various religious groups were tolerated within the parishes until 1534, when the Magistrate, for fear of dissent, put an end to the toleration. A decree of that year emphasised the importance of the study of the Bible and of inner piety. The educational level of the pastors enabled the development of a catechism and the improvement of the quality of instruction given to future pastors. In 1538 a Great School was opened, now known as the Gymnase Jean- Sturm, which is still run by the EPCAAL today. It was directed by the humanist Johannes Sturm and educated the elite of Lower Alsace. The Augsburg Interim (1548), demanding the re-institution of Catholicism, had little effect in Alsace and northeastern Lorraine, so that most Protestant states were able to maintain their faith until the Treaty of Augsburg granted the to the regnant princes or magistrates ruling the respective imperial states. Summepiscopate included the cuius regio, eius religio privilege to impose the faith of the inhabitants of one's state. At the end of the 16th century, under the guidance of Johann Marbach, Alsace adopted the orthodox Lutheran ideas contained in the Formula of Concord of 1577. Even within the cathedral chapter of the Strasbourg diocese, Lutheran capitular canons formed the majority (, 1583‚Äì1604). In 1592 this majority elected John George of Brandenburg as the first Lutheran prince-bishop of Strasbourg. After the Catholic counts of the House of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken, ruling the County of Saarwerden, became extinct in the male line in 1574, the Lutheran House of Nassau-Weilburg inherited the county and Philip IV, Count of Nassau-Weilburg introduced the Reformation there. The territory of the former county in the environs of Sarrewerden still shows a high Lutheran share among the overall population. =Since the French annexation of Alsace and northeastern Lorraine= In the course of the 16th to 19th centuries during its eastward expansion France gradually annexed more and more territories of the Holy Roman Empire. Unlike in France proper (or interior France) Protestants in the Alsatian and Lorrain territories annexed by France after 1648 enjoyed a certain protection by the Treaty of Westphalia, of which France was a signatory. The treaty guaranteed to maintain the religious status quo as given in the reference year of 1624 in all the territories acquired since. So Alsatian and Lorrain Protestants were spared from the worst persecutions such as compulsory reconversion, galley slavery or religious child abduction. But other restrictions were imposed. The Lutheran Strasbourg Minster was expropriated and Prince-Bishop Franz Egon of F√ºrstenberg reconsecrated it as Catholic Cathedral on 30 September 1681. In 1684 Louis XIV decreed that all Lutheran and Reformed congregations have to leave the quires of their church buildings for celebrating Holy Masses if there was no Catholic church at the place but at least seven Roman Catholic families. Thus hundreds of church buildings owned by Protestant congregations became de facto simultaneums. Munster In 1800 220,000 Lutherans in Alsace and the territory of Belfort accounted for one third of the population, and lived mostly in ancient free cities such as Munster, Colmar in Alsace, and Wissembourg, but mainly in Strasbourg where 25,000 out of the 38,000 inhabitants were Protestants, mostly Lutherans.N.

Cf. N. N., \\"Protestantism in Alsace\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. There were 160 Lutheran parishes and over 200 active pastors. The Protestant churches in France experienced a restructuring under Napol√©on I. After he had concluded the Concordat of 1801 with the Vatican he decreed the organic articles also concerning the non- Catholic communities of religion (Calvinists, Jews, Lutherans) imposing on them parastatal executive bodies (consistories), constituting and recognising these communities as √©tablissements publics du culte (public bodies of cult) and subjecting them to state control. On 8 April 1802 Napoleon decreed the establishment of 27 Lutheran consistories, with their ambits comprising several congregations with parishioners amounting to at least 6,000 souls altogether. The chief spiritual board, the General Consistory (Consistoire g√©n√©rale) was established in Strasbourg in Alsace, the region with the biggest share of Lutherans among the overall population. Thus the √âglise de la Confession d‚ÄôAugsbourg de France (under this name until 1906) received the basics of its constitution.Fran√ßois-George Dreyfus, \\"The organisation of the Protestant community\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. The chief executive body, the directory (directoire) was also seated in Strasbourg. The strong parastatalism within consistorial system proved in March 1848, when after overthrowing the monarchy the royalist Lutheran directory was forced into resignation under the accusation of antirepublicanism. The then planned democratisation of the Lutheran bodies did not materialise for the time being. With Louis-Napol√©on's takeover the decree of 26 March 1852 streamlined and further centralised the governing body of the church, renaming the General Consistory as Supreme Consistory. Accounting for the population growth and migration (mostly labour migration) new congregations emerged in the former Lutheran Diaspora; therefore the number of Lutheran consistories was increased to 40 by the same decree. =Reshape: Lutheran bodies in Alsace-Lorraine forming the EPCAAL= After France had declared war on North Germany and invaded its component state of Prussia in 1870 the latter's troops and allied forces had defeated France in 1871 (Franco-German War). By the Treaty of Frankfurt France then ceded Alsace and northeastern Lorraine, becoming the new Alsace-Lorraine. 286,000 French Lutherans and their chief bodies then happened to reside within Unified Germany. The 45,000 Lutherans living in remaining France (la France int√©rieure), soon growing in number to 80,000 through Lutheran Optants from the annexed areas and other immigrants, had to reorganise their religious community forming new bodies. St. Thomas Lutheran Church The new German administration was very reluctant to alter or pass new laws corcerning the religion. , already since 1849 consistorial councillor in the Supreme Consistory and a member of the Directory since 1866, rendered great service to the Lutheran church during its adaptation to the altered political situation and its transformation into a regionally confined Protestant church within Alsace-Lorraine. Bruch was a member of the interim church directory and pushed through the reconstitution of the Lutheran church in the German-annexed area as the Kirche Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses von Elsass und Lothringen. This smooth transformation was possible since the Supreme Consistory and the Directory were both based in Strasbourg. With most French Lutherans living in Alsace-Lorraine the church and its parishes remained intact, while the 45,000 Lutherans in interior France were cut off from their central bodies. With the Reformed Church in Alsace-Lorraine the situation was reversed, the 35,000 Calvinists were disconnected from their mainland and central institutions in interior France. Also the three Israelite consistories in the area had been cut off from the Paris-based Central Consistory. Catholics formed the majority in Alsace-Lorraine but Lutherans, a religious minority, came second before the Calvinists, whereas in interior France this ranking among the Protestants was reversed. In centralist France Calvinists had a certain influence with their vivid and active community in Paris, in Strasbourg Lutherans formed the majority and had their headquarters, while Calvinists were underrepresented there. Thus in Alsace-Lorraine the relative strength of the two Protestant churches was reversed, enforcing Lutheran self-confidence with intact institutions. Proponents of Calvinism and Judaism then took the endeavour to form new statewide umbrella organisations.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden und Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 80. . But in 1872 Upper President rejected the Calvinist and Jewish proposals, arguing he would interfere as little as possible in the current state of legal affairs of Alsace-Lorraine as long as no Alsace-Lorrainese legislative body were established.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 81. . After 1871 many people from interior Germany settled in Alsace-Lorraine, among them rather few Calvinists, because Calvinism is a minority faith among the German Protestants, who then still formed a majority in the German overall population. In all the then three German federal states adjacent to Alsace- Lorraine, Baden, the Bavarian Palatinate and Prussia, the Reformed and Lutheran church bodies had merged, either through a united Protestant confession (Evangelical State Church in Baden as of 1821, Protestant State Church of the Palatinate as of 1817) or in administration only (by way of a united umbrella) maintaining separate confessions in the local congregations (Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces; united umbrella since 1817). So Protestant officials from interior Germany delegated to posts in Alsace-Lorraine often had no routine with a Reformed and a Lutheran church existing side by side.In fact only in the Prussian province of Hanover a Reformed and a Lutheran state church with considerable membership each existed side by side. This caused their expectation for the Reformed and the Lutheran churches in Alsace-Lorraine to unite, especially since the head of state of Alsace-Lorraine, the German Emperor himself, in personal union king of Prussia was as such the supreme governor of the united old-Prussian church body. Also among the Lorrain Calvinists was a strong preference for a united church.The unwillingness of the Reformed consistory of Metz, aiming at a united Protestant church, to cooperate with the other four Reformed consistories in Alsace-Lorraine, blocked for a long time the formation of a Reformed umbrella body, since the continuously valid French law required five Reformed consistories to convoke a regional synod. However, the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession perpetuated its existence with the ambit of its supreme consistory and directory restrained to the congregations in Alsace and the new German Department of Lorraine only. In the last quarter of the 19th century quarrels over the Catholic joint use of Lutheran (and Reformed) church buildings rose.Cf. ‚ÄûSimultaneum\\", on: Wiki-protestants.org, retrieved on 26 February 2013. 120 Lutheran and Reformed church buildings were jointly used for Holy Masses in the 1880s. Between 1903 and 1914 , son of Ernst Curtius, led the EPCAAL as president of the directory. In 1905 he was further elected president of the supreme consistory.Theologischer und philosophischer Briefwechsel 1900-1965, Werner Zager (ed.), Munich: Beck, 2006, (=Werke aus dem Nachla√ü Albert Schweitzers; edited by Richard Br√ºllmann), p. 191\\\\. . Together with Bishop he tried to calm down the quarrels over the simultaneum churches but in vain. Many disputes only ended when the Catholic parishes moved out into new-built Catholic churches. The charitable fund of the ≈íuvre des √©glises mixtes enabled the construction of new Catholic churches so that the number of simultaneous uses of Protestant church buildings decreased to 64 cases by 1914. By the 1911 constitution of Alsace-Lorraine the heads of the √©tablissements publics du culte, of the 1898-formed Calvinist EPRAL, of the two Catholic dioceses, of the community of the three Israelite consistories and of the EPCAAL were ex officio members of the upper house of the , the Landtag. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 the imperial administration forbade using French as preaching language. Curtius and other church leaders sharply protested at the administration. When it did not revoke the prohibition, Curtius resigned as president of the directory of the EPCAAL in 1914. =From 1919 to 1940= According to the ceasefire German troops had to leave Alsace-Lorraine still in November 1918 and French troops, warmly welcomed, captured the territory in the same month. The Landtag continued to govern, but revolutionary revolts were only to be subjected by the French troops. Between 1918 and 1920, the year when the Treaty of Versailles by which Germany ceded Alsace-Lorraine to France became effective, the autonomy continued before the French law was implemented in the reannexed territory. After much of debate and complaints over the uniformity by which existing law and practice in Alsace-Lorraine would be levelled to French standards, a compromise was found. All French law, never abolished in Alsace-Lorraine, but in France, such as the 1801 concordat and the Organic Articles done away with by the French Law on separating Religion and state in 1905, would continue in Alsace and the Moselle department. Other laws, also newer regulations enacted by the Alsace-Lorrain legislation or the Reichstag, would persist if they were doomed better or without adequate French counterpart replacing them. So the organic articles, the concordat, Bismarck's social security laws (later replaced when French social security developed) became the system of the Local law in Alsace-Moselle. As to Christianity Alsace and Moselle have two more Christian feasts, Good Friday and the 26 December as Second Christmas Day, as public holiday. Also labour on Sundays is much more restrained in Alsace and Moselle than in interior France. So the EPCAAL ‚Äì like the Catholic dioceses, the Israelite consistories and the Reformed church ‚Äì retained its status as √©tablissement public du culte, whereas other religious bodies rank as religious associations in French law. This meant that clergy is paid with government funds, the State University of Strasbourg runs a faculty of Protestant theology, religious instruction is a subject in public schools and denominational schools are allowed. On the other hand, all elected functionaries and pastors of the EPCAAL are to be government-confirmed and can only then be appointed. This legal difference between Alsace and Moselle and interior France prevents the EPCAAL to reunite with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of France (this name as of 1906), which is subject to strict la√Øcity. After France ‚Äì in the scope of French centralism ‚Äì had abolished the parliament of Alsace-Lorraine and many other features of regional autonomous administration the religious communities and the droit local form elements establishing Alsatian and Lorrain identity. In 1927 - after substantial doctrinal quarrels ‚Äì some congregations split from EPCAAL and form today's Evangelical Lutheran Church ‚Äì Synod of France and Belgium. In the Second World War many representatives of French statehood and politics fled Alsace and Lorraine or were evacuated in 1939 and 1940, among them Robert H≈ìpffner, president of the directory of the EPCAAL, who was exiled in P√©rigueux like many more EPCAAL pastors.Ernest Muller, ‚ÄûMaurer Charles‚Äú, in: Dictionnaire du monde religieux dans la France contemporaine: 10 vols., Paris: Beauchesne, 1985-2001, vol. 2: 'L'Alsace' (1987), Jean-Marie Mayeur (ed.), pp. 285‚Äì287, here p. 286\\\\. . =Under German occupation= The German occupation started in May 1940 and the occupants subjected Alsace to a Nazi party administration by joining Alsace with Baden through forming the Nazi party Gau Baden-Alsace. The Moselle department became the CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen, to be administered by Nazi officials of the Gau Westmark. The Nazi administration suspected EPCAAL to be a potential obstacle to the streamlining. So EPCAAL was territorially divided into an Alsatian and a Lorrain branch. The Lutheran congregations in the CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen were assigned to the united Protestant German United Protestant-Evangelical-Christian Church of the Palatinate, a synod governed by a majority of proponents of the so-called Movement of German Christians. The Alsatian rump of the Lutheran church with its supreme consistory and directory was reconstituted as the Evangelical Lutheran Regional Church of Alsace (Evangelisch-lutherische Landeskirche des Elsass).Ernest Muller, \\"Maurer Charles\\", in: Dictionnaire du monde religieux dans la France contemporaine: 10 vols., Paris: Beauchesne, 1985‚Äì2001, vol. 2: 'L'Alsace' (1987), Jean-Marie Mayeur (ed.), pp. 285‚Äì287, here p. 287\\\\. . On 26 June 1940 the Nazi administration appointed Charles Maurer, Pastor in Schwindratzheim, as acting president of the directory. He had earlier been the editor of the weekly ¬´Friedensbote¬ª and active within the movement of Alsatian autonomists. After the outbreak of the war in 1939 the French government had interned him and other autonomists in Arches, from where he was released when the French forces withdrew into interior France. In 1941 the Nazi administration repealed the Organic Articles, stopped salarying the pastors, closed the denominational schools, forbade religious instruction in public schools and confiscated the estates of religious associations and foundations. The status as √©tablissement public du culte was repealed too and the church turned into a mere private association, similar to the legal situation of the churches in the Warthegau. With support by the and aided by the Nazi-opposing Confessing Church movement the Alsatian Lutheran church could prevent its incorporation into the Protestant Reich Church. The Alsatian Lutheran church smarted from shortage of funds and pastors, of whom many were exiled in interior France. Under Maurer the church could carry on the work of several expropriated charitable associations and endowments, however, under restrictive conditions. The remaining pastors tried to compensate the shortage of clergy by copying preaches then read by laymen from the pulpits (so-called Lesepredigten) and pupils got religious instruction in newly formed Sunday school courses. Collegial bodies, like the Alsatian Lutheran consistories, were replaced by deaneries (Dekanate) supervised by one-man hierarchies following the F√ºhrerprinzip. In order to escape the supervision by the Gestapo, important items were not discussed anymore in the official church bodies but in spontaneously formed unofficial circles (such as the Pfarrkonvente, pastors' conventions). Maurer succeeded to rescue the personal belongings left behind by exiled pastors and professors from being seized by the occupants. When the occupation force offered Maurer to restitute the Catholic Strasbourg Cathedral for Lutheran service Maurer refused recognising this proposal as attempt to rule and divide the Alsatian denominations. When the combat actions reached Alsace in late 1944 Maurer resigned from church leadership. On 1 May 1945 H≈ìpffner resumed his office and EPCAAL resumed existence including the Lutheran congregations in Moselle. In 1947 Maurer was arrested and sentenced as collaborationist in the following year. =Since 1945= After the Second World War French authorities again aimed at levelling the regional peculiarities in Alsace-Moselle, however, the plans never materialised. Since 1905 strict la√Øcit√© is the organising principle in most of France, whereas the previously recognised religious communities of the Calvinists, Catholics, Jews, and Lutherans in Alsace-Moselle preserved their concordatary status of the period between 1802 and 1904 including the Organic Articles. So EPCAAL, like the other afore-mentioned communities, enjoys government cofinancing of denominational schools, the faculty of Protestant theology at the Strasbourg University, which anyway had emerged from the former Lutheran academy of Strasbourg, is used by students to become theologians or pastors and its professors of theology are appointed with consent of the church. Therefore, the EPCAAL cannot merge with the new Evangelical Lutheran Church of France unless the EPCAAL would waive its concordatary status, which also provides for the clergy being paid by the government and Lutheran pupils in public schools entitled to participate in religious instruction classes following EPCAAL guidelines. In the 21st century still about 50 Protestant churches in Alsace- Moselle are co-used for Catholic masses as provided by the decree of 1684. Organisation The EPCAAL has its headquarters in Strasbourg. The Church has a presbyterial-synodal system of church government. The legislative body of EPCAAL is the supreme consistory, consisting of elected and ex officio members. Before formally taking on office each member is to be appointed, and thus confirmed by the French prime minister. The central executive body is the directory. =Ecclesiastical inspections and consistories= According to the Organic Articles the 208 congregations (paroisses, literally parishes) of the EPCAAL (as of 2005) are grouped in 40 consistories, terming the board and its district alike.Cf. \\"Etudes: Cultes protestants\\" , on: Institut du Droit Local Alsacien-Mosellan (IDL), retrieved on 17 December 2013. The consistories are √©tablissements publics des cultes too, each disposing of property of its own and receiving contributions by the member parishes. Each consistory comprises all the pastors active in its district and the double number of laypersons, elected in three year terms by the local church presbyteries, as well as some members co√∂pted by the church executive Directory. The consistorial members elect from their midst their executive, the consistorial council (Conseil consistorial) of four members. Consistorial decisions are presented to the French minister of the Interior, who may oppose them within a two-months period, and reported to the superior EPCAAL Supreme consistory (Consistoire sup√©rieur). The 40 consistories form again part of seven ecclesiastical inspections (inspections eccl√©siastiques), seated in Bouxwiller (Lower Alsace), Brumath, Colmar (Upper Alsace), Dorlisheim, La Petite-Pierre, Strasbourg and Wissembourg in Alsace. =Presidents of the directory= The presidents of the directory () and their vice presidents are ex officio members of the supreme consistory. Furthermore, the president is ex officio president of the St. Thomas in Strasbourg (Chapitre de Saint-Thomas; confirmed on 29 November 1873). Presidents of the directory were:The data till 1914 follow Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 80\\\\. . * 1871: , pr√©sident du directoire of the √âglise de la Confession d'Augsbourg de France (since 1850), resigned ** 1871‚Äì1872: , per pro * 1872‚Äì1886: ), titled Pr√§sident des Direktoriums * 1885‚Äì1903: Christian Fr√©d√©ric Petri (aka Christian Friedrich Petri), Pr√§sident des Direktoriums * 1903‚Äì1914: , Pr√§sident des Direktoriums * 1914‚Äì1920: Johann Freiherr von der Goltz (aka Hans von der Goltz; 1864‚Äì1941),Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 185. .

Ellis as a young man, holding a Portuguese guitar. Herbert J. Ellis (4 July 1865 - 13 October 1903) was a banjo player, a mandolinist, guitar player and a composer. Music historian Philip J. Bone called him \\"without question the most fertile English composer and arranger for mandolin and guitar.\\" He was the author of a banjo method, a guitar method, and a Tutor for Mandolin (1892), which he wrote while still in school. Ellis was born in Dulwich, London, the son of a licensed victualler, and received no musical instruction beyond that given by his mother, who had been a pupil of Sir Julius Benedict; she taught her son the piano and harmony. He became the delighted owner of a banjo as a boy and said that, \\"Having the infatuation (for the banjo), I learnt several tunes out of my piano tutor, and then occurred to me the idea of writing my own music for it. Gradually growing ambitious, I did not rest until I had written an instruction book, which, in due course saw the light and without being egotistical, I think I can safely say that it was from the advent of my Thorough school that the banjo began to be popular.\\" His parents had planned a business career for him, but after his banjo method was published (by J. A. Turner, London), he was well positioned as an author and composer. He wrote for the banjo during a growing popularity for the instrument in 1884 and onwards. When the mandolin and guitar began to grow popular as well, he added these instruments, about 1888. The demand for his compositions and methods grew and thousands of copies sold, as well as sheet music. His mandolin method was the first printed in England, and to the general surprise it ran through several editions. Bone credited it with being the preliminary work that helped to establish the instrument's popularity in England. His Thorough school for the guitar found favor amongst teachers and players amidst a guitar revival that followed the banjo and mandolin. Bone said that Ellis's method for the guitar was the simplest and best issued (as of 1914) because of its \\"unique and simple manner of arrangement, by its explicit diagrams and judicious sequence of studies.\\" During the period of his first publications, Ellis taught the instruments as well. His career was cut short in his thirties by his premature death. He died in St. Thomas' Hospital, London. Bone eulogized him and his place in music in England: \\"To him was given the faculty for expressing himself in the simplest and most attractive manner, and his total avoidance of technical difficulties made his compositions of particular attraction to beginners, and his name quite familiar to all English players of these instruments.

Life Rawlinsin was born in the Old Bailey in the parish of St. Sepulchre, London, on 25 March 1681, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson (1647‚Äì1708), and his wife Mary Taylor (died 1725), eldest daughter of Richard Taylor of Turnham Green, Middlesex; Richard Rawlinson was a younger brother. After education under William Day at Cheam, and at Eton College under John Newborough, he matriculated at St John's College, Oxford on 25 February 1699. He left the university in 1701, and studied at the Middle Temple, where he had been entered on 7 January 1696. Rawlinson was called to the bar on 19 May 1705, and then made a tour through England and the Low Countries. Returning to London, he concentrated on municipal law, but succeeded to a large estate on the death of his father in 1708. He resided for some years in Gray's Inn, where his accumulation of books compelled him to sleep in a passage. In 1716 he hired London House, Aldersgate for his library, stacked three deep. Joseph Addison is supposed to have had Rawlinson in mind when (in The Tatler, No. 158) he wrote on Tom Folio, a \\"learned idiot\\". Rawlinson was elected a governor of Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospital in 1706, and of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1712. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 19 February 1713, and of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1724. He married, on 22 September 1724, his servant Amy Frewin, formerly a maid at a coffee-house in Aldersgate Street, and died without issue at London House on 6 August 1725. He was buried in St Botolph's Aldersgate. Collections and associations Rawlinson collected books, manuscripts, and some pictures. He was interested in editions of classical authors, and English history. His sole publication under his own name was a copy of verses in the Oxford University Collection on the death of the Duke of Gloucester in 1700. He was on close terms with Joseph Ames, John Murray the bibliophile, and John Bagford; Michael Maittaire dedicated his Juvenal to him in 1716. Thomas Hearne, a fellow Jacobite, borrowed manuscripts from him: his Aluredi Beverlacensis Annales (1716) was printed from a manuscript in Rawlinson's collection. Rawlinson's collection of printed books, was sold in parts, the first sale beginning on 7 March 1722, the sixteenth and last on 4 March 1734, and each occupying between fifteen and thirty days. Of these sales the first six were arranged for by Rawlinson himself (though the sixth took place after his death), and (according to William Oldisworth's account to Hearne) were linked to losses in the South Sea Bubble; the remainder by his brother Richard. At the last sale (besides 800 printed books) were sold the manuscripts, 1,020 in number. The auctioneer was Thomas Ballard; catalogues exist. The pictures, including a crayon portrait of the collector by his brother Richard, were sold by Ballard at the Two Golden Balls, Hart Street, Covent Garden, on 4 and 5 April 1734. Charles Davis was also involved in disposing of the library.

Though Arbeely was popular among the American Colony, he was deemed unacceptable by the Ottoman Empire and within a year was recalled from his position in Jerusalem.  Biography  Born in Damascus, Syria, to Professor Joseph A. Arbeely, Nageeb immigrated with his parents and siblings to the United States in 1878. The Arbeelys were the first Syrian family to seek refuge in the U.S, and as Christians they had been persecuted in the Ottoman Empire. They settled in Tennessee and after completing his studies at Maryville College, Arbeely was appointed there as a professor of French, where he also gave illustrated lectures on the Holy Land. At the age of 24 Arbeely was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as consul to Jerusalem. Though the American Colonists were enthusiastic about his appointment, the Ottoman Empire deemed him unacceptable as a consul, claiming that as Arbeely had been born in Syria, then part of the Ottoman Empire, he could not also serve there as a representative of the United States. It was rumored corruption and bribery, stemming from Selah Merrill whom Arbeely had replaced as consul, were employed in removing Arbeely from his appointment. Arbeely was recalled within a year of his being appointed. Upon his return to the United States, Arbeely was a business promoter for the \\"Streets of Cairo\\" exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893; the 1901 Buffalo World's Fair and the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. He served as an interpreter in the New York City barge office, and later as an inspector in the Bureau of Immigration at the Port of New York. Working with his brother, Dr. Abraham J. Arbeely, they established the first Arabic newspaper published in the United States, the Kawkab America (Star of America). Arbeely later pursued a career in law and was admitted to the New York bar. He was also one of the founders of, and President of, the Syrian Society of New York. He married Marie N. Dilopoulo on September 3, 1892 in Manhattan. In 1904, Arbeely died while in his law office. He was mourned at large among the Syrian community of New York. The funeral was held in the Greek Orthodox Church of Brooklyn.

The Svarth√∂na has since adapted to a northerly climate, but has retained the rare quality of black skin and connective tissue. The current form of Svarth√∂na has been given the status of a landrace. All Swedish entries in gene banks can be traced to a group of chickens that came to Sweden around the turn of the 19th century. In the year 1956 this flock was bought by two brothers in Bullarebygd. The Swedish Association for Landrace BreedsSamarbetsgruppen Lantrasforum has preserved the Svarth√∂na in a gene bank since 1991. A rooster can weigh up to 2 kg, whilst hens do not exceed 1.5 kg. The eggs are small (38-48 g) with a large yolk. Svarth√∂na have some flight ability.

The test is named after Walter Brackett Lancaster, who introduced it in 1939. __TOC__  Test procedure  The patient wears red-green glasses, and two lights (one red, one green) are used, so that the patient thus sees each light with a different eye. One light is held by the clinician, the other by the patient. The clinician points the light to a screen, requesting the patient to bring the second light to align on top of it. The patient's eye positions are measured while the patient performs the test. Advantageously, monocular occlusion is applied before the test for at least 30 minutes. This largely eliminates the neurologically learned fusional vergence tone (\\"vergence adaptation\\") that is present in patients who are able to achieve fusion in a limited area of gaze, as is often the case for patients with incomitant strabismus.  Scope  The Lancaster red-green test quantifies comitant and incomitant misalignments. It accurately assesses horizontal and vertical misalignments (heterotropia, heterophoria) as well as torsional misalignments (cyclotropia, cyclophoria) in all nine diagnostic gaze positions. (Comitancy means that there is the same misalignment in all gaze directions. Incomitant misalignment, that is, a different misalignment of the eyes in different gaze directions, is typically present in patients with paralytic, mechanical or restrictive strabismus.An Orderly Approach to Assessing Strabismus, eyetubeOD (downloaded 23 July 2013) The test allows to determine and accurately quantify also latent forms of strabism heterophoria).

Atalia Omer, University of Chicago Press, 2019 antisemitic conspiracy theorist and white supremacist who is known for his activism on behalf of the alt-right movement in 2016 and 2017.    Spencer calls for the reconstitution of the European Union into a white racial empire, which he believes will replace the diverse European ethnic identities with one homogeneous \\"white identity\\". The majority of European nations have banned Spencer and denounced his call for white racial empire. Poland in particular has repeatedly sought to ban Spencer from Europe, citing Spencer's Nazi rhetoric and the Nazis' genocide of Slavic people during World War II. Spencer is known for his public advocacy of violence against nonwhites. He has advocated for the enslavement of Haitians by whites, the ethnic cleansing of racial minorities from the United States, and the ethnic cleansing of Turks from Anatolia. On the subject of neo-Nazism, Spencer has expressed admiration for the political tactics of American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell.  * * He was a featured speaker at the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, among other neo-Nazi rallies that Spencer has headlined. Spencer's public persona was defined by his repeated, public use of Nazi rhetoric. In early 2016, Spencer was filmed giving the Nazi salute in a karaoke bar, and leaked footage also depicts Spencer giving the Sieg Heil salute to his supporters during the August 2017 Charlottesville rally. After Donald Trump was elected President, Spencer urged his supporters to \\"party like it's 1933,\\" the year Hitler came to power in Germany. In the weeks following, Spencer quoted Nazi propaganda and denounced Jews. At a conference Spencer held celebrating the election, Spencer cried: \\"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\\"; subsequently Mike Enoch led a number of Spencer's supporters in performing a Nazi salute and a chant similar to the chant. In early-to-mid 2017, when Spencer's following was at its height, his supporters would reportedly give him the Sieg Heil salute when he entered a room.Andrew Marantz (2019). Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of the American Conversation, pp. 330‚Äì331 Spencer has been involved in several legal issues. After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, during which an alt-right supporter drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring at least 19 others, Spencer was sued for allegedly acting as a \\"gang boss\\" and inciting the killing. Three supporters of Spencer were charged with attempted homicide following his October 2017 speech at the University of Florida. In court, Spencer was accused of repeatedly physically abusing his ex-wife Nina Kouprianova, who has provided hours of recordings and text messages to the press in order to substantiate her allegations. Court documents detailed emotional abuse and violent physical abuse, including when Kouprianova was 9 months pregnant, and frequently in front of their children. Spencer denies all allegations against him. On June 22, 2020, the federal magistrate judge presiding over a civil rights lawsuit which stemmed from the violence at the Unite the Right rally in 2017, allowed Spencer's lawyer, John DiNucci to withdraw from the case, on the grounds that Spencer owed DiNucci a significant amount in legal fees, and also was not cooperating with him in preparing the case. Spencer will represent himself. At the time of DiNucci's withdrawal, Spencer also faced a $500 fine and two weeks in a county jail in Montana if he does not pay over $60,000 he owes to the guardian ad litem representing his children's interests in Spencer's ongoing divorce proceedings there.Associated Press (June 22, 2020) \\"White Nationalist Richard Spencer Loses Lawyer in Lawsuit\\" U.S. News and World Report Early life Richard Bertrand Spencer was born in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of ophthalmologist Rand Spencer and Sherry Spencer (n√©e Dickenhorst), the heiress to cotton farms in Louisiana. He grew up in Preston Hollow, Dallas, Texas. Spencer attended St. Mark's School of Texas, then Colgate University for one year before transferring to the University of Virginia. In 2001, he received a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Music from the University of Virginia and, in 2003, a Master of Arts in the Humanities from the University of Chicago. From the summer of 2005 into 2006, Spencer attended Vienna International Summer University. From 2005 to 2007, he was a PhD student in Modern European intellectual history at Duke University. He joined the Duke Conservative Union, where he met future President Trump's senior policy advisor Stephen Miller. His former website says he did not complete his PhD at Duke in order \\"to pursue a life of thought-crime\\". Activities = Early activities = From March to December 2007, Spencer was the assistant editor at The American Conservative magazine. According to founding editor Scott McConnell, he was fired from The American Conservative because his views were considered too extreme. From January 2008 to December 2009, he served as the executive editor of Taki's Magazine, a libertarian online magazine published by Taki Theodoracopulos. He has claimed credit for coining the term alt-right in 2008 in order to differentiate himself from \\"mainstream American conservatism\\", although Paul Gottfried argues that both he and Spencer created the term. In March 2010, Spencer founded AlternativeRight.com, a website he edited until 2012. In January 2011, he became the owner and executive director of Washington Summit Publishers. In January 2011, Spencer became president and director of the National Policy Institute (NPI), a white supremacist think tank based in Virginia. George Hawley, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Alabama, has described NPI as \\"rather obscure and marginalized\\" until Spencer became its president. Spencer was invited to speak at Vanderbilt University in 2010 and Providence College in 2011 by Youth for Western Civilization. In 2012, he founded Radix Journal as a biannual publication of Washington Summit Publishers. Contributions have included articles by Kevin B. MacDonald, Alex Kurtagiƒá, and Samuel T. Francis. He also hosts a weekly podcast, \\"Vanguard Radio.\\" In 2014, Spencer was deported from Budapest, Hungary. Under terms of the Schengen Agreement, he was banned for three years from 26 countries in Europe after trying to organize the National Policy Institute Conference, a conference for white nationalists. = Alt Right leader = On January 15, 2017, the day of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, Spencer launched the AltRight Corporation and its website altright.com, another commentary website for alt-right members. According to Spencer, the site is a populist and big tent site for members of the alt- right. Swedish publisher Daniel Friberg of Arktos Media is co-founder and European editor of the site. The Southern Poverty Law Center of the United States describes the common thread among contributors as antisemitism, rather than white nationalism or white supremacy in general. Contributors to AltRight.com have included Henrik Palmgren and Jared Taylor. On February 23, 2017, Spencer was removed from the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he was giving statements to the press. A CPAC spokesman said he was removed from the event because other members found him \\"repugnant\\".White nationalist protesters clash with police during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia On May 13, 2017, he led a torch-lit protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, against the vote of the city council to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. Spencer led the crowd in chants of \\"You will not replace us\\" and \\"Blood and soil\\". Michael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, called the protest \\"horrific\\", and stated that it was either \\"profoundly ignorant\\" or intended to instill fear among minorities \\"in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK\\". In August 2017, Spencer was listed as an organizer on posters promoting the Charlottesville, Virginia, Unite the Right rally. It attracted counter-protesters, and violence broke out. One rightist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one woman and wounding 30 so severely they needed treatment at hospital.nbc29.com: \\"ADL Lists Kessler, Other 'Unite The Right' Speakers as White Supremacists\\", July 25, 2017 In November 2017, Twitter removed from Spencer's account the blue checkmark that, reported The Washington Post, \\"the company gives to prominent accounts to help readers ensure they are authentic\\". Spencer told The Post he was worried this would lead to Twitter banning people like him. He later joined the social network Gab. In November 2019, Milo Yiannopolous released an audio recording allegedly of Spencer using racist slurs immediately after the 2017 Unite the Right rally. Spencer said he did not recall making the remarks, but did not deny the voice on the recording was his. On the tape, Spencer is heard saying \\"Little fucking kikes. They get ruled by people like me. Little fucking octaroons. My ancestors fucking enslaved those little pieces of fucking shit.\\" =Public speaking= Short clip of Spencer speaking in November 2016 During a speech which Spencer gave in mid-November 2016 at an alt-right conference that was attended by approximately 200 people in Washington, D.C., Spencer quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German and denounced Jews. Audience members cheered and gave the Nazi salute when he said, \\"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\\" and extended his right arm with a glass to toast that victory. Spencer later defended their conduct, stating that the Nazi salute was given in a spirit of \\"irony and exuberance\\". It was later revealed that Spencer had given the Nazi salute at a karaoke bar in April 2016. Additionally, in 2017 Spencer reportedly pressured followers to give him the Sieg Heil salute when he entered a room. Leaked texts between Spencer and Eli Mosley indicate that those who refused to give the Nazi salute to Spencer, such as Jason Kessler, were stigmatized within the movement. Groups and events which Spencer has spoken to include the Property and Freedom Society,Southern Poverty Law Center, \\"PayPal Co-Founder Peter Thiel to Address White Nationalist-Friendly \\"Property and Freedom Society\\" Conference in September\\", June 9, 2016. the American Renaissance conference, and the HL Mencken Club. In November 2016, an online petition to prevent Spencer from speaking at Texas A&M; University on December 6, 2016, was signed by thousands of students, employees, and alumni. A protest and a university-organized counter-event were held to coincide with Spencer's event.Richard Spencer speaking about The ‚ÄúAlternative Right‚Äù in America in 2010 ‚Äì video by Property and Freedom Society On January 20, 2017, Spencer attended the inauguration of Donald Trump. As he was giving an impromptu interview on a nearby street afterwards, a masked man punched Spencer in the face, then fled. A video of the incident was posted online, leading to divergent views on whether the attack was appropriate. Shortly after the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, the University of Florida denied Spencer's request for a September 2017 speaking opportunity, citing public safety grounds after opposition from students and locals of Gainesville, Florida. Due to safety reasons, he was also denied speaking requests at Louisiana State University and Michigan State University in August 2017. In September 2017, Cameron Padgett, who tried to book Spencer, sued MSU; he was represented by Kyle Bristow, an MSU alumnus. On August 16, during a television interview with Israeli Channel 2 anchor Danny Kushmaro, Spencer claimed that \\"Jews are vastly over-represented in... 'the establishment', that is, Ivy League educated people who really determine policy\\". Viewing Israel as an exclusionary ethnic state, he described his political position as \\"a white Zionist\\", who wants white people \\"to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves\\". Spencer has repeatedly used this argument over the years in speeches and interviews. Spencer's National Policy Institute, David Duke, Stefan Molyneux, and American Renaissance magazine were among the white nationalist outlets banned by YouTube from their platform in late June 2020 for not following the platform's policies on hate speech.  Public response  =Speech at the University of Florida= After the University of Florida's August 2017 denial of Spencer's request to speak the following month, Floridian lawyer Gary Edinger threatened to sue the university for violating the First Amendment by prohibiting Spencer from speaking despite being a publicly funded institution. The university subsequently reached an agreement with Edinger allowing Spencer to speak on October 19, 2017. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Alachua County on October 16, saying: \\"I find that the threat of a potential emergency is imminent\\" as a result of Spencer's appearance. On October 19, 2017, Spencer spoke at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on university grounds. In addition to Spencer, the speakers included Eli Mosley of Identity Evropa, a white supremacist group from California, and Mike Enoch, a white nationalist blogger.\\"'Go home, racist!' Richard Spencer shouted down at University of Florida speech\\", USA Today The event's security costs reportedly amounted to an estimated $600,000.\\"White supremacist Richard Spencer faces barrage of protest at Florida speech\\", The Guardian\\" It drew about 2,500 protestors, vastly outnumbering Spencer's supporters.\\"Richard Spencer Shouted Down in Florida, Cuts his Speech Short\\", Newsweek\\"Behind-scenes logistics at protest let officers control chaos\\", The Gainesville Sun The speech, which was Spencer's first public appearance after the Charlottesville rally, was disrupted by loud protests. When drowned out by chants from the audience, he grew visibly frustrated, stating that the protestors were interfering with his freedom of speech. He added: \\"You are all engaged in what's known as the heckler's veto.\\" According to Clay Calvert, director of the Marion B. Brechner First Amendment Project at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, non-violent protesting, booing and suggesting that the speaker leave was not a heckler's veto in law. The speech and the concurrent protests were largely peaceful.\\"Richard Spencer UF speech\\", The News-Press Later that day, three of Spencer's supporters were arrested on felony charges following an alleged discharge of a firearm, directed at protestors leaving the event. The three suspects were residents of Texas who had travelled to Florida to hear Spencer speak. According to the Gainesville Police Department, they had shouted \\"Hail Hitler\\" and gave Nazi salutes immediately before the alleged attack. Authorities said that two of the suspects had known links to extremist groups.\\"3 Men Arrested After Shooting at Richard Spencer's University of Florida Speech\\", Time The men had participated in the August 2017 Unite the Right rally, where Spencer had been scheduled to speak.\\"Three Texas Men Arrested Following Richard Spencer's University Speech\\", Anti-Defamation League blog All three were charged with attempted homicide.Deborah Strange, Three supporters of white nationalist Richard Spencer arrested after shot fired at Florida venue, Gainesville Sun (October 20, 2017). In the aftermath of the October 19 events, Ohio State University declined Spencer's request to allow him to speak on campus, citing \\"substantial risk to public safety\\". In response, a lawyer representing Spencer's associate and organizer of his speaking tour filed a lawsuit against the university. =Opposition in Montana= The National Policy Institute think tank, AlternativeRight.com, and Radix Journal all use the same mailing address in Whitefish, Montana. In 2013, a dispute with neoconservative lobbyist Randy Scheunemann at Whitefish Mountain Resort in Montana drew public attention to Spencer and his political views. In 2014, a pro-tolerance group affiliated with the Montana Human Rights Network rallied against Spencer's residency in Whitefish. In response, the city council approved a non- discrimination resolution. In December 2016, Republican Representative Ryan Zinke, Republican Senator Steve Daines, Democratic Senator Jon Tester, Democratic Governor Steve Bullock and Republican Attorney General Tim Fox condemned a neo-Nazi march that had been planned for January 2017. The community of Whitefish organized in opposition to the event, and the march never occurred. Also in December 2016, Spencer announced he was considering an independent run for Montana's at-large congressional district in the 2017 special election, although he ultimately did not enter the race. = European Union bans = European governments and media have responded to his visits. During his speaking tour in Hungary in 2014, Spencer was mocked by the Hungarian newspaper for his call for \\"a white Imperium\\" through a revival of the Roman Empire, and for his claim to be a \\"racial European\\", ideas that the newspaper called contrived and without any basis in European history. In the aftermath of his visit, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n pressed through legislative measures which banned his entry and condemned Spencer. The government of Poland has also banned him from entering the country and condemned Spencer, citing his Nazi rhetoric, the anti-Polish and anti-Slavic racism of the Nazis, and the Nazis' genocide of Slavic during World War II. In July 2018, Spencer was detained at Keflav√≠k Airport in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland en route to Sweden and was ordered by Polish officials to return to the United States; the successful effort of the Poles to ban Spencer from other parts of Europe arises from the Schengen Agreement. Views =White identity= Spencer believes in white pride and the unification of a pan-European \\"white race\\" in a \\"potential racial empire\\" resembling the Roman Empire. In an interview with CNN, he was criticized for an apparent inconsistency or lack of clarity in his definition of white, with his interviewer saying that Spencer defined Syrians as white in the context of Steve Jobs's role in developing the iPhone, but described them as a non-white presence in Europe in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis. In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League called Spencer a \\"leader\\" in white supremacist circles, and said that after leaving The American Conservative, he rejected conservatism, because he believed its adherents \\"can't or won't represent explicitly white interests\\". While being interviewed by David Pakman, he was asked if he would condemn the Ku Klux Klan and Adolf Hitler, he refused by saying: \\"I'm not going to play this game\\", while stating that Hitler had \\"done things that I think are despicable\\", without elaborating on which things he was referring to. Spencer also admires George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, for using \\"shock as a positive means to an end\\". In a 2016 interview for Time magazine, Spencer said he rejected white supremacy and the slavery of nonwhites, preferring to establish America as a white ethnostate. He also advocates the creation of a white ethnostate in Europe that would be open to all \\"racial Europeans\\". Jason Wilson in The Guardian has argued that Spencer and other white nationalists are appropriating some elements of socialist rhetoric to critique a \\"notion of capitalism centered on stereotypes of Jews\\". According to political scientist Tamir Bar-On, Spencer defends \\"racialist and anti- Semitic agendas\\" of the Old Right under a new metapolitical guise, acting as a cultural influencer rather than a direct political actor, and using various media outlets to \\"disseminate his views to ordinary people in an accessible manner\\". =Ethno-nationalism= According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Spencer has advocated for a white homeland for a \\"dispossessed white race\\", and called for \\"peaceful ethnic cleansing\\" to halt the \\"deconstruction\\" of what he describes as \\"white culture\\". To this end he has supported what he has called \\"the creation of a White Ethno-State on the North American continent\\", an \\"ideal\\" that he has regarded as a \\"reconstitution of the Roman Empire\\". Prior to the UK vote to leave the EU, Spencer expressed support for the multi- national bloc \\"as a potential racial empire\\" and an alternative to \\"American hegemony\\", stating that he has \\"always been highly skeptical of so-called 'Euro-Skeptics'\\". = Nazi rhetoric = Spencer has been made frequent use of Nazi rhetoric in his public speeches. He called Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election \\"the victory of will\\", a phrase evoking the title of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), a Nazi-era propaganda film. Spencer urged his supporters to \\"party like it's 1933,\\" the year Hitler came to power in Germany. In the weeks following, Spencer quoted Nazi propaganda and denounced Jews. At a conference Spencer held celebrating Trump's election, he mentioned the \\"mainstream media\\" in those terms: \\"or perhaps we should refer to them in the original German: L√ºgenpresse\\", meaning 'lying press' or 'press of lies', a term frequently used by Joseph Goebbels in Nazi propaganda. Spencer ended his speech with: \\"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\\", and a number of his supporters gave the Nazi salute and chanted in a similar fashion to the chant. =Donald Trump and Joe Biden= Spencer supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Following Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist and senior counselor, Spencer said Bannon would be in \\"the best possible position\\" to influence policy. In November 2018, however, Spencer told his followers \\"The Trump moment is over, and it's time for us to move on.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that, around the same time, the white nationalist movement as a whole was dissatisfied with Trump's presidency. In a July 2019 interview he said he believed Trump was practicing a \\"con game\\" by issuing \\"racist tweets\\" instead of developing a white nationalist agenda. In 2020, following the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, Spencer said that he \\"deeply regretted\\" voting for Trump.} In August of that year, Spencer said that he planned to vote for Joe Biden and the straight Democratic ticket in the November election, calling Trump \\"an obvious disaster\\". The Biden campaign renounced his support.}} =Gender roles= During the 2016 United States presidential election, Spencer tweeted that women should not be allowed to make foreign policy. He also stated in an interview with The Washington Post that his vision of America as a white ethnostate includes women returning to traditional roles as childbearers and homemakers. In October 2017, when asked his opinion on American women having the right to vote, he said: \\"I don't necessarily think that that's a great thing\\" after stating that he was \\"not terribly excited\\" about voting in general. Spencer opposes same-sex marriage, which he has described as \\"unnatural\\" and a \\"non-issue\\", commenting that \\"very few gay men will find the idea of monogamy to their liking\\". Despite his opposition to same-sex marriage, Spencer barred people with anti-gay views from the National Policy Institute's annual conference in 2015. =Health care= Spencer supports legal access to abortion, in part because he believes it would reduce the number of black and Hispanic people, which he says would be a \\"great boon\\" to white people. Spencer also supports a national single- payer health care system because he believes it would benefit white people. =Christianity= Spencer is an atheist, although he also believes that the Christian church previously held some pragmatic value, because Spencer believes that it helped unify the white population of Europe. He opposes traditional Christian values as a moral code, due to the fact that Christianity is a universalizing religion, rather than an ethnic religion. Spencer references his views on Christianity as being influenced by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Citing Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism, Scott Galupo writing for The Week, Sean Illing for Vox, and Jordan Harris for The Courier-Journal have described Spencer's interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy as incorrect. Spencer's Radix Journal has promoted paganism, running titles such as \\"Why I am a pagan\\". Spencer has also described himself as a \\"cultural Christian\\". =Geopolitics= Spencer states he voted for Democrat John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W. Bush during the 2004 United States presidential election, because Bush stood for \\"the war\\". Spencer criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. In January 2020, Spencer tweeted: \\"To the people of Iran, there are millions of Americans who do not want war, who do not hate you, and who respect your nation and its history. After our traitorous elite is brought to justice, we hope to achieve peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness.\\" Spencer praised Israel's Jewish nation-state law, saying: \\"Jews are, once again, at the vanguard, rethinking politics and sovereignty for the future, showing a path forward for Europeans.\\" Spencer has advocated for the US pulling out of NATO, and called Russia the \\"sole white power in the world\\". His former partner, Nina Kouprianova, under her pen name Nina Byzantina referred to herself as a \\"Kremlin troll leader\\" and regularly aligned to Kremlin talking points, with ties to Aleksandr Dugin, a far-right ultranationalist Russian leader in the Eurasianism movement and writer of Foundations of Geopolitics. The webzine founded by Spencer in 2010, called Alternative Right, accepted direct contributor pieces from Dugin. Kouprianova has translated several books written by Dugin. The books were later published by Spencer's publishing house, Washington Summit Publishers. = Libertarianism = In the late 2000s, Spencer was involved in the libertarian movement, supporting libertarian Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and hosting him at his discussion club, the Robert Taft Club. Spencer later disavowed libertarianism as incompatible with white nationalism, and in 2017 he came into conflict with libertarians after reportedly attempting to \\"crash\\" an International Students for Liberty conference.  Influences  According to political scientist Tamir Bar-On, \\"Spencer's key intellectual influences are largely those thinkers concerned with winning the 'cultural war' against egalitarianism, liberal democracy, capitalism, socialism, and multiculturalism,\\" citing Nietzsche, the German Conservative Revolution (including Carl Schmitt, Ernst J√ºnger, and Martin Heidegger), French New Right theorists like Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye, along with other far-right figures such as Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey, Aleksandr Dugin, and \\"US right-wingers with a penchant for race-driven politics or anti-Semitism\\" like Sam Francis, Jared Taylor, and Kevin B. MacDonald. Personal life In 2010, Spencer moved to Whitefish, Montana. He says he splits his time between Whitefish and Arlington, Virginia, although he has said he has lived in Whitefish for over 10 years and considers it home. As of 2017, Spencer was renting an apartment in Alexandria, Virginia. He moved out in August 2018. Prior to his marriage, Spencer's dating history included Asian women, which he has said predates his white nationalism, though this evaluation is disputed. Spencer married Nina Kouprianova in 2010, with whom he has two children. He separated from Kouprianova, a Russian-Canadian with Georgian roots,Richard Spencer's Russian Wife Talks Trump, Utopia: Full Interview By Diana Bruk ‚Ä¢ 09/19/17 in October 2016; in April 2017, Spencer said he and his wife were not separated and were still together.

It experiences some of the roughest seas in winter and is a former harbour. History The harbour dated back to the time of Henry VIII until a storm led to the complete destruction of the pier head and later the whole pier wall in 1887. Parts of the old formation stones can be seen at low tide. As well as evidence of a counter pier. The only evidence visible at all times is the lyme kiln. The old Customs House has been a hotel since 1886 and its former stables are now 'The Wrecker's Retreat' bar. The former corn and hay lofts are now hotel bedrooms. In 'The Wrecker's Retreat' are displayed memorabilia charting the history of Hartland Quay as well as displays of shipwrecks on the coast over the centuries.

The ship was named for Ashland, a port community. The wreckage remains at the bottom of the bay, close to the ship‚Ä≤s namesake city. History City of Ashland was built in 1883 and owned by the Superior Lumber Company, located in Ashland. The ship primarily was used for timber rafting. As timber was harvested around the Bad River area of Wisconsin, the logs would collect near the shore, where City of Ashland would pick them up and tow them in rafts to the sawmill in Ashland. The ship was a common sight around the Chequamegon Bay area. On August 8, 1887, City of Ashland was returning to Ashland while pulling a raft of logs. At a point about three nautical miles (5.5 km) northeast of Washburn, Wisconsin, a fire was discovered at the rear of the pilothouse. The entire ship was engulfed in flames within minutes. Hundreds of people lined the shore to view the emergency. As the flames quickly began to consume almost the entire ship, the crew had no choice but to jump into the cold water of Lake Superior. Several ships came to their rescue, including Cyclone and S. B. Barker. Most of her crew survived, but crewman Fred Ebert drowned. The origin of the fire remains a mystery.

The Flora of Peru program In 1921, Macbride joined the staff of the Department of Botany at Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, to head the nascent Flora of Peru program. Peru had been selected as the center of floristic research by C. F. Millspaugh, the Museum's first Curator of Botany. In 1922, Macbride and his assistant William Featherstone embarked on the first of two expeditions to Peru. They initially collected in the highland regions of the Departments of Lima, Jun√≠n, Hu√°nuco, and Pasco. Macbride returned the following year to the Hu√°nuco region and the R√≠o Ucayali. For a decade from 1929, Macbride visited Europe to photograph specimens of tropical American flora preserved in herbaria, accumulating photographs of over 40,000 specimens. These photographs were to prove of particular importance, as many of the specimens held in German herbaria were later destroyed in the Allied bombing campaigns of World War II. Expeditions to Peru continued in his absence, and by 1936 the Field Museum's herbarium held over 33,000 Peruvian plant specimens, the largest such collection in the world.http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&id;=2007 The Flora of Peru Publication of the Flora of Peru began in 1936, and continued for another 24 years.

It is located in the city centre, but the location was a quiet quarter of Tehran when the palace was erected. History The property in which the Marble Palace is situated used to belong to Prince Abbas Mirza Farman Farmaian, and contained his private residences and office. Upon ascension to the throne, Reza Shah, whom had previously been a sentry guard at the property confiscated it from the Farmanfarmaian family and evicted the family of Abbas Mirza Farman Farmaian in less than 24 hours. The demolition of the earlier buildings took place shortly thereafter. The Marble Palace was built between 1934 and 1937. It was constructed on the orders of Reza Shah by French engineer Joseph Leon and Iranian architect Fat'hollah Firdaws. It was originally built to host official functions and receptions. It was used by Reza Shah and then his son Mohammad Reza Shah as their residence. Reza Shah and his fourth spouse Esmat Dowlatshahi lived at the palace with their five children until Reza Shah's exile in 1941. Reza Shah signed his letter of abdication at the palace in September 1941. The palace hosted significant royal events during the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. It was one of his two significant palaces in addition to Golestan Palace. The palace was identified with the Shah's persona in the 1950s. The palace hosted all three marriage ceremonies of the Shah. The Iranian wedding ceremony of the Shah and his first spouse, Princess Fawzia, was held at the palace in 1939. It was their residence until their divorce in 1945. In October 1950, the betrothal ceremony and in February 1951, the wedding ceremony of the Shah and his second spouse, Soraya Esfendiary, were held at the palace. Both betrothal and marriage of the Shah to his third wife, Farah Diba, also occurred at the palace. Shahnaz Pahlavi, daughter of the Shah and Princess Fawzia, also wed Ardeshir Zahedi at the palace in October 1957. In addition, the palace hosted the Shah's 48th birthday party. Besides these events the Shah also survived an assassination attempt at the palace on 10 April 1965, perpetrated by an Iranian soldier. Following this event the palace was no longer in use and was made a museum in 1970. Style and technical features The image of Marble Palace on 100 rials banknote The design of the two story palace was first developed by Ostad Jafar Khan. However, final sketch was produced by Ostad Haidar Khan. The overall architectural style of the palace is eclectic, combining Eastern, including Qajar architectural features, and Western architectural styles. The palace is surrounded by a garden. The external surface of the palace is of white marble. The stone entrance of the palace where two statues of Achaemenid soldiers holding arrows were erected particularly reflects eclectic architectural style. These statues were carved by Iranian artist Jafar Khan. The palace has other gates which were made by local craftsmen from different provinces. The palace is covered by a huge dome that is a replica of the Sheikh Lotfollah mosque in Isfahan. The dome is covered by arabesque tiles with scroll-like patterns. The internal area of the palace is highly formal with heavily carved doors and extremely high ceilings. The palace has a very large reception room where mirrors are used like in many mosques and holy shrines in the country. The room is known as \\"Hall of Mirrors\\". The interior of the palace was furnished by rich fabrics and rugs. Decorations were made by Iranian architect Hossein Lorzadeh. The tiles used at the palace were produced by Ostad Yazdi and paintings by Ostad Behzad. The land area of the palace is , of which is used for residence. Current usage After the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, the palace was used as a museum until 1981. Then it was given to the expediency discernment council. Local people reported that the palace had been used by the senior politicians in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The historical items used at the palace, including furniture, are being exhibited at the decorative arts museum in Tehran.

Her only surviving work is the autobiographical acrostic poem \\"En annan ny visa\\" (\\"Another New Song,\\" 1651). \\"En annan ny visa\\" The poem \\"En annan ny visa\\" is constructed of twenty-nine stanzas of eight lines each. Birchenbaum's full name is spelled out in acrostic form by the first letters of the stanzas. The poem's style is reminiscent of Finnish folk poetry. The only surviving copy of \\"En annan ny visa\\", dated 24 July 1651, is preserved in the Diocese Library in Link√∂ping. According to the poem, Birchenbaum was born in Karelia; her father died when she was three. She met her future husband early in life. Marrying him for love, she followed him to Germany for the Thirty Years' War. Learning from a message that he had disappeared in the war, she traveled across the country looking for him, and eventually gave him up for dead. After seventeen years alone, in which she kept \\"all worldly joy and pleasure\\" out of her mind, she married again, this time to a young nobleman. However, the marriage was an unhappy one, due to \\"false friends\\" and local gossip that drove the couple apart. Birchenbaum concludes the poem by saying that she is alone in the world once again, and is saying goodbye to it. Personal life Very little is known of Birchenbaum's life other than the account given in \\"En annan ny visa\\". Two other documents survive relating to Birchenbaum; they are petitions dating from the late 1660s, featuring her testimony that she was the widow of Major Axel Paulj Liljenfeldt, who died in the Thirty Years' War while serving in the Swedish army. Birchenbaum was a contemporary (though a younger one) of the Finnish poet Sigfridus Aronus Forsius. Legacy Birchenbaum and \\"En annan ny visa\\" were forgotten until the mid-nineteenth century, when the poem was rediscovered by the antiquarian Per Hanselli. It was first published in 1896. Before the authorship was established, the poem was attributed to a seventeenth-century Swedish poet, Lars Wivallius. Birchenbaum is the first known female writer from Finland. (Maria Simointyt√§r, whose poems were published anonymously in broadside form, was likely the first published Finnish female writer.) Birchenbaum was also the first known Finnish poet to write in the Swedish language. She is additionally notable in that \\"En annan ny visa\\" is the only firsthand literary account of Finland's participation fighting under Sweden in the Thirty Years' War.

In April 2000, USAS founded the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), an independent monitoring organization that investigates labor conditions in factories that produce collegiate apparel all over the world. The WRC exacts an annual membership fee from participating universities, which is used to fund its monitoring work. The WRC works with NGOs, human rights groups, and local labor unions or federations, in countries where collegiate apparel is produced. At present over 180 universities and colleges have affiliated with the WRC. USAS is also proposing that universities sign on to the Designated Suppliers Program, or DSP, which would act to source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages. In 2000, Nike and other major clothing corporations renamed the Apparel Industry Partnership (AIP) the Fair Labor Association (FLA), in large part to compete with the WRC. The AIP, an initiative of the Clinton Administration, had become a discredited organization, because all non-profit organizations and unions that had initially supported it, withdrew from it, with the exception of the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), who subsequently withdrew their institutional membership on the FLA Board soon afterwards. United Students Against Sweatshops is widely viewed as the largest anti- sweatshop community group in the United States and Canada. It was formed in 1997 as part of a broader anti-sweatshop movement increasingly popular in North America. This movement exhibited a great degree of skepticism of free trade practices, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA). Focusing on domestic as well as international sweatshops, the group has built coalitions of students, labor groups, workers, and community members that focus on a range of campaigns: *requesting that Russell Brands Athletic Brand significantly alter its labor policies in Central AmericaBrand Responsibility Project Records 2004-2012.0.84 cubic feet (2 boxes) of textual materials plus 83.8 GB of digital files. *campaigning to get Nike, Inc. to pay severance pay to workers in Honduras laid off by subcontractors *supporting an anti-sweatshop policy called the Designated Suppliers Program, which would source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages *supporting the Coalition of Immokalee Workers' campaign against Taco Bell to win higher wages for farm laborers (\\"Boot the Bell\\") *protesting sweatshop working conditions at New Balance in New York and Forever 21 in San Francisco *living wage campaigns for campus workers *organizing student labor solidarity groups in high schools *protesting Coca-Cola's repression of union organizers in Colombia *supporting labor campaigns in local communities *increased minimum wage campaigns in several states and localities *protesting against Jessica Matthews, board member of Hanes and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in relation to sweatshop conditions for Hanes workers in the Dominican Republic.

He was the son of Gofraid ua √çmair and great-grandson of √çmar, making him one of the U√≠ √çmair. He ruled Northumbria in 943 and 944, either with, or in opposition to, Olaf Cuaran. Ragnall and Olaf were driven out of Northumbria by the English in 944. His later life is unknown but it is possible he was the \\"king of the Danes\\" who is reported as being killed by the Saxons at York in 944 or 945. Biography Ragnall first appears in the historical record in 943. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that that year, Olaf Cuaran was baptised, with Edmund I, King of the English as sponsor, and that same year \\"after a fairly big interval\\" Ragnall was confirmed with Edmund as sponsor.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 943, text D Both Olaf and Ragnall are called king, but it is uncertain whether they were co-rulers or rival kings. Alex Woolf has suggested that the rivalry between Olaf and Ragnall may have been encouraged by Edmund for his own benefit.Downham, pp. 111‚Äì112 There exists coinage featuring the name of Ragnall and coinage featuring the name of Olaf, suggesting both ruled at York for a time.Costambeys There also exists coinage featuring the name of an otherwise unknown Sitric, who may have co-rule Northumbria with Olaf before Ragnall arrived. If Ragnall arrived in late 943 this may explain why the confirmation ceremony with Edmund was arranged. Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum records that in 943 Olaf Cuaran was driven out of Northumbria by the Northumbrians. However, all texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle state that both Olaf and Ragnall were driven out in 944 by King Edmund. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Olaf was only driven out of York in 943, and continued to contest Ragnall for Northumbria until the following year. An account by the chronicler √Üthelweard relates that it was Wulfstan, Archbishop of York and an unnamed ealdorman of Mercia who drove out Ragnall and Olaf and forced them to submit to Edmund. Ragnall's life after 944 is not known with any certainty, although the Annals of Clonmacnoise report in 944 or 945 that \\"the king of the Danes was killed by the Saxons at York\\". This individual might be Ragnall but the account gives no name.Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.aa. 944-945 Family Ragnall's father is identifiable as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 921 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. In the annals Gofraid is identified by the use of \\"ua √çmair\\", meaning \\"grandson of √çmar\\", but never with a patronymic. As such, it is not possible to identify which of the three known sons of √çmar (B√°rid, Sichfrith or Sitriuc) ‚Äì if any ‚Äì was the father of Gofraid. √çmar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the U√≠ √çmair and was one of the earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.Downham, p. 34 Three other individuals are identifiable as sons of Gofraid. Albann was killed in battle against Muirchertach mac N√©ill in 926. Amla√≠b, King of Dublin and Northumbria, was another son, as was Bl√°caire, King of Dublin from 940‚Äì945, and again from 947-948.Downham, pp. 111‚Äì112, 238, 248, 253 An individual identified as Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals may have been Ragnall's son, though no name is given.Downham, p. 64 In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week he was killed by Matud√°n, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king.Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 942; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 942 The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.Downham, p. 64; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 942 =Family tree= Notes References =Citations= =Primary sources=  Accessed via Internet Archive. * Accessed via Internet Archive. = Secondary sources = * * Subscription or UK public library membership required. * External links * CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork.

Life John Phillpotts was the eldest son of John Phillpotts (1743-1814), a Herefordshire landowner, businessman and sometime Land Agent to the Dean and Chapter of Gloucester Cathedral, and his wife Sibella Glover (1753-1833); he was the elder brother of Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter.A Phillpotts Genealogy, unpublished manuscript, Percy Phillpotts, c.1910 John Phillpotts was born at Bridgwater in Somerset while his father was operating a brick and tile factory in that town. John Phillpotts practised as an attorney in Gloucester and held the post of Registrar to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral. He was Mayor of Gloucester for one term (1819‚Äì20). He dined at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1822, after which he served as a magistrate at the Gloucester sessions and on the Oxford circuit.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832, editor D.R. Fisher, Cambridge University Press, 2009 Phillpotts gained a reputation for severity and was known in some quarters as \\"Cat-o-Nine-Tails Jack\\". Flogging was his favoured cure for vagrancy and begging. John Phillpotts was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester in three parliaments (1830‚Äì1831, 1832‚Äì1834, and 1837‚Äì1847). In the 1841 election he topped the poll with 753 votes, being trailed by Captain Maurice Berkeley (732 votes) and Viscount Loftus (510 votes).The Gentleman's Magazine, June 1949 John Phillpotts retired from politics in 1847. In his politics Phillpotts aligned himself variously with the Whigs and the Tories, earning himself the sobriquet of ‚Äúthe Gloucester Weathercock‚Äù, but he was consistent in representing the interests of Gloucester city. Amongst other achievements he backed the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal project, helped develop the infrastructure of Gloucester city and was instrumental in saving a local bank from ruin. In 1797 John Phillpotts married Sarah, daughter of Thomas Chandler of Ashcroft House, Ozleworth, near Wotton under Edge in Gloucestershire. The couple had one son, Thomas Phillpotts (1807-1890), who was to become Canon of Truro under John Phillpotts' brother Henry Phillpotts the Bishop of Exeter. John and Sarah Phillpotts were later estranged. Two years after retiring from politics, in June 1849, John Phillpotts died of a heart attack while on board an omnibus in the West End of London. Sarah Phillpotts died in Gloucester one month later.

Examples of this include using a school or a university as barracks or bases, for offensive or defensive deployments, for storage of weapons or ammunition, for military training of soldiers, as observation posts, and as a detention facility. The United Nations Security Council has encouraged all \\"Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups.\\" According to the UN Secretary- General: \\"The use of schools for military purposes puts children at risk of attack and hampers children‚Äôs right to education... Such use of schools not only results in reduced enrolment and high drop out rates, especially among girls, but also may lead to schools being considered legitimate targets for attack.\\"  Countries and groups involved in military use of schools  According to the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, between 2005 and 2015 there were instances of military use of schools in Afghanistan, Burma/Myanmar, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, Yemen and Zimbabwe. The 2016 UN Secretary- General‚Äôs Children and Armed Conflict report documented military use of schools in 14 countries by at least 10 national armed forces and multiple armed groups. According to the report, the following groups used schools for military purposes during 2015: Afghan National Defence and Security Forces as well as the Taliban and an ISIL-affiliated group in Afghanistan; former S√©l√©ka factions in the Central African Republic; the Colombian military and the FARC- EP in Colombia; the Congolese armed forces and armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Iraqi security forces and ISIL in Iraq; the Darnah Mujahideen Shura Council in Libya; armed groups in Mali; the Tatmadaw (government armed forces) in Myanmar; the Nigerian security forces and Boko Haram in Nigeria; the Armed Forces of the Philippines and paramilitary groups, and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in the Philippines; the Somali National Army in Somalia; the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Army and other government forces and the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition in South Sudan; government forces in Syria; Houthi forces, popular committees, and unknown armed groups in Yemen.\\"Report of the Secretary- General: Children and Armed Conflict,\\" 20 April 2016, United Nations General Assembly, Retrieved 06 July 2016.  United Nations Security Council Action  Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1998 in 2011, the Security Council urged \\"parties to armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede children‚Äôs access to education,\\" and requested that the UN Secretary-General \\"monitor and report ... on the military use of schools ... in contravention of international humanitarian law...\\". Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2143 in 2014, the Security Council expressed \\"deep concern at the military use of schools in contravention of applicable international law, recognizing that such use may render schools legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering children's and teacher's safety as well as children's education.\\" Further, the Security Council urged \\"all parties to armed conflict to respect the civilian character of schools in accordance with international humanitarian law;\\" encouraged \\"Member States to consider concrete measures to deter the use of schools by armed forces and armed non-State groups in contravention of applicable international law;\\" urged \\"Member States to ensure that attacks on schools in contravention of international humanitarian law are investigated and those responsible duly prosecuted;\\" and called \\"upon United Nations country-level task forces to enhance the monitoring and reporting on the military use of schools.\\" In 2015, the Security Council strengthened its language and in Resolution 2225 encouraged all \\"Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups.\\"  Legality  The legality of military use of schools is governed by a combination of international humanitarian law (also known at the \\"law of armed conflict\\"), international human rights law, and domestic law. = International Humanitarian Law = Military use of schools is restricted, but not always prohibited, by international humanitarian law. Parties to an armed conflict are required, to the maximum extent feasible, to a) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas, including where schools and universities are likely to be located; b) endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives; and c) take the other necessary precautions to protect those schools and universities under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations. According to the UN Special Representative to the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict: \\"International humanitarian law prohibits armed forces and groups from using schools while children and teachers are using them for educational purposes.\\"Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, A/68/267, 5 August 2013, para. 16. And according to Human Rights Watch it is \\"unlawful to use a school simultaneously as an armed stronghold and as an educational center.\\" Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, applicable during international armed conflicts, an occupying power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, \\"facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.\\" Under Additional Protocol II, applicable during non- international armed conflicts, it is a \\"fundamental guarantee\\" that children shall receive an education, in keeping with the wishes of their parents. The Roerich Pact states that \\"[E]ducational ‚Ä¶ institutions shall be considered as neutral and as such respected and protected by belligerents ‚Ä¶ The same respect and protection shall be accorded to ‚Ä¶ educational ‚Ä¶ institutions in time of peace as well as in war.\\" = International Human Rights Law = International human rights law guarantees students, teachers, and education staff the right to life, personal liberty, and security. States are also required to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and the development of children. Moreover, everyone has the right to education. With a view to achieving the full realisation of this right, states shall make primary education compulsory and available free to all; secondary education generally available and accessible to all; and higher education equally accessible to all on the basis of capacity. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, states are required to take measures to encourage regular attendance by children at schools and the reduction of child drop-out rates. Explaining the right to education provided for by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the UN's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that \\"There is a strong presumption of impermissibility of any retrogressive measures taken in relation to the right to education‚Ä¶ If any deliberately retrogressive measures are taken, the State party has the burden of proving that they have been introduced after the most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are fully justified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the State party's maximum available resources.\\" The Committee on the Rights of the Child, the body of independent experts who review countries' adherence to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, has responded to evidence of military use of schools by calling for its cessation, the impartial investigation and prosecution of those responsible,; for any damage caused to be promptly and fully restored. and for the prohibition of military use of schools in domestic legislation. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the body of independent experts who review countries‚Äô adherence to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, has also called for the prohibition of occupation of schools by security forces in areas affected by armed conflict, in response to evidence of sexual harassment of girls and school drop-out due to the presence of security forces on school grounds and for the prohibition of military use of schools in domestic legislation. = Domestic Law = Some countries have adopted legislation banning or restricting the military use of schools and/or universities. Some national armed forces and non-state armed groups have banned or regulated the practice, through military manuals or general orders. Meanwhile, domestic courts have also called upon national forces to vacate schools.  Examples of legislation  Argentina's Higher Education Law (1995): \\"Public forces cannot enter the national universities without prior written order from a competent court or a request from the lawfully constituted university authority.\\" Ecuador's Higher Education Law (2010): \\"The campuses of universities and polytechnics are inviolable... When the protection of public forces is needed, the legal representative of the institution will request the relevant assistance‚Ä¶ Those who violate these campuses will be sanctioned in accordance with law.\\" India's Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act (1952): \\"[N]o property or part thereof ‚Ä¶ exclusively used ‚Ä¶ as a school, ‚Ä¶ or for the purpose of accommodation of persons connected with the management of ‚Ä¶ such school, ‚Ä¶ shall be requisitioned.\\" Ireland's Defence Act (1954): \\"Nothing in this section [on military manoeuvres] shall authorize ‚Ä¶ the entry on or interference with (except to the extent of using any road) any ‚Ä¶ school‚Ä¶[or] ground attached to any ‚Ä¶ school‚Ä¶\\" Philippines Act Providing for Stronger Deterrence and Special Protection against Child Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination (1992): \\"Public infrastructure such as schools ‚Ä¶ shall not be utilized for military purposes such as command posts, barracks, detachments, and supply depots‚Ä¶\\" Philippines, Special Protection of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict Act, 2019: \\"Any person found guilty of committing [occupation of schools or disruption of educational activities] ... shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than fourteen (14) years but not more than twenty (20) years and a fine of not less than One million pesos (P 1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00).\\" Poland's Armed Forces of Poland Accommodation Act (1995): \\"The following types of real property are not subject to temporary quartering: ‚Ä¶ real property of institutions of higher education‚Ä¶\\"  Examples of military manuals and orders  Colombia, General Commander of the Military Forces order of 6 July 2010: \\"Considering International Humanitarian Law norms, it is considered a clear violation of the Principle of Distinction and the Principle of Precaution in attacks and, therefore a serious fault, the fact that a commander occupies or allows the occupation by his troops, of ‚Ä¶ public institutions such as education establishments‚Ä¶\\" New Zealand, Manual of Armed Forces Law, 2019: \\"[New Zealand Defence Forces] commanders are to take all practicable steps to protect the right of children to have an education. Use and occupation of schools and other educational institutions obviously inhibits the exercise of this right and is to be avoided wherever possible. Where, for military reasons, it is necessary for the force to use such an institution, for example for accommodating personnel, storage of materiel or as part of a defensive position, all feasible steps must be taken, in consultation with local authorities, to ensure that the disruption to the education of children is reduced as much as practicable. This may include identifying and facilitating the use of other suitable facilities for such purposes‚Ä¶ Members of the NZDF are not to use school buildings or facilities for military purposes unless it is absolutely necessary.\\" Philippines, Armed Forces of the Philippines Letter Directive No. 34, 24 November 2009: \\"To attain this objective, all [Armed Forces of the Philippines] personnel shall strictly abide and respect the following: ‚Ä¶ Basic infrastructure such as schools ... shall not be utilized for military purposes such as command posts, barracks, detachments, and supply depots.\\" South Sudan, Order from Deputy Chief of General Staff for Moral Orientation, 16 April 2012: \\"This act of occupation [of schools by our army] is deplorable and it is [in] violation of our law of land. Besides, you are depriving our children from the much needed education‚Ä¶ I hereby order you to urgently evacuate the ‚Ä¶ schools occupied by the forces under your direct commands‚Ä¶ Failure to evacuate the above mentioned schools will lead to severe disciplinary actions and the act is a serious violation of the law of our land which shall bear regrettable implications‚Ä¶\\" United Kingdom Joint Service Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict (2004): \\"[T]he better view is that the law also prohibits: ‚Ä¶ the use of cultural property for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in armed conflict, unless there is no feasible alternative to such use‚Ä¶ Cultural property includes ‚Ä¶ institutions dedicated to ‚Ä¶ education‚Ä¶\\" United States Field Manual 27-10 (1956): \\"The United States and certain of the American Republics are parties to the so-called [Roerich] Pact, which accords a neutralized and protected status to ‚Ä¶ educational ‚Ä¶ institutions in the event of war between such States.\\"  Examples of court decisions  Constitutional Court of Colombia, Yenys Osuna Montes v. the Mayor of Zambrano Municipality: \\"[T]he city‚Äôs mayor should prevent members of the State security forces from entering the school premises to conduct practices, trainings or to mount weapons, ammunition or deploy armed personnel, as this would increase the danger to the student community.\\" Supreme Court of India, Exploitation of Children in Orphanages in the State of Tamil Nadu v. Union of India and others: \\"[I]t should be ensured that the school buildings and hostels are not allowed to be occupied by the armed or security forces in future for whatsoever purpose‚Ä¶\\"  Practice of non-state armed groups  International humanitarian law binds non-state armed groups that are engaged in an armed conflict. To regulate the conduct of their forces, many such groups issue orders, directives, principles, rules, or make declarations of their intentions to adhere to certain standards. The Free Syrian Army, Syria: \\"[O]ccupation [of schools] by military forces represents a direct violation of domestic and international law‚Ä¶ [T]he Free Syrian Army today states its official position prohibiting the militarization of schools and... and will amend its Proclamation of Principles to reflect the same. This statement will be circulated among all of our battalions and guide the actions of our members. Any individuals found to violate the principles listed in our proclamation will be held accountable, in accordance with international law. - Declaration signed by President of Syrian Opposition Coalition and Chief of Staff of Supreme Military Council, Free Syrian Army, April 30, 2014 National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, Syria: \\"We affirm our responsibility to respect International Humanitarian Law at all times including ‚Ä¶ the responsibilities to ‚Ä¶ [r]espect and protect schools and hospitals, and refrain from using in them in support of the military effort, including by locating military objectives within or near them.\\" ‚Äî National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, Declaration of Commitment on Compliance with IHL and the Facilitation of Humanitarian Assistance, 2014 Thirteen non-state actors have signed the \\"Deed of Commitment for the Protection of Children from the Effects of Armed Conflict\\" developed by the non-governmental organization Geneva Call, which includes the provision: \\" \\"We will ‚Ä¶ avoid using for military purposes schools or premises primarily used by children.\\".

Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict  On 26‚Äì28 November 2012, experts from around the world met at Lucens Castle in Lucens, Switzerland, to discuss developing international guidelines to better protect schools and universities from military use.Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict, The resulting document is known as the Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. The author of the Draft Lucens Guidelines is Professor Steven Haines, Chair of Public International Law in the University of Greenwich in London who served for over 30 years as an officer in the British Armed Forces. Throughout the drafting process, over thirty states and international organizations made public statements in support of the initiative. In June 2014, Norway announced that it would lead the process to finalize the Guidelines and promote their endorsement and implementation. The final Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict were unveiled in December 2014 in Geneva at a meeting organized by Norway and Argentina. The Guidelines urge parties to armed conflict not to use schools and universities for any purpose in support of their military effort. While acknowledging that certain uses would not be contrary to the law of armed conflict, the Guidelines outline concrete measures as a guide to responsible practice for all parties to conflict to avoid impinging on students‚Äô safety and education. A Safe Schools Declaration was developed through consultations led by Norway and Argentina throughout the first half of 2015. The Declaration provides States the opportunity to express broad political support for the protection and continuation of education in armed conflict, and for the implementation of the Guidelines. The Safe Schools Declaration was opened for endorsement at an international conference in Oslo on May 29, 2015. In her 2014 annual report to the UN Human Rights Council, Leila Zerrougui, the Special Representative to the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, welcomed the release of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict and encouraged Member States to adopt them.\\"  References  Category:Children in war Category:Children's rights Category:Youth rights Category:Schools ","title":"Military use of schools"},{"id":"40048390","text":"Kilunda Rugby Football Club, also known as Kilunda or Masaku RFC, is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Machakos.

YTV went on the air in 1968 with Ward Thomas as Managing Director. After only a year of being on air, Ward Thomas had to steer the company through the potentially disastrous collapse of its only broadcasting transmitter on Emley Moor. This left the company facing potential losses of ¬£500,000 per month, but a temporary mast was installed after only four days and a mast bought from Sweden became operational just four weeks later. This swift action limited total losses to only ¬£250,000. =Trident Television & Casinos (1971‚Äî1984)= Trident Television was formed in 1971 as holding company of YTV and Tyne Tees TV (TTTV) with Ward Thomas as Managing Director and Deputy Chairman (becoming chairman in 1976). Anglia Television was also supposed to form part of the group (making up the third spur of the trident) but its inclusion was blocked by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). During this period, Yorkshire produced some of the UK's most successful TV programmes under the stewardship of Head of Programmes Donald Baverstock (1967‚Äì73) and later Paul Fox (1973‚Äì86).\\"THREE DECADES OF YTV - YORKSHIRE TV - 1968-98 - Yorkshire's rollercoaster ride\\".

In 2012, he received the Rhys Jones Medal by the Australian Archaeological Association. Biography Morwood was born in Auckland and grew up in New Zealand. He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts in Archaeology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1973, receiving his Masters in the following year. In 1972 the Auckland University Department of Anthropology awarded him the Anthropology Prize for academic excellence. He commenced further graduate studies in 1976 at the Australian National University. He was awarded his PhD in 1980. His dissertation was titled \\"Art and stone: towards a prehistory of central-western Queensland\\" (Mike Morwood 2010). The majority of Morwood's research was undertaken while he was a member of staff at the University of New England, Armidale. His final post was as Professor at the School of Earth and Environmental Studies, University of Wollongong. Morwood began his career employed as Regional Archaeologist by the Queensland State Archaeology Branch of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs (DAIA) between 1974 and 1976. After receiving his doctorate he returned to the DAIA in Queensland as a Field and Research Archaeologist. In 1981 he began lecturing at the University of New England. As a part of the School of Human Environmental Studies, Morwood lectured in: Australian Archaeology, Southeast Asian and Pacific Archaeology, Rock Art, Archaeological Field Methods, and Archaeological Lab Methods. It was during this time he discovered Homo floresiensis, a hominin species that \\"‚Ä¶prompted reassessment of fundamental tenets in palaeoanthropology ... concerning the peripheral role of Asia in early hominin evolution\\" (Morwood 2011). He initially joined a project by a group of Dutch and Indonesian researchers led by Paul Sondaar (1934-2003), who followed up on discoveries in the 1950s and 60s by Theodor VerhoevenSee: Knepper, Gert M. (2019): Floresmens - Het leven van Theo Verhoeven, missionaris en archeoloog. (Boekscout, Soest, The Netherlands) (= Verhoeven's biography, in Dutch) (1907-1990) on ancient human occupation in Wallacea. Despite bitter complaints by the Dutch scientists, Morwood took over the project.Robert G. Bednarik, Reviewing the Flores Hobbit Chronicles, Anthropos, 2008 In 2003 the excavation team discovered what was to be named a new species, Homo floresiensis in the limestone cave of Liang Bua (first excavated by Verhoeven), on the Indonesian island of Flores. Morwood also produced important work on rock art, most notably his book, Visions of the Past:The archaeology of Australian Aboriginal art. His approach here was to integrate excavated and rock art evidence to produce a rounded interpretation of the past. Morwood moved to the University of Wollongong in 2007 where he was a Professor at the School of Earth and Environmental Studies. His research interests include the archaeology of Southeast Asia and Australia, early hominin evolution and dispersals, the origins of modern humans, rock art, Southeast Asian biogeography, and ethno- archaeology. He took it as a challenge that scientists communicate with public audiences, and in the last decade or so he communicated much of his research to the public. Morwood was elected President of the Australian Rock Art Research Association in 1992, a position he held until 2000. In 2003, he was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities; an organisation dedicated to the advancement of knowledge in humanities. Other professional positions he held include: Professorial Fellow Archaeology in the School of Earth and Environmental Studies at the University of Wollongong, between 2007 and 2013; Adjunct Professorial Fellow at the University of Western Australia between 2009 and 2010; Adjunct Professorial Fellow at the University of New England, from 2009; Adjunct Professorial Fellow at Charles Darwin University, from 2009; and Adjunct Professorial Fellow at Padjadrang University, Bandung, from 2010.  Major accomplishments  Models for the early hominin dispersal out of Africa received considerable attention when the joint Australian- Indonesian research team headed by Morwood discovered Homo floresiensis in the Liang Bua cave on the island of Flores, Indonesia (Morwood & Oosterzee 2007). The finding of Homo floriensis, released on 28 October 2004, has implications for the dispersal of hominin and human dispersal out of Africa, and the colonisation of Asia. It has attracted substantial debate from, in part, supporters of the multi-regionalist theory of Homo sapiens evolution (Morwood). The continued study of Homo floriensis has taken a multidisciplinary approach including palaeanthropological, morphological (see Kaif et al. 2011), and pathological analysis combined with dentition study, ancient DNA extraction and tomographical techniques. Of additional interest to the find are the lithic tools associated with the discovery of Homo floriensis and the cognitive behaviours connected with their manufacture and use (Brumm et al. 2006). Recent research estimates the faunal sequence and minimum age for hominins on Flores at 1.1million years ago, ensuring the study covers the entire period of hominin habitation in the region. Excavations at Mata Menge, Flores, hope to provide greater evidence on the early hominin colonisation of the Indonesian area. The public interest in these hominin finds have sparked numerous documentaries and written works detailing all manner of scientific investigation and discussion on the subject. More recent multinational research projects have identified the interactions of human activity, the local environment, climates and island faunas in long-term changes in Indonesia. The implications for island biogeography and evolution can be seen extending throughout significant periods of time. A collaborative project, with funding from the Australian Research Council, involving Indigenous communities, the University of New England, the Australian National University, the W.A. Department of Environment and Conservation, the Kimberley Foundation and Heliwork, is looking at the complex cultural sequences resulting from human occupation and the impacts on faunal habitation through investigating the distribution, chronology and subject matter of cultural heritage sites. The research being conducted in the Kimberly region of Australia may provide evidence of the effect of environmental and cultural alteration as a result of climate change and human habitation in the area (Professor Michael \\"Mike\\" Morwood 2011). Morwood's innovations in on-site field data recovery include the adaptation of shoring techniques found on industrial construction sites that are well suited for deep excavations. In addition, he developed effective wet-sieving techniques that greatly improved finds recovery from excavated material. He is known for his use of an intelligent database design for recording excavated materials and the documentation of site contexts. Morwood's experience in directing large scale projects has ensured the success of collaborative projects between local Government agencies, research centres and interdisciplinary organisations, both in Australia and Indonesia. As a globally recognized scholar, Morwood is known for his interdisciplinary projects that have embraced various media avenues to promote archaeology to the public. His publications communicate the excitement of archaeological discovery to the wider audience. His scientific research encourages the use of high-profile discoveries to promote archaeology. He is also recognised for his enthusiastic and high-quality training of students and post-doctoral scholars. His former students hold high-level government posts and academic positions throughout Australia and in other countries where he has conducted research. Morwood died on 23 July 2013, in Darwin, Australia, in the company of his wife, Francine and his daughter, Catherine.Archaeologist Mike Morwood, who discovered pre-human 'hobbit' species, dies ABC News, 24 July 2013.

In this work can be seen a departure from the representation of the observable world. The subject is treated neither as a confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but is instead presented in concrete and precise geometric terms. The development of Cubist and abstract art in the work of Gleizes was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with his subject matter. The passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to total abstraction was foreshadowed during his proto-Cubist period. Bords de la Marne measures 54 √ó 65 cm, and is currently in the permanent collection of the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon. History Gleizes' concern for construction, structural rhythms and simplification was dominant even through his short-lived Fauve-like period, when his color brightest and impasto thickest. By treating his subject matter in geometric terms and by modifying curves to become sharp, angled lines, Gleizes consistently held his compositions to the surface of the picture plane. He began to divide the surface into a series of interlocking angles and rectangles of contrasting forms. The overall rose tonality was employed by Gleizes to counter the illusion of depth. In the process Gleizes created some of his first Proto-Cubist works. His awareness of Paul C√©zanne‚Äîeven in the handling of paint‚Äîis evident during this period that lasted roughly from 1907 to 1909, though the process of geometric simplification is more akin to Symbolism, Pont Aven and Les Nabis principles than to C√©zanne. Bords de la Marne and other painting by Gleizes during this phase (e.g., Paysage dans les Pyr√®nees (Landscape in the Pyrenees Mountains), 1908, and Paris, Les Quais, 1908), also bear marked affinity to the work of Henri Le Fauconnier, despite the fact that the two artists had not yet become friends or known about each other's work.Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, 1964 Abbaye de Cr√©teil 1906 : First row- Charles Vildrac, Ren√© Arcos, Albert Gleizes, Henri-Martin Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau. Second row- Georges Duhamel, Berthold Mahn, d'Ot√©mar Though the physical scope and appearance of the world at the time reflected the vast changes in progress, Gleizes expected much more. His vision responded to the conditions of modern life but he did not seek to imitate those conditions, as Gleizes later accused the Futurist artists of doing.Albert Gleizes, Des 'ismes'; vers une Renaissance plastique, Tradition et Cubisme, Paris, Povolovzky, 1927, p. 168 (first published in La Vie des Lettres et des Arts, 1921) Gleizes and his former associates of the Abbaye de Cr√©teil (notably Jules Romains, Henri-Martin Barzun and Ren√© Arcos) dreamed of a synthetic concept of the possibilities of the future, one of collectivity, multiplicity and simultaneity. \\"Their vision\\" writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \\"invariably encompassed broad subjects which, although dealing with reality, were restricted neither by the limitations of physical perception nor by a separation of scientific fact from intellectual meaning‚Äîeven symbolic meaning. Even their images of simultaneity were synthetic because scope was too vast, both physically and symbolically, for one man's limited participation\\". Structural rhythms Gleizes' style changed rapidly between 1905 and 1909. From a paint application technique akin to Impressionism and a palette similar to Neo-Impressionism and Fauvism, his painting became more robust. Color and brushwork became simpler, his structural rhythms more pronounced, though softened by curvilinear forms. A synthetic view of the world‚Äîpresenting the remarkable properties of space, time, multiplicity and diversity‚Äîsuddenly materialized. These paintings were a visual parallel to the ideals verbally realized in the Abbaye de Cr√©teil poetry. :Experienced in the treatment of inclusive landscapes (writes Robbins), he nevertheless had to solve the problem of balancing many simultaneous visions on a painted surface. Gleizes mitigated the distortion of distance by linear perspective, by flattening the picture plane; his skies were on the same plane as the simple flat objects in front and, although scale was retained, a form in the distance would be brought to the foreground by making it bright. Every element of the painting had to be reduced to clear planes, treated as uniformly as possible, for attention lavished on any one part would jeopardize the whole dehcate balance. In 1908, although color range expanded in the winter river scenes and contracted in the summer landscapes, the horizon line consist ently crept higher and higher. Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h, Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands Henri Le Fauconnier, living in Brittany in comparative isolation, was pursuing similar ends. A former student at the Acad√©mie Julian and a friend of Maurice Denis and Les Nabis, he was painting rocks and seascapes in a progressively geometric fashion. He exhibited his seascapes at the 1909 Salon des Ind√©pendants but Gleizes had not yet exhibited in that salon and appears not to have seen the work until they met through Alexandre Mercereau the same year. Mercereau, perhaps, realized the extent of their common interests. Albert Gleizes, 1910, Les Arbres (The Trees), oil on canvas, 41 √ó 27 cm. Reproduced in Du \\"Cubisme\\", 1912 According to Gleizes, Mercereau is also responsible for having introduced him to Jean Metzinger in 1910‚Äîthe same year that Mercereau included these three artists in a Moscow exhibition, probably the first Jack of Diamonds Exhibition. Prior to meeting, Gleizes and Metzinger had been linked by Louis Vauxcelles' disparaging comments on \\"des cubes Blafards\\"Louis Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, March 18, 1910. Quoted in John Golding, Cubism, London, 1959, p. 22. See Toison d'Or, Moscow, 1908, nos. 7-10, p. 15 which likely referred to Metzinger's Portrait of Apollinaire and Gleizes' L'Arbre (The Tree) (1910) at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne in a Russian exhibition of 1908. :\\"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity\\", writes Robbins, \\"it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development\\". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting\\". In 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group‚Äîincluding Allard, Barzun, Beauduin, Castiaux, Jouve, Divoire, Parmentier, Marinetti, Br√¢ncu»ôi, Varlet and even Apollinaire and Salmon‚Äîbecame sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a great Journ√©e portes ouvertes at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of Futurism, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and the Romanian sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953Jean Metzinger, Alexandre Mercereau, Vers et Prose, Paris, no. 27, October‚ÄìDecember, 1911, p. 122Daniel Robbins, From Symbolism to Cubism: The Abbaye of Cr√©teil\\", The Art Journal, 1963-64, XXIII 2. pp. 111-116 Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Ind√©pendants, Apollinaire wrote: > ...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to > discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the > painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the > presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons. This conception is not based on the studies of Picasso and Braque (what became known years later as the analytical Cubism), which had annihilated subject matter almost entirely and confined it to exceedingly flat space. Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay and Fernand L√©ger. The subjects treated by these Cubists differed significantly from the isolated still lifes or figures chosen by Picasso and Braque. Allard wrote of Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Metzinger, in a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne: > Thus is born at the antipodes of impressionism an art which cares little to > imitate the occasional cosmic episode, but which offers to the intelligence > of the spectator the essential elements of a synthesis in time, in all its > pictorial fullness.Roger Allard, Au Salon d'Automne de Paris, L'Art Libre, > Lyon, October‚ÄìNovember, 1910 The development of abstract art in the work of Gleizes and Delaunay was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with epic themes. In order to understand the passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to abstraction, it is important to understand his proto- Cubist period and its differences from the proto-Cubist works of Picasso and Braque. If Bords de la Marne involved the interaction of vast space with geometry, Gleizes' work would soon project speed and action, with simultaneity, commerce, sport, and flight: with the modern city and the ancient country, with boats, the harbor and the bridge and, above all, with time. The dimension of time‚Äîinvolving memory, tradition and accumulated cultural thought‚Äîcreated the reality of the world. \\"In poetry\\", writes Robbins, \\"this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's Real Allegory which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet \\"did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought\\".Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, Du \\"Cubisme\\", published by Eug√®ne Figui√®re, Paris, 1912. The authors begin their work with a discussion of Courbet A departure from the representation of the observable world is quite apparent in Bords de la Marne. This subject was treated neither as a confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise geometric terms. Gleizes' Bords de la Marne is not strictly an anecdotal scene. Rather, it represents a multiple panorama; the analysis of volume relationships in a departure from the grand principles of structure, color and inspiration, a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present.

Another description shows the Rajmahal Area as being composed of the following: Hura, Gilhuria and Jilbari, Chuparbhita, Pachwara and Brahmani. Reserves According to Geological Survey of India reserves of coal as on 1.1.2004 in Rajmahal Coalfield was 13.13 billion tonnes. It was the third highest reserve in Jharkhand, after Jharia Coalfield (19.4 billion tonnes) and North Karanpura Coalfield (14.6 billion tonnes). While Raniganj Coalfield is the major producer of superior quality non-coking coal, Rajmahal is one of the coalfields that has power grade coal at shallow depth (up to 300 m).

Jharia represents the largest coal reserves in India having estimated reserves of 19.4 billion tonnes of coking coal. The coalfield is an important contributor to the local economy, employing much of the local population either directly or indirectly. The fields have suffered a coal bed fire since at least 1916, resulting in 37 millions tons of coal consumed by the fire, and significant ground subsidence and water and air pollution in local communities including the city of Jharia. The resulting pollution has led to a government agency designated for moving local populations, however, little progress has been made in the relocation. Coal field Jharia Coal mine The coal field lies in the Damodar River Valley, and covers about 110 square miles (280 square km), and produces bituminous coal suitable for coke. Most of India's coal comes from Jharia. Jharia coal mines are India's most important storehouse of prime coke coal used in blast furnaces, it consists of 23 large underground and nine large open cast mines.Jharia to be shifted, The Times of India, 31 Aug 2006 History The mining activities in these coalfields started in 1894 and had really intensified in 1925.

It is said to be the most highly located royal castle in Bohemia. Its elevation is above sea level). The castle is in property of the Town of Ka≈°persk√© Hory since 1616. History Ka≈°perk Castle was founded in 1356 by Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia Charles IV to protect Czech borders. Historians and scholars believe the castle was built, primarily, for three reasons. The first was about security. Bohemia needed to bolster their border defense against Bavaria. Secondly, the castle's location was chosen so as to allow for absolute control over the gold-rich region near Ka≈°persk√© Hory. The third reason for building Ka≈°perk Castle was because Ka≈°perk lay in the path of the \\"Golden Route,\\" a trade route that connected Bohemia and Bavaria to the affluent areas of western Europe. A royal castle in name and status, the Ka≈°perk Castle, however, had no royal occupant. The castle was given over to the king's pledge holders. Along with the castle, the occupant of the Ka≈°perk castle also received from the king the authority over administrative and judicial matters in the region of Pr√°che≈à, which encompassed a significant part of southwestern Bohemia. The Ka≈°perk Castle's first pledge holders were the second archbishop of Prague and the first Czech cardinal, Jan Oƒçko of Vla≈°im. From 1411‚Äì1454 Ka≈°perk Castle was in the hands of the house of Zmrzl√≠k of Svoj≈°√≠n and Orl√≠k. The father and son of this house, both named Peter, oversaw a relatively peaceful time in the castle's history. Peter, the father,was a royal moneyer. He and his son were followers of Utraquism, which was also endorsed by the Hussite. It was this allegiance of the Peters that the Hussites never attacked the castle. The younger Peter, on the other hand, made numerous raids on the neighboring catholic Bavaria. During the mid-15th century ownership of the Ka≈°perk Castle passed to the hands of the powerful ≈†ternberkov√© family of ≈†ternberk. The family held immense sway over the region. This powerful and lucrative position in the region made Zdenƒõk of ≈†ternberk ambitious, and in 1465 he led an armed revolt against King George of Podƒõbrady. The Ka≈°perk Castle abruptly became a strategic citadel. With the castle becoming involved in the fighting, the garrison occupying it readied themselves against an onslaught by the king's forces. In order to bolster their defenses, a small fortress was hastily constructed. Ruins situated to the castle's east are believed to be the remains of that fortress, which today is referred to as the Deserted Fort. In July 1940, when the Donau-Zeitung referred to a folklore of three Nornen, the writer alluded to sisters who once lived at the Castle, and cheated the blind one out of her fortune.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 245f Description The central part of the castle consists of two residential towers and an oblong palace which was built between them. Architecture The architecture of the palace was designed to give the castle the utmost security and ability to function as a stronghold. The central part of the castle was built away from the outer walls. To further make the castle resistant to raids, the front walls of the towers, which rise , were kept devoid of openings, except the bay window in the western tower. This design was adopted to make the castle less susceptible to attacks. Location A road runs to within of the castle, where there is a parking. The road to the castle passes through the towns of Ka≈°persk√© Hory and Nezdice. Tourists also have the option to walk to the castle. Several trails branch out from Ka≈°persk√© Hory. Railway lines and bus routes also pass near the castle. The railway station is at Su≈°ice, and buses are available from there to Ka≈°persk√© Hory.

Sir John Richardson Life The third son of Anthony Richardson, a merchant of London, he was born in Copthall Court, Lothbury, on 3 March 1771. He was educated at Harrow School, and matriculated at University College, Oxford on 26 January 1789, graduated B.A. in 1792, taking the same year the Latin verse prize (on the subject Mary Queen of Scots), and proceeded M.A. in 1795. He was admitted in June 1793 a student at Lincoln's Inn. In early life Richardson was closely associated with William Stevens, by whom he was supported while at college. They both worked for the repeal of the penal laws against the Scottish episcopal church. Richardson was an original member of \\"Nobody's Club\\". Sir John and Lady Harriet Richardson (n√©e Harriet Hudson) After practising for some years as a special pleader, Richardson was called to the bar in June 1803. He was counsel for William Cobbett on his trial, 24 May 1804, for printing and publishing libels on the lord-lieutenant of Ireland and other officials, which were in the form of letters signed \\"Juverna\\"; and also in the concurrent civil action of a similar nature brought against him by William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket, the Solicitor General for Ireland. Richardson acted for Cobbett with William Adam. The author of the libel on the Irish officials was an Irish judge, Robert Johnson, justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland); and when he was indicted at Westminster in June of the following year Richardson argued a plea to the jurisdiction, namely that, notwithstanding the Acts of Union 1800, the court of king's bench had no cognisance of offences done by Irishmen in Ireland. The plea was disallowed, Richardson appeared for Johnson in the trial which followed, and the matter ended in a nolle prosequi. About the same time he converting the defence of Henry Delahay Symonds on his trial for libelling John Thomas Troy, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, into an attack on Catholicism. Not long afterwards he was chosen to fill the post of \\"devil\\" to the attorney-general. In 1818 Richardson succeeded Sir Robert Dallas as puisne judge of the court of common pleas, also being made serjeant-at-law. On 3 June 1819 he was knighted by the Prince Regent at Carlton House. His tenure of office was curtailed when poor health compelled his retirement in May 1824. Much of Richardson's later life was spent in Malta, where he edited The Harlequin, or Anglo-Maltese Miscellany, and drafted a code of laws for the island. He died at his house in Bedford Square, London, on 19 March 1841. Richardson had married Harriet Hudson in 1804 in Wanlip. She was the daughter of Charles Grave Hudson, 1st Baronet.The Scots Magazine, Vol 66, 1804 They had five children. Joseph John (1807-1842), who was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1832, Anthony (1808-1829), Sarah Harriet (1809-1907), who married George Augustus Selwyn in 1839, Charles George (1810‚Äì1859) and William Stevens (1815-1861).

The meeting house was founded in its present site in 1662 by the Revd Francis Tallents and the Revd James Bryan, two dissenters ejected from their living at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. It was destroyed by a mob of Jacobite supporters in 1715 but rebuilt the same year. In 1798, Samuel Coleridge accepted the position of minister at the church, (salary ¬£120 a year) and the effect of his first sermon is recorded by the 19-year-old William Hazlitt from Wem. Arriving in Shrewsbury at 8 p.m. on Saturday 13 January, he preached his first sermon on 14 January and with two others on 21 and 28 January, allowing him to leave Shrewsbury on 29 January for Cote House, the home of John Wedgewood at Westbury near Bristol. Coleridge's stay in Shrewsbury was just over two weeks before being offered ¬£150 a year from Thomas Wedgwood to give up his position and study poetry and philosophy. Charles Darwin worshipped at the church until he was eight years of age when his mother died in 1817. The whole building was rebuilt on its present site in 1839-40 by local architect, John Carline, Jnr with money provided by George the First's government. The town plan of 1882 shows it had a small courtyard, which was removed when the High Street was widened, and that it seated 350 people.

Development The film's writer and host of the night Vasay Chaudhry elaborated on the kind of cinema actor-producer Humayun Saeed and his team support. \\"Song, dance and drama is the style of cinema that we believe in,\\" said Chaudhry. \\"From 1947 to 2001, more than 4,300 films were released in Pakistan with dances, songs and drama. This is as much our style of cinema as it is our neighbour‚Äôs.\\" After Chaudhry's brief on the film, film distributor Nadeem Mandviwalla shared his views. \\"On all such jubilant occasions, we should never forget to pay tribute to and thank people like Nadeem Baig and Javed Sheikh who have seen the industry go through thick-and-thin and have been resilient,\\" said Mandviwalla. According to Mandviwalla, Main Hoon Shahid Afridi is expected to do a great job at the local box office. Like every cricket-loving citizen of Pakistan, Saeed also expressed his love for Shahid Afridi and how this film is a tribute to him. \\"I would have easily made a shaadi biyaah type of a film, but I always wanted to pay tribute to one of our own Pakistani stars in their lifetime,\\" said Saeed.\\"Whether he performs or not, Shahid Afridi will continue to be Shahid Afridi for us,\\" said Saeed. He then thanked all the cast and crew for their continuous support and hard work but failed to mention Mathira, who performed an item number in the film. She walked out of the conference in protest. Main Hoon Shahid Afridi also features Javed Sheikh, Nadeem Baig, Shafqat Cheema, Humayun Saeed, Mahnoor Baloch and Noman Habib, who plays the lead role. Shahzad Nasib, who invested $1 million into the film said, Humayun initially had asked the legendary cricketer himself to act in the lead role. \\"They offered me the role but my elders didn't let me act, but I happily gave them permission to use my name as this film will bring a positive message,\\" Shahid Afridi later told AFP.Veteran actor Javed Sheikh talked about his experience in contributing to the new age of Pakistani cinema. \\"I must assure you that Humayun Saeed and his team will bring you a pleasant surprise on the first day of Eid,\\" said Sheikh, who also believes that if Pakistani dramas can beat Indian dramas, then Pakistani films can also beat Indian films. \\"The new wave of Pakistani cinema will come from Karachi and the new film-makers will make better films than India in much more limited circumstances,\\" he added. Senior actor Shafqat Cheema, in his signature aggressive style, explained his character, which is significantly different from the one in Bol. Being one of the most senior cast members, Nadeem Baig said he is hopeful of the new Pakistani cinema, while he grieved over artists going to Bollywood. \\"There is nothing bad about going to Bollywood, but not at the cost of your own cinema,\\" said Baig. \\"Respect your soil and culture because it‚Äôs a part of you and you are a part of it.\\"Director Syed Ali Raza had a more proactive approach towards the new wave of Pakistani cinema. \\"We are not here to compete but to walk hand-in-hand with our neighbours, for the cause of entertainment,\\" he said. \\"Whether you win or lose doesn't matter, but play with such a spirit that you can look into each other‚Äôs eyes after the game,\\" said Raza, using one of the lines from the film. The evening ended with the unveiling of some very catchy songs from the film after which we can easily say that the audience is definitely in for some good surprises. Release The film premiered on 22 August 2013 at Atrium Cinemas in Karachi. It released on 23 August 2013. Reception =Box office= Main Hoon Shahid Afridi earned in its first week of release. Film saw falls from Week Two onward and collected in its Lifetime run and got a verdict of Below Average. =Critical reception= Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of DAWN praised the performances of Saeed and Habib and wrote, \\"The film is family friendly ‚Äì given that one shields the young-one‚Äôs eyes when Mathira belly-dances like an Arab slave-girl\\". Mahwash Badar of The Express Tribune rated it 5 stars out of 5 and said \\"Bravo to the director for knowing the people who will be watching the movie and playing to their emotions, needs and level of understanding; goes to show you that a movie doesn‚Äôt have to be a social revolution, sometimes it just has to be a movie\\", \\"The dialogue was strong, overall acting deserves a round of applause.\\" Momin Ali Munshi of Galaxy Lollywood rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Main Hoon Shahid Afridi is a commercial made to entertain the audience, The music of the film was one of its highlight the Mathira/Mahnoor Baloch item number is without doubt the highlight of the film and it lived up to its hype, The costumes, seductive moves, everything was just mind-blowing\\".

Archaeosortases recognize and remove carboxyl-terminal protein sorting signals about 25 amino acids long from secreted proteins. A genome that encodes one archaeosortase may encode over fifty target proteins. The best characterized archaeosortase target is the Haloferax volcanii S-layer glycoprotein, an extensively modified protein with O-linked glycosylations, N-linked glycosylations, and a large prenyl-derived lipid modification toward the C-terminus. Knockout of the archaeosortase A (artA) gene, or permutation of the motif Pro-Gly-Phe (PGF) to Pro-Phe-Gly in the S-layer glycoprotein, blocks attachment of the lipid moiety as well as blocking removal of the PGF- CTERM protein-sorting domain. Thus archaeosortase appears to be a transpeptidase, like sortase, rather than a simple protease. Archaeosortases are related to exosortases, their uncharacterized counterparts in Gram- negative bacteria. The names of both families of proteins reflect roles analogous to sortases in Gram-positive bacteria, with which they share no sequence homology. The sequences of archaeosortases and exosortases consists mostly of hydrophobic transmembrane helices, which sortases lack. Archaeosortases fall into a number of distinct subtypes, each responsible for recognizing sorting signals with a different signature motif. Archaeosortase A (ArtA) recognizes the PGF-CTERM signal, ArtB recognizes VPXXXP-CTERM, AtrC recognizes PEF-CTERM, and so on; one archaeal genome may encode two different archaeosortase systems. Invariant residues shared by all archaeosortases and exosortases include a Cys and an Arg. Replacement of either destroys catalytic activity, suggesting convergent evolution of the active site with the sortases. In the archaeal model species Haloferax volcanii, archaeosortase A belongs to a fairly large collection of identified membrane-associated proteases, but apparently also to the smaller set of intramembrane cleaving proteases, along with the rhomboid protease RhoII, and in contrast to bacterial sortases.

Barry Hetherington Parker served as a National Science Foundation panelist from 2009 to 2011. He is a senior editor for the journal Production and Operations Management, an associate editor for the journal Management Science and President of the Industry Studies Association. Parker is a member of General Electric‚Äôs Learning Advisory Board, consisting of academics drawn from across Africa, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, that assists in development and broadening of skills across Africa. Parker co-organizes and co-chairs the annual MIT Platform Strategy Summit, an executive meeting on platform-centered economics and management, where he stressed the growth of platforms, their welfare implications and their takeover of government functions. At the same time, he co-chairs an academic meeting, the Platform Strategy Research Symposium. Parker served as chair of the U.S.-Israel Energy Summit in 2014.  Work  Parker has made significant contributions to the field of network economics and strategy as co-developer of the theory of two-sided markets with Marshall Van Alstyne. Parker and Van Alstyne observed that, unlike traditional value chains with cost and revenue on different sides, two-sided networks have cost and revenue on both sides, because the ‚Äúplatform‚Äù has a distinct group of users on each side. Their approach has been described as the ‚Äúchicken and egg‚Äù problem of how to build a platform. They concluded that the problem must be solved by platform owners, typically by cross-subsidizing between groups or even giving away products or services for free. Two-sided network effects can cause markets to concentrate in the hands of a few firms. These properties inform the strategies and antitrust law approaches at all firms involved in the network. His research includes studies of distributed innovation, business platform strategy, and platforms to integrate intermittent energy. Parker is a frequent keynote speaker and advises senior leaders on their organizations‚Äô platform strategies. Before attending MIT, he held positions in engineering and finance at GE.  Publications  Parker's research has appeared in journals such as Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, Energy Economics, Information Systems Research', Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, Management Science, Production and Operations Management, and Strategic Management Journal.

Founded in 1989, Bisnode is owned to 70 percent by Ratos and to 30 percent by Bonnier. Bisnode is present in 19 European countries and has its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. The company's revenue is just under SEK 4 billion.  History  Bisnode traces its roots back to Sveriges Handelskalendar, a trade directory which was founded in 1859 and became the starting pistol for Bonnier's business- information operations. In 1982, Bonnier-owned Aff√§rsdata started publishing business information digitally. In 1986, Bonnier gave tech entrepreneur Lars Save and Bonnier executive H√•kan Ramsin a budget of 15 million SEK to create a business plan for making digital business information services profitable. In 1989, Bisnode's predecessor Bonnier Business Services was founded. During the first half of the 1990s, the company carried out a number of acquisitions of different sizes. It specialized in purchasing problem companies and making them flourish. In 1999, Bonnier's business information was separated from the customer-information operations and named Bonnier Aff√§rsinformation (BAF). In 2005, the private equity company Ratos acquired 70 percent of BAF, who in turn purchased Infodata from Ratos. In 2006, the group was renamed Bisnode. In 2012, under the leadership of the new CEO Lars Pettersson, a major change was set in motion, with the goal to unite all Bisnode-owned companies in Europe under the Bisnode brand. Completed in 2014, Bisnode's 9 400 square-meter head- office building is situated alongside the E4 in Solna.

The intermediate host must ingest the tapeworm's eggs either in food or water-- once this has happened, the eggs hatch and develop into oncospheres which will then burrow through the gut wall of the intermediate host in order to access the organs or tissues of that host where they will continue the next stage of their development as cysticerci or bladderworms. The bladderworm is a cyst created by the oncosphere. In order to become an adult tapeworm, a cysticercus must then be consumed by its definitive host (in either raw or undercooked meat) and establish itself by anchoring in that host's digestive tract. From there, the worm will grow in length and eventually produce proglottids which will exit the intestinal tract with other waste material and then burst, releasing the worm's eggs and completing the cycle.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Barco e Coutada. It is about northwest of Fund√£o. The village, in a fertile river valley settled since Roman times, depends mainly on agriculture and has a declining population. Location and history Barco is on the north bank of the Z√™zere River, which flows between the Serra da Estrela and Serra da Gardunha ranges. The name, which means \\"boat\\", refers to a ferry that operated across the river at this point. The region is fertile and accessible via the river, and has been settled for many years. There are traces of a Roman camp on Mount Argemela, across the river from the town. Tradition says the camp was built to defend against the great Lusitanian warrior Viriathus. Barco is not mentioned in the Inquiri√ß√µes (Inquiries) of 1288, although it is known to have existed at that time. The parish of Barco was established by the 15th century, when it was split off from the priory of St. Silvestre da Covilh√£ and given its own priest. Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint Simon the Zealot. Until the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco. Saint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw. Between 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth. The census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings. By 1950 there were 1,800 people. Since then the population has declined steadily. In 2011 Barco had a population of just 473. Economy and culture Until recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish. The Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco. Economic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction. Most people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye. Local gastronomical specialties include Borelh√µes, sausages, river fish and wild boar. Religion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside. Festivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30). Administration Barco has always been part of Covilh√£. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now . The boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894. From 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco. It was then made a separate parish. In 2013 Barco was again merged with the parish of Coutada to form the parish of Uni√£o das Freguesias de Barco e Coutada.

Dedicated to St Martin, it was founded in 550. The first structure was restored by Alonso el Casto. The present mainly Gothic building was raised with the support of Bishop Lorenzo in 1220. Its local patroness is Saint Euphemia. There is a silver-plated shrine, and others of St Facundus and St Primitivus. The Christ's Chapel (Capilla del Cristo Crucificado) was added in 1567 by Bishop San Francisco Triccio. It contains an image of Christ, which was brought in 1330 from a small church on Cape Finisterre. John the Baptist's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan Bautista) was created in 1468 by the Conde de Benavente. The Portal of Paradise is sculptured and enriched with figures of angels and saints, while the antique cloisters were erected in 1204 by Bishop Ederonio. The Capilla de la Maria Madre was restored in 1722, and connected by the cloisters with the cathedral. The eight canons were called Cardenales, as at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and they alone did services before the altar; this custom was recognised as \\"immemorial\\" by Pope Innocent III, in 1209. The cathedral, which has undergone an impressive transition of architectural styles of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical, was built to a Latin Cross plan. It has been a functional basilica since 1887. The cathedral has a crucifix that is held in great reverence all over Galicia.\\"Catedral de Ourense\\" , OurensEs. Retrieved 24 July 2013. History The earliest cathedral in Ourense appears to have been the church dedicated to Santa Mar√≠a la Madre. In 550, the Suevian king Chararic built a second church dedicated to St Martin of Tours on the site of today's cathedral of the Auriense diocese. It was also the time when the arch bridge opposite the cathedral was built over the river, facilitating access to the thermal springs. The cathedral was however repeatedly destroyed over the centuries by the Moors and the Northmen who invaded the city. Today's building was constructed as a Romanesque church in the 12th and 13th centuries. Construction was supported by Bishop Lorenzo, who also built the new Ourense bridge and the bishop's palace. Gothic additions followed until the early 16th century. There is little historical documentation on the construction of the building but there is a clear record mentioning the consecration of the high altar in 1188.\\"Audioguide Ourense\\", Audioguides Online. Retrieved 23 July 2013.\\" La Catedral de Ourense / Historia\\", Obispado de Ourense. Retrieved 23 July 2013. The cathedral was classified as a national monument in June 1931. Since 1887, it has officially been designated a basilica. Architecture The lantern tower The cathedral plan takes the form of a Latin cross, the nave being flanked by slightly lower lateral aisles. It measures in length and across the transversal transept. Completed in 1505 by Rodrigo de Badajoz, the octagonal Gothic lantern tower with its three levels of windows rises above the point where the transept crosses the nave. The former apse was later converted into an ambulatory bordered by a series of chapels including the 15th-century St John's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan) and the 16th-century Chapel of Snows (Capilla de las Nieves). After the chancel had been demolished in the 20th century, the choir stalls were moved into the body of the church and into Christ's Chapel.\\"La Catedral de Ourense / Recorrido ‚Äì El Cimborrio\\", Obispado de Ourense. Retrieved 23 July 2013. The North Door (Portada Norte), initially of Romanesque design, has a variety of Gothic additions. The tympanum is crowned by a cross where Mary takes possession of Christ's body. Other decorations include an allusion to the miracle of St Martin who is depicted tearing his cloak in two as well as the figure of James the apostle (known as Santiago in Spanish). The turrets on either side of the entrance are no doubt the result of the need to protect the doorway which had been destroyed by Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel in 1471. To the right of the South Door (Portada Sur) which is topped by fine decorations, there is a 16th-century clock tower. The south fa√ßade was initially symmetrical with two defensive towers but the clock tower now looks less imposing. The east gable is flanked by the unfinished 16th-century Tower of St Martin and the 40-metre-tall bell tower which was repaired at the end of the 19th century as it had been damaged by the earthquake which hit Lisbon in 1755. The 16th-century rose window can still be seen. Interior Portico of Paradise The Gothic influence can be clearly seen in the nave with its decorative arches and vaulted ceiling. Repairs and additions have also led to decorations in the Renaissance and Baroque styles in the chapels. The cathedral's main altarpiece in the flamboyant Gothic style is believed to be the work of Cornielles de Holanda with five vertical panels each divided into horizontal compartments. Martin of Tours is depicted in the central panel as the cathedral's patron saint while scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary can be seen in the other panels. On either side of the main altar, there are two other altars representing the martyred saints of Ourense: Facundus, Primitivus and Euphemia. Christ's Chapel (La capilla del Santo Cristo), to the right of the North Door, originally presented the figure of Christ rather than today's altar bearing Our Lady of the Pillar. The chapel owes its origin to Bishop Vasco P√©rez Mari√±o who wished to be buried as close as possible to the figure of Christ. The chapel is decorated in flamboyant Baroque style with a Renaissance screen by Juan Bautista Celma and a canopy by Domingo de Andrade while other decorations are the work of Francisco de Castro Canseco. The Renaissance choir stalls which once stood in the cathedral's chancel were crafted by Diego de Sol√≠s and Juan de Angers. The chapel also contains many other offerings including 18th- century paintings with scenes of Christ's life and the evening meal at Emmaus. Portico of Paradise: coloured figures with an organistrum The 13th-century Portico of Paradise (P√≥rtico del Para√≠so) was built by students of Master Mateo who is best known for his P√≥rtico de la Gloria in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Its three arches are supported by slender columns with a central mullion. The apostle St James or Santiago holds a sword reminiscent of his alleged miraculous participation in the legendary Battle of Clavijo. The original 13th-century figure was replaced in the 19th century. The statue of the Virgin of Consolation (Virgen del Consuelo) with the body of Christ which tops the mullion was also added in the 19th century. Other decorations include Christ being tempted by the devil, a medallion of God the Father and a tabernacle presenting St Martin tearing his cloak. The archivolts of the central arch bear the figures of the 24 elders from the Book of Revelation. The columns themselves are sculpted with apostles and prophets while the capitals present a variety of figures including Christ's temptations in the desert, centaurs fighting mermaids, dragons and harpies with frightening faces who were said to have brought the plague. The vividly coloured pilaster figures were restored in the 18th century from the original Romanesque polychrome. The two Baroque side chapels contain a Castro Canseco altarpiece of the Nursing Madonna and a representation of San Francisco Blanco from Ourense who was crucified in Japan in 1597. Tombs The cathedral was the burial place for several individuals from the 13th to the 15th centuries in chapels of evolving Gothic design. The tomb of Bishop Vasco P√©rez Mari√±o (died 1342) is in the northern transept; Bishop Lorenzo (died mid-12th century) is entombed in the nave of the epistle; Don Alonso Gonz√°lez del Padr√≥n is entombed next to the St Luke's chapel; the tomb of the Infantina, who may have been a Castilian princess, is next to the Capilla de las Nieves; two bishops, including Bishop Quevedo, are also entombed on the wall of the epistle. Museum The cathedral museum is accessed through the Romanesque door leading to the Gothic cloisters known as Claustra Nova. Artifacts include El Incunable de Monterrey, the first book published in Galicia in 1494, Enrique de Arfe's processional cross, 13th-century enamels from Limoges, the so-called Treasure of San Rosendo and the oldest Christian tombstone in Galicia from Ba√±os de Bande.

He was killed at the battle of Big Bethel, and was the first graduate of the United States Military Academy to be killed in the American Civil War. Biography He graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1854, was assigned to the 2nd artillery, and stationed at Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1854 he was made 2nd lieutenant and sent to Tampa, Florida, where he served in the Indian troubles for two years. He was compelled, in consequence of a severe fever, to return home on sick leave, but in the beginning of 1856 resumed his duties, acting part of the time as quartermaster and commissary until December 1856, when he was appointed acting assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics in the U.S. Military Academy, where he remained until September 24, 1860. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on March 3, 1857. He was detailed for active duty at Fort Monroe in late 1860, and rendered efficient service in preventing its seizure. On May 26, 1861, he was sent to Newport News as master of ordnance, superintended the fortifications of that point, and trained the volunteers to artillery practice. When the expedition to Big Bethel was planned, he was unexpectedly detailed to accompany it with two guns, though in his own judgment it was ill-advised. When the Union Army troops were repelled, by his management of the guns he protected them from pursuit and destruction. Just at the close of the action, when he had given the orders to withdraw his guns from the field, he was struck by a rifle ball on the right temple and instantly killed. For his bravery in the two days' action, he was brevetted captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, on the day of his death.Memoir of Lieut.-Col. John T.

She often earns the title of the first female doctor from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. What is known about her life is known from her memoirs, written in 1760, which is a unique example of travel memoir and women's literature. Halpir expressed decidedly un-womanly characteristics and ambitions. Instead of dedicating her life to raising children and being a good wife, as dictated by the 18th- century social norms, Halpir strove to become a successful medical doctor and expressed her hunger for travel and adventure. Names She is known under a great variety of names. Her first name is often given as Salomea, Salome, or Salomƒója. In her memoir, she referred to herself as Salomea, but she signed the dedication as Regina. Her maiden name is rendered as Rusiecki, Rusiecka, Ruseckaitƒó, Rusieckich. Halpir or Halpirowa is her married name from the first marriage. Her name from the second marriage is rendered as Pilstein, Pilsztyn, Pilsztynowa, Pil≈°tyniova, or Pichelstein. Even after bitter divorce from her second husband she continued to use his last name, perhaps because it sounded more noble. In the dedication of her memoir she used the fourth surname ‚Äì Makowska. It has been suggested that it is the surname of her third husband, but the origin of that surname remains unknown. Life and medical career Halpir was born near Navahrudak, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the family of Joachim Rusiecki of petty nobility. At the age of 14 she was married off to a German Lutheran oculist Dr. Jacob Halpir. The couple moved to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dr. Halpir practiced medicine and had many clients while facing cut-throat competition from Jewish and Muslim doctors. Despite, or perhaps because of, her being a poorly educated Christian woman in an Islamic country, Halpir was trained by her husband and assisted him in his operations eventually becoming an accomplished physician herself, with a specialty in cataract surgery. Her status as a female helped her find a niche serving female patients and her status as a foreigner helped her skirt Islamic traditions that severely limited women's freedom. Halpir never received any formal training in medicine. Later, her husband fell ill. He died leaving Halpir with their 2-year-old daughter, Constance. After this, Halpir embarked on an extensive journey throughout Europe. During the Austro-Russian‚ÄìTurkish War (1735‚Äì39), she bought four Austrian prisoners of war. Three of them were ransomed by relatives while the fourth, ensign Pilstein, became her second husband. She traveled to Poland where Micha≈Ç Kazimierz \\"Rybe≈Ñko\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç made her husband an officer and offered her the position of doctor's residence in Nesvizh. Harpin traveled to Saint Petersburg to free some Turkish prisoners of war. There she gained access to the imperial court and met Empress Anna of Russia and future Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After several months she returned to Poland. She divorced her second husband, whom she bore two sons, after she accused him of adultery, attempting to poison her, and extortion. She moved to Vienna where Prince J√≥zsef R√°k√≥czi fell in love with her, but she declined his marriage proposal. Halpir became romantically involved with a Polish nobleman, seven years her junior, who took advantage of her wealth. She also accused him of starving one of her sons to death. She returned to Constantinople and became a physician of the women in the harem of sultan Mustafa III. Until recently, her destiny after 1760, when she completed her memoir, was unknown. Dariusz Ko≈Çodziejczyk has found that in 1763 she was employed as a physician in the Khan‚Äôs harem in Bakhchysarai and as such she served as an informant of the Russian consul Aleksandr Nikiforov. Autobiography The first page of her memoir Halpir's 388-page autobiography was discovered by a Polish historian Glatman in the library of Prince Czartoryski. The memoir was published as Proceder podr√≥≈ºy i ≈ºycia mego awantur (My Life's Travels and Adventures) in Poland in 1957. A number of the events in the memoir seem far-fetched and implausible. For example, she described how her leg became limp and visibly shorter due to a magic omen. Therefore, biographical accuracy of her memoir is disputed and some researchers prefer to treat it more as a work of fiction than factual autobiography.

An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse.Felt, A.

Although the concept was not new, the Android architecture doesn't require elevated privileges to access the components, which makes it an open platform. Activities in Android are defined as classes that control the life cycle of a task in the user interface. The activities supported by an application are declared in a manifest, so that other applications can read what activities are supported. Intents in one application can start particular activities in a different application, if the latter supports the message type of the Intent. An analysis in 2011 by researchers from The University of California at Berkeley found that Intents can pose a security risk, allowing attackers to read content in messages and to insert malicious messages between applications.

By the turn of the century, the company employed about 100 workers and were producing 4000 carriage clocks each month. On the eve of World War I, The Couaillet brothers employed 300 people and their catalog listed 250 models of clocks, but during the war, the focus of production switched to precision mechanical components for fuses, parts for aircraft engines and field telegraph systems. In 1919, after a trip to the United States, he designed and began the production of the ‚Äú√âlectricar‚Äù, a lightweight, three-wheeled, one- person electric automobile. Only 250 units are sold; the market demanded an internal combustion engine. At the same time, he relaunched his horological business, producing primarily alarm clocks and timers.

The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including: * the volume of selected raw material reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used * the lifecycle-long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe * options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources. About the report Metals and their compounds have been used for millennia because of their unique properties. They are used in highly valued products of modern technology, furthermore, they plan an essential role in renewable energy technologies., 2013, International Resource Panel, UNEP After having analyzed issues of metal stocks in society and recycling rates and recycling conditions and opportunities in the previous two reports on metals, Metal Stocks in Society report and Recycling Rates of Metals report, the International Resource Panel decides to address the environmental and energy issues related to the use and the production of metals. In this report, an assessment is made of literature on metal flows and cycles in nature and in society, the way they are connected, and the potential impacted related to them. The four areas of focus are 1) Local impacts of mining, 2) life cycle energy use, 3) non-metal sources, and 4) the need for a final sink. Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore, it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development. The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores.

His work focused on signal intelligence and the history of the National Security Agency. Aid was a graduate of Beloit College (1980). Discovery of National Archives records removal In 2006, Aid, a former member of the Air Force (later a historian) was performing research about the National Archives and learned that 25,515 records had been removed from the National Archives by five agencies, namely the CIA, the Air Force, the Energy Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Archives itself. The story was first published by The New York Times.The Amateur Sleuth Who Gave the Archives a Red Face, The Washington Post, Christopher Lee, 9 June 2006 Court-martial and imprisonment Shortly after interviewing Aid in 2006, Washington Post reporter Christopher Lee learned through a Freedom of Information Act request that Aid had been punished 21 years earlier for unauthorized possession of classified information and impersonating an officer while serving as a staff sergeant in the United States Air Force in the United Kingdom. He was court-martialed for unauthorized possession of classified documents and impersonating an officer, received a bad conduct discharge, and was imprisoned for a year in 1986. Aid responded that the release of his military records to the press was done in retaliation for his discovery of the National Archives records removal, which led to an official investigation and press-attention.

It is an all-boys school in Johor Bahru, Johor. The school is under the royal patronage of the Sultanate of Johor, and it has been awarded the status of Cluster School of Excellence by the Ministry of Education (Malaysia). English College Johore Bahru (EC) is one of the ten oldest English institutions in Malaysia and the oldest school in Johore. History =Beginning= English College was established on 21 March 1914, with 21 students selected from Bukit Zaharah School. The school was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel, while the campus of vocational studies has been replaced by the old Royal Malaysian Customs of Johore. The 21 students were placed under the tutelage of two teachers brought over from England, Morrison and Holman. These 21 students can be regarded as the pioneers, and from this beginning EC became an educational institution in Johor Bahru. The education system of the EC was based on that of the English public school and it adopted the British syllabus, and EC later became a model for other English medium schools in Johor. The teachers of the school were initially recruited from Europe, although later locally trained teachers were used to teach Malay subjects. After end of World War I in 1918, the EC held for the first time its Junior Cambridge examinations, later followed by Senior Cambridge examinations. However, the results for both examinations were poor, and as a consequence the school was closed temporarily in 1928 for reassessment. It reopened in May of the same year, and after remedial actions had been taken by the school administration, the school met its target at the end of 1928. 143 students were selected to study Mathematics, Science and English. Also in 1928, T. Drury, who had been in the Education Service of Malaya since 1921, was appointed the principal of EC. =Relocation= At the end of 1930, the school moved to its present location at Jalan Sungei Chat. Of the original school, only stone blocks and steps are left, which can still be seen at its old site. The new EC was officially opened in early 1931, and the school has since produced many outstanding students. Two of its most famous students are Tun Hussein Onn, who later became the Prime Minister and Tun Musa Hitam, the Deputy Prime Minister. Some of the notable teachers there were Pendeta Za'Ba, T. Drury, T. Grundy, Mr Bion Dury, Hj. Zulkipli Bin Hj. Mahmod, Victor Joshua Jeyaretnam (father of J. B. Jeyaretnam) and Mohamad Bin Iskandar (father of Tun Mahathir Mohamad). During the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1941 to 1945, the EC was used as a military base, a factory, a military hospital, as well as a prison camp by the Japanese. The school reopened in early 1946 after the end of Japanese occupation. H. L. Hill was appointed the Headmaster of EC, and under his leadership, the EC returned to its status of a prestigious school. In 1949, the first group of girls was admitted to the EC. =After Malayan independence= In 1960, following the end of the British rule in Malaya, the name was changed to 'Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar' (MSAB) after Sultan Sir Abu Bakar of Johor who was the Father of Modern Johore. More local teachers were employed to teach at the school. In 1961, the school badge and uniforms were introduced for the first time. This was followed by creation of the school song with lyrics written by Yusof bin Karto set to music by Lim Teck Siang. In 1974, EC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee, and the then Deputy Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn as well as all the former students were invited to the celebration. Also in 1974, the first batch of students of Sekolah Menengah Sains Johor was placed temporarily in the English College until the completion of the school's building in the month of April 1974. During the 1980s and 1990s, the school was further enlarged and facilities were added for student's use in accordance with the requirements of Ministry of Education and the introduction of Integrated Secondary School Curriculum. In 2005 EC recorded the best PMR performance for Johor Bahru when three EC students were selected as national top PMR candidates, namely Joshua Soo Iyn Zhou, Mukeshakumar and Wong Guo Wai and Yong Jenn. EC was confirmed by the Ministry of Education as a Premier school. In 2007, the company won the award for Excellent Crew EC Best Company and Best Service in Young Entrepreneurs Convention 11th. PMR 2007 once again recorded excellent results when an EC students selected as outstanding PMR Johor. On 5 May 2009, the English College was officially selected by the Ministry of Education as a Cluster School of Excellence. EC was selected based on its excellence in various aspects such as the achievement of excellence in the Paralympic Games, excellence in mathematics in the PMR and SPM, excellence in orchestra and rugby team as well as the various programs organised by EC, for example the creation of the Tun Hussein Onn Museum and Visual Arts Gallery EC.

The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's Basic Instinct. In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, \\"I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible.\\" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, \\"I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) ‚Äì also inwards (points to his chest) ‚Äì everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room).\\"No Plane for Zabreb, 2012 film The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white. The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings. Plot As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren‚Äîa documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands‚Äîis seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when \\"anything was possible.\\" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not. We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a \\"Fat Lady\\" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds. From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menag√© Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father‚Äôs death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day. The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, Nema aviona za Zagreb (\\"There is no plane to Zagreb\\" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. \\"What Nema expresses is good will and a great incapacity. Nema and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark.\\" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth. He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use. Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy‚Äôs parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God. First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did. From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ‚Äô60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English. :. . . I make up my mind :Not knowing what my mind is. At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a caf√© in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, \\"a little angel of God.\\" At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film‚Äôs story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film. In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute. The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word \\"nema,\\" as \\"Really and Sincerely\\" by the Bee Gees plays.

Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as \\"a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . .\\" Production Principal photography for Nema began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012). Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for Nema aviona za Zagreb. In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting.Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc., 1986, p. 6528 Van Gasteren told Baba, \\"The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension.\\"Seventy Fourth Family Letter, 1 September 1967, 82 Family Letters, Mani S. Irani, Sheriar Foundation, 1976 The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film. About half of this footage was released in the 1997 documentary, Beyond Words. Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material.Ilja Lammers at Linkedin.com The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010.EYE Film Netherlands - Nema Aviona Za Zagreb Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began.

Written by Clarkson, Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with production by Abraham and Oligee, \\"Hello\\" is a midtempo rock song about searching for companionship in hopes of not being lonely, in which the singer asks, \\"Hello? Is anybody listening?\\" Upon its release, \\"Hello\\" was received with positive reception from music critics, who regarded it as a vocal highlight of Stronger. Boosted by digital sales during the album's release, the song entered the South Korean Singles Chart at number 47. Clarkson has also performed it a limited live performance during her Stronger Tour in 2012.  Release and composition  \\"Hello\\" was written by Kelly Clarkson Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with Abraham and Goldstein (as Ollgee) handling the song's production. During the summer of 2011, Clarkson and McKee had collaborated on tracks such as \\"Hello\\" and \\"Alone\\", intending it to be recorded for Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger, which was released on October of that same year. An acoustic version of the \\"Hello\\" was included as the opening track of her first extended play, The Smoakstack Sessions (2011). Written in the key of E minor, \\"Hello\\" is a midtempo rock song with guitar chords and its hand claps. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing, Clarkson's voice range featured in the song spans from A3 to E5. Jarett Wieselman of omg! Insider noted that its chord progression is similar to Katy Perry's single \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" (2011), a track also written by McKee.  Critical response  \\"Hello\\" has received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described it as \\"a slightly more rugged track that finds its groove in the chorus. The handclaps on the bridge are a nice touch\\" and added that the song \\"is gonna be a killer in concert.\\" Seattle Post- Intelligencers Jason Scott described \\"Hello\\" as a \\"Fun\\" and \\"cool\\" track. He compared it to tracks recorded on All I Ever Wanted (2009) and noted that the track relies \\"solely on the \\"O\\" vowel to tell a story. \\"Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone,\\" Clarkson sings before asking if anybody is listening. We hear you loud and clear!\\" Brian Mansfield of USA Today considered \\"Hello\\" as a vocal highlight of Stronger, he wrote in his review: \\"this rock tune sounds happier than its lyrics, which depict Kelly as feeling alone even when she's not by herself.\\" Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared it to \\"Mr. Know It All\\", and described it as a '90s throwback. He wrote, definitely works, especially with the hooky chorus and heartbroken ferocity of the bridge: \\"Holding onto the memories of when I, I didn't know / Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone.\\" Ryan Pearson of The Huffington Post noted that \\"there is an undertone of loneliness and sadness coursing throughout, including some downbeat lyrics co-written by Clarkson herself. \\"Hello, is anybody listening? Won't somebody show me that I'm not alone,\\" she sings on \\"Hello\\".\\"  Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from the Stronger liner notes.

She was the first lawyer from within the Crown Prosecution Service and the second woman to hold the appointment. She was also the second holder of this office not to be a Queen's Counsel. She was previously the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London. Her term of office ended 31 October 2018. Early life Saunders was born on 14 February 1961 in Aberdeen, Scotland to Hugh Colin Brown and Margaret Bennett Brown. She attended primary school in Brixton, London and St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff. Saunders then studied at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire. She read law at the University of Leeds from 1979 to 1982. She graduated Bachelor of Laws (LLB hons). Career Having completed her pupillage and thereby becoming a qualified barrister, Saunders began working for Lloyd's of London. She joined the newly formed CPS in 1986. In 1991, she joined the CPS policy division. She was appointed Branch Crown Prosecutor for Wood Green in 1997, and Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London South in 1999. She took up the appointment of Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex in 2001 overseeing the case made against Roy Whiting, who was convicted of murdering Sarah Payne. Between 2003 and 2005, she served as Deputy Legal Advisor to the Attorney General. She then became head of prosecutions for the Organised Crime division of the CPS. She was the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London from 2009 until 2013. During that time, she was involved in the 2011 to 2012 retrial, and subsequent conviction, of the killers of Stephen Lawrence. = Director of Public Prosecutions = On 23 July 2013, it was announced that she would become the new Director of Public Prosecutions in succession to Sir Keir Starmer, taking up the appointment on 1 November 2013. She was the first head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be appointed from within the service and the second woman to hold the appointment. As the Director of Public Prosecutions, Saunders has faced criticism and controversy around the handling of trials for rape and sexual assault. The CPS has been criticised for the case of Eleanor de Freitas, who killed herself after the CPS decided to take over a private prosecution brought against her by the man she accused of rape. Saunders said that the \\"evidence in this case was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice\\". Saunders has also stated that the number of rape prosecutions being brought to court will increase by a third in the year 2015 and has argued that this increase follows improvements in the treatment received by victims by police, courts and the CPS. In 2014, Saunders announced the CPS would be seeking to fight against criminals hiding assets abroad and appointed a team of six specialist lawyers to work with legal authorities overseas to recover assets from countries including Spain and the United Arab Emirates. In April 2015, Saunders was criticized for her decision not to prosecute Greville Janner on child sexual abuse charges despite his meeting the evidential test for prosecution, citing his poor health, as well as for dropping charges against nine journalists as part of the Operation Elveden case. Saunders defended herself saying, \\"I‚Äôm not here to make popular decisions. I always feel under pressure to make the right decision.\\" In June 2015, The Guardian reported that, following a review, the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner would in fact be overturned. Simon Danczuk, then MP for Rochdale, told the Guardian that \\"if the report is accurate, Saunders will now have to consider her position\\" as a result of the scrutiny that her initial decision would now be placed under. The decision marks the first time a DPP has had a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. Amid calls for her resignation, she told the BBC that she would not resign. Saunders blamed failings within her department and the police for the collapse of three different police inquiries between 1991 and 2007. Theresa May (then the home secretary, later Prime Minister) said in a radio interview: ‚ÄúI was very concerned when I heard about this decision. It is not my decision, it is entirely a decision for the director of public prosecutions.‚Äù In 2015, a case was brought against Saunders in the High Court. The Plaintiff, Nikki Kenward, argued that Saunders had amended prosecution policy outside of the democratic process. Saunders released the alleged amendment in October, 2014. In it she suggested that the guidelines on assisted suicide prosecution be understood such that a doctor who is not the patient's immediate care provider, should not be as likely to face prosecution as a doctor who is the patient's immediate care provider. This prompted a backlash from anti-assisted suicide groups who argued that this was a substantial change, which would allow for businesses similar to Dignitas to operate in the UK. Saunders' defence was that she had only clarified the existing guidelines. Nevertheless, Kenward was granted the judicial review against Saunders in April, 2015. It went to the High Court in November, 2015 where the case against Saunders was dismissed. As of 2018, Saunders was paid a salary of between ¬£210,000 and ¬£214,999. On 2 April 2018, it was announced that Saunders was to stand down at the end of her term as head of the CPS and on 1 November 2018 she was succeeded as Director of Public Prosecutions by Max Hill QC. =Controversy= In June 2015, Saunders was accused by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer of a crusade to criminalise \\"drunken sexual encounters\\". In December 2017, The Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson called for Saunders to resign following the scandal of several high-profile rape cases falling apart or convictions being overturned due to police withholding key information regarding the innocence of the accused. On 23 January 2018, however, Saunders was criticised by victims and survivors' groups because her words could be taken to mean that silence equates to consent. After it was announced that Saunders would not be reappointed for a second term, The Daily Telegraph also reported in April, 2018 that crime statistics tracking burglary, violent crime and shoplifting all rose significantly under Saunders' tenure ever since she first became Director of Public Prosecutions. On 29 December 2018 The Telegraph reported that Alison Saunders will be \\"the first former head of the Crown Prosecution Service not to receive a senior honour after her tenure was marked by a series of scandals\\". (All of her predecessors \\"became a knight or a dame either during their tenure, or immediately after their departure.\\") A week after she stepped down as head of the CPS, it was announced that the CPS had agreed to a five-figure settlement with broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree and bailed repeatedly for a year over unfounded sex charges before being told he would not be charged. Samuel Armstrong, a former Conservative MP's chief of staff who was acquitted of rape, said the settlement was a \\"damning indictment\\" that \\"should act as the final nail in the coffin for her hopes of a damehood.\\" He added: \\"Saunders' one-woman crusade to shift the scales of justice in sex cases not only ruined the lives of dozens of young men but of Paul Gambaccini as well.\\" =Later career= In 2019 Saunders joined the law firm Linklaters as Dispute Resolution Partner. Personal life Saunders is married to Neil Saunders, a lawyer, and has two sons. Honours Saunders was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2013 New Year Honours \\"for services to Law and Order especially after the 2011 London Riots\\" and Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to criminal justice.

The painting was exhibited in Room 41 at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in the Spring of 1911 (no. 2612); the exhibition that introduced Cubism as a group manifestation to the general public for the first time. The complex collection of geometric masses in restrained colors exhibited in Room 41 created a scandal from which Cubism spread throughout Paris, France, Europe and the rest of the world. It was from the preview of the works by Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, and Fernand L√©ger at the 1911 Ind√©pendants that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. La Femme aux Phlox was again exhibited the following year at the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La Bo√©tie, 1912 (no. 35). La Femme aux Phlox was reproduced in The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations (Les Peintres Cubistes) by Guillaume Apollinaire, published in 1913. The same year, the painting was again revealed to the general public, this time in the United States, at the International Exhibition of Modern Art (The Armory Show), New York, Chicago, and Boston (no. 195). The work is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Gift of the Esther Florence Whinery Goodrich Foundation in 1965.Albert Gleizes, Woman with Phlox, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Description La Femme aux Phlox is an oil on canvas with dimensions 81.6 x 100.2 cm (32.1 by 39.4 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created during the second half of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The window behind the sitter opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior. In 1964 art historian Daniel Robbins writes of La Femme aux Phlox in the catalogue of the Gleizes Retrospective at the New York Guggenheim: > Continuing his new interest in the figure, Gleizes strove to manipulate a > genre subject with the same sobriety and broad scale that had always > informed his landscapes. Thus, exterior nature is here brought into a room > and the distant vista seen through the window is formally resolved with a > corresponding interior shape.Albert Gleizes 1881‚Äì1953, a retrospective > exhibition, Daniel Robbins. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in > collaboration with Mus√©e national d'art moderne, Paris; Museum am Ostwall, > Dortmund, published 1964 Gleizes had sketched figures often enough, but > because his search for a synthetic vision that would reconcile disparate > elements had fostered a natural predilection for landscape, his figure > paintings were few. The Salon des Indep√©ndants, 1910, saw the immediate > influence of Le Fauconnier in Gleizes' large portrait of Ren√© Arcos. In 1910 > both artists continued to concentrate on figures: Le Fauconnier on a > portrait of the poet Paul Castiaux and Gleizes on a majestic portrait of his > uncle, Robert Gleizes. The two works are very close and establish Gleizes' > debt to Le Fauconnier for having stimulated his interest to encompas a new > and important element, the figure. With its highly limited color palette Gleizes achieved in La Femme aux Phlox a masterful demonstration of monochromism,Jean Chauvelin, Nadia Filatoff, John E. Bowlt, Alexandra Exter: monographie, 2003 a relative and paradoxical monochromy,C√©cile Debray, Fran√ßoise Lucbert, La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925, Mus√©es de Ch√¢teauroux ‚Äì 2000 considering the subject matter of a woman with flowers. The subject of Gleizes entries at the 1911 Ind√©pendants are discernible to some extent and to some viewers, while it was claimed that others could see nothing. For Gleizes, the subject (the 'figurative support') is used only as an accessory, hidden under other values that are more specifically important. Gleizes writes in his Souvenirs: > The subject‚Äîwhether treated sentimentally or adapted to the formula of a > gimmick that might be more or less amusing‚Äîthe originality of a Henner, a > Ziem, a Didier-Pouget, even of a Wlaminck‚Äîwas subordinated to true, > essential qualities that correspond to the plastic demands of painting; that > certainly was the basis for the state of mind of this first stage in a > radical change in the position of the painter, the stage that has, > legitimately, the right to the name 'Cubism'. This stage in fact remains > respectful of the classical 'three dimensions', emphasising 'volume'. > Consequently, it remains within the framework of 'perspective', which > suggests on a flat surface an illusion of depth. These are the values which > we wanted forcefully to express and to place above those purely emotional > concerns with which the mentality of painters of that time was satisfied, > leading to a real atrophying of the form which other times had, by contrast, > been able to develop and to exalt.

La Tour rouge. 1911 by Robert Delaunay in his Eiffel Tower series. Art Institute of Chicago. Exhibited at Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1911 This exhibition comprised more than 6,400 artworks. In room 41 were placed the works by Gleizes, L√©ger, Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Archipenko and Laurencin. In room 43 hung works by Andr√© Lhote, Roger de La Fresnaye, Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, Luc-Albert Moreau and Andr√© Mare. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau, who died 2 September 1910. The Cubist contribution to the salon created a controversy in the French Parliament about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such 'barbaric art'. Gleizes was a founder of Cubism, and demonstrates the principles of the movement in this monumental painting (over six feet tall) with its projecting planes and fragmented lines.The Armory Show at 100, Albert Gleizes, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Th√©o Morinaud) The large size of the painting reflects Gleizes's ambition to show it in the large annual salon exhibitions in Paris, where he was able with others of his entourage to bring Cubism to wider audiences.Michael R. Taylor, from Masterpieces from the Philadelphia Museum of Art: Impressionism and Modern Art (2007) The newly formed group who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the caf√©s Le D√¥me, La Coupole, La Closerie des Lilas, Le Select, and Caf√© de la Rotonde) together with other young painters who also wanted to emphasize a research into form (as opposed to color) took over the hanging committee of the Salon des Ind√©pendants ensuring that the works of painters soon to be dubbed 'Cubists' would be shown together. Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, L√©ger and Marie Laurencin (at the request of Apollinaire) were shown together in Room 41.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881‚Äì1953Albert Gleizes, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, 1925 (Translation by Peter Brooke) Albert Gleizes, in his Souvenirs, writes of the importance of taking over the hanging commission of the 1911 Ind√©pendants, so that the works of like-minded artists could be hung together forming a coherent group, i.e., so as not to be scattered to the four corners of the salon where the effect produced on the public by a coherent movement would be lost. The task was difficult. To achieve this, they needed to get into a position of influence. After some political maneuvering and a forceful 'last minute thrust' ['manoeuvre de derni√®re heure'] they succeeded in battering their way through the Committee's routine. Le Fauconnier was unanimously elected as chairman, Gleizes continues: > So we could get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those > who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new > generation. On one side of the central room the rooms would be given to the > older members; on the other, the young painters organised the rooms that had > been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, > Andr√© Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at > this moment that we got to know each other. In the Room 41 we were grouped > together ‚Äì Le Fauconnier, L√©ger, Delaunay, Metzinger and myself, joined, at > the insistence of Guillaume Apollinaire, who was following this organisation > with the greatest interest, by Marie Laurencin Le Fauconnier showed his > great Abondance. L√©ger his nudes in a landscape in which volumes were > treated following the method of differently shaded areas [zones d√©grad√©es] > used in architecture or in mechanical models. Delaunay Le Tour Eiffel and La > Ville. Metzinger [Landscape, Nude, Woman's Head and Still Life], Marie > Laurencin some canvasses with people in them.

In the neighbouring room were to be found, if my > memory is right, Lhote, Segonzac, Moreau. [...] During the few days it took > for the hanging commission to do its work, there was nothing that could have > enabled us to foresee the effect our pictures were about to produce on the > public at large. The painters and critics who walked around the canvasses > were clearly very interested, whether they were for or against. But no-one > could have thought there was material there for a scandal. And we the first, > who certainly never would have wanted it. So we were greatly surprised when, > at the preview, the explosion took place. (Albert Gleizes) \\"The great complaint that was made against us was of being unreadable; people claimed they could 'see' nothing in our pictures\\". Gleizes continues: > Everyone was crushed into our room, people were shouting or laughing, > expressing indignation, protesting, getting up to all sorts of antics, they > were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and > defended our position and those who condemned it argued with each other... > Room 41 was always full. In Intransigeant Guillaume Apollinaire emphasized the importance of what the Cubists were doing and defended them with passion. Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, and L'Oeuvre were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in Paris- Journal, the free spirited poet Andr√© Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism. =The term 'Cubism'= It was from that preview in 1911 that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. Prior to the Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1911 no one had ever been called a Cubist, not even Braque or Picasso. > What, by contrast, can be established is that from 1911 onwards the term > became commonplace and, initially confined as it was to the painters of Room > 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a > distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire > himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, > after this opening at the Ind√©pendants, during an exhibition which we held > at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the > name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In > 1911 the word Cubism was born in the same way as the word 'Impressionism' in > 1872. Overnight, Gleizes, Metzinger, L√©ger and Delaunay had become famous. Virtually unknown the previous evening, their names and profiles were spread not only throughout Paris but throughout France and other countries as well. Gleizes writes: > Painting which, until then, had been the concern of only a small handful of > amateurs, passed into the public domain and everyone wanted to be informed, > to be let into the secret of those paintings which, it seemed, represented > nothing, and whose meaning had to be deciphered like a puzzle. The Armory Show The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, known today as the Armory Show, was a landmark event in the history of art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries. This massive exhibition was presented in varying forms at three venues‚ÄîNew York (69th Regiment Armory, February 17 ‚Äì March 15), Chicago (Art Institute of Chicago, March 24 ‚Äì April 16), and Boston (Copley Society, April 23 ‚Äì May 14). The exhibition introduced the visual language of European modernism to a wide spectrum of the American public, changing the aesthetic outlook for American artists, collectors, critics, galleries and museums. In 1913, Gleizes, along with Archipenko, Picabia, Picasso, the Duchamp brothers and others, introduced Cubism to an American audience at the Armory Show in three major cities, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to La Femme aux PhloxArmory Show entry, Albert Gleizes' painting La Femme aux Phlox, 1910, Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution Gleizes exhibited his 1912 painting Man on a balcony (no. 196 of the catalogue).Catalogue of International Exhibition of Modern Art, Exhibition held at the Armory of the 69th Infantry, New York, from Feb. 15 to March 15, 1913 Gleizes entries‚Äîboth of particular importance, had already produced a considerable effect in Paris‚Äîpractically eclipsed six paintings and a drawing by Picasso, and three paintings by Braque exhibited at the Armory Show.Pierre Cabanne, Pierre Restany, L'Avant-garde au XXe si√®cle, 1969 Exhibitions * Salon des Ind√©pendants, Paris, 1911, no. 2612. * Salon de la Section d'Or, Paris, 1912, no. 35. * International Exhibition of Modern Art (The Armory Show), New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913, no. 195. * Rene Gimpel Galerie, New York, 1937, no. 5. * Passedoit Gallery, New York, 1949, no. 4. * Le Cubisme, Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, 1953, no. 37. * Twentieth Century Masters, Marlborough Gallery, London, 1955, no. 21. * Albert Gleizes, Marlborough Gallery, London, 1956, no. 8. * Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York, 1964 * Albert Gleizes 1881‚Äì1953, a retrospective exhibition, The Solomon R.

Life From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping. Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of \\"Lord Protector\\", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate. Theological views Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect. Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: \\"We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough\\", Richardson notes. Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God‚Äôs work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by ‚Äúfaith‚Äù simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of ‚Äúinterest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ‚Äù. Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification: ‚Äú[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ‚Ä¶yet these are no means of our salvation.‚Äù Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism. Works Richardson wrote: * Newes from Heaven of a Treaty of Peace, or a Cordiall for a Fainting Heart, 1643. * The Life of Faith, in Justification, in Glorification, in Sanctification, in Infirmities, in Times Past, in all Ordinances, 1643. * Some brief Considerations on Dr. Featley his Book, intituled \\"The Dipper Dipt\\", London, February 1646. * Fifty Questions propounded to the Assembly, to answer by the Scriptures whether Corporal Punishment may be inflicted upon such as hold different Opinions on Religion, London, May 1647. * Justification by Christ alone a Fountaine of Life and Comfort, London, June 1647; reprinted in William Cudworth's Christ alone exalted, London, 1745; in this work Richardson refers to an earlier publication, The Saint's Desire, and concluded with separate answers to objections of Pierre Huet and Nathaniel Homes to that work; Richardson's tone is here strongly anti-Arminian. * The Necessity of Toleration in Matters of Religion, London, September 1647; reprinted by the Hanserd Knollys Society in 1846. * An Answer to the London Ministers' Letter from them to His Excellency and his Counsell of War; as also an Answer to John Geree's Book, intituled \\"Might overcoming Right\\", with an Answer to the Book intituled \\"The Armies' Remembrancer\\" ‚Ä¶ also a Discovery of that Learning and Ordination these Ministers have, and the Vanity and Insufficiency thereof ‚Ä¶, London, January 1649. * The Cause of the Poor pleaded, London, 1653; a plea for providing the poor with work. * An Apology for the present Government and Governour, with an Answer to severall Objections against them, and 20 Queries propounded for those who are unsatisfied to consider, London, September, 1654. * Plain Dealing, or the unvailing of the Opposers of the Present Government and Governors, in answer of several Things affirmed by Mr. Vavasor Powell, London, 1656. * A Discourse of the Torments of Hell ‚Ä¶ with many infallible Proofs that there is not to be a Punishment after this Life for any to endure that shall not end, 1658 and 1660; reprinted in The Ph≈ìnix, ii. 427; 4th edit.

Arordiner priests officiating a ceremony at the Temple of Garni. The Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: ’Ä’•’©’°’∂’∏’Ω’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ Hetanosutiwn; a cognate word of \\"Heathenism\\"), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves \\"Hetans\\" (Armenian: ’∞’•’©’°’∂’∏’Ω Hetanos, which means \\"Heathen\\", thus \\"ethnic\\", both of them being loanwords from the Greek ·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ, ethnos) or Arordi, meaning the \\"Children of Ari\\", also rendered as \\"Arordiners\\" in some scholarly publications. The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of Tseghakron (’ë’•’≤’°’Ø÷Ä÷Ö’∂, literally \\"national religion\\") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the Armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the \\"Order of the Children of Ari\\" (Arordineri Ukht). Neopaganism expert Victor Schnirelmann estimated the following of Armenian neopaganism to be \\"no more than a few hundred people\\".\\"Christians! Go home‚Äù: A Revival ofNeo-Paganism between t e Baltic Sea and Transcaucasia (An Overview). Victor A. Schnirelman (2004). Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol 17 No. 2. Page 208 History Garegin Nzhdeh, the ideologue of an Armenian \\"national religion\\". =Nzhdeh's and Kakosyan's experiences= The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \\"Order of the Children of Ari\\" (or \\"Ara\\"; Arordineri Ukht in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936‚Äì2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886‚Äì1955). Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and fedayi of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the \\"prophet of the Armenians\\". Nzhdeh founded a movement named Tseghakron (\\"religion of the nation\\"), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god \\"fighter of the serpent\\", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. During his exile, Slak Kakosyan made extensive use of Nzhdeh's works to codify the Ukhtagirk (\\"Book of Vows\\"), the sacred text of the Armenian Native Faith movement. In the book, Garegin Nzhdeh is deified as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the Aryan values. While still in the United States, Kakosyan claimed that he had been initiated to the ancient Armenian hereditary priesthood mentioned by Moses of Chorene, changing his forename from \\"Edik\\" to \\"Slak\\". He likely became acquainted with Zoroastrian communities in the United States. =1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari= Returning to Armenia in 1991, Slak Kakosyan gathered a community and founded the Children of Ari. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holydays. The Temple of Garni became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites. During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society. According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern Pagan movements, but also Hindu and Protestant movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology. =Republican Party support and grassroots spread= An Arordiner priest. Ashot Navasardyan (1950‚Äì1997) and Andranik Margaryan (1949‚Äì2007), founding fathers of the Republican Party of Armenia, were Arordiners like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni. The Republican Party provided financial support for the Children of Ari until recent times, sponsored the publication of Ukhtagirk and the set up of a memorial stele to Slak Kakosyan on the grounds of the Temple of Garni. Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities. Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, the Children of Ari does not declare a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party. Although it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations, and among the Armenian diaspora. Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from mysticism to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty- five years-old woman who believed to be infertile, and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty. The woman gave her daughter the name \\"Nana\\", another name of the goddess of fertility. Local Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital Yerevan. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005. =2009: Avetisyan and the Armenian Aryan Order= Another party that was closely associated to the Arordiners is the Union of Armenian Aryans, led by Armen Avetisyan, headquartered in Abovyan, a city which is the second most important center of the Armenian Native Faith movement after Yerevan. The relations with the party, known for its extreme views, were cut in 2009 when Avetisyan proclaimed himself a spiritual leader and announced the initiative to build a central temple in Yerevan; as the Children of Ari expressed their opposition to the project, Avetisyan founded a separate religious group, the Armenian Aryan Order. Beliefs =Theology and cosmology= Ar and Ara Beliefs among the individual Arordiners vary, though there is a common theological underpinning provided by Ukhtagirk. This theology is a monism: The beginning of the first section of the book recites that \\"in the beginning was the Ar, and Ara was the creator\\". The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, transcendent principle begetting the universe, while Ara is his personal, present form as \\"the Creator\\". The book continues telling the myth of how Ara generates the gods and how the goddess Anahit gives birth to Ari (Aryan), the form of mankind. According to Arordiner theology, Ar is the life-giving word root, and it is the origin of words like, for instance, art (\\"arable\\", \\"cultivation\\"; culture, art), aryyun (\\"blood\\"), argand (\\"womb\\"), armat (\\"root\\"), arka (\\"king\\"), ara (\\"male\\"), Arev (the Sun), Ara (manifested Ar), Ari (acting with Ar), Chari (opposing Ar). The \\"essence of things\\" and their \\"perfection\\" is represented by swastika motifs. Ari and Chari, and the many deities The different deities are conceived by the supreme Ara. Some Arordiners do not consider them to be separate beings, but as \\"incarnations of different aspects of Ara\\". They are organised in a cosmic duality, representing the \\"light side\\" and the \\"dark side\\" of the universal power, with the latter led by Vishap, the great snake, whom is identified as being the same as Yahweh. The history of mankind itself is seen as a constant struggle between these two forces: One represented by Ari (Aryans), the right men of the creative light side; the other one represented by Chari, destructive dark- sided creatures made from soil by Vishap. The Armenian Native Faith is polytheistic in practice. The gods of the Arordiners include: Hayk, the mythical founder of the Armenian nation, Aray the god of war, Barsamin the god of sky and weather, Aralez the god of the dead, Anahit the goddess of fertility and war, Mihr the solar god, Astghik the goddess of love and beauty, Nuneh the goddess of wisdom, Tir the god of art and inspiration, Tsovinar the goddess of waters, Amanor the god of hospitality, Spandaramet the goddess of death, and Gissaneh the mother goddess of nature. =Afterlife and eschatology= The Arordiners have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the reincarnation of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living. According to Arordiner doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years. The struggle between light and dark forces unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ara, they are not nourished by cosmic energy, and they fall prey of the evil Chari forces. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn manifests again and brings the Ari forces back to life. =The Ukhtagirk= Ukhtagirk, the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \\"Book of Vows\\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005. Kakosyan, however, is not credited as the \\"author\\" of the Ukhtagirk, but rather as the \\"recorder\\" of an eternal truth understood by inspiration, its \\"compiler\\" (kazmogh). The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state. The book is divided into seven parts: ‚ë† Astvatsashoonch (\\"Dictionary\\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root Ar; ‚ë° Tsagumnaran (\\"Genesis\\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; ‚ë¢ Avetaran (\\"Book of Testaments\\") and ‚ë£ Dzonaran (\\"Book of Odes\\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; ‚ë§ Veharan (\\"Book of Greatness\\") and ‚ë• Patgamaran (\\"Book of Commandments\\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, ‚ë¶ Hymnergaran (\\"Book of Hymns\\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge. Chanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the Ukhtagirk. At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth. Practices People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni. Armenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the Ukhtagirk. For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to Mount Khustup, where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn. The priests' aim is to replicate such experience. The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Arordiners. In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including Mount Ararat and Mount Aragats, function as pilgrimage destination for Arordiners. The memory of Slak Kakosyan is also part of the cults celebrated by the Arordiner priests. The celebrations in honour of Vahagn at the Temple of Garni usually start at the memorial monument of Kakosyan, set up after his death on the site where his ashes were dispersed. The figure of Kakosyan has been mythologised in a collection of poems composed by Aren Haykyan and published in 2007. In these poems he is described as a divine man. Haykyan is also the author of poems devoted to Nzhdeh and to the gods. =Rituals= Stage of a knunk ritual. Armenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three rites of passage: The knunk, a complex ritual of initiation; the psak, that is wedding; and death rituals. The death rituals require the cremation of the body, and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the Garni Gorge, and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River. Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch. The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself, at a time when cremation was illegal in Armenia. Later, Arordiners obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead. The Armenian term knunk may be translated as \\"conversion\\" or \\"reversion\\" (to the native way of life). Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each knunk ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many Arordiners who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion. =Temples and idols= Arordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins. The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common. The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement. The Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries. They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of apricot trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock. The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood. Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods. Besides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the Metsamor Castle (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the Erebuni Fortress (eighth century BCE), Shengavit (fourth to second millennium BCE) and Zorats Karer (third millennium BCE), and the mountains. Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists. =Holidays= The Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays: Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, Vardavar and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August. Relations with Christianity A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni. The relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the Armenian Apostolic Church have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared: Similarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared: Armenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution. Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres. According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \\"first genocide of the Armenians\\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century. At the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The Arordiners find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of matagh, Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the Arordiners believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the swastika. Arordiners generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Arordiners in disguise: The catholicoi (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954‚Äì1994) and Garegin I (1995‚Äì1999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the swastika and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.

The tomb is named after the Roman triclinium, a type of formal dining room, which appears in the frescoes of the tomb. It has been described as one of the most famous of all Etruscan tombs. Since its discovery in 1830, the tomb's frescoes have deteriorated and lost some of their color and detail. In 1949 they were moved to the Tarquinia National Museum to conserve them. Thanks to watercolor copies made by Carlo Ruspi shortly after the tomb‚Äôs discovery, it is still possible to see the frescoes in their former state. The artistic quality of the frescoes has been described as superior to many other Etruscan tombs. Description Detail of a barbiton player on the left wall The tomb consists of a single room. The fresco on the back wall shows a banquet scene, borrowed from depictions of drinking scenes on Attic red-figure pottery from the early fifth century. The banqueteers recline on three couches called klinai. On the floor under the klinai a cat prowls towards a rooster and a partridge. On the left wall three female dancers, one male dancer and a male musician with a barbiton appear. They are placed between small trees filled with birds. On the right wall a similar scene is shown. On the entry wall two youths jump down from their horses. They may be apobates or a reference to the Dioscuri as intermediaries between the earthly life and the afterlife. The similarities between the frescoes in the Tomb of the Triclinium and Tomb 5513 (also in the Necropolis of Monterozzi) led Steingraber to conclude that they were the products of the same workshop. The strong influence of red-figure Attic vase painting has convinced some experts that the artist who decorated the tomb was a Greek metic.

It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state.

Early life  Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in M√∂nchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhochschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhochschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia). Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow. Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven. In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello.Lev Aronson, interview by Bob Beers, 1985 (Lev Aronson Musical Score Collection, Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives, The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, NC, USA). As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well- known physician and cellist in Riga.  Between the World Wars  Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931. In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing.Lev Aronson, interview by Robert Beers, 1985 (Lev Aronson Musical Score Collection, Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives, The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, NC, USA). Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia.Aronson personal papers, Lev Aronson Collection, RG 2052 (YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, NY, USA.) He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life.  The Holocaust and its aftermath  German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga.Katrin Reichelt and Martin C. Dean (2012), \\"Riga,\\" in The United States Holocaust Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945: Volume II: Ghettos in German- Occupied Eastern Europe, Martin C. Dean, ed. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), 1020. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents. Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established.Joseph Robert White (2012), \\"Riga-Kaiserwald Main Camp (aka Me≈æaparks),\\" in The United States Holocaust Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933-1945: Volume 1: Early Camps, Youth Camps, and Concentration Camps and Subcamps Under the SS-Business Administration Main Office (WVHA), Geoffrey P. Megargee, ed. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), 1230. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla. In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof. From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was in one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians. Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947. Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin.Copies of the published works and the manuscripts can be found in the Lev Aronson Cello Music Collection of the Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  The United States  Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist.http://libapps.uncg.edu/archon/index.php?p=creators/creator&id;=555 Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979. Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the Chevalier du violoncello by the Janzer Foundation. Impact as a cello teacher Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments.

Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sasanian-dynasty Background In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands.Howard-Johnston (2006), p. 99 Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt. Siege Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sasanian-dynasty Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men,http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-iii-sasanian-king-r besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabƒ´l and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp. Aftermath After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession.

The novel is set in Granada, Spain at the end of the Middle Ages ‚Äî beginning in the summer of 1491. It was originally published in an expensive form, with many engraved illustrations. The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations. Plot In Leila, as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila. The characters meet at the altar of a convent in which Leila is about to take her vows as a nun, and her father kills her. The domestic plot parallels the Christianization of Spain.

The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress. Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters. Early life Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants pp. 1039‚Äì1040 They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who had previously been Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil.King \\"Ranulf (I)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097. Acquisition of lands The modern-day county boundaries of Cumbria (red) within England; Meschin held lands within this area. Meschin was given Gilsland (near Carlisle) by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle in Cumberland. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it.Green Aristocracy of Norman England p. 119 In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont.Sanders English Baronies p. 115 Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton.Sanders English Baronies pp. 142‚Äì143 Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli.Newman Anglo-Norman Nobility pp. 124‚Äì125 Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the Domesday Book.Newman Anglo-Norman Nobility p. 144 footnote 47 Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother. Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen.Pettifer English Castles p. 41 He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory.Green Aristocracy of Norman England p. 404 Katrina Legg, a historian who studied medieval monasticism, argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay,Legg Bolton Priory pp. 3-4 Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121;Knowles, et al.

Death and legacy Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. After the death of Ranulf without heirs, Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold.

At the Benito Juarez Autonomous University in Oaxaca, Guti√©rrez studied classical guitar and his musical interests spread to diverse genres including classical, flamenco, son cubano and jazz.  Career  At age fourteen he began playing classical guitar in restaurants in Oaxaca and caught the attention of German born guitarist Wolfgang ‚ÄúLobo‚Äù Fink of Willie & Lobo. At 17, he teamed up with Fink to play venues in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. When Fink returned to Germany, Guti√©rrez went to Mexico City to study jazz earning money by playing his guitar on city buses. The guitarist has played in South America and Spain with Ana Gabriel, Ricardo Arjona, Francisco Cespedes, and Pedro Guerra. A virtuoso with the nylon string guitar and tres, Guti√©rrez has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Mexican Cultural Institute of the Mexican Embassy in Washington D.C. and to a crowd of 10,000 people at Millennium Park, Chicago. Gutierrez is recognized for his unique ability to connect with the audience and channeling a bit of the local energy into each performance. Guti√©rrez talent was then discovered by Doc Severinsen who heard him play in a restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. Severinsen led the NBC Orchestra for twenty years on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. They recorded their first album together in 2007 called En Mi Corazon. Gutierrez is the band leader, founder and musical director of the group the San Miguel 5 and they have performed with symphony orchestras across the United States. Other musicians of the San Miguel 5 include Grammy award winning violinist Charlie Bisharat, Cuban percussionist Jimmy Branly and bass player Kevin Thomas. In 2011 Gil Guti√©rrez and Doc Severinsen played at New York City's Carnegie Hall accompanied by the New York Pops under the direction of conductor Steven Reineke. Gil Guti√©rrez performs live at Carnegie Hall with Doc Severinsen and Steven ReinekeGuti√©rrez has performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony, Florida Symphony and with the Doc Severinsen Big Band Tour in Dallas, Texas. In 2013 he was the featured artist and directed the ensemble at the Calaca Festival honoring Chavela Vargas in San Miguel de Allende. Constantly pushing boundaries as a musical director he brings together new combinations of musicians and musical styles. These include opera, jazz, cantaor flamenco, Cuban and Mexican styles to create performances considered the cultural vanguard. Among his works are performances of his original compositions with the New York Choral Society and scoring of several films including El Cochero, El Alcazar de Chapultepec and Una Causa Noble. Guti√©rrez composed and performed the soundtrack for the documentary film Lost and Found in Mexico. In 2013 Gutierrez was featured in the National Geographic Traveler documentary The Granny Diaries. He was a special guest soloist with Arturo Sandoval in the Mexico City Palace of Fine Arts. He continues to tour and perform in Canada, Latin America and the United States.

The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated‚Äîfrom the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 214; see further Bruce W.

Background and education Baldwin was born in 1879 in Lewiston, Maine, the eldest of five children of a Congregationist minister. She moved with her family at the age of nine to East Orange, New Jersey, where she was educated in private school before entering Bates College in 1896. After one year, she transferred to Cornell University where she was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1900. Career as a historian Baldwin remained at Cornell to receive her master's degree in history in 1902, and then went to Europe on a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and research in Sweden. (The subject of her master's thesis had been \\"Gustavus III of Sweden: A Study in Enlightened Despotism.\\") Career as an educator Returning from Europe in late 1903, Baldwin took a series of teaching positions culminating in a position as Instructor of History, and later head of the Department of History, at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at the Baldwin School, she pursued graduate studies in history at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as studies in education at the Teachers College of Columbia University. In 1921, Baldwin left the Baldwin School to attend the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate degree. In 1923, Baldwin took the job as Acting Dean of Women at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (later to become part of Duke University). Seeing little opportunity for a woman in the 1920s to become a full professor at the University of Chicago, Baldwin remained at Trinity to become Dean of Women and Assistant Professor of History. While at Trinity, Baldwin completed her doctoral thesis (on the topic of New England clergy and the American Revolution) in time to receive her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1926. Baldwin's responsibilities as dean and as an active teacher (which she believed necessary to remain effective as an administrator) left her no time for research, and she produced no further scholarly historical material after this time. She did, however, maintain active memberships in various women's educational organizations and North Carolina historical organizations. She also encouraged student participation state and national women's organizations as well as the formation of a number of student-led organizations on campus; under her guidance and example, students launched organizations such as a Forum Committee to invite speakers to East Campus, DISTAFF, a monthly magazine edited entirely by women, the Nereidians, a synchronized swimming club, and numerous honorary and leadership societies such as Ivy, Sandals, and the White Duchy, a counterpart to the Order of The Red Friars. Baldwin retired from Duke University in 1947. Writings As an historian, Baldwin is best remembered for her doctoral dissertation The New England Clergy and the American Revolution. Her other writings include:  * Legacy Baldwin has been held up as an example of the key issues in the intellectual life of women in the early twentieth century. Upon her retirement, she ordered that her papers and notes be sealed for twenty years. Upon their unveiling, it was revealed that Baldwin had struggled bitterly with her role as a female educator and on the education of women in general. She had found little documentation of interest in her research in the lives of women in colonial times, and left unfinished many papers and treatises in which she expressed the disdain she uncovered for the education of women in America. Baldwin remains a much-beloved figure at Duke University and is credited with advancing the prestige of the Woman's College at Duke and the education of young women. One of the most prominent buildings on Duke's East Campus, the auditorium anchoring the campus, is named in her honor in recognition of her dedication to the institution. Recognizing Baldwin's contributions to the University, Duke has created the Alice Mary Baldwin Collection within their library, wherein all of Baldwin's papers are available for review and research.

Clockwise from top left: Pre- amp (white box), moderating cylinders (white cylinders), MCA (gray box), He-3 proportional counter and stand (metal cylinder), data acquisition computer (yellow), and assorted cables (red and grey). The nested neutron spectrometer (NNS) is a tool used for neutron spectroscopy. The NNS is used to measure the energy spectrum of neutrons in a neutron field. This type of detector is used in both research facilities (for characterization of neutron fields) and workplaces, where neutron radiation maybe encountered, for radiation protection purposes. Due to the difficulty associated with the detection of neutrons, the NNS is one of the few pieces of equipment capable of accurately determining the characteristics of a neutron field.  Principles of operation The NNS operates under the same principle as a Bonner sphere neutron spectrometer. The sensitive part of the spectrometer is the Helium-3 proportional counter, which detects neutrons through the reaction 3He(n,p)3H. This particular reaction has a significant cross-section only at thermal neutron energies. In order for a higher energy neutrons to be detected their energies must be decreased, or \\"moderated\\". To slow down neutrons at higher energies the NNS uses different amounts of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The He-3 proportional counter is surrounded by varying amounts of HDPE to sample various energy regions of the neutron field. The standard NNS has seven HDPE cylinders which are nested together, similar to Russian nesting dolls, to measure neutrons of higher and higher energies.

It was instituted by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, as a \\"permanent revenue source\\"Cassius Dio 55.24.9; Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 174. Dio, however, seems to have mistakenly thought that regular army pay (the stipendium) also came from this fund. for pensions (praemia) for veterans of the Imperial Roman army. The treasury derived its funding from new taxes, an inheritance tax and a sales tax, and regularized the ad hoc provisions for veterans that under the Republic often had involved socially disruptive confiscation of property. The praefecti aerarii militaris (singular praefectus) were the three prefects who oversaw the treasury. Benefits The Imperial biographer and historian Suetonius saw the aerarium militare as a response to the uncertainty of retired military men in need who might be inclined to support a coup or foment unrest.Suetonius, Augustus 49.2; Cassius Dio 54.25.6; Phang, Roman Military Service, p. 163. The professionalizing of the army during the Republic created the new problem of veterans, since earlier in Rome's history male citizens served short-term to confront specific threats or carry out seasonal campaigns, and then returned to their normal occupations. The solution in the late Republic had been to settle veterans in colonies in conquered territory, or on ostensibly public land in Italy that in fact had been used by the aristocracy for personal gain; the redistribution of this land by military commanders such as Marius and Pompeius was resented by the elite as a popularist currying of favor among the lower ranks of society. A state-supported benefit helped redirect the former soldier's loyalty from his immediate commanding officer to the Roman state as a whole.H.H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome from 133 BC to AD 68 (Routledge, 2007, 5th ed.), pp. 221‚Äì222. Under Augustus, monetary grants replaced land redistributions, and were better received by the upper classes, who nevertheless complained about new taxes.Phang, Roman Military Service, p. 164; Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 173. Augustus included the aerarium militare among the accomplishments in his Res Gestae, the commemorative autobiography published posthumously throughout the Empire.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 173. In addressing the Senate on the subject, Augustus had stated his intention to provide for military personnel from enlistment through retirement. A soldier earned a one-time praemium or discharge benefitMillar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East, p. 98. upon completing his service (sixteen years for the Praetorian Guard, twenty for regular duty in the army). At the end of Augustus's reign, the pension for a Praetorian guard was 20,000 sesterces (HS), and that of a legionary 12,000.Phang, Roman Military Service, p. 163. In the 1st century, a legionary's retirement benefit would have amounted to about 12 years of service pay. The praemium remained stable until the time of Caracalla, who increased it to 20,000 HS for a legionary and a higher but unrecorded amount for a Praetorian guard.Phang, Roman Military Service, p. 164. When the treasury experienced a shortfall, the emperor might avoid paying pensions by arbitrarily extending the length of military service, in a form of forced retention or \\"stop-loss policy\\". Funding The aerarium militare was part of an Augustan fiscal initiative that was at first greeted with hostility.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 174. In 6 AD, Augustus capitalized the pension fund with 170 million sesterces of his own money,Res Gestae 17.2; Phang, Roman Military Service, p. 163. along with voluntary contributions from client kings and cities.J.S. Richardson, Augustan Rome 44 BC to AD 14: The Restoration of the Republic and the Establishment of the Empire (Edinburgh University Press, 2012), p. 172. The amount was insufficient, and after soliciting proposals on revenue enhancement from senators, all of which he rejected, he finally forced through an inheritance tax of 5 percent (vicesima hereditatium).Swan, The Augustan Succession, pp. 174, 176. Inheritances left to members of the deceased's immediate family were exempted, as were estates below a certain valuation.Swan, The Augustan Succession, pp. 177‚Äì178. The other source of tax revenue for the military treasury‚Äîa sales tax of 1 percent on goods sold at auction (centesima rerum venalium)‚Äîis less attested.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 178. Administration The military treasury was located on the Capitoline Hill at the time of Nero, as attested by a military diploma dating to 65 AD.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 175; Millar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East, pp. 99‚Äì100. It is unclear whether it was a physical storehouse for coins brought to the capital in payment of taxes, or an office for paper transactions.Millar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East, p. 100. The treasury was administered by three prefects (praefecti aerarii militaris), who were former praetors at first chosen by lot for a term of three years.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 175. Later they were appointed by the emperor. Their precise duties are unclear, though they were not charged with collecting the taxes. They may have served mainly to provide financial management and security. Each senatorial prefect was assigned two lictors and other staff, but the later imperially-appointed prefects had no lictors.Swan, The Augustan Succession, p. 176. (The lictor was an honorary bodyguard who was part of the civil service of Rome.) The change to appointment by the emperor may have been made as early as the reign of Claudius. The younger Pliny was a prefect of the military treasury appointed by Domitian.

The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22. Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289. =Los Angeles Dodgers= 2014 Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes. Guerrero with the Dodgers During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats. 2015 In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense. In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of √ìliver P√©rez of the Arizona Diamondbacks. After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games. On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers. His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average. 2016 Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8. =Chunichi Dragons= On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2.http://www.sponichi.co.jp/baseball/news/2017/12/02/kiji/20171202s00001173110000c.html =Yomiuri Giants= On December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal. On December 2, 2019, he became a free agent.

A more comprehensive definition is that it is the ability to respond, absorb, and adapt to, as well as recover in a disruptive event.https://www.resilienceshift.org/work-with-us/faqs/ A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to resist to an extreme event with minimal damages and functionality disruptions during the event; after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even better than the pre-event level. The concept of resilience originated from engineering and then gradually applied to other fields. It is related to that of vulnerability. Both terms are specific to the event perturbation, meaning that a system/infrastructure/community may be more vulnerable or less resilient to one event than another one. However, they are not the same. One obvious difference is that vulnerability focuses on the evaluation of system susceptibility in the pre-event phase; resilience emphasizes the dynamic features in the pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases. Resilience is a multi-facet property, covering four dimensions: technical, organization, social and economic. Therefore, using one metric may not be representative to describe and quantify resilience. In engineering, resilience is characterized by four Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Current research studies have developed various ways to quantify resilience from multiple aspects, such as functionality- and socioeconomic- related aspects.  Equations  The first influential quantitative resilience metric based on the functionality recovery curve was proposed by Bruneau et al., where resilience is quantified as the resilience loss as follows. R_L=\\\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} [100\\\\%-Q(t)]dt where Q(t) is the functionality at time t; t_0 is the time when the event strikes; t_f is the time when the functionality full recovers. The resilience loss is a metric of only positive value. It has the advantage of being easily generalized to different structures, infrastructures, and communities. This definition assumes that the functionality is 100% pre-event and will eventually be recovered to a full functionality of 100%. This may not be true in practice. A system may be partially functional when a hurricane strikes and may not be fully recovered due to uneconomic cost-benefit ratio. Resilience index is a normalized metric between 0 and 1, computed from the functionality recovery curve. R=\\\\frac{\\\\int_{t_0}^{t_h} Q(t)dt }{t_h-t_0} where Q(t) is the functionality at time t; t_0 is the time when the event strikes; t_h is the time horizon of interest.  History  Thomas Tredgold was the introduced the concept of resilience in 1818 in England. The term was used to describe a property in the strength of timber, as beams were bent and deformed to support heavy load. Tredgold found the timber durable and did not burn readily, despite being planted in bad soil conditions and exposed climates. Resilience was then refined by Mallett in 1856 in relation to the capacity of specific materials to withstand specific disturbances. These definitions can be used in engineering resilience due to the application of a single material that has a stable equilibrium regime rather than the complex adaptive stability of larger systems.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.11.002 In his paper Resilience and Stability of Ecological systems (1973), C.S. Holling first explored the topic of resilience through its application to the field of ecology. Ecological resilience was defined as a \\"measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between state variables.\\" Holling found that such a framework can be applied to other forms of resilience. The application to ecosystems was later used to draw into other manners of human, cultural and social applications. The random events described by Holling are not only climatic, but instability to neutral systems can occur through the impact of fires, the changes in forest community or the process of fishing. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. Multiple state systems rather than objects should b studied as the world is a heterogeneous space with various biological, physical and chemical characteristics.

The complex has been renamed the Cotton Factory and is repurposed for small manufacturing and office space for creative professionals. The five buildings on the site were built in 1900 and stand today in their original structures. It is one of the few historic complexes built in the late 19th to early 20th century that remain today in Hamilton, Ontario.  History  The growth of Hamilton's economic landscape during the late 19th and early 20th century is accredited to textile production, the city's second largest industry, second only to the steel mills. The men responsible for this city's economic expansion are the \\"5 Johns\\" of Hamilton (John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, John Sutherland, John Dickenson and John Patterson). The men opened the Catract Power Company in 1896 which brought cheap electricity to the city. They were Hamilton's major landowners in the region, both of which brought manufactures and entrepreneurs from all over North America. The general manager of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck industry in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the \\"5 Johns\\" to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860‚Äì1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger- Cats. Cotton duck manufactured by the Imperial Cotton Company Limited from 1924 The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers. 971.321 HAM The Cotton Factory has always been a \\"people first\\" kind of place. The Imperial Cotton Company produced a quarterly newsletter called, \\"The Fabricator\\", to bring news to the staff about group insurance plans, a cafeteria unit that seated 165 people, upgrades of new technology such as electric refrigerators and a newly purchased lunchroom piano by the Entertainment Committee. News among the staff members are also featured in the Fabricator, highlighting marriages, births, and deaths and recounted vacation stories by the mill employees. In 1924, the Imperial Cotton merged with Cosmos Cotton Mills (formerly Yarmouth Duck & Cotton). The new company, Cosmos- Imperial Mills Limited, owned and operated the complex until 1972, when most of its machinery and workers were sent back to Nova Scotia. A textile museum in Yarmouth houses many of the \\"Big Looms\\" that may have been used at 270 Sherman.  Architecture  The mill building, which housed 1,220 spinning spindles, 3,735 spindles, 98 duck looms and looms for the manufacture of cotton drayer felts, is constructed out of brick and timber with \\"slow burning\\" wood beams positioned across the 30,000 square feet of space on the second and third floor Mill. Next to the Mill Building is a smokestack that was used by three original boiler systems. Adjacent to the smokestack is a storage warehouse that was originally used for sorting, painting, finishing, shipping and waterproofing cotton. Centre of the mill courtyard is the Mills Arts Building, which was a later addition to the 270 Sherman complex and used today for artists to work their private units. Occupants of the building include professional artists that do photography, oil painting, sculpturing and designing to name a few. The Cotton Factory is also a popular location for film and television productions. Its exteriors have been used for scenes from the mid-1800s to modern day and even future apocalypses.

During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals.

Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish. Graduate school and career Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah. There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948.\\"Jeff B. Snyder Succumbs Thursday At Vicksburg Hospital: Body of Prominent Figure Lay In State at Tallulah Courthouse Thursday\\", Madison Journal, October 19, 1951, p. 1 Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978). Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested. After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952. Like Snyder, Sevier was active in the Democratic State Central Committee. He was the national committeeman during the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis.Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, June 2, 1974 Afterward he was selected as the state Democratic Party chairman under Governor Earl Kemp Long. He belonged to the Presbyterian church with his wife. He was affiliated with the 6th Judicial District Bar Association, Rotary International, and the Masonic lodge. Sevier died in 1974 in Mercy Hospital in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Along with many Sevier family members, Sevier and his wife are interred at Silver Cross Cemetery in Tallulah.

Early life The son of Stephen Lewis, vicar of Weobly and rector of Holgate, Shropshire, he was born at Kington, Herefordshire, on 14 March 1689. He was educated at Hereford Free School, under a Mr. Traherne. He was admitted a Bible clerk at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he matriculated 3 July 1704, and graduated B.A. in 1711. He does not appear to have proceeded M.A., but was ordained priest in 1713 at Worcester. High Church propagandist Page from The Scourge, attacking nonconformists of the 1640s In 1717 Lewis established The Scourge, in vindication of the Church of England, a periodical sheet that appeared every Monday. It abused dissenters, latitudinarians, and Catholics. On 15 July 1717 Lewis denounced Benjamin Hoadly from the text, \\"Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defie the Armes of the Living God?\\" Six weeks later he launched an attack on Scottish presbyterianism with the words \\"Every beast loveth his like\\". The paper was presented by the grand jury of Westminster as the work of a libeller and an embroiler of the nation, and Lewis, who absconded, was ordered to stand his trial for sedition at the court of king's bench. In the meantime there appeared The Scourge Scourged, or a short Account of the Life of the Author of the Scourge, vilifying Lewis and his \\"weekly excrement\\". From his hiding-place Lewis issued The Danger of the Church Establishment of England.The Danger of the Church Establishment of England from the Insolence of the Protestant Dissenters, wherein it appears from their late writing that they have attempted to subvert the Liturgy, the Canons, Articles and the whole Discipline of the Church of England, to Ruin the Reputation of the Universities and the Episcopal Clergy, and to inflame the minds of the People against the Established Form of Church Government in this Kingdom. In a Letter to Sir John Smith [his accuser in the matter of the ‚ÄúScourge.‚Äù] \\"Heu pietas, heu prisca fides\\", London, 1718. This epistle, which included a further attack upon Hoadly, passed through two editions, and was answered by A brief Answer to a long Libel. Lewis had the last word in the controversy with his Anatomy of the Heretical Synod of Dissenters at Salter's Hall, 1719. Later life About 1720 Lewis appears to have been acting as curate at St Clement Danes. In 1735 he been keeping a private boarding-school for several years, in Hampstead. Leaving there in 1737 he settled at Chelsea, and sent an account of his life to Thomas Rawlinson on 12 September 1737. Works Lewis also wrote: * An Historical Essay upon the Consecration of Churches, 1719. * The Nature of Hell-Fire, the Reality of Hell-Fire, and the Eternity of Hell Torments explain'd and Vindicated, 1720.

Background  After the Treaty of Paucarpata had been repudiated, the Chilean government again dispatched its fleet, composed of 5 battleships (Aquiles and Arequipe√±o, the corvettes Libertad and Valpara√≠so and the Monteagudo) under the command of Robert Simpson, to disrupt Peruvian commerce. On January 12, 1838 they met a Confederate squadron near the Peruvian port of Islay, on what is known as the Naval Battle of Islay. The Confederate squadron was conformed by the Socabaya, Jun√≠n and Fundador under the command of commander Juan Jos√© Panizo. Simpson attacked but Panizo managed to head him off for several hours until able to escape under the cover of darkness. Both sides claimed victory, but the result was mostly a stalemate that did not affect the course of the war.Valdiz√°n Gamio Jos√© \\"Historia naval del Per√∫\\" pp. 215 Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz had distributed his ships, the corvette Socabaya and the brig Founder in Islay, commanded by the frigate Captain Juan Jos√© Panizo and the brig Jun√≠n in Arica commanded by Commander Miguel Sald√≠var. On January 3, 1838, the commander Miguel Saldivar learned that Chile had disapproved the treaty and that his squadron was heading to Peru, so he sailed to Islay to concentrate the Confederate naval forces, anchoring in that port on January 8.  Battle  On January 12, 1838, the Chilean squadron surprised the confederate in Islay, which largely surpassed in tonnage and fire hydrants fled to the north being persecuted by Simpson. The persecution lasted all night, turning the Confederate ships to shoot the corvette Libertad, which due to its greater speed had overtaken the rest of its squad, to continue the flight, meanwhile the slowest of the Confederate ships brig Jun√≠n had lagged behind, which would continue to force the other two Confederate ships to engage in unfavorable combat or abandon it and continue north. Before this situation Panizo used a clever stratagem, turning round with the \\"Socabaya\\" and the \\"Founder\\" broke fire on the Chilean ships delaying them and allowing the \\"Junin\\" to gain distance, to then turn again towards the north. Three times he performed the same maneuver until the \\"Jun√≠n\\" was out of danger, before the darkness of the night Simpson ordered to stop the pursuit and continued to Callao, where he arrived on January 17.Basadre, Jorge \\"Historia de la Rep√∫blica del Per√∫\\". Volume II pp. 324-325  Aftermath  The controversy over the outcome of this combat is very similar to that which occurred during the Battle of Chipana during the War of the Pacific. While the Peruvian historiographyJorge Basadre. Historia de la Rep√∫blica del Per√∫ (1822-1933): La √©poca fundacional de la Rep√∫blica (1822-1842) pp. 1812 maintains that it was a Confederate victory - because Commander Panizo managed to prevent his ships from being captured or sunk by a materially superior enemy, even saving the slowest of his ships and successfully responding to enemy fire. in its retreat, Chilean historiography considers this combat as a minor action of the war - where the Confederate fleet only limited to successfully fleeing thanks to Panizo's expertise - in which Simpson did not continue the fight because the Confederate ships were owners from the windward, that is, from the favorable side of the wind.

Volkswagen Bratislava Plant History Prototype BAZ MNA Prototype BAZ Locusta 3-door coup√© Funded by the ruling Communist Party to expand car production across Czechoslovakia, it agreed a partnership in 1969 with Italian automaker Alfa Romeo, but the proposed new-model was never developed beyond the clay-mock-up. On 1 July 1971, Bratislavsk√© Automobilov√© Z√°vody (BAZ) was founded, sub-contracted to produce ≈†koda Auto models, but with all pressings and parts supplied by the Czech-based partner. The factory began producing the Mlad√° Boleslav-designed 731 (saloon) and 732 (station wagon), as well as other BAZ marketed small (MNA) and medium-sized trucks (SNA). Later vehicles developed included the 3-door Locusta coup√©. After developing a partnership with Tatra, the company also produced military vehicles, including the popular Praga V3S. BAZ vehicle production ended in 1982, when the production of the ≈†koda Garde was started, with the resultant development of the factory spurring the construction of new apartment blocks in the borough of Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves. However, parts supply from the parent plant in the Czech Republic was slow, resulting often in a number of part-finished vehicles being held in storage, often awaiting singular parts. The factory later produced the ≈†koda Rapid 130/135/136, as well as a variety of parts for other car manufacturers in Czechoslovakia. Some prototypes from BAZ can be seen in Museum of Transport in Bratislava.http://www.muzeumdopravy.com/galeria.html =Volkswagen Group= After the fall of the Iron Curtain, in May 1991 Volkswagen Group bought an 80% share of BAZ. Skoda Auto production continued, and was expanded to include other models within the VW Group portfolio, initially the Volkswagen Passat. In 1998 Volkswagen Group bought out the remaining company shares, and renamed the company Volkswagen Slovakia. Volkswagen then bought the remaining shares in Skoda Auto in 2000. Since VW developed their large SUV platform, the factory has become a specialist producer of all VW Group marques large SUV's, which presently include the Audi Q7 and the Volkswagen Touareg, and the co- designed Porsche Cayenne which is based on the same platform. It is also the only VW Group factory to produce the Golf Syncro four-wheel drive. Since December 2011 the factory has produced the VW up!, as well as the badge- engineered SEAT Mii and ≈†koda Citigo for European markets. Operations The factory area of the plant currently covers an area of . Bodies are assembled and welded in one of two body shops, and then painted with one of 26 standard colours in the paint shop. The co-located Aggregate/Modules hall produces gearboxes for both on-site consumption and various models of the VW Group brands. The bodies are moved to the assembly hall, which covers an area equivalent to 21 football pitches, where the painted body is mated with the pre-assembled under-body and chassis. The VW Group and Porsche models then split. The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Touareg and Up! variants are completed by installing the finishing components including wiring, wheels, seats and the steering wheel. The final assembled SUV is then transported via cable car to the co-located test track for a final on-road test. If the car then passes a further inspection, it is prepared for dealer delivery. Since 2016, the Bentley Bentayga has also been produced at Bratislava.Bentley Bentayga =Logistics= DHL handle all shipping and distribution arrangements from the site, via railway (70%) or road.

Established in 1922, it is the oldest Slovak Gymnasium east of the M√°tra-Slanec Area and is one of two main providers of secondary school education in Michalovce, along with Gymn√°zium na ulici ƒΩudov√≠ta ≈†t√∫ra. History =Background= Before the Czechoslovak declaration of independence on 28 October 1918, the area of surrounding the city of Michalovce was a part of the former Hungarian County of Kosice (). At that time, there was only three secondary schools in the entire county, all of which was purely Hungarian, located in the then cultural centers of Kosice, Presov and Uzhgorod. After becoming independent, patriotic sentiment ran high and Slovaks sensed immediately the need to establish a Slovak high school in the area, in order to provide higher education in Slovak language for the populace in eastern Slovakia. At first the choice stood between three sites in the Zemplin region, which were the cities of Humenne, Trebisov and Michalovce. Due to its ability to provide sufficient funds and staffing, Michalovce soon became the obvious choice for the construction of the new school. = Inter- war period = The new school was finished in 1922 and in the period 1922 - 1938 the school bore the name \\"Czechoslovak state gymnasium.\\" At the stage, the education was conducted in a way that emphasized the idea of the single Czechoslovak nation, and the language taught was the ƒçeskoslovenƒçina, or Czechoslovak language.The School's administrators constantly struggled with finding teachers with sufficient qualifications, teaching post was often filled with engineers, and often the school was dependent on the assistance of local school teachers. In 1931, the school marked its first graduating class, of the 22 students, 18 managed to graduate. Seven years later the school was markedly affected by the First Vienna Award, which saw the departure of all Czech professors along with their families from Michalovce. These were highly skilled academics which undoubtedly contributed to the high reputation of the school. = World War II = Following the Munich treaty in November 1938, the Name of the school was changed to \\"Slovak real high school\\" (). In connection with the events of Munich, the beginning of the 1938-39 school year the school was occupied by the army (mobilization). Teaching was suspended from 24 September 1938 to 10 October 1938. After the First Vienna Award the new students came from schools from the Hungarian territories, (mainly Uzhhorod). 300px After Slovak students started moving to nearby Sobrance and the number of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak‚ÄìHungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became an important part of the school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army. Education The school education programme consists of 8 semesters (4 years), divided into two parts of two years each. Each part includes subjects such as General education, Foreign languages (usually Russian, French, German and English), Physical Education, Informatics and Science/technology.

He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area.The History of Okanagan Mission A Centennial Project, Primrose Upton, 1958, Okanagan Mission Centennial Committee  Background  Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan.The Kelowna Story An Okanagan history, Sharron J. Simpson, 2011, Harbour Publishing Company Limited, His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton.Penticton Years To Remember, A. David MacDonald, 1983, British Columbia Heritage Trust Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan. After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights. In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two- thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay. Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the Penticton. The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892. In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development.

It also refers to the triangular area of Venice where the Grand Canal meets the Giudecca Canal, and its collection of buildings: Santa Maria della Salute, (hence the area is also known as Punta della Salute), the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice, and Dogana da Mar at the triangle's tip.  Geography and history  View of Punta della Dogana by Francesco Guardi, c. 1765 Punta della Dogana is located between the Grand and Giudecca Canals at the tip of an island in the Dorsoduro district. Adjacent to each other are the Dogana da Mar, Patriarchal Seminary, and Santa Maria della Salute. It is diagonal from the Piazza San Marco. The point was used for docking and customs as early as the beginning of the 15th century. The temporary structures built to store merchandise and customs workers were replaced by the Punta della Dogana, whose construction began in 1677.  Dogana da Mar  Sculpture atop the Dogana building The museum's art is housed in and around the Dogana da Mar building. It was built between 1678 and 1682 as a customs house. by Giuseppe Benoni. The arcade styles reflect their construction in different eras. Atop the building are two statues of Atlas holding a golden globe upon which 's Fortune stands. The 17th-century statue turns in the wind. The group was built by Bernardo FalconiBernardo Falconi- Dizionario-Biografico www.treccani.it, accessed 15 November 2019 to represent the supremacy of the Republic of Venice. The last renovation of the building was done by Alvise Pigazzi in 1838. = Restoration = The building was restored by Tadao Ando from January 2008 to March 2009, funded by Fran√ßois Pinault, a French billionaire and art collector. He signed a 33-year agreement with the city. The building had been empty for decades prior, with failed plans to turn it into apartments or a hotel. Dogana da Mar's stuccoed brick exterior was restored without additions, and is the only part of the original structure left intact. Cosmetic imperfections and the stucco were repaired, and bad areas were reinforced with stainless steel anchors, but areas with visible brick were left exposed. The interiors were left bare without surface treatment, and bricks were replaced sparingly. The room partitions from the last two centuries were replaced with parallel, rectangular halls. The roof was replaced by a similar roof with timber gables, with added skylights. The new floors are made of exposed and polished concrete, in some places covered with linoleum. Frank Peter J√§ger called these smooth surfaces Ando's trademark, along with glass and steel fixtures that clash with the raw irregularities of the unfinished walls. He added that, for Ando, this combination \\"symbolizes the union of past, present, and future\\", the building, his architecture, and the art within it, respectively. Ando wanted to make the western entrance's face out of concrete slabs, but the change was opposed by the city. Exibart's Jacqueline Ceresoli described the building as having \\"industrial and minimalist soul\\" with red brick walls. The renovation cost was .

Exibart's Jacqueline Ceresoli had similar praise for the show. Fran√ßois Pinault commissioned a statue for the tip of Punta della Dogana from Charles Ray upon receiving approval from the city to start the museum. Ray made an eight-foot-tall boy holding a frog by its leg intended as a public sculpture called Boy with Frog. The sculpture's permit was set to be negotiated four times annually. Boy with Frog was originally encased upon the museum's July 2009 opening after protests following its installation. The city moved in early 2013 to replace the statue with a reproduction of the streetlamp once situated there. Its spokesperson said that the sculpture's installation was designed to be temporary. Ray refused an offer to relocate the sculpture to Palazzo Grassi, opting to put the sculpture into storage. Independent curator Francesco Bonami wrote in La Stampa that the removal was \\"administrative cowardice\\" and the lamppost represented \\"cultural darkness\\".

It was re- designated a port of entry in 1984 and became a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in 1987. Transloading operations include the handling of a variety of bulk cargo, notably of construction aggregate, break bulk cargo, and containers for clothing, fishing apparel, agricultural produce, and other consumer goods, and has at times involved lighterage. It is operated under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation. Salem waterfront The paddle steamer Major Reybold at what was once called Majors Wharf, plied the Delaware between Salem and Philadelphia in the 19th century on the Salem Line. The Delaware River estuary was the territory of the Lenape. European settlement of the region around today's Salem began in 1638 when the colony of New Sweden was established and the Salem River was called Varkens Kill or Hogg Creek. Tradition holds that ethnic Finns settled inland from Finns Point in 1638. In 1641, a group from the New Haven Colony settled around Varkens Kill. In 1655, it was re-claimed by New Netherland and in 1664 it became part of the Province of New Jersey. In 1675, a land patent was given to John Fenwick, who founded the town. Originally, Salem's wharves were located along Fenwick Creek and Salem Creek, and received calls from Philadelphia, Boston and the Caribbean. During the American Revolutionary War, it was occupied by the British to prevent supplies from reaching American troops. Steamer service between Salem and Philadelphia began in 1825. The Salem Railroad opened in 1863. The Salem River Cut-off, which bypasses a large bend in the river at the port, was authorized in 1925. For much of the 20th century, the waterfront along the Salem River Cut-off and Fenwick Creek was dominated by industries centered around glass manufacturing, food processing, and mineral/oil storage. From 1905 to 1978, H. J. Heinz Company operated a large processing plant along Fenwick Creek. Mannington Mills, Anchor Glass, and AluChem are located proximate to the port, as well as the South Jersey Farmers Exchange in nearby Woodstown. Port of entry and foreign trade zone Salem was originally designated a port of entry in 1682 by royal commission of the British Crown. The City of Salem established a municipal port authority in 1982. In 1984, the port resumed international shipping operations and the United States Customs Service granted it status as a water port of entry, the first such designation made since the 1930s. It is now a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which is headquartered in Newark and covers New Jersey. Along with Millville Municipal Airport, portions of the port have been part of foreign trade zone #142 since 1987. Subzones associated with FTZ142 are located at the Port of Paulsboro and other locations in South Jersey. Shipping channels and lighthouses The Salem above the head of navigation The Delaware and Salem rivers are tidal. The Delaware River Main Channel has been maintained at a depth of . Dredging to a depth of was completed in 2017. Reach C, which includes the entrance to the Salem Port, was completed in 2010. The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a shallow draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The Salem River and Cut-Off were first channelized in 1925 to a depth of . The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another to the Cut-Off and to the head of navigation at the first bridge crossing (Route 49). The Delaware River is served by various range lights. Reedy Island is approximately southwest of the mouth of the Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River Directional Light (), and 11 other lighted navigational aids. Rail and road The city and county of Salem have a long history of glass manufacturing, along with the site of the first successful glass production facility in North America. Adjacent to the port is the oldest manufacturing facility for glass containers in the United States, established in 1863 and long known as Anchor Glass, once owned by Anchor Hocking and now part of the Ardagh Group. The Delaware Memorial Bridge and the Interstate Highway System are upstream from the port The rail line serving the port is called the Glass House Running Track and is an extension of the Salem Branch. On the verge of abandonment by Conrail, the southern section of the route from Swedesboro to Salem was purchased by the county in 1983 and is leased to Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ). Long neglected, it is in poor condition and travel speeds are very slow. The line is undergoing upgrades to the rail bed, trackage, a trestle at Oldman's Creek, and other work. At Swedesboro, SRNJ interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations to reach Pavonia Yard, the regional rail center. Route 45 and Route 49 provide access to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and the nearby Delaware Memorial Bridge. In 2005, the Route 49 bascule bridge built in 1927 over the Salem River was replaced with a fixed bridge that can be converted to a vertical lift bridge and has been dedicated the Veteran‚Äôs of Salem County Memorial Bridge. Commercial shipping Container ship at Salem The Salem Municipal Port Authority was established in 1982 with the intention to revitalize and coordinate shipping in the port district. In 2005, the Salem City Industrial District Brownfield Development Area was created to spur re-use of brownfields, including numerous properties within and adjacent to the port district, which is located along the southern banks of the river between the Salem River Cut-Off and the Route 49 bridge just outside the downtown area. It encompasses several terminal and wharf facilities for barges and container ships for bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. In 2006, the municipal port authority described the typical container ship making use of the port as carrying 150 containers and taking approximately 12 hours to unload and reload. The Bermuda Islander, a Dutch-flagged container ship, calls regularly at Salem. =Salem Terminal= The South Jersey Port Corporation operates three terminals at the Port of Camden and is expanding operations to the Port of Paulsboro. The agency owns and operates the Salem Terminal, which had been publicly operated as the Salem Municipal Wharf and privately operated by Salem Terminals Ltd. and Del Stevedoring. It includes berth-side truck access to of berthing space with of beam (breadth). There is of covered shed and warehouse storage space. The terminal handles barges and container ships for construction aggregate, clothing, fishing apparel, motor vehicles, agricultural produce, seafood, and consumer goods.Port of Salem Terminal , South Jersey Port Corporation. Retrieved 2012-07-2013. =Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring= Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring relocated from Maine to Salem in the 1980s to be closer to the source of products they export and utilize the newly established port facilities. In 1990, they opened the Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring Wharf, a small wharf terminal that is also utilized by several other shipping companies and located approximately above the entrance of the Salem River at 128 Tilbury Road on the east side of Barber's Basin marina, to handle bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. It has of berthing space with water depth. It includes of open storage space and utility connections for refrigerated containers. While the wharf is currently owned by Bermuda International Terminals, it is operated by Mid-Atlantic. Mid-Atlantic also operates the Tilbury Road Associates owned wharf with of berthing space, utility connections for refrigerated containers, and of open storage space on the west side of Barber's Basin. =Port Inland Distribution Network= The Port Inland Distribution Network involves new or expanded transportation systems for redistribution by barge and rail for the shipped goods and containers that are delivered at area ports in an effort to curtail the use of trucks and their burden on the environment, traffic, and highway systems. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), and Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), are involved in initiatives to review and develop this network. While it was determined that Salem was not an ideal location within the program for handling container shipping for intermodal freight transport, a private sector service provider began in 2010 the short sea shipping of aggregate products with a barge service between Salem and Tremley Point, Linden on the Arthur Kill in the Port of New York and New Jersey. It addresses a critical missing link in multimodal freight transport between ports in the Delaware Valley and the Northern New Jersey's urban Gateway Region. America's Marine Highway is a similar US Department of Transportation initiative to capitalize on US waterways for the transport of goods for which NJDOT applied and received approval for review and potential development of their initiative into a federally supported project. Salem would be considered for increased transportation by shipping vessels to customers along the East Coast. Ferry and boating Barber's Basin is a marina between the two wharfs operated by Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring. It is home to the United States Coast Guard Small Salem Station, a seasonal unit in operation from late May to mid-October. In 2013, the Coast Guard reduced staffing from daily to weekend operations. The private docks of the Salem Boating Club, across the river in Pennsville, also serve pleasure craft. Delaware River and Bay Authority's Three Forts Ferry Crossing was renamed the Delaware City‚ÄìSalem Ferry in 2013 to reflect changes in service due to Hurricane Sandy damages. The seasonal service, rather than traveling to Fort Mott, departs from Barber's Basin with service across the river to Delaware City, which has the nearby Fort DuPont State Park, with connecting service to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island effective May 4, 2013 for the summer seasonal service. The ferry returned to serving Fort Mott on its previous route (instead of Salem) in 2015 and is now called the Forts Ferry Crossing. Salem has been an occasional port of call for promotional and educational functions for the A. J. Meerwald, the New Jersey State Tall Ship.

It is the first Droid to be a high end smartphone exclusively developed by Motorola for Verizon Wireless. It is part of the Verizon Droid line, and was announced on 23 July 2013 along with the Droid Ultra and Droid Mini at a joint Motorola and Verizon Wireless press conference. The Droid Maxx maintains a similar design shape to its predecessor, the Droid Razr HD, including the Dupont Kevlar unibody form. It included Motorola's proprietary X8 Mobile Computing System, which consists of 8 cores: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, 1 low-power core for natural language processing, and 1 low-power core for contextual awareness processing to enable the new Touchless control feature. The internal battery was increased in size to 3,500 mAh. The on-screen buttons for back, home, and multitask functions were moved to off-screen capacitive soft-keys below the screen. The Droid Maxx also includes Motorola's Active Notification feature. Reception towards the device was mostly positive, with the caveat that the device is only available on the US carrier, Verizon Wireless. Some reviewing outlets called the device \\"the best Android device available on Verizon Wireless\\". Many others praised Motorola's Active Notification system, which turns on part of the AMOLED screen to \\"blink\\" notifications to the user, in lieu of a traditional LED notification light. The soft touch kevlar unibody as well as the overall physical design was praised as well. Reviewers were mixed to the device's continued use of a 720p HD resolution at a 5 in (130 mm) screen size, though complimented the AMOLED display's brightness, deep blacks, and its benefits to battery conservation. Features =Operating system and software= The Droid Maxx runs a mostly stock version of Google's Android mobile operating system, initially shipping with the version 4.2.2 \\"Jellybean\\". Jellybean 4.2 included various improvements to accessibility, new lock screen features with quick access to the camera, support for wireless display (Miracast), and a new built-in clock application with world clock, stopwatch, and timer. Motorola and Verizon released an update to Android 4.4 \\"KitKat\\" on 19 December 2013, and an additional update to Android 4.4.4 on 15 July 2014.. KitKat brought restyled navigation bars, \\"immersive\\" full-screen mode, stronger security, power management and some other minor improvements. Motorola also enhanced its proprietary camera software for better color, exposure, and dynamic range accuracy and included the updated Google Hangouts application which included SMS/MMS messaging functionality. Finally, support for the Square credit card reader was added. The KitKat 4.4.4 update brought further improvements to camera functionality, improved Bluetooth connectivity, and added Isis Mobile Wallet (now called Softcard). The smartphone can share its internet connection over WiFi (hotspot), and can access the Google Play Store, an online distribution platform for the Android OS managed by Google. Users may purchase and download applications developed using the Android SDK, music, movies, television shows, books, and magazine subscriptions. The Droid Maxx, like its Moto X sibling, showcases the Google Now function via Touchless Control. By speaking the hot phrase: \\"Ok Google Now\\" (even while the phone is asleep), the device will launch a voice assistant which taps into Google Now to control the phone and run natural language queries with the Google search engine without requiring physical input from the user. This function makes use of the natural language processor in the X8 system. Active Notifications displays relevant notifications to the user while the phone is face-up. The minimalist notifications show on the lock screen as white icons against a black background; power is conserved by not turning on pixels that would display the black background. Furthermore, by use of the Contextual Awareness processor in the X8 system and proximity sensor, the Droid Maxx \\"knows\\" when it is face-down or in a pocket, and will not display Active Notifications. =Design= The Droid Maxx user interface consists of three soft keys: back, home, and multitask, lock/power button, and volume rocker keys. The construction is a unibody design (no removable panels) and consists of a thin black bezel devoid of any branding surrounding the screen and a DuPont Kevlar sealed back plate in either matte clear or glossy red tint finish. The shape maintains the tapered corner look of the Droid [RAZR] design language. Size has been increased to house a 5 in (130 mm) Super AMOLED touchscreen, with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels at 294 ppi and made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The device is 8.5 mm (0.33 in) thick and weighs 167 grams (5.9 oz). =Hardware= Droid Maxx is powered by the proprietary Motorola X8 system-on- chip. It includes a total of 8 cores with various functions: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor clocked at 1.7 GHz, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, and 2 low-power cores: for natural language processing and for contextual awareness processing. The X8 system is designed to conserve power by utilizing low-power cores for the language and contextual processing. The device's battery is 3500 mAh, which provides a claimed 48 hours of \\"typical\\" usage. The phone comes with either 16 or 32 gigabytes of on board storage as well as NFC capability and Qi wireless charging.

By 31 December 2017 Pogo had produced 3.6 million ounces of gold at a grade of 13.6 g/t. Annual production for 2019 was 159,344 ounces. At 31 December 2019 the mine had Proven and Probable Reserves of 1.5 million ounces of gold at a grade of 7.5 g/t (JORC). It is located northeast of Delta Junction and east of Fairbanks.  Orebody and mining method  The orebody consists of numerous highly irregular quartz veins, ranging in thickness from with being typical, and ranging in dip from horizontal to vertical with 30-45 degrees being normal. A complex system of faulting offsets the veins both parallel and perpendicular to the strike, resulting in a \\"chopped-up\\" orebody. Until 2019 the mine utilized drift-and-fill and overhand cut-and-fill mining methods when, under new owner Northern Star Resources, the mining method was changed to longhole stoping. Access to the orebody is via decline and spiral ramp. After blasting, ore is trucked to the central underground \\"ore bin\\", where it is then fed to a conveyor that takes it out of the mine directly to the mill. Typical daily production is about 2,500 tons of ore yielding approximately 1,000 troy ounces of gold. Pogo is notable for its paste backfill system, where 20% of the mine's tailings from which gold has been extracted are mixed with cement and then pumped back underground to support subsequent further excavation. This has the additional environmental benefit of reducing the amount of tailings that need to be stored on surface, minimizing the footprint of the mine's dry- stack tailings storage facility.

Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the Jubilee and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the City of Vernon. He used the City of Vernon until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named Penticton, was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the Penticton to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars. Later years Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS Aberdeen, Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the Aberdeen was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich.

Central processing unit  CPU-NUS VR4300 central processing unit The Nintendo 64's central processing unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300, a licensed variant of the 64-bit MIPS Technologies R4300i, itself a cost-reduced derivative of the MIPS R4200. Built by NEC on a 350 nm process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16 KB for instructions, 8 KB for data). Although a floating-point unit exists as a logical coprocessor, it shares the main datapath, meaning that floating-point instructions will stall the integer pipeline. The 120-pin 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above. It dissipates close to 1.8 watts (figure given for a stock 100 MHz VR4300 part). With a clock rate of 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 is generally considered to be the most powerful console CPU of the fifth generation of video game consoles. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retains the computational abilities of the 64-bit MIPS R4200, though few titles take advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game titles generally use faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these are sufficient to generate 3D scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space, which came at a premium with contemporary technology. The CPU is constrained by a 562.5 MB/s bus to the system RAM, and in order to access the RAM, the CPU must go through the Reality Coprocessor (RCP), and can not use DMA to do so as the RCP can. This issue is further compounded by the RDRAM's high access latency. Programs emulating the Nintendo 64 benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host. Most of these emulators perform the majority of calculations at 32-bit precision and trap the few subroutines that actually make use of 64-bit instructions.  Reality Coprocessor  RCP-NUS \\"Reality Coprocessor\\" Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI coprocessor, named the Reality Coprocessor, or RCP. The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and the Reality Signal Processor (RSP). Each area communicates with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s of bandwidth. The RSP is a MIPS R4000-based 128-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing the chip's functions to be significantly altered by each software title if necessary, to allow for different types of work, precision, and workloads. A number of microcodes were provided by Nintendo,https://level42.ca/projects/ultra64/Documentation/man/pro- man/pro25/index25.1.htmlhttp://n64devkit.square7.ch/qa/graphics/ucode.htm while a few companies, such as Rare and Factor 5, would later develop their own microcodes. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, and triangle setup. The Reality Display Processor is primarily the Nintendo 64's pixel rasterizer, and also handles the console's Z-buffer compute. The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen (who later founded ArtX in 1997). The RCP was manufactured by NEC, using its 350 nm 3LM CMOS process, which NEC had introduced in 1994. The processor contains 2.6million transistors manufactured using this process. The 160-pin processor has a die size of 81, giving it a transistor density of over 32,000 per . Thermal dissipation is rated at 2.8 watts. Instead of a discrete sound processor, the RSP frequently performs audio functions, although the CPU can be tasked with this as well. It can play back most types of audio (dependent on software codecs) including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is theoretically capable of a maximum of 100 channels of PCM at a time, but only in a case where all system resources are devoted to audio. It has a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. In practice, however, storage limitations caused by the ROM cartridge format limit the audio size and thus quality. Some game titles are designed for higher quality audio when storage expansions are available, as with F-Zero X Expansion Kit. The RDP performs rasterization, generating, from geometry, pixels to be filled before output to the display. The system RAM is connected to the RCP via a 562.5 MB/s bus. The CPU accesses RAM through the RCP's memory map using the system address/data bus. The RCP has DMA controllers in many of its interfaces, and its internal bus arbiter handles priorities between them. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above.  Memory  Rambus RDRAM18-NUS, early 2-chip variant The final major component in the system is the random-access memory, or RAM. Following its design heritage in SGI supercomputing, the Nintendo 64 implemented a unified memory architecture (UMA), instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, as seen on its competitors. The RAM itself consists of 4.5 megabytes of Rambus RDRAM, fabricated by NEC, of which only 4 MB are visible to the CPU; the rest is used exclusively by the RCP for tasks such as anti- aliasing and Z-buffering.Nintendo 64 Architecture - a Practical Analysis, Rodrigo Copetti. System RAM is expandable to a total of 9 MB with the Expansion Pak. The RAM has a 9-bit data bus at 250 MHz; as RDRAM transfers data at both the rising and falling edge of the signal (a technique also known as DDR), it provides the system with 562.5 MB/s peak bandwidth, shared between CPU and RCP. Rambus technology was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth at a relatively low cost. The narrow bus makes board design easier and cheaper than the higher width data buses required for high bandwidth out of slower-clocked RAM types (such as VRAM or EDO DRAM); this way, the N64 mainboard could be designed with only 2 layers. However, RDRAM, at the time, came with a very high access latency. The combination of high bandwidth and high latency meant that significant effort was required from developers to achieve optimal results. Early N64 revisions use two 18 Mbit RAM chips; in ca. 1998 these were replaced with a single 36 Mbit chip, same as was used on the Expansion Pak. The Nintendo 64 Game Pak ROM cartridges were much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers of many games, such as Nintendo EAD's Super Mario 64 or Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine.  Video  The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. This is accomplished through the proprietary \\"MULTI OUT\\" connector on the rear of the system, which was carried over from the SNES and later reused on the GameCube. Although the digital-to-analog converter chip used in early models had the capability to produce RGB video, it was not connected by default for this purpose, and later revisions lacked the pin connections for this purpose entirely. The system came bundled with a composite cable (labeled Stereo A/V cable by Nintendo). Available separately (and included with the system in the UK) were a RF modulator and switch set (for connection to older televisions) and an official S-Video cable, although the latter was only sold at retail stores in Japan. In the U.S., the official S-Video cable could only be ordered direct from Nintendo of America, while in PAL territories, no S-Video cable was officially sold altogether. Furthermore, Nintendo omitted several components from the S-Video signal path in PAL consoles, meaning that using an unmodified NTSC S-Video cable will result in an overbright, garish image, or no image at all. The system supports standard-definition resolutions up to 480i (576i for PAL units). Few games make use of this mode, and most of those which do also require use of the Expansion Pak RAM upgrade. Most games instead use the system's low-definition 240p (288p for PAL models) modes. A number of games also support widescreen display ratios using either anamorphic widescreen or letterboxing. Games with support for this include Banjo-Tooie, Donkey Kong 64, GoldenEye 007, 007: The World Is Not Enough, Jet Force Gemini, Perfect Dark, Starshot: Space Circus Fever, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, Mission Impossible, Hybrid Heaven, and South Park.

As with Nintendo's previous consoles, the Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal base console costwith lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game. Integrating a CD-ROM drive, with its expensive and slow moving parts, would have drastically increased the console's base price by 50% and reduced its performance. As with the Famicom Disk System floppy drive of the 1980s, Nintendo's strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a higher-capacity and cheaper medium to complement the Game Pak. This strategy resulted in the 64DD, a floppy drive which was launched two years late in 1999 and only in Japan, leaving it as a commercial failure and the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium. In the console's first year from late 1996 through 1997, Game Pak sizes were with a typical third party retail price of , then reached in 1998, and finally from 1999 onward. Some developers such as Factor 5, Rare, and Nintendo, were fanatically supportive of the high-speed solid-state medium because it is the most effective solution to the universal video game development problem of having preciously limited system RAM. A few developers had vastly heavier designs, especially the cinematic full motion video of Square's Final Fantasy VII (1997)but sufficient data compression techniques had not yet been invented and ROM chips were not yet capacious and affordableso they reluctantly had to target CD-ROM based platforms instead. Many developers preferred the cheaper and more rapid prototyping software development time of cartridge, and others the quicker and cheaper final delivery of the retail CD-ROM disc product. Some development teams eventually achieved ingenious software tactics to avail of the slowly increasing Game Pak ROM sizes, such as the more than 90 minutes of real-time rendered cinematic scenes in the 32-megabyte The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) or the two CDs worth of pre-rendered full motion video converted to the 64-megabyte Resident Evil 2 (1999), considered the best version of the game and one of the most ambitious console ports of all time. The Nintendo 64 is the last major home console to have cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges. History =Development= To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high- capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the canceled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64. That sentiment was soon revised in the same year when Nintendo's vice president of marketing Peter Main stated that \\"The choice we made is not cartridge versus CD, it's silicon over optical. When it comes to speed, no other format approaches the silicon-based cartridge.\\" The Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995, which destroyed a major RAM factory in Japan, increased the prices of RAM in the 1990s. Nintendo planned to continue to supplement the use of system RAM through innovations in high speed ROM cartridges. SGI suggested that Nintendo should utilize cartridges to keep the console's costs low and performance high. At Shoshinkai of 1995, Nintendo announced its development of the complementary 64DD, a rewritable magnetic disk based peripheral with several times faster transfer rates and seek time than competing CD-ROM consoles. In 1997, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, \\"CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres. ... I think we'll make the game on a cartridge first, then ... finish it up as a full-out 64DD game.\\" Many Nintendo 64 games were developed in a way that depended upon or were expanded by that device. However, after the device's launch had been delayed several years until 1999 and restricted to Japan, it was discontinued early as a commercial failure. In 1996, prior to the Nintendo 64's launch, President of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi praised the user experience of the cartridge format: Until the launch of the Switch in 2017, the Nintendo 64 was the latest major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, and most handheld systems except the PlayStation Portable use cartridges. Most home systems since the fifth generation use disc, flash, and online formats. The succeeding GameCube uses an optical disc format, in a boon to some developers.\\"Fight!.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 14.12 (2001): 212. Business Source Complete. Web. July 23, 2013. The company stated its goal was to reduce manufacturing costs and did not cite storage space as a rationale. Because the new console lacks backwards compatibility with Nintendo 64 Game Paks, Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo 64. Features =Save files= Some Game Paks include internal EEPROM, flash memory, or battery-backed-up RAM for saved game storage. Otherwise, game saves are put onto a separate memory card, marketed by Nintendo as a Controller Pak. =Copy protection= Each Nintendo 64 Game Pak contains a lockout chip (conceptually similar to the 10NES) to prevent manufacturers from creating unauthorized copies of games and discourage production of unlicensed games. Unlike previous versions, the Nintendo 64 lockout chip contains a seed value which is used to calculate a checksum of the game's boot code. To discourage playing of copied games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak, Nintendo produced five different versions of the chip. During the boot process, and occasionally while the game is running, the console computes the checksum of the boot code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak, failing to boot if the check fails. On June 2, 1997, a U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order against Games City for its Game Doctor and Doctor V64 products, which allow users to copy from a Game Pak to a CD or hard disk drive. Games City was ordered to stop importing, distributing, advertising, or selling any such devices. Analysis The Nintendo 64 Game Pak medium provides essential benefits alongside a number of drawbacks, in a deliberate tradeoff. While it provides the fastest possible load times and greatest durability, its solid-state silicon is more expensive to produce and has less storage space than the competing CD-ROM format. In 1997, journalist Alex S. Kasten observed that the issue \\"goes beyond the economics of the media [because] market strategy and style of game play also factor into the cartridge/CD decision [so] Nintendo has remained cartridge- based for two main reasons: economics and performance.\\" =Console cost= Nintendo knew that a CD-ROM drive would greatly increase the cost of the console in a price-sensitive market. Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick said, \\"We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off.\\" =Performance= Specified at 5 to 50 MiB/s, Nintendo cited the ROM cartridges' very fast load times in comparison to disc-based games. Few contemporary CD-ROM drives have speeds above 4√ó, and the competing consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation have 2√ó drives running at about with high latency. This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers in many games, such as Nintendo EAD's Super Mario 64 or Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Howard Lincoln said, \\"[Genyo Takeda, the Nintendo engineer working with Silicon Graphics to design Project Reality] and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do the kind of things that we wanted to do with Super Mario.\\" Sega countered by claiming that load times on CD-ROMs could eventually be minimized. \\"We are finding more and more ways to mask the load factor,\\" Ted Hoff, vice president of sales and marketing at Sega, said. \\"We are working out ways to overlay or leapfrog the loading time.\\" =Durability= Game Paks are far more durable than compact discs, the latter of which must be carefully used and stored in protective cases. It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors. While Game Paks are more resistant than CDs to physical damage, they are sometimes less resistant to long-term environmental damage, particularly oxidation (although this can be simply cleaned off) or wear of their electrical contacts causing a blank or frozen screen, or static electricity. =Manufacturing cost= Due to complex manufacturing processes, cartridge-based games are more expensive and difficult to manufacture than their optical counterparts. PlayStation CD-ROMs reportedly cost $1 to manufacture, while cartridges for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System cost $15 and Nintendo 64 cartridges reportedly cost more than $30. Publishers had to pass these higher expenses to the consumer and as a result, Nintendo 64 games tended to sell for higher prices than PlayStation games. The maximum price of most PlayStation games was US$50, and Nintendo 64 cartridges could reach , such as the first pressing of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Games in Sony's line of PlayStation Greatest Hits budget line retailed for US$19.95, while Nintendo's equivalent Player's Choice line retailed for US$29.95. In the United Kingdom, Nintendo 64 games were priced ¬£54.95 at their time of release, while PlayStation games were priced at ¬£44.95. In the United States, the typical price of a third- party game was around in the system's first year on the market, though this dropped incrementally after Nintendo reduced wholesale prices on the cartridges. In August 1997, Kelly Flock, president of Sony Interactive Studios America (SISA) said \\"Most N64 carts are costing consumers $55 to $70, compared with $20 to $50 for a PlayStation CD.\\" =Manufacturing time= Game Paks took longer to manufacture than CDs, with each production run (from order to delivery) taking two weeks or more. By contrast, extra copies of a CD based game could be ordered with a lead time of a few days. This meant that publishers of Nintendo 64 games had less flexibility to forecast demand. Publishers had to attempt to predict demand for a game ahead of its release. They risked being left with a surplus of expensive Game Paks for a failed game or a weeks-long shortage of product if they underestimated a game's popularity. Sony used this shortcoming to appeal to publishers. Andrew House, vice president of marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment America, said \\"They can manufacture the appropriate amount of software without taking a tremendous inventory risk associated with the cartridge business.\\" Sony's Kelly Flock added, \\"And the CD allows smaller manufacturing runs with very short lead times. ... The CD allows the publisher to take creative content risksnot inventory risk.\\" =Storage space= During the Nintendo 64's development in 1995, Nintendo reported that the deliverable maximum cartridge size was 96 megabits (12 megabytes), with a theoretical maximum of 256 megabits (32 megabytes). As fifth generation games became more complex, they pushed Game Paks to the limits of their storage capacity. In practice, the few largest vintage Game Paks can hold up to 512 megabits (64 megabytes) of data, whereas CDs can hold more than 650 MiB. Storage sizes range from 4 MB (32 Mbit) such as Automobili Lamborghini and Dr. Mario 64, to 64 MB (512 Mbit) such as Resident Evil 2 and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Games ported from other platforms may utilize more aggressive data compression (as with Resident Evil 2) or altered content (as with Spider-Man and Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero) so that they may be released on the Nintendo 64. Exceptionally large games on CD-based systems can be made to span across multiple discs, while most Nintendo 64 games are contained within one Game Pak, as the use of an additional Game Pak or of one maximally sized Game Pak was often considered prohibitively expensive, and the 64DD expansion drive was released late and discontinued early. Due to the Game Pak's space limitations, full motion video is not usually feasible for use in cutscenes. A notable exception is Resident Evil 2#Releases and ports, which contains the equivalent material of the two CD-ROM discs of the original PlayStation version, plus some expanded content, plus higher quality audio samples and unique surround sound technology, making it what IGN called \\"the best version of the game\\" and what Eurogamer called \\"one of the most ambitious [and impressive] console ports of all time\\". Some games contain significant cinematic scenes with graphics generated by the system in real-time, as with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Nintendo downplayed the importance of studio-prerendered videos, with software engineering manager Jim Merrick saying, \\"Full-motion video demos really well on a CD-ROM, but once you get into the software, as a gamer, you're thinking 'let's get on with the game.'\\" Nintendo also countered that developers did not generally use the full 650MiB capacity of CD-ROMs, stating that the smaller storage space encouraged developers to focus on gameplay rather than flashy visuals. Many CD-ROM games are known to simply consist of cartridge sized games alongside a prerendered audio track, or just a copy of a game already released on cartridge. The relatively few games that have ever been released based on full motion video typically have very high production costs and timeframes. =Copy protection= CD-ROMs are known for relative ease of illicit copying on personal computers, whereas Game Paks are physically proprietary and more difficult to copy. Reception =Critical reception= John Ricciardi, writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, called Nintendo's decision to stick with a cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 \\"stubborn\\". The author called it a major contributor to the company's competitive disadvantages, even more so than the failed partnership with Sony to create a CD format and console.Ricciardi, John. \\"Still Super After All These Years.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 14.9 (2001): 126. Business Source Complete. Web. July 23, 2013. Brian Dipert, writing for EDN Magazine, said that the Nintendo 64 Game Paks are \\"bulky and expensive, eating into Nintendo's profit margins compared with competitors‚Äô inexpensive CD and DVD plastic discs\\". On a more positive side of the topic, Aaron Curtiss of The Los Angeles Times praised Nintendo's choice of the cartridge medium with its \\"nonexistent\\" load times and \\"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\\", concluding that \\"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega [Saturn] and Sony [PlayStation] seem downright sluggish\\". Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, Curtiss cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \\"place a premium on substance over flash\\", and noted that the launch games lack the \\"poorly acted live-action sequences or half- baked musical overtures\\" which he believed were usually found on CD-ROM games at the time. =Industrial reception= As part of the controversial technological tradeoffs between storage and performance, which has been endemic to the entire computing industry, and which Nintendo had faced since the Famicom's cassette and floppy disk systems, the selection of a cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 was essential to several developers' ability to deliver top quality games. However, the choice of cartridge format coupled with the commercial failure of the supplemental 64DD were also key factors in Nintendo losing its dominant position in the gaming market. Some of the Game Pak's advantages are actually nullified by its disadvantages. That generation's primary competitors, the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, rely completely upon 2√ó CD-ROM drives for game storage. These discs are much cheaper and faster to manufacture and distribute, resulting in lower manufacturing costs to third-party game publishers. As a result, some game developers who had traditionally supported Nintendo game consoles prior to Nintendo 64 were now developing games for the competition. Some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation. This includes Square which had produced a Final Fantasy technology prototype using the same SGI-based development platform used by Nintendo, and Enix which had initially pre- planned Dragon Warrior VII for the Nintendo 64 and its yet-unreleased 64DD disk drive peripheral at least by 1996, but reluctantly migrated due to the developers' increasingly ambitious use of storage space with their fundamentally cinematic game format. Shiny Entertainment had been planning to develop MDK for the Nintendo 64, but switched to PC when they found the cartridge space was insufficient for their plans for the game and Nintendo failed to produce the promised 64DD in a timely manner. Some developers who remained on Nintendo 64 released fewer games for the system. Konami was the biggest example of this, releasing 29 Nintendo 64 games but more than 50 on the PlayStation. Overall, new game releases were less frequent for the Nintendo 64 than those for the PlayStation. Aside from the difficulties with some third parties, the Nintendo 64 supports some of the most popular, genre- defining, and critically acclaimed games such as Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and GoldenEye 007, having given the system a long market lifespan. Much of this success was credited to Nintendo's strong first- party franchises, such as Mario, which had strong name brand appeal, and by Nintendo's own second-party developers such as Rare. When interviewed by Computer & Video Games at Shoshinkai of 1995, about how the theoretical use of CD instead of cartridge could have impacted its past game development, Rare reportedly said that \\"Blastdozer would require more time and much more RAM\\", and that \\"Goldeneye would require twice the RAM\\". In the 2013 Director's Commentary video about Conker's Bad Fur Day, after observing the imperceptible loading times and the \\"seamless\\" transitions between major scenes of the game, Rare programmers declare that \\"the thing about cartridges is ‚Ä¶ it's solid state ... so it's actually a much more advanced, better medium than discs. You can't have as much [content] on there‚Äîor, rather, you can but it's very expensive‚Äîbut as a medium, cartridge is [vastly] ahead in superiority to any blu-ray or disc ‚Ä¶ [or] hard drives.\\" Upon Factor 5's introduction to the Nintendo 64, the developer had already delivered highly optimized multiplatform games for almost a decade, ranging from 8-bit home computers to 32-bit CD-ROM. After having developed innovative techniques for CD-ROM media in two different LucasArts releases for PlayStation, Factor 5's cofounder Julian Eggebrecht said this: Eggebrecht identified RAM, not storage, as the key bottleneck for any console; so he identified CD-ROM performance of the day as exacerbating that bottleneck and favored cartridges to virtually eliminate the bottleneck. Even after having designed Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for personal computers equipped with hard drives, Eggebrecht significantly attributed the technologically and aesthetically superior nature of Factor 5's Nintendo 64 port, to his programmers' aggressive utilization of the cartridge format.

History View of the nave from the choir Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows. The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with murals depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The murals and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an Ordensburg (albeit on a small scale). The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby. Architecture The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building. The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with murals executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion. A single remaining stained glass window remains, a baptismal font from the 13th century and an oddity: a mite box in stone, which is signed by the stonemason in runes, Lafrans made this stone.

Adobe Days, her memoir of growing up in southern California, is considered a classic of the genre. Family and education Sarah Hathaway Bixby Smith was born at Rancho San Justo near San Juan Bautista, California, in 1871. Her parents were Llewellyn Bixby, a rancher, and Mary Hathaway Bixby. Llewellyn Bixby was a sheepman, and with other members of the Bixby family had come to California in 1852, driving sheep and cattle from the East. Llewellyn, together with his brother Jotham and three cousins (John William Bixby, Thomas Flint, and Benjamin Flint), formed the Flint-Bixby Company in 1855 to buy land to run their livestock. By the mid-1880s they had amassed large landholdings: in addition to Rancho San Justo were Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos in Long Beach, California (both now run as museums), Rancho San Juan Caj√≥n de Santa Ana, and part of Rancho de los Palos Verdes. Sarah spent her childhood on the San Justo, Los Cerritos, and Los Alamitos ranches. She earned her bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in 1894 and became a writer and advocate for women's independence and higher education. Writing Bixby Smith wrote both lyric poetry and nonfiction. Her volumes of poetry include My Sage-brush Garden (1924), Pasear (1926), Wind Upon My Face (1930), and The Bending Tree (1933). Bixby Smith is best known for three highly personal memoirs of California history. The first, \\"A Little Girl of Old California\\" (1920), was a brief memoir of her girlhood, later expanded into the book Adobe Days (1925). Adobe Days uses details of Smith's childhood on the family sheep ranches to tell the intertwined stories of the pioneering Bixby family as it rose to prominence in California and the development of Los Angeles from its frontier-town days to the end of the 19th century. It has been called \\"deservedly a classic of California autobiography ... [capturing] perfectly that intersection of civilization and frontier, New Englandism and Spanish Southwest, which turn- of-the-century California defined as its own special heritage.\\" She also wrote Milestones in Los Angeles: Being a Brief Narrative of Los Angeles Through Five Decades (ca. 1933). At the time of her death, she was working on a book about the history of southern California. Bixby Smith collaborated with second husband Paul Jordan-Smith on a manifesto extolling an elevated and spiritual feminism. Entitled The Soul of Woman: An Interpretation of the Philosophy of Feminism, it was published under his name in 1916. Advocacy Bixby Smith was involved with women's groups and served at various times as president of the Friday Morning Club and vice-president of the American Association of University Women. She was also a trustee of Scripps College and a member of the Claremont School Board and the Historical Society of Southern California board. In the early 1930s, she was a delegate to the Pacific Relations Conference in Shanghai. Art Bixby Smith was an amateur painter of landscapes and portraits in a realist style that hearkens back to the mid- nineteenth century. Her paintings prompted her second husband Paul Jordan- Smith's Disumbrationism hoax. Personal life Bixby Smith was married and divorced twice. In 1896, she married Arthur Maxson Smith. With her inherited wealth, she financed Arthur‚Äôs graduate divinity school studies at the University of Chicago and Harvard on his way to becoming a Unitarian minister. In 1900, they moved to Hawaii for two years when Arthur was appointed the head of Honolulu‚Äôs Oahu College and Punahou School. They returned to the mainland as a result of Arthur's liaisons with Oahu College students and moved to Claremont, California, where Arthur taught philosophy at Pomona College from 1904 to 1909. They commissioned architect Arthur B. Benton to build them a 14-room mansion on 20 acres directly across the street from the campus. In 1909, when Bixby Smith discovered that her husband had been having an affair with the children's au pair, she helped him to get a new position in northern California at the First Unitarian Church in Berkeley. Smith's life became more complicated when she got romantically involved with Paul Jordan-Smith, a married minister at the same church, who was also a graduate student in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley. When their liaison was discovered, the English Department faculty voted not to renew his fellowship. After Bixby Smith's 1916 divorce from Arthur and marriage the same year to Paul, the couple moved with the children to her mansion in Claremont, which had in the meantime been turned into a school for boys by W. E. Garrison. In 1917, the school's lease ended and they began renovating the house back into a private residence, which they named Erewhon on completion. Around this time, they met and subsequently became friends with one of Bixby Smith's cousins, the photographer Edward Weston, who made a photographic portrait of her around 1919. There are also a number of Weston photographs of bathers shot around Erewhon's indoor pool. Later, the couple moved to a mansion on Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Angeles, where their dinner parties were famous for bringing members of the city's bohemian circles together with the ruling oligarchy. Eventually, Paul left Bixby Smith and they got divorced. From her marriage to Arthur Maxson Smith, she had five children: Arthur Jr. (known as Maxson), Bradford, Llewellyn, Roger, and Janet. Her marriage to Paul added his three children from a prior marriage to the household: Isabel, Ralph, and Wilbur Smith. Death and legacy Bixby Smith died of a trichinosis infection in Long Beach, California, on September 13, 1935, at the age of 64. Bixby Smith's correspondence, along with photographs, press clippings, and other documents, are in the Charles E. Young Research Library Department of Special Collections at the University of California, Los Angeles. Rancho Los Cerritos (now run as a museum) houses the Sarah Bixby Smith Manuscript Collection and has four of her oil paintings on display.

History Nepal Government Railway in the 1950s In 1923, a short narrow gauge railway was built by J. V. Collier of the Indian Forest Service to transport Nepalese timber to India. Collier had been assigned by Nepal's Rana prime minister to manage the forest department in Nepal. In the winter of 1924, Martin and Co. of Kolkata conducted a survey to construct a light railway from the border north to Bichako (Amlekhganj). Construction began in March 1926, and the Nepal Government Railway opened on 16 February 1927. The narrow gauge railway used a track gauge of . The railway possessed seven steam locomotives, 12 coaches and 82 wagons. It operated steam-powered Garratt locomotives manufactured by Beyer, Peacock and Company of the United Kingdom. Until the highway was built, the Amlekhganj-Raxaul railway was the only route indirectly connecting the capital Kathmandu with India. From Kathmandu, travellers journeyed over the hills on foot, and then by lorry to Amlekhganj where they took the train to India. The need to walk was eliminated after Tribhuvan Highway linking Kathmandu with Amlekhganj was built in 1956. The first daily bus service began operating on it in 1959, conducted by a private company named Nepal Transport Service. =Closure= The Nepal Government Railway remained in service till 1965 when the construction of the highway linking the southern border made it redundant. The railway was closed down 1965 subsequently. In popular culture The Nepal Government Railway appears in the opening scenes of the first Nepali film Aama (\\"Mother\\") made by the government of Nepal and released in 1964.

This print is simultaneously an example of the uchiwa-e (fan print) and aizuri-e (monochromatic blue print) genres. It is part of the permanent collection of the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. Uchiwa-e Uchiwa (Âõ£Êâá) are non-folding, flat, oval fans. They are still used today for cooling rice in the preparation of sushi, in dance performances, and as a cooling tool. Historically, uchiwa were a predominantly female accessory, men typically carrying folding fans known as ≈çgi (Êâá), suehiro (Êú´Â∫É) or sensu (ÊâáÂ≠ê).Salter 2006, 25 They are associated with summer, traditionally having been sold only during the summer months, and decorated with summer imagery. At least one modern critic argues that, due to their use by women during periods of heat, uchiwa \\"can have suggestive connotations.\\"Salter 2006, 79 Like ≈çgi-e (ÊâáÁµµ) folding fan prints, uchiwa-e were traditionally made from washi rice paper mounted on a wooden frame. Images were printed on paper, then cut along the margins and pasted onto a skeletal bamboo frame.Bell 2004, xivMarks 2010, 14 As a result of their frequent handling, few pristine mounted examples remain.Harris 2010, 106 Aizuri-e Also known as aizome-e (ËóçÊüìÁµµ) and ai-e (ËóçÁµµ), aizuri-e (ËóçÊë∫Áµµ) translates literally as \\"blue printed picture,\\" and describes prints that are produced entirely or predominantly in shades of blue.Later examples included small yellow and vermilion elements. (http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E8%97%8D%E6%91%BA%E7%B5%B5) A counterpart to ostensibly red and pink benizuri-e (Á¥ÖÊë∫Áµµ), aizuri-e were a late Edo period development. Perhaps due to the fact that single colour prints were cheaper to produce,Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System the aizuri technique was particularly popular for uchiwa-e. In the past, some art historians theorized that aizuri-e arose as a result of an 1841 government ban on the use of lavish colour in the then-dominant nishiki-e (Èå¶Áµµ), multi-coloured woodblock prints. The existence of a number of prominent examples predating the ban, however, suggests that aizuri-e did not simply come about as an alternative to poly-chromatic images. While the earliest recorded use is in an 1829 print by Eisen, Utagawa Sadahide, Hokusai,10 of the prints in the original 36 Views of Mount Fuji (1826-1833) were produced as aizuri-e (Harris 2010, 106). Hiroshige,See the uchiwa-e print \\"Full Moon at Tsukuda Island\\" (‰ΩÉÂ≥∂Â§ú„ÅÆÊúà) from the series 69 Stages of the Kisokaido from 1852. Toyokuni IISee \\"Beauty Holding a pipe\\" from the c. 1830 series 5 Modern Beauties. and Kunisada all produced notable examples. The increased popularity of aizuri-e is directly linked to the 1829 importation of the first synthetic colouring agent to Japan. Known in the west as Prussian Blue, Berlin Blue, or bero („Éô„É≠) as it came to be known, effectively challenged natural indigo as an ukiyo-e mainstay due to its lower price and decreased susceptibility to fading from light exposure. Aizuri has been described by one critic as having \\"revolutionized landscape prints.\\" Bokashi Given the lack of colour contrast in the monochromatic aizuri-e, late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This led to the development of bokashi, a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a hake brush.Harris 2010, 31 The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water.Faulkner 1991, 29 While aizuri-e themselves were inexpensive to print, bokashi was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as uchiwa-e.Salter 2006, 139 Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity. Detail of two dancing figures Utagawa Kunisada =Biography= Utagawa Kunisada (Ê≠åÂ∑ùÂõΩË≤û) was born in 1786 in the Honj≈ç district of Edo (present-day Tokyo) into a wealthy family of ferry service owners.Marks 2010, 120 He began an apprenticeship with the head of the prestigious Utagawa school of artists, Toyokuni I, in 1807, and took the artist name Kunisada to include the second character (ÂõΩ - kuni) of his mentor's name.Jesse 2012, 95 In 1844, Kunisada succeeded his master as Toyokuni III (‰∏â‰ª£Ê≠åÂ∑ùË±äÂõΩ).Harris 2010, 70From his accession to the name Toyokuni in 1844, Kunisada consistently signed his works 'Toyokuni II,' indicating his refusal to accept the legitimacy of his immediate predecessor, Toyokuni II. He is, however, always referred to as Toyokuni III (Marks 2010, 120). Kunisada emerged as a book illustrator in 1807 with the series \\"Twelve Hours of the Courtesans\\" (Keisei j≈´nitoki). Kuchi-e book illustrations were essential to the success of the then popular sharebon and kiby≈çshi books, and this soon became a lucrative market for Kunisada due to his talent and ambition. His position within the Utagawa studio afforded him access to training from the finest masters, and connections to publishers, actors, theatres and poet's associations. This, in turn, led to many commissions. By the early 1810s, he had opened his own studio, and demand for his illustrations had outstripped that for his master's. His great success was also reputedly linked to his \\"convivial and balanced demeanor, and [the fact that] he delivered his commissions on time.\\" Kunisada was \\"without a doubt... the most prolific and successful print artist of all time.\\" He was incredibly prodigious, creating between 35 and 40 thousand designs for individual ukiyo-e prints during his lifetime. His studio was larger than that of any other print artist, and he had a large stable of several dozen students.Kunisada's commercial success and business acumen is attested to by the lavishness of his property: \\"A rare picture of an artist house is in a book on the Ansei Edo earthquake of 1855, showing Kunisada's large house with additional storage building, but it cannot be considered as standard for all artists because of Kunisada's unparalleled success\\" (Marks 2010, 25). As a further indication of his unprecedented success, when he died in 1865 after having headed the Utagawa school for around 40 years, he was the subject of four separate shini-e memorial portraits. He is buried on the grounds of Bansh≈çin K≈çunji Temple in present- day Nakano ward, Tokyo, alongside Toyokuni I (1769‚Äì1825) and Kunisada II (1823‚Äì1880). =Names= Like many artists of the Edo period, Kunisada was associated with a number of names throughout his lifetime. Personal names Professional names =Works= Although Kunisada designed many surimono and fan pictures, most of his works are in the ≈çban format.One of several standard print sizes, measuring approximately 15.5 x 10.5 inches / 39 x 26.5 cm. He also produced over sixty paintings. Given his incredible output, it is not surprising that Kunisada was active in various genres, including kabuki-e and yakusha-e (kabuki actor pictures), bijin-ga (pictures of beauties), y≈´rei-zu (ghost pictures), sum≈ç-e (sumo wrestler pictures), shunga (erotica), musha-e (warrior prints), and uchiwa-e. He is also credited with popularizing Genji-e, a print genre related to the 11th century novel The Tale of Genji, through his 1829-1842 book series, Nise Murasaki inaka Genji (A Country Genji by a Fake Murasaki).Marks 2010, 25 In 1808, he began creating yakusha-e, and these were to become the mainstay of his production, making up 60 to 70% of his total works. So prolific was he, that he came to be known as \\"Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (yakusha-e no Kunisada).\\" Two popular genres which are under-represented in Kunisada's oeuvre are nature images (kach≈ç-e/ Ëä±È≥•Áµµ) and landscapes (f≈´kei-e/ È¢®ÊôØÁµµ). He rarely designed pure landscapes, but began in the 1820s or 1830s to incorporate landscape elements into prints featuring beautiful women and actors.Marks (2010, 120) dates landscape use to the 1830s, while Faulkner (1991, 34) argues that he \\"followed the vogue of including landscape in his paintings\\" in the 1820s \\"Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers\\" with its spare background landscape, is an example of this type of piece. =Reputation= Despite his success during his own period, Kunisada was not highly regarded in the west until quite recently.The Lavenberg Collection of Japanese Prints Critics today consider Kunisada to have been \\"a trendsetter... in tune with the tastes of urban society,\\" and credit him with a \\"more humanized\\" style than his contemporaries,Faulkner 1991, 17 and with bringing a sense of realism to ukiyo-e, particularly in his depiction of the female form.Calza 2003, 335 Many argue, however, that the quality of Kunisada's later works degraded into \\"gaudy and ostentatious\\" use of colour,Harris 2010, 73 and \\"lost... elegance in the human figure\\".Faulkner 1991, 36 Ukiyo-e specialist Rupert Faulkner is particularly scathing, asserting that Kunisada's work \\"became noticeably coarser and somewhat clumsy, revealing a cheap and gaudy caricaturism of grotesque facial expressions and exaggerated poses.\\"1991, 36 It has been suggested that his production generally suffered \\"because of over-production and lowering of artistic standards,\\"Munsterberg 1998, 129 as well as possible mental or physical health issues, which led to Kunisada becoming a near-recluse in 1847. As art historian J. Hillier notes, \\"Kunisada's career tells the tragedy of the downfall of ukiyo-e. With evident talent and tremendous verve, his early prints have qualities that link him with the great days of the school, but the great mass of his prints are hastily designed, over-coloured and badly printed.\\"Hillier 1991, 126 Fan Print =Image= The scene depicted on the fan is of two male bugaku dancers in full ceremonial costume, who appear to be performing a dance in lock-step with no audience in evidence. Bugaku, made up of the characters for 'dance' (Ëàû-bu) and 'music' or 'entertainment' (Ê•Ω-gaku), joined Japanese culture from China, Korea, India and Southeast Asia in the late 8th century, as a form of dance performed at the imperial court, as well as at temples and shrines. Dancers assume stylized hand, arm and foot poses accompanied by drumming and the world's oldest surviving orchestral music, gagaku. Bugaku is often performed by dancers wearing masks to represent fictional characters, though not in Kunisada's print. There are four bugaku genres: civil, warrior, children's, and running dances. The figures here appear to be performing the latter. From the late 1820s, Kunisada began studying painting under Hanabusa Ikkei (Ëã±‰∏ÄÁè™), master of the Itch≈ç school. The art-name appearing on this print, \\"K≈çch≈çr≈ç\\" (È¶ôËù∂Ê•º), borrows characters from his teacher's pseudonym (Shink≈ç) and from the name of the school's founder, Hanabusa Itch≈ç (Ëã±‰∏ÄËù∂). Both of these artists painted bugaku scenes prior to \\"Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers,\\" which are very different in style from Kunisada's image. =Signature= The print is signed near the right edge of the fan. It reads vertically from right to left and top to bottom as follows: * Line 1: ≈åju (ÂøúÈúÄ) - a prefix meaning \\"by special request,\\" suggesting it may have been commissioned * Line 2: K≈çch≈çr≈ç (È¶ôËù∂Ê•º) - an art-name (g≈ç) used 1825-1861,ref>These dates are from Marks (2010, 120). Lane asserts Kunisada began using this name in 1833 (1978, 295), while the Japan Arts Council website dates its use to 1827-1851. mainly on non-actor prints. * Line 3: Kunisada ga (ÂõΩË≤ûÁîª) - artist name used 1807-1843, followed by 'picture' (i.e. 'by Kunisada') * End of line 3: double circular toshidama-in (Âπ¥ÁéâÂç∞) seal =Toshidama= The double circle mark below Kunisada's signature is a toshidama-in, the distinctive seal used by all generations of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I first adopted it, for reasons unknown, in 1808 or 1809. It is a lucky symbol, referencing gifts of coins given to children at New Year's. Kunisada gave the mark his own unique twist, elongating it and making it a yellow frame with red infill containing his signature. From 1850, he used this cartouche-style almost exclusively. Title and signature =Date= The ROM dates the print to sometime between the mid-1820s and 1844; however, there are indications that the date can be narrowed to between 1830 and 1843. Synthetic blue pigment was not introduced to Japan until 1829, and it is unlikely that expensive natural indigo would be used on a medium as cheap as uchiwa-e. Kunisada's signature is flanked by two circular toshidama- in seals rather than appearing within an oblong, stylized toshidama cartouche. This suggests the print belongs to his early career. =Provenance= The print was donated to the ROM by Sir Edmund Walker (1848‚Äì1924), who was the long-time president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and served as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ROM.Waterhouse 1975, 12 Walker began collecting Japanese art in the 1870s, making him one of the earliest collectors in North America. He bought many of his pieces in New York between 1873‚Äì1875 and 1881‚Äì1886, and during a trip to London in 1909.Waterhouse 1975, 13 In 1919, after travelling to Japan, China and Korea, he was named Honorary Consul-General of Japan for Toronto.Waterhouse 1975, 15 =Print details= * Size: ≈çban * Format: uchiwa-e * Title: none indicated * Subject: 2 male bugaku dancers performing in a landscape defined by two trees * Signature: ÂøúÈúÄ / È¶ôËù∂Ê•º / ÂõΩË≤ûÁîª (≈çju / K≈çch≈çr≈ç / Kunisada ga) * Seal: double toshidama-in * Publisher: none indicated * Censor seals: none * Date seal: none * Genre: uchiwa-e, aizuri-e * Condition: 4 circular holes on right edge of paper suggesting previous inclusion in a book; some minor creases and stains * Provenance: Sir Edmund Walker Collection See also * Princess Takamado * Spring and autumn landscapes (Hara Zaish≈ç) - items in same gallery * Unit 88-9 (Kiyomizu Masahiro) - item in same gallery * Female Ghost (Kunisada) - print in same collection * Eijud≈ç Hibino at Seventy-one (Toyokuni I) - print in same collection * Ichikawa Omez≈ç as a Pilgrim and Ichikawa Yaoz≈ç as a Samurai (Toyokuni I) - print in same gallery * Bust portrait of Actor Kataoka Ichiz≈ç I (Goch≈çtei Sadamasu II) - print in same gallery * View of Temp≈çzan Park in Naniwa (Goch≈çtei Sadamasu) - print in same gallery References * Bell, David.

Both parts aired on Nickelodeon on September 29, 2012. The Turtles rise to the surface for the first time since being mutated, and witness the Kraang, a race of brain-like aliens with robotic bodies, capturing April O'Neil and her father, Kirby. The Turtles attempt to rescue the O'Neils while learning that the strange green ooze possessed by the Kraang could hold many secrets relating to their mutations. Plot =Part 1= After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface. After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners. Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation. =Part 2= While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies. The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs \\"Snakeweed\\". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him. The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter. Reception Max Nicholson of IGN gave \\"Rise of The Turtles\\" a rating of 8.5/10, saying \\"The action sequences are fluid, fast- paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick.\\" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped.\\" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode \\"a tad on the bland side\\". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, \\"in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new\\". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is \\"so polished and ell executed,\\" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating \\"A very strong start to the series, then, and one I‚Äôve found myself revisiting frequently.\\" The episode's original run garnered approximately 3.9 million viewers within the United States.

The different ways that humans communicate with one another are plentiful, but the wave gesture is one of the clearest examples of how researchers get a better understanding of how they are essential part to language and thought.Gesture. Cartmill, Erica A.; Goldin-Meadow, Susan Matsumoto, David (Ed); Hwang, Hyisung C. (Ed); Frank, Mark G. (Ed), (2016). APA handbook of nonverbal communication. APA handbooks in psychology., (pp. 307-333). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association, xxiv, 626 pp. History The waving of the hand is a nonverbal gesture that has an unclear origin but is said to have dated back to as far as the 18th century however, it was not called waving and was not used as saying \\"hello\\", or \\"goodbye.\\" The original gesture of waving was saluting. Prior to the 18th century, knights removed the guard of their helmets to show their identity, following with a salute to show they come in peace; saluting is also used to show others that they are not armed with weapons and do not pose a threat. The action of saluting was formalised only in the 1780s by European armies, since then, it has become a common way of properly addressing one another in the military setting. There is also an alternate ASL origin In the 1800s, waving handkerchiefs was a way to show approval or excitement or to call attention for the deaf, which is known as the \\"Chautauqua salute.\\" It is recorded during a Canadian event in 1884 that multiple attendees forgot their handkerchief and so waved their hands in the air as a way to clap during the event. In modern days, the accepted and common way for a deaf individual to applaud is raising hands in the air and simultaneously shaking their open hand and moving their fingers back and forth. Deaf Waving \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\" to the deaf requires a different protocol and has an alternate meaning than the standard, one action waving gesture that means both \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye.\\" For an ASL user or a deaf individual, saying \\"goodbye\\" is done by repeatedly opening and closing the right hand, and it faces the receiver of the gesture. This method is used to say \\"goodbye\\" to a group of people; saying \\"goodbye\\" to an individual is done with a different method. Saying \\"hello\\" is done by the traditional waving of the right hand. This method is used to say \\"hello\\" to a group of people, likewise with implying \\"goodbye\\", there is a different method to say \\"hello\\" to an individual. Components The waving of the hand has multiple variables and styles of performing the gesture. The common waving of the hand to mean \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\" is done by moving the hand side to side, but there are more than one form of waving, each form having its own meaning. =Variables= Waving has four variables: the open palm (is the palm curved or straight), the angle of the wave (big waves or short waves), the elevation of the hand (above the head or held low), and the movement pattern of the wave (sideways rotation, up and down motion, side to side motion). =Variations= There are different ways to wave the hand; some include the standard side-to- side wave, palm wide wave, wiggly wave (finger wiggle wave), \\"flirtatious\\" wave, open-and close finger wave, arm wave, and the \\"Miss America\\" wave. People wave by raising their hand and moving it from side to side. Another common wave is to raise one's hand and repeatedly move the fingers downward toward the palm. A variant known as the wiggly wave consists of holding the hand near shoulder level and wiggling the fingers randomly. This can be used to appear cute or flirtatious to the target of the wave. The gesture can be used to attract attention at a distance. Most commonly, though, the gesture means quite simply \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye . The royal wave, also known as a regal wave, pageant wave, parade wave, or Miss America wave, is a similar but distinct kind of hand waving gesture in which a person executes something alternatively described as either a 'plastic grin' with 'fingers cupped' and 'forearm swaying side-to-side' or a \\"vertical hand with a slight twist from the wrist\\". The gesture is often performed, to various degrees, by different members of the British royal family, signaling anything from regality, class and control to elegance, restraint and character. Cultural interpretations In American culture, waving is a known gesture that means \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\". That gesture can also be used to call the attention of someone, for example waving down a taxi, or waving at a friend from a great distance. That gesture can may be interpreted differently and have a different meaning or even be highly offensive in South Korea, Europe, Nigeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Latin American countries, India, Japan, and other places. =African culture= Nigeria In Nigeria, waving the hand with the palm facing outward in front of someone's face is highly offensive and should be avoided. =Asia= China In China, women greet other women by waving. Japan In Japan, hand waving while the palm is kept outward and near the face is a gesture used to display confusion or that the individual waving does not know or understand. South Korea In South Korea, it is inappropriate to call the attention of someone with a palm-up arm wave. Instead, the proper way to wave to someone or call for attention is to wave vertically, making sure the palm of the hand is in a downward position. It is not uncommon to see waving among the younger population (in South Korea) to display their departure rather than bowing, which is the traditional way of greeting one another. Waving the hand outward towards the face is also used to grab the attention of a pet or child. =European culture= In Europe, there are two different common forms of waving: the palm-show and the palm-hide. The palm-show is dominant across most of Europe, but Italy predominantly uses the palm-hide wave. Waving the hand to say \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\" is done by moving the fingers down towards the wrist and back to an open palm position while keeping the palm facing out. Another way to say \\"goodbye\\" is done by wagging the fingers. That motion (wagging fingers) is also used to say \\"no.\\" Greece In Greece, waving the hand with the palm facing out is an insult, rather than a greeting. Holding the hand out, palm facing out and all five fingers exposed is offensive and dates back to the Byzantine times, when moutza would involve prisoners' faces being tainted with charcoal by their own hands and being forced to parade down town streets, moutza. In American culture, holding the hand out like that can be used to call someone's attention or to greet someone. Ireland In Ireland, the deaf use the hand wave to greet one another. Deaf women use an \\"open palms up half moon shape\\" type of wave to greet one another. Men, however, use a different way of greeting one another or women. =Latin America= In Latin American countries, people greet one another by kissing, hugging or shaking hands. Waving their hand is uncommon, but it neither has any negative representation nor causes offense. Nicaragua In Nicaragua, waving to someone is tolerated but does not display proper etiquette. Instead, it is common to hug, kiss, or shake hands, following with the proper time of day (\\"good morning,\\" \\"good afternoon,\\" or \\"good evening\\").

History The company was founded by Jessica Richman, Zachary Apte, and Will Ludington who were scientists in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences. In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign. The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC. As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis. One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Zhang, Sarah. ‚ÄúMicrobiome Startup uBiome Will Sequence Poop for the CDC.‚Äù Wired. Nov. 30, 2015 Quote: \\"Recent controversy over the blood testing company Theranos has highlighted the sometimes loose regulations, and the Food and Drug Administration has it wants to regulate lab tests more strictly\\" Products and services Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome‚Äôs data set. In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California. In 2016, uBiome received accreditation from the College of American Pathologists.  Technology  , the company first amplifies a portion of the bacterial gene that encodes 16S ribosomal RNA using PCR, then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in order to categorize the bacteria at the genus level. The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons. A 2014 report in Xconomy said the company outsources the sequencing. The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer. In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices. uBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andMe, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley.  Controversies  Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval. The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues. The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013. In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication. In April 2019, FBI agents raided the UBiome office in an investigation over possible insurance fraud. Cofounders Apte and Richman were put on administrative leave pending an investigation by the company's board.The company filed for bankruptcy on September 4, 2019 amidst the investigation.

It grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree up to tall. Its fragrant flowers feature a white tinged pink corolla. The berries are purple when ripe. Its habitat is dry forest and coastal thickets. Acokanthera oblongifolia is used in local African medicinal treatments for snakebites, itches and internal worms. The plant has been used as arrow poison.

Life The son of John Rigby, by his wife Sarah (d. 1773), daughter of John Taylor, he was born at Chowbent, Lancashire, on 27 December 1747. One of his sisters married Dr. Caleb Hillier Parry, and became the mother of Sir William Edward Parry. Educated at Norwich School and Warrington Academy, Rigby was apprenticed in 1762 to David Martineau, surgeon, of Norwich, and then studied in London. Admitted a member of the Corporation of Surgeons on 4 May 1769, he married in the same year, and settled in Norwich. In 1786 Rigby took the lead in establishing the Norfolk Benevolent Society for the relief of the widows and orphans of medical men. In July 1789 he visited France and other parts of the continent, witnessing the storming of the Bastille. A practical agriculturist, he was the friend of Thomas William Coke of Holkham, he experimented on his own farm at Framingham Earl, about five miles from Norwich. In 1783 Rigby became a member of the corporation of guardians of Norwich, and promoted the economical administration of the Poor Laws. Meeting with much opposition, he resigned in the following year. He became alderman in 1802 in a very tight contest for the North Ward, sheriff in 1803, and mayor of Norwich in 1805, presiding over a meeting addressing the issue of smallpox in the city.Peter Eade, Some Account of the Parish of St. Giles, Norwich (1886), pp. 323‚Äì4; archive.org. Rigby is said to have made known the flying shuttle to Norwich manufacturers, and to have introduced vaccination. In politics Rigby was a Whig, and a supporter of William Windham. In 1794, however, when Windham became Secretary at War and had to stand again for Norwich, Rigby was one of the disillusioned Whigs who backed James Mingay against him, and proposed the candidate. Windham was elected, but Mingay's reputation as a Whig was boosted.historyofparliamentonline.org, Mingay, James (1752-1812), of New Place, Thetford, Norf. and Ashfield Lodge, nr. Bury, Suff. Rigby died on 27 October 1821, and was buried at Framingham. Works In 1776 Rigby published An Essay on the Uterine H√¶morrhage which precedes the Delivery of the full-grown F≈ìtus (3rd edit. 1784; 6th edit., with a memoir by John Cross, Norwich, 1822). This work was translated into French, by Marie-Anne- Victoire Gallain Boivin (1818), and German, and made Rigby's professional reputation. He wrote also: * An Essay on the Theory and Production of Animal Heat, and on its Application in the Treatment of Cutaneous Eruptions, Inflammations, and some other Diseases, London, 1785. *Chemical Observations on Sugar, London, 1788. *An Essay on the use of the Red Peruvian Bark in the Cure of Intermittents, London, 1783. *Reports of the Special Provision Committee, appointed by the Court of Guardians, in ‚Ä¶ Norwich, 1788. *Further Facts relating to the Care of the Poor and the Management of the Workhouse in the City of Norwich, a sequel. * Holkham, its Agriculture, etc., Pamphleteer, 1813, vol. xiii.; 2nd edit. with ‚Ä¶ additions, Norwich, 1817; 3rd edit. ‚Ä¶ enlarged, Norwich, 1818.

BroadR-Reach technology allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cable. Benefits for automotive manufacturers integrating the BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard include reduced connectivity costs and cabling weight, according to Broadcom Corporation, now Broadcom Limited, inventor of the BroadR-Reach standard.  Networks  Using BroadR- Reach technology in automotive enables the migration from multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view parking assistance, rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive- qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective.  Physical Layer  The BroadR- Reach automotive Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit and receive (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable. In order to better de- correlate the signals, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements.  Standardization  The OPEN Alliance SIG is a special interest group formed by BMW, Broadcom, Freescale, Harman, Hyundai, NXP and STMicroelectronics to establish BroadR-Reach as an open standard and to encourage wide scale adoption of automotive Ethernet as the connectivity standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception in late 2011, membership has reached more than 140 members as of May 31, 2013. IEEE 802.3 has standardized 100BASE-T1 in IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96.  Licensing  The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard was officially released in December 2011, following the formation of The OPEN (One-Pair Ether-Net) Alliance Special Interest Group (SIG) (OPEN Alliance SIG). License to the specification for BroadR-Reach is available to all interested OPEN Alliance SIG members under RAND terms via a license from Broadcom Corporation.

It is a mature residential subdivision with about 400 houses located just inside the Ottawa greenbelt near the Rideau River, and about 11 km from downtown Ottawa. It is bordered by the Black Rapids Creek and the greenbelt to the south, Prince of Wales Drive to the east, Merivale Road to the west, and the Pineglen community to the north. Amberwood Crescent meanders through the community, exiting onto Prince of Wales and Merivale. Tennyson Drive links Country Place to Pineglen. Houses in Country Place were built mostly in the early 1970s and are similar in size and design. The only exceptions are houses on Campfield Ct. which was built in the 1980s on land that had originally been set aside for a possible school. The community has an active community association that runs events several times a year, maintains an outdoor rink in the winter, and helps promote the interests of the residents. Country Place is within the Knoxdale- Merivale Ward of the City of Ottawa. Transportation Overall, transit access to the community is limited due to its low densities. The community is served by OC Transpo route 187 which supplies morning and evening rush hour connections to Baseline Station. Route 80 runs down Merivale Road at the edge of the community, connecting the community to Barrhaven and central Ottawa. Route 199 also runs on Merivale Road and serves people arriving from the east in the morning, and heading to the RCMP headquarters in Barrhaven. Limited service is also available on a branch of Route 96 on the northern edge of the community and links the community to areas east of the Rideau River. The community is a short drive to the Fallowfield railway station served by Via Rail. This can be reached also on foot or by bicycle using the Greenbelt Pathway.  Facilities and attractions  *Country Place Park ‚Äì Has play structures, a soccer field, a basketball court and an ice rink in the winter. *Finger Parks - Several small, mostly forested off leash dog park areas separate sections of the community. There are pathways through these parks, connecting to various courts, to Pineglen and to the Greenbelt Pathway. *Greenbelt Pathway - This gravel pathway used for walking, cycling and cross- country skiing is part of the Capital Pathway, a large recreational pathway network in Ottawa. It borders Country place to the south, lying in the Blacks Rapids Creek ravine, and is connected to Country Place at several places. To the west, the pathway continues across Merivale Road, and to the east it connects to Blacks Rapids. The pathway meanders through wooded land and passes next to farm fields. *Blacks Rapids locks on the Rideau Canal and Victory Hill - This public recreational area is a short walk from Country Place, across Prince of Wales Drive. There are no schools or churches within the boundaries of Country Place, although St. Monica's Church is just across Merivale Road. The closest School is St. Monica's School, which is within walking distance and is part of the Ottawa Catholic School Board. Other schools attended by children of Country Place include Meadowlands Public School, Sir Winston Churchill Public School, Merivale High School and St Pius X High School. Business On Merivale Road there is a small plaza containing several businesses. The community is 1.5 km south of the Nepean South Business Park, which contains a major oil terminal, and numerous other industrial enterprises. It is 3 km south of the Nepean Crossroads retail area where there are many big box stores, including Costco, Canadian Tire and Rona. Additional large retail establishments lie further to the north. There are no restaurants in the community currently. Within walking distance on Prince of Wales Drive there is a Tim Horton's, and the Restaurant at the Ramada Hotel.

Retrieved from 'Moneylife' on 31 July 2013 The scheme was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana on 25 September 2015. Background The basic idea behind this scheme was to form SHG groups and help them to start some entrepreneurial activities but later SHG group failed. Mission, principles, and values A model self-help group demonstrating at a seminar in Maharashtra. The core belief of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is that the poor have innate capabilities and a strong desire to come out of poverty. They are entrepreneurial, an essential coping mechanism to survive under conditions of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful livelihoods and enable them to come out of poverty. =Mission= \\"To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor.\\" =Guiding Principles= * Poor have a strong desire to come out of poverty, and they have innate capabilities . * An external dedicated and sensitive support structure is required to induce the social mobilization, institution building and empowerment process. * Facilitating knowledge dissemination, skill building, access to credit, access to marketing, and access to other livelihoods services enables them to enjoy a portfolio of sustainable livelihoods. =Values= The core values which guide all the activities under NRLM are as follows: * Inclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes * Transparency and accountability of all processes and institutions. * Ownership and key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages ‚Äì planning, implementation, and, monitoring Approach In order to build, support and sustain livelihood of the poor, NRLM will harness their capability and complement them with capacities (information, knowledge, skill, tools, finance and collectivization), so that the poor can deal with the external world. NRLM works on three pillars ‚Äì enhancing and expanding existing livelihoods options of the poor; building skills for the job market outside; and nurturing self-employed and entrepreneurs. Dedicated support structures build and strengthen the institutional platforms of the poor. These platforms, with the support of their built-up human and social capital, offer a variety of livelihoods services to their members across the value-chains of key products and services of the poor. These services include financial and capital services, production and productivity enhancement services that include technology, knowledge, skills and inputs, market linkages etc. The interested rural BPL youth would be offered skill development after counseling and matching the aptitude with the job requirements, and placed in jobs that are remunerative. Self-employed and entrepreneurial oriented poor would be provided skills and financial linkages and nurtured to establish and grow with micro-enterprises for products and services in demand. These platforms also offer space for convergence and partnerships with a variety of stakeholders, by building an enabling environment for poor to access their rights and entitlements, public services and innovations. The aggregation of the poor, through their institutions, reduces transaction costs to the individual members, makes their livelihoods more viable and accelerates their journey out of poverty.} NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables: (a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans. (b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery. (c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector. (d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios. The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences. The plans will not only be demand driven, they will also be dynamic. Criticism NRLM is one of the major programme run by Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). But it has some serious shortcomings.http://www.smeworld.org/story/micro-finance/national-rural- livelihood-mission-nrlm.php. Retrieved from 'SME World' on 31 July 2013 # Prof. Malcolm Harper notes three aspects with regard to using SHG groups:'1) Groups take time, lots of it, and we have always said that poor women are very busy. 2) Groups tend to exclude individualist (sometimes they are called as entrepreneurs) who dare to be different, to do mad things like starting new types of businesses, which may even create jobs for others. 3) Men are generally bad at working in groups, and they take bigger risk and are less reliable than women, but when they do succeed they tend to create more jobs than women do, for the vast majority who prefer to employed than to be self- employed.' # In Andhra Pradesh (Indira Kranti Pathaam) and Kerala (Kudumbashree) the experiment with mass SHG programme has shown positive results, the same need not happen in other states. In these two states the programmes were led and supported by brilliant and committed officers and they had long tenure in that organisation/position. The same cannot be expected in all states.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was deemed significant for its commercial architecture as \\"a fine example of metal clad commercial construction with the original store fronts and other detailing still intact\\", and for its association with leading citizens H. P. Campbell and Rube Kelly, who developed machine works and foundry operations in Tonopah. This building was bought by them in 1915 to expand their automobile sales and service business.

This album contains songs that were recorded during the first phase of David Cassidy's musical career. All of the songs contained in this collection were recorded between 1970 and 1974 during the time he was starring in The Partridge Family television series. Of the eleven songs contained in this compilation, three songs were taken from Partridge Family albums and the song \\"If I Didn't Care\\" had only been released as a single in Europe and was not available in the U.S. prior to this album. Also note that Could It Be Forever was not issued as noted on the album. Instead it was the B-side of that song called Blind Hope. Clearly an error.
