Smith at McDonald Observatory Harlan James Smith (August 25, 1924 ‚Äì October 17, 1991) was an American astronomer. He served as director of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory from 1963 to 1989, where, among other accomplishments, he initiated the construction of the Harlan J. Smith Telescope, a 2.7-meter (107-inch) refractor now bearing his name . He came to McDonald Observatory as director in 1963, when he was also named chair of the University of Texas Astronomy Department in Austin, Texas. McDonald Observatory itself is located 440 miles west of Austin, in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. As head of the observatory, Smith's first major act was to obtain the funds needed to build the 2.7m telescope. Toward that end, he persuaded NASA the telescope was needed in support of space missions to the planets. The telescope brought new life to the observatory and helped recruit young faculty members, establishing McDonald as key player in the exploration of the solar system. In 1991, Smith received the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal \\"for a lifetime of service to the astronomy and space communities.\\" From 1966 until 1970, Smith was a member of the Committee on the Large Space Telescope, an ad hoc group formed by the National Academy of Sciences, the work of which resulted in the Hubble Space Telescope. He also was the chairperson of the NASA Space Science Board from 1977 until 1980, and there helped propose NASA's Great Observatories program. Smith was an enthusiastic proponent of educating the public on astronomy, and provided the support needed to develop the syndicated radio program StarDate. He also developed \\"The Story of the Universe\\", a series of educational films. He was also a proponent of international cooperation, particularly with China which he visited several times. He served as co-editor of the Astronomical Journal as well as acting secretary for the American Astronomical Society. Smith retired as McDonald Observatory's director in 1989. Afterwards, he served as the Edward Randall Jr., MD, Centennial Professor of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. Smith was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Paul and Anna McGregor Smith. While attending Wheeling High School he was named first runner up in the \\"Westinghouse National Science Talent Search\\". From 1943 until the end of World War II he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps, performing weather observation. Following the war he attended Harvard University, earning a B.A. in 1949. In 1950 he married Joan Greene, and by 1951 had earned his M.S. degree from Harvard. He began teaching at the astronomy department at Yale University in 1953, but still completed his Ph.D. from Harvard by 1955. During his career he studied variable stars, the radio emission from planets, as well as photometry and astronomical instruments. With Dorrit Hoffleit, he was the first to observe the optical variability of quasars, and discovered a class of variable stars known as Delta Scuti variables. Smith died in 1991 due to complications related to cancer. He was survived by his wife and four children, along with their grandchildren.

The series recounts the early adventures of Kryptonian Clark Kent as he adjusts to life in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, during the years before he becomes Superman. The sixth season comprises 22 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 17, 2007, marking the first season to air on the newly formed The CW television network. Regular cast members during season six include Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, Erica Durance, Allison Mack, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole. Season six key story arcs involve Clark (Welling) trying to recapture several escaped criminals from the Phantom Zone, the destinies of Lionel (Glover) and Lex (Rosenbaum) following the aftermath of Lex's possession by Zod and Lionel's adoption as the emissary of Jor-El, and the introductions of DC Comics characters Jimmy Olsen, Oliver Queen and Martian Manhunter, played by Aaron Ashmore, Justin Hartley, and Phil Morris respectively. Other key storylines involve Lana and Lex's marriage, as well as Lex's secret 33.1 projects. Smallville's Season six slipped in the ratings, averaging 4.1 million viewers weekly. It was nominated for an Emmy Award, among other awards, in the category of Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series for the episode \\"Zod\\". Episodes Tie-ins In a promotional tie-in with Sprint, Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles was released. The six-episode CGI series chronicled the early life of Oliver Queen. According to Lisa Gregorian, Executive Vice President of worldwide marketing at Warner Bros. Television Group, these promotional tie-ins were ways to get fans more connected to the show. On April 19, 2007, a tie-in with Toyota promoting their new Yaris featured an online comic strip as interstitial programs during new episodes of Smallville, titled Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom. The interactive comic was based on the episode \\"Justice\\", which follows the adventures of Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone, and Arthur Curry‚Äîthe initial members of the \\"Justice League\\" in Smallville‚Äîas they seek to destroy all of LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate alongside the fictional team, in an effort to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five of the episodes while working with a team of artists on the illustrations. The plot for each comic episode was given to Nilson as the production crew for Smallville was filming their current television episode. Artist Steve Scott drew comic book panels, which were then sent to a group called Motherland. That group reviewed the drawings and told Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay. This allowed for multiple objects to be moved in and out of the same frame. Awards The sixth season was awarded Leo Awards in multiple categories. Make-up artist Natalie Cosco was awarded the Leo Award for Best Make-Up for her work on the episodes \\"Hydro\\" and \\"Wither\\". The show itself won Best Dramatic Series; James Marshall won Best Direction for \\"Zod\\"; Caroline Cranston won Best Costume Design for her work on \\"Arrow\\", and James Philpott won Best Production Design for \\"Justice\\". The American Society of Cinematographers honored the series with an award for the work done on \\"Arrow\\", and with an award for Glen Winter for his work on \\"Noir\\". Mack won Best Sidekick for the second year in a row when she took home the award in the 2007 Teen Choice Awards. The series was recognized by the Visual Effects Society with a 2007 VES Award nomination for Outstanding Visual Effects in the episode \\"Zod\\". The VES recognized the season in 2008, nominating \\"Justice\\" for Outstanding Compositing in a Broadcast Program or Commercial. In 2007, the sound effects and foley teams were nominated for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for their work on \\"Zod\\". David Moxness won the American Society of Cinematographers Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography Award for his work on \\"Arrow\\". In the 33rd Annual Saturn Awards, the show was nominated for Best Dramatic Television Series, as well as a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Allison Mack.

It is a popular benchmark used in the measurement of an entity's (person or corporation) ability to produce enough cash to cover its debt (including lease) payments. The higher this ratio is, the easier it is to obtain a loan. The phrase is also used in commercial banking and may be expressed as a minimum ratio that is acceptable to a lender; it may be a loan condition. Breaching a DSCR covenant can, in some circumstances, be an act of default. Uses In corporate finance, DSCR refers to the amount of cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt, including sinking fund payments.DSCR finance term by the Free Online Dictionary In personal finance, DSCR refers to a ratio used by bank loan officers in determining debt servicing ability. In commercial real estate finance, DSCR is the primary measure to determine if a property will be able to sustain its debt based on cash flow. In the late 1990s and early 2000s banks typically required a DSCR of at least 1.2, but more aggressive banks would accept lower ratios, a risky practice that contributed to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. A DSCR over 1 means that (in theory, as calculated to bank standards and assumptions) the entity generates sufficient cash flow to pay its debt obligations. A DSCR below 1.0 indicates that there is not enough cash flow to cover loan payments. In certain industries where non-recourse project finance is used, a Debt Service Reserve Account is commonly used to ensure that loan repayment can be met even in periods with DSCR<1.0 Corality Debt Service Coverage Ratio Tutorial Calculation In general, it is calculated by: : \\\\text{DSCR} = \\\\text{Net Operating Income} / \\\\text{Debt Service} where: :\\\\text{Adj. EBITDA} = \\\\text{Gross Operating Revenue} - \\\\text{Operating Expenses} :\\\\text{Debt Service} = \\\\text{Principal Repayment} + \\\\text{Interest Payments} + \\\\text{Lease Payments} https://propertymetrics.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-debt-service-coverage- ratio-dscr/ To calculate an entity's debt coverage ratio, you first need to determine the entity's net operating income (NOI). NOI is the difference between gross revenue and operating expenses. NOI is meant to reflect the true income of an entity or an operation without or before financing. Thus, not included in operating expenses are financing costs (e.g. interests from loans), personal income tax of owners/investors, capital expenditure and depreciation. Debt Service are costs and payments related to financing. Interests and lease payments are true costs resulting from taking loans or borrowing assets. Paying down the principle of a loan does not change the net equity/liquidation value of an entity; however, it reduces the cash an entity processes (in exchange of decreasing loan liability or increasing equity in an asset). Thus, by accounting for principle payments, DSCR reflects the cash flow situation of an entity. For example, if a property has a debt coverage ratio of less than one, the income that property generates is not enough to cover the mortgage payments and the property's operating expenses. A property with a debt coverage ratio of .8 only generates enough income to pay for 80 percent of the yearly debt payments. However, if a property has a debt coverage ratio of more than 1, the property does generate enough revenue to cover annual debt payments. For example, a property with a debt coverage ratio of 1.5 generates enough income to pay all of the annual debt expenses, all of the operating expenses and actually generates fifty percent more income than is required to pay these bills. A DSCR of less than 1 would mean a negative cash flow. A DSCR of less than 1, say .95, would mean that there is only enough net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments. For example, in the context of personal finance, this would mean that the borrower would have to delve into his or her personal funds every month to keep the project afloat. Generally, lenders frown on a negative cash flow, but some allow it if the borrower has strong outside income.Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) on Investopedia Typically, most commercial banks require the ratio of 1.15‚Äì1.35 times (net operating income or NOI / annual debt service) to ensure cash flow sufficient to cover loan payments is available on an ongoing basis. =Example= Let's say Mr. Jones is looking at an investment property with a net operating income of $36,000 and an annual debt service of $30,000. The debt coverage ratio for this property would be 1.2 and Mr. Jones would know the property generates 20 percent more than is required to pay the annual mortgage payment. The Debt Service Ratio is also typically used to evaluate the quality of a portfolio of mortgages. For example, on June 19, 2008, a popular US rating agency, Standard & Poors, reported that it lowered its credit rating on several classes of pooled commercial mortgage pass-through certificates originally issued by Bank of America. The rating agency stated in a press release that it had lowered the credit ratings of four certificates in the Bank of America Commercial Mortgage Inc. 2005-1 series, stating that the downgrades \\"reflect the credit deterioration of the pool\\". They further go on to state that this downgrade resulted from the fact that eight specific loans in the pool have a debt service coverage (DSC) below 1.0x, or below one times. The Debt Service Ratio, or debt service coverage, provides a useful indicator of financial strength. Standard & Poors reported that the total pool consisted, as of June 10, 2008, of 135 loans, with an aggregate trust balance of $2.052 billion. They indicate that there were, as of that date, eight loans with a DSC of lower than 1.0x. This means that the net funds coming in from rental of the commercial properties are not covering the mortgage costs. Now, since no one would make a loan like this initially, a financial analyst or informed investor will seek information on what the rate of deterioration of the DSC has been. You want to know not just what the DSC is at a particular point in time, but also how much it has changed from when the loan was last evaluated. The S&P; press release tells us this. It indicates that of the eight loans which are \\"underwater\\", they have an average balance of $10.1 million, and an average decline in DSC of 38% since the loans were issued. And there is still more. Since there are a total of 135 loans in the pool, and only eight of them are underwater, with a DSC of less than 1, the obvious question is: what is the total DSC of the entire pool of 135 loans? The Standard and Poors press release provides this number, indicating that the weighted average DSC for the entire pool is 1.76x, or 1.76 times. Again, this is just a snapshot now. The key question that DSC can help you answer, is this better or worse, from when all the loans in the pool were first made? The S&P; press release provides this also, explaining that the original weighted average DSC for the entire pool of 135 loans was 1.66x, or 1.66 times. In this way, the DSC (debt service coverage) ratio provides a way to assess the financial quality, and the associated risk level, of this pool of loans, and shows the surprising result that despite some loans experiencing DSC below 1, the overall DSC of the entire pool has improved, from 1.66 times to 1.76 times. This is pretty much what a good loan portfolio should look like, with DSC improving over time, as the loans are paid down, and a small percentage, in this case 6%, experiencing DSC ratios below one times, suggesting that for these loans, there may be trouble ahead. And of course, just because the DSCR is less than 1 for some loans, this does not necessarily mean they will default. =Pre-Tax Provision Method= Income taxes present a special problem to DSCR calculation and interpretation. While, in concept, DSCR is the ratio of cash flow available for debt service to required debt service, in practice - because interest is a tax-deductible expense and principal is not - there is no one figure that represents an amount of cash generated from operations that is both fully available for debt service and the only cash available for debt service. While Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is an appropriate measure of a company's ability to make interest- only payments (assuming that expected change in working capital is zero), EBIDA (without the \\"T\\") is a more appropriate indicator of a company's ability to make required principal payments. Ignoring these distinctions can lead to DSCR values that overstate or understate a company's debt service capacity. The Pre-Tax Provision Method provides a single ratio that expresses overall debt service capacity reliably given these challenges. Debt Service Coverage Ratio as calculated using the Pre-Tax Provision Method answers the following question: How many times greater was the company's EBITDA than its critical EBITDA value, where critical EBITDA is that which just covers its Interest obligations + Principal obligations + Tax Expense assuming minimum sufficient income + Other necessary expenditures not treated as accounting expenses, like dividends and CAPEX. The DSCR calculation under the Pre-Tax Provision Method is EBITDA / (Interest + Pre-tax Provision for Post-Tax Outlays), where Pre-tax Provision for Post-tax Outlays is the amount of pretax cash that must be set aside to meet required post-tax outlays, i.e., CPLTD + Unfinanced CAPEX + Dividends. The provision can be calculated as follows: If noncash expenses (depreciation + depletion + amortization) > post-tax outlays, then Pretax provision for post-tax outlays = Post-tax outlays For example, if a company's post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $90M and $10M in unfinanced CAPEX, and its noncash expenses are $100M, then the company can apply $100M of cash inflow from operations to post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $100M cash inflow. In this case, the pretax cash that the borrower must set aside for post-tax outlays would simply be $100M. If post-tax outlays > noncash expenses, then Pretax provision for post-tax outlays = Noncash expenses + (post-tax outlays - noncash expenses) / (1- income tax rate) For example, if post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $100M and noncash expenses are $50M, then the borrower can apply $50M of cash inflow from operations directly against $50M of post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $50M inflow, but the company must set aside $77M (assuming a 35% income tax rate) to meet the remaining $50M of post-tax outlays. This company's pretax provision for post- tax outlays = $50M + $77M = $127M.

Sun Quan was impressed when he heard of Pan Zhang's actions and he promoted Pan to Lieutenant-General (), put him in charge of more troops. and ordered him to garrison at Banzhou ().(ÂêàËÇ•‰πãÂΩπÔºåÂºµÈÅºÂ•ÑËá≥ÔºåË´∏Â∞á‰∏çÂÇôÔºåÈô≥Ê≠¶È¨¨Ê≠ªÔºåÂÆãË¨ô„ÄÅÂæêÁõõÁöÜÊä´Ëµ∞ÔºåÁíãË∫´Ê¨°Âú®ÂæåÔºå‰æøÈ¶≥ÈÄ≤ÔºåÊ©´È¶¨Êñ¨Ë¨ô„ÄÅÁõõÂÖµËµ∞ËÄÖ‰∫å‰∫∫ÔºåÂÖµÁöÜÈÇÑÊà∞„ÄÇÊ¨äÁîöÂ£Ø‰πãÔºåÊãúÂÅèÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈÅÇÈ†òÁôæÊ†°ÔºåÂ±ØÂçäÂ∑û„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. Wars against Liu Bei In 219, Pan Zhang participated in a campaign led by Sun Quan's general L√º Meng to seize control of Jing Province from Guan Yu, a general under Liu Bei. Pan Zhang and Zhu Ran blocked Guan Yu's retreat routes and stationed at Jiashi () when they reached Linju County (Ëá®Ê≤ÆÁ∏£; present-day Yuan'an County, Hubei). Guan Yu, along with his son Guan Ping and subordinate Zhao Lei (), were captured alive in an ambush laid by Ma Zhong (), a Major () under Pan Zhang. In recognition of Pan Zhang's contributions, Sun Quan split Yidu and Zigui counties to form Guling Commandery () and appointed Pan as the Administrator () of the commandery, in addition to promoting him to General Who Inspires Might () and enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Liyang ().

In late 221, Liu Bei launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province, leading to the Battle of Xiaoting of 221‚Äì222. Pan Zhang participated in the battle under the leadership of Lu Xun, the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces. After enduring some initial defeats and months of stalemate, Lu Xun eventually ordered a large-scale counterattack with the use of fire, inflicting a crushing defeat on Liu Bei's forces. During the attack, Pan Zhang's subordinates killed Feng Xi, an officer under Liu Bei, as well as several enemy soldiers. For his achievements, Pan Zhang was further promoted to General Who Pacifies the North () and appointed as the Administrator of Xiangyang Commandery.(ÂäâÂÇôÂá∫Â§∑ÈôµÔºåÁíãËàáÈô∏ÈÅúÂπ∂ÂäõÊãí‰πãÔºåÁíãÈÉ®‰∏ãÊñ¨ÂÇôË≠∑ËªçÈ¶ÆÁøíÁ≠âÔºåÊâÄÊÆ∫ÂÇ∑ÁîöË°ÜÔºåÊãúÂπ≥ÂåóÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅË•ÑÈôΩÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. Wars against Wei In Pan Zhang's later years, he was tasked with defending Sun Quan's territories from invasions by the state of Cao Wei, which was founded by Cao Cao's son and successor, Cao Pi. In 223, Cao Pi sent Zhang He, Xu Huang, Cao Zhen, Xiahou Shang and others to lead armies to attack Nan Commandery () with the objective of capturing the commandery capital Jiangling County, which was defended by Zhu Ran. Xiahou Shang sent 30,000 troops to build pontoon bridges for crossing over the Yangtze River to Bailizhou (), an island stretching over 100 li in the river around that area. Zhuge Jin and Yang Can () wanted to lead their men to defend the island but were unable to locate the Wei troops' crossing points. Pan Zhang told them, \\"The Wei army's morale is very high at the beginning and the tide is low, so we shouldn't fight them yet.\\" They moved to about 50 li upstream, where Pan Zhang ordered his men to collect thousands of bundles of reeds, attach them onto some large rafts, and set them on fire. The flaming rafts were then allowed to sail downstream and they destroyed the enemy's pontoon bridges. Xiahou Shang sensed that he was in danger of being isolated so he withdrew his forces from the island before his retreat route could be sealed. Pan Zhang moved to Lukou (Èô∏Âè£; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) and stationed there. Sun Quan praised Pan Zhang for his efforts and promoted him to General of the Right ().(È≠èÂ∞áÂ§è‰æØÂ∞öÁ≠âÂúçÂçóÈÉ°ÔºåÂàÜÂâçÈÉ®‰∏âËê¨‰∫∫‰ΩúÊµÆÊ©ãÔºåÊ∏°ÁôæÈáåÊ¥≤‰∏äÔºåË´∏ËëõÁëæ„ÄÅÊ•äÁ≤≤‰∏¶ÊúÉÂÖµËµ¥ÊïëÔºåÊú™Áü•ÊâÄÂá∫ÔºåËÄåÈ≠èÂÖµÊó•Ê∏°‰∏çÁµï„ÄÇÁíãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈ≠èÂã¢ÂßãÁõõÔºåÊ±üÊ∞¥ÂèàÊ∑∫ÔºåÊú™ÂèØËàáÊà∞„ÄÇ„Äç‰æøÂ∞áÊâÄÈ†òÔºåÂà∞È≠è‰∏äÊµÅ‰∫îÂçÅÈáåÔºå‰ºêËë¶Êï∏ÁôæËê¨ÊùüÔºåÁ∏õ‰ΩúÂ§ßÁ≠èÔºåÊ¨≤È†ÜÊµÅÊîæÁÅ´ÔºåÁáíÊïóÊµÆÊ©ã„ÄÇ‰ΩúÁ≠èÈÅ©Áï¢Ôºå‰º∫Ê∞¥Èï∑Áï∂‰∏ãÔºåÂ∞ö‰æøÂºïÈÄÄ„ÄÇÁíã‰∏ãÂÇôÈô∏Âè£„ÄÇÊ¨äÁ®±Â∞äËôüÔºåÊãúÂè≥Â∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55.

Templo de Santa M√≥nica in Colonia Del Valle, Mexico City F√©lix Candela Outeri√±o (; January 27, 1910 ‚Äì December 7, 1997) was a Spanish and Mexican architect who was born in Madrid and at the age of 26, emigrated to Mexico, acquiring double nationality. He is known for his significant role in the development of Mexican architecture and structural engineering. Candela‚Äôs major contribution to architecture was the development of thin shells made out of reinforced concrete, popularly known as cascarones. He was one of Santiago Calatrava's teachers, and has had a great influence on his works. Early life Felix Candela was born in Madrid, Spain in 1910. In 1927 Candela enrolled in La Escuela Superior de Arquitectura (Madrid Superior Technical School of Architecture), graduating in 1935; at which time Candela traveled to Germany to further study architecture. Early after he started classes, he developed a very keen sense of geometry and started teaching other students in private lessons. In his junior year, his visual intelligence and his descriptive geometric and trigonometric talent helped him catch the eye of Luis Vegas. Vegas was his material strength professor, and gave Candela the honorary title of ‚ÄúLuis Vegas‚Äô Helper‚Äù. While ‚Äúhelping‚Äù Vegas, Candela entered many architecture competitions and won most of them. Unlike many of his peers, Candela didn‚Äôt show intellectual or aesthetic efforts in school. He didn‚Äôt even like pure mathematics. When Candela was a student in Madrid, the schools taught the theory of elasticity where Candela assisted the professors and even tutored other students. His studies ended very quickly when the Spanish civil war began in 1936. When Candela returned to Spain to fight, he sided with the republic and fought against Franco. Candela became a Captain of Engineers for the Spanish republic after a short period of time. Unfortunately, while participating in the civil war, Candela was imprisoned in the Perpignan Concentration camp in Perpignan, France until the end of the war in 1939. Candela had fought against Franco; therefore he could not stay in the new Spain as long as Franco was the head of state. After his name was selected with a few hundred other prisoners, Candela was put onto a ship bound for Mexico, where he would start his career. He landed in Acapulco later that year. As an expert of paraboloid and hyperbolic geometry, he was drawn to experiment on a series of residential and commercial shell-shaped structures since the beginning of his career. Candela evaluated both the artistic and the cost-saving aspects of this kind of design choice. Candela married Eladia Martin when he moved to Mexico from Spain; there, they raised a family. In his early life, Felix was active in sports, particularly rugby and skiing. Thin- shell structures Candela worked very hard during his lifetime to prove the real nature and potential reinforced concrete had in structural engineering. Reinforced concrete is extremely efficient in a dome or shell like shape. This shape eliminates tensile forces in the concrete. He also looked to solve problems by the simplest means possible. In regard to shell design, he tended to rely on the geometric properties of the shell for analysis, instead of complex mathematical means and he followed the works of Eduardo Torroja in Europe and Guillermo Gonzalez Zuleta in America. Around 1950 when Candela's company went to design laminar structures, he started researching journals and engineering articles for as much information as he could find. From this, he started questioning the behaviour of reinforced concrete with the elastic assumptions and concluded they are in total disagreement with each other. Candela has said on more than one occasion that the analysis of a structure is a sort of \\"hobby\\" to him. Mexico: 1939-1968 F√©lix Candela worked as an architect upon his arrival in Mexico until 1949 when he started to engineer many concrete structures utilizing his well-known thin-shell design. Candela did most of his work in Mexico throughout the 1950s and into the late 60s. He was responsible for more than 300 works and 900 projects in this time period. Many of his larger projects were given to him by the Mexican government, such as the Cosmic Rays Pavilion. In 1956, Mexican President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines said ‚ÄúNothing could be more serious than to sit in the shade of the buildings we are about to build,‚Äù foreshadowing the many construction projects to come. Ruiz Cortines came up with a budget to enable his construction declaration to come true, requesting ‚Ç±81,200,000 (pesos) more funding than was used in 1955. Luckily for Candela, ‚Ç±20,300,000 (pesos) of this funding was to go towards public works. Candela also benefited from the budget implemented by Ruiz Cortines in the area of education. Candela became a professor in Mexico, which is what he did for the remainder of his career. Felix moved to the United States and taught at University of Illinois at Chicago from 1971-1978. University of Illinois at Chicago Circle: 1971-1978 Candela was hired as a Professor of Architecture at the university's Chicago Circle campus (now University of Illinois at Chicago) on September 1, 1971, a position he held until 1978.F√©lix Candel, 064-01 Faculty and Alumni Biography Files, UIC Archives, University of Illinois at Chicago Works Source: Fausto Giovannardi, ed.: Felix Candela, Builder of DreamsFausto Giovannardi, ed.: Felix Candela, Builder of Dreams *1951, Pabell√≥n de Rayos C√≥smicos (\\"Pavilion of Cosmic Rays\\"), National Autonomous University of Mexico, with Jorge Gonz√°lez Reyna *1952, Almacenes de las Aduanas (customs warehouses), Pantaco, Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, with Carlos Recamier *1953-1957 Iglesia de la Medalla de la Virgen Milagrosa, Colonia Narvarte, Mexico City *1954-1955 F√°brica Celestino Fern√°ndez, Colonia Vallejo, Mexico City *1955, covering for Mexican Stock Exchange, Mexico City, with Enrique de La Mora Lopez and Fernando Carmona *1955-1956 Quiosco de M√∫sica, Santa Fe. *Churches in Mexico City: 1955 El Atillo church, Coyoac√°n; 1955 San Antonio de las Huertas, Tacuba; 1959 San Vicente de Paul, 1963 Santa Monica Lopez of Carmona; all with Enrique de La Mora y Palomar and Fernando Lopez Carmona *1955-56: Municipal markets in Coyoac√°n, Azcapotzalco and An√°huac, Mexico City with Pedro Ramirez V√†zquez and Rafael Mijares *1956-1957 Nightclub La Jacaranda, Acapulco *1956: Hotel Casino de la Selva, Cuernavaca, Mexico (demolished 2001) *1958, Los Manatiales restaurant, Xochimilco, Mexico City, with Joaqu√≠n √Ålvarez Ordonez *1958, Chapel Lomas de Cuernavaca, Cuernavaca, Mexico *1959-1960, Planta embotelladora Bacardi, Cuautitl√°n, near Mexico City *1959, Capilla de Abierta Palmira in Cuernavaca with Rosell and Manuel Guillermo Larrosa *1959, San Jos√© Obrero church Monterrey, with Enrique de La Mora y Palomar and Fernando Lopez Carmona *1962, Aula Magna at The Anglo Mexican Foundation, with Enrique de La Mora Colonia San Rafael *1962-3, Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Madrid, with Enrique de La Mora y Palomar and Fernando Lopez Carmona *1966, Parroquia del Se√±or del Campo Florido, Mexico City *1968, Palacio de los Deportes, Mexico City, built for the 1968 Summer Olympics, with A.

The device was intended as a standalone Internet access device, running a specialized operating system which limited it to the Virgin Connect ISP. It was discontinued on November 15, 2000. The remaining Webplayer hardware was liquidated and embraced by the hardware hacker community. The Virgin Connect service was innovative -- for $50, a user would get the Webplayer and unlimited dial-up Internet access (provided through Prodigy) for three years. However, the Webplayer displayed advertisements while the user was online. Hardware The Webplayer is essentially a compact x86 PC and was manufactured by Acer under contract by Boundless Technologies and is also known as the Boundless iBrow. Input came through an infrared keyboard with an integrated trackball, and the webplayer came with a modem for connecting to the Internet. The Webplayer is powered by a 200 MHz Cyrix MediaGX CPU, 64 MB of SO-DIMM RAM, and a 48 MB M-Systems Disk-On-Chip 2000 for storage. It included two USB ports and contained a Mini PCI Type IIIB slot and 44-pin IDE header inside. CompactFlash, VGA, and PS/2 keyboard and mouse headers are present on the motherboard, but the physical connector is not included. Hacking After the demise of official support, the Webplayer drew the attention of computer enthusiasts. A grassroots Co-Op effort was created to purchase a lot of Webplayers from a liquidator, with over 50 members signing up. Eventually, the units were shipped out at $100 each and the hacking began. The Virgin operating system was locked to dial into Virgin Online, but a password-protected setup screen was available. A user discovered the scheme and created a utility to guess the rotating password frequently enough to allow an owner to reprogram the device to call into any ISP. However, the experience of using the Virgin OS was not what users wanted, so more serious hacking attempts quickly began. Since the Webplayer is architecturally similar to a typical x86 PC and included an IDE header, initial attention was focused on accessing the password-protected system BIOS. An insider leaked the password (\\"schwasck\\") and the device was quickly converted into a full-fledged PC. Users could simply purchase a 44-pin IDE cable and hard disk drive and run any PC-compatible operating system. The next efforts included creating a version of Microsoft Windows that would fit in the 48 MB Disk-On-Chip device. This was quickly accomplished, with a version of 98lite widely distributed. Attempts to create a specialized Linux distribution were less successful, since the Webplayer included specialized graphics hardware which was not well- supported at the time. Users eventually turned to the Mini-PCI slot, adding Ethernet and 802.11 adapters designed for notebooks. These proved far more reliable than the originally-used USB Ethernet adapters, as the Webplayer's USB hardware was not entirely stable. Other popular modifications included increasing the system RAM (it used a standard 144-pin PC100 SO-DIMM) and overclocking the CPU. Some users modified the Webplayer case to accept a built-in CD-ROM drive, Ethernet ports, and Wi-Fi antennas. Issues The Webplayer hardware proved to have a few stability issues: * The USB ports are somewhat unreliable with Ethernet adapters, though they seem to work well with storage and input devices * The audio system will distort unless the Line-In is muted * The display adapter is not well-supported and its VGA modes are incomplete * The ACPI/APM BIOS does not work well, with suspend and resume problems common See also * Internet appliance * i-Opener * 3Com Audrey References * * Category:Acer Inc. products Category:Information appliances Web player ","title":"Virgin Webplayer"},{"id":"4828043","text":"Zadarfest is a music festival held annually since 1993 in Zadar, Croatia.

A dispute at the Drury Lane Theatre bought the actress Sarah Thurmond and her husband to the theatre.Jane Girdham, ‚ÄòThurmond , Sarah (d. 1762)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2013 accessed 9 May 2015 With the passing of the Licensing Act of 1737, the theatre was forced to close. Giffard rented Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre briefly and then, with various political machinations, was able to reopen Goodman's Fields in 1740. The Winter's Tale was produced there in 1741 for the first time in over a century. The same year David Garrick made his successful d√©but as Richard III. He also staged plays of his own including the 1741 farce The Lying Valet. The theatre closed 27 May 1742 and did not re-open. It was pulled down in 1746, and a further theatre built on the site, this briefly showed drama before it was converted to a warehouse and burned down in 1809. During its heyday, the poet Gray noted in a letter to a friend, that \\"there are a dozen dukes of a night at Goodman's Fields sometimes\\". The Oxford Companion to the Theatre notes that there may have been an earlier theatre named Goodman's Fields Theatre in the area around 1703. References *location *Hartnoll, Phyllis, ed.

The label's credo was to be an artist- led label with all aspects of each release tailored to the artist. Twenty years later, this is still key to how World Circuit operate. World Circuit celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006 by releasing World Circuit Presents..., a 2-disc retrospective compilation album. In 2018, World Circuit was acquired by BMG Rights Management. History =1986 to 1999= In 1986, the label released its first albums, Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez's La Tremenda and Abd El Gadir Salim's Sounds of Sudan Volume One. World Circuit‚Äôs first taste of major success came in 1993 with the teaming of Ali Farka Tour√© and American guitarist Ry Cooder on the Grammy award-winning album, Talking Timbuktu. The album went on to sell over a million copies worldwide; an incredible feat for an album of its kind. During the mid-nineties World Circuit began working with new artists, who would go on to become long-time label stalwarts. Moving away from their usual Latin and West African bias, World Circuit released the album Rumba Argelina by Spanish group Radio Tarifa. Rumba Argelina propelled them to cult fame, becoming a sensation across Europe. Another artist to make an immediate impact was Senegalese multi-instrumentalist and singer Cheikh L√¥. The dreadlocked maverick‚Äôs debut album Ne La Thiass was produced by Youssou N‚ÄôDour, and is underpinned by indigenous Mbalax and Flamenco rhythms. In 1996, Cooder was invited to Havana, Cuba by British world-music producer Nick Gold of the World Circuit record label to record a session with two African High- life musicians from Mali in collaboration with Cuban musicians.\\"Interview with Ry Cooder in Los Angeles\\", by Betty Arcos, host, \\"The Global Village\\" Pacifica Radio 27 June 2000.

Nick Gold and World Circuit are also responsible for catapulting the Senegalese band Orchestra Baobab to world fame after its 2001 re-release of the 1982 record Pirates Choice in Europe (originally compiled and released by World Circuit in 1987).Frank Bessem, \\"Musiques d'Afrique: Orchestre Baobab\\", Webcitation.orgLucy Duran, \\"Orchestra Baobab,\\" World Music Central =2000 to 2009= Mand√© Sessions trilogy In the summer of 2004 the World Circuit team of Nick Gold and Jerry Boys travelled with a mobile studio to Mali to record a trilogy of albums at the Hotel Mand√©, Bamako. The first album in the series, In the Heart of the Moon, released in June 2005, is a collaboration between Ali Farka Tour√© and Toumani Diabat√© that went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Traditional World Music Album. Second in the series is Boulevard de l‚ÄôInd√©pendance by Toumani Diabat√©‚Äôs pan-African Symmetric Orchestra, composed of musicians (mostly griots) from across the old Mali Empire of west Africa, who play a mix of traditional instruments including the kora, djembe, balafon and bolombatto, as well as guitar and electronic keyboard. The third and final part of the Mand√© Sessions trilogy, Savane (released July 2006), was also the first posthumous Ali Farka Tour√© release. It was received with wide acclaim by professionals and fans alike and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category \\"Best Contemporary World Music Album\\". The panel of experts from the World Music Chart Europe (WMCE), a chart voted by the leading World Music specialists around Europe, chose Savane as their Album of the Year 2006, with the album topping the chart for three consecutive months (September to November 2006). The album has also been listed as No. 1 in the influential Metacritic‚Äôs \\"Best Albums of 2006\\" poll, and No. 5 in its all-time best reviewed albums. =2010 to present day= In February 2010, World Circuit released the successor to Ali Farka Tour√© and Toumani Diabat√©'s, In The Heart Of The Moon (2005), Ali and Toumani. Recorded over three afternoons at Livington Studios, London, in 2005, with contributions from Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez on bass, and produced by Nick Gold, it was Tour√©'s final studio album, and lasting legacy. In October 2010, World Circuit released Afrocubism's self- titled debut, a long-awaited collaboration between some of Cuba's and Mali's most esteemed musicians, including Eliades Ochoa, Bassekou Kouyate, Toumani Diabat√©, Lassana Diabat√© and Kasse Mandy Diabat√©. It was a collaboration which was initially intended to take place some 15 years earlier, but never arose as a result of visa complications. In December 2011 the album Afrocubism was nominated for a Grammy award in the category of Best Traditional World Music Album. Following Ali Farka Toure‚Äôs death from cancer in 2006, Toumani Diabat√© continued to record for World Circuit as a solo artist, releasing The Mand√© Variations, a classical-sounding album of solo kora in 2008, and duetting with his kora playing son Sidiki Diabate on 2014‚Äôs Toumani & Sidike. As time ran out for many of the veteran musicians World Circuit had recorded in its early years, the label brought young and previously unknown talent to the fore. Fatoumata Diawara‚Äôs 2011 debut Fatou introduced a new female voice to rival her fellow Malian singer Oumou Sangare, whom she had once backed. Mbongwana Star, a new seven piece band from the Democratic Republic of Congo released their debut album, From Kinshasa on World Circuit in 2015 and in 2017 the label released Ladilikan, a ground-breaking collaboration between Trio da Kali, comprising there young Malian musicians, and the Kronos Quartet. Produced by Nick Gold, the project was sponsored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The veterans of Orchestra Baobab also released a new album in 2017, Tribute To Ndiouga Dieng, and celebrated its release with a world tour in 2018.

In 1988 she received a master's degree in economics from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. She worked in universities in Hunan and Guangdong for several years. Later she became a newspaper editor in Shenzhen, Guangdong. She wrote many articles and several books on Chinese society and the Chinese economy. The Pitfalls of Modernization, her most famous book, sold over 100,000 copies in China and won acclaim from both the public and economists. She argues in Pitfalls that, as power has devolved to local government, local officials who at first favored reform later came to oppose further reform which might limit their discretion and so make it harder to trade power for money and money for power. In the latter part of Pitfalls she also discussed the revival of clan power in southern provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian. Her articles, which point to deep structural problems and declare that thoroughgoing political reform will be necessary if economic reform is to succeed, displeased some Chinese government officials. Consequently, she received more and more pressure in China, and on June 14, 2001, she left home and fled abroad. She now lives in the United States.

Hawaiian kii at Pu ªuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park Tiki statuette from the Marquesas In MƒÅori mythology, Tiki is the first man created by either T≈´matauenga or TƒÅne. He found the first woman, Marikoriko, in a pond; she seduced him and he became the father of Hine-kau-ataata. By extension, a tiki is a large or small wooden or stone carving in humanoid form, although this is a somewhat archaic usage in the MƒÅori language. Carvings similar to tikis and coming to represent deified ancestors are found in most Polynesian cultures. They often serve to mark the boundaries of sacred or significant sites. Religion In traditions from the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, the first human is a woman created by TƒÅne, god of forests and of birds. Usually her name is Hine- ahu-one. In other legends, TƒÅne makes the first man Tiki, then makes a wife for him. In some West Coast versions, Tiki himself, as a son of Rangi and Papa, creates the first human by mixing his own blood with clay, and TƒÅne then makes the first woman. Sometimes T≈´matauenga, the war god, creates Tiki. In another story the first woman is MƒÅrikoriko. Tiki marries her and their daughter is Hine-kau-ataata. In some traditions, Tiki is the penis of TƒÅne. In fact, Tiki is strongly associated with the origin of the reproductive act. In one story of Tiki among the many variants, Tiki was lonely and craved company. One day, seeing his reflection in a pool, he thought he had found a companion, and dived into the pool to seize it. The image shattered and Tiki was disappointed. He fell asleep and when he awoke he saw the reflection again. He covered the pool with earth and it gave birth to a woman. Tiki lived with her in serenity, until one day the woman was excited by an eel. Her excitement passed to Tiki and the first reproductive act resulted. =Names and epithets= Tiki statue shop, Hawaii John White names several Tiki or perhaps manifestations of Tiki in MƒÅori tradition: * Tiki-tohua, the progenitor of birds * Tiki-kapakapa, the progenitor of fish and of a bird, the tui * Tiki- auaha, the progenitor of humanity * Tiki-whakaeaea, the progenitor of the k≈´mara. =Elsewhere in Polynesia= The word appears as tiki in New Zealand MƒÅori, Cook Islands MƒÅori, Tuamotuan, and Marquesan; as tii in Tahitian, and as kii in Hawaiian. The word has not been recorded from the languages of Western Polynesia or in the Rapa Nui language. * In Hawaiian traditions the first man was Kumuhonua. He was made by KƒÅne, or by KƒÅne, K≈´, and Lono. His body was made by mixing red earth with saliva. He was made in the shape of KƒÅne, who carried the earth from which the man was made from the four corners of the world. A woman was made from one of his ribs Kanaloa was watching when KƒÅne made the first man, and he too made a man, but could not bring him to life. Kanaloa then said to KƒÅne, ‚ÄúI will take your man, and he will die.‚Äù And so death came upon mankind. * In Tahiti, Tii was the first man, and was made from red earth. The first woman was Ivi who was made from one of the bones (ivi) of Tii. * In the Marquesas Islands, there are various accounts. In one legend Atea and his wife created people. In another tradition Atanua and her father Atea brought forth humans. * In the Cook Islands, traditions also vary. At Rarotonga, Tiki is the guardian of the entrance to Avaiki, the underworld. Offerings were made to him as gifts for the departing soul of someone who is dying. At Mangaia, Tiki is a woman, the sister of Veetini, the first person to die a natural death. The entrance to Avaiki (the underworld) is called ‚Äòthe chasm of Tiki‚Äô. * According to Easter Island (Rapa Nui) legend, Hotu Matu'a, the first chief brought along a moai (other traditional sources mention two) symbolizing ancestors, which became the model for the large moai. Dr. Jo Anne van Tilburg of the Easter Island Statue Project at UCLA says that the first stone statues originated on Rapa Nui, although oral traditions do not support this. Others contend that the first statues originated in the Marquesas or the Austral Islands.

It linked Westland Row in Dublin with Kingstown Harbour (D√∫n Laoghaire) in County Dublin. The D&KR; was also notable for a number of other achievements besides being Ireland's first passenger railway: it operated an atmospheric railway for ten years; claimed the first use of a passenger tank engine and was the first railway company to build its own locomotives. On 30 June 1856 the Dublin and Wicklow Railway (D&WR;) took over operation of the line from the D&KR; with the D&KR; continuing to lease out the line. The D&WR; had formerly been known as the Waterford, Wicklow, Wexford and Dublin Railway (WWW&DR; or 3WS). It changed its name to the Dublin Wicklow and Wexford Railway (DW&WR;) in May 1860 and was ultimately renamed the Dublin and South Eastern Railway (D&SER;) in 1907, a name which was retained until the amalgamation of the D&KR; and D&SER; with the Great Southern Railways on 1 January 1925. As of 1974, its independent existence of over 90 years by a railway company was only exceeded in the British Isles by the Great Western Railway and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway. History =Beginnings= 1817 had seen the beginning of the construction of a new harbour at Dunleary village that soon began to attract traffic due to silting problems elsewhere around Dublin Bay. The name Kingstown was adopted after King George IV departed from the harbour in 1821. Proposals for canal or rail infrastructure links to Dublin were variously proposed through to the 1830s. James Pim took the initiative and commissioned a plan by Alexander Nimmo which was supported by other businessmen and presented as a petition to the House of Commons on 28 February 1831 for a rail line from near Trinity College to the west pier at the Royal Harbour of Kingstown under a company to be known as the D&KR.; A bill was presented and was progressing but was scuppered by a prorogation of parliament and an election. A fresh bill received Royal assent on 6 September 1831. A meeting of D&KR; subscribers on 25 November 1831 at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce included the submission of a long report which indicated that Westland Row was to be the Dublin terminus and that the enterprise was initially to focus on passenger traffic with a high train frequency. Thomas Pim was appointed Chairman. A key appointment was James Pim (Junior) as secretary and Murray notes his \\"great natural ability, tact, energy, and a valuable business experience\\". James Pim was appointed Treasurer in May 1832 and effectively functioned as General Manager. The position of clerk/secretary was awarded to Thomas Fleming Bergin who with his engineering background effectively controlled the operation of the railway. =Construction= The construction contract was awarded to William Dargan, with Charles Blacker Vignoles as engineer. Second Class Carriage of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, 1835 Lord Cloncurry's bridge, near Blackrock, 1834 The line began at Westland Row where the D&KR; made its headquarters and initially ran elevated reaching street level around the River Dodder. From Merrion the line ran on an embankment built across the strand to Blackrock which later led to the formation of Booterstown marsh. While rights for compulsory purchase were generally granted, this was not the case for two landowners who insisted on large cash compensations and in the case of Lord Cloncurry the building of a private footbridge over the line to a bathing area complete with a Romanesque temple, a short tunnel and a cutting to maintain his privacy. The construction contract was signed on 7 May 1833 and was completed in about 18 months. Thomas Grierson, the DW&WR; chief engineer commented in a presentation to the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland in 1887 that speed of construction was remarkably short and led to \\"many failures in masonry, bridges, etc.\\". The railway proved expensive to build, the final cost being under a little under ¬£60,000 per mile in total, Murray in 1938 commenting that this rate per mile was one of the highest ever. =Trials and first train= One of the earliest tests was with a horse pulling a single carriage carrying directors and friends on 31 July 1834; at that stage with only a single line laid throughout. The D&KR; claimed that trials expected in September were delayed due to the risks to labourers still working on the line. The first recorded train with invited passengers on 4 October 1834 was hauled by the engine Vauxhall and ran as far as the Williamstown Martello Tower at what is now Blackrock Park before returning. The engine Hibernia on 9 October 1834 hauled another train of invited passengers composed of eight carriages and in this case traversed the whole length of the line and back. Plans were made to introduce a service on 22 October 1834 but storms and flooding damaged the line including wrecking the bridge over the River Dodder and this led to delays for repairs. Newspaper advertisements of an hourly service and fares for one shilling, eight (old) pence and six pence for first, second and third class respectively indicated the service was to start on Wednesday 17 December 1834. At 9 O'clock on the appointed date the locomotive Hibernia departed with the first train of the day from Westland Row. Throughout the day a total of nine trains of between eight and nine carriages were run, all \\"full to overflowing\\", and with a total of almost 5,000 fare paying passengers conveyed. A timetabled regular service was introduced from January 1835. =1837 Kingstown extension= When the plan was prepared for the original line, the D&KR; expected that a new wharf was to be completed near their planned terminus at the West Pier at the old harbour. However, Liverpool and Holyhead packets had begun using a jetty at the East Pier, and the location of the new wharf was moved eastward to avail of the deeper water needed for steamships; Victoria Wharf opened in 1837. Thus the D&KR; had a need, even as it was being built, to extend towards the East Pier and there were thoughts of extending to Dalkey and even to Bray. An 1833 bill to extend to Dalkey evoked strong opposition from many quarters including canal proponents and local property owners, with Thomas Gresham making the strongest impact. With the failure of the previous bill and following careful negotiations, Pim was able to present and get passed a new Act in May 1834 for an extension to Kingstown only. This cut across and isolated a good section of the Old Harbour, ran also beside the existing Dalkey Quarry tramway and also required demolition of a Martello tower and battery in May 1835 before Dargan started work on the extension in May 1836. The line extension to station's current location was announced complete on 13 May 1837, and a directors' special train ran in 13 minutes from Westland Row on that date. =Dalkey atmospheric= With the substantial construction of most of the pier at Kingstown complete by 1836, the D&KR; made an unsuccessful attempt in 1838 to apply to use one track of the Kingstown to Dalkey Quarry stone tramway for horse-drawn trams to Dalkey. In 1842 James Pim observed the Samudas and Clegg demonstration atmospheric railway at Wormwood Scrubs. With both parties agreeing the mutual advantages of a commercial trial of an atmospheric system between Kingstown and Dalkey and funding assisted by the Board of Public Works, transportation trials began on 18 August 1843 with the full public opening on 29 March 1844. The atmospheric operated for about 10 years, and while having some advantages there were ultimately cost and other disadvantages and the operation of the service by the small princess locomotive during a bad breakdown between 23 December 1848 and 5 February 1849 demonstrated the potential of working the line by conventional locomotives. The final atmospheric train ran on 12 April 1854 when the D&KR; handed the line to the D&WR; as part of a 1846 agreement for the D&KR; to lease their line. The D&WR;, who began running services from Bray to Dalkey and Dublin Harcourt Street on 10 July 1854 then rebuilt the Dalkey Kingstown section to , removing the height restriction, and re-opening in October 1855. =July 1856 operational handover= The D&KR; lease to the D&WR; came into operation on 1 July 1856, with the D&KR; receiving compensation for all operational equipment. Some engines had already been converted to , and the D&WR; proceeded to convert the whole line from to the compatible with the rest of the D&WR.; Track gauge conversion was done in 1857 at a cost of ¬£38,000. =Aftermath= Conversion to enabled the D&KR; to begin a Westland Row to service which the former D&KR; section became part of. The D&KR;, who were now lessors only, initially believed the D&WR; were favouring services on the Harcourt Street Line but this resolved over time. May 1897 saw a Wexford mail train service terminating at Westland Row rather than Harcourt street, this being the start of services south of Bray. The extension to Carlisle Pier was opened in 1859. The opening of the Dublin Loop Line in 1891 enabled commuter services to be extended to Amiens street. On the 1 January 1925 grouping, both the D&KR; and D&SER; were absorbed into the GSR. Westland Row became the Dublin station for the former Midland Great Western Railway main line services upon the closure of in 1937. Ownership moved to CI√â in 1945 and main line services to Wexford transferred from Harcourt Street prior to that lines closure in 1958. Introduction of the high frequency DART services in the late 1990s saw the move of mainline services from to . Services From Bradshaw's 1843 timetable:  Rolling stock  =Locomotives= The D&KR; initially ordered six locomotives, Hibernia, Britannia, and Manchester from Sharp Brothers together with Vauxhall, Dublin, and Kingstown from George Forrester and Company. The Sharps' engines employed vertical cylinders whilst the Forresters' were horizontal. Vauxhall and Hibernia were the first to arrive by ship for ¬£21 each and participated in public trials in October 1834 with Hibernia hauling the first fee paying service on 17 December 1834. The design of Hibernia and her sisters proved problematic and they were withdrawn early, Hibernia having been noted to have exploded in 1842. The D&KR; ordered a further locomotive Star from Forrester. This was followed by two 2-2-0T well tanks locomotives, Victoria and Comet, again from Forrester's. These were the first tank locomotives in public passenger service. 1841 saw the D&KR;'s Grand Canal Street railway works build the 2-2-0T well tank Princess which was the first locomotive in the world built by a railway company's own workshop. Princess was also noted for being modified to fit the profile of the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway and worked that line for the period 23 December 1848 to 5 February 1849 when the atmospheric system broke down. Grand Canal Street also produced a series of locomotives for the D&KR; after Princess, the list includes such names as Belleisle, Shamrock, Erin, Albert, Burgoyne, Cyclops, Vulcan, Jupiter and possibly Juno. Some of these were either built or re-built to the gauge that was adopted around 1856. A small number of these engines were noted as still operating in the 1870s where they looked diminutive compared to their successor 2-2-2WT Neilson locomotives introduced from 1865. =Carriages= The D&KR; initially introduced four types of four wheeled carriages. The fully enclosed purple first class carriage had 3 compartments, each with two rows of upholstered seats seating three abreast. The pale yellow covered carriages also had upholstered seats in three compartments but at four abreast for a total of 24 passengers. The green second class open class carriages were only used in summer. They had open sides and a roof and seated 28 in seven rows. Blue third class carriages were understood to have had roofs despite the depictions of contemporary illustrations. Capacity per carriage was 35 in seven rows of five abreast on boarded seats with low backrests. Typical trains consists were a single first class carriage, two to four second class and three third class. Many carriages were converted to gauge in the mid 1850s. =Preservation= One item of Dublin and Kingstown stock has survived into preservation. Open-sided second No. 38, built in 1834 of 4' 8.5\\" gauge and re-gauged to 5' 3\\" in 1857, was stored by the DW&WR;, later at Inchicore Works by the Great Southern Railways, along with third No. 48, built in 1838. They went to the 100th anniversary of the British Rainhill Trials in 1929 with Great Southern and Great Southern and Western Railway locomotive No. 36 before being returned to rot in Inchicore dump. No. 48 was restored and preserved by the Belfast Transport Museum in 1964, where it remains in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum to this day. Unfortunately, No. 38 was considered to be too badly damaged by weathering and rot to be overhauled, and was scrapped while No. 48 was restored. =Models= The Fry Collection contains a scale model replica of the first train in Ireland consisting of locomotive, tender and four carriages of different types.. The Science Museum, London possesses 1:6 model of the 1851 built D&KR; locomotive Alexandra built by T. H. Goodisson and dating from the 1850s or shortly thereafter.  Incidents  * Sunday 22 February 1835: the first passenger fatality; William Thomson was travelling on the carriage step and either jumped or was thrown off near Blackrock, striking Lord Cloncurry's railing, and was fatally injured. * Tuesday 24 February 1835: a woman gave birth in a third class carriage on the 20:00 train from Dublin to Kingstown, the first record of such an event in Ireland. * 28 March 1935: locomotive Vauxhall collided with Dublin coming out of a locomotive yard, then crashed tender-first into a wall. Repairs took about a week. * June 1840: Locomotives Star and Victoria collided; directors concluded that the Star was uneconomical to repair due to its mechanical state caused by previous derailments and wear. * 27 October 1842: the inner firebox of locomotive Hibernia collapsed; the explosion wrecked the locomotive and tender. The crew were fortunately in the waiting room at the time and so avoided being showered in red-hot coke. The engine was scrapped, and the others of her class were taken out of service until a close examination was completed and then sold to contractors in 1843 and 1846. * February 1849: Cyclops failed to stop when entering , resulting in a collision. The tank locomotives had no brakes at that time, but relied on a combination of the guard applying the brake in a third class carriage and the locomotive driver using his reversing gear. Tank locomotives subsequently had brakes fitted. * August 1853: on the Dalkey Atmospheric section, a boy leaned out to see a balloon from a third class carriage with waist-high sides and open windows. He stuck his head on a bridge and was killed.

It was established in 1958, making it one of the oldest such festivals in the United States, and has roots going back to the early 1900s. Each summer, the festival draws about 25,000 patronsInstitute of Outdoor Theatre to see the works of Shakespeare, as well as classics and contemporary plays, in the Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre and indoor University Theatre. The company is made up of professional actors, directors, designers and artisans from around the United States and the world, along with student interns from around the nation. Timothy Orr, the current producing artistic director, was hired in 2014 after serving as an actor in the company since 2007 and associate producing artistic director since 2011.coloradoshakes.org In early April 2020, with the uncertainty of the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, CSF cancelled the summer 2020 season altogether.  History  = 1870s-1944 = The festival has roots in the earliest days of the University of Colorado at Boulder, when senior classes performed commencement plays under a grove of cottonwood trees planted in the 1870s on the east lawn of the first building on campus, Old Main. When electric lights became available in 1901, the university began to stage evening performances. The tradition was interrupted by World War I and resumed in 1919 by George F. Reynolds, an Elizabethan theater scholar and professor of English Literature. In 1936, Reynolds helped develop plans to build the Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre. Rippon (1850-1935) was the first female professor at the university and the first woman in the United States to teach at a state university. She was chair of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literature and also served, without financial compensation, as Dean of Women.\\"Separate Lives: The Story of Mary Rippon\\" by Sylvia Pettem Mary Rippon, 1899. CU Heritage Center. After her death, University President George Norlin suggested that a planned outdoor theater be named in Rippon's honor. Construction began in 1936 with funding from the Board of Regents and the federal Works Progress Administration, as well as private donations. ‚ÄúAlumni Day‚Äù celebrations were held in the still-incomplete theater on June 13, 1936. The Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre was officially completed in 1939, but no plays were staged there until 1944, when book reviewer, Shakespeare scholar and associate director of libraries in charge of acquisitions James Sandoe was asked to direct a play. Because the University Theatre was occupied by the Department of the Navy due to the war effort, Sandoe, also influential in developing the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, decided to stage Romeo and Juliet in the outdoor theater. The event was so popular that it was followed by The Merchant of Venice in 1945 and Henry IV, Part I in 1946.James S. Sandoe Papers; L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University Sandoe directed nine seasons for CSF between 1961 and 1973. No director helmed more productions until Department of Theatre and Dance professor James Symons pushed the mark to 11 in recent years. However, no one to date‚Äî70 years later‚Äîhas directed more productions of Shakespeare's plays on the Mary Rippon stage. All four of Sandoe's children appeared in the CSF. Son Sam Sandoe and daughter Anne Sandoe continue to act in the festival each summer.Colorado Shakespeare Festival 2014 program = 1940s to 1960s = James Sandoe and Jack Crouch, professor in the Department of English and Speech and head of CU's Creative Arts Festival, began to discuss the possibility of creating an annual Shakespeare festival on campus. Crouch took over in 1947, after which Shakespeare plays were performed in the Rippon theater every year except for 1957, when the annual production was staged in the indoor University Theater. Crouch directed seven plays over the next 10 years and founded the Colorado Shakespeare Festival, which premiered on Aug. 2, 1958, and featured three productions: Julius Caesar, Hamlet, and The Taming of the Shrew. More than 7,000 patrons attended 13 performances that year, paying $1.50 per ticket. The following year, more than 13,000 people attended. Julius Caesar, 1958 By the end of its first decade, CSF had produced 26 of the 37 plays in the canon, with only one duplication, Hamlet in 1965. Howard M. Banks‚Äô production of Henry V was filmed for television in 1961. Crouch stepped down as executive director after the 1963 season but remained active in the festival through the 1980s. CSF directors since 1963 have been Albert Nadeau (1964‚Äì66), Richard Knaub (1967-1976), Martin Cobin (1982‚Äì85), Daniel S.P. Yang (1978-1981; 1986‚Äì89), Dick Devin (1990‚Äì94; 1997-2004), Jim Symons (1995), Philip Sneed (2007-2012; now executive director at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities) and Timothy Orr (2013‚Äìpresent).Office of University Communications, University of Colorado Boulder Prominent CSF alumni include Michael Moriarty (1962; ‚ÄúLaw and Order,‚Äù ‚ÄúPale Rider‚Äù), Barry Corbin (1962; ‚ÄúLonesome Dove,‚Äù ‚ÄúNorthern Exposure‚Äù), Karen Grassle (1964; ‚ÄúLittle House on the Prairie‚Äù), Barry Kraft (1966; Oregon Shakespeare Festival), Joe Spano (1968; ‚ÄúNCIS,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Graffiti,‚Äù ‚ÄúHill Street Blues‚Äù), Annette Bening (1980; ‚ÄúAmerican Beauty,‚Äù ‚ÄúDangerous Liaisons‚Äù), Jimmy Smits (1984; ‚ÄúNYPD Blue,‚Äù ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù episodes II and III), Val Kilmer (1988; ‚ÄúTop Gun,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Doors‚Äù),coloradoshakes.org = 1970s = Cymbeline, 1975 The Rippon theater was used through 1966 as originally built ‚Äî a three-level stage facing an open amphitheater with sandstone benches seating for about 2,000 patrons. In 1967, the university funded construction of stone walkways and forestage, and constructed two large light towers in 1968. Through the years, the Rippon theater has been continually altered and improved. In 1981 Yang hired Richard Devin to make the Rippon space more theatrical and to create more lighting areas on the stage. In 1975, with a production of Cymbeline, CSF became one of seven companies in the world and just the second American university, after the University of Michigan, to perform Shakespeare's complete canon. That year the festival also produced a staged reading of Two Noble Kinsmen, attributed to Shakespeare and John Fletcher, and Ben Jonson's Volpone, the festival's only non-Shakespeare production until 1991. In 1978, CSF inaugurated its Young People's Shakespeare program, which performed an abbreviated versions of Twelfth Night around the Boulder community. The program morphed into a program offering internships to high school students. In 1982, CSF began its Dramaturg Program, recruiting CU doctoral students to research productions. In 1976 the festival launched CSF Annual (later renamed On-Stage Studies) a scholarly journal, under the editorship of Cobin. = 1980s = Under Yang, the festival began hiring professional designers, technicians and directors with national reputations, including Robert Benedetti, Audrey Stanley and Tom Markus. Yang also hired graduate students from around the country, moving beyond the confines of CU- Boulder, and in 1982 hired the first Equity actor under a ‚Äúguest artist contract.‚Äù With such changes, CSF's reputation began to grow. Shakespeare Quarterly remarked that the festival ‚Äúhad stepped out of its academic cocoon‚Äù in its Summer 1980 issue and in 1989 praised its experimentation, from ‚ÄúHamlet in outer space, to topless witches in Macbeth, to a commedia dell‚Äôarte Shrew.‚Äù In 1992, CSF was named as one of the top Shakespeare festivals in the nation by Time magazine. That same year, the Festival received the Colorado Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts and the Denver Drama Critic's Circle Award for ‚ÄúBest Season for a Theatre Company.‚Äù = 1990s = Dick Devin, who started working at the CSF as a lighting designer in 1981, and done design work in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Cairo, was selected as the festival's producing artistic director nine years later. Under Devin in the 1990s and 2000s, CSF bumped the number of annual summer productions from three to four, with occasional forays into non-Shakespeare other classical or related material, such as Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead in 1995 and Moli√®re's The Miser in 1996. Among Devin's innovations was a program that offered free tickets to productions by other companies with the purchase of a season subscription. In 2003, for instance, those who bought CSF subscriptions also received tickets to productions at the Denver Center, Nomad Theatre, Denver's Curious Theatre, the Colorado Music Festival and the University of Colorado Concerts series. In 2010, Devin was named an Honorary Lifetime Member Award by the U.S. Institute for Theatre Technology Inc., of which he had served as president.CU Connections The festival began to experience budget shortfalls, which were periodically covered by the College of Arts and Sciences. Devin cited funding challenges as one reason he decided to step down: \\"After 17 years of trying to find a half million dollars a year, it gets to be a struggle to get up and make it happen every year. That's the principal reason,\\" he told the Daily Camera newspaper. = 2000s and 2010s = To Kill a Mockingbird, 2009 With the arrival of Philip Sneed in 2006,\\"Philip Sneed: A bard comes home,\\" Denver Post CSF began producing six plays each year, including non-Shakespeare works such as Woody Guthrie‚Äôs American Song (2008) and To Kill a Mockingbird (2009). To Kill a Mockingbird was widely praised by critics and earned a prestigious Ovation Award from the Denver Post for its director, Jane Page.Denver Post Sneed was a CU-Boulder graduate and former CSF actor who came to the festival after serving as director of the Foothill Theatre Company in Nevada City, California.coloradoshakes.org Sneed was seen as willing to experiment. He brought in Tina Packer, founder of Shakespeare and Co. in Massachusetts, to present her five-part work, Women of Will, performed by Pack and Nigel Gore in 2011, and special performances of a condensed version in 2012. He also launched a plan to perform Shakespeare's Henriad histories ‚Äî Richard II, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V, over three seasons, 2013‚Äì15.\\"Phil Sneed leaving Colorado Shakes for Arvada Center\\" by John Moore, culturewest.org The festival also produced holiday shows from 2007 to 2011, including A Child‚Äôs Christmas in Wales (2007‚Äì08), A Christmas Carol (2009-10) and It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life (2011).Colorado Shakespeare Festival, coloradoshakes.org He also established a ‚Äúcultural exchange‚Äù with the Maxim Gorky Theatre in Vladivostok, Russia. In 2011, CSF hosted Gorky director Efim Zyenyatsky and Russian actors for a bi-lingual production of The Inspector General.

The Green Shows start about 90 minutes before the plays begin and last about 45 minutes. The Boulder Renaissance Consort has appeared frequently since the early 1980s.

July 19, 1979, in Southern Illinois) is an American comic book artist best known for his work with the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series, originally published by Archie Comics.  Career  = Sonic the Hedgehog comics = Yardley has been greatly interested in comics for most of his life, as well as the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series. He grew up reading the earliest issues of Archie Comics' officially licensed Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. He professionally spells his name with an \\"!\\" at the end as a tribute to Scott Shaw, who also spelled his name the same way. Scott Shaw was one of the first artists whom worked on Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog series. Yardley worked mainly as a penciller on Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog series from 2005 until Sega of America's termination of Archie Comics' license in 2017. Yardley also occasionally worked on the spin-off comic Sonic X, and served as the main artist for the side-series Sonic Universe. After IDW Publishing picked up the Sonic the Hedgehog license, the company confirmed Yardley as one of the pencillers for their own Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, which starts circulation in April 2018. He and Ian Flynn collaborated closely on the Sonic the Hedgehog series during the Archie Comics years, sometimes himself writing script for the series. He has even inked and occasionally colored a few issues. The collaboration will continue for IDW Publishing's series. = Other works = Although Sega canceled their Sonic the Hedgehog comic series, Archie Comics brought back Yardley, alongside colleagues Ian Flynn and Matt Herms, to revive their Cosmo the Merry Martian intellectual property. The first issue of Cosmo the Mighty Martian was released in January 2018. Yardley worked as the main penciler/inker of an original manga-like series known as Riding Shotgun, published by Tokyopop. Riding Shotgun ended after two volumes, though Yardley still had ideas for a third volume. One of Yardley's first known, original comics was a series known as Nate and Steve, on which he worked with three of his friends.  Personal life  Yardley was born in Southern Illinois. Yardley is a 2001 graduate from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and he currently lives with his wife and five children in Rincon, Georgia.

He was born in Savigny-sur-Orge near Paris, but spent his childhood in Rodez. Career A brilliant amateur rider who won the 1997 Coupe de France Amateurs with his team of Montauban, he began cycling as professional on 1 September 1997 in the Belgian team . Three seasons of training followed from there, during which he took part in many major races, such as the Tour of Flanders, Giro d'Italia and the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©. His results during these years were rather modest: a fifth place in the Grand Prix du Midi Libre's stage and a fourteenth place in the Grand Prix de Wallonie. At the end of his contract at the end of the 2000 season, Laurent Jalabert held one hand to Olivier by helping him to join the new Danish team , which was his best season. He took part in a high number of races from the Tour Down Under in Australia in January to Paris‚ÄìTours in October. On 18 May 2001, in the first stage of the Tour de Picardie, Asmaker was in a breakaway with several other well known riders, such as David Millar, Sylvain Chavanel, Robbie McEwen, Baden Cooke or Inigo Landaluze. Asmaker attacked in the last kilometre and won the stage. He took the leader's jersey and kept it until the end of the race, in spite of the unceasing attacks of David Millar. CSC-Tiscali obtained an invitation for the Tour de France thanks to his performance partly. But in a short descent of stage 1 of the Grand Prix du Midi Libre, he fell and broke his collarbone, so was unable to start the race. In 2002, he raced a lot with his friend Laurent Jalabert. On April, he finished third in the Tour de Picardie. He was not selected to ride the Tour de France, after being replaced. He raced his last race as professional was in the 2002 Paris‚ÄìTours, where he was part of a 150 kilometer breakaway with his team mate Jakob Piil, who won the race ahead of Jacky Durand. At the end of the season, his contract wasn't renewed. He sought out another team, but was unable to find one. In 2003, he returned in the amateurs with the US Montauban team. On his first race, he won the GP de Montastruc ahead of the best riders of the Pyrenees region. The following year, he won the GP of Vougy solo and the first stage of the Tour des Deux-S√®vres. At the end of the 2005 season, he ended his career to devote himself to his future job as a policeman near Toulouse.

An excursion train from Margate to Kentish Town derailed on a sharp curve at Eltham Well Hall station, Eltham, London. The curve had a Maximum permitted speed to be taken at but the train was estimated to have been travelling at resulting in the locomotive and all but one of the ten carriages derailing. The driver Robert Wilsdon and five passengers were killed, and 126 people were injured. At the subsequent public inquiry it was revealed that Wilsdon had been intoxicated by alcohol.  Robert Wilsdon  The driver of the Excursion train was Robert Wilsdon, a Driver for British Rail's Southern Region based at Hither Green TMD since December 1961. He had been working on the railways since the very end of 1958 and was experienced to drive the British Rail Class 47 locomotive, which would occasionally come down from trains in other regions. Despite his experience and long time working on the railways, Wilsdon was not a stellar employee had been reprimanded five times throughout his career. Of these penalties, three were fairly minor isolated offences (unauthorized absence in October 1960, persistent lateness in February 1961 and a \\"relatively minor driving offence\\" in February 1963) but two were serious offences, one of which resulted in a temporary suspension. The first occurred on November 7th 1961 where Wilsdon had been charged ¬£150 for being Drunk and disorderly, causing damage to a shop window and assaulting a Police constable whilst off-duty. Although Wilsdon paid the fine, British Rail were not notified of this occurrence until a colleague of Wilsdon's was similarly charged five days later and both men were subsequently suspended shortly afterwards, to which Wilsdon immediately appealed, claiming that the event was an isolated incident he was thoroughly ashamed of and that he had been celebrating a promotion to Passed Fireman with his colleague who greatly assisted him, later claiming to a representative from the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen that he would not drink again. ASLEF sided with Wilsdon and General Secretary William Evans sided with Wilsdon. Both Wilsdon and his colleague were reinstated on December 18th 1961, with Wilsdon being promoted to a driver less than a week later on December 25th with his transfer to Hither Green. His colleague was similarly promoted but resigned in early 1963 after a series of reprimands and suspensions. The public inquiry into the accident eleven years later agreed that this incident was a seemingly isolated occurrence and all had reason to believe Wilsdon; the Line Manager who reinstated the two was not criticized for this approach, although some criticism was given to the Management in 1961 for promoting Wilsdon so quickly after being reinstated. The second incident occurred on March 28th 1969 when Wilsdon was fined ¬£1 for being drunk in Lewisham, similarly off-duty at the time, at which point again the railways were not informed of this occurrence until April, although he was not suspended at all for this incident owing to the fact that his superior at Hither Green was busy and then went on leave and as such was not able to speak with Wilsdon until June (at which point he gave Wilsdon a stern reprimand and advised him that such behavior was not acceptable). The actions of the superior for this incident were criticized as \\"unwise\\" but was not considered a serious failing: his eventual response to Wilsdon was appropriate and all that could have been done. Since 1969, Wilsdon had a clean record with no reprimands. By 1972 he was married with young children and living in Rainham, Kent - which meant he would usually have to make an almost two hour rail commute to his depot at Hither Green. This travel time and distance between Rainham and Hither Green played a key role in the accident that occurred. Events =Margate Excursions= On Sunday June 11 1972, a day-trip to Margate had been arranged for the employees (and their families) of British Rail's Midland Region based at the North London depot at Kentish Town. Owing to the large number of day-trippers booked for this customary annual works- outing, a pair of excursion trains were laid on to transport them to Margate and back. These trains would be driven by Southern Region drivers for some of the journey (particularly to ensure that experienced drivers took the trains through the complex arrangements around Clapham Junction) and would, on reaching Margate and being cleared of passengers, be take onward to Ramsgate Depot where they would be stored until the return trip. The outbound journeys left Kentish Town around 0830, were completed uneventfully and the trains stabled at Ramsgate as planned. The second excursion train, scheduled to leave Margate at 20:05 was to be crewed by Driver Wilsdon, Secondman P.E. Stokes and Guard H. Atterbury. Stokes was 18 years old and had been working on the railways for almost two years at the time of the accident, having been based at Hither Green this entire time. He had worked with Wilsdon occasionally before and had driven with him a few times prior. Guard Atterbury was 57 and had been a guard since 1948 and was based at London Bridge and although he had worked the Bexleyheath line before, he had never done so on a fast train. He had worked with Wilsdon a few times before and considered him an experienced driver. Wilsdon and Stokes were to sign on duty at Hither Green in person by 15:42 to catch a train as passengers to Ramsgate, transferring at Dartford. The 20:05 return excursion train crewed by Wilsdon, Stokes and Atterbury consisted of a British Rail Class 47 locomotive, No.1630 from the Midland Region, and ten coaches; a Brake Second Corridor, a Second Corridor, a Composite Corridor, three more Second corridor's, another Composite, a Tourist Standard Open, another Second Corridor and another Brake Second Corridor at the rear. All of the coaches were Mark 1 rolling stock with the oldest coach dating back to 1954 and the newest coach dating to 1962. =Events prior to Wilsdon arriving at Ramsgate= As he did not need to be on duty until the afternoon, Wilsdon joined his two brothers for lunch at around 12:55, the three travelling to a local pub where they stayed until closing time just after 14:00. Here, Wilsdon drank two pints of Light and bitter and a half pint of Light ale which was confirmed by his brothers who'd drank similarly. According to them, the three returned home and spent the afternoon indoors with the children until Robert was driven by one of his brothers to Rainham station at around 17:15. Both brothers confirmed that he had not drunk after leaving the pub and were adamant on this point at the later public inquiry. However, this evidence was seemingly contradicted by a later statement made by Secondman Stokes when they met at Ramsgate, in which Wilsdon told Stokes that he had \\"ended up going somewhere and drinking some Sherry\\". At 15:22, Wilsdon signed on duty with Hither Green by telephone claiming that he was going to head directly to Ramsgate from Rainham and noted that he had to catch an earlier train from Rainham (the 15:32 instead of the 15:42, which was not running on Sundays) and therefore asked Hither Green if he could be considered on-duty from 15:12. This was agreed as there was no evidence to the contrary and it was believed that Wilsdon was traveling to Ramsgate at this time. In reality, Wilsdon did not leave for Rainham station until 17:15 and as such his move was solely to try and gain extra pay for two hours that he was not actually on duty. It also meant that his Supervisors at Hither Green would not see him in person. By contrast to this, secondman Stokes arrived at Hither Green, signed on duty in person at around 15:12 and was instructed by the Supervisor to travel on the 15:32 train and try to meet Wilsdon on the train. This did not occur, and the two met up at Ramsgate Depot by the locomotive at around 18:25. Stokes had arrived first having spoken with the Supervisor at Ramsgate for the identity of the train. Wilsdon did not meet with the Supervisor at Ramsgate likely owing to the fact that his was the only Class 47 engine at the depot and would have been easy to find. =Leaving for Margate= When Stokes boarded the engine, he waited alone in the cab until around 18:25 when Wilsdon arrived and spoke about the preparations for the journey back to London. Stokes recalled that when Wilsdon turned to speak with him, he \\"smelt something pretty strong\\" on the driver's breath and when asked, Wilsdon explained that he had been drinking at lunchtime and later had some sherry prior to arriving in Ramsgate. This evidence contradicts that of Wilsdon's brothers who claimed that he had not drunk between 14:02 and 17:15. Despite this, Wilsdon suggested the pair go to the nearby Railway Staff Association Club at about 19:00 and get a drink to which Stokes agreed, with the pair arriving just in time for the club to open at 19:05.The pair had three pints of light and bitter each with Wilsdon possibly drinking another half pint of light ale, according to the evidence of club staff who served him. Stokes was uncertain on this point but agreed that \\"Bob could have gotten one in\\". Running slightly late and at Wilsdon's urging, the pair returned to Ramsgate Depot at around 19:40. Guard Atterbury, who arrived at Ramsgate some hours earlier and had been relaxing in the staff break room of the station, had gone to prepare the train for its departure at around 19:30 and initially noted that the engine crew were absent. Before he could go ask superiors as to where they were, he saw Stokes and Wilsdon return. He briefed the pair on the train's particulars with Wilsdon appearing sober and routine. The empty train left Ramsgate and made an uneventful journey to Margate, arriving at around 19:59. =Margate= The train arrived at Margate and the entrainment of passengers was routine, with boarding complete by 20:04. Stationmaster Arundell signaled the train clear to depart for London, but both he and Atterbury found that there was no response in the cab. When Arundell went to examine the cab, he found it empty but after returning shortly afterwards, saw a pair of beer bottles in the cab. Arundell believed that they were a gift left by the organizers of the excursion to the engine crew - such being a normal 'tip' for excursion drivers to enjoy off-duty - and he did not question their appearance. Shortly thereafter, Wilsdon and Stokes returned and entered the cab preparing for departure, with neither seeming unusual: when Arundell told them to hurry up, Wilsdon calmly noted they could regain lost time on the journey. A member of staff on the platform at this time noted that he had seen both Stokes and Wilsdon depart the locomotive and leave the station via Platform No.1 three minutes after having arrived at Margate and this was later compared with the timings made by Guard Atterbury, who recorded a 20:13 departure from Margate (eight minutes late) noting that both Stokes and Wilsdon were absent. Exactly where the pair went in this period is unknown owing to Wilsdon's death and Stokes having little recollection of the events after leaving Ramsgate and although another pub was close to the station, it was considered that neither had time to reach it. =The Journey= Having left Margate eight minutes late and scheduled to run non-stop (aside from a later stop to change crew), Wilsdon was able to run the train at high speed and according to Atterbury's timings, was only a minute late after passing Faversham ( from Margate). However, as the train approached Sittingbourne, the train was forced to briefly stop due to signals and it was held again momentarily around Rainham by Signalman Obee who had been forced to open his level crossing to allow a pair of buses through as the train was running late. After the crossing was cleared, he set the route for the train to proceed but instead, the train came to a stop at the platform. Railman Fleming, who was on duty at the platform and knew Wilsdon well, saw the train arrive and asked Wilsdon if it had broken down (owing to the clear signal visible from the platform), to which Wilsdon merely said \\"No\\" and jumped down from his cab before walking to a telephone on the platform to speak with Obee. He used the correct telephone and spoke quite clearly and was not at all slurred according to both Fleming and Obee. According to Obee, Wilsdon had stopped at Rainham to inquire of the position of the first excursion train, which Obee explained was to stop at Gillingham railway station and would let Wilsdon overtake it, which was not as planned (Wilsdon's train was to overtake the first excursion train at Newington railway station which was prior to Rainham); to which Wilsdon told him \\"you should read your weekly notices\\". Although uncertain, it seems that Wilsdon believed that the two stoppages that occurred to his train at Sittingbourne and Rainham and having not seen the first excursion train at Newington, was because the first train was running slowly and kept stopping his train. He later commented to Stokes a joking complaint about the first excursion train, calling it a \\"slow bastard\\". Upon completing his phone conversation, Wilsdon returned to his cab and departed having been stopped at Rainham for about four minutes. A combination of the signal checks at Sittingbourne and Rainham and the unscheduled stop at Rainham had caused Wilson to lose most of the progress he had made between Margate and Sittingbourne. Shortly after leaving Rainham, Atterbury noted that the speed seemed \\"a little bit excessive\\" and that Wilsdon had been braking intensely between Gillingham and Chatham railway station. The last station the train passed on its journey that Atterbury had to time was at Bexleyheath railway station east of the accident site. According to his notes, the train passed through Bexleyheath at 21:31, seven minutes behind schedule (estimates showed that Wilsdon had made up at least a minute and a half between Gillingham and Strood) and was running on clear signals. =The Crash= Although Atterbury had been somewhat concerned about excessive speed between Gillingham and Chatham, he stated that Wilsdon had operated appropriately through Dartford. However when approaching Eltham Park railway station he became concerned at the train's apparent speed and more so as it neared Eltham Well Hall, where a sharp curve changed the train's direction from southwest to northwest. Trying to gain Wilsdon's attention, he made two light applications (\\"splashes\\") of the guard's brake. It seems these splashes were too late and light to register in the cab. By the time the train approached Eltham Well Hall station it was running at around . Railman Akehurst, who was on duty on the Well Hall platforms, had seen several earlier trains pass through the station and thence the curve, all of them slowing to the safe speed of but when he saw the excursion train approaching, he was quite certain it was traveling far beyond that speed. He immediately tried to signal to the driver to stop but was unable to gain Wilsdon's attention. The train passed through at high speed without braking and sped into the curve at around . At no point did Wilsdon even attempt to slow his train beyond having already shut off the engine to coast which was normal at this long downhill sector of the line. In the cab, Stokes later recalled that Wilsdon had suddenly shouted in a frightened way at the sight of the curve approaching, to which Stokes immediately braced himself in the seconds that he had available. The locomotive jumped the sharp curve, derailing and rolling onto its left side and sliding through a coal yard. The front of the cab was torn open and debris thrown and 'ploughed' inside, killing Wilsdon and severely injuring Stokes. The first coach followed the overturned locomotive but remained upright, the coupling failing quite late into the sequence. It came to a stand laying parallel with the locomotive, having jack-knifed and pushed it slightly around so the leading cab was facing back towards the line and the rear cab was pointing away from the track with the rear end of the first coach up against the leading cab. The second and third coach followed the first coach until relatively late into the derailment, with the coupling between the first and second failing around the end of the derailment causing both coaches to overturn onto their right side with the leading end of the second coach coming to a stand in front of the locomotive and the rear of the first coach, which in combination with the fourth coach, formed a \\"N\\" shape out of the first four coaches. Both were severely damaged. The Fourth coach had ended up roughly 90 degrees to the track leaning over on its left side, the rear of the coach had been somewhat damaged by the fifth, sixth and seventh coaches passing by it, derailed but still on the track, all three of these coaches were leaning over on their left sides to lessening degrees, with the leading end of the fifth coach having been badly damaged by the impact with the fourth coach. The eighth coach was upright but derailed, the ninth coach was derailed at its leading bogie but also upright and the tenth coach that Atterbury was riding in was upright and on the rails, though some internal damage had occurred. The derailed train came to a halt very close to an electrical sub-station powering the third-rail for Electric multiple unit trains and this had immediately short-circuited. Railman Akehurst, who had heard the derailment, immediately called Dartford signal Box and reported the derailment. Emergency services were notified, and arrived between 21:40 and 21:42. As well as Wilsdon, two passengers died at the scene; a woman later died of her injuries in August and a male likewise in November, bringing the number of fatalities to five. 125 passengers were injured. Aftermath A Public inquiry carried out into the cause of the accident was launched on June 12 1972 by Colonel John R.H. Robertson that looked into the cause of the derailment. The Report for the crash was released on June 1st 1973 and it quite clearly showed that the accident was caused entirely by the actions of Robert Wilsdon, in that he had \\"grossly impaired his ability to drive safely by drinking a considerable quantity of alcohol both before and after booking on duty\\". He was thoroughly criticizing of Wilsdon's behaviour, describing it as \\"reprehensible\\" and \\"disgraceful\\". His suspension in 1961 was considered a warning sign of Wilsdon's alcoholic tendencies but it was agreed that at the time there was no evidence to disprove Wilsdon's statements that he would better himself and not drink again. The 1969 incident also showed Wilsdon's disregard of what had occurred in 1961 but it was agreed that the Manager at the time had been unwise in waiting two months to question Wilsdon, but had acted appropriately when he did. British Rail staff who came in contact with Wilsdon on June 11 (His Supervisor at Hither Green, Depot staff at Ramsgate, Secondman Stokes, Railway Club staff at Ramsgate, Guard Atterbury, Stationmaster Arundell and his staff at Margate, Railman Fleming and Signalman Obee at Rainham) were all intensively questioned and gave evidence at the inquiry regarding the state of Wilsdon, to which all agreed that Wilsdon appeared perfectly fit and sober even as late as his unscheduled stop in Rainham, with the only person aware of Wilsdon already having drunk alcohol prior to reaching Ramsgate being Secondman Stokes, who considered him still fit and sober enough to drive the train. None of the staff were criticized for failing to stop Wilsdon from his duties under the belief he was too drunk and evidence by Wilsdon's Father-in- law, Brothers and friends confirmed that although Wilsdon did drink heavily, he could \\"carry\\" his alcohol well and that the amount of alcohol he drunk was not enough to make his drunkenness visible, although the report believed that Wilsdon's actions at Rainham and his reactions at Eltham Well Hall clearly showed that he was beginning to suffer effects of drunkenness. Secondman Stokes, who agreed with Wilsdon to get some extra drinks at Ramsgate was severely criticized for his \\"disgraceful\\" behaviour in drinking three pints prior to taking the train back to Margate, but it was agreed that Stokes' young age and weak character meant that he seemed unwilling to stop Wilsdon from going to get some drink. Guard Atterbury was not criticized whatsoever for his behaviour and it was considered unfortunate that his \\"splashes\\" were too weak to gain Wilsdon's attention. From the evidence gained of Wilsdon's activities on June 11, a fairly thorough timeline of Wilsdon's movements were tracked and confirmed by those who he made contact with but three moments of uncertainty were later found in Wilsdon's movements that day. The first and most serious of these moments was the fact that it was uncertain what had occurred with Wilsdon and his Brother's between 14:02 and 17:15 with his Brothers both declaring that Wilsdon had not drunk after returning from the pub in Rainham. In contrast, Stokes claimed that Wilsdon mentioned drinking some sherry when they met at Ramsgate. Although Robertson could not confirm Stokes' statements, he considered it likely that Wilsdon had drunk after 14:02 owing to the smell on Wilsdon's breath at Rainham several hours later and whilst not explicitly accusing Wilsdon's brothers of lying, considered it that anybody who tried to hide evidence of Wilsdon's drinking that day \\"did him a disservice\\". The second uncertain moment was what occurred to both him and Stokes during the stop at Margate, in which both seemingly left the station via the Platform No.1 entrance. Stokes was unable to recall much of what occurred at Margate and Wilsdon died, so it was uncertain as to what had occurred during this period, and although a pub was close to the station, it was considered that they did not have enough time to reach it. The final uncertainty was the fact that when his body was Autopsied, Wilsdon's blood alcohol content was 0.278% (the legal limit for driving a road vehicle in England at that time was 0.08%). There was an imbalance with the urine alcohol level which made it very likely that the driver had also been drinking alcohol within an hour of his death, meaning it was possible he had been drinking at the controls. Investigating this theory, the morning after the accident, the cab was searched and three smashed glasses were found in the cab's wreckage. Two of them were the beer bottles that Stationmaster Arundell had seen at Margate and both were confirmed to have been unopened. A third smashed bottle found was later proven to have been a medicine bottle and was unlikely to have carried any alcohol at the time of the accident. The only other theory was that Wilsdon had obtained a bottle of spirits at some point, stored it on his person and had drunk it at some point after leaving Margate, and later disposed of the glass by throwing it out the window of the Locomotive, with the theory being that Wilsdon either obtained the bottle at some point whilst in Margate or had kept one on his person since he left Rainham for work. Despite this, Robertson felt that there was no severe issue with drinking amongst drivers on Britain's railways, with only two other accidents (one in 1913 and another in 1952) having occurred explicitly due to driver drunkenness in the sixty years prior to the accident, and as such he believed that it was a combination of railway staff's thoughts and self-discipline for drivers' behaviour with alcohol. The last recommendation that Robertson made regarding the accident was the usage of telephone to sign on duty within the Southern Region. Whilst it was agreed that it was a fairly common occurrence in the Southern Region and British Rail had adopted a policy where certain drivers could be granted need to book on via Telephone (Typically those either living far from depots or those whose duties commenced far from their depots). This procedure was considered practical and was allowed to remain in use, but it was agreed that the method Wilsdon used (Where he casually booked on duty and for his own benefit of gaining two additional hours' pay by booking on at 15:22 instead of around 17:00 when he actually did leave home for work) was not appropriate and was to be stopped or prevented wherever possible. This issue was however was brought up again in 1991 after the Cannon Street station rail crash in which the driver in that instance was believed to have been high on Cannabis and caused a buffer-stop collision. Although it was agreed that the signalling played no part in the collision, it was later agreed that the signals around Eltham Well Hall would be redesigned to slow a train to round the curve rather than remain at green, which would mean it would be less likely a Driver would be caught by surprise with the curve.

Munali was the first secondary school for black students in Zambia's history. Some of its alumni are notable Zambian politicians and public figures:  History  =Colonial times= In colonial times, Munali was intended as Northern Rhodesia's principal school for talented native Zambians. The school was first established in 1938 as Entral Trade School. Founded in its own right in 1947 as \\"Munali secondary School\\" with about 40 pupils, it was originally situated at the David Kaunda campus at \\"Old Munali\\". In 1953 the school moved from Old Munali to its current campus at \\"New Munali\\". After independence in 1964, the new Government Cabinet was composed almost entirely of alumni of Munali Secondary School. Notable amongst this cohort were Kenneth Kaunda, and brothers Sikota and Arthur Wina (dcd), the latter having been the husband of Zambia's current Vice-President, Inonge Wina. Other famous alumni include former mayors of Lusaka and several businessmen. Although all the students were black Zambians, the teachers in the early days were European. Early members of the original teaching staff included: W.C.Little, P.K.Stevenson, Bill Shakspere and H.T. Lyons. (There was no apartheid as such in Northern Rhodesia, but until 1964 education was racially segregated, with separate schools for whites, blacks, \\"Indians\\" and \\"Cape Coloureds\\"). =Modern times= The current head teacher is Lloys Yamboto and Abraham Mwanza is the Deputy. The school's pass rate now one of highest in country: 88% in 2006. All standard school subjects are taught. Munali Secondary School now has three branches: Munali Boys Secondary School, Munali Girls Secondary School and Munali School for the Deaf and Blind. The school's slogan is \\"Only the best is good enough for Munali.\\" The school produced the entire 1964 Independence Cabinet of the first Republican President of Zambia, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, who himself is a former ‚ÄúMunalian‚Äù. The former President Mr. Rupiah Banda is also a former ‚ÄúMunalian‚Äù. One unofficial slogan is \\"Once a Munalian, always a Munalian\\". Classes are called M, U, N, A, L, I, S, E, C from Grade 8 to Grade 9 and M, U, N, A, L from grades 10 to 12. This nomenclature is derived from the name of the school: Munali Secondary School. 12M was known as the Kim Jong Il Class, named after the first President of the North Korea. The class had temporarily received financial support from the North Korean Embassy. The University of Zambia receives many students from Munali School. The school was a secondary school until 2001 when it became a high school. It only recently became a secondary school again after the education system was reorganised by the late President Michael Sata. Munali Boys Secondary School The current headmaster is Mr Nkoma, who took over from Mr.Phiri who also took over from Mrs. Pwele 2018, Mr. L. K. Yamboto in 2014. Mr. Chinkata took over from Mr. Saka, who was acting head for about three years. All classes offer three mandatory subjects (Mathematics, English and Biology) and three optional subjects.

Biography Tenney Frank earned his A.B. at the University of Kansas in 1898 and A.M. the following year. Frank went on to receive his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1903. Frank taught at Bryn Mawr College as Professor of Latin from 1904 until 1919, when he moved to the Johns Hopkins University. At Bryn Mawr Frank wrote and published his influential study Roman Imperialism in 1914. Frank believed that Rome's imperialism stemmed from a desire to keep peace in the Mediterranean world by preventing the rise of any rival power.Hammond, Mason (1948). \\"Ancient Imperialism: Contemporary Justifications,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 58, pp. 105‚Äì16. Frank's other work focused on classical literature, with articles on Cicero, Strabo, Curiatius Maternus, Plautus, and Virgil, among others. He wrote periodically for the American Historical Review, including a paper on the demise of the various ancient Italian peoples that comprised the Roman ethnicity in Julius Caesar's day. Arguing that Roman expansion brought in masses of foreign peoples and slaves that over time changed the ethnic make-up of the Roman populace and contributed to the empire's ruin.Frank. Tenney (1916). \\"Race Mixture in the Roman Empire,\\" The American Historical Review, Vol. XXI, No. 4. He worked on Latin inscriptions, including the stele from the Forum Romanum in Rome,\\"On the Stele of the Forum\\", Classical Philology, Vol. XIV, No.1 (Jan., 1919), pp. 87‚Äë88. and on Roman construction and the Servian Wall of Rome\\"Notes on the Servian Wall\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. XXII, No.2 (Apr., 1918), pp. 175‚Äë188. and.\\"The Letters on the Blocks of the Servian Wall\\", The American Journal of Philology, Vol. XLV, No.1, (1924), pp. 68‚Äë69. His work on the Roman economy was a seminal study of the economy and trade in the Roman world. He married Grace Edith Mayer in 1907. Of Swedish ancestry, Frank was influenced by his agrarian roots. He was also multilingual and had a great facility for languages, including Scandinavian tongues. At Johns Hopkins, Frank trained Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton, with whom he collaborated on his studies of the Roman economy.

He was a very productive luthier, known for making over 5000 violins and 100 violas with his staff at his workshop.Fairfield, John H. (1942) Known Violin Makers He also created 30 unique, high-end archtop guitars, one of which, the Wilkanowski Airway W-4, was famously owned by Johnny Cash since the 1980s, when it also was featured as the centerfold in the Guitar World magazine. Wilkanowski Airway W-4 owned by Cash, listed as auction item Wilkanowski was also known to be a family man, doting on his wife Amelia (1886 ‚Äì May 6, 1952),New York, Death Index, 1852‚Äì1956 for Amelia Wilkanowski, 1954 with whom he had raised 9 surviving children. When Amelia got sick, in 1950 he moved his workshop to their Long Island home to be close to her and look after her. After she died of the illness in 1952, he became very depressed and despondent without her. William stopped making instruments altogether and lost his source of income, which negatively affected his finances, adding to his depressive state.William Wilkanowski biography article by Ira Kraemer in the Cozio Archive In early December 1954, he finally committed suicide and was laid to rest next to Amelia Grave of Amelia Wilkanowski on December 13, 1954. Early life Wilkanowski was born on November 15, 1886 as listed on his grave and on his draft card, and the year 1886 indicated as estimated in several census records of New York. His obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia≈Çy≈Ñ, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. According to Fairfield's book, William built his first violin already at age 9 (in 1895), which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker. As many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the United States. The year 1904, when he would be 17‚Äì18 years old, is listed as year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and mistranscribed as Wikanski.1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn As countless Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, he changed his Polish first name Wladyslaw to the English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm in the German speaking partitions of Poland. In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York ‚Äì the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In 1905, William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish and English, as listed in the census of 1920. Initially, William worked in the shop of Oliver Ditson of Boston. In the 1930s, he worked for Fred Gretsch (New York City), out of his own workshop and store in 58 Nassau Street, Brooklyn, New York. William was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s. Career in the United States He was listed as a violin maker in Brooklyn by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the jazz guitar. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \\"his own personal work‚Ä¶no other hand touches them.\\" His violins were offered from $50‚Äì150. Wilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 violas by 1942. Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter W; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also archtop guitars, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known. Although known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars. The guitars were never catalogued. By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D‚ÄôAngelico New Yorker, or a Gibson Guitar Corporation Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.  Features of his guitars  Most of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current Ovation Guitar. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed maple, with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared. Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the Johnny Cash estate auction by Sotheby's in 2004, for 30,000 dollars, to appear again on auctions later.  Personal life, family and death  Researching Wilkanowski's registered family data, it must be noted, that nearly all records until his death in 1954 were filled in cursive handwriting with ink pens by English speaking clerks. These handwritten records are full of spelling mistakes and very vague age and event estimates. None of the census records, marriage certs etc. provide exact dates of birth for any of the family members, typically only registering a loose estimate of age at the time of the census and a variety of misspelled Polish names. This makes exact date estimation of many life events for Wilkanowski quite difficult. William married a fellow Polish immigrant, Michalina Amelia, who came to New York in about 1901. Their wedding photo was provided by family to the biography article. Their marriage was registered twice in May and June of the year 1911, but according to later census records, the couple already had children from around the year 1904. This would mean that Wilkanowski and Amelia either had their first children out of wedlock, or got married any time around 1904, perhaps only registering in a church, as many Catholic Poles would view a church wedding as sufficient for their daily life. She would go by the name Amelia, also registered as Emily or as Emilia (1930 Census). Her maiden name was also listed and misspelled as Glowinska, GrowdanskaPennsylvania, County Marriages, 1885‚Äì1950, marriage of Natalie W. Orth in 1944 and Grobinska.New York City Municipal Deaths 1795‚Äì1949, for Reges, Isabella W. 1945 in New York. Together they seem to have registered 11 children in total, 8 daughters and 3 sons. 9 of their children would survive them ‚Äì the 7 daughters Helene, Genowefa/Genevieve (1907‚Äì1977), Carolyne, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924‚Äì2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922‚Äì1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919‚Äì1969). In the 1940 New York census, Amelia is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \\"Wm\\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children ‚Äì the 3 girls and 2 sons ‚Äì are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 5 oldest daughters already moved out and married.1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \\"Juzek\\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. The Wilkanowski couple had a daughter, Isabella (1912‚Äì1945, married Reges), who worked as a waitress and unfortunately died by accident in Sept. 1945, aged 32. William provided herthe cause of death as carbon monoxide poisoning. In the 1920 census, a 15-year-old boy named Benjamin was listed as the oldest son of the family \\"Wilkanoski\\", with little Theodore being 8 months old. This Benjamin is missing from all later census records and documents. In the 1940s, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War II, and William himself was also registered for draft. Henry was registered in 1942 and started service in 1943 with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,. Grave of Henry Wilkanowski On his draft card, Henry listed his father William as his employer and Edward Wilkanowski as a relative to contact. Theodore was drafted in 1940 in the Young Man Draft and he listed his father as contact and his employer as Wilkanowski + Son (which was the label on the archtop guitars).U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940‚Äì1947 Theodore later became a corporal in WWII. Grave of Theodore J. Wilkanowski William's own registration card from April 1942 has a small but detailed description of him, providing the date and place of his birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \\"Dziatyn\\" (as the Polish small letter ≈Ç looks very much like the Latin t), his age as 56 which was then crossed over and corrected to the factual 55, as he had his birthday in November; his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William did not disclose himself as a luthier, but as self employed. Like Henry, William also listed the Edward Wilkanowski of Russau Street in Brooklyn as a contact. This Edward was most likely the brother of Maximilian J. Wilkanowski, who worked in William's violin shop. The obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday, December 11, 1954 describes in detail the death of William as suicide by hanging and that his body was found Wednesday December 8 in his home by Henry, who stopped by to pick his father up for a family dinner. William was interred on Monday December 13, 1954 in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, Nassau County NY, next to his wife. After his death, a number of unfinished and dusty violins were found in his home. It seems as some of them were then finished by his coworkers or family members, as some Wilkanowski violins have labels dated later than 1952.  Litterature  * Bacon, Tony.

It was developed by Gem Software and published by Amsoft in 1984. It was often included in the free bundles of software that came with the computer. The gameplay is similar to that of the 1981 arcade game Amidar. Gameplay The object of the game is to unveil all of the treasure within each level (or pyramid) of the game whilst avoiding the mummies. Each level consists of a two-dimensional board. In contrast with Pac-Man, when the player's character walks around, footprints are left behind. By surrounding an area of the maze with footprints, its content is revealed, which is either a scroll, a mummy, a key, a tomb or nothing at all. In order to complete a level, it is necessary to unveil the key and a tombstone. The scroll enables the player to kill/eat one mummy on the level. If a mummy is unveiled, it follows the player to the next level. The difficulty and speed of the game increases as the player progresses through the levels. The game is primarily for one player but has a limited multiplayer mode in which players can alternate taking a turn to play each level. Whilst, even at the time, it was considered simple in terms of gameplay, graphics and sound, it was for many people one of the better and more addictive early offerings for the Amstrad. The music played during gameplay is based on the children's song \\"The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid\\". Ports The game was also released for the MSX, ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC 464 and Tatung Einstein. The ZX Spectrum version was given away in one of several introductory software packs for the computer, this particular pack also including Crazy Golf, Alien Destroyer, Punchy, Treasure Island and Disco Dan.

Overview  The word cardioplegia combines the Greek cardio meaning the \\"heart\\", and plegia \\"paralysis\\".http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi- bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&query;=cardioplegia Technically, this means arresting or stopping the heart so that surgical procedures can be done in a still and bloodless field. Most commonly, however, the word cardioplegia refers to the solution used to bring about asystole of the heart, or heart paralysis. One of the first physicians to use the term cardioplegia was Dr. Lam in 1957. However his work on the myocardial protection was preceded serendipitously by Sydney Ringer in the late 1800s. At that time Ringer and colleagues noticed that tap water had the ability to increase contractility of the heart, likely due its high calcium content. Sydney Ringer also commented on the importance of potassium ion concentration on depressing intrinsic heart rhythm. Through a series of experiments performed on frog and canine hearts, reversible arrest was achieved with potassium ions with the consequence of ventricular fibrillation and observed myocardial necrosis. These early experiments started nearly 50 years of work that has led to variety of perfusion strategies available today. The main goals of hypothermic cardioplegia are: # Immediate and sustained electromechanical quiescence # Rapid and sustained homogeneous myocardial cooling # Maintenance of therapeutic additives in effective concentrations # Periodic washout of metabolic inhibitorsKaplan J Cardiac Anesthesia. 3rd Edition. W.B Saunders Company. 1993 The most common procedure for accomplishing asystole is infusing cold cardioplegic solution into the coronary circulation. This process protects the myocardium, or heart muscle, from damage during the period of ischemia.\\"Cold Crystalloid Cardioplegia\\" Hans J. Geissler* and Uwe Mehlhorn, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Cologne To achieve this, the patient is first placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. This device, otherwise known as the heart-lung machine, takes over the functions of gas exchange by the lung and blood circulation by the heart. Subsequently, the heart is isolated from the rest of the blood circulation by means of an occlusive cross-clamp placed on the ascending aorta proximal to the innominate artery. During this period of heart isolation, the heart is not receiving any blood flow, thus no oxygen for metabolism. As the cardioplegia solution distributes to the entire myocardium, the ECG will change and eventually asystole will ensue. Cardioplegia lowers the metabolic rate of the heart muscle, thereby preventing cell death during the ischemic period of time. Physiology Cardioplegic solution is the means by which the ischemic myocardium is protected from cell death. This is achieved by reducing myocardial metabolism through a reduction in cardiac work load and by the use of hypothermia. Chemically, the high potassium concentration present in most cardioplegic solutions decreases the membrane resting potential of cardiac cells. The normal resting potential of ventricular myocytes is about -90 mV. When extracellular cardioplegia displaces blood surrounding myocytes, the membrane voltage becomes less negative and the cell depolarizes more readily. The depolarization causes contraction, intracellular calcium is sequestered by the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps, and the cell relaxes (diastole). However, the high potassium concentration of the cardioplegia extracellular prevents repolarization. The resting potential on ventricular myocardium is about ‚àí84 mV at an extracellular K+ concentration of 5.4 mmol/l. Raising the K+ concentration to 16.2 mmol/l raises the resting potential to ‚àí60 mV, a level at which muscle fibers are inexcitable to ordinary stimuli. When the resting potential approaches ‚àí50 mV, sodium channels are inactivated, resulting in a diastolic arrest of cardiac activity.Hensley F, Martin D. A Practical Approach to Cardiac Anesthesia. 2nd Edition. Little, Brown and Company. 1995 Membrane inactivation gates, or h Na+ gates, are voltage dependent. The less negative the membrane voltage, the more h gates that tend to close. If partial depolarization is produced by a gradual process such as elevating the level of extracellular K+, then the gates have ample time to close and thereby inactivate some of the Na+ channels. When the cell is partially depolarized, many of the Na+ channels are already inactivated, and only a fraction of these channels is available to conduct the inward Na+ current during phase 0 depolarization.Berne R, Levy M. Physiology. 3rd Edition. Mosby St. Louis 1993. The use of two other cations, Na+ and Ca2+, also can be used to arrest the heart. By removing extracellular Na+ from perfusate, the heart will not beat because the action potential is dependent upon extracellular Na+ ions. However, the removal of Na+ does not alter the resting membrane potential of the cell. Likewise, removal of extracellular Ca2+ results in a decreased contractile force, and eventual arrest in diastole. An example of a low [K+] low [Na+] solution is histidine-tryptophan- ketoglutarate. Conversely, increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration enhances contractile force. Elevating Ca2+ concentration to a high enough level results in cardiac arrest in systole. This unfortunate irreversible event is referred to as \\"stone-heart\\" or rigor. Hypothermia is the other key component of most cardioplegic strategies. It is employed as another means to further lower myocardial metabolism during periods of ischemia. The Van 't Hoff equation allows calculation that oxygen consumption will drop by 50% for every 10 ¬∞C reduction in temperature. This Q10 effect combined with a chemical cardiac arrest can reduce myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) by 97%.Gravlee G, Davis R, Utley J. Cardiopulonary Bypass Principles and Practice. Williams & Williams Baltimore 1993. Cold cardioplegia is given into the heart through the aortic root. Blood supply to the heart arises from the aortic root through coronary arteries. Cardioplegia in diastole ensures that the heart does not use up the valuable energy stores (adenosine triphosphate). Blood is commonly added to this solution in varying amounts from 0 to 100%. Blood acts a buffer and also supplies nutrients to the heart during ischemia. Once the procedure on the heart vessels (coronary artery bypass grafting) or inside the heart such as valve replacement or correction of congenital heart defect, etc. is over, the cross-clamp is removed and the isolation of the heart is terminated, so normal blood supply to the heart is restored and the heart starts beating again. The cold fluid (usually at 4 ¬∞C) ensures that the heart cools down to a temperature of around 15‚Äì20 ¬∞C, thus slowing down the metabolism of the heart and thereby preventing damage to the heart muscle. This is further augmented by the cardioplegia component which is high in potassium. When solution is introduced into the aortic root (with an aortic cross-clamp on the distal aorta to limit systemic circulation), this is called antegrade cardioplegia. When introduced into the coronary sinus, it is called retrograde cardioplegia.\\"Cardioplegia Delivery Systems\\" hosted on Washington University, St. Louis, web site  See also  * Action potential * * Cardiopulmonary bypass * Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest * Membrane potential * Resting potential  References   External links  * Category:Cardiac surgery Category:Thoracic surgical procedures ","title":"Cardioplegia"},{"id":"4828498","text":"Serj or Serzh (Armenian: ’ç’•÷Ä’™) is an Armenian given name.

This binary system is composed of a primary star of unknown type, and a white dwarf companion. It erupted in 1928 and 1996 and reached about magnitude 13. Due to its position, coverage of the star by major northern hemisphere observatories is difficult during the winter months and very difficult by major southern hemisphere observatories all year round; it is quite possible that several outbursts have been missed. The July 1996 outburst--unlike the others--proved to be a long, bright one, which caused several observers to wonder if it could possibly be a supermaximum which is indicative of a SU Ursae Majoris star. Observers at Kyoto University carried out V band CCD photometry with the 60 cm reflector and detected superhumps of 0.1 mag amplitude, thus reclassifying DM Lyrae as an SU UMa star.

Title page of The Gospel According to Peanuts, signed by Robert L. Short Life and career Short was born and raised in Midland, Texas. He attended the University of Oklahoma and received a B.A. He then earned a Master of Divinity degree from Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. For the next few years, Short worked as a professional actor, appearing in commercial and religious television, and also directed religious drama. He continued his education, receiving a M.A. in English from North Texas University. In 1963, Short moved to Chicago, where he met his wife, Ellen Kay Coale, and received an M.A. in theology and literature from the University of Chicago. He subsequently engaged in graduate studies in systematic theology at Garrett‚ÄìEvangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University. He and his wife settled in Wilmette, Illinois, where they raised three children. In 1965, Short published his first book, The Gospel According to Peanuts, which used examples from the popular comic strip Peanuts to explain points of Christian theology. It was an immediate success, and was the best-selling non-fiction book in the U.S. for the year. As of 2012 it had sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. The book followed his article, \\"The Penultimate Peanuts\\", published in Motive Magazine in October 1963. Seven additional books followed. Of The Parables of Peanuts (1968), Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz wrote, \\"This new book is filled with wonderful quotes and is a real delight from beginning to end. Actually, I could not possibly be more pleased.\\" Later books included A Time to Be Born‚ÄìA Time to Die (1973), The Gospel from Outer Space (1983), Short Meditations on the Bible and Peanuts (1990), The Gospel According to Dogs: What Our Four- Legged Saints Can Teach Us (2007), and The Parables of Dr. Seuss (2008). The success of his books led to a second career as a speaker, teacher, and guest preacher at churches, schools, and seminaries around the world. He also wrote many articles for magazines, and was a frequent contributor to Motive Magazine, which published his first article on Peanuts. In 1991 Short was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church (USA), and became associate pastor and \\"theologian in residence\\" of the First Presbyterian Church of Brighton, Michigan. He later became head of staff and pastor, specializing in preaching, adult Christian education and confirmation instruction. In 1996, he became minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Monticello, Arkansas. In 2001, Short moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he started a new church of his own: \\"the Church of the Gospel of JESUS (Jesus Exclusively Secured Unconditional Salvation)\\", or \\"Christianity Without Doom and Gloom\\".

Kepatihan A short melody in slendro notated using Kepatihan notation.Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). Javanese Gamelan, p.43-45. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. . Kepatihan is a type of cipher musical notation that was devised for notation of the Indonesian gamelan. =History= The system was devised around 1900 at the Kepatihan (the Grand Vizier's compound) in Surakarta, and was based upon the Galin-Paris-Chev√© system, imported in the nineteenth century by Christian missionaries to allow the notation of hymns.Gamelan: Cultural Interaction and Musical Development in Central Java (1995) by Sumarsam, (cloth) 0226780112 (paper) It superseded several other notation systems of Javanese origin devised around the same time. =Notation= The pitches of the seven-tone p√©log tuning system are designated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; while the five-tone slendro pitches are notated as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The octaves are noted by dots above and below the numbers, as in Chinese jianpu, although of course the pitches do not correspond. A dot over a note indicates the octave above, and a dot below a note represents the octave below. Two dots over a note indicate a note two octaves higher than standard, and so on. Depending on the tuning of the individual gamelan, it is often possible to hear the pitches 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of slendro as an anhemitonic pentatonic scale,Mantle Hood, The Evolution of the Javanese Gamelan, Book II do-re-mi-sol-la. However, in the p√©log system pitches are simply numbered from low to high 1-7 and there is no question of interpreting these sounds diatonically. As the p√©log scale is essentially a five-note scale, the notes 4 and 7 function similarly to 'accidentals' in Western terms: a 4 may serve as a 'sharp' or raised 3 (common in patet lima or nem) or as a 'flat' or lowered 5 (usual in patet barang). Similarly 7 functions as a 'flat' 1 in patet lima or nem; 1 in patet barang may function as a 'sharp' 7, but is more often interpreted as a temporary change of pathet. By default, kepatihan notes are assumed all to have the same duration. Deviations from these regular rhythms are noted in two ways. Beams or lines (overscores) above notes indicate half the standard duration (although this is an area of notation that is often inaccurate in practice). A dot (pin) in the place of a note indicates the continuation of the previous note, not a rest. In vocal parts the figure 0 represents a rest, but rests are not written in instrumental parts, because the instruments normally play continuously and any rests are part of the basic playing style of the instrument. Additional symbols are needed for some instruments; for example, melismas and slurred bowing are noted by lines above or underneath the numbers. Strokes on colotomic instruments are indicated by diacritical marks over or around the kepatihan numbers. There are numerous sets of such marks in use; for example, one set (not an agreed standard) uses a circle for gong ageng, parentheses for gong suwukan, ^ for kenong, Àá for kempul, + for ketuk, and - for kempyang. All or some of these marks may be omitted, as they can usually be determined from the form (bentuk). Performance practice The kepatihan cipher system records the two fixed elements of Javanese gamelan music: the melodic framework (or balungan (literally, skeleton)) represented by numbers, and the set of punctuating gongs that define the form, represented by circles and other symbols. All of the other parts are not notated, but realized by the players at the time of performance, based on their knowledge of the instrument, their training, and the context of the performance (e.g. dance, wayang, concert, wedding, etc.), with the exception of vocal music, which may have lyrics or special melodies that are notated and provided to the singers. In some contemporary compositions, if the classical techniques are not used, more parts might be notated, or just learned by rote in rehearsals. When instruments from other traditions are combined with gamelan (e.g. violin, erhu, tap dancer, bagpipes), notation may be given to those players only if they are accustomed to it.\\"Komposisi Baru\\": On Contemporary Composition in Indonesia Other systems The description above applies to central Javanese music. In the Sundanese music of West Java, the system works in reverse, with 1 representing the highest note instead of the lowest; also a dot over a note indicates the octave below, and a dot below a note represents the octave above. The same notated using the Surakarta method. =Surakarta= The same approximated using Western notation. The Solonese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the pesinden with a squiggle on a horizontal staff. =Yogyakarta= The same notated using the Yogyakarta method or 'chequered notation'. In Yogyakarta a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. Western Kepatihan is widely used in ethnomusicological studies of the gamelan, sometimes accompanied by transcriptions into Western staff notation with approximate mapping of slendro and pelog tuning systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for microtones. The relative merits of kepatihan and staff notation are sometimes debated, but staff notation is essentially incompatible with the 'end-weighted' nature of melodic structures in Indonesian music. In this respect, kepatihan is more suitable, although the usage of overscores (taken from the Galin-Paris-Chev√© system) continues to cause practical difficulties. Computer Fonts for Gamelan Notation The font Kepatihan was developed by Carter Scholz. The font KepatihanPro, now the most widely used computer font for gamelan notation, evolved in two stages: it was designed by Matthew Arciniega around 1994 taking inspiration from Scholz' work, and later spread as PostScript font to be used on the Mac. Around the year of 2000 Raymond Weisling regenerated it as TrueType font (working both on Apple- and Windows-computers), made some adjustments and renamed it to \\"KepatihanPro\\". At the time Apple computers were rare in Indonesia, but the adoption of Windows-based computers for word- processing was spreading rapidly. Therefore the availability of the font for Windows strongly boosted adoption. On 24 July 2020, the Kraton Yogyakarta announced a new font: Kridhamardawa; based on KepatihanPro, it has darker ciphers, a lot of typographical enhancements, and reduces the line-height required to display all diacritical symbols vertically significantly. The codepoints are still compatible with KepatihanPro and follow - like in Scholz' and Arciniega's fonts - a \\"keyboard-logic\\": the fonts should/can be used with an US-American keyboard-driver, and symbols are found at keys that make sense by the typical layout of keyboards. For example the \\"lower-octave\\"-ciphers with \\"dot-below\\" can be accessed by the keys q-w-e-r-t-y-u because those are the keys one line \\"below\\" the number-keys. During the early 2000s multiple simplified offsprings of the Kepatihan-font were widely used for cipher- notation of church hymns all over Indonesia, and reportedly even spread to China. Likely in an attempt to standardise these developments and switch to a Unicode- rather than keyboard-based logic of code-point assignment, SIL International published the font Doulos SIL Cipher in 2014.

Javanese Gamelan, p.48-49. . First line of ladrang form shown above (bottom) with possible balungan (top) and panerus (middle) elaborations.Lindsay (1992), p.49. The panerusan instruments or elaborating instruments are one of the divisions of instruments used in Indonesian gamelan. Instead of the rhythmic structure provided by the colotomic instruments, and the core melody of the balungan instruments, the panerusan instruments play variations on the balungan. They are usually the most difficult instruments to learn in the gamelan, but provide the most opportunity for improvisation and creativity in the performer.Hood, Mantle. The Nuclear Theme as a Determinant of Patet in Javanese Music. New York: Da Capo, 1977. Pages 11‚Äì12. Panerusan instruments include the gend√©r, suling, rebab, siter/celempung, bonang, and gambang. The female singer, the pesindhen, is also often included, as she sings in a similar fashion to the instrumental techniques. As these include the only wind instruments, string instruments, and wooden percussion instruments found in the gamelan, they provide a timbre which stands out from most of the gamelan. The notes that the panerusan instruments play are largely in melodic formulas known as cengkok and sekaran. These are selected from a huge collection which every performer carries in his head, based on the patet, mood, and traditions surrounding a piece. Sekaran Sekaran (Javanese for \\"flowering\\") is a type of elaboration used in the Javanese gamelan, especially on the bonang barung. It is similar to the cengkok of other elaborating instruments in its floridity and openness to improvisation, but a sekaran generally happens only at the end of a nongan or other colotomic division. It is usually preceded by imbal, an interlocking pattern between the bonang barung and the bonang panerus. Different sekaran are used in different pathet, but there are always a variety available. A good bonang player will choose a sekaran based on how the other instruments and the sindhen are improvising. Traditionally the bonang panerus did not play sekaran, and simply continued in the imbal pattern, but now some players use sekaran, as long as they maintain the fast character of typical bonang panerus parts.

In return for payment by Massarone, Tony sends some thugs who brutally beat up the protesters. He and Reverend James are colluding, and they split the payment. Pussy's FBI handler, Skip Lipari, is pressing for information, but Pussy stalls. Tony visits Junior in jail. They argue: Junior tries to convince Tony that Livia had nothing to do with the hit on his life, and that he should make peace with her; Tony mocks him for being manipulated by Livia.

Junior's release from prison on medical grounds is obtained; he is placed under house arrest with an ankle monitor. At an ostensible appointment with his doctor, Junior tells Tony that the owner of Livia's former nursing home, Freddie Capuano, has been gossiping about him, Livia, and Tony. Capuano disappears; a state trooper finds his abandoned Cadillac on waste ground, with his toup√©e lying nearby. He goes to open the trunk. Janice continues to visit her mother in hospital. They antagonize each other, but when Janice plays the old music that Livia loves, they bond for the first time in years. Livia speaks of the money she has hidden; she doesn't remember where. Tony contemptuously tells Janice they deserve each other; she can live with Livia in Livia's house when she leaves the hospital. Talking to his grandmother, A.J. innocently mentions DNR. She realizes that Janice and Tony are considering a DNR instruction for her. One evening Junior slips in the shower and is badly hurt. He speaks of his guilt to Tony and again urges him to make peace with Livia. He will not accept an ambulance, but allows Tony to carry him to Tony's car.

She was the first track and field athlete to compete at six Olympics (1952‚Äì1972). As a teenager Manoliu competed at the national level in tennis, table tennis, volleyball and basketball, before turning to throwing events at the age of 16. Two years later she became the first Romanian woman to throw the disc over 40 m (41.44 m, 22 May 1950). In the mid 1950s she graduated from the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Manoliu finished 6th with a throw of 42.64 m. She bettered this distance in 1956 in Melbourne, throwing 43.90 m for a ninth-place finish. At the 1960 Olympics in Rome, she held the lead after the first round with a throw of 52.36 m, and although she was unable to improve it, the throw was sufficient to earn her the bronze medal. At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Manoliu was outside the podium after round four, but then she produced a throw of 56.96 m to gain her second Olympic bronze medal. In the winter of 1967‚Äì68, the Romanian Athletics Federation informed the 35-year-old Manoliu that she was too old to try for the Olympics again and that she need not bother turning out for their training camp sessions. This only increased her determination, and after months of individual training, she qualified for the Mexico City Olympics. There, she carried an arm injury, and the team doctor warned her that she would not last more than one good throw. Manoliu threw 58.28 m on her first attempt, which proved good enough for the gold medal.Lia Manoliu. sports-reference.com On 19 July 1969, Manoliu won the UK national WAAA discus title at the Crystal Palace, and in 1972, she finished 9th in the discus final at the 1972 Olympics with a throw of 58.50 m. She retired shortly after the 1972 Games, and in 1974 was awarded the UNESCO Fair Play Prize, for her support to the ideals of fair and loyal competition. From 1973 and until her death Manoliu served as vice- president and then as president (since 1990) of the Romanian Olympic Committee. In 1975 she was awarded the Olympic Order in bronze and in 1994 the International Olympic Committee Centennial Trophy. She was a member of the IAAF Women's Committee (1976‚Äì1995) and of the Romanian Senate in the 1990‚Äì1992 legislature. She died of a heart attack in January 1998 after lapsing into a coma during surgery for a brain tumor the week before. She was buried at Bellu Cemetery. Until 2012 The national stadium in Bucharest was named after her.

It opened in 1871 as Franz Josef Station, after Franz Joseph I of Austria. During the First Republic and from 1945 to 1948 the station was called Wilson Station (), after the former President of the United States Woodrow Wilson. In 2014, the station served 224,505 trains (610 daily) and more than 53,000,000 passengers. Overview leftThe Art Nouveau station building and station hall were built between 1901 and 1909, designed by Czech architect, Josef Fanta, on the site of the old dismantled Neo-Renaissance station designed by Czech architects Anton√≠n Viktor Barvitius and Vojtƒõch Ign√°c Ullmann. The station was extended by a new terminal building, built between 1972 and 1979, including an underground metro station and a main road on the roof of the terminal. The new terminal building claimed a large part of the park, and the construction of the road cut off the neo-renaissance station hall from the town. Interior of the new Terminal building completed in 1977, refurbished in 2011In 2011 a partial refurbishment of the station was completed by Italian company Grandi Stazioni, which has leased retail space for 30 years from 2002. In 2016 Grandi Stazioni has lost the concession after failing to complete the renovation of the historic building by the extended contractual deadline.

He married Ethel Schwabacher in 1934. She was a protegee of Arshile Gorky, his first biographer, and herself a well-known abstract impressionist painter. Brenda Webster, their daughter, is an American writer. After World War II they lived on the Upper East Side. Dorothy Parker was a social acquaintance. Wolf and Ethel Schwabacher shared a house with the psychoanalyst Muriel Gardiner and her husband, the Austrian socialist Joseph Buttinger, for more than ten years. After Gardiner and Buttinger, fleeing from Europe after the start of World War II, moved into their house at Brookdale Farm in central New Jersey in 1940, the house was divided in two, the Gardiner-Buttingers living in one part of the house and the Schwabachers in the other. The Schwabacher-Gardiner connection came to public attention during the libel suit Hellman brought against Mary McCarthy. When Hellman published her memoir, Pentimento (1973), Gardiner spotted the close similarity between her own anti-Fascist activities in Vienna in the 1930s and the story Hellman told about a pseudonymous friend called Julia. Gardiner wrote to Hellman asking for an explanation, but Hellman never replied. Hellman, who never met Gardiner, claimed that her Julia was somebody else. Many people believe otherwise, citing the vanishingly low probability that there were two millionaire American medical students in Vienna in the late 1930s who married the head of a resistance movement and were active in that movement. It is believed that Hellman learned Gardiner's story from Schwabacher who had visited Gardiner in Vienna in the 1930s and whose garrulous nature made it very likely that he had related the story of Gardiner's activities to his contacts.

The film is based on the 1956 novel of the same name by Meyer Levin, which in turn was a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder trial. It was the first film produced by Richard D. Zanuck. Although the principal roles are played by Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman, top billing went to Orson Welles. Plot Close friends Judd Steiner (based on Nathan Leopold and played by Dean Stockwell) and Artie Strauss (based on Richard Loeb and played by Bradford Dillman) kill a boy on his way home from school in order to commit the \\"perfect crime\\". Strauss tries to cover it up, but they are caught when police find a key piece of evidence -- Steiner's glasses, which he inadvertently left at the scene of the crime. Famed attorney Jonathan Wilk (based on Clarence Darrow and played by Orson Welles) takes their case, saving them from hanging by making an impassioned closing argument against capital punishment. Cast Production Welles, whose recent thriller Touch of Evil was overlooked in America (though appreciated in Europe), was bitter at not being selected to direct Compulsion. His time on the set was tense, and he threw frequent tantrums. In the early 1950s, Meyer Levin visited Nathan Leopold in prison and requested that Leopold cooperate with him on writing a novel based on the murder (the other murderer, Richard Loeb, was dead at that point). Leopold declined saying he didn't wish his story told in fictionalized form but asked Levin if he could help him write his memoir. Levin was unhappy with that suggestion and wrote the novel anyway, releasing it in 1956. The novel was called Compulsion, the book the film is based on. Leopold would read the book and reportedly didn't like it. Leopold later wrote that reading the book made him \\"physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience.\\"In Nathan Leopold's Own Words.UMKC archive. Retrieved August 1, 2014. In 1959, Leopold sought unsuccessfully to block production of the film on the grounds that Levin's book had invaded his privacy, defamed him, profited from his life story, and \\"intermingled fact and fiction to such an extent that they were indistinguishable.\\" Eventually the Illinois Supreme Court ruled against him,Leopold v. Levin, 259 N.E.2d 250, 255‚Äì56 (Ill. 1970); GERTZ, supra note 48, at 166. noting that Leopold, as the self-confessed perpetrator of the \\"crime of the century\\" could not reasonably demonstrate that Levin's book had damaged his reputation.Larson EJ.

Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court decision involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides a private cause of action to victims of employment discrimination.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can be found in the United States Code at et seq. The Court ruled that Title VII's \\"employee-numerosity requirement,\\" which limits potential defendants to those maintaining at least fifteen employees, is not a limit on a court's jurisdiction to hear Title VII claims. The requirement is instead a substantive element of a Title VII claim, which means that a defendant must raise the issue prior to verdict or the requirement will be waived.  Background  Jenifer Arbaugh was employed as a bartender and waitress at the Moonlight Cafe, a New Orleans restaurant, from May 2000 until February 2001. During this time, she alleged that she was continually sexually harassed by one of the restaurant's owners. On November 8, 2001, Arbaugh filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, asserting claims against Y & H Corporation (the operator of the Moonlight Cafe) and the owner she alleged harassed her. Her complaint alleged sexual harassment in violation of Title VII, in addition to various tort claims under Louisiana state law. Arbaugh's complaint asserted that her Title VII claim invoked the court's federal question jurisdiction to hear her case.. = District Court proceedings = After a two-day jury trial in October 2002, a $40,000 verdict was returned in favor of Arbaugh. Two weeks later, Y&H; filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting for the first time in the litigation that it did not qualify as an \\"employer\\" under Title VII because it did not employ fifteen or more employees for 20 or more calendar weeks during the relevant time period.This definition of \\"employer\\" is set forth in . If Arbaugh did not state a valid claim under Title VII, Y&H; argued that she accordingly failed to invoke federal question jurisdiction. Though the district court considered it \\"unfair and a waste of judicial resources\\" for the defendant to raise the issue after trial had already been conducted, the court nevertheless ordered both parties to conduct post-trial discovery on the issue, because objections to subject matter jurisdiction could be raised at any stage of litigation.Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). After converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, the district court determined that the employer criteria were not satisfied, because Y&H;'s delivery drivers, owner-managers, and their shareholder wives were not \\"employees\\" for Title VII purposes, and the company could not meet the requirement without their inclusion. The court vacated its prior judgment in favor of Arbaugh, dismissed her Title VII claim with prejudice, and her state-law claims without prejudice. = Court of Appeals decision = Arbaugh appealed the reversal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's decision.Judge Harold R. DeMoss, Jr. wrote the panel's opinion, which was joined by Judge Edith Brown Clement. Judge Emilio M. Garza concurred in the judgment only, without filing a separate opinion. Bound by its prior decisions, the Court of Appeals held that a defendant's failure to qualify as an \\"employer\\" under Title VII deprives a district court of subject matter jurisdiction.Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 380 F.3d 219, 224 (5th Cir. 2004). The court ruled that dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction was proper because the record warranted the conclusion that Y&H; did not employ the requisite 15 employees.Id. at 225-231.  Opinion of the Court  Arbaugh petitioned for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted review of the decision to resolve conflicting opinions among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether Title VII's employee-numerosity requirement was jurisdictional or simply an element of a plaintiff's claim for relief. The U.S. Solicitor General was granted permission to participate in oral argument as amicus curiae, to argue in support of Arbaugh's legal interpretation.Motion granted, 126 S. Ct. 326 (2005). The Supreme Court unanimouslyThe Supreme Court's decision was 8-0; Justice Samuel Alito was confirmed to the Court after it had already heard oral argument, and so did not participate. reversed the Fifth Circuit's decision in an opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, holding that the threshold number of employees for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff's claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue. = Ginsburg's majority opinion = The Court first noted that federal question case law often erroneously conflated subject matter jurisdiction requirements with the required elements of a claim for relief. Courts often did not specify whether a case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim. The Supreme Court had itself in prior Title VII decisions declined to comment on whether the lower court had properly designated the plaintiff's failure to state a claim under Title VII as a failure to establish subject matter jurisdiction, preferring instead to focus on the lower court's construction of the statute. The court described the three main consequences that followed from subject matter jurisdiction limitations, and found that these did not apply to the employee-numerosity requirement. First, because subject matter jurisdiction involves a court's power to hear a case, it can never be forfeited or waived. All courts have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party. The Court believed that nothing in the text of Title VII indicated that Congress intended courts, on their own motion, to assure that the employee-numerosity requirement was met. Second, if subject-matter jurisdiction turns on contested facts, the trial judge may be authorized to review the evidence and resolve the dispute on her own. By contrast, if satisfaction of an essential element of a claim for relief is at issue, the jury is the proper trier of fact. Third, when a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the complaint in its entirety, which is why the trial court dismissed Arbaugh's state-law claims even though they had already been tried and determined by a jury. In contrast, when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear the state-law claims.Supplemental jurisdiction is granted to federal courts by . The Court noted that Congress could make the employee-numerosity requirement \\"jurisdictional\\" if it wanted to, similar to how it made the \\"amount-in- controversy\\" threshold an ingredient of subject matter jurisdiction in delineating diversity jurisdiction.. However, the 15-employee threshold appears in a separate provision from Title VII's jurisdictional provision, (authorizing jurisdiction over actions \\"brought under\\" Title VII). and does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts. Given the \\"unfairness\\" and \\"waste of judicial resources,\\" entailed in tying the employee-numerosity requirement to subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court considered it \\"the sounder course\\" to refrain from construing the requirement as jurisdictional. The Court concluded by stating that \\"when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\\"  Footnotes  External links * * Brief for the United States as amicus curiae supporting petitioner Arbaugh * Transcript of the Supreme Court arguments Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2006 in United States case law ","title":"Arbaugh v.

The Fittipaldi FD04 was Divila's last design for Fittipaldi. It is seen here during the 1976 season with two-time world champion Emerson Fittipaldi at the wheel. Ricardo Ramsey \\"Richard\\" Divila (30 May 1945 ‚Äì 25 April 2020) was a Brazilian motorsports designer. He worked in Formula One, Formula Two, Formula Three, Formula 3000 and sports car racing.  Life and career  Divila was born in S√£o Paulo. He had a very close relationship with Wilson and Emerson Fittipaldi. He started by designing Formula Vee and various sports cars for them in Brazil in the 1960s. When the brothers established the Fittipaldi Automotive team in Formula One he became the technical director and designed the team's first three cars. These three cars had the name \\"FD\\" based on Fittipaldi's \\"F\\" and Divila's \\"D\\" like the Brabham's \\"BT\\" (Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac). He remained with the team until it closed down in 1982. Afterwards, he worked for many teams in many categories - in particular with Ligier in Formula One and with Nissan in various sports car series. Between 1988 and 1989 he designed a Formula One car for Lamberto Leoni, a former F1 driver who intended to enter his FIRST GP team in the championship. Although the team had contracts with Judd and Pirelli as engine and tyre suppliers, and with Gabriele Tarquini as a driver, the team did not race that year. It was Divila's last chance to see an F1 car designed by him racing, especially as his designs were altered to become the L190 run by the short-lived Life Racing Engines. From the 1990s, he worked for some Japanese racing teams such as Nismo, SARD, and Dome. He died in France, aged 74.

The ride consists of a number of cars which spin freely while rotating around a central point, in much the same way as a carousel. As the cars revolve, the floor of the ride undulates over a track so that the cars rise and fall gently as the ride spins. The offset weight of the riders causes each car to rotate. The riders experience varying levels of g-force from the spinning of the car, and the rotation of the ride itself. Because of this, it is suitable for young people and adults ‚Äì operators will impose height and age restrictions.  Operation  The operator of the ride sits in the ‚Äòpaybox‚Äô and makes the ride stop and start, and collects money from the staff who typically ride the platform and spin the cars by hand. Riders sits on the bench seat of the car and are held in place by a locking restraining bar. Traditional Waltzer platforms are surrounded by a gangway, where would-be riders can stand and wait for their turn. This was often an important social aspect of fairs, especially for teenagers. Due to health and safety regulations, this is no longer permitted on British fairs. In static amusement parks, there are often differences in the operation, such as an organised queue system and ride controls located away from the ride platform.  History and Development  The Waltzer was invented by Mr Dennis Jefferies of Congleton, Cheshire C1920. The first 'passengers' were his nieces, Phyllis and Dolly Booth. The Booth family retain the original drawings to this day. A later Waltzer, completed in 1933, was built for an English showman the ride has stayed in the family and still travels today. The Waltzer is a variety of ‚ÄòNoah‚Äôs Ark ride‚Äô, a fairground ride first imported from Germany in 1930. Although the first Waltzer was made by Lakins for Thurston in 1933, the ride became strongly associated with the Scottish firm Maxwell and Sons of Musselburgh. Waltzers originally had 10 cars. However, several Ark rides have been converted into a waltzer, therefore 9 and 11 car variations can be found. Some Waltzer cars had brakes that activate automatically when the safety bar is open. Newer models usually have a complex braking system that stops each car, making them face outwards automatically once the car is stationary. Waltzers remain popular at travelling and small seaside funfairs, but are less common at static amusement parks.

History Kingsley and Froghall station, situated on the Churnet Valley Line of the North Staffordshire Railway, was opened to both passengers and goods on 1 September 1849. The station was a busy country station serving the needs of workers at nearby Thomas Bolton's copper refinery. As with many UK railways, passenger numbers in the 1960s decreased to such an extent that the station was closed to both passengers and goods in 1965. Re-opening, and the Churnet Valley Railway The station from the road overbridge looking southeast in 2010 During the 1970s a railway preservation base was set up at nearby Cheddleton station. This was later to become the base of the Churnet Valley Railway (CVR). The CVR had slowly been progressing in preserving the line when in the late 1990s they had reached the station site. After closure by British Rail, the station buildings had been demolished. Initial rebuilding of the station resulted in the down platform reopening for passengers on 11 August 2001. Construction later began on the new station building which opened on 19 July 2003. Since 2003, more work has been done on the station to make the site \\"complete\\" as at nearby Consall. Initially this involved resurfacing the down platform and adding fences, a few small buildings and station furniture. With this side now relatively complete, attention has been turned to the second (up) platform where the overhang on the canal and associated fences have been rebuilt, along with walls and the large waiting shelter but this platform is not in use. Kingsley and Froghall is currently the southern limit of passenger operations on the CVR, but plans exist to extend towards Oakamoor and Alton Towers.

She was a prot√©g√© and first biographer of Arshile Gorky, and friends with many of the prominent painters of New York at that time, including Willem de Kooning, Richard Pousette-Dart, Kenzo Okada, and Jos√© Guerrero. She was also the author of a monograph on the artist John Ford and a memoir, \\"Hungry for Light\\". Biography Schwabacher was born in New York in 1903. Her family moved to Pelham in 1908 where she first began painting in her garden. She attended Horace Mann School and at age 15 enrolled at the Art Students League of New York. She also studied sculpture at the National Academy of Design until 1921. During 1921, Arnold Genthe took several photographs of her. After her apprenticeship in stone carving with the sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, in 1927 Schwabacher abandoned sculpture and enrolled in Max Weber's painting class at the Art Students League. That year she met Arshile Gorky, with whom she developed a lasting friendship. She lived in Europe from 1928 to 1934. She and Gorky took independent studies together between 1934 and 1936. Gorky introduced her to automatism. She was inspired by Gorky's biomorphic abstractions and erotic forms. In the 1930s she began to explore her own sub-conscious, combining automatism with abstract forms, referring to nature. Schwabacher often interconnected themes of womanhood, childbirth, and children. In 1934, she married the prominent entertainment lawyer Wolf Schwabacher and had two children: Brenda Webster, American critic and novelist; and Christopher Schwabacher a lawyer in New York. Her cousin George Oppen, an objectivist poet who went on to win the Pulitzer Prize, also lived in New York in the 1930s. Following the untimely death of her husband, she expressed her personal traumas through the a series of figurative paintings based on Greek myths. She died on November 25, 1984. Schwabacher's work is included in the collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Jewish Museum, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the Rockefeller University in New York City. Her work has been exhibited in a number of galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery, the Betty Parsons Gallery and the Green-Ross Gallery in New York City. Her work was featured in \\"Women of Abstract Expressionism\\" at the Denver Art Museum from June‚ÄìSeptember, 2016, and at the Palm Springs Art Museum in 2017.  Gendered Themes  Much like her female abstract expressionist contemporary Lee Krasner, whose work was cast in her husband‚Äôs shadow until his death, Schwabacher‚Äôs work stands as an example of gender politics in art as her works are continually attributed her role as a woman, wife, and mother.Wagner, Anne M. \\"Lee Krasner as L.K.\\" Representations, no. 25 (1989): 42-57. doi:10.2307/2928466. Her allusion to Greek themes and myths in the Odes series are said to have been influenced by the death of her husband, but this assertion fails to consider her interest in the Surrealism movement. She uses loose brushstrokes and bold colors to explore themes central to the abstract expressionist movement ‚Äî Freudian psychology, dream states, and the unconscious.

Its original recipe was created in Gothenburg during the early 19th century. History Its origins are atypical for Swedish snus brands, as the recipe evolved through trial and error among sailors on merchant ships mooring in the port of Gothenburg. Unable to afford high-quality ingredients, these seamen added different spices to their loose smokeless tobacco, hereby creating their personal snus blends. A few of these blends were sold locally under 'brand names'. G√∂teborgs Rap√© was made from selected hand-ripped tobacco giving the snus \\"... a mild and sweet tobacco flavor with tones of juniper berry and fresh herbs\\". Although popular, it was initially rarely sold outside the Gothenburg region. In order to create funding for the country's defence and one of the first pension reforms, the state monopolized the entire Swedish tobacco industry in 1915. After the take- over, the state monopoly, controlled 103 brands of snus, of which no less than 25 were from Gothenburg. In order to slim the portfolio, the recipes were put in front of a jury. A tasting was conducted and in 1919 only five remained.

That problem, in short, is how to account for the common-sense idea that intentional thoughts or intentional mental states are causes of intentional actions. The problem divides into several distinct sub-problems, including the problem of causal exclusion, the problem of anomalism, and the problem of externalism. However, the sub-problem which has attracted most attention in the philosophical literature is arguably the exclusion problem.  Description  The basic problem of mental causation is an intuitive one: on the face of it, it seems that mental events cause physical events (and vice versa), but how can mental events have any causal effect on physical events? Suppose that a person, John, orders dessert after dinner. It seems that at least one cause for such a physical, behavioral event is that John desired to have dessert and believed that by ordering dessert he would be able to soon have dessert. But, how can such mental events as beliefs and desires cause John's mouth to move in such a way that he orders dessert?  Sub-problems of mental causation  = Exclusion problem = What follows is a summary of the causal exclusion problem in its simplest form, and it is merely one of several possible formulations. To the extent that we do not have to go outside human physiology in order to trace the causal antecedents of any bodily movement, intentional action can be fully causally explained by the existence of these physiological antecedents alone. No mention of mental states need enter into the explanation. This troubles philosophers because intuitively it seems that mental states are crucial in causing a person to act (for example, their beliefs and desires). But, given that physiological facts are sufficient to account for action, mental states appear to be superfluous; they are at risk of being causally and explanatorily irrelevant with respect to human action . Many philosophers consider this apparent irrelevance to be a highly counter- intuitive and undesirable position to take. It ultimately leads to epiphenomenalism‚Äîthe view that mental events or states are causally irrelevant, they are merely after effects that play no role in any causal chains whatsoever. Thomas Huxley famously noted that epiphenomenalism treats mental states like the steam coming off a train: it plays no causal role in the train's moving forward, it is merely an \\"emergent property\\" of the actual causation occurring in the engine . = Problem of anomalism = Another problem with mental causation is that mental events seem anomalous in the sense that there are no scientific laws that mental states can figure into without having exceptions. There are no \\"strict\\" laws, and mental events must factor into strict laws in order to fit respectably into the causal order described by current science [see ]. In short, one response has been to deny that psychological laws involving mental states require strict, exceptionless laws. Jerry Fodor argues that non-basic (or \\"special\\") sciences do not in fact require strict laws . In current practice, special sciences (for example, biology and chemistry) have ceteris paribus laws (or laws with \\"all else being equal\\" clauses), according to which there are exceptions. However, only in the basic sciences (physics) are there strict, exceptionless laws. Thus, although mental states are anomalous, they can still figure into scientifically respectable laws of psychology. = Problem of externalism = In the latter half of the twentieth century externalism about meaning became espoused by many philosophers. Externalism is roughly the view that certain parts of an individual's environment play a crucial role in the meaning of at least some of an individual's words [see and ]. A thesis about meaning affects the mind insofar as our thoughts are about things in the world. A common view in the philosophy of mind is that at least certain mental states have intentional content in this sense. For example, one's belief that water is wet has the semantic content of water is wet. The thought is about water and the fact that it is wet. But, if externalism is true‚Äîif some of the contents of one's thoughts are constituted at least in part by factors external to one's mind‚Äîthen there is yet another difficulty in explaining how mental states can cause physical states ].  Commonsensical Solutions  =Causal Exclusion Counter-Argument= Causal exclusion is only a problem for mental causation if you are an advocate for physicalism. Jaegwon Kim‚Äôs causal exclusion argument states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, and no physical effects are caused twice over by distinct physical and mental causes, there cannot be any irreducible mental causes (Kallestrup 2006). First of all, the antecedent of the causal exclusion argument is the definition of physicalism. Kim states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. This statement alone negates dualism, idealism and mental causation. Whereas, it is redundant to state the remaining of the causal exclusion argument because if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then no physical effects would be caused twice over by any substance other than physical. Also, if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then there clearly would not be any reducible or irreducible mental causes. Secondly, if a person does not support physicalism, then they are not going to support the view that all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. Lastly, physicalism is the hypothesis that the mind is the same as the brain and/or the mental supervenes on the physical, yet it is not fact. Therefore, to use the hypothesis of causal exclusion as evidence to counter mental causation is no different than using \\"the popper's three world formulation\\" or \\"psychological nativism\\" (as shown in this section) to support mental causation. =The Advent of Crying= It is an arduous task to prove mental causation within the realms of a physical body. Yet, every human has witnessed mental causation within the human body. Let us view the advent of crying. Crying is a physical effect coupled with either a physical cause or a mental (emotional) cause. There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflex tears, and emotional tears (Hoyt 2008). Basal tears keep our eyes from drying out, reflex tears are in response to eye irritants (physical causation), and emotional tears are a result of mental causation such as sadness, joy, etc (Hoyt 2008). I am going to focus on the latter, emotional tears. Once sadness is registered in the cerebrum, the endocrine system releases hormones to the ocular area, and tears are formed (Hoyt 2008). Crying due to one's mental state is an event that is common across all cultures and demographics. Whether we cry due to sadness or joy, these are all events that have their origination in mental causation. It would be inhuman to claim otherwise. How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by Lisa Feldman Barrett for a rigorous discussion. One‚Äôs crying is not planned, unless one is an actor, then we are able to tap into the mechanism that causes tears to flow. Otherwise it just happens outside of out awareness of causing it by thinking. The brain has patterns of neurons that once activated generate physiologic responses that happens up to 10 seconds before we are aware. (Koch, Christof. 2012. ‚ÄúHow Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your ‚ÄúFree‚Äù Will‚Äù. Scientific American: April 12.) and many others. Traditional Solutions = Dualist solutions = Some have claimed that while the mental and the physical are quite different things, they can nonetheless causally interact with one another, a view going back to Descartes [, especially meditations II & VI]. This view is known as interactionist dualism. The major problem that interactionist dualism faces is that of explicating a satisfactory notion of causation according to which non- spatial events, such as mental events, can causally interact with physical events. According to the current mainstream scientific world-view, the physical realm is causally closed, in that causal relationships only hold among physical events in the physical realm. Given these types of considerations, some argue that it is appropriate to say that the main assumptions in interactionist dualism generate the problem of mental causation rather than solve it (see . = Physicalist solutions = The other major option is to assert that mental events are either (at least contingently) identical to physical events, or supervene on physical events. Views that fall under this general heading are called physicalism or materialism. But, such views require a particular theory to explain how mental events are physical in nature. One such theory is behaviorism. Behaviorists, in general, argue that mental events are merely dispositions to behave in certain ways. Another theory is the identity theory, according to which mental events are (either type- or token-) identical to physical events. A more recent view, known as functionalism, claims that mental events are individuated (or constituted by) the causal role they play. As such, mental events would fit directly into the causal realm, as they are simply certain causal (or functional) roles. Finally, there is eliminative materialism, which simply denies that there are any such mental events; thus, there is really no problem of mental causation at all. = Idealism-Related solutions =  Popper's three-world formulation  Related to dualism above, a more general and somewhat differently posed approach to mental causation is provided by Karl Popper's three worlds. Popper split the world into three categories: # The world of physical objects and events, including biological entities # The mental or psychological world, the world of our feelings of pain and of pleasure, of our thoughts, of our decisions, of our perceptions and our observations; in other words, the world of mental or psychological states or processes, or of subjective experiences. # The world of products of the human mind, including art, science, and religion. World 3 includes physical theory as a particular case. But World 3 is a creation of the human imagination, and such acts of imagination are a part of World 2. Accordingly, one could argue that the physical notion of causality is a child of the imagination, and although causation has its successes in describing World 1, it may not apply to World 2 or World 3. The subjective aspects of theories contained in World 3 are not readily framed within the third-person perspective of science used to explain World 1. From this perspective, it is hubris to suppose that the methods successful in describing World 1, in particular to suppose the notions of cause and effect, invented by World 2 in its creation of the theory of World 3 used to explain World 1, have direct application to Worlds 2 and 3 themselves, and control mental agency.  Psychological nativism  A still different approach to mental causation is based upon the philosophies of Kant, Chomsky and Pinker. These philosophers stress the impact of built-in aspects of mind, studied in the field of psychological nativism. Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) pointed out that we all shape our experience of things through the filter of our mind, a view sometimes called epistemological solipsism. The mind shapes that experience, and among other things, Kant believed the concepts of space and time were programmed into the human brain, as was the notion of cause and effect. We never have direct experience of things, the noumenal world, and what we do experience is the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses, this conveyance processed by the machinery of the mind and nervous system. Kant focused upon this processing. Kant believed in a priori knowledge arrived at independent of experience, so-called synthetic a priori knowledge. In particular, he thought that by introspection some aspects of the filtering mechanisms of the mind/brain/nervous system could be discovered. The following observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject-object problem, called Kant's Copernican revolution: Although Kant has posed the issue of built-in aspects of mind, the particulars that depend upon the science of his day have become outmoded. A more recent approach to these limitations is proposed by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. Like Kant, Noam Chomsky raised the issue of the mind's inherent programming. Chomsky selected as a particular example the acquiring of language by children. Of course, language is indispensable in the formulation and communication of our perceptions of the objective world: Chomsky marshaled evidence that a child's rapid mastery of the complexity of language indicated an innate ability programmed into the development of the human mind from birth that could not be explained by the \\"blank slate\\" view of the infant mind. Rather, the mind has a built-in propensity to process symbolic representations. The origins of this ability were sought by Steven Pinker in a Darwinian struggle that established the survival value of the ability to communicate. According to Pinker, Charles Darwin himself \\"concluded that language ability is 'an instinctive tendency to acquire an art', a design that is not peculiar to humans but seen in other species such as song-learning birds.\\" This observation is strongly supported by research on crows. This work can be taken to suggest that although a physical theory is an intermediary between our observations and our notions of connections between them, it is an elaborate mental construction that is a meld of the way the mind works and objective observations. Although a physical theory is used to determine connections about objective events, the specific form of the theoretical construct is a product of subjective activities, and this particular form may well involve the workings of the brain. Perhaps some aspects of the universe's operation can be expressed in terms of mental constructs, but this process is analogous with the expression of a computer algorithm in terms of assembly language instructions peculiar to a particular computer, a translation by a compiler of the general statement of an algorithm into specific tiny steps that particular computer can handle. From this standpoint, as with the philosophy of Kant, the first-person active actions of mental causation may involve innate workings of the brain itself.

Rough Guides: The Rough Guide to Rock, 1999. p. 1690. Biography In 1976, Rogers entered the Royal College of Music, London, later becoming an associate (ARCM) and winning their guitar prize in 1980. Upon leaving he joined Ballet Rambert's Mercury Ensemble as their guitarist. During this period he composed several ballet scores, including Entre Dos Aguas and Fabrications for London Contemporary Dance Theatre. He also made his first commercial hit, joining the South American folk music group Incantation who enjoyed some UK and international chart success in the early 1980s, their best known single being \\"Cacharpaya\\". In 1985, Rogers left both Rambert and Incantation and joined the post-punk group the Fall, initially as temporary bassist replacing Stephen Hanley. After Hanley's return from paternity leave, Rogers joined the Fall as on guitar and keyboards for the album This Nation's Saving Grace and co-writing several songs on the follow-up Bend Sinister. He produced their top 20 album The Frenz Experiment (1988) before parting company with the group. During this period, he also produced two albums for Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy. He began to compose for television whilst at Rambert and his credits include TV dramas such as The Old Men at the Zoo (1982), Much Ado About Nothing (1983) and The Rainbow (1988) as well as two American TV movies, Daddy (1987) and The Preppie Murder (1989) for ABC. In the 1990s, Rogers continued to work in music production, beginning a long association with the Lightning Seeds, for whom he co-produced the albums Sense, Jollification, Dizzy Heights and Tilt as well as the football anthem \\"Three Lions\\". He also returned to The Fall to produce the majority of The Infotainment Scan. Throughout the '90s he was also involved with underground dance music, remixing under the names RAMP and Slacker. Slacker signed to XL in '97 and had two hits, \\"Scared\\" and \\"Your Face\\" during their time on the label. There were also several successful releases on Boy George's More Protein label, including Generations of Love and Everything Starts with an E. He has also developed solo projects such as Leuroj and T-Era for the Skint/Loaded labels, and Steiger for John Digweed‚Äôs Bedrock Records label. In 2003, he returned to television music, scoring 40 (starring Eddie Izzard and Kerry Fox) for Channel 4. Work on other productions followed swiftly after the first broadcast of the series including ITV's Rebus, starring Ken Stott, various episodes of BBC's Dalziel and Pascoe and Jon Howe's film Streets which was selected for the Venice Film Festival of 2004. Other credits include scores for South Africa, Murder Most Foul, Ochberg's Orphans and Dancing with the Devil in the City of God, directed by Oscar-winning documentary maker Jon Blair and the title music for Hustle (Kudos/Spooks Ltd for BBC One), which was nominated for the Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music Emmy Award in 2007.

Maryland in 2006alt=Six women, wearing a uniform of a white skirt and a white and gold cropped top with the word \\"Tech\\" on the front, ride onto the football field on the running boards and rear seat of a white-and-gold-painted antique car. The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe that serves as the official mascot of the student body at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions. Its most noticeable role is leading the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin' Reck Club. The first mechanical Wreck was a 1914 Ford Model T owned by Dean Floyd Field. Until the current Wreck was donated to the school in 1961, most of the early Ramblin' Wrecks were owned by students, faculty or alumni. The modern Wreck has donned a number of different paint jobs and has had several restorations and modifications made to it. These changes were made by various individuals and organizations over the years, including Bobby Dodd and Georgia Tech Alumni Pete George, who worked at the Ford plant in Hapeville, Georgia. The upkeep of the Wreck has been the sole responsibility of Ramblin' Reck Club and the Wreck driver since 1987. The Ramblin' Wreck has been the target of several pranks perpetrated by rival schools; the University of Tennessee once provided the Wreck with an unsolicited new paint job, and the University of Georgia has stolen the Wreck on at least two occasions. Several replica or \\"false\\" Wrecks are owned by alumni, or are used for display and do not run. The official Ramblin' Wreck is considered the only \\"true\\" Wreck, and no backups or replacements exist.  History  BobCat\\" Field, owner of the first \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" The term \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the car that now bears the name has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of Central America. The Wrecks were constructed from whatever the engineers could find‚Äîmostly old tractor and automotive parts‚Äîand were kept running by the engineers' ingenuity and creativity. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as \\"Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech.\\" The first \\"mechanical mascot\\" at Georgia Tech was a 1914 Ford Model T owned by Dean Floyd Field. Field drove the car to and from class every day from 1916 until 1928. Field cared so much for the car that he even nicknamed it \\"Nellie\\". The vehicle was distinguished by its metallic black paint job and a large black box fastened to the rear end by a buggy wheel hoop. The black box's contents were never revealed to the student body and the box became part of the mystique of the Old Ford. The student body initially nicknamed the vehicle \\"Floyd's Flivver\\" but eventually began to call the car the \\"Ramblin' 'Reck.\\" The first mention of Field's Ford as a Ramblin' 'Reck was in 1926 when he performed an overhaul of the car's engine, body, and paint job with the help of the campus machine shop. Dean Field found a love for travel with his Model T. He took it all the way to California for seminars on mathematics and education. However, in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was going to buy a Model A. Field quelled the rumors with a personal interview in the last issue of the 1927 Technique. By September 1928, Field felt he could not travel as much with the dilapidated Model T. To the dismay of the student body the vehicle was discarded by Dean Field in 1928 and a Model A was purchased. Field's Model A lasted until 1934 in which he bought a Ford V8. He would drive over in all three cars during his Georgia Tech tenure of 1900‚Äì1945. The Ramblin' Wreck engine, built in October 1929 In memoriam to his retired \\"Tin Lizzie\\", Dean Field started \\"an Old Ford Race\\" from the intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive in Atlanta to the intersection of Hills Street and Prince Avenue in Athens. The race was sponsored by the Technique, which nicknamed the event the \\"Flying Flivver Race.\\" The finish line was facilitated by the University of Georgia student newspaper The Red and Black. The only rule of the race was that the car had to be a pre-1926 4-cylinder motor car. The fastest time in the race was achieved by an Essex which completed the 79-mile (126 km) race in 1 hour and 26 minutes or 55 mph (88 km/h). The Tech administration disliked the perilous race and reduced the race to a more peaceful and regulated parade of contraptions known as the Ramblin' Wreck Parade after races were completed in 1929 and 1930. The Yellow Jacket Club facilitated the first official Ramblin' Wreck parade in 1932. The only break in the parade's continuous operation occurred with the onset of World War II. There were no parades from 1942‚Äì1943 and when the parade did continue in 1944, all Wrecks had to be human powered. In 1946, the Ramblin' Wreck Parade was allowed to operate combustion engines again. The rules instituted in the 1946 Wreck Parade still remain as the parade has become the featured event for all Tech homecomings. = Mascot for students = Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. Johnson had purchased the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore the car as a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson used spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000, but eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck was unveiled September 30, 1961, at Grant Field in front of 43,501 Tech fans, as it led the team onto the field against Rice University. The team prevailed 24‚Äì0 and the Wreck became an instant success within the Tech family. The Wreck has since led the team onto the field for every home game. = Bobby Dodd's restorations = The Ramblin‚Äô Wreck at the 1969 Tech homecoming parade shown in its original color scheme The current color scheme was selected in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield on both the driver- and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold, he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme. The biggest structural change was a support system attached to the car's frame. The support system runs the length of the running boards and allows the increased weight of cheerleaders or Reck Club members standing on the running boards. = Pete George's restorations = From 1973 to 1987, 1947 IE alum Pete George maintained the Ramblin' Wreck at the Hapeville Ford Plant. George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors as well as a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech's 1985 centennial celebration. The car was completely disassembled, rebuilt, and repainted by late 1982. There were a few noticeable changes to the Ramblin' Wreck after the 1982 refurbishment. An aftermarket chrome stone guard was added to protect the grill, The emblems on the side were removed and replaced by a basic GT decal on the doors. The 1952 Yellow Jackets were moved to the front tire wells. The white horn was chromed over. The old tire cover was a shield with a football helmet wearing yellow jacket. This was replaced with a white generic naugahyde Ford tire cover. The blackwall tires and brakes were replaced with whitewall tires and modified brakes. The Ramblin' Wreck license plate was issued in 1958. The Wreck is Georgia Historical Vehicle#563. The Wreck experienced a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained the vehicle for so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon. = Post-centennial restoration and change of ownership = After Pete George's retirement in 1987, the upkeep of the Wreck fell directly upon the shoulders of the Wreck Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, the Wreck has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages. The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild. After 1994, Reck Club restored the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 that saw the car repainted and the engine rebuilt. Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the electrical generator with a more efficient Nu-Rex alternator. = 2007 highway accident = Reck Club coordinated their second major restoration following damage incurred during a highway accident on June 22, 2007, on Interstate 75 in Monroe County, about 60 miles south of Atlanta. Though trailered, the crash caused severe damage to the body and top of the Ramblin' Wreck, while the Ford Expedition and trailer in tow were both wrecked. Fourth-year Polymer, Textile, and Fiber Engineering major John Bird was driving, with his younger brother Matt, and recalled for the press: Bird had stated that both his brother and he got whiplash from the crash, one of Matt's legs was bruised, and \\"it also could have been a lot worse.\\" = Modern role of the Wreck = The Ramblin' Wreck has led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Grant Field almost 300 games. It also makes appearances for other Georgia Tech sports teams: it is often seen before big basketball games at Hank McCamish Pavilion, occasionally parked outside of Russ Chandler Stadium during warm weekend baseball series, and has attended several softball games a year at the new mid-campus stadium. A symbol of the Institute's academic and collegiate tradition, the old Model A is often dispatched to special events on campus. It is always present when new buildings are opened or dedicated. On December 5, 2006, the Wreck became the first car to drive across the new Fifth Street Bridge. Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, known as When the Whistle Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who died during the previous year. The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage. During Tech Homecoming, the Ramblin' Wreck has several duties. Several days before Homecoming, it acts as a giant gold starter pistol for the Mini 500 tricycle race. The Wreck's next task is to lead the racers out of the starting line in the Freshman Cake Race. On the day of the Homecoming football game, the Wreck leads the Ramblin' Wreck Parade, then leads the football team onto the field. The car is also present at every Freshman Orientation (FASET), Earth Day festival, and other campuswide events. A ride in the Wreck serves as a gift to many retiring faculty and staff; a ride onto Grant Field is one of the greatest honors Georgia Tech can bestow. Kim King, for example, received this honor on October 2, 2004, during halftime of the Miami game.  Wreck traditions and specifications  The Ramblin' Wreck's flags There are several lesser known details about the Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive. Specific physical details and the actual person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked. The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers. There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association. This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots. When a freshman first reaches campus for FASET (orientation), one of the many traditions that they are introduced to is that freshmen cannot touch the Wreck until the completion of their first year. This rule originated in the 1963 edition of the RAT Rules. If a freshman touches the Wreck between convocation and the last day of classes in the Spring, they will receive bad luck throughout their college career and GT will be cursed to lose to UGA in football that year. The Wreck is distinguished by its old gold body and white soft top. The soft top has a chrome support strut, which features a brass classic Tech T and 1952 yellow jacket. The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run the length of the vehicle. The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride. The interior upholstery is solid white vinyl. The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it. There are two golden nylon pennants emblazoned with the words \\"To Hell With Georgia\\" and \\"Give 'Em Hell Tech\\" fastened to the front bumper. = Driver = The Ramblin' Wreck radiator cap The driver of the Ramblin' Wreck is an elected position within Ramblin' Reck Club. This position is determined after every football season. The driver manages the car's public appearances and maintenance. There have only been 46 drivers of the Wreck, making the position of Wreck driver one of the most prestigious positions in all of Georgia Tech's student organizations. The driver gets to add their own personal touch every year to the Wreck. The front license plate is chosen by the driver every year and the radiator cap is replaced yearly, as well. The cap is typically a flying quail or a wreath. After each driver's term, the driver gets to keep the two pennants, too. Dean Dull initiated a group known as the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He was also the first person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964‚Äì1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit. Four women have officially driven the Ramblin' Wreck in its history. Lisa Volmar, an industrial engineering major, was elected the driver in 1984 and she was the first female driver after 23 consecutive years of male-only drivers. = Reck or Wreck = The name can be spelled either Ramblin Reck or Ramblin Wreck. In all spellings, there is no g in Ramblin. The first references to the 1930 Model A (1961) spelled the word Reck while the first references to the 1914 Model T owned by Dean Field spelled the word Reck (1925). Ramblin' Reck Club has spelled the word Reck since their 1945 club charter. The Institute has adopted the spelling Ramblin' Wreck and holds a trademark on the phrase. Reck Club still refers to the Ramblin' Wreck as the Ramblin' Reck while most other agencies refer to it as the Ramblin' Wreck.  Travelin' Wreck  In its history, the Wreck has appeared at a number of away games and other events away from the Georgia Tech campus. Many of these trips resulted in damage to the Reck or other interesting anecdotes. The first away game for the Ramblin' Wreck was the 1961 game against the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Wreck was freighted by Southern Railway to Birmingham, Alabama. At the time, Alabama played its home games at Legion Field. Before the game, the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to traverse the slope up to visit Birmingham's Vulcan statue. The trip to Birmingham was such a success, a trip to Jacksonville for Tech's Gator Bowl appearance against Penn State was organized, as well. These were the first road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career. In 1963, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee and Ramblin' Reck Club organized another road trip for the Wreck. This trip took the Wreck up to Knoxville for a game against the Tennessee Volunteers. After Tech won the game, the Wreck was stored overnight in Neyland Stadium. Administrators and Tennessee's Athletic Director Bob Woodruff promised Georgia Tech Athletics that the Wreck would be safe. They were wrong. Tennessee students broke into the storage area and painted the Wreck orange. They wrote \\"Go Vols\\" in the paint and covered the gold wheels with paint, as well. After the incident, Georgia Tech sent a bill to Tennessee's Athletic Department asking for restitution. Woodruff was believed to have aided the students in their efforts after he openly contested the officiating of the football contest. In 1976, Tech students took the Wreck to Athens for the annual football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car. The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it. The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol. The farthest trips the Ramblin' Wreck has ever traveled from Atlanta were the 1970 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, in 1990 for Tech's NCAA Final Four appearance against UNLV. The Wreck was freighted by van to Denver Coliseum. Along the way, a television crew documented the trip and broadcast the Wreck's expedition during the Final Four promotions. This banner was displayed before the Wreck's unveiling after the 2007 accident. Shown at the 2007 Georgia Tech vs Samford football game, it states that \\"Our Ford is better than Samford\\". The last major road trips for the Ramblin' Wreck were to the 2004 Final Four in San Antonio, the 2006 ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, Florida, and the 2009 ACC Championship Game in Tampa's Raymond James Stadium. The Wreck led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Alltel Stadium's field for Tech's first appearance in the ACC title game, as well as performing the same duty in their second appearance and first win in the ACC championship game in 2009. The Wreck has also been to the Orange Bowl, Gator Bowl, All-American Bowl, Sun Bowl, Peach Bowl, Citrus Bowl, and Champs Sports Bowl. On June 15, 2007, the Wreck was involved in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta in a covered car trailer. The trailer failed while carrying the Wreck, in turn causing the truck and trailer to run off the road and into the roadside ditch. The Wreck fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to its side and roof. Despite the severe body damage (in excess of $30,000), the Wreck was repaired for the first game of the 2007 season against the Samford Bulldogs.  In the media  In 1987, the Ramblin' Wreck and Dean Jim Dull were featured on ABC-TV's morning show. Dean Dull shouted into the camera, \\"I'm Dean of Students Jim Dull and I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech. Good Morning, America!\\" Dull was on the show because he had won a make-a-wish contest. All he wanted was for the Ramblin' Wreck, gold-clad students, and himself to be on the ABC morning show and ABC granted the wish. The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured in several newspapers, magazines, and books. The Ramblin' Wreck is portrayed leading the Georgia Tech football team onto the field on the cover of Al Thomy's 1973 work Ramblin' Wreck ‚Äì A Story of Georgia Tech Football. Pete George's 1982 refurbishment was featured in the November 1983 edition of the Ford Times. The June 1986 edition of Cars & Parts Magazine featured the Ramblin' Wreck and the raffle for the Centennial Wreck. The December 1991 Car Collector & Car Classics featured the Wreck on the cover after the National Championship season. The December 2007 Bellsouth Real White Pages for Greater Atlanta featured the Ramblin' Wreck with censored flags. The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured numerous times in Tech's student newspaper, The Technique, and Atlanta's primary newspaper, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution. The Wreck has also been featured in The New York Times and the Associated Press. Local newspapers such as the Cherokee Times, Augusta Chronicle, and Gwinnett Daily Post have also printed articles about the Wreck. In the week prior to the 2007 home opener, the Ramblin' Wreck was featured on ESPN First Take. ESPN showed old clips of the Wreck leading the football team onto the field and discussed the possibility of the Wreck not making the football opener after 45 consecutive years of never missing a game. The Ramblin' Wreck was featured prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money. Cramer exited the Wreck's passenger door to start the show and one of Cramer's trademark soundboards was attached to the front bumper. On April 16, 2009, a Georgia Tech student riding on the running board of the Ramblin' Wreck fell and suffered severe head injuries hospitalizing the student for four days. Almost a year later, the student filed suit against Georgia Tech and an auto shop responsible for installing handles on the roof of the car. The lawsuit cites the failure of the auto shop's handles as the reason for the fall and claims the University promoted the unsafe use of a vehicle by students. In September 2013, the student injured in the April 2009 accident, won a settlement of $1.36 million from the Georgia Board of Regents and Eco-Clean, Inc. The 2012 edition of EA Sports' NCAA football video game featured the addition of the Ramblin' Wreck leading Georgia Tech's football team onto the field at all games played in Bobby Dodd Stadium. The Ramblin' Wreck was included in the game alongside many other colleges' pre-game traditions to \\"deliver the pride and pageantry of game day\\".  Ramblin' replicas  The Alumni Association's \\"Alumni Reck\\", a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster The 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe shell in the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center Several vehicles claim \\"Ramblin' Wreck status.\\" However, only one car is the official Ramblin' Wreck, with no backups or equivalent vehicles. * The most famous of the fake Wrecks is a 1931 Ford Model A Cabriolet known as the Centennial Wreck. This vehicle was refurbished along with the real Wreck in 1985. The vehicle followed the Ramblin' Wreck onto the field all of the 1985 football season and was raffled for $250,000 by Pete George and Georgia Tech in 1986. * In 1988, the Alumni Association purchased a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster and restored the vehicle again in 1994. The Alumni Wreck is distinguished by its spare tire locations on the driver's side and passenger-side runningboards and the words \\"Georgia Tech Alumni Association\\" printed on the doors. It also has a convertible top. On the real Wreck, the spare is behind the rumble seat and the roof cannot be removed or lowered. *A 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe shell is kept in the Georgia Tech Hotel. This car has not worked since it has been on campus. The motor is incomplete and the front end lacks the Wreck's chrome stone guard. This is one of the few replicas that is almost identical in make, model, and paint scheme when compared to the real Ramblin' Wreck. * Also, several alumni-owned vehicles are painted to resemble the Wreck. These vehicles mimic the look and feel of the car, but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alumni attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials, who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta. * Several B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators and at least one F4U Corsair were designated the name Ramblin' Wreck during service in World War II. * The Chicago Brewing Company features an amber ale by the name of Ramblin' Wreck Amber Ale.

The fort has been controlled by a number of different rulers in its history. The present-day fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, Gujari Mahal and Man Mandir, built by Man Singh Tomar (reigned 1486‚Äì1516 CE).

The fort is built on an outcrop of Vindhyan sandstone on a solitary rocky hill called Gopachal. This feature is long, thin, and steep. The geology of the Gwalior range rock formations is ochre coloured sandstone covered with basalt. There is a horizontal stratum, at its highest point (length and average width ). The stratum forms a near-perpendicular precipice. A small river, the Swarnrekha, flows close to the palace.Oldham R. D. \\"A manual of the geology of India.\\" Cambridge University Press 2011. p. 65 Accessed at Google Books 30 November 2013.  History  Courtyard of Maan Mandir The exact period of Gwalior Fort's construction is not certain but according to some old records we get to know that Gwalior for was before known as Badal garh fort which was build by a Sakarwar Rajput king name as Maharaja Badal Dev. According to a local legend, the fort was built by a local king named Suraj Sen(Sakarwar Rajput) in 3 CE. He was cured of leprosy, when a sage named Gwalipa offered him the water from a sacred pond, which now lies within the fort. The grateful king constructed a fort, and named it after the sage. The sage bestowed the title Pal (\\"protector\\") upon the king, and told him that the fort would remain in his family's possession, as long as they bear this title. 83 descendants of Suraj Sen Pal controlled the fort, but the 84th, named Tej Karan, lost it. The inscriptions and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. A Gwalior inscription describes a sun temple built during the reign of the Huna emperor Mihirakula in 6th century. The Teli ka Mandir, now located within the fort, was built by the Gurjara-Pratiharas in the 9th century. The fort definitely existed by the 10th century, when it is first mentioned in the historical records. The Kachchhapaghatas controlled the fort at this time, most probably as feudatories of the Chandelas. From 11th century onwards, the Muslim dynasties attacked the fort several times. In 1022 CE, Mahmud of Ghazni besieged the fort for four days. According to Tabaqat-i-Akbari, he lifted the siege in return for a tribute of 35 elephants. The Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak, who later became a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, captured the fort in 1196 after a long siege. The Delhi Sultanate lost the fort for a short period before it was recaptured by Iltumish in 1232 CE. In 1398, the fort came under the control of the Tomars. The most distinguished of the Tomar rulers was Maan Singh, who commissioned several monuments within the fort. The Delhi Sultan Sikander Lodi tried to capture the fort in 1505 but was unsuccessful. Another attack, by his son Ibrahim Lodi in 1516, resulted in Maan Singh's death. The Tomars ultimately surrendered the fort to the Delhi Sultanate after a year- long siege. During the last part of Lodi dynasty the fort was under Maharaja Kamdev singh who was a Sakarwar Rajput king. After the defeat in Battle of Khanwa, Kamdev came to Ghazipur. Gwalior Fort was the base for many of Hemu's campaigns. Within a decade, the Mughal emperor Babur captured the fort from the Delhi Sultanate. The Mughals lost the fort to Sher Shah Suri in 1542. Afterwards, the fort was used by Hemu, the Hindu general and, later, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi, as his base for his many campaigns, but Babur's grandson Akbar recaptured it in 1558. Akbar made the fort a prison for political prisoners. For example, Abul-Kasim, son of Kamran and Akbar's first cousin was held and executed at the fort. The last Tomar king of Gwalior, Maharaja Ramshah Tanwar, who had then taken refuge in Mewar, put up a strong resistance against Akbar and joined Maharana Pratap, his son-in-law, at the Battle of Haldighati. He was martyred in the battle along with his three sons (which included Shalivahan Singh Tomar, the heir-apparent) Guru Hargobind, on 24 June 1606, at age 11, was crowned as the sixth Sikh Guru.Louis E. Fenech, Martyrdom in the Sikh Tradition, Oxford University Press, pages 118-121HS Singha (2009), Sikh Studies, Book 7, Hemkunt Press, , pages 18-19 At his succession ceremony, he put on two swords: one indicated his spiritual authority (piri) and the other, his temporal authority (miri).HS Syan (2013), Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century, IB Tauris, , pages 48-55 Because of the execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, Guru Hargobind from the very start was a dedicated enemy of the Mughal rule. He advised Sikhs to arm and fight. The death of his father at the hands of Jahangir prompted him to emphasise the military dimension of the Sikh community. Jahangir responded by jailing the 14 year old Guru Hargobind at Gwalior Fort in 1609, on the pretext that the fine imposed on Guru Arjan had not been paid by the Sikhs and Guru Hargobind. It is not clear as to how much time he spent as a prisoner. The year of his release appears to have been either 1611 or 1612, when Guru Hargobind was about 16 years old. Persian records, such as Dabistan i Mazahib suggest he was kept in jail for twelve years, including over 1617-1619 in Gwalior, after which he and his camp were kept under Muslim army's surveillance by Jahangir. According to Sikh tradition, Guru Hargobind was released from the bondage of prison on Diwali. This important event in Sikh history is now termed the Bandi Chhor Divas festival. Aurangzeb's brother, Murad and nephews Suleman and Sepher Shikoh were also executed at the fort. The killings took place in the Man Mandir palace.After the death of the Aurangzeb, the Rana chieftains of Gohad held the Gwalior Fort. In 1755-56 Marathas took over Gwalior fort by defeating Gohad King.Torton E. \\"A gazetteer of the territories under the government of the East-India company, and of the native states on the continent of India, Volume 2\\" W. H. Allen & Co. 1854. The Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde (Scindia) captured the fort from the Gohad Rana Chhatar Singh, but soon lost it to the British East India Company. On August 3, 1780, a Company force under Captains Popham and Bruce captured the fort in a nighttime raid, scaling the walls with 12 grenadiers and 30 sepoys. Both sides suffered fewer than 20 wounded total. In 1780, the British governor Warren Hastings restored the fort to the Ranas of Gohad. The Marathas recaptured the fort four years later, and this time the British did not intervene because the Ranas of Gohad had become hostile to them. Daulat Rao Sindhia lost the fort to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. There were frequent changes in the control of the fort between the Scindias and the British between 1808 and 1844. In January 1844, after the battle of Maharajpur, the fort was occupied by the Gwalior State of the Maratha Scindia family, as protectorate of the British government. During the 1857 uprising, around 6500 sepoys stationed at Gwalior rebelled against the Company rule, although the Company's vassal ruler Jayajirao Scindia remained loyal to the British. The British took control of the fort in June 1858. They rewarded Jayajirao with some territory but retained control of the Gwalior Fort. By 1886, the British were in complete control of India, and the fort no longer had any strategic importance to them. Therefore, they handed over the fort to the Scindia family. The Scindias continued to rule Gwalior until the independence of India in 1947, and built several monuments including the Jai Vilas Mahal.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHaBw1EDrk Structures Rock cut images of the Tirthankaras. The fort and its premises are well maintained and house many historic monuments including palaces, temples and water tanks. There are also a number of palaces (mahal) including the Man mandir, the Gujari, the Jahangir, the Karan, and the Shah Jahan.\\"Temples of Gwalior\\" Kamat's Potpourri Webpage. Accessed 1 December 2013. The fort covers an area of and rises . Its rampart is built around the edge of the hill, connected by six bastions or towers. The profile of the fort has an irregular appearance due to the undulating ground beneath. There are two gates; one on the northeast side with a long access ramp and the other on the southwest. The main entrance is the ornate Elephant gate (Hathi Pul). The other is the Badalgarh Gate. The Man Mandir palace or citadel is located at the northeast end of the fort. It was built in the 15th century and refurbished in 1648. The water tanks or reservoirs of the fort could provide water to a 15,000 strong garrison, the number required to secure the fort. =Major Monuments=  Jain temples  Siddhachal Jain Temple Caves were built in 7th to 15th century. There are eleven Jain temples inside Gwalior fort dedicated to the Jain Tirthankaras. On the southern side are 21 temples cut into the rock with intricately carved of the tirthankaras. Tallest Idol is image of Rishabhanatha or Adinatha, the 1st Tirthankara, is high.Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pp. 364‚Äì370Gwalior Fort, Archaeological Survey of India, Bhopal Circle, India (2014) Main Temple Urvahi Jain statues carved out of rock in the Gwalior Fort near the Urwai Gate The entire area of Gwalior fort is divided into five groups namely Urvahi, North West, North East, South West and the South East areas. In the Urvahi area 24 idols of Tirthankar in the padmasana posture, 40 in the kayotsarga posture and around 840 idols carved on the walls and pillars are present. The largest idol is a 58 feet 4 inches high idol of Adinatha outside the Urvahi gate and a 35 feet high idol of Suparshvanatha in the Padmasana in Paththar-ki bavadi (stone tank) area.Jain Samaj Gopachal 58 feet 4 inches high idol of Bhagwan Adinatha. There are around 1500 idols on the Gopachal Hill, which includes the size from 6 inch to 57 feet in height. All the idols are carved by cutting the hilly rocks (rock carving) and are very artistic. Most of the idols were built in 1341‚Äì1479, during the period of King Dungar Singh and Keerti Singh of Tomar dynasty. Here is a very beautiful and miraculous colossus of Bhagwan Parsvanath in padmasan posture 42 feet in height & 30 feet in breadth. It is said that in 1527, Mughal emperor Babar after occupying the fort ordered his soldiers to break the idols, when soldiers stroked on the thumb, a miracle was seen and invaders were compelled to run away. In the period of Mughals the idols were destroyed, broken fragments of those idols are spread here and there in the fort. Main colossus of this Kshetra is Parsvanatha's, 42 feet high and 30 feet wide. Together with the place of precept by Bhagwan Parsvanath. This is also the place where Shri 1008 Supratishtha Kevali attained niravana. There are 26 Jain Temples more on this hill.Jain.org.in Mughal Invasion : In 1527, Babar army attacked Gwalior Fort and de-faced these statues. In spite of invasion the early Jaina sculptures of Gwalior have survived in fairly good condition so that their former splendour is not lost. Teli ka mandir Teli ka Mandir was built by the Pratihara emperor Mihira Bhoja. The Teli ka Mandir is a Hindu temple built by the Pratihara emperor Mihira Bhoja. It is the oldest part of the fort and has a blend of south and north Indian architectural styles. Within the rectangular structure is a shrine with no pillared pavilions (mandapa) and a South Indian barrel- vaulted roof on top. It has a masonry tower in the North Indian Nagari architectural style with a barrel vaulted roof in height. The niches in the outer walls once housed statues but now have chandrashalas (horseshoe arches) ventilator openings in the north Indian style. The chandrashala has been compared to the trefoil, a honeycomb design with a series of receding pointed arches within an arch. The entrance door has a torana or archway with sculpted images of river goddesses, romantic couples, foliation decoration and a Garuda. The vertical bands on either side of the door are decorated in a simple fashion with figures that are now badly damaged. Above the door are a small grouping of discs representing the finial (damalaka) of a Shikhara. The temple was originally dedicated to Vishnu, destroyed during a Muslim invasion, restored into a Shiva temple by installing a linga while keeping the Vaishnava motifs such as the Garuda .Allen M. P. \\"Ornament in Indian architecture.\\" University of Delaware Press 1991. .ASI Report: Gwalior, A Cunningham, pp. 356‚Äì359 It was refurbished between 1881 and 1883. Garuda monument Close to the Teli ka Mandir temple is the Garuda monument, dedicated to Vishnu, is the highest in the fort. It has a mixture of Muslim and Indian architecture. The word Teli comes from the hindi word meaning oil. Sahastrabahu (Sas-Bahu) temple The Sas-Bahu Temple was built in 1092-93 by the Kachchhapaghata dynasty.

Etymology The name Beypazarƒ± means The Bey's market in Turkish, as in the Ottoman period this was an important military base and the cavalry stationed here were an important element of the local economy. History The area has a long history of occupation by Hittites, Phrygians, Ancient Romans, Byzantines, Seljuk Turks and the Ottoman Empire. Beypazarƒ± was known as Lagania (), meaning 'rocky peak' in the Luwian language during the Roman and Byzantine times, and the town was a regional administrative center. Like most Luwian cities located in West Anatolia, Lagania supported the Trojans during the famous Trojan war. Lagania belonged to Tectosagae in the region of Galatia, which was occupied early in the 3rd century BC by Celtic tribes. The Gallic region was later (189 BC) subjected by the Romans. It became a Roman province in 25 BC, and was split into two provinces, Galatia Prima and Galatia Secunda, in the 390s. Lagania was in the province of Galatia Prima, and received the name Anastasiopolis () during the reign of Emperor Anastasius I () after he had visited the city and liked it so much. The town was also an episcopal see, suffragan of the Metropolis of Ancyra (modern Ankara), mentioned by the up to the 12th and 13th centuries. No longer a residential bishopric, Lagania remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.Catholic Hierarchy The town was conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the 12th century and was settled by various lords of the Oghuz Turks, eventually becoming part of the Ottoman Empire.

Including T√°chira, TRT can be seen in the southern part of the Zulia, northeastern Barinas, and northern Apure in Venezuela. Its signal can also be seen in Colombia in the Norte de Santander Department and northern Arauca Department. It broadcasts on channel six. History In early 1983, a group of businessmen from T√°chira came up with the idea to establish a television network in T√°chira with the purpose of promoting the region‚Äôs culture. Later, other businessmen from other areas in Venezuela became involved. The company Televisora Regional del T√°chira, S.A., was established in March 1984 and on February 17, 1988, the company received a broadcast license from the Venezuelan Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Ministerio de Transporte y Comunicaciones). In early 1989, the construction of the transmitting station located on a hill named \\"Gallinero\\" in Palmira, Gu√°simos municipality, was completed. This transmitting station enabled TRT to finally go on the air. TRT's signal reaches most of T√°chira, parts of Apure, parts of Zulia, the northern part of the Arauca Department in Colombia, and some parts of the Norte de Santander Department in Colombia. On July 24, 1989, TRT began testing their signal on channel six. Its test signal consisted of a color test pattern and the network's music. On October 15, 1989, at 8pm, a soccer (football) game was broadcast from the Polideportivo de Pueblo Nuevo stadium in the city of San Crist√≥bal. It was on Friday, November 24, 1989, that the inaugural ball was celebrated in San Crist√≥bal‚Äôs opera house (important Venezuelan personalities came to this ball, including president Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez). This was when TRT began its regular programming. With the need to improve their coverage, another transmitting station (called \\"El Rayo\\", located in the municipality of Pedro Mar√≠a Ure√±a in T√°chira), was constructed, and finally became functional on March 25, 1994. This new transmitting station completely covered the Norte de Santander Department in Colombia, the southern part of Zulia, the Zamora municipality in Barinas, the P√°ez Municipality in Apure, and improved its signal in T√°chira.www.trt-tv.com Programming You can see TRT's programming chart for this week at: https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090751/http://www.televisoradeltachira.com/contenido/programacion/adjuntar/programacion.jpg.

It is based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss and is the first feature-length film version of the story. Plot In London in 1813, a Swiss father, William Robinson, wishes to escape the influence of the superficial profligacy of London on his family. His eldest son, Fritz, is obsessed with Napoleon, whom he considers his hero. His middle son, Jack, is a foolish dandy who cares only about fashion and money. And his dreamy son Ernest is preoccupied with reading and writing to the exclusion of all else. William Robinson sells his business and house, in order to move with his wife and four sons to Australia. They set out on a brig bound for the faraway country. Following a long voyage, the family is shipwrecked on a remote deserted island after the captain and crew are washed overboard during a storm. The family members collaborate to create a home for themselves in the alien jungle environment. They gradually learn to use the unfamiliar plants and animals to create what they need to live and thrive. They have many adventures and challenges and make many discoveries. The mother, however, misses her elegant home and community in England, and wishes to somehow be rescued and return. The father slowly convinces her that living in the natural environment is better for the family and that they are meant to be there. In the end, Fritz and Jack board a ship home while the rest of the family stay on the island. Cast Production notes The producers specialised in making films based on public domain texts. Tim Holt was the first star assigned. Freddie Bartholomew and Terry Kilburn were borrowed from MGM.Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p145 This was the first feature-length film with a performance by Orson Welles, who went uncredited as the story's narrator. A version running 108 minutes (15 minutes longer than the generally available print) is also screened occasionally. Critical reception =Upon release= The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Special Effects (Vernon L. Walker, John O. Aalberg).Turner Classic Movies, Swiss Family Robinson, Notes Frank Nugent of The New York Times wrote: :When it stays with the book, which was adventure plus instruction, the film is considerably better. The storm sequences‚Äîthere are three of them‚Äîare properly noisy, drenching and spectacular. The salvage trips to the reef-bound brig, the lessons in candlemaking and ostrich-taking, the recipe for Mrs. Robinson's fish stew, some of the family's minor naturalistic adventures are amusingly, and often excitingly, depicted. They and the uniformly competent performance of the cast make it a moderately entertaining, if rather somnolently paced, story-book film.The Screen: On a Tropic, Slightly Toporific, Isle Lands Wyss's 'Swiss Family Robinson' at the Music Hall, By Frank S. Nugent, The New York Times, February 9, 1940 Variety called it \\"a good adventure yarn\\" but suggested that the tropical storm sequences went on too long, and that Edna Best's hairdo seemed \\"always too perfect\\" for a believable castaway. Film Daily called it \\"an appealing picture for the family trade\\" and \\"a genuine accomplishment.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"Pretty good entertainment ... adapted with imagination and produced with skill.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote a mixed review, criticizing the change of the character of the mother from resourceful in the book to \\"fretful\\" and \\"discontented\\" in the film, a mood that \\"pervades the story and saps the vigor of the adventure element.\\" However, Mosher thought that \\"Some pleasant domestic animals and a pet or two add variety\\", and he found the tropical storm \\"satisfactory.\\" The movie recorded a loss of $180,000. =Contemporary critics= Leonard Maltin calls the 93-minute version an \\"Excellent adaptation of [the] Johann Wyss book\\", and writes that it \\"boasts impressive special effects, strong performances, and much darker elements than the Disney film Swiss Family Robinson\\".Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide, 2001 Edition, pg. 1372. Signet, The film is one of Oscar-winning film director James Ivory's favorite movies.

According to a July 1959 Los Angeles Times article, director Ken Annakin used the RKO adaptation as \\"an example of what not to do\\", that is, avoiding the 1940 film's soundstage reproductions and focusing instead on location shooting and realistic art direction.

(German An Meine V√∂lker!, Hungarian N√©peimhez!, Czech M√Ωm n√°rod≈Øm!, Slovenian Mojim narodom!, Italian Ai miei popoli!) was a manifesto signed by Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria- Hungary in Bad Ischl on July 28, 1914. The text announced the declaration of war on Serbia, starting World War I. \\"To my people\\" was a typical headline of war manifestoes; it was used in the declaration of war on Prussia in 1866 and in the announcement of the Italian entry into World War I (against Austria- Hungary) in 1915. Because Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic empire, 'people' was made plural. After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, diplomatic relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia became strained. After weeks of discussions, government and army leaders of the Empire decided to risk war with Serbia, hoping for a short and victorious campaign. Emperor Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war in his Imperial Villa in Bad Ischl on July 28. The document was distributed all over the empire and was widely published on the morning of the next day. At this time, several European countries had already started to mobilize their armies. The text presents the aggressiveness of Serbia as the reason for the war, claiming that the Empire had tried all the ways to avoid the conflict. The document was signed by Franz Joseph and Karl von St√ºrgkh, minister-president of Austria. The belief of some that a peaceful solution could be still reached was quickly dashed - all political parties, including the Social Democrats, expressed their support for the war. On July 29, Belgrade was bombed for the first time. On July 31, Austria-Hungary announced a general mobilization and, on August 12, the invasion of Serbia started. Other European powers entered World War I in early August. English translation The Imperial Rescript and Manifesto. Ischl, July 28. Dear Count St√ºrgkh: I have resolved to instruct the Ministers of my Household and Foreign Affairs to notify the Royal Serbian Government of the beginning of a state of war between the Monarchy and Serbia. In this fateful hour I feel the need of turning to my beloved peoples. I command you, therefore, to publish the inclosed manifesto. MANIFESTO. To my peoples! It was my fervent wish to consecrate the years which, by the grace of God, still remain to me, to the works of peace and to protect my peoples from the heavy sacrifices and burdens of war. Providence, in its wisdom, has otherwise decreed. The intrigues of a malevolent opponent compel me, in the defense of the honor of my Monarchy, for the protection of its dignity and its position as a power, for the security of its possessions, to grasp the sword after long years of peace. With a quickly forgetful ingratitude, the Kingdom of Serbia, which, from the first beginnings of its independence as a State until quite recently, had been supported and assisted by my ancestors, has for years trodden the path of open hostility to Austria-Hungary. When, after three decades of fruitful work for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I extended my Sovereign rights to those lands, my decree called forth in the Kingdom of Serbia, whose rights were in nowise injured, outbreaks of unrestrained passion and the bitterest hate. My Government at that time employed the handsome privileges of the stronger, and with extreme consideration and leniency only requested Serbia to reduce her army to a peace footing and to promise that, for the future, she would tread the path of peace and friendship. Guided by the same spirit of moderation, my Government, when Serbia, two years ago, was embroiled in a struggle with the Turkish Empire, restricted its action to the defense of the most serious and vital interests of the Monarchy. It was to this attitude that Serbia primarily owed the attainment of the objects of that war. The hope that the Serbian Kingdom would appreciate the patience and love of peace of my Government and would keep its word has not been fulfilled. The flame of its hatred for myself and my house has blazed always higher; the design to tear from us by force inseparable portions of Austria-Hungary has been made manifest with less and less disguise. A criminal propaganda has extended over the frontier with the object of destroying the foundations of State order in the southeastern part of the monarchy; of making the people, to whom I, in my paternal affection, extended my full confidence, waver in its loyalty to the ruling house and to the Fatherland; of leading astray its growing youth and inciting it to mischievous deeds of madness and high treason. A series of murderous attacks, an organized, carefully prepared, and well carried out conspiracy, whose fruitful success wounded me and my loyal peoples to the heart, forms a visible bloody track of those secret machinations which were operated and directed in Serbia. A halt must be called to these intolerable proceedings and an end must be put to the incessant provocations of Serbia. The honor and dignity of my monarchy must be preserved unimpaired, and its political, economic, and military development must be guarded from these continual shocks. In vain did my Government make a last attempt to accomplish this object by peaceful means and to induce Serbia, by means of a serious warning, to desist. Serbia has rejected the just and moderate demands of my Government and refused to conform to those obligations the fulfillment of which forms the natural and necessary foundation of peace in the life of peoples and States. I must therefore proceed by force of arms to secure those indispensable pledges which alone can insure tranquillity to my States within and lasting peace without. In this solemn hour I am fully conscious of the whole significance of my resolve and my responsibility before the Almighty. I have examined and weighed everything, and with a serene conscience I set out on the path to which my duty points. I trust in my peoples, who, throughout every storm, have always rallied in unity and loyalty around my throne, and have always been prepared for the severest sacrifices for the honor, the greatness, and the might of the Fatherland. I trust in Austria-Hungary's brave and devoted forces, and I trust in the Almighty to give the victory to my arms.

It is situated on the Ostsee coast, approx. 17 km northeast of the state capital Kiel, and 26 km north of Pl√∂n. The formerly unincorporated town, became a part of the Probstei district on January 1, 2008, which already had its seat in Sch√∂nberg. Sch√∂nberg, Neusch√∂nberg, Sch√∂nberger Strand, Brasilien (meaning Brazil), Kalifornien and Holm lie in the municipality. The names Brasilien and Kalifornien go back to the traditional names of the beaches. The name Kalifornien arose because of a piece of a ship which washed up on the shore, bearing the name \\"Kalifornien\\". History Earlier Sch√∂nberg was called Sconeberg, which means beautiful hill. In 1226 the Count of Schauenberg Adolf IV gave the northern part of the modern-day district of Pl√∂n to the cloister of the Benedictian Order in Preetz. This area was named Probstei, because it was under the administration of the provost of the cloister (in German: Propst). Between 1245 and 1250, the Provost of the cloister, Friedrich, grounded the town Sconeberg. Before that, there was most likely Slavic settlers. A large part of the inhabitants of the village were farm hands. It was characteristic of the Probstei Farmers that they were free men, and not feudal serfs; they only needed to pay tributes to the cloister. The town was protected by a palisade wall. There were two gates, to the south, in the direction of Preetz, was the \\"H√∂hndorfer Gate\\" and to the east, in the direction of Feldmark the \\"Stakendorfer Gate\\". The first sacred building in the town was Saint George's Chapel (built in 1220), west of Wisch, Pl√∂n. The chapel was destroyed during a storm which caused coastal flooding. The baptismal fond of the chapel is now located in the tower of the evangelical church. In 1600, the number of inhabitants was between 350 and 400. On February 10, 1625 a coastal flooding raged over Probstei. This was devastating for the inhabitants, because, at the time, there were no levees on the beach. In the night from August 2 to 3 in 1779, A large part of the village was consumed by fire, including the Lutheran church, which was probably made of wood. The reconstruction was able to begin fairly rapidly thanks to donations from the Barsbek farmers. The barocke church which stands there today was dedicated on September 22, 1782. The leading architect was the Official construction master in the Lands of Kiel, Johann Adam Richter, a student of Ernst Georg Sonnin (an important architect and engineer from Hamburg). The Sch√∂nberg Church was his Journeyman's piece, and the church in Kappeln was his masterpiece. The similarities of the two churches are very obvious, among other things the similarities between the two facades. As a thank you for the support of the Barsbek Farmers, a perch (the symbol of Barsbek) was used as a weather vane rather than the usual rooster. A storm in 1872 caused so much damage that a solid dike was installed from 1880 to 1882.

Location and Transport  Sch√∂nkirchen is located close to Kiel at the Bundesstra√üe 502 connecting Kiel and Sch√∂nberg (Holstein) and at the Kiel- Sch√∂nberg-Railroad. The closest main line train station is Kiel Central. Although Sch√∂nkirchen has access to the Schwentine river, passenger traffic (to Gothenburg and Oslo) and freight transport have to use the port of Kiel.  History  After the Wendish Crusade the German colonisation arrived in the Sch√∂nkirchen area in the early 13th century. The village was first mentioned in a 1294 deed, the Codex Cismariensis.[for the whole of the \\"history\\" part see Prien, Brigitte, Vorreiter Hanns, Waldner, J√ºrgen H. (editors): \\"Chronik 700 Jahre Sch√∂nkirchen\\"; Kiel; Howaldtsche Buchdruckerei, 1993, pp. 24 (German)] Count John II had been the patron of the local church and the surrounding village, but was forced to assign the village in a deed of separation of 7 February 1316 to his Grand-nephew John III. After this Sch√∂nkirchen was allodial title property of the counts of Kiel and the villagers had to pay their duties to the Kiel castle. Later on the village became a leasehold estate leased out to a succession of noble lessees. In 1356 Sch√∂nkirchen was sold to the Kiel Heiligengeist monastery (monastery of the Holy Spirit) and remained in its possession for the next 200 years. The administration including the patrimonial jurisdiction of the monastery's villages was held by the city council of Kiel, which was obliged to use the income for the almshouses and infirmaries associated with the monastery and for other godly purposes. Since the city council failed to fulfil these obligations properly complaints to the city and the duke got frequent over the years. Following the death of king Frederick I of Denmark several partitions of Schleswig-Holstein occurred - in the one of 9 August 1544 Kiel and its surrounding villages were ceded to the dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf, but duke Adolf I could make the Kiel city council comply with the distribution rules for the income derived from Sch√∂nkirchen only after an intervention of emperor Maximilian II.. After this the village had to pay its duties to the city of Kiel until the 18th century - at last the annual contribution amounted to 10 Reichsthaler and 45 Schillings payable to the Kiel St. Niclas' Church as well as wood for the schools and the organists in Kiel. Sch√∂nkirchen was a poor village with poor soil conditions, so that the local trade remained as small as the local peasants. Better to cope with the damages of frequent fires the Fire- and Church Guild of 1560 for mutual assistance and support amongst the villagers was founded. Together with the rest of Schleswig-Holstein- Gottorf the village fell under frequent change of rule. After being resigned by empress Catherine II of Russia to Denmark at the end of the 18th century Holstein came under joint austro-prussian administration after the Second Schleswig War in 1864 until both powers abandoned this condominium in the Gastein Convention and the Austrian Empire got sole control of Holstein in 1865. But in 1866 Austria lost the Austro-Prussian War and had to surrender its Holstein possessions to the Kingdom of Prussia that merged its duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to the prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. The neighboring Kiel in 1867 was declared Baltic Naval Station of the North German Confederation and later of the German Empire in 1871. This resulted in the set up of businesses like the Imperial Shipyard Kiel and its ancillary and supply industries, e.g. foundries, dockyards and other defence industries. The factories' demand for workers led to a rapid increase in population in the city of Kiel but also in the villages in its vicinity such as Sch√∂nkirchen. During World War I the workers had to perform extra shifts at the shipyards without receiving extra food rations. The women, children and the aged at the homesteads had a lot of trouble to till the fields and reap the harvests. 64 men from Sch√∂nkirchen died in the hostilities at the front. In the years of the Weimar Republic the villagers had to endure the 1920s German inflation and the Great Depression at the end of the decade. Just as in other parts of Schleswig-Holstein the promises of the NSDAP could attract voters at an early stage of its rise to power. Shortly after Adolf Hitler seized power on 31 January 1933 the factories in Kiel started to produce arms again quickly and were in need of workers. The defence companies also put up industrial residential centres for its workforce in Sch√∂nkirchen such as the Ansch√ºtzwerke (Ansch√ºtzsiedlung) or Deutsche Werke shipyards (Kalkstein, Kemmecken). As the military industry changed into higher gear before World War II several workers camps were set up in Sch√∂nkirchen for the various defence companies such as Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Feinmechanische Werke and other military suppliers. At the beginning these camps were inhabited by Reichsarbeitsdienst members but after the start of World War II increasingly foreign workers (Fremdarbeiter) were placed in there. To defend nearby Kiel and its military industry some anti-aircraft units were installed on the municipal territory. Nonetheless several airstrikes caused heavy civilian collateral damage in Sch√∂nkirchen, too. After the war many refugees, bombed out and displaced persons sought accommodation. At first the former workers camps were used until residential buildings were completed in the village (Brammerkamp, Augustental/Sch√∂nberger Landstra√üe, Haferberg). To prevent Sch√∂nkirchen to become a sheer dormitory village - in 1951 70% of all the resident working inhabitants did so at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyard - in 1967 the development of S√∂hren business park started.

His speciality was boxing. He was presenter of programmes such as Sportsnight (1975‚Äì1985) and Grandstand and also anchored coverage of Wimbledon and golf tournaments.  Early life and early career  Carpenter was the son of a wholesale fish merchant at Billingsgate Market and was born at South Norwood in South London. He attended Selhurst Grammar School in Surrey. During World War II he served as a telegrapher in the Royal Navy. Upon leaving the Navy after the end of World War 2, he started his journalism career in 1946. He began sports reporting as a sub-editor for several national newspapers. Career He joined the BBC in 1949 and was the corporation's full-time boxing correspondent from 1962 until his retirement in 1994, when Jim Neilly replaced him in that capacity. He served as a boxing columnist for the Sporting Record from 1950 to 1954. He then worked for the Daily Mail as a boxing writer and sports columnist from 1954 to 1962. While writing for the national papers, Carpenter broadcast regularly on radio and television, covering thousands of professional and amateur fights including all Olympic Games from 1956 until 1992. He wrote three books about boxing, produced the documentary, The Richest Prize in Sport, and served as the voice of the Hall of Fame series, Sports Archive and Great Moments in Sport. Carpenter described the end of the historic boxing fight between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in Zaire, in 1974, a fight which became known as \\"The Rumble in the Jungle\\", as \\"the most extraordinary few seconds that I have ever seen in a boxing ring\\". While occasionally given to raising his voice, as he did when Ali knocked out Foreman or when Barry McGuigan floored Eusebio Pedroza in 1985, Carpenter was widely regarded as unflappable and a great professional. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the fight between \\"Marvelous\\" Marvin Hagler and Alan Minter at the Empire Pool in 1980: after Hagler stopped Minter in the third round, the crowd, some of them fuelled by drink and hatred (Minter had previously said \\"no black man will take my title\\"), expressed their displeasure by hurling beer cans and bottles into the ring. While other members of the press hid under their chairs or protected themselves with typewriters, Carpenter continued to broadcast what he called \\"a shame and a disgrace to British boxing\\", even after he was struck several times with missiles. Carpenter's rapport with former WBC World Heavyweight Champion Frank Bruno was well known. Carpenter often conducted post-match interviews with Bruno, whose catchphrase was \\"know what I mean, 'Arry?\\". Bruno's agent later stated that Bruno saw Carpenter as a \\"real friend.\\" Over his career, which spanned across decades, Carpenter was recognised as \\"The Voice of Boxing.\\" While his name was most often associated with boxing, Carpenter established himself as one of Britain's most versatile sportscasters, covering many of the major sporting events. He was a presenter of Sportsnight between 1975 and 1985 and a regular member of the broadcast team on Grandstand. He covered all major golf tournaments from 1965 until his retirement. He also served as commentator on the Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race, and greyhound racing. He anchored Wimbledon for the BBC from 1967 until 1993. His connection with greyhound racing began when he was a journalist for a national publication called the Greyhound Owner. He later commentated on the annual BBC Television Trophy shown on Sportsnight. Honours and recognition Carpenter was appointed OBE in the 1991 New Year Honours.Obituary in The Times 23 March 2010 He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1991 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Royal Oak, Canning Town, London. Death Carpenter died in his sleep at King's College Hospital in South London in the early hours of Saturday morning, 20 March 2010, aged 84. He had been unwell since the summer of 2009 when he had a minor heart attack.

The film stars John Huston, Bob Random, Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg and Oja Kodar. Shooting began in 1970 for what Welles intended to be his Hollywood comeback, and resumed on-and-off until 1976. Welles continued to intermittently work on the project into the 1980s, but it became embroiled in legal, financial, and political complications which prevented it from being completed. The story utilized a film-within-a-film narrative which follows the last day in the life of an aging Hollywood film director (Huston) as he hosts a screening party for his unfinished latest project. The film was shot in an unconventional mockumentary style featuring a rapid cutting approach with both color and black-and-white footage. It was intended as a satire of both the passing of Classic Hollywood and of the avant-garde filmmakers of Europe and New Hollywood in the 1970s. The unreleased results would be called \\"the Holy Grail of cinema\\". It holds the record for the longest production time in history ‚Äî 48 years. Despite Welles' death in 1985, filming was completed and several attempts were made at reconstructing the unfinished film. In 2014, the rights were acquired by Royal Road and the project was overseen by Bogdanovich and producer Frank Marshall. The Other Side of the Wind had its world premiere at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2018, and was released on November 2, 2018, by Netflix to critical praise, accompanied by a documentary They'll Love Me When I'm Dead. Plot The film opens by describing the final day of Jake Hannaford, an aging Hollywood director who was killed in a car crash on his 70th birthday, with narration from an elderly Brooks Otterlake, who had been a prot√©g√© of Hannaford's. Just before his death, Hannaford was trying to revive his waning career by making a flashy film, laden with gratuitous sex scenes and violence, with mixed results. At the time of Hannaford's party, this film (titled The Other Side of the Wind) has been left unfinished after its star stormed off the set, for reasons not immediately apparent to the audience. A screening of some incomprehensible parts of Hannaford's unfinished experimental film takes place, in order to attract \\"end money\\" from studio boss Max David. Hannaford himself is absent, and a loyal member of his entourage, the former child star Billy Boyle, makes an inept attempt to describe what the film is about. Intercut during this, we see various groups setting out for Hannaford's seventieth birthday party at an Arizona ranch. Hannaford arrives with a young Brooks Otterlake, a commercially successful director with a talent for mimicking celebrities, who credits much of his success to his close study of Hannaford. Many journalists attending the party brandish cameras, and shoot out invasive questions, eventually querying Hannaford's sexuality and whether he has long been a closeted homosexual, in spite of his macho public persona. Hannaford has a history of seducing the wife or girlfriend of each of his leading men, but maintains a strong attraction to the leading men themselves. Several party guests comment on the conspicuous absence of John Dale, Hannaford's leading man in his latest film, whom Hannaford first discovered when Dale was attempting suicide by jumping into the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican coast. As the party proceeds, Hannaford finds out that Dale's suicide attempt had been faked, and that he had actually set off to Mexico to find Hannaford. Meanwhile, guests are shown more scenes from the film at the ranch's private cinema. One scene makes it clear why Dale left the film ‚Äì he stormed off the set in anger, in the middle of a sex scene in which he was being goaded by Hannaford off-screen. As the party continues, Hannaford gets progressively drunker. He is washing his face in the bathroom when he breaks down in front of Otterlake, asking for the young director's help to revive his career. A series of power outages in the middle of Hannaford's party interrupts the screening. The party continues by lantern- light, and eventually reconvenes to an empty drive-in cinema, where the last portion of Hannaford's film is screened. Having realized at the party that Otterlake is not going to financially support Hannaford's new film, the two have a mournful last exchange in the drive-in theatre, realising that their friendship is at an end. Intrusive journalist Juliette Rich has asked Hannaford the most explicit questions of all about his sexuality. At this moment, Hannaford slaps Rich in drunken outrage, while a drunken Billy Boyle mounts an impassioned defense of the director. As dawn breaks at the ranch, Dale is walking around the mostly empty house, having only just arrived the morning after. He finally arrives at the drive-in just as a drunken Hannaford is leaving and asks him to get in the sports car with him, but Dale does not. Hannaford drives away, leading to his fatal car accident. Meanwhile, Hannaford's symbolic film finishes screening to a now-almost-empty drive-in theatre. The only person still watching is the actress who starred in it. She watches the final scene, and drives off as Hannaford's closing narration says: ::\\"Who knows? Maybe you can stare too hard at something, huh? Drain out the virtue, suck out the living juice. You shoot the great places and the pretty people, all those girls and boys ‚Äì shoot 'em dead.\\" =Plot of the film- within-a-film= Hannaford's experimental film-within-a-film, shot as a spoof of European arthouse cinema typified by Antonioni, and performed without any dialogue, is visually striking, but has very little narrative coherence. The following scenes are shown, in this order: *A graphic lesbian steamroom scene, rapidly intercut, featuring Oja Kodar, which Hannaford is in the process of filming at the start. *Several expressionistically shot chase scenes between Oja Kodar and Bob Random amid the skyscrapers of Century City, Los Angeles, with various optical illusions, in which it is not immediately apparent whose character is chasing whom. At the end of these scenes, he buys a doll for her, and she rebuffs him, driving off into the night with her boyfriend. *The two characters meet again in a nightclub. She steps out into the toilets, where various hippies are engaged in various sex acts, and changes her clothes, before coming back in again. He gives her the doll. She produces a pair of scissors, rapidly cutting the doll's hair, then cutting out its eyes. *They step out from the nightclub into her boyfriend's 1968 Ford Mustang fastback. The car takes off in the rainy night, and as the boyfriend drives, the pair have sex in the passenger seat next to him. After a few minutes the boyfriend stops the car, grabs the girl off of Dale, and appears to make an attempt to engage her for himself. She rebukes him and the pair is then tossed out. John Dale, with his pants halfway down, lands in a large puddle. *The next morning arrives and Kodar's totally naked character has found shelter in the second story of a house. From there, she climbs carefully out of an open window, drops to the ground, and wanders to an empty railroad car, where she finds Dale asleep on the floor. More chase scenes with optical illusions ensue, around the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios back-lot (including Kodar's character going into Andy Hardy's iconic house). *There is then a sex scene on raw bedsprings left on the studio back-lot, Off screen you can hear Hannaford giving Dale direction, and after some awkward badgering, a naked John Dale decides he's had enough and leaves the set. Hannaford watches him go and calls out through the megaphone ...\\"goodbye Johnny Dale.\\" The production is now without a leading man. *There is then a scene ‚Äì which Hannaford's manager 'The Baron' complains is presented out of sequence ‚Äì in which a now-clothed John Dale walks alone around a dusty, windy studio back-lot. *The final scene features a nude Oja Kodar attacking a giant phallic symbol with a pair of scissors, and it deflating and collapsing in front of her. Cast * John Huston as J.J. \\"Jake\\" Hannaford, modelled on Ernest Hemingway. Welles denied speculation that the character was also based on himself or Huston, although he noted that there were elements of early Hollywood directors with macho reputations, such as Rex Ingram, John Ford, Raoul Walsh and William A. Wellman. * Oja Kodar as The Actress or The Red, Red Indian, nicknamed Pocahontas by Hannaford. The unnamed, enigmatic actress features prominently in the film-within-a-film. She also attends Hannaford's party, bridging the two parts of the film. Her role is entirely silent. * Peter Bogdanovich as Brooks Otterlake, a prot√©g√© of Hannaford's who is now a commercially successful director in his own right, and who has a talent for mimicking celebrities. The character has many parallels with Bogdanovich himself, who took over the role after the departure of comedian Rich Little. Little remained credited as a party extra. * Susan Strasberg as Juliette Rich, a savage film critic. The character was a thinly veiled spoof of Pauline Kael, with whom Welles was in a public feud over her controversial allegation in the essay \\"Raising Kane\\" that he did not write Citizen Kane. The role had originally been written with Jeanne Moreau in mind, and was initially played by Bogdanovich's then-wife Polly Platt, who also served as the film's production designer, before eventually being taken over by Strasberg, who reshot the scenes previously filmed with Platt. * Norman Foster as Billy Boyle, an aging former child actor from Hannaford's early films, and a member of his entourage, portrayed as a stooge. He is a recovering alcoholic, and a compulsive eater of candy, with parallels to Mickey Rooney. * Bob Random as Oscar \\"John\\" Dale, the pretty, androgynous leading man of Hannaford's new film, who walked out mid-filming, leaving the picture unfinished. Like \\"The Actress\\", Dale's performance is entirely silent. * Lilli Palmer as Zarah Valeska, an enigmatic, retired leading lady from the 1930s who owns the ranch which hosts Hannaford's party. The character was based on Welles' old friend Marlene Dietrich, whom he very much wanted to play the role; however, Dietrich was unavailable for filming. Although she appears alongside Strasberg and members of the \\"Hannaford Mafia\\" in several scenes, all of Palmer's footage was shot in Europe. * Edmond O'Brien as Pat Mullins, an aging actor with far right political leanings who is one of Hannaford's cronies. * Mercedes McCambridge as Maggie Noonan, Hannaford's devoted editor. * Cameron Mitchell as Matt \\"Zimmie\\" Zimmer, a Texas-born make-up artist of Jewish heritage and one of Hannaford's artistic collaborators. Although he is fired by Costello en route to the ranch, Hannaford later notes that he has frequently fired and rehired Zimmer during past productions. During the party, Zimmer situates an array of John Dale-inspired dummies for Hannaford to shoot at. * Paul Stewart as Matt Costello, Hannaford's personal assistant and another member of the \\"Hannaford Mafia\\". He is reputed to have a long-standing association with the House Un-American Activities Committee. * Gregory Sierra as Jack Simon, a macho screenwriter with parallels to John Milius, who questions Hannaford's sexual orientation in front of Otterlake. * Tonio Selwart as The Baron, a parody of Welles' former business partner John Houseman (or his friend producer Alessando Tasca di Cut√≤), whom he had acrimoniously separated from in the 1940s, and who published several memoirs throughout the 1970s which were scathing of Welles, but who is presented here as doting and devoted. He doubles as Hannaford's primary screenwriter. * Dan Tobin as Dr. Bradley Pease Burroughs, Professor of English Literature at Clivedale Academy, a boys' boarding school in Franahan, Ohio, which had been implicated in a pederasty scandal involving another teacher. His former star pupil is John Dale. When Pease Burroughs is brought out to Hannaford's party to discuss Dale he is noticeably ill-at-ease in the unfamiliar atmosphere of Hollywood. * John Carroll as Lou Martin, an actor who is another member of the \\"Hannaford Mafia\\". * Stafford Repp as Al Denny, an actor who is another member of the \\"Hannaford Mafia\\". * Geoffrey Land as Max David, a young studio boss and former child actor, spoofing Robert Evans. * Joseph McBride as Mr. Pister, an amalgamation of various cinephiles and socially awkward film critics whom Welles had met over the years. * Pat McMahon as Marvin P. Fassbender, a bumptious film journalist. * Cathy Lucas as Mavis Henscher, a spoof of Bogdanovich's then-girlfriend, actress Cybill Shepherd (who was present for at least some of the filming, and whose brother, Bill Shepherd, was part of the production crew filming in Arizona). A young actress, Henscher has difficulty balancing her acting career with the correspondence course her home state makes her take while working. * Howard Grossman as Charles Higgam, Hannaford's biographer, a parody of Charles Higham, who had written an influential and unflattering 1970 biography of Welles which had wounded him with its Freudian accusation that he had a \\"fear of completion\\" on films. A 1970 Higham article publicizing the biography had directly led to one major investor pulling out from The Other Side of the Wind, who was put off by the \\"fear of completion\\" charge. The role was originally played by Bogdanovich, but then re-shot with Grossman when Bogdanovich switched to playing Otterlake. Although Higgam was a more prominent character in the earlier scripts, his role is sharply reduced in the final film. * Robert Aiken as the driver in Hannaford's film-within-a- film, who is the jealous boyfriend of the unnamed actress played by Kodar. * Gene Clark as the projectionist at Hannaford's party. * Peter Jason as Grover. * Larry Jackson as Roger, an avant-garde young filmmaker. * Cassie Yates as Martine, an avant-garde young filmmaker. * Benny Rubin as Abe Vogel, based on veteran Hollywood agent Abe Lastfogel. * Henry Jaglom as himself. * Paul Mazursky as himself. * Dennis Hopper as himself. * Curtis Harrington as himself. * Claude Chabrol as himself. * St√©phane Audran as herself. * George Jessel as himself. * Angelo Rossitto as himself. * Richard Wilson as himself. * Rich Little as a party guest. * Cameron Crowe as a party guest. * Les Moonves as a party guest. * Orson Welles as the voice of a journalist (uncredited). * Documentary filmmakers were played by Gary Graver, Frank Marshall, Mike Ferris, Eric Sherman, Felipe Herba, Paul Hunt, Bill Weaver and Mark Turnbull. Due to the 48 years taken for the film to be completed, and the advanced age of many of the actors playing Hollywood veterans, most cast members died long before the film's 2018 release. The first two major cast members to pass away were Stafford Repp in November 1974 (before principal photography had even been completed), and Norman Foster in July 1976 (only six months after filming wrapped). Both had shot all of their scenes in the first half of 1974. Other cast members who died before the film's 2018 release included Huston, Strasberg, Palmer, O'Brien, McCambridge, Mitchell, Stewart, Selwart, Tobin, Carroll, Rubin, Mazursky, Hopper, Harrington, Chabrol, Audran, Jessel, Rossitto, Wilson, Graver, and of course Welles himself (who has a cameo as an offscreen journalist). Over the years, while the film's negative remained sealed in a Paris vault, several production members expressed frustration at their inability to see the film - Tonio Selwart, for instance, was in his late 70s when he acted in it, and considered it his \\"swan song\\" from acting. Even in 1992, at the age of 95, he regretted that he would probably never see it ‚Äî not only because of his age but because of his gradual loss of sight. He would die in 2002, aged 106, still having never seen the film or his performance in it. =Casting insights= The film features an exceptionally large number of film directors in acting roles, including Claude Chabrol, Norman Foster, Gary Graver, Curtis Harrington, Dennis Hopper, Henry Jaglom and Paul Mazursky, mostly playing Hannaford's entourage of journalists and young filmmakers. Other Hollywood celebrities who were friends of Welles were asked to participate, including Jack Nicholson, but either declined or were unavailable.Giorgio Gossetti (ed.), Orson Welles and Oja Kodar, The Other Side of the Wind: sc√©nario-screenplay (Locarno International Film Festival/Cahiers du Cin√©ma, Switzerland, 2005) The film's script identifies several celebrities such as Jack Nicholson as being present at the party, but Nicholson was not in the final film. Impressionist Rich Little was originally cast as Brooks Otterlake, but his role was recast part of the way through. There are differing accounts as to the reason for his departure. Welles expressed dissatisfaction with the impressionist's acting ability, and stated that he fired him. Little says that he doesn't know why he lost contact with Welles part of the way through filming. Cinematographer Gary Graver tells a different story: \\"We shot many, many scenes with him, and he was quite good in each of them....One day, completely out of the blue, Rich showed up with his suitcase in his hand. 'Orson,' he said, 'I haven't seen my wife in a long time. I have to go home.' And like that, he was gone!...Orson didn't get angry. He just sat there looking incredulous. He couldn't believe what was happening. The rapport between Orson and Rich had been a good one, so no one had expected Rich's sudden departure.\\"Andrew J. Rausch (ed.), Gary Graver, Making Movies With Orson Welles: A Memoir (Scarecrow Press, University of Michigan, 2008) p. 40 Filming was completed with Bogdanovich playing Otterlake. This necessitated reshooting all of Little's scenes. Little's interpretation of the Otterlake character would have had him using a different accent or impression for every single scene ‚Äî a device which Joseph McBride thought \\"uncomfortably labored\\". By contrast, although Bogdanovich did several impressions in character as Otterlake, he played most of his scenes with his own voice. Previously, Bogdanovich played cineaste Charles Higgam by doing an impression of Jerry Lewis at Welles' request.Interview with Peter Bogdanovich and Joseph McBride on The Other Side of the Wind; accessed August 14, 2014. The characters played by Foster, Selwart, Jessel, McCambridge, O'Brien, Stewart, Wilson, Mitchell, Carroll and Repp form Hannaford's entourage, representing the \\"Old Hollywood\\"; while Chabrol, Harrington, Hopper, Jaglom and Mazursky play thinly veiled versions of themselves, representing the \\"New Hollywood.\\" The \\"Old Hollywood\\" characters serve as something of a chorus for Hannaford, providing various commentaries on his life. According to the shooting script, Welles intended to provide the film's short opening narration, intending to dub it in post-production. However, he never recorded it. Many of the cast and crew worked for free, or for low wages, or in exchange for favours from Welles. Huston, a close friend of Welles, worked for the nominal fee of $75,000 ‚Äî some of which is still owed to his estate, after one of the film's producers embezzled part of the budget. Welles said he could not afford to pay his cinematographer Gary Graver, so instead gave him his 1941 Academy Award statuette for the script of Citizen Kane by way of thanks. McBride's salary comprised two boxes of cigars. Mazursky recalled that he was never paid for his one night of acting. Crew Shot over many years in many locations, the film had many crew members, some of whom may be difficult to ascertain. The following crew list also contains the locations where they worked and any authenticating references. The crew members often were performing multiple tasks, so that defining the various roles is difficult. *Orson Welles, director, camera operator (throughout the whole film). *Gary Graver, director of photography, camera operator (throughout the whole film). *Bill Weaver, camera operator (Arizona). He was the co-inventor (with Robert Steadman) of the Weaver-Steadman balanced fluid head, 2 and 3 axis camera supports widely used in Hollywood productions. *Peter Jason, production assistant, camera assistant (Arizona). Primarily an actor in the film, but he also slated scenes for the camera department. He has over 200 acting credits on IMDb. *Neil Canton, production assistant (Arizona). He went on to produce Back to the Future Part I, II, & III, The Witches of Eastwick, Caddyshack II, Trespass, Get Carter, Geronimo: An American Legend and others. *Frank Marshall, unit production manager, production accountant (Arizona). Subsequently, a noted Hollywood producer. *Rick Waltzer, production assistant, camera assistant (Arizona). *Larry Jackson, grip (Arizona). He also acted in the film as the director of the documentary film crew following Jake Hannaford. He went on to become vice president of international acquisitions for the Samuel Goldwyn Company. *Polly Platt, art direction (Hannaford's film, and LA car scenes). Subsequently, a Hollywood producer, production designer and screenwriter. *Bill Shepherd, grip (Arizona) *Ruth Hasty, post production supervisor (Hollywood), joining the production in 2014. She has post production supervisor and other credits on The Talented Mr. Ripley, Mission Impossible, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 2, Jurassic Park and many others. *Bob Murawski, editor, joining the production in 2017. He has editor credits on The Hurt Locker, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3 and many others. * Vincent Marich, costume designer (Los Angeles). Production history = Inception of the project, 1961‚Äì70 = The film had a troubled production history. Like many of Welles' personally funded films, the project was filmed and edited on-and-off for several years. The project evolved from an idea Welles had in 1961 after the suicide of Ernest Hemingway. Welles had known Hemingway since 1937, and was inspired to write a screenplay about an aging macho bullfight enthusiast who is fond of a young bullfighter. Nothing came of the project for a while, but work on the script resumed in Spain in 1966, just after Welles had completed Chimes at Midnight. Early drafts were entitled Sacred Beasts and turned the older bullfight enthusiast into a film director. At a 1966 banquet to raise funds for the project, Welles told a group of prospective financiers: > Our story is about a pseudo-Hemingway, a movie director. So the central > figure ... you can barely see through the hair on his chest; who was > frightened by Hemingway at birth. He's a tough movie director who has killed > three or four extras on every picture ... [but is] full of charm. Everybody > thinks he's great. In our story he's riding around following a bullfighter, > and living through him ... but he's become obsessed by this young man who > has become ... his own dream of himself. He's been rejected by all his old > friends. He's finally been shown up to be a kind of voyeur ... a fellow who > lives off other people's danger and death.Clinton Heylin, Despite the > System: Orson Welles Versus the Hollywood Studios (Edinburgh: Canongate, > 2005), p. 351. =Production approach= Welles described the film's unconventional style to Peter Bogdanovich during an interview on the set: > I'm going to use several voices to tell the story. You hear conversations > taped as interviews, and you see quite different scenes going on at the same > time. People are writing a book about him‚Äîdifferent books. Documentaries ... > still pictures, films, tapes. All these witnesses ... The movie's going to > be made up of all this raw material. You can imagine how daring the cutting > can be, and how much fun. [PB: Have you written a screenplay?] Four of them. > But most of it's got to be ad-libbed. I've worked on it for so long‚Äîyears. > ... If I were a nineteenth-century novelist, I'd have written a three-volume > novel. I know everything that happened to that man. And his family‚Äîwhere he > comes from‚Äîeverything; more than I could ever try to put in a movie. His > family‚Äîhow they were competing with the Kennedys and the Kellys to get out > of the lace-curtain Irish department. I love this man and I hate him.Orson > Welles and Peter Bogdanovich (ed. Jonathan Rosenbaum), This is Orson Welles > (New York: Da Capo, 1992 [revised 1998 edition]), pp. 171-73. John Huston confirmed that the film was photographed in a highly unconventional style: \\"It's through these various cameras that the story is told. The changes from one to another ‚Äî color, black and white, still, and moving ‚Äî made for a dazzling variety of effects.\\" He added that principal photography was highly improvised, with the script only loosely being adhered to. At one point, Welles told him, \\"John, just read the lines or forget them and say what you please. The idea is all that matters.\\" In addition to the tightly edited montage of different styles for the main film, Hannaford's film-within-the-film was photographed in an entirely different style, at a much slower pace, as a pastiche of Antonioni. Welles said at the time: \\"There's a film with the film, which I made [in 1970-71] with my own money. It's the old man's attempt to do a kind of counterculture film, in a surrealist, dreamlike style. We see some of it in the director's projection room, some of it at a drive-in when that breaks down. It's about 50% of the whole movie. Not the kind of film I'd want to make; I've invented a style for him.\\" In 1972, Welles said that filming was \\"96% complete,\\" (which seems to have been an exaggeration, since many of the film's key scenes were not shot until 1973‚Äì1975‚Äîalthough it was literally true that The Other Side of the Wind, the film-within-the-film, was complete by that stage) and in January 1976 the last scene of principal photography was completed. =Locations= Much of the party scene was filmed in 1974 on Stage 1 at Southwestern Studio in Carefree, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, with John Huston, Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Stafford Repp, Dan Tobin, Norman Foster, Cathy Lucas, Peter Jason, and others.Brechner, K. C. (1986), Welles' Farewell, \\"The Other Side of the Wind\\", American Cinematographer, 67 (7), 34-38. Welles used the living room set and furniture designed for The New Dick Van Dyke Show that remained standing when the show left Southwestern Studio to return to CBS in Hollywood. Southwestern Studio was demolished in 1999. Other party scenes were shot in 1974 in a private mansion among the boulders of Carefree, not far from the studio, that was rented by Welles and used as his and other members of the company's residence during the shoot. The opposite house on the same street was used in Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point. Further party scenes were shot in Bogdanovich's own Beverly Hills house, which Welles stayed in for over two years in 1974‚Äì1976, after the film's financial problems meant that the crew could no longer go on renting the Arizona studio and mansion. Parts of the scenery from the previous shoot were redeployed to the Beverly Hills house. Other scenes were shot in Reseda (where the drive-in cinema scenes were filmed in the same location as the climax of Bogdanovich's Targets), Culver City (where the skyscrapers form the backdrop of some of Hannaford's film), Connecticut, France (at Welles' house in Orvilliers), the Netherlands, England, Spain, Belgium, and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer back-lot in Hollywood. The scenes shot on the M.G.M. back-lot, viewed in Hannaford's film- within-a-film, were photographed without M.G.M.'s permission. Welles was smuggled onto the back-lot in a darkened van, while the rest of the cast and crew pretended to be a group of film students visiting the studio. The crew was not confident that they would ever be able to access the back-lot again, and so filmed everything over one long, amphetamine-fuelled week-end in 1970, without sleep. The back-lot, which was seriously dilapidated, was demolished shortly afterwards, and only one more film ‚Äì That's Entertainment! (1974) ‚Äì was shot there before its demolition.\\"Orson Welles: The One-Man Band\\" documentary by Oja Kodar (1995). = Beginning of production, 1970‚Äì71 = When Welles moved back to the United States in the late 1960s, the script's setting changed to Hollywood, and second-unit photography started in August 1970. Principal photography in 1970‚Äì1971 focused on Hannaford's film-within-a-film. Welles was initially unsure whom to cast as the film director and whether to play the role himself, finally settling in 1974 on his friend the actor- director John Huston. The few party scenes shot before 1974 were shot without Huston, and often contained just one side of a conversation, with Huston's side of the conversation filmed several years later and intended to be edited into the earlier footage. = First pause in filming, 1971‚Äì73 = Filming ground to a halt late in 1971 when the U.S. government decided that Welles' European company was a holding company, not a production company, and retrospectively presented him with a large tax bill. Welles had to work on numerous other projects to pay off this debt, and filming could not resume until 1973. During that time, Welles acted in a number of other projects to raise funds, and secured further financing in France, Iran and Spain. Some scenes were shot intermittently in 1973, as and when cast were available (as with Lilli Palmer's scenes, all shot in Spain without any other cast present); but the film's main production block did not begin until early 1974, when major shooting of the party happened in Arizona. =1974 production block, alleged embezzlement, and second major pause in the filming= Filming resumed for an intensive four months of production in January to April 1974, when most of the party scenes were shot, but principal photography was undermined by serious financial problems, including embezzlement by one of the investors, who fled with much of the film's budget. Barbara Leaming described the situation in her biography of Welles, based on extensive interviews with Welles: > The first of the backers Orson managed to find in Paris was a Spanish > acquaintance of his from the international film community who > enthusiastically agreed to kick in $350,000, a little less than half of what > Orson and Oja had already invested. Shortly thereafter an equivalent sum was > pledged by a French-based Iranian group headed by Mehdi B[o]ushehri, the > brother-in-law of the Shah ... Dominique Antoine, a Frenchwoman, made the > deal with Orson on behalf of the Iranians ... Orson left France with the > understanding that the Spanish partner would act as intermediary with the > Iranians in Paris ... But no sooner were Orson and Oja in Spain than trouble > started. \\"We were perfectly all right as long as I was using Oja's money and > mine,\\" says Orson, \\"but the moment we got associates!\\" The Iranians appeared > not to be living up to their end of the deal. Orson heard from the Spaniard > who had flown in from Paris, that the Iranians had not given him the money > they had promised. There were heavy rains and flooding in Spain, so Orson > and Oja were basically cooped up in their hotel, where they worked on a new > script together. The Spaniard returned to Paris to try again. \\"In a minute > they're going to have it,\\" he told Orson later. \\"It looks all right.\\" In > lieu of the Iranian funds, he gave them very small sums of money, which he > said were part of the investment he had agreed to make. Not until afterward > did Orson discover that the Iranians had indeed been giving the Spaniard the > promised money, which had come from Iran in cash, and that, instead of > bringing it to Spain, the sly fellow was pocketing it. Says Orson: \\"We just > sat, month after month, while he went to Paris, received the money, and came > back and told us that they wouldn't give him any money. He was very > convincing to us, and very convincing with them in Paris. He kept flying > back and forth extracting money from them. We didn't know them, you see. We > knew him.\\" The small sums of money he had been giving Orson as if from his > own pocket actually came out of the Iranian funds. His constant reassurance > to Orson that the Iranians were about to come through was calculated to keep > Orson in Spain out of contact with them. On his part, Orson did not want to > interfere in what he presumed were his emissary's delicate negotiations with > them. It simply never occurred to him that the fellow was lying‚Äîand had > never any money of his own to invest in the first place... Meanwhile, due to > foul weather, Orson had decided to abandon Spain for Arizona, where John > Huston and a host of other faithfuls joined him. ... The swindler continued > his game of collecting cash from the Iranians who, having heard only from > him, still did not know that anything was wrong. When they received a telex > purportedly from John Huston's agent to ask for a $60,000 advance, Dominique > Antoine did ask for further verification. But this did not deter the > swindler, who sent her a Screen Actor's Guild form with a bogus Social > Security number and signature from the States. The Iranians dispatched the > $60,000, which was pocketed by the Spaniard rather than Huston, who, out of > friendship for Orson, was actually working for much less. After having sent > the money, Dominique Antoine had second thoughts about it. Until now she had > deliberately left Orson alone because she sensed he preferred it that way. > But now something told her there was a problem. \\"I think I have to go > there,\\" she told Boushehri, \\"even if Orson isn't pleased.\\" Since Orson had > yet to receive a penny from the Iranians, their French representative was > the last person he expected to see in the Arizona desert. He could not have > been happy to see her. When almost instantly he asked her where the money > was, she nervously told him that she had been making regular payments to the > intermediary, who obviously hadn't passed them on to him, he broke down. The film's producer Dominique Antoine subsequently endorsed the above account from Barbara Leaming as being \\"entirely accurate.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum, \\"The Invisible Orson Welles: A First Inventory\\" (1985), reproduced in Jonathan Rosenbaum, Discovering Orson Welles (University of California Press, 2009), p. 80. A July 1986 article in American Cinematographer also corroborates this story, describing Antoine's arrival in Arizona on the set at Southwestern Studios late at night.Brechner, K.C. (1986) Welles' Farewell, \\"The Other Side of the Wind\\", American Cinematographer, 67 (7), 34-38. This story is further corroborated by Peter Bogdanovich, who wrote in November 1997 of the production, \\"another producer ran back to Europe with $250,000 of Orson's money and never was heard from again (although I recently saw the person on TV accepting an Oscar for coproducing the Best Foreign Film of the year.)\\"Peter Bogdanovich, \\"New Introduction: My Orson\\", in Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich (ed. by Jonathan Rosenbaum), This is Orson Welles (1998 edn), p. xxviii. In 2008, film scholars Jean-Pierre Berthom√© and Fran√ßois Thomas identified Spanish producer Andr√©s Vicente G√≥mez (who collected a Best Foreign Picture Oscar in 1994) as the alleged embezzler, and they date his withdrawal from the project to 1974.Jean-Pierre Berthom√© and Fran√ßois Thomas, Orson Welles at Work (London: Phaidon, 2008), pp. 289, 292. G√≥mez first met Welles in Spain in 1972, during the making of Treasure Island, in which they were both involved. G√≥mez then negotiated Welles' deal with the Iranian-owned, Paris-based \\"Les Films de l'Astrophore\\", the first product of which was the 1973 film F for Fake, followed by The Other Side of the Wind.Andr√©s Vicente G√≥mez, \\"Chapter IV: The Teachings of Orson Welles\\", in A Crazy Dream, 2001 memoir, with the manuscript made available online on the website of LolaFilms, G√≥mez's production company. As well as the accusation of embezzlement, Welles also had this to say of G√≥mez: \\"My Spanish producer never paid my hotel bill for the three months that he kept me waiting in Madrid for the money for The Other Side of the Wind. So I'm scared to death to be in Madrid. I know they're going to come after me with that bill.\\"Peter Biskind (ed.), My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles (New York: Metropolitan Books), p. 92. G√≥mez responded to these accusations in a 2001 memoir, subsequently reproduced on his company website: > Regarding the end of my relationship with Orson Welles some lies were told, > although he assured me they did not come from him. [A point contradicted by > the extensively quoted Leaming account above, which showed the accusations > came from an interview with Welles himself; as well as the quote about the > hotel bill, which comes from a subsequently emerged (in 2013) audio tape of > Welles.] Accordingly, I don't want to go into that matter. I don't deem it > relevant to mention the details of our split considering that our > relationship was always polite and amicable and we had wonderful moments and > experiences together. However, I must make it clear that if I abandoned the > project, I didn't do so for financial reasons. My agreement with Welles, > written and signed by him, envisaged my work as a producer, not an investor. > ... Certain people who were close to Welles and part of his inner circle - > the same ones who are spoiling his works and making a living from them‚Äîtried > to justify his difficulties by linking them to the fact that I pulled out. > They have even gone so far as to say that I had pocketed some of the Iranian > money which in fact never existed, beyond the funds that were spent > appropriately. G√≥mez was later interviewed for a 2018 documentary on the making of the film, They'll Love Me When I'm Dead, in which he said, \\"I read he blamed me because of the finance fiasco, which is totally untrue. I made a settlement with him, there was no complaint, there was no anything. If it was true, why didn't they make any claim from me, you know?\\"They'll Love Me When I'm Dead (2018), dir. Morgan Neville. Josh Karp's 2015 book on the making of the film cited several pieces of documentary proof which support the allegation: > There are two sets of documents that support this version of events. The > first is an August 1974 legal agreement dissolving Orson's partnership with > everyone but Astrophore which specifies that [G√≥mez's] company \\"failed to\\" > provide its own investment of $150,000 and also had failed to open a > production account as it had been obligated to do under a 1973 agreement. > Additionally, it claims that the producer's company had misappropriated a > whole or substantial part of the money received from Astrophore. > In 1976 and 1977, Boushehri had Coopers and Lybrand audit both Astrophore > and the production of The Wind. In each report the auditors stated that > Avenel [Welles and Kodar's production company] had signed an August 3, 1973, > agreement with the producer's company and with Astrophore under which Orson > and Oja's interest in the film was $750,000, while the Iranians and the > man's production company were each obligated to provide $150,000 toward > completion of the movie. The audits repeat the accusation that the producer > misappropriated money he was supposed to transmit from Astrophore to > Orson.Josh Karp, Orson Welles's Last Movie: The Making of The Other Side of > the Wind (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2015) Karp's 2015 book also reproduces contemporary (May 2, 1974) correspondence from one of the film's creditors Jim Hines to Frank Marshall, in which Hines claims that \\"The Maricopa County, Arizona prosecutor's office has filed Criminal charges\\" against G√≥mez, and that \\"They have completed their initial investigation and will issue a warrant for his incarceration should he return to the United States. Grand Larceny is an extraditable offense and, as of May 5th (I believe) he will be considered a fugitive by both the State of Arizona and the United States. His Federal Offense will be interstate flight to avoid Prosecution.\\" G√≥mez's 2001 memoir notes that after leaving the set in Arizona, he travelled to California to get a flight to New Mexico, where he spent three days drinking and smoking marijuana with Dennis Hopper, before returning to Spain, where \\"an office awaited me in Madrid that served the purpose of a production-distribution company\\" which kick-started his new career as a distributor of arthouse films in Spain. Karp nonetheless notes that G√≥mez \\"has never been charged with a crime, nor been the subject to a civil suit in connection with the accusation.\\" = Further attempts to raise funds and complete the film, 1975‚Äì76 = With the film's mounting financial problems after the March 1974 disappearance of G√≥mez and the simultaneous disappearance of many of the film's funds, Welles had to abandon the Arizona shoot in April 1974 before he could complete all principal photography. In particular, although he had shot seven weeks of footage with Rich Little in one of the lead roles, the re-casting of Peter Bogdanovich in the role meant that many of the film's key scenes had to be re-shot. Accordingly, in 1974 Welles moved into Bogdanovich's Beverly Hills mansion, where he lived on and off for the next few years, and where he intermittently shot more party scenes, until principal photography finally wrapped in January 1976. In February 1975, Welles was awarded an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, and used the star- studded ceremony as an opportunity to pitch for funding to complete the film. (With a touch of irony, one of the scenes he showed his audience featured Hannaford screening a rough cut of his latest film to a studio boss, in a bid for \\"end money\\" to complete his picture.) Sure enough, one producer made what Welles later called a \\"wonderful offer\\", but Antoine turned it down on the assumption that an even better offer would arrive. No such offer came, and Welles later bitterly regretted the refusal, commenting before his death that if he'd accepted it \\"the picture would have been finished now and released.\\" Welles estimated that the editing of the film in a distinctive and experimental style would take approximately one year of full-time work (which was how long he had spent on the experimental, rapidly cut editing of his previous completed film, F for Fake ‚Äì like F for Fake, the film would have averaged approximately one edit per second, and would have lasted around half an hour longer). On F for Fake, Welles had used three separate moviolas, arranged side-by-side, to simultaneously edit the film. He would perform the cuts to the negative himself, then leave an editing assistant at each moviola to complete the edit while he moved to the next moviola to begin the next edit. The Other Side of the Wind necessitated even more complicated editing, and Welles lined up five moviolas in a semi-circle around a table, with a staff of assistants to help him.Jean-Pierre Berthom√© and Fran√ßois Thomas, Orson Welles at Work (London: Phaidon, 2008), p. 293. A change of management at the Iranian production company in 1975 resulted in tensions between Welles and the backers. The new management saw Welles as a liability, and refused to pay him to edit the film. The company made several attempts to reduce Welles' share of the film profits from 50% to 20%, and crucially, attempted to remove his artistic control over the film's final cut. Welles made numerous attempts to seek further financial backing to pay him to complete the editing full- time, including attempting to interest a Canadian backer, but no such funding materialised, and so Welles only edited the film piecemeal in his spare time over the next decade, between other acting assignments which the heavily indebted actor-director needed to support himself. =Production dates= The following dates are provided by Jonathan Rosenbaum's chronology of Welles' career:Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich (ed.

Bogdanovich, in character as Otterlake, recorded a slightly amended narration for the final film. *With 40‚Äì45 minutes of film edited by Welles, approximately 75‚Äì80 minutes still required editing. *The film lacked a musical score, although Welles had indicated that he wanted a jazz score. *Two shots had never been recorded: the dummies exploding after being shot, and the final shot of the last car leaving the drive-in theatre. The first was provided with the help of CGI, as dummies shot against a green screen were blended in with manipulated footage of rocks; the second was provided through use of stock footage of a drive-in theatre, with Hannaford's film digitally inserted onto the screen. *Among the 96 hours of footage, it was found that the original quad sound tapes for many of the 1974 recording sessions were missing. This had to be provided through a combination of digitally cleaned-up second- or third-generation sound sources (i.e. on Welles' workprint material), or through modern actors dubbing, in some cases just dubbing individual words or syllables to salvage line recordings that were otherwise retrieved from the workprint. =Legal difficulties, and efforts to complete the film= 1979‚Äì1997 By 1979, forty minutes of the film had been edited by Welles. But in that year, the film experienced serious legal and financial complications. Welles' use of funds from Mehdi Boushehri, the brother-in-law of the Shah of Iran, became troublesome after the Shah was overthrown. A complex, decades-long legal battle over the ownership of the film ensued, with the original negative remaining in a vault in Paris. At first, the revolutionary government of Ayatollah Khomeini had the film impounded along with all assets of the previous regime. When they deemed the negative worthless, there was extensive litigation as to the ownership of the film. By 1998, many of the legal matters had been resolved and the Showtime cable network had guaranteed \\"end money\\" to complete the film. However, continuing legal complications in the Welles estate and a lawsuit by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles, caused the project to be suspended. When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his longtime companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \\"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \\"blocked\\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles - Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.)Jonathan Rosenbaum, Discovering Orson Welles (University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 2009) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced - Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on. Although the original negative of the film long remained in a Paris vault, two workprint versions of much of the raw footage were privately held - one by Welles' cinematographer Gary Graver, who shot the film, and one by Welles himself, who covertly smuggled a copy out of Paris after the legal difficulties started.http://www.howardswains.com/?page_id=207 Welles left his own workprint copy to Kodar, as part of the clause of his will giving her all his unfinished film materials. (Kodar can be seen visiting a storeroom containing these materials in the Orson Welles: One Man Band documentary.) Over the years, there were repeated attempts to clear the remaining legal obstacles to the film's completion, and to obtain the necessary finance. Those most closely involved in these efforts were Gary Graver (the film's cinematographer), Oja Kodar (as Welles' partner, co-writer and co-star of the film, and director of one of its sequences, as well as the copyright holder of Welles' unfinished work), director Peter Bogdanovich (a co-star and investor, although he only wants the return of his $500,000 rather than any share of profits), film critic Joseph McBride (who has a supporting role in the film), and Hollywood producer Frank Marshall, one of whose first jobs in the film business was as production manager on the film. Marshall in particular was instrumental in getting several major studios in the late 1990s to watch a rough cut, although most were put off by the film's legal issues. Before a deal was put together in 1998, Oja Kodar screened Gary Graver's rough cut of the film for a number of famous directors in the 1980s and 1990s, seeking their help in completing the film, but they all turned it down for various reasons. These included John Huston (who was by then terminally ill with emphysema and was unable to breathe without oxygen tubes), Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Clint Eastwood and George Lucas. Lucas reportedly claimed to be baffled by the footage, saying he didn't know what to do with it, and that it was too avant-garde for a commercial audience. Kodar subsequently accused both Eastwood and Stone of plagiarism from the film, citing Eastwood's performance in White Hunter Black Heart (1990) as a copy of John Huston's, including one line of dialogue (\\"I'm Marvin P. Fassbender.\\" \\"Of course you are.\\"), and Stone's adoption of the film's distinctive rapidly cut editing and camera style for his JFK (1991), Nixon (1995) and Natural Born Killers (1994). 1998‚Äì2013 A turning point came in 1998, when Mehdi Boushehri changed his mind, and was convinced by the film's surviving makers that his best hope of recouping his money was to see the film released. He therefore compromised on his earlier claims to owning two-thirds of the film, and reduced the share he claimed. This resolved several of the film's legal problems. Boushehri died in 2006, but his heirs similarly accepted that the best hope of any return on Boushehri's investment was for the film to finally be released. The 1998 deal struck with Boushehri led to funding being put up by the Showtime network, until the lawsuit from Beatrice Welles later that year stalled matters once more. Peter Bogdanovich announced in 2004 that he planned to restore the film and release it soon thereafter. He cited a conversation before Welles' death in which \\"Orson said to me, 'If anything happens to me, you will make sure you finish it, won't you?' It was, of course, a compliment and also a terrible moment. He pressed me to give some assurance.\\" However, there remained both legal challenges, and technical challenges over replicating Welles' avant-garde editing style. In 2006, Oja Kodar expressed concerns about a proposed deal Beatrice Welles had made with Showtime to turn the film into a \\"kind of\\" documentary, with the intention of never allowing it to be released as a completed theatrical film. A new deal was then eventually struck in 2007, in which the three parties previously involved (Oja Kodar as the heir of Welles' unfinished work, Mehdi Boushehri's heirs, and the Showtime Network) agreed to pay off Beatrice Welles with an undisclosed sum and/or share of profits from the film.Brian Clark, \\"Timeline: The Long and Tortured History of Orson Welles' Lost Film, The Other Side of the Wind\\", Movieline, January 28, 2011. At a March 29, 2007, appearance at the Florida Film Festival, Bogdanovich, in response to a question about the status of the film, stated that the four parties involved had come to an agreement earlier that week and that the film would be edited and released in the very near future. Bogdanovich also stated in an April 2, 2007, press reportArticle:\\"Deal Near on a Lost Welles\\", New York Sun, April 2, 2007. that a deal to complete the film was \\"99.9% finished\\", with a theatrical release planned for late 2008. There were then further complications in 2007, through the intervention of Paul Hunt. He had worked on the film in the 1970s as a Line Producer, an Assistant Editor, Assistant Camera Operator and Gaffer, and was described by Gary Graver's son as \\"the strangest, weirdest guy you've ever met.\\" Kodar had approached him to see if he could broker a deal, guiding him as to who controlled the rights and suggesting what kind of deal they would accept. Together with his producing partner Sanford Horowitz, Hunt formed a company, \\"Horowitz Hunt LLC\\", and within three months had a signed deal with Mehdi Boushehri, with an option to acquire his rights of the movie. On August 6, 2007 Horowitz Hunt LLC filed with the US Copyright office Mehdi Boushehri's signed agreement to transfer the rights to the movie. http://www.projectwelles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Copyright-Motion- Picture.pdf Horowitz and Hunt's goal was to release two versions of The Other Side of the Wind: a completed theatrical version and another uncompleted but original 42-minute version, reflecting Welles' workprint at the time of his death. In March 2008, Bogdanovich said that there was over a year's worth of work left to be done, and a month later, he filmed the opening of the Los Angeles vault where Oja Kodar had kept the workprint material cut by Welles, along with other positive film materials. However, the full original negative remained sealed in a warehouse in France. Throughout the rest of 2008, some work was done on the Los Angeles material. In June 2008, the Showtime Network set up an editing suite in Los Angeles, to begin preliminary logging in work on all of the material. Bogdanovich personally directed the work, Tim King was the Showtime Executive in charge of post-production, Sasha Welles (a nephew of Oja Kodar) worked on the production as an Assistant Editor, and internships were advertised for people to work on cataloguing the film materials. Horowitz Hunt LLC eventually began negotiations with Oja Kodar to acquire her rights, but they were unsuccessful in coming to terms with Kodar, when Beatrice Welles put an injunction on access to the negative stored at the LTC Film Vault in Paris, by proclaiming an inheritance claim, thus preventing the opening of the Paris vault containing the full 96 hours of original negatives, some of which had not even been seen by Welles in his lifetime.\\"Is a Showtime deal near to complete Orson Welles's THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND?\\" Wellesnet. The attorney for Boushehri neglected to send in their documentation nullifying Beatrice's claim and thus the project stalled once again. This resulted in the closure of the Showtime editing suite in December 2008, and Showtime eventually put the project on hold. An article in Variety in February 2009 stated that Showtime was still willing to pay for its completion, but they wanted to be sure all the materials existed. The negative still resided in a vault in Paris, unseen since the 1970s, but permission from all the estates had to be obtained before access to the negative could be granted. Bogdanovich stated, ‚ÄúIt's going to happen in the next month or so. We‚Äôre aiming for Cannes [in 2010]. Everybody wants it to happen. It's film history. It will be something for it to finally be seen after all these years.‚Äù In January 2010, during a public Q&A; after a screening of one of his films in Columbus, Ohio, Bogdanovich stated that the film had been examined and was in good condition, but \\"Orson left such a mess with who owned what\\", and wondered whether editing the film would even be possible. Bogdanovich indicated that the original negative was in excellent condition, with the picture quality being far superior to the poor-quality workprints seen in public so far. In 2012, he went on to say that he had examined the material himself, and told Canada's Toro magazine: A report in The Guardian in January 2011, suggested, once again, that a legal settlement was close and that a release would be possible in the near future. However, Oja Kodar denied that this was the case. Paul Hunt died in 2011. That same year, Sanford Horowitz and financier John Nicholas launched a company called \\"Project Welles The Other Side LLC\\" and the website www.projectwelles.com to attract additional capital and complete negotiations with Kodar and Beatrice Welles. Their goal was to present an uncluttered account of events, make peace with all the players, present their chain of title compiled by the law firm of Mitchell, Silberberg & Knuff and gain access to the film negatives stored in the LTC Film vault in Paris. By 2011, all copyright difficulties had theoretically been resolved between the respective parties. However, the Showtime network, which had previously pledged to provide funding for the project, refused to specify what the budget would be. Oja Kodar stated that she did not want a repeat of the debacle over Welles' posthumously completed Don Quixote, which was universally panned after being cheaply put together from badly decayed, incomplete footage which was sloppily edited, badly dubbed, and often incoherent. As such, she would not grant permission to proceed until she had received assurances that the project will be done professionally, and to a high standard, with an adequate budget. In March 2012, Matthew Duda, the Showtime executive who had championed funding for The Other Side of the Wind since 1998, retired, and this spelled the end of Showtime's involvement in the project. After his retirement, Duda contended that the greatest obstacle to the film's completion had been Oja Kodar. \\"Her price kept changing,\\" Duda said. \\"She kept getting higher and higher, and then she said we'd sabotaged her [nonexistent offer for more money].\\" Josh Karp, in his history of the film, concurred: ::\\"After retiring, Duda remained interested in the project but came to accept what he'd known all along. Oja had been the party everyone thought was essential to getting the project done. But throughout the years, she'd tried repeatedly to squeeze every bit of leverage she could out of potential investors and then would get cold feet when a deal was close, always believing something better was just around the bend. Though there had been roadblocks with Beatrice, Boushehri, Hunt, and the innumerable factors that seemed to curse the deal, it seemed that Oja had been the biggest obstacle of all preventing the completion of The Other Side of the Wind.\\" 2014‚Äì2018 completion of the film With the withdrawal of Showtime, producer Filip Jan Rymsza intervened in what would ultimately be a successful bid that would break the film's deadlock. Rymsza owned the Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment, and had become aware of the film's existence in 2009, being increasingly motivated to try and engineer its release. Very early on, he teamed up with both German producer Jens Koethner Kaul (who had already tried approaching Kodar in negotiations), and Frank Marshall.Josh Karp, Orson Welles's Last Movie: The Making of The Other Side of the Wind (New York: St Martin's Press, 2015), pp. 263. On October 28, 2014, Royal Road Entertainment announced that it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of Marshall, and would purchase the rights to complete and release The Other Side of the Wind. Bogdanovich and Marshall would oversee completion of the film in Los Angeles, aiming to have it ready for screening May 6, 2015 ‚Äî the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth. Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri. They reached an agreement with Oja Kodar, who inherited Welles' ownership of the film, and Beatrice Welles, manager of the Welles estate. On May 1, 2015, it was disclosed that the film was far from completed. Post-production was to be funded by pre-selling distribution rights, but in December some potential distributors asked to see edited footage from the negative, not the worn workprint. \\"People want to help us, but they have a business decision to make,\\" producer Frank Marshall told The New York Times. \\"They would first like to see an edited sequence, and I think that is a fair request.\\" A 40-day crowdfunding drive was launched May 7, 2015, on the Indiegogo website, with a goal of raising $2 million for digital scanning and editing. Plans were announced for the 1,083 reels of pristine negative footage to be flown from Paris to Los Angeles for 4K resolution scanning and editing by Affonso Gon√ßalves. Producers hoped to complete The Other Side of the Wind in 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles' birth, but no specific release date was identified. Noting that completion of the film should not be driven by a deadline, Marshall said, \\"We still think we will make it this year.\\" The Indiegogo campaign deadline was extended in June and the goal revised to $1,000,000 after potential outside investors offered to match that amount. Acknowledging that the campaign had struggled, Marshall said that his objective is to put the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film together to win over a distributor who will help finish the post-production. \\"They don't trust the fact that he was this genius and the guy that made Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil and The Magnificent Ambersons, and there might be this fantastic movie in there,\\" Marshall said. The campaign closed July 5, 2015, having raised $406,405. At the end of 2015, efforts to complete the film were at an impasse. On April 5, 2016, Wellesnet announced that Netflix had been negotiating for months on a two-picture deal worth $5 million for the completion of The Other Side of the Wind and a companion documentary. The potential deal requested the approval of Oja Kodar to finalize the agreement. In mid-March 2017, it was confirmed Netflix would distribute the film. In March 2017, the original negative, alongside dailies and other footage, arrived in Los Angeles, allowing the film's post-production work to resume. Later, the negatives were scanned in the offices of Technicolor in Hollywood. In November 2017, it was reported that various members had been hired to the post-production team, including Bob Murawski as editor, Scott Millan as sound mixer, and Mo Henry as negative cutter. The Herculean efforts to edit the 16mm and 35mm footage, match the workprint materials to the original negative and undertake much- needed ADR and sound restoration is detailed in the documentary short A Final Cut for Orson. In January 2018, a rough cut of the film was screened for a small, select group of invite-only attendees. Amongst those present were producer Filip Jan Rymsza, directors Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino and Rian Johnson; actors Danny Huston (son of the film's star, John Huston) and Crispin Glover; and The Other Side of the Wind cast and crew members Peter Bogdanovich, Lou Race, Neil Canton, and Peter Jason. In March 2018, Michel Legrand (who had previously composed the score for Welles' 1973 film F for Fake) was announced as providing the score to the film. He had been secretly working on the film since December 2017. Orchestral recording began on March 19, 2018, in Belgium, and continued with a jazz ensemble later that week in Paris, although Legrand could not be present for the recording sessions, having been hospitalised with pneumonia at the time. Speaking of his work on the project, Legrand stated: Release The film had its world premiere at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2018. It was also screened at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on September 1, 2018 and the New York Film Festival on September 29, 2018. It was released to select theaters and debuted on Netflix on November 2, 2018. Reception =Before release= As a member of the cast, film historian Joseph McBride saw the rushes, and later saw a two-hour rough cut assembled by Gary Graver in the late 1990s to attract potential investors. McBride wrote that the film \\"serves as both a time capsule of a pivotal moment in film history ‚Äî an 'instant' piece of period nostalgia set in the early seventies ‚Äî and a meditation on changing political, sexual and artistic attitudes in the United States during that period.\\" However, he differentiated the bulk of the film ‚Äî which he praised very highly ‚Äî from the footage of Hannaford's film-within-a-film: ::I found that while the languid visual style of the film-within-the-film interludes would give the audience ample time to recover from the frenetic pacing of the party scenes, a more serious obstacle to the film's playability is the largely undramatic nature of much of the material putatively shot by Hannaford. Little or nothing happens in these sequences except for Oja mysteriously wandering seminude around picturesque locales and Bob Random doggedly roaring his motorcycle through expressionistically lit landscapes. The footage is beautifully shot, and there is some stunning photographic magic, such as a sequence filmed among the skyscrapers of Century City with the two characters' images vanishing into ten mirrors arranged invisibly among the stone steps and glass columns of the coldly geometrical modern office buildings...However, in the rough cut assembled by Graver to show potential investors, the film-within-the-film sequences not only interrupt the narrative but also go on at such length that they lose their satirical point, becoming exasperating examples of what Welles was trying to spoof. Film critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has seen most of the film, either in rushes, or in scenes cut by Welles, and has praised its reflections on \\"late-60s media, not to mention its kamikaze style\\", and has contrasted this with the opinion of David Thomson, who has not seen the film, and who wrote in his highly critical biography of Welles, \\"One day, it may be freed. I hope not. The Other Side of the Wind should stay beyond reach.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum, \\"The Battle Over Orson Welles\\", in Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Discovering Orson Welles (University of California Press, Berkeley, 2007), p. 246. John Huston described a private screening in which Orson Welles showed the unfinished film to some friends: \\"I didn't get to see it, but those who did tell me it is a knockout.\\" Andr√©s Vicente G√≥mez, who was originally involved in the film's production, has been quoted in the press stating his opposition to the film ever being completed; he believes it would be an \\"act of betrayal\\".\\"Orson Welles's unseen masterpiece set for release\\", The Guardian, 23 January 2011. His argument is that the film was always unlikely to be finished because Welles' \\"physical condition was delicate. He didn't have the energy to cut it.\\"\\"Lost Orson Welles film may finally be released\\", 28 January 2011. However, as G√≥mez was accused by Orson Welles, Dominique Antoine, Peter Bogdanovich, Mehdi Boushehri and others of embezzling $250,000 of the film's budget and absconding with the proceeds, he does have a strong motive for wanting the film to not reach wider public attention.Jean-Pierre Berthom√© and Fran√ßois Thomas, Orson Welles at Work (Phaidon, London, 2008), pp. 289, 292; Peter Bogdanovich, \\"New Introduction: My Orson\\", in Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich (ed. by Jonathan Rosenbaum), This is Orson Welles (New York: Da Capo, 1992 [revised 1998 edition]), p.xxviii. Additionally, G√≥mez's links to the film were severed in 1974; but filming was not finished until 1976 (which is when most of the editing started), so G√≥mez was in no position to know whether Welles was up to editing when editing actually began. Director Rian Johnson told Vanity Fair in April 2018 he had seen a 117-minute edit‚Äîminus its Michel Legrand score‚Äîtwice, including a screening in Santa Monica, California, on January 16, 2018, with Quentin Tarantino, Alexander Payne and other VIPs, who \\"were all gobsmacked.\\" =After release= On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84%, based on 98 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critic consensus reads: \\"A satisfying must-watch for diehard cineastes, The Other Side of the Wind offers the opportunity to witness a long-lost chapter in a brilliant filmmaker's career.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.‚Äù Film critic and author of Orson Welles in Italy Alberto Anile, who watched the film at its premiere during the 75th Venice International Film Festival, called it \\"one of Welles's major works.\\" Film historian and actor in the film Joseph McBride confessed: \\"The final result exceeds even my high expectations.\\" The film was included on dozens of Best Films of 2018 lists, including Sight & Sound, Film Comment, The Hollywood Reporter, The Los Angeles Times and Vanity Fair. It received awards from the National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, San Francisco Film Critics Circle and others. In 2020, Rymsza and Murawski assembled Hopper / Welles, a 129-minute movie composed of largely unseen outtakes from The Other Side of the Wind shot in November 1970 in Los Angeles. The film is a conversation between Welles and Dennis Hopper on politics, religion and moviemaking.

In keeping with their pro-life charism, the Brothers advocate for the unborn, the handicapped, the elderly and the poor. Founders Michael Gaworski was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma July 31, 1958, and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. Active in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement, he became attracted to Franciscan spirituality after reading the Little Flowers of Saint Francis (Fioretti). He graduated from Saint Thomas Academy in 1977. The son of Charles and Mary Kaye O'Donnell, Paul Joseph O'Donnell was born December 15, 1959. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communications from the University of Saint Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1982. In 1986 O'Donnell and Gaworski founded P.E.A.C.E (renamed in 1986 Pro-Life Action Ministries). O'Donnell participated in thousands of prayer vigils and rallies at abortion facilities, and became a spokesperson for the fight against active euthanasia. Beginnings After attending the National Charismatic Renewal Conference held at Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana, in May 1982, Gawaorski, along with O'Donnell founded the Franciscan Brothers of Peace. In 1986, the Brotherhood was given canonical status as a Private Association of the Faithful. In 1991 Gaworski contracted a bacterial pneumonia which left him profoundly disabled. The Brothers assumed his 24-hour care. This experience led them to expand their ministry to advocate for brain injured persons. On January 1, 1994, Archbishop John R. Roach, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis designated the Brotherhood a Public Association of the Faithful. Michael Gaworski died August 28, 2003. Paul Joseph O'Donnell, longtime guardian (superior) of the Franciscan Brothers of Peace was also a founding board member of Human Life Alliance. O'Donnell died February 20, 2015, at the age of 55. Apostolate In November 2009 the Brothers conducted a holiday grocery drive which provided both Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to 575 families. In spring 2011 over 800 pounds of canned food was delivered to the Brothers \\"food shelf\\" program through the \\"Food for Fines\\" program of the University of St. Thomas library.

Originally published in West Germany in 1950, the book was translated into many languages (into English by Anthony G. Powell in 1956),Methuen & Co. London, 1956 and has been issued in numerous editions. The German High Command wished to gauge the morale of the troops of the encircled 6th Army, so they allowed the soldiers to write and send the letters which became the basis for Last Letters from Stalingrad. The letters were then impounded, opened, stripped of identification and sorted by content, before eventually being stored in archives.Notes for Elias Tanenbaum - Last Letters from Stalingrad at the Anthology of Recorded Music Unlike the usual military history accounts focusing on mass armies of anonymous men, the reader is presented with the personal tragedies of individual soldiers, the \\"single human being ... in the face of death\\", getting a tangible impression of the horrors of war. The letters are a \\"human document which bares the soul of the man at his worst hour\\", and by softening the identification of Germany with Nazism the book helped Germany to take its place in the Western post-war community of nations. French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand supposedly carried the French edition with him in the last months of his life, and drew inspiration from it in writing his speech for the 50th anniversary of the end of the war on the 8 May 1995. German jurist and legal scholar Wilhelm Raimund Beyer has questioned the authenticity of the letters. He questions their authenticity based on the textual style and based on his own experiences during the Battle of Stalingrad.:de:Letzte Briefe aus Stalingrad#Zweifel an Echtheit The letters refuse to admit the complete hopelessness of the 6th Army, and in fact (cited from letters never to be delivered, either pulled from corpses or retained by advancing Soviet troops), even the German Luftwaffe were being mauled by inadequate Russian fighter planes. These last pathetic realizations were censored by postmasters so as not to stain German invincibility at home.

Signs and symptoms The symptoms of heliophobia depends on the person. Mild sufferers may feel uncomfortable, shaky, nauseated, or numb. Severe sufferers may feel anxious or suffer panic attacks. Other symptoms include heightened senses, lack of focus, feeling trapped, irregular heartbeat, air hunger, rapid breathing, parched mouth, sweating, muscle cramps, and physical discomfort that is not actually caused by bodily injury, but is a physical manifestation of the panic and fear that the heliophobic person experiences when exposed to light. This physical pain may be expressed, for example, as a phantom sensation of their skin burning under direct sunlight, even when it is visually apparent that their skin is not actually burning any more than healthy skin would as a result of sun exposure, but nonetheless still feels like real pain for the sufferer. However, other differential diagnoses like the rare genetic defect erythropoietic protoporphyria characterized by a severe burning sensation of all exposed skin areas without leading to immediate visible signs have to be excluded. Causes Phobias are classified as a type of anxiety disorder. There is often no discernible cause of phobia onset, though Rachman describes three possibilities: classical conditioning, vicarious acquisition and informational/instructional acquisition. Occasionally they are triggered by harmful events surrounding the phobic object or situation - in this case, for example, severe sunburn, chronic light-triggered migraines, or trauma accompanied by bright sunlight. According to the DSM-5, heliophobia would be listed under the category of \\"specific phobia\\". The Pacific Health Center suggested that people have been staying away from the sunlight because of growing fear of skin cancer or blindness. This is not technically heliophobia, but simply an unfounded illogical solution. It includes an intense fear of being harmfully affected by exposure to the sun or to bright lights, can also cause heliophobia. Forms of heliophobia based on such fears can cause the sufferer to eventually develop fear of being in public or fear of people in general by association, as a crippling fear of bright light can significantly limit the places a heliophobe can comfortably visit, as well as prevent that person from going outside during the daytime, when most other people are active. Other medical conditions such as keratoconus (an eye disorder that results in extreme optic sensitivity to sunlight and bright lights), migraine which can be triggered by bright light, and porphyria cutanea tarda, which causes the skin to be overly sensitive to sunlight to the point of causing blisters, can result in heliophobia if the sufferer begins to associate pain and discomfort with bright lights. Effects Sufferers may cover themselves with long, protective clothing or carry a sun parasol when going outdoors during the daytime, or simply never go outdoors at all when the sun is out, depending on the severity of the fear. Since sufferers stay indoors more than non-sufferers, it will make them more prone to becoming vitamin D deficient, as well as depression caused by a combination of vitamin D deficiency, isolation and feelings of alienation from other people, and a continuously dark environment. However, a vitamin deficiency can be helped by taking vitamin D supplements or by consuming vitamin D fortified foods. Treatment Heliophobia can be treated using talk therapy, exposure therapy, self-help techniques, support groups, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and relaxation techniques. For people who are severely heliophobic, anti-anxiety meditation is a recommended mode of treatment.  In culture  * Heliophobia was considered a \\"tell-tale sign\\" of stereotypical vampires and other fantasy creatures such as werewolves, ghosts, orcs, etc. * There was a short-lived magazine Heliophobe (three issues, 1994‚Äì1996), described as \\"a not-so-sexual fetish magazine exclusively devoted to pale-skinned women\\".Heliophobe magazine webpage * Heliophobe is the title of a 1997 album from German rock band Scumbucket.Scumbucket albums * Heliophobia is the fifth song from the album \\"Days of Summer Gone\\" from Chris. * This phobia is seen in the American sports comedy film The Benchwarmers.

Volume 1: Alternate Empires, edited by Gregory Benford. The short story was reprinted in Niven's collection N-Space, as well as the Robert A. Heinlein retrospective Requiem. Plot summary The point-of-view character, a physicist with a time-travel theory, is approached by retired Senator William Proxmire. Proxmire has come up with a scheme to abolish such money-wasters (as Proxmire views them) as space travel. His plan is simple; many of those who worked for or advocated space travel cited the science fiction of Robert A. Heinlein as their inspiration. However, the iconic writer only began his career after being discharged from the United States Navy due to tuberculosis. If a time traveler were to cure Heinlein, he would presumably remain in the military and this impact on history would be negated. Sure enough, the scheme is carried out. However, Proxmire finds out that he has not succeeded as well as he would have liked. Although Heinlein's absence from the literary world of the new timeline did neutralize the science fiction magazines of the 1950s, other authors took Heinlein's place just a decade later ‚Äì in mainstream literary magazines such as The New Yorker. Science fiction thus gained an air of respectability, and inspired people to even greater achievements. Proxmire's political career ended when this culture of science fiction fans boycotted Wisconsin cheese in response to his Golden Fleece Awards. The new timeline is far more technologically advanced; solar power satellites can be seen in the night sky, a lunar colony exists, and a mission to Mars is underway. The healthy Heinlein turned out to be as skilled an officer as he would have been an author, and is now an admiral with great influence over an equally healthy space program ‚Äì he denies the Russians spacecraft, but has placed a number of cosmonauts on the Mars mission as payment for fusion bombs to be used in the ship's ORION drive.

The Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) is the United States Army's current combat helmet, used since the mid-2000s. It was developed by the United States Army Soldier Systems Center, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to be the next generation of protective combat helmets for use by the American ground forces. The ACH is derived from the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet. The ACH is currently in the process of being phased out and replaced by the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH), an improvement upon the ACH derived from its design. And later being replaced by the Integrated Head Protection System.  History  4th Infantry Division soldier wearing an ACH helmet in the MultiCam pattern. =2000s= The Advanced Combat Helmet was first fielded beginning in 2002Some sources report that the helmet was first fielded in 2003. in limited numbers to eventually replace the PASGT helmet. In 2006, 102,000 helmets were ordered from ArmorSource, of which 99,000 were delivered when the contract was fulfilled and properly closed. In 2007, the Army introduced a ballistic \\"nape pad\\" that attaches to the ACH's rear suspension system. Of these, 430,000 were to be issued in the Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI). Beginning in 2008, the Army's Program Executive Office Soldier outfitted soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division and 4th Infantry Division bound for Iraq with helmet-mounted sensors designed to gather data on head injuries (or traumatic brain injuries) caused during IED detonations. The data collected will help with the design of improvements to the MICH's suspension and chin strap systems. In May 2009, 55,000 of these were in storage and 44,000 were in use U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel. The 44,000 helmets in use by service members were recalled by the U.S. Army in May 2010 due to potentially defective materials being used. No proof of defective materials was ever established nor evidence of any wrongdoing by the contractor. In May 2009, 34,218 ACHs made by the Gentex Corporation were recalled. Certain screws attaching the chinstrap and other parts to the helmet did not conform to specifications in the contract. The screws failed ballistics tests at extreme temperatures. Gentex alleges its subcontractor had fabricated compliance certificates for the screws. A MultiCam cover for the Advanced Combat Helmet began fielding in late 2009 for soldiers deployed in Afghanistan. =2010s= On March 7, 2016, Armorsource LLC agreed to pay $3 million to settle False Claims Act allegations. Revision was awarded a contract for the ACH II contract. The ACH and Lightweight Helmets will eventually be replaced by the Enhanced Combat Helmet.  Design  The shape of the ACH is virtually identical to the MICH TC-2000. Compared to the PASGT helmet, the front brow is eliminated to improve upwards visibility and allow easier mounting of night-vision goggle brackets. The side brim has been raised to the point that the entire lower brim of the helmet is \\"flat\\" compared to the PASGT which curves upwards at the back. This is to allow greater compatibility with communications headsets and improve hearing when headsets are not used. The ACH uses ballistic fiber such as kevlar and twaron. In 2007, the Army developed and introduced a ballistic \\"nape pad\\" that attaches to the ACH's rear suspension system and coincided with the introduction of the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV). The pad reduces soldier deaths from fragmentation wounds to the neck and lower head. Lightweight Advanced Combat Helmet The Lightweight Advanced Combat Helmet Generation II (LW-ACH Gen II) weighs one pound less than the original ACH while offering the same ballistic protection.Army Vice Chief Focused on Lighter Soldier Kit - Kitup.Military.com, 29 June 2015 This is being used for the basis of the Lightweight Helmet.

Renaissance was started by Geoff Oakes at Venue 44 in Mansfield, England in March 1992. Renaissance was Geoff Oakes' antidote to the sci-fi imagery and dressed down clubbers of the 'rave' scene. Early resident DJs at Renaissance were Ian Ossia, Sasha, John Digweed and Nigel Dawson; other DJs with long-time attachments include Dave Seaman, Nick Warren, David Morales, Anthony Pappa and Hern√°n Catt√°neo. In 1993, Renaissance moved to a newly renovated former print works in Derby called The Conservatory. The Conservatory was only just finished in time for opening of Renaissance on the Saturday night but was decorated with the (by then) signature gold cherubs and velvet drapes which have become indicative of the opulent style of Renaissance events. In 1995, Renaissance put on their first international show at Womb in Tokyo. Other international dates soon followed, and in 2007, Renaissance hosted over 150 shows in more than 25 countries around the world. The Renaissance monthly residency at the Cross nightclub in London was one of the longest running continuous club nights in the world, and ended in November 2007 when the venue closed permanently to make way for new development. They are known for their use of classical imagery in their packaging and advertising. Renaissance is also renowned for their special shows in stately homes and castles, including Shugborough Hall, Allerton Castle, and several others around the UK. In late June 2007, Renaissance hosted \\"Wild in the Country\\" at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire. The event featured the only summer appearance in the UK of the electronic band Underworld, as well as a lengthy DJ set by Sasha and John Digweed. Other major artists on the line up included Hot Chip, Fran√ßois K, and Ricardo Villalobos. Renaissance has also been resident during the summer season in Ibiza for more than 15 years, and has played on the Spanish island in venues such as Pacha, Privilege, and Amnesia. In early 2010, Renaissance ceased operations and entered into administration. Ministry of Sound acquired the copyrights to the Renaissance brand, although under MOS ownership the brand was not active until recently. In July 2011, original founder Geoff Oakes once again took control of the brand and both the label and events are now fully operational again. A series of special events and record releases to celebrate Renaissance's 20th Anniversary was announced in 2012. In late 2018, a controlling stake in the promotion and associated record label was acquired by media and finance entrepreneur, Scott Rudmann. Rudmann had been a small shareholder of the company since 2000, was formerly a non-executive director of the company, and had remained close with Geoff Oakes over many years. Beginning in 2018, Renaissance's event calendar began again, with the promotion staging events in Birmingham, United Kingdom with artists including Tale of Us, Sasha, Dixon, Solomun, and Amelie Lens. In January 2020, Renaissance made its debut in Tulum, Mexico, at leading Tulum outdoor venue Zamna, with a groundbreaking line up including artists who had ever performed in Tulum previously, among them Adam Beyer, Ida Endberg, Charlotee DeWitte, Danny Tenaglia, Nicole Moudaber, Dubfire, Blancah, and Sirsax. The promotion has announced a return to Zamna, Tulum in January 2021. Record label Renaissance has an associated record label which has featured releases from artists such as John Digweed, Sasha, Dave Seaman, Hernan Cattaneo, David Morales, Faithless, Satoshi Tomiie, James Zabiela and BT. Sasha and John Digweed met while resident DJs at Renaissance. Two years into their Renaissance residencies, they produced their first mix album, Renaissance - The Mix Collection Volume 1, which was released on the club's label 1993. This 3-CD set became the first mix compilation to achieve gold record status.

Life and career Henry Holt was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 3, 1840.\\" He graduated from Yale University in 1862. After a year at Columbia Law School he married Mary Florence West and left school for work. He joined the publishing company of Frederick Leypoldt in 1866, which became Henry Holt and Company in 1873. Holt's company specialized in publishing and did not sell books at retail. He remained active in the company until about 1916. Seven years after his wife's death, he wed Florence Taber. Holt had 3 sons and 3 daughters. His son Roland Holt married famed dramatist Constance D'Arcy Mackay. In 1905, Henry Holt's daughters Edith and Winifred co-founded the New York Association for the Blind, now known as Lighthouse International. Edith continued to be active with this charity, which provided the opportunity for blind people to do useful work. In response to critics she wrote \\"Some went as far as to say that it would be cruel to add to the burden of infirmity the burden of labor, as if to be without work were not the heaviest burden mortal could be called upon to endure.\\" In 1914 Holt founded The Unpopular Review, later renamed The Unpartizan Review, which ceased publication in 1920. Holt also authored novels. Both Calire (1892) and Sturmsee: Man and Man (1905) were first published anonymously and then reissued under his name. The New York Times described them: \\"In Sturmsee the economic problems of the present day are treated in an interesting fashion. The theory of 'social service' is set forth in it., and there are many satirical touches. The scope of the other novel, Calmire, is somewhat broader.\\"The entrance to Henry Holt's crypt at The Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY Holt served on the Simplified Spelling Board, and was its President and the man to whom the Board's founding benefactor Andrew Carnegie addressed his 25 February 1915 letter expressing dissatisfaction with the progress of the board, saying of the board that \\"a more useless body of men never came into association, judging from the effects they produce.\\"Carnegie, Andrew. \\"My views about Improved Spelling 1906-1915\\", Columbia University, Brander Matthews' Manuscript Collection, 893 Holt published his autobiography, Garrulities of an Octogenarian Editor in 1923.Kessinger Publishing, 2005, He died at his home in New York City on February 13, 1926 and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.

A portion of the site (which is unmarked with a sign or other informational marker) comprises a natural area located at the edge of campus, near a parking lot. At one time this site had a natural spring, and the location is sometimes referred to as Puvunga Spring. Another similar (but larger) Tongva site is Kuruvungna Springs on the grounds of University High School in Los Angeles.  History  Since the 1960s the Tongva people have sought to preserve the Puvunga site from development, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 . However, the university has challenged this designation, claiming they were not consulted when the application was filed. Ethnohistoric evidence clearly identifies Puvungna with Rancho Los Alamitos, a portion of which became the Cal State Long Beach campus. More than a dozen archaeological sites spread over an area of about on and near the campus have been identified as Puvungna village sites. Most of these have been destroyed by development. In 1972, campus workmen uncovered portions of an Indian burial on one of these sites, LAn-235, located on the western edge of campus. These remains were placed in CSULB's archaeology lab. A few years later, LAn-235 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places to \\"represent\\" Puvungna \\"as a means of perpetuating the memory of these native peoples and their religion, and as an aid to the program of public education.\\" Two other sites were included in the National Register: the adjacent LAn-234 and LAn-306, located just east of campus on the grounds of the historic Rancho Los Alamitos. In 1992, when the university began its first attempts to build a strip mall on this last undeveloped portion of the campus, the Tongva people initiated protests and filed a lawsuit which has temporarily stalled any construction. The site remains as an undeveloped grassy area with a few trees. External links *The California Cultural Resources Preservation Alliance Inc.

He played as a for the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL, and for the Wigan Warriors, Salford City Reds and Hull F.C. in the Super League. Background Paleaaesina was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He was educated at Penrose High School (now One Tree Hill College) in Auckland. Career He started playing rugby league at the age of nine with New Zealand club Otahuhu Leopards. He made his National Rugby League (NRL) d√©but with the New Zealand Warriors against Northern Eagles in June 2001, and went on to become one of the club's most effective performers. Before his NRL debut, he had previously played for Papatoetoe in the Auckland competition, and Hibiscus Coast Raiders in the Bartercard Cup. Paleaaesina played for the Junior Kiwis in 2001, and the Kiwis in 2005. Wigan Warriors In June 2005 he signed a three-year deal to play for Wigan Warriors, starting in 2006. Recently arrived Wigan Warriors coach Ian Millward commented: \\"This is a great signing for us. He will add size and pace to our pack for next year and he is only 22 years of age.\\" Paleaaesina said: \\"It's a great thrill to be joining Wigan and my good friend Jerry Seu Seu. I had several offers but Wigan is still the biggest name down here and it will be a thrill to play for them.\\" Iafeta Paleaaesina impressed on his league d√©but for the Wigan Warriors scoring a try in the opening 2006 Super League XI match against the Catalans Dragons. Paleaaesina also scored again in Wigan Warriors' 36‚Äì20 victory over the Huddersfield Giants on 24 February 2006. He was one of the best players for Wigan Warriors in the 2006 Super League season despite damaging his calf muscle in a game against the Warrington Wolves. His return from injury was against the Huddersfield Giants on 22 April 2006 which Wigan Warriors won 46‚Äì14. Iafeta Paleaaesina played a key role in Wigan Warriors: 2007 squad making a noticeable impact to their performances. Although his surname is often written with an apostrophe in the middle (between the 2 letter \\"a\\"s), this is incorrect. When the player first arrived at Wigan Warriors, he was handed his playing shirt with his name on it, and he returned it, stating that the spelling was incorrect. A new one was produced, minus the apostrophe, which he was happy with. On 4 October 2007 the RLIF gave permission for Paleaaesina to represent Samoa at the 2008 Rugby League World Cup rather than New Zealand who he had previously represented in international matches. He qualified to play for Samoa due to his Samoan heritage. He played in the 2010 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford.

He did a great deal to popularise roses among British gardeners. He was known for his flamboyant appearance and opinions.  Early life  Wheatcroft was born at 23 Handel Street, Sneinton, Nottingham, the younger son of George Alfred Wheatcroft (b. 1862/3), a journeyman stonemason and builder, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Wood. They were dedicated members of the Independent Labour Party, whose leaders visited the modest family home, and on many occasions the young Harry sat on Keir Hardie's knee. Wheatcroft attended schools in Nottingham and also the Ecole Camille Desmoulins at Saint-Quentin, France, where he became fluent in French. After working in a lace factory and a motor firm he was conscripted in 1916, despite having claimed registration as a conscientious objector. He was court-martialled for disobedience and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs. Diagnosed with tuberculosis, however, he was released after serving one year to convalesce at a Quaker health home.  Post-World War I  Wheatcroft considered whether to enter politics or join his brother Alfred as a market gardener. The politician James Maxton guided him into horticulture, saying 'You'll bring beauty into the world. Politics is a very dirty business' . The horticultural firm of Wheatcroft Brothers was established in 1919, with a bicycle as the only means of transport, and in 1920 roses became a speciality. Alfred managed the business and Harry was the salesman, often away looking for custom and attending horticultural shows. This worked well because the two never got on, Alfred being misanthropic and Harry outgoing. In 1927 they introduced the Princess Elizabeth rose to honour the royal baby; it was the first of many public relations successes. For the rest of his career Wheatcroft sought and won media attention. He grew into a striking figure, tall and slender until he filled out in middle age, with a pleasing gruff voice and a gift for witty repartee. He cultivated flowing hair and whiskers, finding them \\"more convenient to grow... than to waste valuable time shaving them off.\\"  Married life  On 15 June 1929 Wheatcroft married Dorothy, known as Doss (1905‚Äì1999) the daughter of John Averill, a wealthy Tamworth farmer. She was a gymnast and dietician. Under her influence Wheatcroft became mainly vegetarian and his health improved. They lived at the nursery in Gedling, Nottingham, in a custom built Gypsy caravan, arousing curiosity when they took it to the shows. In winter Wheatcroft used a motor cycle when seeking wholesale outlets for unsold plants. He visited breeders in Spain and France, using his linguistic skill, and returned with rose varieties for future introduction. Wheatcroft's marketing of some of those plants might suggest that the firm had originated them, but in truth they had minimal success as rose breeders. In 1935 their launch of Herbert Robinson's Phyllis Gold and Christopher Stone with unprecedented publicity surprised the British rose world. Such vigorous salesmanship was something new. On the outbreak of World War II Wheatcrofts had 600,000 roses 'about four feet high and in full flower. It appeared there was only one course we could take, which was to destroy our trees and convert the land for food production'. They became instead successful producers of vegetables and breeders of pigs and cattle. After the war Wheatcroft contacted Francois Meilland of Lyons, whose rose, Peace, the sensation of the time, he introduced to Britain in 1948.  Success as a rose grower  In 1952 he secured another coup, by introducing Queen Elizabeth from the USA. In 1953 Wheatcrofts sought to register eleven rose names as trademarks, to give them a monopoly over Meilland's creations. In the Chancery Division, 'With his Dundreary whiskers, his mane of black hair, his suit of black-and-white check ... the Nottingham rose king made as picturesque a figure this week as the Law Courts have seen' He made the judge laugh, lost the case, but reckoned the publicity well worth the ¬£2000 costs. Wheatcroft displayed brilliant showmanship with two German Roses. Super Star, exhibited in London before the name had been agreed, appeared as 'the Great Unnamed Seedling.' And he made Fragrant Cloud the talking point of the National Rose Society's autumn show in 1963 by filling a bowl with its wonderfully scented petals. The acquisition of these varieties, with Peace and Queen Elizabeth, are Wheatcroft's enduring achievements, a tribute to his energy, good rose judgment, and entrepreneurial skills. Also remembered for his TV advertising of Acta-Bacta plant nutrient in the 1960s  Split with Alfred Wheatcroft  In 1962, when longstanding strained relationships with his brother came to a head, Wheatcroft joined his sons in a rival firm, which bought out the older company to become the Wheatcroft Organization. With capable young family members running the day-to- day business (never his strong suit) Wheatcroft gave his publicity skills free rein. His whiskers and dress became more bizarre. Out of a huge maroon Rolls Royce would appear his tall, gangling figure. Clad in a floral shirt with royal-blue trousers flecked with colour, or perhaps in a suit of dogtooth tweed trimmed with tangerine velvet, against which his horn-rimmed spectacles swung wildly from a string. He captivated photographers, the media, and the gardening public. Show reports carried his picture even when his firm's participation had been minimal. He travelled the world, lectured extensively, and wrote books, and his television appearances included a commercial advertising cheese. During this period Wheatcroft committed a social indiscretion at the Royal Horticultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show by staging roses without a shirt on. It has been recounted that the president, Lord Aberconway, approached: 'A hot day, Harry!' 'Indeed, my lord.' 'Tell you what, Harry, if you'll put a shirt on, I'll take my jacket off!' The society honoured him in 1972 with the Victoria Medal of Honour, and in 1973 he was awarded the Royal National Rose Society's Dean Hole medal. Wheatcroft's prosperity and enjoyment of life's good things never blunted his sometimes naive expression of left-wing views. He offended a Texan audience by declaring that America might not be embroiled in the Vietnam combat if more Americans grew roses. Yet on attending the May Day parade in Moscow's Red Square, he admiringly described the militarism on display as awe-inspiring. Personal life At home he was a quiet, even subdued family man, happy with his five children though with little time to spend with them, for they attended boarding school, and summer holidays coincided with shows. His wife, Doss, was infuriated by a string of infidelities; he shrugged them off, maintaining that yielding to temptation is natural.Wheatcroft, Root of the Platter, 4r In the 1960s, he named a red rose for his wife, and a flamboyant red and yellow rose bore his own name in 1972. Wheatcroft's niece, Anna Wheatcroft, was married to future Doctor Who star Tom Baker from 1961 to 1966. They had two children, Daniel and Piers. In his book, Who on Earth is Tom Baker?, Baker revealed that the rest of the Wheatcroft family treated him very cruelly during his marriage to Anna. Death Having suffered a stroke, Wheatcroft died in Nottingham General Hospital on 8 January 1977. Wheatcroft Garden Centre, in Edwalton in Nottingham, is now operated by Notcutts Ltd.

One of three known caffeinated holly trees, the leaves of the guayusa tree are dried and brewed like a tea for their stimulative effects. Description Ilex guayusa is an evergreen dioecious tree which grows tall. The leaves are ovate, elliptic, oblong or lanceolate; long, wide; with serrate or dentate margin. The flowers are small and white, arranged in thyrses. The fruit is spherical and red, in diameter.  Distribution and habitat  I. guayusa is native to the upper Amazonian regions of Ecuador, Peru, and southern Colombia, between of elevation. However, it has also been collected in Bolivia in 1939. It is present in evergreen or deciduous premontane forests, especially ones dominated by Dictyocaryum palms. Guayusa has been collected only rarely in the wild by botanists and is known almost exclusively as a cultivated plant (especially in the Ecuadorian provinces of Napo and Pastaza).  Ecology  285x285pxThis species is found wild and cultivated in sandy-loamy soils of pH 4.34‚Äì5.01 with low cation-exchange capacity and high metal content. The vegetation type preferred is lowland and premontane, neotropical jungle where conditions of soil, precipitation and humidity are appropriate for its development. Despite being a monoecious species and prone to floral polygamy, Ilex guayusa appears to yield little fertile material, so it relies mostly on asexual reproduction (basal shoots, sprouts and suckers). In its initial growth stages, Ilex guayusa behaves as an understory species, becoming a shrub with spreading branches when it receives higher amounts of light, eventually becoming a tree.  History  The earliest evidence of human utilization of this species is a 1,500-year-old bundle of guayusa leaves found in a medicine man's tomb in the Bolivian Andes, far beyond the natural range of the plant. Father Juan Lorenzo Lucero reported in 1683 the daily consumption of guayusa in infusions by the Jivaroan peoples. In the 18th century, several missionaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru wrote about the uses of the plant, and some of them also consumed the infusion citing digestive and stimulant properties. The Jesuits knew about the medicinal uses of the plant and traded it actively. A grove found in 1857 by Richard Spruce near the town of Ba√±os, Ecuador was supposedly cultivated since precolumbian times.  Vernacular names  Spanish: guayusa Kichwa: waisa Shuar: wayus, waisleft Uses Leaves of Ilex guayusa are used to make an infusion, especially in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. After harvest, leaves are dried, which allows flavor to develop. Jivaroan peoples in Ecuador and Peru, also prepare a drink from the leaves to be drunk in large amounts during pre- dawn ceremonies that involve the vomiting of the excess drink to wash out the stomach and small intestine and avoid absorbing too much caffeine. A ritual use by the Kichua people involves drinking guayusa infusion to have foretelling dreams for successful hunting expeditions. Guayusa is also consumed in parties and local festivals as a social drink, especially by the Kichua people in Ecuador. In the three aforementioned countries, guayusa is used in the preparation of artisanal alcoholic drinks. Chemical composition Dried leaves of Ilex guayusa.Guayusa leaves contain caffeine (1.73‚Äì3.48 %), theobromine and other dimethylxanthines (among them paraxanthine and theophylline). Guayusa leaves also contain L-theanine, gallic acid, guanidine, isobutyric acid, nicotinic acid, ascorbic acid, riboflavin, choline, pyridoxine, triterpenes, chlorogenic acid and sugars among other compounds.

However, Jackman never played for the first team although he did spend two loan spells; the first at Cambridge United, the second at Stockport County. Young Jackman had clearly made an impression at Stockport as they snapped him up in the middle of his loan spell for a fee of ¬£70,000 in the 2003/04 season. Over the next season and a half, Jackman made 54 league appearances (9 as a substitute) scoring 5 goals. =Gillingham= At the beginning of the 2005‚Äì06 season Jackman joined recently relegated League One side Gillingham. After a difficult start, during which the entire team struggled for results, Jackman found himself playing in the left wing position as well as the left back position. Following the departure of Tom Williams to Swansea City in January 2006, Jackman found himself reverting to his favoured left-back position and his performances improved towards the end of the season, leading to him finishing as the runner-up in the club's Player of the Year awards and being voted players' player of the year. He was awarded the \\"goal of the season\\" for 2006‚Äì07 for a goal at home to Brentford. =Northampton Town= He was offered a new contract with the Kent club but instead opted to sign for Northampton Town on 23 May 2007.Jackman to become a Cobbler Official Northampton Town Website After a fine first season with the club Jackman was voted the player of the year for the 2007‚Äì08 season.Danny Jackman signs contract extension Cobblers Mad He signed a one-year contract extension with the club on 24 July 2008.Jackman signs new Cobblers deal BBC Sport Jackman has scored several goals in the 2008‚Äì09 season after being handed free-kick duties by Northampton manager Stuart Gray.

The Tyneside Electrics were the suburban railways on Tyneside that the North Eastern Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway electrified using the third rail system. The North Tyneside loop was electrified from 1904 onwards and formed one of the earliest suburban electric networks; the South Tyneside line to South Shields via Pelaw was electrified in March 1938. British Railways converted these lines to diesel operation in the 1960s: the line to South Shields in January 1963 and the North Tyneside lines in June 1967 when the electrical supply infrastructure (which dated from 1935) and the rolling stock (which dated from 1937) had become life expired. In addition, the system was losing passengers and suffering from costly vandalism. Since the late 1970s, much of the system has been converted to form the Tyne and Wear Metro. Routes The original lines covered were the North Tyneside Loop from Newcastle Central via Wallsend, North Shields, Whitley Bay and South Gosforth back to Newcastle; the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from Newcastle Central to Benton (providing a short cut to Monkseaton and Whitley Bay), and the Riverside Branch from Byker to Percy Main via . At Benton the electrified lines diverged from the ECML to join the Blyth and Tyne line (see below). These curved lines were called the South West Curve and South East Curve based on their disposition looking north. The SE Curve had scheduled electric services running over it from time to time, but the SW Curve was used for empty stock movements. In 1923 the triangular junctions at South Gosforth were electrified in connection with opening of the new car sheds, but were used only for empty stock movements. In the same year, a route was electrified in the Heaton area. This route left the ECML at Benton Bank and ran through the freight yard at Heaton to connect with the Tynemouth lines at Heaton East Junction. It was used for empty stock movements and as an access route to Walker Gate Carriage Works where heavy repairs and overhaul of the electric stock took place. This route was called the \\"Heaton Independent Lines\\". Finally, a short freight-only line, the Newcastle Quayside Branch left the Tynemouth lines just east of Manors East station at Trafalgar South yard, opposite Argyle Street signal box, and emerged after traversing through three tunnels into the Quayside yard adjacent to the quayside at Newcastle. This route was equipped with both overhead line and conductor rail to enable electric operation in June 1905. =Map= Diagram of the network at its maximum extent during 1938-63. History =History before electrification= The line through Jesmond, Benton and on to Tynemouth was opened in the 1860s by the Blyth and Tyne Railway (B&T;), and the line through Wallsend by the Newcastle and North Shields Railway in 1839. The portion of the East Coast Main Line to Benton had been opened by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway in the 1840s. The Newcastle Quayside Branch had been opened by the NER in 1873, and the Riverside Branch in 1879. The junctions at South Gosforth dated back to 1905 and were laid for the Gosforth and Ponteland Branch. =Electrification= In the early 1900s, tramway competition caused a large and rapid decline in the number of passengers using the North Eastern Railway's local services in the north Tyneside area. The number of passengers using these services declined from 9,847,000 in 1901, to 5,887,000 in 1903. In 1903, in response to this, and in an effort to win back the lost passengers, the NER decided to electrify their suburban network north of the River Tyne with a 600 V DC third-rail system. They hired the electrical engineer Charles H. Merz as a consultative engineer for the project, and contracted the British Thomson-Houston company to supply the electrical equipment. The North Tyneside Loop, including the Riverside Branch, and a short stretch of the East Coast Main Line was electrified in stages between February and July 1904. The original electrified route was not quite a loop however, as the northern leg of the route ran over the former Blyth and Tyne Railway, whose Newcastle terminus was at ; an isolated terminus with no rail connection to Newcastle Central, meaning services initially ran from Newcastle Central via Tynemouth to New Bridge Street. In 1909, New Bridge Street was closed, and a connection was constructed to an extended station, in order to create a full loop, however despite this. it was not until 1917 that a full Central to Central loop service began. The electrified stretch of the East Coast Main Line between Heaton and Benton Junction was used by certain limited stop 'express' services between Newcastle and the coast. The electrification, and the improved service it enabled, succeeded in the aim of reversing the decline in passengers numbers, which rose steadily, and topped the ten million mark in 1913, exceeding the highest pre-electrification totals. It also substantially reduced the running cost of the service, which was reduced to less than half the cost per train mile of the steam service it replaced. In 1923 the NER was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Electrification of the South Tyneside line from Newcastle to was announced by the LNER in 1935 and electric services began in the spring of 1938. =Decline and de- electrification= Falling passenger numbers, rising costs, and the need to renew life expired infrastructure and rolling stock, meant that the Tyneside Electric network was de-electrified in the 1960s under British Rail, and converted to diesel operation. The Newcastle-South Shields line was de- electrified in 1963, and the north Tyneside routes were de-electrified in 1967. =Successor= In the late-1970s much of the former Tyneside Electric network was incorporated, in modified form, into the Tyne and Wear Metro: The North Tyneside Loop (minus the Riverside Branch which was closed in 1973), plus the South Shields branch was incorporated into the Metro. A new underground section under Newcastle and Gateshead and new bridges were added, part of the former Ponteland Branch was also included, and the network was re- electrified with overhead lines. Rolling stock =North Eastern Railway= Preserved 1904 NER electric Motor Parcel Van No. 3267 in the Stephenson Railway Museum The North Eastern Railway began using electric multiple units between and on 29 March 1904 and from 25 July 1904 over the entire route from Newcastle Central via Percy Main to Tynemouth, returning to New Bridge Street via Jesmond. The railway was electrified with a third rail at 600 V DC. One hundred electric multiple unit cars, built in NER's York workshop, were equipped by British Thompson-Houston (BTH) with BTH and Westinghouse equipment. Two motor parcels vans were used with passenger coaches on workman's trains. In 1909-15 an additional 11 motor cars and 11 trailers were built. On Sunday 11 August 1918 there was a serious fire at the original car shed at Walkergate, which completely destroyed 34 cars and damaged many more. An order for 35 replacement cars was placed and these were built between 1920 and 1922. These were to a different design, with elliptical roofline and more powerful motors. a powered parcels van built in 1904 is in the National Railway Museum collection and on loan to the Stephenson Railway Museum. This fire affected rolling stock policy for the rest of the life of the system through to 1967. When the original cars were life-expired in the 1930s, the replacement cars were not, so while new LNER units were built to replace all the stock then in use, the replacement cars were moved on to the newly electrified South Shields line, whose commissioning in 1938 coincided with the arrival of the new LNER stock. In turn, this meant the replacement cars were life-expired in the 1950s, when what was standard electric stock of the time, to the Southern Region pattern with separate compartments, quite different (and to some extent inappropriate) with what had existed before was built. In the early 1960s, the ability to redeploy this quite recent stock to the Southern Region was a significant part of the decision to de-electrify the South Shields line, which they had been principally employed on, leaving the north side lines to run on with the LNER units until they too were life expired some years later and the electric system was closed down. =London and North Eastern Railway= A 1937 LNER unit at Newcastle Central in 1950. The NER stock remained in service with the LNER after the 1923 grouping. In 1937 the newest ex-NER stock, built in 1920 to replace those vehicles lost in the 1918 fire, was refurbished for use on the newly electrified South Tyneside line. The other NER stock, some of which dated back to 1903‚Äì04 was replaced on the North Tyneside lines by new articulated units built by Metropolitan Cammell. =British Railways= The LNER 1937 stock remained in service with British Railways (BR) after nationalisation in 1948. In 1955 BR introduced new stock on the South Tyneside line based on the Southern Region 2‚ÄìEPB stock and was designated \\"South Tyneside 1951 Stock\\". They were electrically identical to the 2‚ÄìEPB but the body on the motor brake cars had a much larger luggage space to accommodate prams. Minor detail differences were route indicating lights and destination blinds. The 1920 stock was withdrawn and was broken up at Simonside Wagon Works near Tyne Dock in the period 1956‚Äì58, although some vehicles were retained for departmental use or saw further service as \\"Pram Vans\\". 2‚ÄìEPB train at Newcastle Central in 1960. When the South Tyneside line was de-electrified in January 1963, all but one of the 1951 EPB stock was transferred to the Southern Region. The exception was Motor Parcels Van E68000 which was transferred to the London Midland Region's Liverpool ‚Äî Southport line, renumbered M68000 and used for another five years before being withdrawn in 1968. It thus had a service life of just 12 years ‚Äì less than half of its capital life in financial terms.

Again, in April 2006, during CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao's visit to the United States, she used her journalist pass to gain access to a White House lawn press briefing.\\"China and Its President Greeted by a Host of Indignities\\", Dana Milbank, The Washington Post, Friday, 21 April 2006; Page A02 She unfurled protest banners and loudly shouted for over two minutes, by some accounts, during a speech given by Chinese leader. She shouted comments such as \\"President Bush, stop him from killing\\" or \\"President Hu, your days are numbered\\". Secret Service ushered Wang away from the media platform. Wang's attorney stated that there was no evidence Hu heard the statements uttered, claiming that the scuffles to take away her banner and the attempt to silence her could have caused Hu to pause in his remarks. CNN and BBC feeds of Hu's visit were interrupted by state censors in China, blacking out the protester's action. The Epoch Times reported that Wang helped research articles on organ harvesting at Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital. She was \\"very overstressed,\\" Epoch Times said, \\"When she saw Bush shake the hand of the Chinese leader, she felt obligated to speak out\\".

The Varduli were a pre-Roman tribeJohn James Van Nostrand Jr, The reorganization of Spain by Augustus\\" University of California Publications in History 4, 1916:122ff settled in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, in what today is the eastern region of the autonomous community of the Basque Country and western Navarre, in northern Spain. Their historical territory corresponds with current Basque- speaking areas, however it is debated whether the Varduli were actually Aquitanians, related to the Vascones,Localizaci√≥n de algunas ciudades v√°rdulas citadas por Mela y Ptolomeo Ildefonso Gurruchaga or if they were Celts, related to tribes such as the Cantabri and CeltiberiansEl puerto romano de Irun Mercedes Urteaga and which later underwent Basquisation.Ethnic map of the Iberian Peninsula after the Second Punic War  Etymology  Their ethnonym Varduli is connected with an area that is referred to in documents from the early Middle Ages as Bardulia, which is identified as the cradle of Old Castile. Julio Caro Baroja, a Spanish anthropologist and linguist declared on his works that the term Varduli does not have a Basque origin.Caro Baroja, Julio. Los pueblos de Espa√±a, 1976.  History  The Varduli are mentioned for the first time during Roman times, by Strabo, who called them Bardyetai, and placed them in the Basque coast, between the Cantabri and Vascones; they are also mentioned by the geographer Ptolemy, who placed them roughly in present-day Gipuzkoa, and by Roman historians, notably Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia,\\"In Cluniensem conventum Varduli ducunt populos xiiii\\" (Pliny iii.26); \\"A Pyranaeo per oceanum Vasconum saltus, Olarso, Vardulorum oppida...\\" iv.110.. where he reported that Amanum Portus (Roman name: Flaviobriga), present-day Castro Urdiales, was a Varduli city. The Roman geographer Pomponius Mela located them also in the coast, west of the Vascones and east of the Caristii. This lack of agreement about their exact position may have been caused by the continuous movement of the tribes of the northern Iberian Peninsula during events such as the Cantabrian Wars. The first census of the Varduli population took place under the orders of Augustus.CIL vi, 1463, noted by Van Nostrand 1916:123. According to Pliny the ElderBook III, 26, 27, Book IV, 110http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/es/foto/mu-36529/, the main Vardulian city was TulloniumBook III, 26, 27, Book IV, 110, that was in the Zadorra (modern name) river basin, on a main Roman road from Virovesca, capital of the Autrigones, to Pompaelo (Pamplona or Iru√±a) in Vasconian land. According to several Classical antiquity authors such as Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder and Pomponius Melahttp://aunamendi.eusko- ikaskuntza.eus/es/foto/mu-36529/ other Vardulian cities were Alba and Gebala (today's Guevara), in the inland; while Tritium Tuboricum, a little west of the Deba river (Deva, Deua or Deba = Goddess), Menosca and Morogi or Morosgi, were on the Atlantic coast (on the south coast of the Bay of Biscay). In 114 BC, Gaius Marius had a personal guard made by Varduli people, who were called Barduaio√≠ slaves in Rome. By the year 44, and according to Pomponius Mela, the Varduli inhabited lands close to the Pyrenees and composed a united society. The defeat of the Cantabri against Augustus did not have any effect on the Varduli, as they had not joined the wars. The Varduli served in cohorts in the province of Britannia: Varduli are mentioned in an inscription on a Roman altar at Rochester, (Roman Bremenium) and at Milecastle 19 along Hadrian's Wall an altar inscription made by members of the First Cohort of Varduli, cavalrymen, is one of the few dedications to the Matres, or mother goddesses, found in Roman Britain. The First Cohort of Varduli are also mentioned in inscriptions at the Antonine Wall, Longovicium in Durham, Bremenium and Corstopitum in Northumberland and on the Dere Street in Cappuck in the Scottish Borders. As with the Caristii, it is discussed whether the Varduli were an Aquitanian tribe or a Celt one, related to the Cantabri and Celtiberians. Their place-names (Toponyms) were clearly of Indo-European origin (probably Proto-Celtic language), as Uxama (comes from Upsama, meaning \\"the highest\\"), Deobriga (comes from Deiuo-Briga, meaning \\"holy hill\\"), Tullonium (comes from Tullo, meaning \\"valley\\"), among others. River-names (Hydronyms) such as Deva, Deua or Deba (Goddess) were also of Indo-European etymology. As with the Caristii, not a single toponym related to the Aquitanian-Basque languages has been found, further proving the theory of their Celtic origin and possible late Basquisation. However, but for a few exceptions (Deba, Zegama, Arakama) present-day place-names show a clear prevalence of the Basque linguistic element (sometimes mixed with Latin and Romance lexical roots). The last reference to the Varduli appears on a chronicle from Hydatius, where he narrates the devastations that suffered the Heruli when they attacked in the year 400 the Cantabrian coast and again in 456 after attacking Bardulia. Later in the next century, Saxons established on the Bordeaux estuary also were known to raid along the coast. It is believed by some that the Varduli suffered a Basquisation as a result of the continuous progress of the Vascones on their territory. They are not mentioned again in the Early Middle Ages and their place appeared the precursors of the province of Gipuzkoa. Some authorshttp://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/congresos/07217221.pdf deducted, following Classic documents, the existence of some ethnic affinity, collaboration, or political union between the Caristii, the Autrigones and the Varduli, tribes who later would all be grouped under the name Varduli, this would explain all the later events on this region, for example, why once the Caristii and Varduli were moved out of their original territories by the Vascones in the Early Middle Ages, the Caristii and Autrigones lost their names and were grouped together with the Varduli over the territory of the Autrigones who took refuge in their coastal areas behind the mountains from the Islamic military depredations from the Al-andalus new powers down the Ebro, which passed to be made after a century of resettlement into the Meseta plains as a frontier march or county of the Kingdom of Asturias in the middle years of the 8th century, the original one called Castile. The union, whichever the causes, between Varduli, Caristii and Autrigones on a unique territory would later create the blur County of Bardulia, mentioned as part of the Crown of Castile. The coat of arms of the Basque province of Gipuzkoa reads \\"Fidelissima Bardulia, Nunquam Superata\\",Juntas Generales de Gipuzkoa - Escudo y bandera meaning \\"Loyal Bardulia, never conquered\\".

It is also one of the six bicker clubs, along with The Ivy Club, Tiger Inn, Cap and Gown Club, Cannon Club and Tower Club. History In 1884, a group of freshmen who called themselves \\"The Seven Wise Men of Grease\\" of the Class of 1888, chose to eat in a private room on the second floor of Dohm's Restaurant on Nassau Street across from the campus. In their sophomore year, the group moved up Nassau Street to a hotel on the corner of Railroad Avenue (now University Place) known as The University Hotel. In September of their junior year as they were joined by several other students, they found a small house immediately south of The University Hotel on Railroad Avenue (where Hamilton Hall now stands) owned by the college, known as \\"The University Cottage\\". A couple was hired to cook and serve their meals. Prior to their graduation in 1888, the group invited members from the sophomore class to join their new venue. In 1889, new members of this society adopted legal papers and agreed on the name \\"The University Cottage Club of Princeton.\\" Selden, William K. Club Life at Princeton, A Historical Account of the Eating Clubs at Princeton University. Princeton Prospect Foundation, 1994, p10. In 1890, a lot on Prospect Avenue (upon which today's clubhouse stands) was purchased and a shingled Victorian clubhouse was built in 1892. The enrollment continued to grow and this structure was moved to Library Place when plans were made for a larger building. The current -story Georgian Revival clubhouse was designed by Charles Follen McKim of the New York architectural firm McKim, Mead and White in 1903 and built in 1906. The library on the second floor is modeled on the fourteenth century library in Merton College, Oxford University. In the Dining Room, one such carving reads ‚ÄúUbi Amici Ibidem Sunt Opes‚Äù (‚ÄúWhere there are friends there are riches‚Äù) which has become over the years a motto of the Club. In 1979, Cottage Club was one of three all-male eating clubs sued by 1980 Princeton graduate Sally Frank for sex discrimination. Ms. Frank prevailed in 1985. Following the suit, the Club voted to admit women in early 1986. Cottage has historically been numbered among the \\"Big Four\\" eating clubs of Princeton University (the others are Ivy, Cap and Gown, and Tiger Inn). Recent renovations have kept the club in first-class condition while preserving its historic beauty. Many young literary enthusiasts like to visit the library where F. Scott Fitzgerald began his novel This Side of Paradise. On September 14, 1999, the Club was entered onto the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. On November 15, 1999, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places based on the architectural structure of the building, high degree of historic integrity, and significant cultural contributions to the community.

Miss Freedom, originally named Goddess of Liberty, is the statue adorning the dome of the Georgia State Capitol since 1889. Commissioned in 1888, the hollow copper statue is painted white, weighs over 1600 lbs and is over 26 feet tall. She was sculpted with a torch in her right hand and a sword in her left. The torch is a functioning mercury-vapor lamp, casting a blue-green light at night. The torch in her right hand was supposed to be a working light continuously, but it remained dark until it was reconstructed in 1959. Tube and trolley systems have been installed so the bulb can be changed from the inside.  History  There were two different capitol locations before the current location. The current capitol building resides in the city of Atlanta. Construction of the Atlanta capitol started on November 13, 1884. The building took four and a half years and 250 men to complete. The statue of Miss Freedom was installed in 1888. Completion, and opening of the building, took place on March 20, 1889. The statue's origin is vague as the original documents pertaining to the construction of the State Capitol and Miss Freedom were burned. What records remain show that it originally came from the company Edbrooke & Burnham in Salem, Ohio. The statue's name prior to its christening is unknown, but it has possessed the names Miss Freedom, Liberty, and Goddess of Liberty.  Description  The statue wears a Phrygian cap, or pileus, adorned with a star. It wears a robe and holds a torch in her right hand and a sword in her left. The torch is meant to represent truth or enlightnment while the sword symbolizes authoritative armed liberty or enforced justice.

Since the 1980s, it has formed part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, albeit in modified form. History The loop emerged from two competing railways which were built from Newcastle to Tynemouth, and was not completed until 1909: the southern leg of what became the loop was built by the Newcastle and North Shields Railway in 1839 from via Wallsend; although initially terminating at North Shields, it was extended to Tynemouth in 1847. The northern leg was built by the Blyth and Tyne Railway in 1861 from to Tynemouth via Benton, although the original Blyth & Tyne route ran on a more inland course to Tynemouth from Monkseaton. Initially both railways had separate terminus stations at Tynemouth, but both lines had been taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER) by the 1870s. In 1882, the NER built a new coastal route from Monkseaton to Tynemouth via Whitley Bay, abandoning the original Blyth and Tyne inland route, and this allowed both legs of the route to join head on at Tynemouth, where a new through station was opened. However the loop was still not completed, as the northern and southern legs of the route still ran into separate unconnected termini at Newcastle. =Electrification= The line was electrified (as the Tyneside Electrics) by the NER in 1904 to fight competition from the newly built electric tramways. In 1909 the loop was finally completed when the original Blyth & Tyne terminus at New Bridge Street was closed and a line built to connect the northern leg of the route to an extended station.. However the route was de-electrified in 1967, and converted to diesel multiple unit operation. =Tyne and Wear Metro= As part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, the southern leg of the loop was diverted underground to a new terminus at St James, intersecting with the northern leg at Monument Metro station. In the late 1970s the loop was converted to form part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, which opened in stages beginning in 1980. Both the northern and southern legs of the loop were diverted onto new underground routes on the approach to Newcastle, so that both legs of the loop now intersect at the underground Monument Metro station. In order for the Metro to have its own independent route into Newcastle, the southern leg of the line via Wallsend was diverted just east of Heaton Junction onto a new route which runs parallel to the East Coast Main Line, serving two new stations at and , then traversing the Byker Viaduct, before running underground via and Monument to a new terminus at , and no longer serves Central Station; the northern leg does so indirectly via the underground Central Metro station.

Origins Their historical territory today corresponds very well with the extension of the Biscayan dialect of the Basque language, however it is discussed if the Caristii were actually Aquitanians, related to the Vascones, or if they were Celts, related to tribes such as the Cantabri and Celtiberians and that later suffered a Basquisation.Ethnic map of the Iberian Peninsula after the Second Punic War  History  The Caristii are first mentioned by Roman sources; Pliny the Elder names them Carietes and places them in the Basque interior territories, what today is the southernmost regions of the Basque Country, while Ptolemy places them between the river Deba and Nervi√≥n, present-day provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, with a territory triangle-shaped, reaching the city of Vitoria by the south. Their territory limited with the Varduli at east, Cantabri at west and Autrigones at southwest. Their main cities were Tullica, probably Tuyo, Erriberagoitia in the banks of the river Zadorra; Suessatio, which could be present-day Arkaia; and Veleia or Velegia, the last two were located near the Roman road from Bordeaux to Astorga.Emborujo, A., Ortiz de Urbina, E., and Santos, J.

Complutum, (2):449. http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/en/photo/mu-4158/; another city in their land was Vesperies, on the Atlantic coast (south coast of the Bay of Biscay). The toponyms of their cities are from Indo-European origin (Celtic or Proto-Celtic languages), Tullica (from \\"Tullo\\", valley), Suessatio (well settled). As it happens with their neighbors, the Varduli, not a single toponym related to the Aquitanian-Basque languages has been found, further proving the theories about their possible Celt origin and possible late Basquisation. They are not mentioned again in the Early Middle Ages, on their place appeared the precursors of the provinces of Biscay and Alava. Some authorshttp://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/congresos/07217221.pdf deducted, following Classic documents, the existence of some ethnic affinity, collaboration, or political union between Caristii, Autrigones and Varduli, tribes who later would all be grouped under the name Varduli, this would explain all the later events on this region, for example, why once the Caristii and Varduli were moved out of their original territories by the Vascones in the Early Middle Ages, the Caristii and Autrigones lost their names and were grouped together with the Varduli. The union, whichever the causes, between Varduli, Caristii and Autrigones on a unique territory would later create the County of Bardulia, part of the Crown of Castile.

Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs. At the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon, mixing clinical work and research. Woodruff principally studied transplant rejection and immunosuppression. His work in these areas of transplantation biology led Woodruff to perform the first kidney transplant in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1969. Although retiring from surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organizations.  Early life  Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England, the son of Harold Addison Woodruff and his wife, Margaret Ada Cooper. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a professor of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.Morris, p. 457. The remainder of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in Finchley. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a staphylococcal septicaemia. The two then spent a short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.Woodruff, Michael. Nothing Venture Nothing Win. Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1996. . In 1919, Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first marriage. The two boys did their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's Pasteur Institute. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at Queen's College in Taunton, Somerset on the south coast of England. The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as \\"colonials\\" who were \\"backward\\" and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate. Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist Wesley College, where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing.Morris, p. 458. He won a government scholarship to the University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. He decided to take up medical studies at the end of his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours. After graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal medicine for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Woodruff then started his surgical training.  World War II  At the outbreak of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941. At that time, he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel. A chapel built by Australian POWs at the Changi Prison Camp where Woodruff was held during World War II. After being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. In the camp, Woodruff realized that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, soya beans, rice polishings, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled \\"Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps\\". Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.Morris, p. 459. While stationed at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical an√¶sthetics severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used hypnotism as the sole means of an√¶sthesia for a wide range of dental and surgical procedures.Sampimon, R.L.H. & Woodruff, M.F.A., \\"Some Observations Concerning the use of Hypnosis as a Substitute for An√¶sthesia\\", The Medical Journal of Australia, (23 March 1946), pp.393-395. At the conclusion of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives.Morris, p. 460.  Early career  Soon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no guarantee of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work.Morris, p. 461. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed‚Äîa result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi. = Sheffield = After passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, he had planned to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. = Aberdeen = In 1948, shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne, Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the University of Aberdeen where he was given a post as a senior lecturer, having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand. At Aberdeen, Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson, and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services.Morris, pp. 461‚Äì462. He took advantage of this access and his wife's skills as a lab assistant to investigate in utero grafts (tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the womb). At the time, the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given in utero grafts, he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection. Woodruff's experiments with rats, however, produced negative results. Woodruff also commenced work on antilymphocyte serum for immunosuppression, with little initial success.Morris, p. 462. While in Aberdeen, Woodruff also visited the United States on a World Health Organization (WHO) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met many of the leading American surgeons, an experience that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff experimented with the effects of cortisone and the impact of blood antigen on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts. When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors. In 1951 Woodruff was awarded a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application. = Dunedin = The University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, where Woodruff worked from 1953 to 1957. In 1953, Woodruff moved to Dunedin New Zealand to become Professor of Surgery at the University of Otago. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London and St Andrews University in Scotland. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance to allografts in rats. This line of research proved unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in Dunedin, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in his four years in New Zealand, Dunedin's population of 100,000 was insufficient to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.Morris, p. 463.  Edinburgh  Diagram illustrating a typical kidney transplant such as those Woodruff performed in Edinburgh. In 1957, Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council. The research group's principal investigations concerned immunological tolerance (the body's acceptance of tissues, as opposed to rejection), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked with the use of immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation. Most notably, he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year- old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. The donor kidney was harvested by James Ross and transplanted by Woodruff. Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'. The success of Woodruff's clinical transplant program was recognised and enhanced by funding from the Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.Morris, p. 464. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations. Woodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent the next ten years there, engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on tumor immunology using Corynebacterium parvum. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.  Legacy  Woodruff's contributions to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised a method of implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's contributions to the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day. These important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. The next year, 1969, Woodruff was knighted by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff honorary membership, including the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as Vice-President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a visiting professor at a number of universities.Morris, p. 467. Despite his profound influence on transplantation and what Peter Morris called \\"a commanding presence in any gathering\\", Woodruff was not known for his ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and had a tendency to mumble. Nevertheless, Morris said that Woodruff has \\"a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour\\". Morris concluded that \\"What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous.\\" = Publications = Woodruff's impact is also apparent in his large volume of publications. In addition to authoring over two hundred scholarly papers, Woodruff wrote eight books during his career, covering numerous aspects of medicine and surgery. * Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps.

Their first son completed a civil engineering degree at Sheffield University, where the daughter also attended, completing a science degree in botany. The second son did a medical degree at University College London and became an ophthalmologist. Woodruff and his wife were avid tennis players and had a court in their home in Edinburgh.Morris, p. 469. After moving to Edinburgh, Woodruff took up sailing with the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and went on to compete in some races. He owned a boat and was known to go sailing on it in the Mediterranean each summer with his wife. During his student years, Woodruff was a keen rower and field hockey player. Woodruff was a lover of classical music, and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E Floyd, the organist of St Paul's Cathedral, he became the college organist at Queen‚Äôs College in Melbourne; he later learned to play the piano. In his spare time, Woodruff continued to pursue his love of pure mathematics, especially number theory. He periodically attempted to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, but failed.Morris, p. 468.

Strabo mentions them in his book Geographica, naming them all√≥trigones, a word adapted from Greek meaning \\"strange people\\". Based on the study of their toponyms - as also happens with the Caristii and Varduli - it is likely they were a Celtic tribe who eventually suffered a process of Basquisation. The known toponyms of the Autrigones are of Celtic origin, as Uxama Barca in present-day √Ålava, and many others ending in -briga.¬´Indoeuropeizaci√≥n¬ª. Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa OnLine. The toponyms of rivers, as the Nervi√≥n, the anthroponyms, the archeological remains, tools and weapons relate them culturally with the Celts, but with a clear differentiation of other close Celtic tribes, as the Celtiberians.¬´Etnog√©nesis del Pa√≠s Vasco¬ª. Euskomedia.  Culture  The Autrigones were culturally related to the early Iron Age \\"Monte Bernorio-Miraveche\\" cultural group of northern Burgos and Palencia provinces. Additional archeological evidence indicates that by the 2nd Iron Age they came under the influence of the Celtiberians. By the 1st century BC they were organized into a federation of autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (Civitates) on the mountain ranges of the upper Ebro, protected by stout adobe walls of the \\"Numantine\\" type. More archeological evidence have been found, emphasizing their celtiberian culture, such as the hospitality tesserae. These consisted on a zoomorphic-shaped metal tablet with an inscription using a variant of the Northeastern Iberian script (also known as Celtiberian script), written in a form of celtiberian language.¬´Nueva t√©sera celtib√©rica en la provincia de Burgos¬ª. Universidad de La Rioja. History Around the beginning of the 4th century BC the Autrigones migrated to the Peninsula and overrun the entire area corresponding today to the modern provinces of Cantabria and Burgos, which eventually became known as Autrigonia or Austrigonia. By the mid-4th century BC the Autrigones reached the Pisuerga valley where they established their capital Autraca or Austraca, located at the banks of the river Autra (Odra). They also gained an outlet to the sea by seizing from the Aquitanian-speaking Caristii further east the coastal highland region between the rivers As√≥n and Neroua (Nervi√≥n), in the modern eastern Cantabria, Vizcaya, and √Ålava Basque provinces. However, the Autrigones‚Äô hold to this vast territory was not meant to last; some time after 300 BC they were driven out from southern Autrigonia ‚Äì the western Burgos region ‚Äì by the Turmodigi allied with the Vaccei, who seized the Autrigones‚Äô early capital Autraca. Thrust back to their lands on the mountain ranges of the upper Ebro north of the Arlanz√≥n valley around the 3rd-2nd Centuries BC, the Autrigones allied themselves with the Berones and evolved into a tribal society similar to the peoples of the north-west. By the 1st century BC, they were organized into a federation of ten autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (Civitates), chiefly among them their new capital Virovesca in the Oca river valley. = Romanization = They seem to have taken no part in the Celtiberian Wars though as traditional allies of the Berones helped the latter in fighting off the Roman general Sertorius' incursion into northern Celtiberia in 76 BC,Livy, Frag. lib., 91. and remained independent until the late 1st century BC, when the mounting pressure of Astures and Cantabri raids finally forced them to seek an alliance with Rome. Despite being aggregated in the new Hispania Tarraconensis province at the early 1st century AD, the Autrigones were only partially romanized, never became Christian and continued to provide the Roman Imperial army with auxiliary troops (Auxilia) up to the late Empire. The Autrigone people survived the overthrow of the Roman Empire in Spain by the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century and briefly recreated their realm in parts of the current provinces of Burgos, √Ålava, and Biscay which lasted for nearly two centuries, before being conquered by their Varduli neighbours and ultimately destroyed or absorbed by the Vascones in around AD 580.¬´Localizaci√≥n de algunas ciudades v√°rdulas citadas por Mela y Ptolomeo¬ª.

Tax on contributions =Types of contributions= Superannuation contributions are either concessional or non-concessional contributions.Contribution caps Concessional contributions (sometimes referred to as \\"before-tax\\" contributions) are contributions for which someone (such as an employer) has or will receive a tax deduction. Concessional contributions include superannuation guarantee (SG) contributions, salary sacrifice contributions,https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in- detail/growing/guide-for-employees-and-self-employed---reportable- superannuation-contributions/?page=4#Reportable_employer_super_contributions other employer contributions and contributions claimed as a personal tax deduction. Concessional contributions are taxed in the fund. While taxable components do not change the tax payable by the superannuation fund, they may be a factor in calculating the tax payable on withdrawals from a super fund. Non-concessional contributions (also referred to as \\"undeducted\\" or \\"after- tax\\" contributions) are contributions for which no-one has or will receive a tax deduction. Non-concessional contributions are, generally, not taxed in the fund. =Contribution caps= Contributions to superannuation funds are subject to two types of \\"caps\\", and a third has been proposed in the 2016 federal budget. The annual concessional contributions cap since 2014/15 has been $30,000, with the cap for people over the age of 49 at the start of each year being $35,000.Contributions caps Concessional contributions are assessable income of the fund taxed at 15%. Concessional contributions in excess of the annual \\"concessional contributions cap\\" is included in the member's taxable income, taxed at their marginal tax rate, plus an excess concessional contributions charge, on top of the 15% already applying to concessional contributions.http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in- detail/contributions/super-contributions---too-much-super-can-mean-extra- tax/?page=12 In the 2016 federal budget, the government proposed to reduce, effective 1 July 2016, the annual before-tax contributions limit to $25,000. Since 2014/15, the annual non-concessional contributions cap was $180,000 (or $540,000 in a three-year period under the bring-forward ruleSuperannuation rates and thresholds for 2015/2016 year (and earlier years)), up from $150,000 and $450,000 previously. Non-concessional contributions under the \\"non- concessional contributions cap\\" are not taxed in the fund. However, if the annual non-concessional contributions cap is exceeded a tax rate of 46.5% applies to the excess. In the 2016 federal budget, the government proposed to change, effective 1 July 2016, the non-concessional contributions cap to a lifetime cap of $500,000 instead of the annual cap of $180,000 and the abolition of the bring-forward rule. In the 2016 federal budget, the government proposed to create, effective 1 July 2017, a new cap of $1.6 million on amounts that can be moved into the tax-free pension phase, where previously there was no such limit. Members who have a balance in a retirement phase account in excess of this limit will have until 30 June 2017 to either return the excess funds into accumulation phase or take the money out of superannuation. Retirement phase accounts in excess of this limit will be taxed at 15% on earnings, the same as for an accumulation phase account. Investment income of superannuation funds =Exempt income= The investment income of superannuation funds derived from those assets backing pensions (i.e., retirement phase accounts) is \\"exempt\\" income of the fund. In the 2016 federal budget, the government proposed to abolish, effective 1 July 2017, the exemption for investment income on a retirement phase account if the balance in the account exceeds $1.6 million. Where all the members of a fund are retired with balances below this threshold then the whole of the fund's income is tax exempt. Where a fund has its members split between non-retired and retired phases then it is necessary to have an actuary to certify the proportion of the fund's income that is exempt (unless the pension assets are fully segregated). This is done by way of obtaining an annual actuarial certificate. =Assessable income= All other investment income of superannuation funds is generally assessable income of the fund and subject to a 15% tax. =Allowable deductions= Expenses of the superannuation fund, such as administration expenses, investment management expenses and insurance premiums, are allowable deductions against the fund income. Life insurance premiums paid by the fund are also deductible by the fund from assessable income; while the same premium if paid directly by the individual member may not be tax deductible. Capital gains Where an investment or other asset is sold or otherwise disposed, the profit on sale is subject to a capital gains tax. Superannuation funds can claim a capital gains tax discount where the asset has been owned for at least 12 months. The discount applicable to superannuation funds is 33%, reducing the effective tax rate on capital gains from 15% to 10%. No discount or adjustment is available if an asset is sold at a loss. Capital losses can only be applied against capital gains and cannot be claimed against other income, but may be carried forward to the next year and applied against the later year's capital gains. Taxation =Taxable income= The taxable income of a superannuation fund is the fund's assessable income less allowable deductions. Assessable income includes concessional (i.e., taxable) contributions received, net investment income and discounted capital gains. It does not include exempt income and undeducted contributions. Undeducted contributions are those which the employer or the member cannot or has chosen not to claim as a deduction from their respective assessable income. =Tax rates= The taxable income of a superannuation fund is taxed at a flat rate of 15%; however, concessional contributions of those members whose taxable income exceeds $300,000 are subject to a rate of 30%. In the 2016 federal budget, the government proposed to reduce, effective 1 July 2017, the threshold when the tax rate of 30% comes in to members whose taxable income exceeds $250,000. In reality, the actual average tax rate can be lower than this, typically around 6.5%,George Rothman, 2000, \\"Assessing The Tax Advantages Of Investment In Superannuation \\". because: * the dividend imputation system allows a credit for imputation credits on Australian shares, which may result in a tax refund. * capital gains on assets held more than 12 months may be entitled to a capital gain tax discount. * other tax credits such as foreign tax credits may apply. Additional taxes are payable if contributions received exceed the applicable contribution caps. =Tax credits= If the taxable income includes dividend income, any imputation credits attached to those dividends form part of the fund income, either assessable or exempt. In either case, the fund is entitled to a tax credit for the imputation credits as if they are a credit for tax paid by the fund. If the credits exceed the fund's tax liability, the excess is refundable. =Government \\"co-contribution\\" = Personal (nonconcessional, after-tax) contributions by members whose taxable income is less than $35,454 will attract a government \\"co-contribution\\" of 50c for each $1 contributed, up to a total of $500. The co-contribution shades out and stops entirely when the member's taxable income exceeds $50,454. Tax on benefits paid Taxation of benefits is very complex and depends on whether: * the benefit is received as a lump sum or a pension * the benefit is received for retirement, death or disability * the benefit is paid to a dependent or non-dependent * the tax payer was a member of a fund prior to 1983 Other factors that could affect the tax liability of benefits include the level of undeducted contributions made and other components such as transfers of amounts from the sale of a small business. Generally for a lump sum superannuation payout (called an \\"eligible termination benefit\\"): * the portion of the benefit relating to undeducted contributions is tax free. * the remaining amount below the low tax threshold ($160,000 in 2010/11 for those 55 and older) is tax free, with the low tax threshold being indexed annually by Average Weekly Overtime Earnings in increments of $5,000. * amounts above that are generally taxed at 15% plus the Medicare levy. For recipients of social security payments, pension amounts are taxed as normal income through the PAYG system except where there is a deduction for the portion of the benefits funded by undeducted contributions (the \\"deductible amount\\") or at a 15% rebate on the pension amount less the deductible amount. Special arrangements applied for benefits which exceeded the reasonable benefit limits. These rules ceased on 1 July 2007. Since 1 July 2007, no taxes are payable on benefits paid to members over age 60, one of the measures arising from the 2006 federal budget.

The farmstead was known as √ûj√≥√∞hildarsta√∞ir (Thj√≥dhildsstead) by the time of Ivar Bardarson's report of ca 1360/64. In the 14th century, it belonged to the Kings of Norway: > N√¶st Einarsfir√∞i liggr Hvalseyjarfj√∂r√∞r. √ûar er kirkja, sem heitir > Hvalseyjarfjar√∞arkirkja.

On this firth stands a large farmstead, which > belongs to the king and is called Thjodhild's Stead. The farmstead was a major center in South Greenland. The site, which has the ruins of two stone great halls, had an additional 14 houses close to a churchhouse. The old hall, which is long and or wide, is in the middle of the ruins. The well-preserved newer hall measures by . Church The ruins of the church at Hvalsey The church house, which was first erected in the early 12th century, might have been built by Scots-Norse stonemasons as similar structures are found in Norway and Orkney. The church might have been maintained due to the site's royal ownership.Ivar Bardarson (√çvar B√°r√∞arson), Gr√¶nlandsl√Ωsing, written sometime after 1360. The church house was exceptionally well built from carefully chosen stones that in some cases weigh in excess of five tons. Its walls, which are up to thick, measure by on the outside. The gables rise to from the floor and may have risen 2m higher when first constructed. Side walls, which would have been higher when new, now stand . The building was plastered with ground mussel shells and would have been white when in use and was roofed with timber and turf. A 1408 wedding at the site's church is the last documented event to occur during the Norse settlement of Greenland. Two years later the Icelandic newlyweds, ship's captain √ûorsteinn √ìlafsson and Sigr√≠√∞ur Bj√∂rnsd√≥ttir, returned to Norway, before sailing to Iceland and settling on the bride's family farm at Akrar, north Iceland, in 1413. The details were recorded in letters between papal dignitaries in Iceland and the Vatican. Archaeological evidence shows that over the next hundred years the last Norse settlements in Greenland slowly died out. It was not until 1721 that a joint merchant-clerical expedition led by Danish missionary Hans Egede discovered that the Norse colonies in Southern Greenland had disappeared.

Spector accepted on the condition that the song be rewritten with different lyrics as \\"Things Are Changing (For the Better)\\". This version would later be recorded by The Supremes, Jay and the Americans, and The Blossoms. Background \\"Don't Hurt My Little Sister\\" was written about Brian Wilson's relation with the three Rovell sisters, Diane, Marilyn, and Barbara. He had become close with them, and eventually married Marilyn, but also held feelings for her sisters. Brian Wilson later stated that he thought that the Rovell sisters' parents \\"assumed I liked Diane best, since she and I still spent the most time together talking. Deep down I still harbored feelings for cute little Barbara, though I continually reminded myself she was too young.\\" Brian Wilson's songwriting co-writer Gary Usher said, \\"When Brian moved out of his apartment and began living at the Rovells' house, he fell madly in love with Barbara, Marilyn and Diane's younger sister.

It was incorporated in 1853 to unify several private railways and waggonways that were concerned with bringing coal from the Northumberland coalfield to Blyth and to the River Tyne. Over the years it expanded its network to include Ashington, Morpeth and Tynemouth. As coal output increased the company became very prosperous in hauling the mineral to quays for export, and in addition a residential passenger service based on Newcastle built up. It was absorbed by the much larger North Eastern Railway in 1874, and some integration of service and facilities took place, but the Blyth and Tyne section retained its individual identity. In 1904 electric traction was introduced for suburban passenger trains on north Tyneside and part of the Blyth and Tyne system was electrified; the new trains proved a considerable success. Speculative branch lines built in the twentieth century were less successful. In the period from 1975 coal extraction declined, and parts of the Blyth and Tyne system that were dependent on the mineral traffic suffered accordingly, and the passenger business too declined. At the end of the 1970s the decision was taken to establish a light rapid transit system, the Tyne and Wear Metro, based on the North Tyneside network at first, and this started operating in 1980, using part of the Blyth and Tyne routes. Most of the remainder of the former system has no railway activity now. History =Before the Blyth and Tyne Railway= From the seventeenth century, coal had been extracted in the area north of the River Tyne, at first close to the river to allow onwards transport by boat. As the easiest deposits close to the river became worked out, the focus of mining was pushed back further, and transport to the waterway was essential. Wooden waggonways were introduced and were relatively successful, but a major limitation was the issue of wayleaves, by which owners of land on the proposed route could demand payment, usually on a tonnage basis, for allowing the passage of the wagons. The wayleave demands were heavy, and this continued to be a major difficulty. Wallace recorded that \\"in 1723, Plessy colliery was in the hands of Richard Ridley; and as he was a man of both wealth and enterprise he would in all probability make the railway by which the coals then came to Blyth\\". The harbour at Blyth was used for the onward transport by coastal shipping. Mining of the early Northumberland Coalfield was taking shape. In 1794 a colliery was commenced within a mile of Cowpen, which at once brought a large increase of population and trade. \\"An Act of Parliament was obtained, and Cowpen Quay was erected... [About 1812] when Plessy Colliery was discontinued, a railroad was made to connect Cowpen Colliery with Blyth, as we have it at the present time, and instead of the coal being shipped at Cowpen Quay it was sent to Blyth.\\" The Plessy waggonway played a peripheral role in the Napoleonic Wars: > One Sunday morning in the year 1811, the inhabitants [of Blyth] were thrown > into a state of great excitement, by the startling news that five Frenchmen > had been taken during the night, and were lodged in the guard-house. They > were officers who had broken their parole at Edinburgh castle, and in making > their way home had reached the neighbourhood of Blyth; when discovered they > were resting by the side of Plessy wagon-way, beside the \\"shoulder of > mutton\\" field. The railway had timber track: > The railway was constructed of a double line of beech rails, and laid upon > oaken sleepers. The railway from Plessy continued to be made of wood till > the road was discontinued in 1812. Originally the wagons had wooden wheels, > and to prevent the wear and tear of the wheels, which were extremely > expensive to maintain, they were studded with nails driven up to the head... > Each wagon required a horse, and a man to conduct it; three journeys or > \\"gaits\\", as they were termed, was a day‚Äôs work. There was considerable expenditure on new pits at Seghill and Cramlington in 1822 and 1823. The Tyne was six miles away and the problem of transport to water arose once again. The Cramlington waggonway was only two miles away, however. It was opened in 1822 and ran from the pit later known as Ann Pit to Murton Row where it joined the Backworth line. Backworth Colliery had had a primitive railway, but the section between Backworth and Allotment was converted to rope haulage by stationary steam engine in 1821. Two years later the incline between Allotment and Percy Main was altered and eased, and the whole line was rope worked by 1827. About 1838 the line was extended north- westwards to West Cramlington, and when the Newcastle and Berwick Railway was constructed, a junction was made with it there. In 1839 the Seaton Delaval coal company sunk a new pit, and formed a waggonway 1¬º miles in length from there to Mare Close where it was connected to the Cramlington line. In the same year the Cramlington company, considering that their dependency on the congested Backworth line was becoming impossible, constructed their own line to the staiths, parallel to, and to the east of, the Backworth line, leaving it at Murton Row.Lee, Charles E, May & June 1943, \\"The Blyth and Tyne Railway\\", The Railway Magazine =The Seghill Railway= System map of the Blyth and Tyne Railway in 1854The Seghill colliery owner was also dissatisfied with the route to the staiths, and in early 1839 Robert Nicholson made a survey for a private mineral railway from Seghill to Howdon. Nicholson had been engineer of the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, which was shortly to open. The owners of the colliery at Seghill had used the Cramlington waggonway, owned by the Cramlington Coal Company, but the latter favoured its own traffic and put obstructions in the way of the Seghill coal. The main part of the route ran straight south east, crossing the old line of the Cramlington Coal Company by a low timber bridge of two laminated arches each of span. There were steep gradients on the line; from Seghill to Prospect Hill rising as steep as 1 in 61, and from Prospect Hill to the Tyne falling gradients, the steepest of which was 1 in 25. The line was worked mainly by stationary engines, one at Prospect Hill, near the Allotment, which hauled up the loaded wagons from Holywell, and the empty wagons from the Newcastle and North Shields road. The other engine was at Percy Main, hauling the empty wagons from the staiths. From Prospect Hill to Percy Main and from Percy Main to the staiths the loaded wagons ran by gravity, unwinding as they descended a tail rope from the drum of the engine, to bring hack the empty wagons. The remainder of the line from Seghill to Holywell was worked by locomotives; those used at first were the Samson and the John, both built by Timothy Hackworth. The Newcastle and North Shields Railway contemplated building an extension of the Seghill line to Blyth, but the takeover of the N&NSR; by the Newcastle and Berwick Railway diverted attention to wider horizons. =Harbours= The onward transport of coal by water was restricted by the fact that the only harbours available were at Blyth and Seaton Sluice, both of them small and incapable of handling larger vessels. From 1842, the Bedlington Coal Company developed a novel method of shipping its coal: loaded chaldron wagons, 40 at a time, were taken in an iron twin-screw steamer, the Bedlington, from the staiths on the north side of the River Blyth near Mount Pleasant to Shields Harbour; there they were discharged into the coastal shops by means of steam derricks fitted to Bedlington. This arrangement continued in use until 1851. Other proposals involved further railways and waggonways but for the time being they were not implemented. Nevertheless, the limitation of Blyth as a harbour spurred consideration of a railway connection directly to the Tyne, and it was this cause that led ultimately to the formation of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. =The Blyth and Tyne Junction Railway= From 25 June 1844, the Newcastle and North Shields Railway (N&NSR;) worked the passenger and goods traffic on the Seghill Railway, but in November 1844 George Hudson, \\"The Railway King,\\" made a provisional agreement with the N&NSR; to merge that undertaking with the Newcastle & Berwick Railway which he was promoting at the time; the N&NSR; gave his Berwick company access to central Newcastle. When the N&NSR; was authorised on 31 July 1845, the arrangement was confirmed. In the changed circumstances the Seghill Railway and the projected extensions assumed a new importance. In July 1845, Jobling & Partners decided to construct a part of the proposed railway, and, by forming a junction with the Seaton Delaval Railway and arranging for the connection of that railway with the Seghill Railway, to create a route to the Tyne. The line was named the Blyth and Tyne Junction Railway. Construction was started in August 1845, but the line was not opened for passenger traffic until 3 March 1847; on that date the whole 4¬Ω miles between Seghill and Blyth began to cater for passengers. =Bedlington extension= Bedlington colliery needed to be connected to the network, and on 12 June 1850 a private line was opened from the colliery to Newsham, a distance of 2¬æ miles. Mineral traffic only was carried at first, but it was opened for passengers also on 1 August 1850. In effect this was an extension of the growing Blyth and Tyne Railway; it crossed the River Blyth by a timber viaduct 80 feet in height and 770 feet in length. Described as a \\"splendid viaduct\\" by newspapers, it was designed by Robert Nicholson. =Incorporation of the Blyth and Tyne Railway= There were now several separate private railways, and there was a movement to make them into a single, incorporated company. The spur was passenger duty imposed on private railways, and also concern about promotion of a possible competing railway. They connected two parts of the group together by cutting through Prospect Hill in the year 1851 to enable the adoption of locomotive power; the new cut formed considerably gentler gradients. With other improvements the expenditure was about ¬£130,000. The Act incorporating the Blyth and Tyne Railway received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1852, capital ¬£150,000. The line controlled by the new company totalled 13 miles, consisting of the main line from Blyth to the Hayhole on the Tyne (12 miles), a short branch to the York. Newcastle & Berwick Railway at Percy Main, the connection with the former Newcastle & North Shields Railway, and several short branches to shipping places on the Tyne. The new Company came into existence on 1 January 1853. A rival company, the Tynemouth Docks & Morpeth & Shields Direct Railway, proposed a dock at the Low Lights, North Shields, and a railway from Morpeth running directly to North Shields, with branches to Ashington and Seaton Sluice. The Blyth and Tyne Railway deposited Parliamentary plans for lines occupying part of the same ground to spoil the competing line, and both proposals went to Parliament. The promoters of the Tynemouth Docks Direct Railway hoped to take advantage of avoiding the cost of wayleaves with which the Blyth and Tyne was burdened, and the B&TR; found itself uniting with the landowners who imposed these charges against the newcomer. Its reward was a concession by the landowners, reducing their terms by a third. The Tynemouth Dock Bill was thrown out in Parliament, and the Blyth and Tyne Railway succeeded in getting the powers it had applied for, by Act of 4 August 1853. There was to be a branch from Newsham to Morpeth and another from New Hartley to the Dairy House near Seaton Delaval, a line ultimately planned to reach Tynemouth. The B&TR; intended to buy some existing private lines and continue one of them to Morpeth. The B&TR; was committed to the completion of a line to Tynemouth and in 1854 obtained Parliamentary authorisation to make this extension, as well as a building a branch from Bedlington to Longhirst. =Improvements= System map of the Blyth and Tyne Railway in 1874 From 1855 a number of extensions were built to consolidate the network. Prospect Hill was further improved and double track provided over six miles of railway, and more staiths were built in the Tyne. They purchased two short colliery lines which formed portions of their main line between Seaton Delaval and Hartley and between Bedlington and Newsham, and constructed the branch line to Morpeth. They also planned the eastward extension to Whitley and Tynemouth. Northumberland Dock was opened on 22 October 1857 and their presence there was a valuable asset in taking Northumberland steam coal to market. On 1 October 1857 the Morpeth branch was opened for mineral traffic, and on 1 April 1858 for goods and passenger traffic. In 1855 passengers on the Blyth and Tyne were conveyed in low-roofed springless carriages locally called \\"bumler boxes,\\" but the Company decided to improve the passenger carriages while they made the network extensions. The company obtained new passenger rolling stock of modern design. The third class carriages were of a type then probably unsurpassed elsewhere in the country. They were designed in 1854, and twenty years later had given such satisfaction that the travelling public desired no change.Newcastle Chronicle, 1 September 1874, quoted by Lee =North British Railway= Morpeth railwaysIn the period from 1857 the North British Railway was frustrated by its dependency on the North Eastern Railway (which had taken over the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway in 1854). It had proved a wily partner in the traffic between Edinburgh and Newcastle. The NBR was anxious to secure independent access to Newcastle if possible. The NBR supported the promotion of the Border Counties Railway, which was being built in stages from Hexham, on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway to Riccarton on the Border Union Railway (which became known as the Waverley Route). Although this was to be a slow and circuitous line, mostly single line through thinly populated terrain, it served the NBR purpose of providing, or at least threatening, a separate route to Newcastle from the north. However the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was not unfriendly to the YN&BR; and might prove an uncertain ally. The Wansbeck Railway was then promoted, with the intention of forming a connection between Reedsmouth on the Border Counties Railway and Morpeth. The commercial viability of this line was even more shaky‚ÄîLee says \\"a thinly-populated district without manufactures and with very few mineral resources\\"‚Äîthan the Border Counties Railway, but it gave access to Morpeth, avoiding the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway altogether. If the Blyth and Tyne Railway could be befriended, then the desired access to Newcastle was secure‚Äîbut by a very roundabout route. When the Wansbeck Railway was constructed, the North British (who were in control of it) considered how to connect to the Blyth and Tyne at Morpeth. That company's station was alongside, but on the south side of, the York, Newcastle and Berwick station, and direct connection was difficult. (Running over the YN&BR; line, even for a few yards, would defeat the notion of independence.) In fact the Wansbeck line crossed the YN&BR; line by a bridge and connected to the Blyth and Tyne line further east. For simple through running that was practicable, but in the event only local traffic ran, and all of that started or ended at Morpeth B&T; station. This involved reversal at the point of junction, and propelling between there and the station. This was a dangerous practice, and a collision took place in 1871 from that cause. By then hopes of independent main line running to Newcastle were over, and in 1872 the Wansbeck line was diverted to connect into the YN&BR; station in the ordinary way.G W M Sewell, The North British Railway in Northumberland, Merlin Books Ltd, Braunton, 1991, The Blyth and Tyne station at Morpeth remained in use for tis own passenger trains until 24 May 1880, after which B&T; trains used the NER station. =Extension to Newcastle, and others= The Chairman of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, Joseph Laycock, proposed to build an extension to Newcastle. The necessary Parliamentary Act was secured on 1 May 1861. It authorised the extension to Newcastle, as well as some branches, forming the loop from Newcastle through South Gosforth and Benton to Monkseaton; and from Seghill to the Seaton Burn waggonway, from Bothal Demesne (North Seaton) to Newbiggin, and from the B&TR; existing line at Tynemouth to proposed docks at the Low Lights. The Blyth & Tyne line between the Dairy House and Tynemouth was opened on 31 October 1860. The new extension from Hotspur Place (near Benton) to Newcastle, and from Hotspur Place to Monkseaton in the other direction, was formally opened on 22 June 1864; the public opening took place on the 27 June. The Newcastle terminus was at , on the north side of the city beyond the present-day Manors station; it was designed by John Dobson, who had also designed the Central station. At the same time a further connection was made at Tynemouth, where an extension ran from the earlier terminus of 1860 to a location close to the North Eastern Railway station there. The Blyth and Tyne Railway charged the same fares to Tynemouth as the North Eastern Railway, and the new line was extremely well patronised: 17,000 passengers, mostly third class, were carried during the first week. Third class business was proving popular and the B&TR; announced that from 1 October 1864 third class travel would be available on all trains. Third class carriages had formerly only been attached to one train each way daily; misgivings that this would abstract income by trading down were stated by the Chairman to have been misplaced.Report of Shareholders' Meeting in the Newcastle Journal, 21 February 1865 In 1867 a branch was opened extending the Bedlington stub eastwards to Cambois, on the coast north of the River Blyth. Some years elapsed before the opening of the final extension of the Blyth and Tyne Railway during its independent days: on 1 March 1872 the Newbiggin branch of 3¬Ω miles was opened. It joined the Cambois branch at West Sleekburn Junction. =Amalgamation= During 1872 the North Eastern Railway approached the Blyth and Tyne Railway to discuss a merger. The directors of the B&TR; were agreeable, but they held out for the best terms they could get, and towards the end of January 1874, terms of amalgamation were settled. The North Eastern Railway would guarantee a dividend of 10 per cent on Blyth and Tyne ordinary stock (then capitalised at ¬£315,000) and to pay ¬£50,000 in cash for distribution among the ordinary shareholders, as well as taking on all the liabilities of the B&TR.; The merger was ratified by Act of Parliament of 7 August 1874. The Blyth and Tyne section of the North Eastern Railway continued to have an individual identity. =Whitley Bay new line= When the Tynemouth branch had been built in 1860, it ran north to south from Monkseaton (at first called Whitley) at some distance from the coast. As residential travel increased in subsequent decades, the emphasis was on locations nearer the coast. The Blyth and Tyne Railway had obtained powers to build a parallel line to serve those areas in 1872, but the authorisation was never put into effect. After the amalgamation, the north Eastern Railway decided to reactivate the powers, and obtained a fresh Act of Parliament on 29 June 1875. There was still delay in carrying out the work, but on 3 July 1882 the new line opened. It ran to make an end-on connection (from the east) with the existing Tynemouth terminus, and a lavish new station was provided there. A new station was provided at Monkseaton on the new line, and a complex layout of short spurs connected it into the old system there. Whitley Bay and Cullercoats also had new stations. (Whitley Bay was further enlarged in 1910.) The old route from Monkseaton to Tynemouth was closed down, except for a short length at Tynemouth used to access the goods depot there. =North Blyth= In 1867 the Cambois branch had been opened. In 1893 further expansion was necessary on the River Blyth and extensive facilities were provided on the north bank; rail connection was provided by extending the Cambois line. This work was commissioned on 13 July 1896; at the same time a curve was installed near Sleekburn Junction giving direct running from North Blyth towards Ashington; this was brought into use at the same time. In 1903 the North Eastern Railway introduced 40-ton bogie coal wagons to operate a shuttle service between Ashington and North Blyth. =Locomotives= Most of the Blyth and Tyne locomotives were of the 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 type' the 2-4-0s mostly had 5 ft 6 in wheels and two 16 by 24-inch cylinders; working boiler pressure was typically 140 lb. The 0-6-0 goods engines had the same size of cylinder but the wheels were of 4 ft 6 inch diameter. In the 1860s a three-cylinder 0-6-0 engine was built . After the electrification of 1904, steam autocar trains composed of a Fletcher BTP 0-4-4T engine between two coaches operated on the Monkseaton- Shields section, operating a shuttle passenger service over the Avenue branch from Blyth to North Shields. =Electrification= Residential travel into Newcastle and Gateshead developed considerably in the latter years of the nineteenth century. Street-running tramcars were introduced from 1878, and in 1901 the system was converted to electric traction, representing a considerable step forward in convenience for the public, and competition for suburban railways. The total number of passengers booked in the Newcastle area in 1901 was 9,847,000 but by 1903 this had fallen to 5,887,000. In response, the North Eastern Railway electrified what became known as the North Tyneside Loop, much of which was part of the Blyth and Tyne system, between New Bridge Street, Backworth, Monkseaton and Wallsend. This was the first part of a network of suburban electrified routes, the Tyneside suburban electric system. The Railway Magazine recorded the opening: > On Tuesday, March 29, 1904, at 12.50 p.m. electric working for public > traffic was put into operation on the North-Eastern Railway; the line on > which the new motive power is employed being that between New Bridge Street > Station (Newcastle) and Benton, a distance of 4 miles 7 chains... The > outward journey took 11 minutes, the inward 12 minutes, being a reduction of > 25 per cent, on the time occupied by steam-hauled trains... There are 37 > miles of double and four-way track [in the North Tyneside suburban network], > equivalent to some 82 miles of single track, over the whole of which the > passenger service will in the near future be worked electrically. For the > present the goods traffic will be mainly operated by steam, although two > electric goods locomotives are to be used on a portion of the system... > The third rail system is adopted, the current being picked up by a contact > shoe from this rail... and after passing through the motors returns to the > dynamos [at the generating station] by the ordinary running rails. The > current is generated at high pressure, 6,000 volts three-phase alternating, > at the central power station, and transmitted to sub-stations, where it is > converted into low pressure 600 volt direct current, and fed on to the > rails. The electric power was to be procured from the Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply Company. The trains would be multiple units: \\"each train consists of three bogie coaches, one a third-class smoking vehicle, the centre a third- class carriage for non-smokers, and the last a first-class coach with luggage compartment.\\"Electric Train Services on the North-Eastern Railway in Railway Magazine, April 1904 New carriage sheds were erected at South Gosforth and as part of the preparation for electrification, a spur was built from south to west at Benton, for empty stock to reach the sheds from the main line. It opened on 1 May 1903. A south to east curve was opened nearby on 1 July 1904 giving express electric trains access between the coast and Newcastle via the main line. A north spur from South Gosforth East to South Gosforth West was opened in 1905 (associated with the Ponteland branch), giving empty stock trains easier access to the carriage depot. In 1902 a north to west curve was authorised at the Benton crossing, but not built at the time. In fact it was commissioned in 1940 to give an alternative route from the main line into Newcastle in the event of enemy attack closing the main line. =Ponteland branch= In 1905 the Ponteland branch opened; it left the former Blyth and Tyne system by a junction at South Gosforth. It was built under Light Railway legislation. As a speculative line it was intended to electrify it when residential traffic had built up sufficiently. However the results were disappointing, and the passenger service was operated throughout its life by a steam autocar. A stub from Ponteland to Darras Hall was opened on 1 October 1913, and fared no better. Both lines closed to passengers on 17 June 1929. A goods service continued to Darras Hill until 1954, to Ponteland until 1967, and to a private siding at Callerton until 1989. In 1922 there were six weekday passenger trains on the branch with an additional Saturday train; only three ran through to Darras Hall. The Metro route to Newcastle Airport now follows part of the line of route. =Manors connection= Although trains from the Tynemouth part of the Blyth and Tyne section could run direct to Newcastle Central station, the South Gosforth line terminated at New Bridge Street. The terminus was only a short distance from the former Newcastle and North Shields Railway main line at Manors, and in 1909 a short connecting line was laid in, enabling through running to and from Central station. Although trains could now run Central to Central by a circular route, for some years this was not done, and only trains from Central to South Gosforth used the connection, other services continuing to terminate at New Bridge Street. From 1 March 1917 the arrangement was rationalised, and trains ran throughout over the connecting line/. =Collywell Bay line= Starting in 1912 North Eastern Railway constructed a branch line from a junction a mile to the north of Monkseaton station to Seaton Sluice, the site of a proposed housing development. It was to be part of the electric network, and the North Eastern Railway felt that \\"Seaton Sluice\\" was an unattractive name to encourage new residents, so it was determined to call the station \\"Collywell Bay\\". The two mile long line was to have one intermediate stop at Brierdene. Construction was well advanced, with an anticipated opening date of November 1914, but was halted at the commencement of World War I, and in 1917 the track was removed for use in France and recycling elsewhere. A mile long section of the track was reinstated so that a rail-mounted naval gun could be deployed on it. After the war the line was left unfinished; in 1924 a review estimated that rehabilitation would cost ¬£50,000, and the scheme was shelved. In 1931 the branch was formally abandoned. =Walker Gate fire= In August 1918 a disastrous fire took place in the carriage sheds at Walker Gate. As well as the damage to the building, thirty-four vehicles from the electric fleet were destroyed, and many others badly damaged. A scratch service of mixed steam and electric traffic was instituted and replacement vehicles hurriedly ordered, but it was not until 1922 that a full fleet, and a normal train service, could be counted on. South Gosforth car sheds were considerably expanded at this time. =After 1923= System map of the Blyth and Tyne section of the North Eastern Railway in 1922The Railways Act 1921 resulted in the main line railways of Great Britain being \\"grouped\\" in 1923; the North Eastern Railway became part of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In turn the railways of Great Britain were nationalised in 1948, and the former NER lines became the major component of the North Eastern Region of British Railways. Blyth rose steadily to prominence in exporting coal and extensive further staiths were provided there between 1926 and 1928. Over six million tons of coal were exported annually in the 1930s; about 90% of coal exported comes from collieries within six miles. In the period after World War II until 1970, boat trains from London ran to Tyne Commission Quay via Percy Main in connection with Scandinavian ferry services. There was a connecting curve between the North Shields line and the B&T; line; the B&TR; had a Percy Main station actually on the curve. The boat trains ran from Newcastle on to the curve as far as Percy Main North. There they reversed and passing under the North Shields line they ran on to the Tyne Improvement Commission network to reach the Quay. Passenger services were withdrawn from the lines to and in 1964. Faced with declining passenger business and the requirement for considerable expenditure to renew the electrical systems and rolling stock on the electric network, the remaining routes reverted to diesel traction in 1967. Tyne and Wear Metro Renewed attention to suburban public transport in the 1970s led to the creation of the Tyne and Wear Metro, a light rapid transit system, much of which operated on the old Blyth and Tyne routes. The modernisation of the existing routes and the necessary conversion to light rapid transit configurations resulted in suspension of the existing passenger services on the affected routes in 1978 - 1979. The Metro services started operation in 1980. Some of the former routes were retained for heavy rail operation of mineral and goods trains, but the decline of the Northumberland Coalfield in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this traffic. The Metro system uses the Blyth and Tyne route from Newcastle to South Gosforth and on through Benton to Tynemouth; in addition the Airport branch uses part of the Ponteland branch, constructed after the end of the independent existence of the B&TR; but regarded as part of the B&TR; network. Proposed reinstatement of passenger services =1990-2009: Early proposals= There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the ex-B&TR; system since the 1990s. Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) endorsed the proposal in 1998. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services to the north-eastern part of the B&TR; system. It would have included reopening stations at ', ', ' (for Blyth) and '. =2013-2017: Initial plans and the Ashington, Blyth & Tyne Line project= In the early 2010s Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. NCC received the GRIP 1 study in March 2014 and in June 2015 it commissioned a more detailed GRIP 2 feasibility study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between and Ashington was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The 2016 GRIP 2 study envisaged a project (at the time referred to as the Ashington, Blyth & Tyne Line (ABT)), at an estimated cost of ¬£191 million, involving construction of new or reopened stations at Northumberland Park (for interchange with the Tyne and Wear Metro), either ' or Seaton Delaval, Newsham, Blyth Park & Ride, Bedlington, Ashington and ' (for the Woodhorn Colliery Museum and Northumberland Archives) with a potential end to end journey time of 37 minutes. At the time, it was suggested that detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that it was proceeding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail. However, such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project, but the report failed to deliver on this. =2019-present: Revised plans and the Northumberland Line project= The county council has, however, continued to develop the project and, on 8 February 2019, chartered a train from Northern that carried the then Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling and other dignitaries over part of the route (now rechristened the Northumberland Line) between Morpeth and Newsham, after which NNC announced an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. It is envisaged that passenger trains could be introduced as early as 2022. A Strategic Outline Business Case for the project, prepared by AECOM and SLC Rail in March 2019, reiterated the economic benefits of the project, again suggesting that it could boost the local economy by up to ¬£70 million. The Campaign for Better Transport has identified the line as a Priority 1 candidate for reopening. The revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose a four-phase project allowing a reduction in the initial cost of the scheme; the initial phase, at an estimated ¬£90 million, would see the creation of new or reopened stations at Northumberland Park, Newsham, Bedlington and Ashington as well as some line-speed upgrades, extension of the double track section further to the south of Newsham, creation of turn-back facilities at Ashington and some level crossing upgrades or closures. Two further stations, at Seaton Delaval and Blyth Bebside (formerly Blyth Park & Ride), and additional line-speed improvements are suggested for Phase 2 while Phases 3 and 4 would deliver further line-speed improvements (including signalling upgrades) and an additional passing-loop at Seaton Delaval respectively. Previously proposed stations at Seghill and Woodhorn appear to have been dropped from the scheme. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transforming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the reintroduction of passenger services between Newcastle and Ashington, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment for the project. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris visited Bedlington station in January 2020, and announced a grant of ¬£1.5 million to Northumberland County Council towards development of the proposals. By February, Northumberland County Council had agreed a further ¬£10 million in funding to progress the proposals, with the possibility of construction beginning as early as June 2022, for a September 2023 opening.

It was originally serialized in 1970 as The Misspelled Magishun in If magazine. The book is about the efforts of a stranded astronaut to escape from a primitive world, showing how sufficiently advanced technology could be perceived as magic by its natives. Plot summary The plot concerns the efforts of an astronaut and geologist/anthropologist, known to the natives as \\"Purple\\", to escape from a primitive world on which he is stranded and return to his people. The events are seen from the perspective of Lant, one of the natives, who becomes, in the course of the novel, Speaker (chieftain) of his people. The natives, a fur covered people, believe in magic and the book shows how sufficiently advanced technology would be perceived by a primitive society. Purple lands in an egg- shaped vehicle. He casually disrupts the lives of Lant's people, and thoughtlessly demeans Shoogar, the village magician. Shoogar gets revenge by destroying Purple's vehicle, which results in an atomic explosion. Many of the villagers are dead or injured: the rest, including Lant and Shoogar, are forced to flee. Purple is presumed dead. The villagers eventually wind up on a fertile peninsula, which, as the summer approaches, is rapidly becoming an island (thanks to the influence of the two suns, the shorelines on this world are somewhat variable). To the annoyance of the existing inhabitants of the area, the villagers contrive to be trapped in the verdant area by the rising seas. The villagers are less happy when they learn that Purple is here, serving ineffectively as local magician, having succeeded the incumbent, Dorthi, by killing him by landing on him in a fall from the sky in an impact suit. Lant's people wish to flee, but have nowhere to go. Lant, who becomes Speaker of the villagers more or less by default, and the local Speaker persuade the two magicians to swear to a peace treaty. Purple can call his mother ship to get him, but must return to the distant area of the old village to do so. Everyone is stranded on the island for a considerable length of time. Purple conceives the idea of fabricating a flying machine to return him to the area. He persuades his villagers (who are actually anxious to get rid of him) and Lant's, to join in the scheme. The ship will have balloons, sails, and pedal-driven steering. A good part of the book deals with the tribulations of Purple in trying to create this work, beyond the technology of the local people. He creates 'aircloth' (a thin, airtight cloth), a rubber-equivalent, and splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. He is successful in building the ship. But in so doing, he has changed the lives of the villagers forever. Not only do they have these new technologies, but he has created problems with crime, intoxication, the ecology, and has altered the relationship between the sexes. In addition, he has introduced money into the culture. Purple, Shoogar, Lant, and Lant's adult two sons take off for the old village. They get there, and Purple is able to summon the mother ship and depart. There is a brief epilogue---after the return home, Lant notes that a new flying machine, much larger than the first, is to be built, thus continuing the industrial revolution started by Purple. Reception Lester del Rey gave the novel a mixed review, finding the comedy of the novel's first segment incongruous with the more seriously played finish, concluding \\"It's not at all a bad book -- but it isn't all a good one.\\"\\"The Reading Room\\", If, February 1972, p.157-58 James Nicoll has described it as \\"dreadful tosh\\",Soon Found Out I Was Losing My Mind, by James Nicoll, at James Nicoll Reviews; published April 7, 2017; retrieved May 30, 2017 and noted its \\"astoundingly horrible treatment of women\\".Exhibit A, by James Nicoll, at James Nicoll Reviews, published May 29, 2016; retrieved May 30, 2017 Names Most of the names in the book are jokes primarily dealing with the Science Fiction universe.

The field has advanced from simple logic systems based on a single chemical or physical input to molecules capable of combinatorial and sequential operations such as arithmetic operations i.e. moleculators and memory storage algorithms. For logic gates with a single input, there are four possible output patterns. When the input is 0, the output can be either a 0 or 1. When the input is 1, the output can again be 0 or 1. The four output bit patterns that can arise corresponds to a specific logic type: PASS 0, YES, NOT and PASS 1. PASS 0 always outputs 0, whatever the input. PASS 1 always outputs 1, whatever the input. YES outputs a 1 when the input is 1 and NOT is the inverse YES ‚Äì it outputs a 0 when the input is 1. An example of a YES logic gate is the molecular structure shown below. A \\"1\\" output is given only when sodium ions are present in solution (\\"1\\" input). A YES molecular logic gate receptive to sodium ions Molecular logic gates work with input signals based on chemical processes and with output signals based on spectroscopy. One of the earlier water solution-based systems exploits the chemical behavior of compounds A and B in scheme 1. Scheme 1. Molecular logic gates de Silva 2000 Compound A is a push-pull olefin with the top receptor containing four carboxylic acid anion groups (and non-disclosed counter cations) capable of binding to calcium. The bottom part is a quinoline molecule which is a receptor for hydrogen ions. The logic gate operates as follows. Without any chemical input of Ca2+ or H+, the chromophore shows a maximum absorbance in UV/VIS spectroscopy at 390 nm. When calcium is introduced a blue shift takes place and the absorbance at 390 nm decreases. Likewise addition of protons causes a red shift and when both cations are in the water the net result is absorption at the original 390 nm. This system represents a XNOR logic gate in absorption and a XOR logic gate in transmittance. In compound B the bottom section now contains a tertiary amino group also capable of binding to protons. In this system fluorescence only takes place when both cations available. The presence of both cations hinders photoinduced electron transfer (PET) allowing compound B to fluoresce. In the absence of both or either ion, fluorescence is quenched by PET, which involves an electron transfer from either the nitrogen atom or the oxygen atoms, or both to the anthracenyl group. When both receptors are bound to calcium ions and protons respectively, both PET channels are shut off. The overall result of Compound B is AND logic, since an output of \\"1\\" (fluorescence) occurs only when both Ca2+ and H+ are present in solution, that is, have values as \\"1\\". With both systems run in parallel and with monitoring of transmittance for system A and fluorescence for system B the result is a half-adder capable of reproducing the equation 1+1=2. In a modification of system B not two but three chemical inputs are simultaneously processed in an AND logic gate. An enhanced fluorescence signal is observed only in the presence of excess protons, zinc and sodium ions through interactions with their respective amine, phenyldiaminocarboxylate and crown ether receptors. The processing mode operates similarly as discussed above ‚Äì fluorescence is observed due to the prevention of competing photoinduced electron transfer reactions from the receptors to the excited anthracene fluorophore. The absence of one, two or all three ion inputs results in a low fluorescence output. Each receptor is selective for its specific ion as an increase in the concentration of the other ions does not yield a high fluorescence. The specific concentration threshold of each input must be reached to achieve a fluorescent output in accordance with combinatorial AND logic. This prototype could potentially be extended to point-of-care medical diagnostics application for disease screening in the future. A three-input AND logic gate In a similar set-up, the molecular logic gate illustrated below demonstrates the advancement from redox-fluorescent switches to multi-input logic gates with an electrochemical switch. This two-input AND logic gate incorporates a tertiary amine proton receptor and a tetrathiafulvelene redox donor. These groups, when attached to anthracene can simultaneously process information concerning acid concentration and oxidizing ability of the solution. A two-input AND molecular logic gate sensor for protons and electrons The INHIBIT logic gate illustrated below as provided by Gunnlaugsson et al. incorporates a Tb3+ ion in a chelate complex. This two-input logic gate is the first of its kind and displays non- commutative behaviour with chemical inputs and a phosphorescence output. Whenever dioxygen (input 1) is present, the system is quenched and no phosphorescence is observed (output 0). The second input, H+, must also be present for an output \\"1\\" to be observed. This is understood from a two-input INHIBIT truth table. Two-input INHIBIT logic gate In another XOR logic gate system the chemistry is based on the pseudorotaxane depicted in scheme 3. In organic solution the electron deficient diazapyrenium salt (rod) and the electron rich 2,3-dioxynaphthalene units of the crown ether (ring) self- assemble by formation of a charge transfer complex. An added tertiary amine like tributylamine forms a 1:2 adduct with the diazapyrene and the complex gets dethreaded. This process is accompanied by an increase in emission intensity at 343 nm resulting from freed crown ether. Added trifluoromethanesulfonic acid reacts with the amine and the process is reverted. Excess acid locks the crown ether by protonation and again the complex is dethreaded. Scheme 3. Pseudorotaxane logic gate A full adder system based on fluorescein is able to compute 1+1+1=3. Molecular sequential logic is exemplified by D. Margulies et al., where they demonstrate a molecular keypad lock resembling the processing capabilities of an electronic security device which is equivalent to incorporates several interconnected AND logic gates in parallel. The molecule mimics an electronic keypad of an automated teller machine (ATM). The output signals are dependent not only on the combination of inputs but also on the correct order of inputs: in other words the correct password must be entered. The molecule was designed using pyrene and fluorescein fluorophores connected by a siderophore, which binds to Fe(III), and the acidic of the solution changes the fluorescence properties of the fluorescein fluorophore. Further development in this field might also see molecular logic gates replace semiconductors in the IT industry. Such molecular systems can theoretically overcome the problems arising when semiconductors approach nano-dimensions. Molecular logic gates are more versatile than their silicon counterparts, with phenomena such as superposed logic unavailable to semiconductor electronics. Dry molecular gates such as the one demonstrated by Avouris and colleagues prove to be possible substitutes for semiconductor devices due to their small size, similar infrastructure and data processing abilities. Avouris revealed a NOT logic gate composed of a bundle of carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are doped differently in adjoining regions creating two complementary field effect transistors. The bundle operates as a NOT logic gate only when satisfactory conditions are met. New potential applications of chemical logic gates continue to be explored. A recent study illustrates the application of a logic gate for photodynamic therapy. A bodipy dye attached to a crown-ether and two pyridyl groups separated by spacers (as shown below) works according to an AND logic gate. The molecule works as a photodynamic agent upon irradiation at 660 nm under conditions of relatively high sodium and proton ion concentrations by converting triplet oxygen to cytotoxic singlet oxygen. This prototypical example would take advantage of the higher sodium levels and lower pH in tumor tissue compared to the levels in normal cells. When these two cancer-related cellular parameters are satisfied, a change is observed in the absorbance spectrum. This technique could be useful for the treatment of malignant tumors as it is non-invasive and specific. Two-input AND logic gate by Ozlem and Akkaya with photodynamic therapeutic applications A molecular logic gate can processes modulators much like the set up seen in de Silva‚Äôs ‚ÄòProof-of- principle‚Äô but incorporating different logic gates on the same molecule. Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below). When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660 nm, XOR and INHIBIT logic gates are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in THF reveal an absorbance peak at 565 nm and an emission peak at 660 nm. Addition of an acid results in a hypsochromic shift of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting in the absence of both PET and ICT. Due to the great difference in emission intensity, this single molecule is capable of carrying out an arithmetic operation; subtraction at a nanoscale level.

He won the Viareggio, Gatto, and Montale prizes. Biography Dario Bellezza was born in Rome on 5 September 1944. After his studies at a liceo classico in his native city, from which he graduated in 1962, he worked for several Italian literary and poetry magazines: Paragone, Carte segrete, Bimestre, Periferia, and Il Policordo.Mariano D'Amora. Dario Bellezza (1944-1996). Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies, published by CRC Press, 2007. , , 1504 pages Bellezza entered the Roman intellectual world in the mid-1960s when, thanks to literary critic and writer Enzo Siciliano, he became increasingly close to Sandro Penna, Aldo Palazzeschi, Attilio Bertolucci, Alberto Moravia, and Elsa Morante, who eventually became a confidant. The decade from 1950-1960 was a period in which the working class, the Italian Communist Party, the trade unions, and all their hopes for radical cultural change were dramatically defeated. The political and economic growth of the Christian Democrat middle class and the new, changed Freemasonries prevailed. Bellezza, thus, lived in a political-cultural era convulsed by the ideological confrontations of the 1960s and the subversive ideological line of the aggressive neoavant-garde that struggled against conventional linguistic codes.D'Amora, 2007. From the early 1960s on, Bellezza collaborated with the magazine Nuovi argomenti, becoming associate director shortly before his death. When Invettive e licenze (Invectives and Licenses) appeared in 1971, it was hailed by Pier Paolo Pasolini in his introduction: \\"Here is the best poet of the new generation\\". Invettive e licenze, notable for its technical rigor, depicts people overwhelmed by bitterness, shame, feelings of guilt, alienation, scandal, and sexual perversions. The poems also express a constant, thinly veiled desire for death.Cordelli, F. Il poeta postumo. Consenza: Lerici, 1978. Since 1978 has begun a productive collaboration with Pellicanolibri, with the series \\"Inediti rari e diversi\\", publishing texts by Alberto Moravia, Renzo Paris, Gianfranco Rossi, Goliarda Sapienza and Anna Maria Ortese, for her with Beppe Costa and Adele Cambria he will manage to enforce for the first time the Bacchelli‚Äôs law, an annuity which is intended to poets and writers in need. Bellezza was a bourgeois, as were many other intellectuals, but differed from them, according to Pasolini, in being \\"the first poet bourgeois to judge himself\\". Pasolini had a profound affection for Bellezza's work and his artistic experience. The young poet reciprocated this feeling, and also was deeply grateful to Elsa Morante for what he called his poetic apprenticeship.Battisti, S. and M. Bettarini. Chi √® il poeta?. Milan: Gammalibri, 1980. In 1981, enraged by the publication of the \\"obscene\\" photographs of the dead Pasolini \\"in tutta la loro gelida, disarmante crudezza... nudo, esposto, con tutte le macabre ferite esibite del suo 'sacro' martirio\\" (in their icy, disarming rawness... naked, exposed, with all the grisly wounds exhibited of his 'sacred' martyrdom), Bellezza wrote the biographical essay Morte di Pasolini (Death of Pasolini).Moliterno, G. Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture. CRC Press, 2000, , , 677 pages.Gregorini, M. Il male di Dario Bellezza: vita e morte di un poeta. Stampa alternativa/ Nuovi equilibri, 2006, , , 208 pages. In 1983, he published io (me), the lack of capital letters intentional. In this work, Bellezza lightly but concretely describes his everyday life and the mediocre desperation of his loves in ample detail. The poet associates life with insomnia, a curse that constantly pursues him: In the book, he describes suffering from insomnia because, as a highly educated bourgeois and homosexual bigot, he feels tortured by a feeling of guilt and driven by the many contradictions that struggle against each other. Such contradictions are the quintessence of his existence: In his guilt-ridden insomniac persona, he anticipated the poetry that would be too often adopted in the 1980s, that of the artist-outcast.Cucchi, M. and S. Giovanardi. Poeti italiani del secondo novecento 1945-1995. Milan: Mondadori, 1996. Bellezza was consumed by anguish and by the relics of (a now mocking) sense of hope:Esposito, V. L'altro Novecento nella poesia italiana: critica e testi. Bastogi, 1999. He is reduced to corrosive accounts of his own social condition:Golino, C. L. Dario Bellezza. Italian Quarterly, Dante Alighieri Society of Los Angeles, University of Massachusetts Boston, v. 31, 1990. The difficulty of homosexual life in Rome, particularly the requirements of secrecy and clandestinity of the love act, is a staple of Bellezza's poetic and prosaic writing. In Bellezza's first novel, L'innocenza (Innocence, 1971), Nino, the protagonist, consciously chooses the perdition and corruption of a living homosexual hell. In Bellezza's infernal world, homosexuality can be nothing else but prostitution and neurotically masochistic obsessions: in Lettere da Sodoma (Letters from Sodom, 1972), his conclusion is that everything is Hell and that the only salvation is the systematic refusal of the self.Gregorini, M. Il male di Dario Bellezza: vita e morte di un poeta. Stampa alternativa/ Nuovi equilibri, 2006, , , 208 pages.Gregorini, M. Morte di Bellezza: storia di una verit√† nascosta. Castelvecchi, 1997, , , 143 pages. Bellezza won the Viareggio prize in 1976 for Morte segreta, the Gatto prize in 1991 for Invettive e licenze, the Montale prize in 1994 for L'avversario, and for the play Ordalia della croce he received the Fondi la Postora prize in 1994. He died of AIDS in Rome on 31 March 1996. That year, a poetry prize was established in his name.

Brammo also developed and sold a range of electric motorcycles via the company's website and motorcycle dealers throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. On January 15, 2015, Polaris Industries announced that it had purchased the entire electric motorcycle business from Brammo. Production of an electric motorcycle, the rebadged Victory Empulse, commenced at Polaris' factory in Spirit Lake, IA during the second half of 2015. It was announced on October 16, 2017 that Brammo's remaining assets would be acquired by Cummins, with the deal expected to close by the end of the year. History Brammo Motorsports began in Craig Bramscher's garage after he visited several Ferrari and Lamborghini dealerships in Hollywood and Los Angeles, California, looking for a supercar that he could comfortably sit in. Bramscher, who was a football player at his high school, Shawnee Mission South, is tall but has described himself as \\"long-waisted, so I sit like I'm tall.\\" Bramscher set out to design and build a car comparable to the McLaren Formula 1 car, but which would comfortably accommodate a tall person weighing . On September 4, 2002, he registered the name \\"Brammo Motorsports\\" with the state of Oregon.Business Name Registry # 101335-93, Oregon Secretary of State.> A Brammo-manufactured Ultima Brammo began importing the Ultima Can Am in an attempt to understand at a basic level the components, tools, and processes needed to manufacture a complete vehicle. The company continued to import the cars from Ultima in component form, assemble them, and sell them to customers. Customers were offered \\"build journals,\\" which enabled them to watch their vehicle being built in near real- time online. =2004‚Äì2008= Enertia GT The Enertia GT was a car planned for production, intended to be powered by a naturally aspirated Falconer V12 engine. However, it has since been announced that the project has shifted to making the GT a battery electric vehicle to compete with the Tesla Roadster (2008). Pro GT and Rogue GT Brammo applied for a trademark of \\"Pro GT\\" in April 2004.USPTO, IC 012. US 019 021 023 031 035 044. Brammo finalized the design for the Brammo Motorsports Pro GT and hired Brian Wismann as the lead designer prior to building the prototype. The Pro GT prototype had a V12 engine producing . Brammo commissioned a six-speed transverse synchro- mesh gearbox with Xtrac, Inc., of Berkshire, England. They also built a custom Falconer V12 engine. Brammo changed the name of the Pro GT to the Rogue GT. They also imported some Gardner Douglas T70s, but demand for the vehicle was not sufficient. In 2006, Brammo executed an assignment of its interest in the trademark \\"Rogue\\" to Nissan Motors,USPTO Trademark Assignment, Ser. No. 78820802, Reg. No. 3522579, Recorded October 6, 2006. which introduced the Nissan Rogue, a compact crossover SUV in October 2007. Ariel Atom Brammo Ariel Atom In early 2005, Brammo purchased a license to produce the Ariel Atom, an exo-skeletal vehicle designed by Nik Smart while he was a transport design student at Coventry University. Brammo's license allowed the company to produce the vehicle for the North American market only. After it secured the license from Ariel CEO Simon Saunders, Brammo reverse-engineered the vehicle, making several improvements along the way, and began production. The company could not secure the Honda engines which were installed in the UK versions of the car, so it approached GM and was able to obtain the supercharged GM Ecotec engine, although a limited run of ten of the Atoms came equipped with Honda K20A engines. The company sold just over 130 of the cars during a 20 month period. Jay Leno bought one of them and wrote an extensive review of it for Popular Mechanics. Enertia Powercycle and Brammo, Inc. Brammo Enertia PowercyclesBrammo's experience with building supercars, coupled with its research of electric drivetrains and then-current battery technology led to the belief that with the power-to-weight ratio and energy density of lithium batteries, an EV was possible, but that the vehicle's weight was a crucial concern. The decision was made to produce a lighter motorcycle. Brammo focused on designing and building the Enertia powercycle prototype. After completing the prototype, the company met with investors and determined that Brammo Motorsports needed to become Brammo, Inc., and that it would thereafter focus fully on electric vehicles. The name \\"Brammo, Inc.\\" was registered in August 2008. In September 2008, Brammo raised a $10 million round from Best Buy, Venture Capital, Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, and others. =2009= Best Buy sales agreement In February 2009, Brammo announced that the Enertia would be sold at Best Buy stores on the West Coast, with a gradual roll-out to the electronic retailer's stores nationwide. Bramscher said, \\"what we're selling is a lot closer to consumer electronics than to transportation.\\" He indicated that basic repairs and maintenance would be carried out by the Geek Squad crew while more intensive work would be performed at various service centers around the country.

Top speed is in excess of 100 miles per hour. Summer 2011 delivery was projected for orders placed in July 2010. The 2011 delivery date was later extended into 2012 due to the decision to incorporate a gearbox into the production model. Flextronics outsourcing In September 2010, Brammo announced an agreement to outsource motorcycle production to Flextronics. Brammo said the deal was made because of Flextronics' ability to supply Brammo with all its electronics needs and to move manufacturing closer to overseas consumers, rather than building on US assembly lines. Enertia Plus electric motorcycle Brammo Enertia Plus revealed at EICMA In October 2010, Brammo announced a new model of its Enertia motorcycle, called the Enertia Plus. Set for delivery in 2011, the Enertia Plus will have a 6.0 kWh Brammo Power Lithium Ion battery pack. According to CEO Bramscher, the Enertia Plus is a zero-emissions motorcycle that will travel 80 miles on one charge, over 60 miles per hour, and should take about 6 hours to fully power up at any electric vehicle (EV) charging station with Level 1 capabilities. =2011= Engage and Encite models Brammo Engage at the MinimotoIn May 2011, Brammo announced two new models of electric motorcycle, the Engage and the Encite. The Engage is a full-sized dirtbike, available in both motorcross (offroad) and supermoto (onroad, mostly) variants. The Encite MMX Pro, the smaller of the two bikes, was described as a more hardcore racing version. Along with the announcement of the two bikes came the announcement that the company had partnered with SMRE, an Engineering and Design firm based in Umbertide, Italy. SMRE had designed the mechatronic six-speed gearbox that the new bikes, in prototype form, were using. TTXGP On May 14 and 15, 2011, at Infineon Raceway, Brammo's Empulse RR racing motorcycle won the first two races of the TTXGP North American Series, also known as the A123 Infineon Round. The motorcycle was ridden by Steve Atlas, an AMA credentialed racer and a contributing editor for Motorcycle- USA.com. During the race on Sunday, the Empulse RR broke the track record for electric motorcycles, set the previous year by the Zero-Agni machine, ridden by Shawn Higbee. In July 2011, Brammo announced it had entered a partnership with TTXGP to provide race-ready rides for the TTXGP electric racing series for the 2013 season. Brammo indicated that it would provide box-stock Empulse motorcycles to the TTXGP through Mavizen, the electric motorcycle startup launched by TTXGP founder Azhar Hussain. Mavizen and Brammo would develop a \\"race kit\\" including racing bodywork, unspecified \\"race performance upgrades\\" and track-side tech support. Although Brammo's Empulse RR racing motorcycle took third place at the TTXGP race at Miller Motorsports Park in Utah on the weekend of September 2, 2011, its position and prior points earned in the racing series guaranteed it the title of TTXGP North American Champion. The electric racing motorcycle was piloted by Steve Atlas, who had given the team consistent speed and performance throughout the 2011 season. Acquisitions and investments In September 2011, Brammo acquired European bike rental company QuantyaParx. Brammo said they would be expanding the business to the United States. In October 2011, Polaris Industries announced an investment in Brammo. Polaris had previously produced an electric version of its Ranger Side-by-Side, and acquired Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) from Chrysler. An analyst concluded that Polaris intends to add electric drivetrains to its ATV and motorcycle product lineup, but were likely to wait for further technology advancements before bringing them to snowmobiles. Hong Kong police and municipal use In October 2011, Hong Kong's Government Logistics Department announced that it would be replacing Hong Kong Police Force and Water Supplies Department gasoline-powered motorcycles with Brammo Enertia Plus \\"LE\\" (Law Enforcement) electric motorcycles. The Hong Kong Police Force had been using several Enertia motorcycles as part of pilot project for over a year. =2012= A Brammo Empulse at charging station, August 2012 In December, a United States customer took delivery of the first Empulse R.

It was primarily recorded in a basement in Port Townsend, Washington and was released in 2001. The album has the dubious distinction of being released in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, the date of the attacks on the World Trade Center, and coincidentally containing the song \\"NYC's Like a Graveyard\\". The song \\"Anyone Else but You\\" was used in the Academy Award- winning 2007 film Juno. The film and soundtrack also contain a version of the song performed by the two lead actors in the film, Ellen Page and Michael Cera.  Critical reception  In a positive review for NME magazine, music critic Kitty Empire called The Moldy Peaches \\"extremely amusing and often brilliant\\" because of its endearing songs and absurdist lyrics, which she felt distinguishes the band from other indie acts. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice found Dawson's songwriting more endearing and vulnerable than the \\"ambitious\\" Green, but said that they are both \\"cute folkies who break without warning into punk noise and sing a deeply catchy song called 'Who's Got the Crack,' cute floozies who'll fuck anybody with anything when that's their mood or stage of life\\". In a less enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone, Jenny Eliscu wrote that the \\"joyously messy\\" album is made up mostly of \\"low-fi, potty-mouthed indie rock\\" and raunchy humor, which listeners will either find \\"hilarious or stupid\\". AllMusic's Daniel Greenwald was more critical and said the Moldy Peaches tried to be funny with their use of provocative language, but sounded like a witless, untalented version of the indie band Beat Happening. The Moldy Peaches finished 31st in the voting for the Pazz & Jop, an annual critics poll run by The Village Voice. Christgau, the poll's creator, placed it second on his own year-end list. Mojo magazine ranked it 29th on its list of 2001's best records. In a retrospective review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), editor Christian Hoard wrote that the album showcased a songwriting duo who could successfully combine \\"oddball juvenalia and superb melodies\\". In his ballot for Rolling Stones decade-end poll, Christgau later named The Moldy Peaches the 11th best album of the 2000s.

Renegades.http://www.gogades.com/landing/index The stadium currently seats 19,468 people but has plenty of standing room which can accommodate close to 24,000 people. When Memorial Stadium was opened in 1955 it originally seated 16,500. It is named to honor the war dead of World War I and World War II. On December 14, 2019, Memorial Stadium will host the CCCAA California Junior College Football Title Game.https://www.cccaasports.org/landing/index History Memorial Stadium was completed in 1955 before the remainder of the campus opened for students in 1956 when Bakersfield College would move from its original location on the downtown campus of Bakersfield High School where it was founded in 1913, to the new campus in Northeast Bakersfield. Bakersfield College is the 2nd oldest junior college in California behind Santa Barbara City College. Ad hoc football squads were first created in the 1920s resulting in the moniker nickname \\"Renegades\\" before official interscholastic collegiate competition was started. Memorial Stadium was the first structure to be completed at the new campus site. Football games were being played on site before classes were ever held on the new campus. In fact, during the first semester of classes students were served lunches out of the concession stands because the cafeteria was still under construction.Bakersfield Memorial Stadium . Bakersfield Magazine. October 2010. Accessed: 11-01-2011. For its first 40 years, Memorial Stadium enjoyed huge success based on its attendance of Bakersfield College football games by the local community. Lasting into the early 1990s, it was unusual for a B.C. football game not to have 12,000 fans or more in the stands. Games have been locally televised live and on tape-delay in the past. Attendance was so large that the college's academic extracurricular activities were all funded by football ticket sales until the 1990s. The stadium was the home to the first ever junior college bowl game, and California's formerly most prestigious junior college bowl game, the Kern County Shrine Club Potato Bowl. The Potato Bowl, established in 1948, was a fund raiser for the Shriners Hospital for Burned and Crippled Children in Los Angeles. The Potato Bowl no longer exists due to fees demanded by the State Junior College Commission on Athletics (COA) to be a part of the reformed state JC playoff system (The COA is now known as the California Community College Athletic Association or CCCAA). {Note: The Kern County Shrine Club now hosts a youth football version of the Potato Bowl with Golden Empire Youth Football to raise money for the Shriner's Hospital now located in Pasadena}. The J.C. Potato Bowl hence was replaced by the Golden Empire Bowl, which was part of the California J.C. Football State Playoffs, and was supported and sponsored by local businesses. However, the Golden Empire Bowl folded in 2011. Sponsors cited a lack of ticket money for previous bowl games that left them losing money. These sponsors were hoping to break-even with their sponsorship every year as a way to serve their community. The stadium occasionally hosts B.C.'s soccer games on its pitch. Professional and international teams have also played in exhibitions (friendly's). However, due to the layout of the field within the track the field's length and width are smaller than your typical soccer field. Memorial Stadium hosted the 2012 CCCAA state football title game where Bakersfield College defeated City College of San Francisco in front of a crowd of over 16,000. Memorial Stadium has had numerous Renegade football games exceed attendances of 20,000, particularly in post-season games with a national title or state title berth at stake. The largest ever crowd, however, was 23,701 for a high school football game between Bakersfield High School and Bishop Amat Memorial High School from La Puente on Saturday, October 1, 1994. Bishop Amat, with a #1 national ranking, won 34-3. Memorial Stadium features an all weather track that was completely replaced in July 2019. It hosts high school and junior college track events. The track was once the training track for the Soviet Union track teams when they visited the United States. It also was the track on which Jim Ryun established a world-record in the one-mile run in 1967 when the track surface was made of crushed brick. This world record run was featured on ABC's Wide World of Sports. The track has hosted A.A.U. events and state championship high school meets. \\\\--Celebrating the 30-24 National Title victory over Fullerton in the 1988 Potato Bowl with 18,000+ fans. Memorial Stadium occasionally hosts high school football games. Until the early 1990s, it was the Friday night home field of both Highland High School and East Bakersfield High School on alternating weekends. Changes by B.C.'s college president increased the field usage fees in the mid-1990s which led both schools to finally install lights on their own fields after decades of renting Memorial Stadium. Presently, Memorial Stadium is used for high school football games only when it is deemed that an existing high school field is too small to handle the anticipated large crowds; this generally occurs only during playoffs. On Friday, August 29, 2014, Memorial Stadium hosted two high school games billed as the Kick Off Classic. Local schools Ridgeview and Frontier played in the first game with Ridgeview winning 42-21. The featured second game pitted Southern California power Oaks Christian from Westlake Village (ranked #19 in California) against perennial Central Section power and defending State Division 1 champion Bakersfield High (ranked #11 in California) won by Bakersfield 34-21. Memorial Stadium has hosted a high school event like this before in the mid-1990s. A series was created featuring the top three high schools from Bakersfield and the Fresno area. An annual triple header was played twice at Memorial Stadium and once in Clovis at Lamonica Stadium before interest waned after three seasons. This series featured Bakersfield High, Foothill High, and West High from Bakersfield against the Fresno-area schools Clovis High, Clovis West High, and Buchanan High. On January 7, 2017, Memorial Stadium hosted an outdoor professional hockey game. The Bakersfield Condors (American Hockey League affiliate of the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers) presented the Condorstown Outdoor Classic. The Bakersfield Condors hosted the Ontario Reign (American Hockey League affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings) in a game played in a pouring rain storm. The Condors won in Overtime. The game was preceded the previous day by an All-Star game featuring various celebrities and NHL hockey legends which had teams coached by Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille. In the days leading up to the event the temporary rink hosted public skating sessions and stick-time hockey games for the public. Facilities Bakersfield Memorial Stadium bowl The stadium structure was retrofitted and overhauled in the late 1990s. All seats are reserved and are either aluminum benches with backs, or bucket style seats with arm rests. The lower half of the stadium, which was built into a pre-existing ravine, is enclosed with a horseshoe-shaped open end that faces to the southwest and offers views of downtown Bakersfield and the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. Consequently, this offers an ideal setting for track events as there is a minimal amount of wind on the floor of the stadium that interferes with events and the acceptance of records as the prevailing northwesterly winds blow over the nearby bluffs and above the track and field surface. Consequently, winds very seldom affect games or track events. The field is so shielded from the prevailing wind that people who are often very warm or hot on the field will get a noticeable chill when they move to the top of the upper deck or on the roof of the press box. The upper decks are built of steel-reinforced concrete and sit opposite each other overlooking their respective sidelines. On top of each upper deck are four light standards with 28 lights on each standard that provide field lighting. The lights were last replaced and upgraded in the late 1980s and offer a brilliantly lit playing surface. The visiting-side (eastern) upper deck features an enclosed, partitioned press box with rooms for each team's coaching staff, radio broadcasts, and media. Teams dress in the nearby Dr. Romain Clerou Field House, located up the hill from the field next to the gym and swimming pool complex. The field house contains B.C.'s practice and game locker room and offers an adjacent locker room for a visiting team with showers. Visiting teams now use the women's locker room on the north side of the gymnasium to dress. Bakersfield Memorial Stadium The field and stadium are unusual in that it is not on a traditional north-south axis from goal post to goal post. Due to being built into a pre-existing ravine the axis of the field runs at an approximate northeast-southwest angle. The northeast end of the stadium is closed into the top of the ravine which was filled in to build a parking lot with a concourse connecting each side of the stadium. Most football fields are built on a north-south axis with the press box on the western sideline so that the press box is not looking into the setting sun. Memorial Stadium's press box is built so that when you are looking down onto the field the sun is in your eyes to your left. The press box was built on this side so that it would overlook the track's finish line which could only be built on the eastern side of the stadium due to the closed end on the north end of the stadium. If the finish line was on the western side then it would be out of view of most of the spectators and the press box would have an indirect angle of observation. Because of this emphasis on track and field the scoreboard operator was and still is positioned at the finish line on the field near the northern 30-yard line. The use of a clock operator on the field at Memorial Stadium is the last remaining junior college site in California to do so. This necessitates the use of a spotter on the roof of the press box to relay down, distance, and the yard line to the scoreboard operator with a walkie-talkie. Another quirk due to the odd angle of the stadium is the naming of the two seating areas. The campus side of the stadium is officially called the northern side and the Mt. Vernon Avenue side is called the southern side. Most people refer to the campus side as the western side and the Mt. Vernon Avenue side as the eastern side. Because the stadium was built prior to the Americans With Disabilities Act there are no elevators or escalators. It is 64 steps from the bottom row to the top row of the lower deck. From there to get to the press box you need to go behind the superstructure to enter the steps to the upper deck mezzanine, then go up to the entrance to the seating area, then go up the aisle past 24-rows of upper deck seating to the press box, a tedious workout! The press box is partitioned into two coaches booths, the George Pavletich Memorial Radio Booth named for longtime KERN-1410 AM radio play-by-play announcer George Pavletich, and the P.A. Announcer's booth. Carl Bryan has just completed his 34th year as P.A. Announcer for Renegade Football. His spotters, Chuck Cunningham and Norman Ranallo, have worked with Carl for 33 and 32 years, respectively. A total of 99 seasons between the three of them. The main room is sectioned into an upper and lower seating area for media. There is a small bathroom on the back side of the press box. The roof of the press box is used to film games from, has been used to broadcast live local television coverage of B.C. football games from, and used to broadcast live internet webcasts by visiting teams. Adjacent to Memorial Stadium's playing surface, just beyond the open end, is a long practice natural grass & lighted field where the football team holds its practices. The practice field has also hosted football clinics, Bakersfield Blitz football practices, Native American pow-wows, and carnivals. A campus renovation is in progress as of 2019 that will see a brand new gymnasium built adjacent to the campus-side seating of Memorial Stadium. This will allow teams to dress at field level without having to walk up-and-down a steep concrete ramp in their plastic cleats resulting in many players over the years slipping and falling. This new facility will be started in 2020 and is scheduled to be completed in 2022. The current gymnasium, the Gil Bishop Sports Center, will be demolished.

Within the universe of Sin City, they are a group of self-governing prostitutes. During the days of the Gold Rush, when the town of Basin City had just been settled, the Roark family \\"imported\\" a large number of women from across the globe into the open and uncontrolled area, turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city and securing themselves a vast fortune and control over the city. These women ended up forming the district that would become Old Town, the prostitute quarter. In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit. It is suggested by The Big Fat Kill that during this time, Old Town's female residents were subjugated and virtually enslaved under the combined malign influence of politics, pimps and mobsters. Eventually, the women formed a truce with the police department, allowing the women to defend their own turf, drive out the pimps and mobsters and administer vigilante justice to those that wronged them. The cops get a slice of the profits and 'free fun' outside of work hours. If a cop tries to enter the boundaries of Old Town while on duty, he is sent back with his tail between his legs -- usually after being humiliated by the girls --. Nevertheless, he is sent back alive; The Big Fat Kill illustrates the danger of what would happen if a cop were ever discovered to have been murdered on Old Town turf, and the lengths the mob were willing to go to in order to seize control of the neighborhood. The girls themselves are portrayed fairly sympathetically in the series, usually as hookers with hearts of gold in a male-dominated metropolis, while not averse to issuing their own brand of justice on those who cross them. Many of the characters appear as caricatures of popular female stereotypes and pop culture icons, such as Old Town girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Zorro, Southern belles and cowgirls. Leadership Goldie and Wendy, the twin prostitutes who are currently in charge of Old Town, taking control of the neighborhood just prior to the events of A Dame to Kill For. While little is revealed about Goldie initially, and indeed the resemblance between the two is so uncanny that even her onetime lover Marv is fooled upon first meeting Wendy. He surmises that Goldie must have been 'the nice one' after taking several beatings from Wendy (who had thought him responsible for her sister's murder at the beginning of The Hard Goodbye). However, once Wendy comes to understand that Marv's motive is to avenge her sister, she joins his quest and is touched by the lengths he will go to see this through. She softens to him, seeming to empathize with his plight, maybe even developing feelings for him. When Marv is incarcerated pending execution, Wendy comes to him to spend the night. She tells him he can call her Goldie (her sister's name) so that he can pretend to be with the woman he loved and for whom he risked everything. Following his execution, she is shown on at least one occasion wearing Marv's cross around her neck. In the movie, both Goldie and Wendy are played by Jaime King. Enforcers *Gail, a prostitute, dominatrix and one of the authority figures of Old Town, second only to the Twins. Standing 6 feet tall and wearing an outfit made of a combination of leather, fishnet stockings and metal studs, and occasionally bondage masks. She is often seen wielding an Uzi submachine gun. She has a love-hate relationship with Dwight McCarthy, who claims the only reason he is still alive at all is \\"that one fiery night when she was mine\\" and the unreturnable love she feels for him. As of the end of The Big Fat Kill, the status of their relationship is in question, despite the ending of The Big Fat Kill in the movie adaptation, and the events of Family Values. Miller has said on the audio commentary track for the movie that Gail's character is comparable, in many ways, to that of Catwoman. She is played by Rosario Dawson. *Miho, a highly skilled, rollerskate-savvy assassin who trains and protects the women of Old Town. Among her arsenal are twin katana samurai swords, throwing stars in the shape of the Manji symbol, and a Mongolian bow. Popular belief maintains she is not a prostitute. She is played by Devon Aoki. In the 2014 sequel, A Dame to Kill For, Aoki is replaced by Jamie Chung. Others *Sally, an Old Town girl and Joey's mistress, who tries to kill her to cover- up his infidelity. Luckily, Dwight, who is photographing him, smashes through a window and saves her. She is played by Juno Temple in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. *Molly, an Old Town girl who is seemingly a doctor and expert surgeon. She saves Dwight's life, at Gail's insistence, when he is repeatedly shot by Ava Lord, and later performs surgery on his face to alter his appearance. *Kelley, Sandy and Denise, a group of Old Town girls who were victims of a group of white slavers led by a man named Manuel. Though their fate is never revealed, Dwight presumably makes sure their jailers were dealt with accordingly. *Becky, a young Old Town prostitute who also works for Herr Wallenquist as a spy, betraying her friends for a chance at a new life. Gail later finds out that Becky is a spy and bites off the left side of her neck, then later shoots her during The Big Fat Kill. In the epilogue of the movie adaptation, Becky is only shot in the arm and escapes to the hospital. In the hospital on an elevator she meets Salesman, a freelance assassin, who presumably kills her. Becky is played by Alexis Bledel. *Dallas, Old Town prostitute and Miho's driver. She is gunned down by mercenaries in The Big Fat Kill. In the movie she is seen wearing a Zorro costume, sometimes with a matching domino mask. *Tammy, an Old Town 'nurse' who Liebowitz uses to taunt and torture John Hartigan. *Carmen, Old Town prostitute with a traumatic past; lover to Daisy. In Family Values, she is accidentally gunned down during a hit on the supporting character Bruno, carried out by the Magliozzi Crime Family. *Daisy, Carmen's lover. She avenges Carmen's death by killing the remaining Magliozzi family members.

They were powerful magnates with estates predominantly in Ruthenian lands of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and they used the Polish coat of arms of Korybut. The family is a cadet branch of the House of Zbaraski. History The family tradition would trace their descent to the Gediminids, but modern historians believe there is more evidence for them to have descended from the Rurikids. According to the Gediminids relation theory, the ancestor of the family was Duke Kaributas (Ruthenian: Dymitr Korybut),Mytsyk, Yu. Vyshnevetski. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. a son of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Algirdas. Kaributas was stripped of the Duchy of Severia and transferred to Volhynia and Podolia where he was given to govern cities of Vinnytsia and Kremenets, while Zbarazh as a private estate. At first Zbarazh was inherited by Ivan, but in 1434 it was passed on to the second son of Korybut Fedor of Nie≈õwie≈º. The latter became a progenitor of such princely families like Porycki, Woronecki, Zbarazski. In the 15th century Wi≈õniowiecki family split away from House of Zbaraski. The family place was city of Wi≈õniowiec (now Vyshnivets). At first Wi≈õniowiecki estates were located predominately in Volhynia, but since 1580s also included on the left-bank Ukraine in a region around Lubny, Romny, others that in the past belonged to the princes Glinski and Daumantas. From their days as Ruthenian nobility, they held the title of Kniaz (prince). By the late 16th century, the family converted from Orthodox to Catholicism and became Polonized. They gained much importance in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, with vast possessions in the 16th to 18th centuries on the territories of today's Ukraine, particularly the town of Vyshnivets (Wi≈õniowiec). Their estates were so vast and their position so powerful that they were known as the most powerful of magnates ‚Äì the \\"little kings\\" (\\"kr√≥lewiƒôta\\"). Their ancestral seat was the Vyshnivets Castle. The family's golden age was the 17th century, when its members accumulated much wealth and influence, held numerous important posts within the Commonwealth. Likely the most notable members of this family were Michael I, king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1669 to 1673, and his father Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki.

Within a few years, the company grew steadily, and Owens, Minor & Bodeker was a leading member in the industry. In 1966 Owens, Minor & Bodeker acquired A&J; Hospital Supply, a local company. This was the company's initial entrance to the market of medical and surgical distribution. By 1970, OMB had opened Cardinal Drug Centers to provide merchandising for more independent drug companies, and within two years the stores stocked more than 25,000 items. Around this time, disposable items were administered to hospitals for various medical procedures. G. Gilmer Minor III, of direct relation to the founder, became CEO in 1984. By 1988, Owens & Minor began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker OMI. It was around this time that revenues earned the company a Fortune 500 title. By 1999, the corporation had refocused its pursuits towards medical supply chain management. Throughout the 2000s, Owens & Minor acquired various medical distributors across the United States, notably the hospital distributor McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., a business unit of McKesson, for $152.1 million, on September 30, 2006.http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Owens_%26_Minor_(OMI) In 2012, Owens & Minor entered the European market, opening offices in Spain, France, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic after the acquisition of Movianto Group.http://investors.owens-minor.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=703789 In 2014, the corporation acquired ArcRoyal, a privately held medical kit company based in Dublin, Ireland.http://investors.owens- minor.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=872035 In 2018, Owens & Minor acquired Halyard Health‚Äôs Surgical & Infection Prevention business for $710 million, the largest acquisition in Owens & Minor‚Äôs history.

Movianto  In 2018 the company‚Äôs Movianto subsidiary won the contract to warehouse and distribute the UK government‚Äôs stock of emergency personal protection equipment, previously managed by DHL. The contract was estimated at ¬£10.5m a year. Following a dispute over payment of rent, Movianto gained a UK High Court injunction in March 2019 to stop Industrial North West LLP, the owner of the industrial estate, from locking the gates and thereby stopping Movianto‚Äôs employees from transferring stock. In 2020 Movianto was criticised after allegedly causing delays to the distribution of the UK government‚Äôs stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following news of shortages in hospitals, the British army was sent to Movianto‚Äôs warehouse to deploy the PPE. An investigation also established that Movianto had previously stored the equipment in a smoke-damaged warehouse that was found to contain asbestos. On 6 April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Owens & Minor sold Movianto to the EHDH Holding Group for $133m, with the sale due to be completed by the end of June. According to the Guardian newspaper, Movianto had lost money for eight years before winning the government contract, and had lost several big contracts.

NASCAR use NASCAR cars are checked before qualifying, before racing, sometimes after a race. The process of checking car body against templates changed significantly with the Car of Tomorrow (CoT). Before the change, there were different templates applied to each car model to make sure it resembled the factory version of the car. The differing templates frequently caused NASCAR to adjust the templates to ensure that all makes of cars were as aerodynamically equal as possible (called \\"parity\\"). There were at least 30 templates used. All Car of Tomorrow models utilize the same templates, since the CoT is designed to not resemble a specific street car. All makes of cars have the same specifications for their bodies. Instead of a series of templates, a single one-piece template is mounted to the frame by NASCAR officials.

It is within the Ruby Mountains Wilderness, which is administered by the Ruby Mountains Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The lake is located at the head of Talbot Canyon at approximately , and at an elevation of 10,184 feet (3104 m). Directly to the south rises Verdi Peak. It has an area of approximately 6 acres (2.4 hectares), and a depth of up to 86 feet (26 m). Verdi Lake is unusual in two respects. It is the highest lake in the Ruby Mountains, and is therefore the last to thaw out in the spring. Also, it does not normally have a surface outlet. Lake water seeps into the soil and emerges as a spring several hundred yards down Talbot Canyon. This is the major source of flow to Talbot Creek, which after exiting the mountains passes near the community of Lamoille, merges with Lamoille Creek, which then meanders down Lamoille Valley and merges with the main branch of the Humboldt River.

The company is a Fortune World's Most Admired Company and is ranked number one in its industry for social responsibility by Fortune magazine. Henry Schein has been recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as the World's Most Ethical Company six times as of 2017.  History  In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York. The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971. In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company. When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO. Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO. Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter. The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq. By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions. In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc as well as Dentrix Dental Systems. Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004. In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States. Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013. Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies. The company's chief executive officer, Stanley Bergman, was announced as Chief Executive Magazine's CEO of the Year in May 2017. In 2018, the FTC accused Benco Dental, Patterson Companies, and Henry Schein of violating antitrust laws. In October 2019, the FTC‚Äôs Chief Administrative Law Judge dismissed the claims against Henry Schein while finding that Benco and Patterson violated U.S. antitrust laws. In February 2019, Henry Schein spun off the company's animal health business and merged it with Vets First Choice to form a new company. The new company is established as Covetrus. Henry Schein Inc. was one of the six main defendants in lawsuits with state and local governments of the opioid epidemic in the United States. The company was dismissed as a defendant in October 2019 in the bellwether Summit County, Ohio litigation.

The lodge is a 3-1/2-story structure built in 1913 based on Kirtland Cutter's design. The foundation and first floor walls are built of stone, with a wood-frame superstructure. The lobby is a large, open space that extends to the third story. It has a massive fireplace and a concrete floor scored in a flagstone pattern, with messages in several Indian languages inscribed into it. The rustic lodge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 as one of the nation's finest examples of large-scale Swiss chalet architecture. Lake McDonald Lodge is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The Lake McDonald Lodge, initially known as the Lewis Glacier Hotel, was the second hotel on the site. The first, the Snyder Hotel, was built by George Snyder in 1895. It was accessed by a steamboat that ran the from the Apgar area to the hotel, preceded by a two- mile trip on a horse-drawn carriage and a ferry trip over the Middle Fork Flathead River. The Lewis Glacier Hotel lodge was built in 1913 by John Lewis, a land speculator from Columbia Falls, Montana. He bought the land, amounting to about , in 1904-5 and had the hotel built during a period when the Great Northern Railway was building other hotels and backcountry chalets, including Many Glacier Hotel, Glacier Park Lodge, Granite Park Chalet, Sperry Chalet, and Two Medicine Store. This movement was part of a trend by railroads during that time to build destination resorts in areas of exceptional scenic value. Railroads wanted to attract tourists and create resorts that were equal to the scenery, and private operators like John Lewis had to build equally impressive facilities in order to keep up. The Lewis hotel, designed by the Spokane firm of Kirtland, Cutter and Malmbren, was a much more ambitious undertaking. The hotel was built in 1913-14, working through the winter months, and opened in June 1914. The new hotel was designed to continue the Swiss cottage theme already developed by the Great Northern railway hotels. Artist Charles M. Russell was a frequent guest at the hotel in the 1920s, and is claimed to have etched pictographs in the dining room's original fireplace hearth. In 1930, the Great Northern Railway acquired the hotel through its subsidiary, the Glacier Park Hotel Company. The hotel's name was changed to Lake McDonald Lodge in 1957. It was damaged in a flash flood in 1964 that destroyed the fireplace and the Russell etchings. The Glacier Park Hotel Company was sold to the Dial Corporation in 1981, then spun off with the Viad company. The lodge was extensively renovated in 1988-89, restoring details that had been obscured over time or damaged by the Snyder Creek 1964 flood. Today, the lodge maintains its historic character. The hotel also includes a number of small cottages located nearby, as well as a motor inn. The main lodge was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Description Present main entry, Lake McDonald Lodge The Lake McDonald Lodge faces the lake, where early visitors arrived. With the construction of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, visitors began to arrive at what had, until then, been the rear of the hotel, which still retains its character as a secondary entrance despite the traffic it receives. Road access arrived by 1921. The main building is 3-1/2 stories high, with a stone foundation and wood framing above. Exposed stone surfaces on the exterior have mostly been covered with white stucco. The upper floors are clad in brown wood clapboards, with sawn fancy trim patterns picked out in white on the upper levels as frieze bands. The white stucco fireplace chimney dominates the present entry elevation, offset around the window above the fireplace. The hotel features a large lobby near the northeastern end which faces southeast, centered on a large stone fireplace set in an inglenook recess on the south wall, surmounted by a large window. The lobby is three stories tall, decorated with skins and taxidermy mounts of native species acquired or trapped by John Lewis, who supplemented the hotel business by trapping, often in the park. There are balconies on the second floor to either side, and on the second and third floors at the rear of the lobby. The building's heavy timber frame is exposed in this area. Stairways to the upper levels feature natural burled log elements. This element is flanked by guest room sections with perpendicular gables on either side. Guest rooms are primarily on the two upper levels. The dining room is to the southwest of the lobby on the main floor in a 1-1/2 story wing, facing the lake, with a 1-1/2 story kitchen wing adjoining. The exterior features balconies on all elevations on the guest room levels and porches on the ground levels. Exposed framing is a mixture of sawn heavy timbers and log framing, often with the bark remaining. Sawn railings with decorative patterns have replaced some of the log railings on the balconies. Log railings remain in the upper levels of the lobby. Parts of the dining room may have been the first component of the present hotel to be built. The dining wing was found to be a compilation of several smaller structures during the 1980s renovations, with an entry on an upper level overlooking the main room. Renovation work adjusted the elevation of the entry drive, which had previously been near the level of the second floor windows, to be only slightly above the ground floor elevation. Many of the original furnishings have remained with the lodge. A number of hickory chairs with log frames are original, as are the piano and a large table and many of the trophies. Other furnishings are reproductions of Old Hickory and Roycroft pieces, while rugs are reproductions of Gustav Stickley originals. The hanging lanterns are reproductions of original work made by Kanai craftsmen for the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Canada, which had been moved to Lake McDonald in the 1960s. In 2013 the lodge acquired a large 4x8 foot mural painting featuring Lake McDonald that had been painted on location in 1962 by Ace Powell. The painting had been commissioned by a couple from Cincinnati, Ohio, who were visiting Glacier Park for the first time. The Lake McDonald Hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987, and is contained within the larger Lake McDonald Lodge Historic District, which had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 22. 1978.

Traditionally, the state of New Hampshire holds the first primary election of the presidential nominating process, and the New Hampshire primary is famous for its strong influence over the selection process of each party's Presidential nominee. Produced during the beginning of the 2004 Presidential election, the film highlights the importance of this one small New England state in determining the eventual nominees, as exemplified by John Kerry's unexpected political comeback against then frontrunner Howard Dean in 2004. His victory in New Hampshire helped to secure his nomination and pitted him against incumbent President George W. Bush. The film covers several topics, including the political youth movement, the media, third party candidates and the voter's decision-making. Known for their fiercely independent political spirit, New Hampshire voters appear throughout the film and present themselves as political aficionados, attuned to every candidate's position on every issue. Filmmakers Aram Fischer, Mark Lynch and Will Rabbe tracked candidates Wesley Clark, Joseph Lieberman, John Edwards, Howard Dean and John Kerry as they campaigned vigorously throughout the state. At times, the film captures comedic moments and at times pokes fun at the carnivalesque nature of the grassroots campaigns. One such moment arises when third-party protest candidate Vermin Supreme arrives wearing flipper shoulder pads and a boot on his head. More discreet tongue-in-cheek humor is evident in the score and the dramatization of otherwise low-key and intimate gatherings. Other appearances include Bill Gardner (the New Hampshire Secretary of State, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Ed Markey, Vanessa Kerry and Martin Sheen.

Plot  When bootleggers Jake Jackson (Walter Percival) and Dan Dickson (Jere Delaney), who have been hiding out in a small upstate New York town, learn that they finally can return to New York City, they try to convince a young kid named Eddie Morgan (Cullen Landis) and his friend, a local barber named Gene (Eugene Palette) to come with them. With a promise from Jackson and Dickson that they will help the young men establish a barbershop in the city, Eddie asks his mother, Mrs. Morgan (Mary Carr), who owns the town's Morgan Hotel, to loan them $5,000 of her savings. Eddie and Gene set up the barbershop in New York City but soon learn that it is merely a front for a speakeasy. Frustrated and yearning for a return to the quiet life, Gene and Eddie vow to go home as soon as they earn enough to pay back Mrs. Morgan. Eddie is in love with Kitty Lewis (top-billed Helene Costello), his hometown sweetheart, who preceded him to New York. Now she is a performer at The Night Hawk, a nightclub owned by Hawk Miller (Wheeler Oakman), notorious bootlegger who controls the speakeasy behind the barbershop. Although Hawk's longtime mistress, Molly Thompson (Gladys Brockwell), warns him not to pursue Kitty, he coldly dismisses her, saying that their relationship is over. After a police officer is killed in a bootlegging raid of a supply of Old Century liquor, Hawk tells his henchmen, Sam (Tom Dugan) and Collins (Tom McGuire), that they must find someone to take the blame to keep the police from closing him down. They suggest that Hawk frame Eddie, thereby \\"killing two birds with one stone.\\" When Eddie comes to the club to visit Kitty, Hawk summons him to his office and asks him to hide his supply of Old Century, saying that it is only temporary, in case the police raid his club. When Detective Crosby (Robert Elliott) comes to the club to question Hawk and implies that he is behind the policeman's murder, Hawk says that the only person he knows who has a supply of Old Century is Eddie. A short time later, Hawk goes to the barbershop and is killed by an unknown assailant. Fearing that they will be blamed, Eddie and Gene put Hawk's body in a barber chair and rub his face with shaving cream just as Crosby arrives at the shop. After Eddie leaves, a nervous Gene pretends to shave Hawk, but the body slides from the chair, revealing its identity to Crosby. Although Gene swears that the absent Eddie is innocent, Crosby deduces that Eddie has gone to Kitty's apartment and follows him there. Crosby is about to arrest Eddie and Kitty, when Molly arrives and reveals that she killed Hawk because he no longer wanted her. As there was a reward for the killer of the policeman, dead or alive, Crosby tells Molly that things will not go badly for her. Now freed from their obligation to Hawk, Kitty and Eddie take the next train home.

However, with studio heads Harry and Jack Warner out of the country to oversee the European premiere of The Jazz Singer, the crew gradually elaborated the plot as the seven-day shooting schedule progressed. Louis Halper, who was in charge of the studio while the Warners were away, eventually wired Jack Warner for the additional money needed to finish the film. Upon discovering that Foy had shot four reels more than promised, Jack Warner ordered him to cut the film back to the original two. Foy later said that the Warners' initial rejection was possibly based on their plans to make the first all-talkie a prestige picture. In an effort to keep the movie off the shelf, Foy screened the picture for an exhibitor friend, who immediately offered to buy it outright for $25,000. Upon hearing this, the Warners asked Albert Warner to view the film, and his praise of Lights convinced Jack and Harry that their decision was premature, securing the film's release.  Reception  Contemporary critical reception of Lights of New York was decidedly cool. A New York Times review, while acknowledging the film's place as \\"the alpha of what may develop as the new language of the screen\\", called the plot \\"crude in the extreme\\" and the direction wooden, only singling out the musical interludes for praise. \\"Ordinary cast and production\\", reported Film Daily. \\"Discard the talking element, and it is just a second-rate meller.\\" Variety was even more harsh in its dismissal, labeling the production \\"hokumed junk.\\" \\"In a year from now everyone concerned [...] will run for the river before looking at it again.\\" Oliver Claxton of The New Yorker also panned the film. \\"It would have been better silent, and much better unseen. The talking films have not even progressed to their infancy yet. Bad as it is, though, the film shows what I have been very reluctant to believe, that audibility will be a great help to the movies.\\" = Box office = The criticism did not keep audiences away, although demand may have been driven more by the novelty of the first \\"all-talking\\" feature film than the film's dramatic qualities. A preview engagement in Pasadena, California, resulted in lines around the block, and the first week's gross at New York City's Mark Strand Theater amounted to $47,000. Upon nationwide release, the film grossed $1.2 million, making the film a box-office success. According to Warner Bros records the film had domestic rentals of $1,160,000 and foreign rentals of $92,000.  Preservation status  The film and the Vitaphone soundtrack still survive in complete form. In a formal ceremony on July 24, 1946, Albert Warner presented a print of Lights of New York to the Library of Congress as part of a yearlong celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the premiere of the Warner Bros. studio's first sound features.

It plays music from the 1960s. Airing on XM since 2001, the channel became available to Sirius subscribers replacing '60s Vibrations on November 12, 2008, following the merger of the two companies. The station currently broadcasts on channel 6 of both services, as well as on Dish Network channel 6006. Like the other decades channels, The '60s on 6 works to recreate the feel of 1960s radio. They use similar DJs, classic PAMS jingles, period slang, and news updates. The channel was also used for XM's annual rock and roll hits music chronology, IT. The logo features a Peace sign for the zero in its logo. As of 2008, The '60s on 6 was the fifth most listened to station on the XM service, with a cume of 581,300 listeners per week, according to Arbitron analysis. Post Sirius XM merger With the merger of many Sirius XM channels on November 12, 2008, there were some changes to 60s on 6. The channel's playlist, which had once exceeded 3,000 songs was sliced to emphasize Top 10 hits more, with most of the lower- charting tracks as well as many of the crossover and novelty hits of the era removed and abandoned from the rotation. Pat Clarke, who helmed the channel since the 2004 departure of Program Director and channel creator, Cleveland Wheeler, was dismissed along with another disk jockey, Marty \\"with the Party\\" Thompson. Phlash Phelps and Terry \\"Motormouth\\" Young were spared, and \\"Broadway\\" Bill Lee and Mike Kelly joined the airstaff. Lee eventually moved to the '70s on 7 channel. Cousin Brucie began a live Saturday all-request show. Wolfman Jack was moved into an early afternoon block, and was eventually eliminated altogether, along with other channel fixtures such as the Sonic Sound Salute, Sweet Sixteen Music Machine countdown, and Chickenman. The classic PAMS jingles were edited to remove references to XM Radio, or jingles not referencing XM were used. In the summer of 2009, PAMS produced a new set of jingles based on its Series 31, \\"Music Explosion\\" for the channel. Prior to the merger, it was the only XM channel to not change its zero in the logo, since it has always been a peace sign. All decades channels changed logos, whereas this channel, along with the '40s on 4 and the '70s on 7 are updated logos from their predecessors. The current logo for The '60s on 6 is the same, but \\"The\\" is phased out on the left, and adds the \\"on 6\\" info at the right.

This arrangement was presented in the ≈åmiya Palace. is a form of ikebana.  History  The origins go back to Buddhist offerings of flowers, which are placed upright in vases. This tatehana (Á´ã„Å¶Ëä±) style was established in the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1568). The term came to be a popular synonym for ikebana in the 15th century, when rikka became a distinctive element of interior decoration in the reception rooms at the residences of the military leaders, nobility, and priests of the time.Genshoku Chado Daijiten, ed. Iguchi Kaisen et. al. (Kyoto: Tankosha Publishing Co., 10th printing, 1975) (in Japanese). Entry for Kad≈ç. It enjoyed a revival in the 17th century, and was used as a decorative technique for ceremonial and festive occasions. One of the rikka proponents was Senkei Ikenob≈ç (Ê±†ÂùäÂ∞ÇÊÖ∂). The essence of the direction of the rite was clarified by Sen'≈ç Ikenob≈ç (Ê±†ÂùäÂ∞Ç‰ºù, 1482‚Äì1543) in the manuscript \\"Ikenob≈ç Sen'≈ç kuden\\" (Ê±†ÂùäÂ∞ÇÂøúÂè£‰ºù). Today it is still practice by the Ikenob≈ç school of flower arranging. Rikka later deveoped into a less formal style. It was eventually supplanted by the sh≈çka style, which had a classical appearance but was asymmetrical in structure. The Saga Go-ry≈´ (ÂµØÂ≥®Âæ°ÊµÅ) school has Buddhist roots and the style of floral offerings at the altar follows similar rules and is called sh≈çgonka (ËçòÂé≥ËèØ).https://helsinkisagaikebana.org/about-arrangement- styles/http://www.ikebana- bundesverband.de/files/index.php?menu=en&page;=saga.html  Characteristics  The rikka style reflects the magnificence of nature and its display. For example, pine branches symbolize endurance and eternity, and yellow chrysanthemums symbolizes life. Trees can symbolise mountains, while grasses and flowers can suggest water. Until 1700, the arrangement consisted of seven main lines, and roughly starting in 1800, it consisted of nine main lines, each of which supports other minor lines. Important rules have been created that relate to the nature of the lines, their lengths and combinations of materials, the use of kenzan or komiwara (straw bundles), etc. Editing in that style can only be done through regular and long-term practice. The main axis, often the branch, is predominantly perpendicular, often the axis is formed by pine branches and is the most distinctive element of the arrangement. Both other lines are arranged at the bottom. The editing centre is filled like a bouquet of flowers. Rikka style arrangements were also used for festive events and exhibitions. They are usually quite large from 1.5‚Äì4.5 metres and their construction requires the highest technical and artistic skills. Rikka sh≈çf≈´tai (Á´ãËä±Ê≠£È¢®‰Ωì) builds on the basics of traditional aesthetics of rikka direction. It is used by seven or nine lines when creating a pattern. The arrangement is to be varied and expresses the diversity of nature, which is very characteristic for this direction. Rikka shimp≈´tai (Á´ãËä±Êñ∞È¢®‰Ωì) was introduced in 1999. The characteristics lies in the arrangement of lines that create nine to eleven branches or stems and the essence lies above all in balance, harmony, perspective and movement, although it follows the rikka style. It is not important to follow the rule of only three plant materials. Exotic plant material is used as well as classical plants (saliva, pine).

Francesco Feo (1691 ‚Äì 28 January 1761) was an Italian composer, known chiefly for his operas. He was born and died in Naples, where most of his operas were premi√®red. Life Feo studied music at the Conservatorio di Santa Maria della Piet√† in Naples, starting on 3 September 1704. Among the other composers he met there were Leonardo Leo, Giuseppe de Majo (who would later marry his niece), and Niccol√≤ Jommelli. His first teacher was Andrea Basso, and after 1705 Nicola Fago, who had only just been appointed. Feo remained at the conservatory until some time around 1712. In 1713 he presented his first opera, L‚Äôamor tirannico, ossia Zenobia (Tyrannical Love, or Zenobia), and for carnival 1714 Il martirio di Santa Caterina (The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Egypt), an oratorio. His fame began to increase with sacred works for local churches, such as his Missa defunctorum (Requiem Mass) in 1718, and with his recitatives, arias and comic scenes for performances of operas by other composers when they were staged in Naples. In 1719 Feo wrote La forza della virt√π (The Power of Virtue), and then his opera seria Teuzzone in 1720. Real fame only came with his opera seria Siface, re di Numidia (Syphax, King of Numidia), for the Teatro San Bartolomeo in 1723. The libretto was the first attempt at dramma per musica by the 25-year-old Pietro Metastasio, who had just arrived in Naples. With his increasing popularity, Feo was appointed as a teacher in the Conservatorio di Sant'Onofrio a Porta Capuana, where he worked alongside Gabriele Prota and took over from Nicola Grillo. In the next sixteen years he became known as one of the most important teachers in Naples. Among his students at Sant'Onofrio were Nicola Sabatino, Nicol√≤ Jommelli, Matteo Capranica, and Gennaro Manna. In 1739 he left Sant'Onofrio to teach at the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Ges√π Cristo, to replace Francesco Durante who had just retired. Feo would stay there until 1743, helped by Alfonso Caggi and later Girolamo Abos. During his time there, he taught Giacomo Insanguine and Gian Francesco de Majo. Feo wrote most of his oratorios between 1723 and 1743, along with a good portion of his cantatas and much other sacred music. His best-known oratorio was San Francesco Salesio, Apostolo del Chablais (Saint Francis de Sales, the Apostle of Chablais, 1734), which would be performed many times in the next twenty years or so throughout Italy. For Rome and Turin he wrote another six opere serie and several intermezzi. Just as his friend Giovanni Battista Pergolesi was commissioned in 1734-35 by the Cavalieri della Vergine dei Dolori to write a new Stabat Mater to replace the now unfashionable one written by Alessandro Scarlatti, so Feo was commissioned to replace Scarlatti's St. John Passion. Feo composed the serenate Oreste and Polinice for Madrid in 1738, and for the Fathers of the Holy Cross in Prague he wrote the oratorio La distruzione dell‚Äôesercito dei Cananei con la morte di Sisara (The Destruction of the Canaanite Army and the Death of Sisara, 1739). His last opera, Arsace, was performed in Turin for the reopening of the Teatro Regio in 1740. His last oratorio, Ruth, was performed at Rome in 1743. In 1743, the Poveri di Ges√π Cristo was abolished and converted into a seminary. Feo retired from teaching, but continued to compose sacred music for Neapolitan churches, including the Santissima Annunziata Maggiore, where he became maestro di cappella in 1726. His last autograph composition is a Quoniam tu solus sanctus (For Thou alone art holy), 1760, for tenor and strings.
