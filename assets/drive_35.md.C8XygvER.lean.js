Santa Cruz, and subsequently a math teacher at Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, New York City for many years. This strongly worded opinion piece is organized into two parts. The first part, \\"Lamentation\\", criticizes the way mathematics is typically taught in American schools and argues for an aesthetic, intuitive, and problem-oriented approach to teaching. The second part, \\"Exultation\\", gives specific examples of how to teach mathematics as an art. Background This book was developed from a 25-page essay that was written in 2002, originally circulated in typewritten manuscript copies, and subsequently published by Keith Devlin on his online column for the Mathematical Association of America's webzine MAA Online.Devlin, Keith (2009). Foreword, p. 9 of Quote \\"The first thing to understand is that mathematics is an art. The difference between math and the other arts, such as music and painting, is that our culture does not recognize it as such.\\" [p. 22] References Further reading * Paul Lockhart, Measurement (Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012). *------.

The European part of Russia is included in Eastern Europe. Russia is home to the most inscribed sites with 8 sites, two of which are transborder properties shared with Mongolia in Eastern Asia. The first site from the region was the Itchan Kala in Uzbekistan inscribed in 1990. Each year, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on ten criteria: six for cultural heritage (i‚Äìvi) and four for natural heritage (vii‚Äìx). Some sites, designated \\"mixed sites,\\" represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Northern and Central Asia, there are 11 cultural, 8 natural, and no mixed sites. All of the Russian sites (7) are natural and with the exception of Sayarka, all of the sites in Central Asia are cultural. The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is endangered, citing \\"conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List.\\" None of the sites in this region has ever been listed as endangered, but possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of cases.

A private museum is a collection, usually on a very limited topic and operated by individual enthusiasts, collectors, clubs or companies. Overview Unlike a public or governmental museum, a scientific monitoring and systematic documentation is not always guaranteed. Therefore, a private museum has relevance for historical research only if it complements the national collections. Under certain circumstances, a private museum also receives funding from the state, so that a comparison with public museums is possible. Many, especially smaller, private museums do not meet the requirements of the International Council of Museums (ICOM). The main reason is that qualified personnel are not sufficiently available or can hardly be financed and therefore often only very limited opening times may be offered. Often private museums focus on entertainment and have a tourism focus. Their collections are on display for the public to enjoy. References External links * Private Museums, Local Collections.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The house was built for a wealthy merchant. It was probably built in 1603. Above the door is a plaque inscribed with the date 1503, but this is an error because the building has been dated to the early 17th century by dendrochronology. It was extended to the rear in the middle of the 17th century, and in 1728 it was rebuilt, enclosing the portion of the Row passing through its first floor. At street level are two undercrofts. In the past one undercroft was in use as a bakehouse, while the other formed part of the Britannia Inn. The building has subsequently been used as a caf√© on the ground floor, with an apartment above it. The timber framing on the south side of the building was reconstructed in 1973‚Äì74. Architecture Tudor House is constructed in sandstone, in brick, and in timber framing with plaster panels, and is roofed in slate. It has four storeys plus a cellar. The lower two storeys are in brick, with timber-framing above. The entrance door at street level is in a doorway with a Tudor arch, and on each side of it is a two-pane window. Above the windows are headboards inscribed \\"TUDOR\\" and \\"HOUSE\\". The first floor contains three casement windows. The two top storeys are both jettied and timber-framed. The third storey contains two three-light mullioned and transomed casement windows, with panels containing S-shaped braces on their outer sides. The top storey has one three-light mullioned window over four arched panels. To the side of it are panels containing S-shaped braces, and above it is a gable with lozenge- and S-shaped braces.

History  Weather reconnaissance units were assigned to two different units numbered nine, the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Group and the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Wing The group was first activated as the 9th Weather Group in 1953 at Andrews Air Force Base, and was responsible for providing weather observation and forecasting services for units of Air Research and Development Command. In 1957, the group moved to Scott Air Force Base, Illinois and provided similar services for units of Military Air Transport Service. In July 1961, the group moved to McClellan Air Force Base, California, where it was redesignated 9th Weather Reconnaissance Group and assumed responsibilities for Air Weather Service's worldwide reconnaissance mission. On 8 July 1965 the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Wing was activated at McClellan Air Force Base, California and assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Group. Supported units flying into tropical storms and typhoons in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Supported unit deployments overseas and space launches from Florida by supporting units flying along routes to provide weather data since.

History The biggest concentration of Sahrawi refugees was created in 1975‚Äì76, when Sahrawi refugees were fleeing from Moroccan forces, who advanced through Western Sahara during the Western Sahara War between Morocco and Sahrawi Polisario Front. Those refugees ended up in Sahrawi refugee camps in the Tindouf Province, Algeria. With most refugees still living in the camps, the refugee situation is among the most protracted ones worldwide. Thousands of ethnic Sahrawi refugees from Western Sahara also fled to Mauritania to escape the war, which began when Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1976. Uncertainty about the political future of Western Sahara deterred the ethnic Sahrawi refugees from returning home. Since the creation of the Sahrawi refugee problem in the 1970s, a significant number of Sahrawi refugees have tried to upgrade their status, by leaving the refugee camps in Tindouf and the northern villages in Mauritania. Some chose to immigrate to Europe, as part of the general migration wave from Africa, while others dispersed in Mauritania. Demographics =Algeria= The number of Sahrawi refugees in Tinduf camps is disputed and politically sensitive. Morocco argues that Polisario and Algeria overestimate the numbers to attract political attention and foreign aid, while Polisario accuses Morocco of attempting to restrict human aid as a means of pressure on civilian refugee populations. The refugees' numbers will also be important in determining their political weight in the possible event of a referendum to determine Western Sahara's future status. Algerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000. This has been supported by Polisario, although the movement recognizes that some refugees have rebased to Mauritania, a country that houses about 26,000 Sahrawis refugees. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) referred to Algeria's figure for many years, but in 2005 concern about it being inflated led the organization to reduce its working figure to 90,000 based on satellite imagery analysis. UNHCR is in dialogue with the Algerian Government and the Sahrawi refugee leadership, seeking to conduct a census to determine the exact number of refugees in the camps. In 1998, UN's Minurso mission identified 42,378 voting-age adults in the camps, counting only those who had contacted the mission's registration offices and subsequently been able to prove their descent from pre-1975 Western Sahara. No attempt was made to estimate the total population number in the camps. The Moroccan government contends that the total number of refugees is around 45,000 to 50,000, and also that these people are kept in the camps by Polisario against their will. The exact number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria is unknown however there have been may estimates. The UNHCR \\"vulnerable refugees\\" in 2005 estimated 90,000. The UNHCR estimated 155,000 prior to 2005. 90,000 estimated by the CIA world Factbook. 165,000 claimed by the Polisario and Algerian government. 45,000‚Äì50,000 claimed by the Moroccan government. 25,000‚Äì40,000 claimed by the Dissident former Polisario officials. =Mauritania= The UNHCR and other humanitarian assistance agencies had virtually no contact with those refugees. Most lived in the northern town of Zou√©rat and the coastal town of Nouadhibou on Mauritania's northern border. By the end of 2003, there were more than 26,000 registered Sahrawi refugees in Mauritania. They formed a majority of people with refugee status in the whole Mauritania. =Western Sahara= The Sahrawis who did not flee have been given Moroccan citizenship. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants. =In Europe= Humanitarian aid The ECHO (European Commission ‚Äì Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection) allocated in 2013 some 10 million Euro for the purposes of improving living conditions of Sahrawi refugees. ECHO has so far donated nearly 200 million Euro for that purpose, beginning from 1993. The European Commission refers to the Sahrawi refugees as the \\"forgotten refugees\\".

G. Grace increased his involvement with the United South of England Eleven (USEE) in order to provide more income for his mother, with whom he and his younger brother Fred were still living. Grace continued to play regularly for Gloucestershire and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and, when required, by the Gentlemen. In the late summer of 1872, he toured North America with a team of players who all had amateur status. In the 1873 season, he performed his first season \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Background Following the death of their father, Grace and his brother Fred still lived with their mother at Downend. Their father had left just enough to maintain the family home but the onus was now on the brothers to increase their earnings from cricket to pay for their medical studies (Fred started his in the autumn of 1872). They achieved this through their involvement as match organisers of the United South of England Eleven (USEE) which played six matches in the 1872 season including games in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Grace's first visit to Scotland.Rae, pp.102‚Äì105. 1872 was a wet summer and Grace ended his season in early August so that he could join the tour of North America.Rae, p.105. He made 22 first-class appearances, scoring 1,561 runs at 53.82 including 6 centuries with a highest score of 170 not out and taking 27 catches. He took 62 wickets at 11.87 including 9 instances of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 8‚Äì33, and 3 instances of 10 wickets in a match.Rae, p.495. He topped the batting averages ahead of John Selby, E.M. Grace, Richard Daft, William Yardley and A.N. Hornby. His nearest challengers among runscorers were Richard Humphrey, Jupp and Lockwood. Grace's 62 wickets placed him 5th in that list, once again well behind the leader Southerton who took 169. James Lillywhite and the two Shaws were also ahead of Grace and just behind him were Emmett and Street. The best average was William McIntyre's 5.65. Gloucestershire played seven inter-county matches and had mixed success. Although they defeated both Surrey and Yorkshire by an innings, they lost another match against Surrey and had three draws including two against Nottinghamshire. Medium pacer Thomas Lang, who played for the county till 1875, made his debut. Grace made three overseas tours during his career. The first was to the United States and Canada with R.A. Fitzgerald's team in August and September 1872.Midwinter, p.45. The expenses of this tour were paid by the Montreal Club who had written to Fitzgerald the previous winter and invited him to form a team. Grace and his all-amateur colleagues made \\"short work of the weak teams\\" they faced.Birley, p.122. The team included two other future England captains in Hornby, who became a rival of Grace in future years; and the Honourable George Harris, the future Lord Harris, who became a very close friend and a most useful ally. The team met in Liverpool on 8 August and sailed on the SS Sarmatian, docking at Quebec on 17 August. Simon Rae recounts that the bond between Grace and Harris was forged by their mutual sea-sickness. Matches were played in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, London, New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. The team sailed back from Quebec on 27 September and arrived at Liverpool on 8 October.Rae, pp.110‚Äì129. The tour was \\"a high point of (Grace's) early years\\" and he \\"retained fond memories of it\\" for the rest of his life, calling it \\"a prolonged and happy picnic\\" in his ghost-written Reminiscences.Rae, p.110. Grace became the first batsman to score a century before lunch in a first- class match when he made 134 for Gentlemen of the South versus Players of the South at The Oval in 1873.Bowen, p.284. In the same season, he became the first player ever to complete the \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season. He went on to do that eight times in all:Webber, Playfair, pp.181‚Äì182. * 1873 ‚Äì 2,139 runs and 106 wickets * 1874 ‚Äì 1,664 runs and 140 wickets * 1875 ‚Äì 1,498 runs and 191 wickets * 1876 ‚Äì 2,622 runs and 129 wickets * 1877 ‚Äì 1,474 runs and 179 wickets * 1878 ‚Äì 1,151 runs and 152 wickets * 1885 ‚Äì 1,688 runs and 117 wickets * 1886 ‚Äì 1,846 runs and 122 wickets Grace made 20 first- class appearances in 1873, scoring 2,139 runs at 71.30 including 7 centuries with a highest score of 192 not out and taking 29 catches. He took 106 wickets at 12.92 including 10 instances of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 10‚Äì92, and 3 instances of 10 wickets in a match. No other batsman came near his runs or average, the best of the rest being Jupp, Fred Grace, William Oscroft and Isaac Walker. Grace's 106 wickets was 4th best behind Southerton, Alfred Shaw and James Lillywhite with Allen Hill in fifth place. William McIntyre again had the best average with 8.38. 1873 was the year that some semblance of organisation was brought into county cricket with the introduction of a residence qualification. This was aimed principally at England's outstanding bowler James Southerton who had been playing for both Surrey and Sussex, having been born in one and living in the other. Southerton chose to play for his county of residence, Surrey, from then on but remained the country's top bowler. The counties agreed on residence but not on a means of deciding a championship and so the title remained an unofficial award until 1889. Gloucestershire had a very strong claim to this unofficial title in 1873 but consensus was that they shared it with Nottinghamshire. These two did not play each other and both were unbeaten in six matches, but Nottinghamshire won five and Gloucestershire won four.Webber, County Championship, pp.12‚Äì18.

Those subparts are Subpart 2, Section 5241: Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Programs and Subpart 14, Section 5541: Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems and Section 5542: Promotion of School Readiness through Early Childhood Emotional and Social Development. = Subpart 2, Section 5241: Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Programs = This section authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to local education agencies (LEA) for the purposes of establishing or expanding counseling services for students in both elementary and secondary school settings. This section also delineates the conditions under which LEAs should be given special consideration by the Secretary of Education. Those conditions are: # Demonstration of great need (determined in part by student to counselor, student to social worker and student to school psychologist ratios). # Proposal of especially innovative or promising programs. # Demonstration of great possibility for replication and dissemination. This section also requires that the counseling services for which funds are provided follow certain guidelines. Those guidelines include requirements such as assurances that funds will be spent on programs that will be comprehensive in their approach, serve the needs of all students, increase the availability of services, employ qualified professionals, involve families and communities, evaluate the outcomes of the programs and show an innovative approach to providing services. The section also requires that the office of the Secretary of Education must make a report evaluating the programs that receive funds under the section. = Subpart 14, Section 5541: Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems = This section gives the Secretary of Education authority to award grants to and enter into contracts with a Local Education Agency, State Education Agency and Indian tribe to support programs that expand student access to mental health care through the creation of innovative links between schools and the community mental system. These grants are awarded based on an application process. The section limits these grants to a five-year period and requires that the funds be used by LEAs, SEAs and Indian tribes to expand or improve care for students as well as to provide training for school based and community based professionals (both educators and mental health service providers), consultation and technical assistance for schools and agencies, coordination of services that will fit students' language and cultural background, and evaluation of the programs for which grant money is provided. = Section 5542: Promotion of School Readiness through Early Childhood Emotional and Social Development = This section gives the Secretary of Education the authority to make Foundations for Learning Grants to LEAs and other local, community-based organizations (such as councils or non profits) whose mission is to assist students in preparation for school. These grants are application based and required to be directed toward programs that help students to develop emotionally, socially and behaviorally; programs that help to coordinate families working with community-based programs that provide such services; programs that provide other services that support such community-based programs such as transportation services; programs that evaluate the success of such programs, or to provide funding for students to participate in or be evaluated for eligibility for such programs. Other requirements for these grants include that programs must not also be receiving funds from other sources and that the office of the Secretary of Education must evaluate or contract for an outside evaluation for each program that receives a grant.  Context for the Provisions  In an article about the connections between school mental health services and No Child Left Behind from November 2006, Brian P. Daly et al. cited a National Institute of Mental Health study that found that between 5% and 9% of students face emotional and behavioral issues that impede their learning. Beyond this, a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on the interaction between school policies and health for adolescents noted in 2008 that some twenty percent of students annually demonstrate evidence of experiencing a mental health issue. Additionally, the Department of Education, in its application materials for its program of Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems, notes that the majority of mental, emotional and behavior disorders have their foundation in childhood or adolescence. They report that more than half of adults who have experienced a mental, emotional or behavioral disorder claim that it began during those early years and that by the age of sixteen nearly forty percent of children and young adults have experienced a psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, the Department of Education reports that mental health concerns overlap with and in many cases undergird other important themes in education today, such as bullying. In their Introduction, the Department of Education cites one study that showed that both perpetrators and victims of incidences of bullying were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression than other students. In its report on the interaction of school policy and health issues for adolescents, the CDC notes that the state of mental health systems treatment in schools or coordinated by schools is much more extensive today than it once was. It notes that while in the past such services had been given to students in Special Education, one report by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found through surveys that virtually all schools surveyed had at least one professional on staff to provide mental health services and that upwards of eighty percent of the schools surveyed provided mental health and related behavioral and crisis intervention assessments. Additionally, the American Counseling Association (ACA) reports that while in 1998 the ratio of students to counselors in schools was 561 to 1, but that by 2008-9 that ratio had lessened to 457:1. Despite this progress, the system is still seen as inadequate in many ways by major evaluations of the mental health system. In 2002, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health evaluated the current system of mental health in the United States. The commission concluded that there were \\"unmet needs and that many barriers impede care for people with mental illnesses.\\" Furthermore, in an article regarding the role of schools in mental health services, Sharon Hoover Stephan et al. report that the number of people who seek treatment for mental health disorders is fewer than 30%. Finally, despite improvement in the rations of students to counselors in schools, the 2008-9 ratio of 457:1 still greatly exceeds the ration recommended by the ACA, which is 250:1 References Category:United States federal education legislation ","title":"Mental health provisions in Title V of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001"},{"id":"33594270","text":"Pat Thomas (born 1959 in California) is an author, journalist and campaigner specialising in the field of environment and health.

She became a brand ambassador for Waterford Crystal and Donegal Carpets in the United States, and was instrumental in encouraging the visit of president John F. Kennedy to Ireland in June 1963. Dot also became a writer and a radio and TV commentator, and was a well-known celebrity in 1960s Ireland.

The route ran from the Comanche summer hunting grounds to the Rio Grande, where the Spanish had established a line of missions and presidios during the eighteenth century in what was then called New Spain, which the Comanche would raid. Although called a \\"trail,\\" the Comanche Trail was actually a network of parallel and branching trails, always following sources of good water. By 1857 parts of the trail had been named and appeared on maps. Following water sources, the primary trail ran north from two starting points on the Rio Grande River, one at Boquillas and the other at Presidio, with crossings of the river at both locations. The legs of the trail met at Comanche Springs, near Fort Stockton, Texas and Las Moras Springs near Fort Clark. The trail continued north to cross the Pecos River in the vicinity of Horsehead Crossing, bending northeast to the area of Odessa and Big Spring, Texas. From there the Comanche Trail ran east past the Caprock Escarpment and on across the Llano Estacado by two separate routes. One branch ran to the vicinity of Lubbock and along the Double Mountains (Texas) fork of the Brazos River to near the present site of Abernathy, to near Littlefield, then via a series of springs to the Pecos River near Fort Sumner. A separate fork ran from Big Spring, Texas to near Plainview, Texas, rejoining the other route to the east of Muleshoe. Northern branches of the trail ran through the Texas Panhandle into Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas. Southern branches extended into northern Mexico through Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango to Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi, while an eastern fork ran from Big Spring, Texas southeast to Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. The Comanche Trail was noted as a beaten path as much as a mile wide. Much of the southeastern leg of the main trail runs through what is now Big Bend National Park, leaving the park through Persimmon Gap in the Santiago Mountains in the northern portion of the park. U.S. 385 follows the same route through parts of the park.

Origin of the name  The name of the hill comprises two parts: Kollwess and h√∂h. The first stems from the fact that the land on which the hill lies used to belong to the Kohlwes family in Wehdem. The second part is related to H√∂he, the German word for \\"height\\".

History =Early history= First mentioned in 1345, by the end of the century Borreby had come into the possession of the Urne family, an important house of high nobility in Denmark at that time. In 1410 the estate was acquired by Bishop Peder Jensen Lodehat and it was then held by the Bishops of Roskilde until its confiscation by the Crown in 1536 in connection with the Reformation in 1534. =Friis era: The current building= Johan Friis In 1553, possibly somewhat earlier, King Frederick II ceded the property to Chancellor Johan Friis, one of the most powerful men in the country at the time, who also owned Hesselagerg√•rd on the island of Funen. In 1456 he built the current castle at a site north of the old building. After Johan Friis' death in 1570, Borreby was passed to his nephew, Christian Friis, who later followed in his uncle's footsteps as Chancellor from 1594 to 1616. Christian Friis expanded the complex with an extra moat and several new buildings, including two castle yard wings to the east and west, a gatehouse and several large farm buildings west of the castle. The estate remained in the possession of the Friis family until the brothers Oluf and Valdemar Daa ran it into economic ruin during their ownership from 1652 to 1681. =Castenschiold era: Hans Christian Andersen connection= Borreby Castle in 1870 In 1783, Borreby was acquired by Major General Joachim Castenschiold. Together with nearby Holsteinborg and Basn√¶s, Borreby later in the century formed a small cluster of manor houses where Hans Christian Andersen was a frequent guest. In 1859 Andersen published his story \\"The Wind Tells about Valdemar Daae and His Daughters\\", a tragic tale of how the last descendant of Johan Friss to own Borreby lost the estate through his own foolish and quite unsuccessful experiments with alchemy. The Castenschiold family still own the property. Architecture Main building Built in red brick in the Renaissance style, Borreby consists of two and a half floors resting on stone plinth and topped by a pitched roof. There are four towers, three on the north side and a staircase tower on the south side. The masonry is decorated with arched friezes above each storey and the windows are topped by depressed arches. The defensive character of the building is witnessed by machicolation holes which are found on all sides. Behind these there used to be a walkway which has now been removed, but machicolation holes can still be seen all round the building. The gatehouse from 1600 The interior is dominated by Joachim Lorentz Holten Castenschiold's modernizations carried out in the 1750s and restorations from 1883 to 1884 and 1923‚Äì24. The east and west wings of the outer courtyard date from Christian Friis' expansion, as does the gatehouse from 1600 and the large farm buildings located west of the castle. A chapel in the west wing was in its current form designed in 1754. In the 21st century Borreby Castle is owned by and managed as a modern agricultural estate with a large production of biomass for power stations on Zealand. There is public access free of charge to the outer courtyard and park with views of the historical buildings. The castle is also open for tours on prior notification. It is also used as a cultural venue. Borreby Art Gallery is based in the former courthouse as well as some former stables. Borreby Theatre with a capacity of 450 spectators is currently under construction in a former barn, and other buildings will house a restaurant and caf√©.

Belief in toilet gods ‚Äì a type of household deity ‚Äì has been known from both modern and ancient cultures, ranging from Japan to ancient Rome. Such deities have been associated with health, well-being and fertility (because of the association between human waste and agriculture) and have been propitiated in a wide variety of ways, including making offerings, invoking and appeasing them through prayers, meditating and carrying out ritual actions such as clearing one's throat before entering or even biting the latrine to transfer spiritual forces back to the god. Modern cultures In Japan, belief in the toilet god or kawaya kami served a dual purpose. Most bodily wastes were collected and used as fertilizers, ensuring a higher overall level of sanitation than in other countries where wastes were stored in cesspits or otherwise disposed of. Toilets were often dark and unpleasant places where the user was at some risk of falling in and drowning. The protection of the toilet god was therefore sought to avoid such an unsanitary fate. The god also had a role to play in promoting fertility, as human waste was collected and used as fertiliser. Rituals were performed at the New Year to ask the kawaya kami for help in producing a good harvest. In some places, family members would sit on a straw mat in front of the toilet and eat a mouthful of rice, symbolising eating something that the god had left. A properly appointed toilet would be decorated and kept as clean as possible, as the toilet god was considered to be very beautiful. The state of the toilet was said to have an effect on the physical appearance of unborn children. Pregnant women asked the toilet god to give boys a \\"high nose\\" and dimples to girls. If the toilet was dirty, however, it was said to cause children to be born ugly and unhappy. According to a different Japanese tradition, the toilet god was said to be a blind man holding a spear in his hand. This presented an obvious and painful threat when squatting down to defecate, so it was regarded as necessary to clear one's throat before entering so that the blind toilet god would sheathe his spear. Various rituals and names were associated with the latrine god in different parts of Japan. On Ishigaki Island it was called kamu-taka and was propitiated by the sick with sticks of incense, flowers, rice and rice wine. In Nagano Prefecture's former Minamiazumi District, sufferers from toothache offered lights to the toilet god, which was called takagamisama. The inhabitants of Hiroshima called the toilet god Setchinsan while those of ≈åita Prefecture called it Sechinbisan and those of Ehime Prefecture called it Usshimasama. The American anthropologist John Embree recorded in the 1930s that the inhabitants of part of the southernmost Japanese island of Ky≈´sh≈´ would put a branch of willow or Chinese nettle tree, decorated with pieces of mochi (rice cake), into the toilet as an offering to ask the toilet god to protect the house's inhabitants from bladder problems in the coming year. The Ainu people of far northern Japan and the Russian Far East believed that the Rukar Kamuy, their version of a toilet god, would be the first to come to help in the event of danger. In the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa Islands), the fuuru nu kami, or \\"toilet god\\", is the family protector of the area of waste. The pig toilet („Åµ„Éº„Çã / È¢®ÂëÇ), lacking this benevolent god, could become a place of evil influence and potential haunting (such as by an akaname,Aka-name ~ Âû¢Ëàê („ÅÇ„Åã„Å™„ÇÅ) ~ part of The Obakemono Project: An Online Encyclopedia of Y≈çkai and Bakemono or other negative spirits, welcomed by the accumulation of waste matter, rejected and abandoned by the human body). Because he is considered a primary household god, the fuuru nu kami's habitat (the bathroom) is kept clean and is perceived to warrant deferential behavior. Reports on the family's status are delivered regularly to the fuuru nu kami. He shares traits with the Korean bathroom goddess Cheukshin. Similarly in Korea, the toilet god or Cheukshin (or cheukgansin) was known as the \\"young lady of the toilet\\". She was regarded as having a \\"perverse character\\" and was propitiated each year in October by housewives, along with the other household gods. A rather different form of toilet god existed in China, in the shape of Zi Gu Á¥´Âßë, also known as Mao Gu, the Lady of the Latrine or the Third Daughter of the Latrine. She was believed to be the spirit of a concubine who had been physically abused by a vengeful wife and had died in the latrine. Her cult appears to have originated in the Shanxi region and spread across China by the Tang period. Women worshipped her in the form of a home-made doll on the fifteenth day of each year's first month, when she was ritually summoned in the latrine during the night. Prayers were said to the doll, telling her that the husband and wife had gone and that she could now safely come out. The motions of the doll ‚Äì sometimes manifested as automatic writing ‚Äì were used for fortune telling by the worshippers. Another interpretation came from a popular novel of the Ming period, which portrayed the latrine deity as three sisters who were responsible for the Primeval Golden Dipper (hunyuan jindou) or celestial toilet bowl, from which all beings were born. Some variants of Buddhism incorporate a belief in Ucchu·π£ma, the \\"god of the latrine\\", who is said to destroy defilement. A cult developed around Ucchu·π£ma in Zen monasteries where the latrine, the bath and the meditation hall or refectory were regarded as the three \\"silent places\\" (sanmokud≈ç) for contemplation. In New Zealand, the atua ‚Äì the gods and spirits of the MƒÅori people ‚Äì were believed to focus on the village latrine. If a warrior experienced sickness or faintness of heart or carried out an activity regarded as tapu, he would retreat to the latrine and bite its structure. The gods were said to frequent the latrine in large numbers and excrement was regarded as the food of the dead. Biting the latrine was said to transfer the tapu quality that the biter had acquired back to its origins in the world of the gods. The practice of biting to transfer mana or tapu was seen in other areas of MƒÅori life, such as a son biting his dead father's penis to acquire his powers, or a student weaver biting part of the loom to acquire tapu to assist with learning how to weave cloth.Hanson & Hanson (1983), ibid, p. 81 Ancient cultures The Shrine to Venus Cloacina in the Roman Forum The inhabitants of ancient Rome had a sewer goddess, a toilet god and a god of excrement. The sewer goddess Cloacina (named from the Latin word cloaca or sewer) was borrowed from Etruscan mythology and became seen as the protectoress of the Cloaca Maxima, Rome's sewage system. An early Roman ruler, Titus Tatius, built a shrine to her in his toilet; she was invoked if sewers became blocked or backed up. She was later merged with the better-known Roman goddess Venus and was worshipped at the Shrine of Venus Cloacina in the Roman Forum. Early Christians alleged the Romans to have had a toilet god in the form of Crepitus, who was also the god of flatulence and was invoked if a person had diarrhoea or constipation. There are no ancient references to Crepitus. They additionally propitiated Stercutius (named from stercus or excrement), the god of dung, who was particularly important to farmers when fertilising their fields with manure. He had a close relationship with Saturn, the god of agriculture. Early Christians seem to have found Stercutius particularly ridiculous; he was a target of mockery for St. Augustine of Hippo in his book City of God in the early 5th century AD. In popular culture Japanese singer-songwriter Kana Uemura had a 2010 Billboard chart-topping hit with \\"Toilet no Kamisama\\", a song about bonding with her grandmother over a goddess living in a toilet.

Life \\"Stolperstein\\" (stumbling block), Cora Berliner, Emser Stra√üe 37, Berlin- Wilmersdorf, Germany She was the fifth and youngest child of Jewish business training school director Manfred Berliner. She had the customary education for girls of her class. After graduation as an external student of a boy's secondary school, she studied mathematics, political, and social science at the universities in Berlin and Heidelberg, graduating in 1916 with honors. The theme of her dissertation was \\"The organization of Jewish youth in Germany: a contribution to the classification of youth care and the youth movement.\\" From 1919 she worked for the municipal government in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, and from 1910-1924 served as a deputy with the Association of Jewish Youth Clubs, for whom she later served as Business Manager and Executive Director in Heidelberg. There she lectured on the theme \\"The Social Clerk in the Municipality\\" in 1918. In 1919 she became a civil servant in the Economics Ministry, becoming a councillor in 1923 and of the leaders of the economics office in 1923. In 1927 she went to London as a consultant to the economic department of the German Embassy. In 1930 she became a Professor of Economics at the Business Teaching Institute in Berlin. In 1933 she lost her position in the civil service and became a compulsory member of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, where she became the head of the department of emigration, a supervisor for teacher education, and deputy chairman of the Jewish Women's Federation. There, she pushed for the establishment of an institution for training (Jewish) kindergarten teachers. She also pushed for social reform and for social work as an academic discipline, in the model of Alice Salomon. In the summer of 1939 Berliner visited Sweden in order to help the local Jewish leaders to negotiate with the Swedish authorities to admit more Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and also to organize a refugee camp in Sweden. However, Berliner returned to her work in Germany before 25 July when her Swedish visa expired.Rudberg, Pontus, The Swedish Jews and the Holocaust, Abingdon & New York 2017, pp. 125-129. On 26 June 1942, together with other employees of the Reichsvereinigung, she was deported to Minsk. Little is known of her last days, but she was most likely murdered in the Maly Trostinets extermination camp. A memorial stone commemorates her life at the Jewish Cemetery in Hannover. Some of her papers are included in the Ida-Seele- Archive.

Events  Deborah Bradley, Lisa's mother, said that Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, discovered her missing around 4:00 a.m. on Tuesday, October 4, 2011. According to Deborah, Lisa had been in her bed when she checked on her at 6:40 p.m. or at 10:40 p.m. Monday night, but when Jeremy came home from his late night job on Tuesday, he discovered \\"many of the home's lights were on, a window was open and the front door was unlocked\\". Debbie also changed her story multiple times during the investigation. Later, the family told police that several cellphones were also missing. During the subsequent investigation, two witnesses were discovered who claimed to have seen a man walking down the street with a baby. Police were able to find and question a man matching the description of one witness, but the other witness claimed that his photo did not match the man they saw. On October 19, 2011, a search was performed of the Irwin home, and court documents showed that a cadaver dog turned up a scent of a dead body that might have been Lisa, near the mother's bed. Items removed from the home at the time the warrant was executed include a multicolor comforter, purple shorts, a multicolor Disney character shirt, a Glo Worm toy, a \\"Cars\\"-themed blanket, rolls of tape and a tape dispenser. During an interview with the Associated Press, Deborah said the police had accused her of being involved in Lisa's disappearance, telling her \\"You did it. You did it. And we have nothing\\", and claimed that she had failed a lie detector test. Deborah and Jeremy announced the following week that they were organizing a reward in hopes that it would result in new information. Jeremy Irwin appeared on the Today Show for an interview regarding the events, saying \\"We just want to make sure that we tell everybody that we're still cooperating. We're still talking to the police. We're doing everything we can to try to find Lisa and bring her home.\\" Bradley was also on the broadcast. In October, the Irwin family reported that an anonymous benefactor had hired a private investigator, and issued a $100,000 reward for Lisa's return. In October 2011, Cyndy Short stopped representing the Irwin family, saying that she was unable to work with the family's other attorney, Joe Tacopina. Lisa's brothers had been scheduled for interviews and to collect DNA samples regarding the case, but their parents cancelled the night before, according to Tacopina,NYC Criminal Defense Attorneys the family's attorney, and have allegedly denied investigators access to the boys. The boys had a second interview on November 10, 2011. A police request for a warrant claims that inconsistent stories from people involved may have hampered early stages of the investigation. In May 2012, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin reported that their debit card had been fraudulently used on a website that provides false birth certificates. The Today Show and America Live both confirmed that the website existed. Their attorney also confirmed that he visited the website. Police have said they are continuing their investigation and they believe Irwin may still be alive. In October 2013, a girl thought to be Lisa was discovered in a Romani camp in Greece.

Grusin is a Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, and former Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies. Education Grusin earned his bachelor's degree with High Distinction in English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1976. He earned his Ph.D in English from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983. Career Grusin has served in both academic and administrative positions throughout his career. He served as an assistant professor in the Department of English at the College of William and Mary from 1983‚Äì86. From 1986‚Äì2001 he taught at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was chair of the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture from 1996‚Äì1999. He was Professor of English at Wayne State University, where he served as English Department Chair from 2001‚Äì2008. In 1999‚Äì2000 he was visiting associate professor of English and William S. Vaughn Visiting Fellow at the Robert Penn Warren Center for Humanities at Vanderbilt University. In 2007 he served as a visiting professor in Media Studies at the University of Amsterdam. Academic interests Grusin's academic work is fundamentally interdisciplinary; his main interests include various aspects of media, environmental, cultural, and American studies. His scholarly concerns focus on the way that the very questions of representation and mediation that preoccupy us today have manifested themselves historically across western culture. He is the author of two books in American studies: Transcendentalist Hermeneutics: Institutional Authority and the Higher Criticism of the Bible (1991); and Culture, Technology, and Creation of America‚Äôs National Parks (2004). He is most known for his 1999 book, Remediation: Understanding New Media (co- authored with Jay David Bolter), which is nationally and internationally regarded as a founding text of the field of new media studies. The work is a fundamentally comparative work beginning from the assumption that media do not possess autonomous formal or technical specificity, but that they exist only in relation to other media forms and practices. The book also argues that new media do not present a historical break or rupture with the past, but rather define their newness through the refashioning or re-mediating of older media practices and forms. Remediation remains popular on a global scale in the new media studies realm, and it has been translated into Italian and Korean, with selections also translated into German, Portuguese, Chinese, and Czech. Grusin's latest book, Premediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11 (2010), develops and extends the theory of premediation. It argues that at least since the new millennium, networked global media seek to ensure that the future is already pre-mediated before it emerges into the present. The book also explores how the phenomenon of premediation produces and maintains a low level of anxiety in relation both to the global war on terror and to such other post-9/11 threats like climate change, cybersecurity, or financial crises. Grusin posits that in our current era of mobile socially networked media, the function of print, televisual, and networked media is to produce and maintain both individual and collective affects of anticipation, which keep the digital citizens of the 21st-century oriented towards the premediated future.

Massey, gave vanishing conditions for certain triad homotopy groups of spaces. Description of the result This connectivity result may be expressed more precisely, as follows. Suppose X is a topological space which is the pushout of the diagram : A\\\\xleftarrow{\\\\ f\\\\ } C \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\ g\\\\ } B, where f is an m-connected map and g is n-connected. Then the map of pairs : (A,C)\\\\rightarrow (X,B) induces an isomorphism in relative homotopy groups in degrees k\\\\le (m+n-1) and a surjection in the next degree. However the third paper of Blakers and Massey in this area determines the critical, i.e., first non-zero, triad homotopy group as a tensor product, under a number of assumptions, including some simple connectivity. This condition and some dimension conditions was relaxed in work of Ronald Brown and Jean-Louis Loday. The algebraic result implies the connectivity result, since a tensor product is zero if one of the factors is zero. In the non simply connected case, one has to use the nonabelian tensor product of Brown and Loday. The triad connectivity result can be expressed in a number of other ways, for example, it says that the pushout square above behaves like a homotopy pullback up to dimension m+n.  Generalization to higher toposes  The generalization of the connectivity part of the theorem from traditional homotopy theory to any other infinity-topos with an infinity-site of definition was given by Charles Rezk in 2010.  Fully formal proof  In 2013 a fairly short, fully formal proof using homotopy type theory as a mathematical foundation and an Agda variant as a proof assistant was announced by Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine; this became Theorem 8.10.2 of Homotopy Type Theory ‚Äì Univalent Foundations of Mathematics. This induces an internal proof for any infinity-topos (i.e. without reference to a site of definition); in particular, it gives a new proof of the original result.

Two companies originally were incorporated by Chinese state-owned enterprises, such as Haikou Meilan International Airport. Hainan Traffic Administration Holding was 50% owned by Tang Dynasty Development (Yangpu) (), 25% by Yangpu Hengsheng Chuangye () and 18.21% by Yangpu Zhongxin Airlines Holding () and 6.78% by Hainan Xinhuading Trading () as of March 2017.

Pan-American Aviation Holding was 100% owned by Guan Jun as of 2016 (, acquired from Bharat Bhis√© in 2016). Yangpu Hengsheng Chuangye was owned by HK incorporated company Headstreams Investment (), which was 98% owned by Bharat Bhis√© and 2% by R.J. Conrads in 2004. As in 2015 Bhis√© still owned 98% of Headstreams Investment, while the 2% stake of Headstreams was owned by Caymans-incorporated HAC (RAC), Limited as in 2011.

The film was released on August 10, 2012 to favourable reviews from critics. Plot Democratic Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) of North Carolina's fictional 14th District is the incumbent, running for his fifth term unopposed. His campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessman brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Wattley reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty. Cam later runs a campaign portraying Marty as an Al Qaeda terrorist, and Marty exposes Cam as a fake Christian by asking him to recite the Lord's Prayer, which he fails to do. Cam attempts to restore his religious image by visiting a church of snake handlers, but he gets bitten by a snake. A video of the bite is leaked into the Internet and goes viral, increasing Cam's popularity. When Cam's son plans to slander his competition for class president, Cam realizes he has set a bad example and visits Marty to make peace. While drunk, Cam tells Marty that he originally became a politician to help people, citing that as class president he had a dangerous, rusty slide removed from the playground. After Cam leaves, Wattley convinces Marty to call the police and report Cam for driving while drunk. Cam is arrested and his campaign is again damaged. Marty later airs a TV ad of Cam's son addressing Marty as \\"dad\\". Cam gets revenge on Marty by seducing his neglected wife Mitzi and recording the act. The released sex tape humiliates the Huggins family and causes Cam's campaign manager, Mitch, to abandon him. Marty retaliates by shooting Cam in the leg on a hunting trip, increasing his own popularity. As the election nears, Marty meets with the Motch brothers and learns of their plans to sell Hammond to their Chinese business partner and turn the town into a factory complex. Marty realizes he has been used and rejects the brothers' support, leading them to defect to Cam's side. Marty meanwhile reconciles with his family. On election day, Cam's victory appears certain until Marty exposes the Motch brothers' intent and promises to preserve Hammond if elected. Cam still wins and remains congressman due to rigged voting machines owned by the Motch brothers. While Cam gloats, Marty shows his large scars to Cam and reveals that he looked up to Cam in school for getting rid of the dangerous slide. Realizing he has strayed from his true objectives as a politician, Cam withdraws from the election and Marty wins by default. Cam earns back Mitch's respect, and Marty later appoints him his chief of staff. Six months later, Marty and Cam expose the Motch brothers, who are called to appear before Congress. The brothers point out that everything they did is legal under Citizens United v. FEC, but they are arrested for their association with Wattley, who is actually an international fugitive.

Background  Cervantes grew up in a small city in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, CA. Her father was a paper box printer and her family's poverty helped foster her interest in art, out of the necessity of creating their own clothing and Halloween costumes. She picked up color theory while helping out her mother pick put clothes at the swap market and observed her father construct and repurpose junk in their garage. Cervantes now lives in San Francisco, California; here, she can enjoy the company of different community groups in her area. She is a voice for the oppressed. In 2004 she graduated UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree and formal training in ethnic studies. With the knowledge and experience she gained here she became the \\"artist for the people\\". She inspired communities by exhibiting struggle and oppression into something an empowering, optimistic, and tangible. Cervantes had a desire to change the way society views oppressed communities. She has hope for radical and social transformation. Her intentions are to exhibit resistance against oppressed groups to spark awareness and curiosity. Identifying as a member of the Chicanx community she is very aware and in touch with the struggles that not only occur in the Bay Area but around the world as well. In 2007, she co-founded Dignidad Rebelde, a graphic arts collaboration based in the Mission in San Francisco that highlights peoples stories of struggle, vision, hopes and dreams. Like Cervantes's work, they highlight the history of colonialism, genocide and exploitation and the effects of it in today's world. The collaboration is a series of prints and multimedia projects that center around Third World (developing countries) and indigenous movements and the erasure and loss of culture of these people. The posters and prints give power to the people- to transform, change, build, and project. Dignidad Rebelde's purpose is to illustrate stories of struggle, resistance and triumph into artwork that can be put back into the hands of the communities who inspire it. The pieces made are to evoke acceptance.  Career  Cervantes works full-time as a Senior Program Officer at the Akonadi Foundation which supports movement-building organizations working to end structural racism in the United States. While at Akonadi she co-founded the Bay Area Justice Funders Network, an alliance of funders working strengthen grantmaking for social justice movements in the Bay Area and beyond. As an artist, Cervantes has exhibited at Galer√≠a de la Raza (San Francisco); Woman Made Gallery and National Museum of Mexican Art (Chicago); Mexic-Arte and Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center (Austin, TX); Crewest (Los Angeles); and at the Mus√©e d'Aquitaine (Bordeaux, France). Her work is in public collections of the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, the Latin American Collection of the Green Library at Stanford, and the Hispanic Research Center at the Arizona State University as well as various private collections throughout the U.S. She formed Dignidad Rebelde with printmaker Jesus Barraza, a collaborative graphic arts project that uses principles of Xicanisma and Zapatismo to translate stories of struggle and resistance into artwork that can be put back into the hands of the communities who inspire it. Their art highlights issues around immigration, prison reform, Third World liberation movements, and economic injustice. Her work can also be found in Dylan Miner's book, Creating Azatl√°n. Cervantes' work has been included in the recent scholarship in Chicana/o studies of revolutionary women of color in Claudia D. Hern√°ndez book Women, Mujeres, Ixoq: Revolutionary Visions. Cervantes is a member of Justseeds Collective, Taller Tupac Amaru, and the Consejo Gr√°fico.

In November 2002 there had been fighting between government forces in Ankoro and the rebel forces who held the territory across the river. The people fled into the bush around the town, where they had to scavenge for food. 100 people were killed and more than 3,000 homes were burned down. Food stored in the town was looted by soldiers and there were no seeds to plant at the start of the rainy season. Over 40% were malnourished. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, in March 2003 World Vision organized a shipment of 626.4 metric tonnes of maize, oil and salt.

M. 2006. Nature, Gardens, and Georgetown. Xylocopa Press, Bethesda, MD. 112 pp. It is a welcome change from the general urban landscape and includes Foundry Branch from Van Ness Street, to Canal Road, along the Potomac River. Several temporary streams, some originating from springs, flow into Foundry Branch. This park is one of the \\"finger parks\\" of Rock Creek Park, administered by the National Park Service (NPS). It prohibits removal of anything from the natural areas of the park. Also, to help preserve it, the NPS prohibits off-leash dogs, bicycles, and motorized vehicles in the park. Dog walkers, hikers, and joggers are often in the park. The park contains a historical Victory Garden adjacent to W Street, N.W. Nature, Gardens, and Georgetown (2006) includes a chapter on the park. History Glover Archbold Park is named after Charles Carroll Glover and Anne Mills Archbold, who donated its land in 1924. The Glover family's pronunciation of its name is \\"glove' er.\\" The National Park Service currently does not hyphenate \\"Glover Archbold Park.\\" Some people erroneously call the park Glover Archibald Park. In 1947, Senator Carl Hayden proposed to build a four-lane divided highway called Arizona Avenue through the Glover Archbold Park, from Canal Road in Georgetown to Wisconsin Avenue in Friendship Heights. Hayden's proposed highway was not built; the path is now the Glover Archbold Trail and the Massachusetts-39th Trail. Weaver Street and Weaver Place were renamed Arizona Avenue in 1954 after a suggestion by the American University Park Citizens' Association. In 1963, the conservationist and writer Rachel Carson, accompanied by several members of the Audubon Naturalist Society, visited Glover Archbold Park. Georgetown University students have been studying and learning from the park since at least 1975. Ecology The park contains thousands of species in the life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear- shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes first appeared in the park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic- mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild- garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white- tailed deer. Park challenges Many things have and are degrading Glover Archbold Park, including air, fertilizer, soil, and water pollution. The sewer system in and near Foundry Branch has changed this stream's course. The park sometimes smells of sewage. Storms periodically cause a strong current in the stream, resulting in erosion, disturbance of stream life, and pollution of its water with road runoff and even raw sewage. People, who are likely unwary of the polluted condition of the water, allow their dogs to drink and walk and bathe in the water. The park is long and narrow (up to 0.25 mile wide and 2.6 miles long), and mostly surrounded by houses and other buildings. Some people extend their yards into the park, and the NPS asks them to stop this practice.

When he arrived at his new post, he found that the vast plans for a massive arsenal complex, conceived by his predecessor, General Thomas J. Rodman, had gotten no further than the preliminary stages. Flager not only developed and completed the major portion of Rodman's great enterprise, but he also authored a highly respected history of the arsenal and its operations, published in 1877. By 1881, he had been advanced to the permanent rank of Lieutenant Colonel. His service at Rock Island Arsenal was punctuated by a series of shorter temporary assignments; including, membership on the Board of Heavy Gun Carriages in New York (January‚ÄìMarch 1873), special inspection duty at Fort Union Arsenal, New Mexico Territory (September 1880), with the specific assignment of winding down the work of that agency; and finally inspection duty at several posts in California, Texas, and New Mexico, completed in February and March 1883.Title page, A History of the Rock Island Arsenal from its Establishment in 1836 to December 1876, by Daniel Webster Flagler, published by U.S. Government Printing Office, 1877 A permanent transfer to command Frankford Arsenal occurred at the end of May 1886.

Flagler was named the 9th Chief of Ordnance and promoted to Brigadier General on January 23, 1891. He entered his new duties admirably equipped by reason of his wide experience, but the Congresses of the 1890s were not disposed to grant the appropriations he considered necessary for the maintenance and upgrading of the Ordnance Department. Efforts were made to improve the nations' coastal defense posture. Considerable testing was done on Gatling guns, the Colt machine gun, gun carriages, armor-piercing projectiles, rifled cannon, various types of gunpowder, and pneumatic dynamite guns. During his tenure, the Army's first smokeless powder and bolt action, magazine rifle, the model 1892 Krag, was adopted.

Mount Zion Cemetery, founded in 1808 as The Old Methodist Burial Ground, was leased property later sold to Mount Zion United Methodist Church. Although the cemetery buried both white and black people since its inception, it served an almost exclusively African American population after 1849. In 1842, the Female Union Band Society purchased the western lot to establish a secular burying ground for African Americans. Both cemeteries were abandoned by 1950. Both cemeteries are considered a single unit, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 1975. History In the early 1800s Georgetown was the northernmost port on the Potomac River. It was a major port for the slave and tobacco trade in the area and a center for mills and markets for the newly created city of Washington. Its population was one-third black - half freedmen and half slaves. In 1808, the Montgomery Street Church (known as Dumbarton Street Methodist Episcopal Church after 1850) purchased the property later known as Mt. Zion Cemetery for the burial of their church members and their slaves. Many blacks attended the Montgomery Street Church. Between 1801 and 1810 their numbers fluctuated between 37 and 97. At times nearly 50% of the congregation consisted of \\"coloured brethren.\\" Dissatisfied because they were segregated within the white church, about 123 blacks attending the Montgomery Street Church met on June 3, 1814, to consider forming a separate congregation under the supervision of the parent church. In 1814, a group of blacks broke off from Montgomery Street Church to establish their own congregation, the Mount Zion Episcopal Church, recognized later as Mount Zion United Methodist Church. The Female Union Band Society, a cooperative benevolent society formed by free black women whose members were pledged to assist one another in sickness and in death, and who desired a separate burying ground for free blacks, in 1842 purchased the West end of the Dumbarton Church Cemetery, adjacent to the Methodist grounds. On May 24th, 1879, Mount Zion United Methodist Church leased the East end of the Dumbarton Church Cemetery for 99 years. In ensuing years these distinct cemeteries were often referred to as the single entity Mount Zion Cemetery. The burial grounds are the resting place of free blacks, slaves and a small number of individuals of European heritage (those not disinterred and reburied in other cemeteries). Various citations suggest several German soldiers, fighting as members of the Kings German Legion in the War of 1812, are buried in the cemetery as well. The cemetery is believed to have served as a station for runaway slaves fleeing the South via the underground railroad. Interments ceased in 1950. The Afro- American Bicentennial Corporation conducted a historical study of the Mt. Zion section of the cemetery. As the Mount Zion Cemetery/ Female Union Band Cemetery is one of the oldest remaining African American cemeteries in Georgetown and greater Washington, D.C., The Joint Committee on Landmarks designated the cemetery a Category II Landmark of importance that contributes to the cultural and visual beauty of the District. It was officially listed in the Register on August 6, 1975 in the areas of Archeology-Historic and Social/Humanitarian with an 1809-1950 period of significance. While the cemetery is located within the Georgetown Historic District, its historical significance is sufficiently different to merit individual registration. The cemetery was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1975, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, on August 6, 1975. Restoration is underway, by Dumbarton United Methodist Church and Trustees of the Female Union Band Society as owners of the properties, together with Mount Zion - Female Union Band Society, Historic Memorial Park, Inc. and the Society for the Preservation of Historic Georgetown.

These mentors are upper classmen who communicate with the international students throughout the academic year to offer support to the new students in their transition. History A student initiated the International Mentoring Program in 1999 to offer peer support to incoming international students at Brown University. The students in the program also helped create International Orientation, which was managed by the Office of Admissions and the Office of International Student and Scholar Services (OISSS) at the time. The program also received support from the Dean of College and Office of Student Life in its early years.Junco, Marco Sanchez (Brown University Project Coordinator). Personal interview, 19 October 2011. 10 am. The Dean of College provided funds while the Office of Student Life helped students in training and in developing the program. The IMP had changed throughout the years as the international student community and applicants grew at Brown. In 2003, the International Orientation and the IMP were placed under the supervision of the Orientation Welcoming Committee. In 2006, the IMP was separated from General Orientation and incoming international students were allowed to move in a day before general freshmen. In 2011, the IMP supported around 250 new internationals and the International Orientation expanded into a four-day program. IMP Mentors and Coordinators =Mentors= The IMP mentors are student volunteers who use their own experience as international students to advise the incoming international freshmen about life at Brown. Students who want to be mentors apply for a position during spring. This is a fairly competitive process as 60-80 students apply for 22 places as a mentor. When the mentors are selected, they begin their work in the summer. The mentors are assigned a region of the world and they communicate with students in the respective regions via email. During this time, mentors introduce themselves to the incoming international freshmen and provide advice about things to bring to Brown. In the fall, mentors attend training sessions for International Orientation, since they will lead activities. Each mentor is then assigned 10-12 incoming international students who will become his or her mentees. When International Orientation begins, these mentors work by participating in various activities with their mentees during the four-day program. The mentor also acts as a resource and offers advice ranging from academics to social life at the university. Throughout the year, mentors keep in contact with their mentees through email, by holding office hours, and by other means. They keep mentees informed of IMP events throughout the academic year, such as the IMP BBQ, Pumpkin Carving, ice-skating, etc. http://www.browndailyherald.com/news/group- combats-international-students-culture-shock-1.2385293#.TqpEkM0TObs Boucher, Nicole.

Students in their sophomore year can apply to be an IMP coordinator, a position held onto for two years. Each year, the group of four coordinators consists of 2 juniors and 2 seniors. The coordinators oversee the IMP Program and the International Orientation, and keep in contact with the mentors. For International Orientation, the coordinators organize events and book venues for various activities. IMP coordinators also take part in the mentor selection process for the upcoming academic year. Traditions =Apple Pie Social= The Apple Pie Social is an IMP tradition, which occurs during the night of the move-in for international students. This event takes place in the Sayles Auditorium on the Main Green at Brown. It is where all the international students and the IMP mentors come together for a meet-and-greet session. Apple pie, apple cider, and lemonade are provided at the venue. Since most international students have just arrived, the event allows them to meet fellow international freshmen. http://students.brown.edu/imp/schedule.htmInternational Orientation Schedule. Brown University. Retrieved 11 October 2011 =Welcoming IMP Brunch= The IMP Brunch takes place on Lincoln Field, on the Lower Green, the morning after the Apple Pie Social. All the IMP members, the international freshmen, and their families are invited to attend the brunch. This is an event in which the Director of International Admissions and the Vice President of Campus Life and Student Services give speeches to welcome the new members of the Brown community. Partnerships =Office of Admissions= The International Mentoring Program works closely with the Office of Admissions during the academic year. As soon as the international students are accepted, the list of their names goes to the IMP. The qualifications of an international student are as follows: # A student applies to Brown using a non-American address. # A student applies from a non-American high school. # A student is a non-US citizen. When students accept their offer to Brown, they are categorized into groups for the mentors. Mentors will then contact these incoming international students in the summer. =Office of International Student and Scholar Services= The Office of International Student and Scholar Services (OISSS) helps international students with immigration and visa issues. An event during International Orientation called ‚ÄúThe Staying Legal Panel‚Äù is led by the Director of OISSS to advise students on employment, immigration, social security, and visa issues. This event is mandatory for all visa students. Future Projects As the number of incoming international freshmen increase at Brown, the IMP is looking for new ways to assist the students in their transitions.

Crane is chairman and chief executive of Crane Capital Group, Crane Worldwide Logistics, and Crane Freight & Shipping. He is also the owner and chairman of the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). Early life and education Crane, who grew up in the north St. Louis suburb of Dellwood, Missouri, attended Lutheran High School North and graduated in 1972. He gave the school a donation of $1 million to improve their athletic facilities and enlarge the size of the campus from 40 acres to 67 in 2004. The school named the James R. Crane Athletic Complex for his contribution. Crane earned a degree in industrial safety from Central Missouri State University (CMSU) (now the University of Central Missouri) in 1976, where he became a member of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. Crane pitched for the Central Missouri Mules baseball team. He was an honorable mention Division II All- American going 21-8 with a 2.42 ERA for UCM. His father died between his freshman and sophomore years, and Crane seriously thought about dropping out of college; however, his coach, Robert N. Tompkins, drove to his home in north St. Louis and talked Crane into returning to school. Career = Freight and logistics = After graduating from college Crane went into the insurance business. He moved to Houston in 1980, and in March 1984 Crane borrowed $10,000 from his sister and founded Eagle USA Airfreight, an air freight logistics business. Eagle USA Airfreight later became Eagle Global Logistics, and then EGL, Inc., and moved into the supply chain management and information services business. In August 2007 EGL merged with United Kingdom-based CEVA Logistics, owned by American private equity capital management and leveraged buyout firm Apollo Management L.P.. Crane owned approximately 17.6% of EGL's stock at the time of the merger. He had wanted to do a leveraged, management, or combination of the two, buyout of EGL, prior to the merger with CEVA, but was unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Later, after Crane obtained equity backing he initially offered $36 per-share for EGL, but Apollo then engaged in a bidding war and the shareholders eventually went with the Apollo/CEVA offer of $47.50 per share. He was opposed to the EGL and CEVA merger. Crane took his profits from EGL and formed Crane Capital Group. He also became a director and shareholder (less than 1%) in Western Gas Holdings, LLC, the general partner in Western Gas Partners, LP, a mid-stream (mainly pipelines and natural gas gathering assets) energy company operating in the southeastern Rocky Mountain region and southern Mid-Continent area (Oklahoma and Texas) of the United States. Western Gas Holdings and Western Gas Partners were acquired by Anadarko Petroleum. Crane is also the majority shareholder in Crane Worldwide Logistics LLC., chairman of the board for CargoJet, and director of both Nabors Industries and natural gas company Western Midstream. = Houston Astros = Crane reached an agreement to purchase the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball from Drayton McLane for a reported $680 million. He was unanimously approved by MLB on November 17, 2011. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig intended for Houston to change divisions from the 6-club National League Central to the 4-club American League West. Crane received $35 million bumps from McLane and the MLB in exchange for this league-change stipulation, which was previously committed to by McLane. When Crane purchased the team, they were coming off a season in which they won only 56 games. During his tenure as owner, the Astros experienced a turnaround in which they had 3 consecutive 100-win seasons, including a World Series victory in 2017. = Other businesses = Crane opened two restaurants in Houston in 2017, Osso & Kristalla and Potente, named for his children. That year, he also started a commercial safety supply and training company called Crane Safety and acquired Davaco, a company that manages and executes high-volume remodels and technology deployments. Also in 2017, Crane started a software company called Modiant to focus on digitizing freight and transportation management. In 2019, he partnered with winemaker Jesse Katz at Aperture Cellars, a winery in Sonoma County. A scratch golfer, Crane has been ranked as the nation's top CEO golfer. In April 2010 he purchased The Floridian National Golf Club from Wayne Huizenga. The Floridian in Palm City, Florida recently completed major renovations and additions under the supervision of architect Tom Fazio. \\"It was two things (owning a team and a golf course) that I never thought I would be able to accomplish,\\" Crane mused at his Floridian National Golf Club's reopening. \\"I was able to pull it together and I am very happy about it.\\"  Controversy  = Eagle Logistics = In 2000, Eagle USA was subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation regarding hiring practices of minorities and women. Jim Crane was named personally in the lawsuit. An outside claims administrator later ruled that only 10% of claims had any validity, and the court returned $6M of the settlement fund to the company as they maintained denial of the allegations. Eagle USA was also sued four separate times for allegations of war profiteering, and settled three cases between 2006 and 2008. Two officials pled guilty to different charges, but Crane himself was not named in those investigations. = Houston Astros = In Commissioner Rob Manfred‚Äôs statement on the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, he noted that ‚ÄúJim Crane was unaware of any of the violations of MLB rules by his Club.‚Äù In response to the scandal, Crane fired the team‚Äôs general manager, Jeff Luhnow, and manager A. J. Hinch. In a press conference a month after the commissioner announced his findings, Crane said that \\"[stealing signs] didn't impact the game.\\" At the same press conference, less than a minute later, he denied having said that and clarified that the Commissioner‚Äôs report stated that it is ‚Äúimpossible to determine whether the conduct actually impacted the results on the field. Personal life During the Memorial Day weekend in 2017, Crane married Whitney Wheeler, now Whitney Crane. The ceremony took place the Floridian National Golf Club. The marriage is Crane's third. He and Wheeler have a son together, James Robert Crane II. Crane's son Jared is senior vice president of executive operations for the Astros. His daughter, Krystal Crane Thompson, is a board member of the Crane Family Foundation. Crane is a supporter of the Democratic Party and frequently golfs with former U.S. president Barack Obama.  Philanthropy  In 1998 Crane was the largest donor in a $1.2 million upgrade of the CMSU baseball stadium, which was then named James R. Crane Stadium.James R. Crane Stadium/Robert N. Tompkins Field. ‚Äì University of Central Missouri. ucmathletics.com. As part of the donation, Crane renamed the baseball field in honor of Robert Tompkins, the CMSU baseball coach who did not let him drop out of school. After buying the Astros in 2011, Crane began expanding the Astros Foundation by contributing donations and securing corporate partnerships. As of 2017, the Foundation had grown from $50,000 to $12 million under his leadership. In 2017, the Foundation‚Äôs Community Leaders Program won MLB‚Äôs 2017 Allan H. Selig Award for Philanthropic Excellence. In 2017, Crane, the Astros ownership group, and the Astros Foundation committed $4 million to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. In 2018, he took ownership of the Houston Open to ensure that it stayed in Houston. The tournament is now operated under the Astros Golf Foundation. In 2020, Crane donated $400,000 as well as 100,000 COVID test swabs and personal protective equipment to support local hospitals fighting the pandemic. Texas Medial Center president and CEO William McKeon said that Jim and Crane Worldwide were instrumental in helping supplies flow to the area. In 2020, Crane and the Astros raised $2.6 million for the Astros Foundation and New Hope Housing.

However, Prime Minister George Papandreou decided to cancel the referendum on 3 November, if the opposition parties vote in favour of the EU deal. The proposed referendum was later cancelled. Background On 31 October 2011, Prime Minister George Papandreou announced the referendum saying that: \\"We need wide consensus (for the aid programme). We are part of the eurozone [which means] many rights and many obligations. We will live up to our obligations.\\" Constitutional issues have arisen with regards to such a referendum, as Article 44 of the constitution of Greece specifies that referenda on critical national matters and social bills are permitted while referenda on fiscal bills are not. This was to be Greece's first referendum not having to do with a change in the form of government, and the first referendum since 1974. Date Papandreou suggested the referendum would be held on 4 December. However, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos specified that the referendum would take place in 2012, after the plans for the haircut had been finalised. Other sources put the date of the referendum to December 2011. According to Nicolas Sarkozy the referendum would have taken place on 4 or 5 December 2011. Opinion polls Polls in Greece suggested that up to 60% of Greeks were against the deal reached with the EU over Greek debt on 27 October 2011, however a survey in September 2011 showed that 63% of Greeks viewed the euro as something positive. The same survey showed that 66% of Greeks viewed the return to the drachma as something negative. Response =Domestic= The initial response of the Greek political parties was negative. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras described it as an \\"indirect national schism\\", while most opposition parties demanded elections and condemned the government for what they perceived to be a maneuvre to avoid early elections. Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece between 1990 and 1993, described the move to hold a referendum as utterly irrational and irresponsible. The Greek media also adopted a negative stance, with many calling it a coercive move. Following the announcement of the referendum on 31 October 2011, 1 November saw the resignation of one MP from the ruling party, lowering Papandreou's government majority to 152 seats in the 300-seat Hellenic Parliament. An additional six members of Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement have demanded early elections. In the early hours of 2 November 2011, George Papandreou and his cabinet decided to speed up the referendum process, and attacked the Greek media by calling them bankrupt and accusing them of having \\"gone mad\\" over the referendum. Additionally the cabinet decided that a committee would be set up to decide the time when the referendum would take place and the question that people would be asked to vote on, but only after the basic characteristics of the new memorandum with the Troika had been decided. During that cabinet meeting, a number of ministers expressed concerns over the referendum. ;Financial markets The Athex stock market index fell amid concerns for instability,http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_04/11/2011_413373 as well as global financial markets on concerns about EU stability and a possible Greek default on its debt. Cancellation On 3 November, Papandreou canceled the referendum plans, saying that a referendum was unnecessary as the opposition New Democracy Party had indicated that it would support an agreement with European leaders on writing down Greece's sovereign debt in exchange for the adoption of austerity measures and a commitment to maintaining the euro.Rachel Donadio & Niki Kitsantonis, Greek Leader Calls Off Referendum on Bailout Plan, The New York Times (November 4, 2011). The cancelation occurred following the opposition of Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, and amid calls for Papandreou to resign. In response, global financial markets rose. Following an emergency visit to Cannes for the 2011 G-20 Cannes summit, where Papandreou faced pressure to call off the referendum, New Democracy's spokesman Yiannis Michelakis said that \\"the comments made by Mr Papandreou, as well as those by [French President] Nicolas Sarkozy and [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, revealed that he suggested to them that in Greece there is a supposed questioning of whether Greece should remain in the eurozone and the European Union. It is clear that no such problem exists and that Mr Papandreou ‚Äì through sudden and despicable misinformation ‚Äì is trying to create it himself.\\" Party chairperson Antonis Samaras also said that \\"the only problem that exists is Mr Papandreou remaining as prime minister,‚Äù said Michelakis. ‚ÄúHe is dangerous and he has to go.\\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_4080_03/11/2011_412992 The referendum was later canceled amidst domestic and foreign pressure. U.S. President Barack Obama said that though the G20 summit in Cannes sought to alleviate European sovereign debt concerns the \\"actions of Papandreou and the referendum issue got a lot of people nervous\\" and the EU proposal was \\"still the best recipe.\\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the cancellation was a good decision amidst possible eurozone impatience with Greece. \\"It was a bizarre proposal. We think it‚Äôs of great importance to the eurozone that we prevent Greece from going bankrupt. But in the end, the euro is more important than Greece‚Äôs membership of the eurozone.\\" Conversely former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that: \\"It‚Äôs no surprise Papandreou hardly had a chance to push through what was being demanded from him. The conservatives across Europe did very little to convince the Greek conservative opposition to stop acting irresponsibly.\\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_05/11/2011_413386 Vote of confidence During discussions for a vote of confidence held on 4 November 2011, Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek Minister of Finance, expressed his view that the decision on whether or not Greece should remain in the Eurozone is not something that should not be put to a referendum, and called for a government of national unity. On 3 November, two other members of Papandreou's parliamentary group announced they would not give the government a vote of confidence. This lowered the ruling party's parliamentary group votes to 150, which was below the threshold for majority in the parliament (151 seats). Dimitris Lintzeris, a PASOK MP, said that \\"Papandreou is past\\" and that \\"he continues to act carelessly and turns his failure into a coercive [referendum]\\". Amid concerns that Greece could leave the eurozone dependent on the referendum result, Papandreou faced a vote of confidence in parliament on 4 November. He said that \\"I ask for the vote of confidence to avert the instability that would be caused if the country is dragged into elections. Now is the time for cooperation with good intentions and a feeling of national responsibility.\\" Before the vote he pledged to step down saying that re- election was not important to him, thus avoiding infighting within PASOK; he also said that he would seek a coalition government for four months in order to pass the new EU debt agreement, though New Democracy rejected such a motion to join a coalition government. The motion passed with a vote of 153-145 in the 300 seat parliament, after PASOK's 152 MPs and Louka Katseli, formerly a member of PASOK, supported the prime minister. She was then brought back into the party fold.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/2011114212835975841.html =New government= Following the vote of confidence, Papandreou met President Karolos Papoulias the next day to begin talks on forming a new coalition government. Papandreou also said that he would resign and allow another interim prime minister. Though New Democracy's Samaras demanded a snap election, an interim coalition government could have possibly involved Popular Orthodox Rally, Democratic Alliance and/or the Democratic Left. However, Democratic Alliance chairperson Dora Bakoyannis said that an interim government to pass the EU demanded austerity measures must include New Democracy to make the government viable. Bakoyiannis also added that \\"there is no point in us supporting Papandreou without Samaras, we don't have enough votes to make a difference anyway. We'll support a coalition and vote with them, without any demands of positions, if Papandreou and Samaras can work it out.\\" Though Samaras continued to demand a new election in saying that was the only option for \\"stabilisation of the country, to restore its image, and to emerge sooner from this nightmare,\\" he also added that an interim coalition government was a good idea in order to pass the bailout bill. Papandreou also said that: \\"My aim is to immediately create a government of co-operation. A lack of consensus would worry our European partners about our country's membership of the eurozone.\\" He added that forming a coalition meant that he would \\"do whatever I can to help form a coalition government. The Oct. 26 decisions and obligations stemming from this are a condition for the country remaining in the euro.\\" An anonymous member of PASOK suggested that Papandreou believed that Venizelos was the most appropriate person to head am interim coalition government as \\"Venizelos is the main negotiator in Europe, so there will be continuity, although New Democracy is fiercely against this proposal.\\" Papandreou also hoped that a new government would be formed by 7 November, before eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the next scheduled bailout fund for Greece. However, according to PASOK, Papandreou would not resign until there was clarification on who would lead the coalition government and that he wanted a new government in the following week. LAOS also added that Samaras should reconsider his position as forming a coalition government has been \\"achieved with the departure of Papandreou from power.\\" Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos added that an interim administration would serve until the end of February, after which a new election would be called following the passage of the 8-billion-euro loan tranche.http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_05/11/2011_413394 Papandreou added that \\"elections at this moment not only equal disaster but could not take place in the best interest of the people. There is one solution. To support the [EU bailout] deal with a multiparty approach, without elections, with a strong government\\" and that he sought to \\"immediately create a government of co-operation [because] a lack of consensus would worry our European partners about our country's membership of the eurozone.\\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111591628572478.html An unnamed senior member of PASOK said that Papandreou would resign as soon as a new government is formed, possibly on the night of 6 November.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111613435173466.html On 6 November, Papandreou and Samaras agreed to the formation of a new coalition government that would not be led by Papandreou following a meeting with Papoulias. Papoulias' office issues a statement that read the leader of the government would be decided by the leaders of the largest parties the following day, but it did no mention the tenure of the government. However, Papandreou said that \\"it is clear that this government will pass the baton but it will not pass it to a void - it will pass it to a new government, if we agree on it, and I hope this will happen soon. I'm not interested in being prime minister in the new government;\\" he also added that a new election should not be held before February or March until the bailout legislation is approved by parliament The announcement also followed a European Union deadline before a finance minister meeting on 7 November about the formation of a government and the enactment of a bailout agreement. Papoulias said that \\"an agreement was reached to form a new government to immediately lead the country to elections after ratifying the decisions taken by the European Council.\\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/2011116203756981236.html Lucas Papademos was suggested as the possible leader of a new government. He later agreed to be the interim prime minister until a future election.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111895652345832.html At the last minute there was controversy over Papademos amongst both PASOK and New Democracy and a joint announcement for the new PM was put off till 10 November. Samaras blamed PASOK for the delay saying that the constitution demanded that the ruling party had the prerogative to name a candidate for prime minister. In what Al Jazeera called an \\"apparent farewell address\\" Papandreou said on television that: \\"We have agreed on someone who will unite us. I would like to wish every success to the new prime minister and of course the new government. I will stand by them and I will support them with all my strength.\\" =International= ;Supranational *: President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy have issued a joint statement expressing their faith in the agreement of 27 October 2011 and that the country will honour the agreements it has made with the Eurozone and the world. Joseph Daul, chairman of the European People's Party in the European Parliament, characterised the move to hold a referendum as \\"verging on a violation of the Maastricht Treaty.\\" *G20: Though the 2011 G-20 Cannes summit was intended to discuss reforms to the global monetary system and to rein in financial speculation and capital flows, the surprising decision to hold the referendum caused a change to the discussions as the European Financial Stability Facility took precedence over other issues. *IMF: Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund, said that the next installment of the Greek bailout would be decided in December, after the referendum has taken place. ;International *: Central Bank Governor Mark Carney stressed the importance of Greece seeking democratic support for the proposed economic restructuring. *: President Nicolas Sarkozy, said that he was 'appalled' by the move to bring the agreement to a referendum. *: The Ministry of Finance described the move as an internal development and declined to make a statement. *: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said the decision to move to a referendum was surprising and having a negative impact on the markets. *: The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said \\"The decision of the Greek prime minister has added to the instability and uncertainty in the Eurozone.\\" *: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney expressed the U.S. government's opinion that the move to put the bailout deal to a referendum shows that Europe needs to implement the agreement rapidly.

The UAW was established in Sydney on 31 July 1950 in New South Wales. Branches in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania soon followed. In 1956 a national UAW was set up, with an executive committee based in Sydney and representatives from each state organisation. The UAW's self-published magazine, Our Women, mixed mainstream content such as recipes with news from the trade union movement, tracts on women's equality and articles on Aboriginal rights. Although the UAW was never officially affiliated with any political party many of its founding members were in close contact with Communist Party of Australia. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) kept the organisation under surveillance during the 1950s and '60s. The UAW campaigned for women's rights to work, with equal pay and conditions, affordable childcare, Indigenous rights and the environment, and strongly protested against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War. The UAW vigorously protested against the South African apartheid movement. International Women's Day was almost solely organised by the UAW in the early years after World War II and the UAW organised the first United Nations-sponsored international conferences for women in 1975, International Women's Year. The UAW enjoyed success in the 1950s and 1960s with their combination of the conventional and subversive, being a \\"product of both mainstream and left culture\\" but were considered conservative by the post-Vietnam Women's liberation movement. By the late 1980s and 1990s, the UAW began winding down. Currently the Victorian UAW continues, its website is at uaw.org.au .The UAW (Vic) is currently the National body as well as the Victorian body. The President is Anne Sgro: Secretary Cath Morrison. It publishes a monthly Newsletter.  History  The UAW was established in Sydney on 31 July 1950 as the successor to the New Housewives' Association (NHA), with the first branch formed in New South Wales, soon followed by Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The Northern Territory had a branch revived from the defunct Darwin Housewives' Association, but purportedly attracted few members due to concerns of Communist affiliation. In 1956, the national UAW organisation was formed, comprising an executive committee based in Sydney and representatives from each state organisation. While executive decisions on national/international issues and state issues were planned at the national and state levels respectively, the bulk of activities were carried out by suburban (and regional) sub-groups in each state (e.g. Sunshine and Mildura respectively in Victoria). Through this grassroots approach, the UAW was on one hand able to connect housewives and mothers in local communities to national or international issues beyond the home, and on the other, provide the organisational backing to campaign for improvements in their members' immediate surroundings‚Äîsuch as child-minding centres in Rockhampton. = Maternalism = The UAW's name, as opposed to the NHA's, reflected their aim to attract \\"all women\\", recognising that those who stayed in the post-war workforce were no longer necessarily housewives and would want to identify otherwise. Undated UAW flyer inviting women from various backgrounds to join Nevertheless, the domestic focus persevered, especially through the 1950s, shaping what has come to be called UAW's \\"maternalist\\" approach. The working- class mothers and housewives who comprised the bulk of earlier UAW membership did challenge traditional maternalism by recognising the necessity for women to work, and in Victoria overcame traditional maternalist policies by advocating local and subsidised childcare for all working women. Nevertheless, they subscribed to the underlying notion that children were a woman's responsibility, which informed their stance on issues from living costs to environmental damage, and especially war. The UAW's significant peace activism stemmed from the perceived universal concern of mothers over the mental and physical well-being of children. Women protesting with UAW banner and apron during Aldermaston peace march in Brisbane, 1964 Maternalism provided the ideological backdrop for domestic activities, such as apron-making and millinery demonstrations, to comfortably coexist alongside equally important discussions on serious political issues in local group meetings. Similarly, the UAW's self-published magazine, Our Women, juxtaposed mainstream content such as recipes, light-hearted chat and fashion tips against the latest workers' union news, tracts on women's equality and articles on Aboriginal rights. The UAW's discourse on the universality of motherhood followed a long tradition of uniting women across race, class, and even national divisions, providing an impetus for local women to agitate for change \\"from within, rather than from the fringes of, mainstream society\\". = Political affiliation = Although the UAW was never officially affiliated with any political party, it was associated with the Communist movement from its inception. Many of its founding members were Communist women who kept in close contact with Communist Party of Australia, which, along with the NHA and other UAW-affiliated organisations, narrowly avoided dissolution by the defeated Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth). When, in 1954, the UAW collected individual signatures supporting a ban on hydrogen and atomic bombs and sent them to then-Federal Minister for Labour and National Service Harold Holt, Holt sent back each slip to its signatory, denouncing the UAW as \\"completely under the control of the Communist Party of Australia\\", characterising their methods as \\"insidious\\" and \\"deceptive\\". Former CPA members later claimed the CPA had little direct involvement in the UAW's actions and that the UAW was \\"not a danger to the status quo\\". However, the circumstances surrounding the UAW's formation and individual members' actions in the politically hostile Cold War environment earned it the continued scrutiny of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation through the 1950s and 1960s. Member Barbara Curthoys claimed that every state branch had \\"at least one ASIO agent\\" in a book launch of the UAW's official history. Accordingly, the UAW did not keep a full record of members during that period. Despite initial condemnation by the New South Wales Australian Labor Party, the UAW also attracted ALP members such as Nola Barber after the party split in 1955 and relaxed its ban on members from joining Communist-linked organisations. At the local level, the UAW focused on the everyday lives of its members and sought to relate them to broader political issues, rather than dictate party policy. Women's issues One of the UAW's key concerns was the well-being of women across the world. While the UAW located women within its broader campaigns (see sections below), it also focused on women's issues pertinent to its largely working-class membership of housewives and young mothers in the relatively anti-feminist early Cold War era. They campaigned for women's rights to work and receive equal treatment, hand-in-hand with affordable and universal childcare. With the rise of the Women's Liberation movement in the 1970s, reproductive rights and contraception became an additional focus, although the UAW's persistent maternalist and domestic approach struggled to keep up with the eventual trajectory of feminism. 1963 flyer from Sydney, urging women to vote. =Women in the workplace= The UAW started off in an environment hostile to the notion of women joining the workforce, despite the availability of work, availability of time afforded by advances in domestic technology, and the necessity for working-class households to meet rising costs of living (another target of the UAW's efforts; see below). Initial protests and letter-writing campaigns for equal pay therefore received little support from the public and even from worker's unions, whose ideas of equal family wages rested mostly on men earning the bulk of income. Nevertheless, the UAW realised working with unions would be the most effective, petitioning and vocally advocating for the issue without letting it be ignored, even as many UAW members did not personally insist on being independent earners. By the late 1960s, the tide was inevitably turning as women continued to take up work; most UAW members were now employed, although regular participants necessarily accorded their own jobs a secondary role in order to participate in UAW activities. At this point the UAW voluntarily cooperated with the nascent Women's Liberation Movement organisation in Australia, actively distributing leaflets at rallies. The UAW's most noted contributions were submissions to the National Wage Cases: firstly in 1969, where 6-year UAW member and future Parliament member Joan Child acted as spokesman for the ACTU's test case; then in 1972 alongside the Women's Electoral Lobby with partial success, followed by 1974 and 1983. As the UAW saw their efforts come to fruition with the introduction of progressive legislation and encouraging results in the workforce, they remained persistent in supporting equal treatment at the workplace. In 1981, for example, NSW state secretary Lee Gorman pledged the UAW's support in pursuing the case of four women appealing to the Anti-Discrimination Board for being stood down by the Urban Transit Authority for being pregnant. =Childcare= Childcare was one of the UAW's earliest and most significant concerns. Their advocacy for working women was inextricably linked to their push for government-supported childcare accessible by all women. This was consistent with their position that mothers, not both parents, were responsible for children's welfare, and thus childcare was purely a women's issue. While this position fell out of favour with the feminism of women's groups from the 1970s onwards, it was once ahead of its time, challenging the traditional maternalist thinking dominant in the 1950s and 1960s, which dictated that women had to look after their children at home. The UAW's efforts were particularly vigorous in Victoria, where childcare (commonly referred to as child-minding) through the 1950s and 1960s was considered a last resort‚Äîa recourse only for single mothers, the destitute and otherwise \\"unfortunate\\". Married women who required childcare to work were urged to put their family first instead. Local authorities were slow in regulating the mushrooming private childcare institutions, and insistent that childcare/pre- school services not enable mothers to \\"park children\\". In response, the UAW, despite their relatively limited political influence, worked at local levels by making mothers aware of existing efforts, and collecting data to present to local authorities as evidence establishing the pressing need for quality, accessible childcare and preschool services. Crucially, this involved lobbying for local government funding as well as higher child endowments. Although the UAW met with limited success in the 1950s and early 1960s, it was ironically near the end of the 1960s, when they started losing members to the Women's Liberation movement, that their efforts to lay the necessary groundwork paid off. Childcare became a mainstream concern, and prominent UAW members such as Alma Morton built on their experience to become leaders in the successful Victorian community childcare movement. Anne Sgro was active in her local area in establishing an early childcare centre. =Women's health and reproductive rights= The UAW initially took a broad approach towards women's health, organising public meetings and letter-writing campaigns on topics from cervical cancer to childbirth. On the issue of contraception and reproductive rights, members in the 1950s and 1960s generally tended to be ambivalent, particularly over the issue of abortion, with many preferring to place their faith in the medical profession for making individual decisions. Although the UAW was more assertive than the public on women's health, they were less progressive than most women's groups in the 1960s. By the 1970s, however, this hesitant position was untenable as birth control became a central topic of mainstream public discussion. The UAW's conservative approach quickly became more supportive, with members successfully lobbying with the Women's Liberation movement for the removal of tax on contraceptives in 1973. Victorian members worked against anti-abortionists taking over the directory boards of the Royal Women's and Queen Victoria hospitals between 1970 and 1975, and publicly countered their attempts to exclude abortion from the Medicare rebate scheme. 1973 also saw the UAW officially incorporate a pro- choice policy. National Issues The UAW was also concerned with broader national issues that manifested in national, state, and local-level action. Chief among these issues were living standards, Indigenous rights and the environment. =Living Standards campaigns= Purchasing power was a matter of great concern to the UAW's mostly working-class membership, who used the opportunity in the UAW to protest against price increases in the face of static wages. One of their first actions was a city rally, organised in 1950 in conjunction with the Trades Union Defence Committee. The Korean War saw the price of living in Australia rise by 21% in 1951, which spurred the UAW to heat up their campaign for an affordable decent standard of living. They would conduct surveys and draw up petitions on the cost of living, which would then be passed on to unions as evidence in wage cases. The UAW argued their own cases as well‚Äîfor example, in a 1953 inquiry on milk prices in Sydney, where the UAW president spoke from the viewpoint of a mother responsible for her children's nutrition. UAW flyer on price rises, 1964 In 1964, the UAW had a successful submission to the Milk Board on behalf of pensioners. This would be one of their limited victories in the area of campaigning for affordability. Despite these efforts, in 1970 The Herald reported that the \\"price of living had increased faster than the minimum wage\\". In response, the UAW joined about a dozen militant groups in a discussion of the cost of living and price control. As the women of the union aged, they continued to monitor and comment on wages and living costs, but their focus shifted to the needs and living standards of senior citizens and pensioners, whose static pensions were particularly affected by inflation. =Indigenous rights activism= The UAW was an early, ardent and constant supporter of Indigenous rights, striving to promote racial equality consistent with their left-wing opposition to oppression. They were affiliated with Aboriginal groups such as the Aboriginal Advancement League (AAL) and the Council for Aboriginal Rights (CAR) with some members serving on their committees. UAW member Shirley Andrew was the first secretary for the CAR in Victoria in 1952, and prominent Aboriginal activist Pearl Gibbs served on the management committee of the UAW's NSW branch, acting as an important link between the Aboriginal and women's movements. As well as sending representatives to attend AAL and CAR meetings, the UAW encouraged Aboriginal members to join, such as Melva Walsh, who was the vice-president of the Moe, Victoria UAW group in the 1960s and led an eventually successful campaign on land rights for Indigenous people forced off the Lake Tyers reserve in the 1960s. The UAW also invited Kath Walker/Oodgeroo Noonuccal and Gladys O'Shane (mother of Pat O'Shane) to speak regularly at meetings, where they were widely welcomed. Notably, the UAW also strived to depict Indigenous people in a positive light in their magazine Our Women, in stark contrast to mainstream media at the time. The UAW's constant lobbying against racist laws in the 1950s and 1960s were finally vindicated by the 1967 Australian referendum, where over 90% of Australians voted to give Australian Aborigines citizenship as well as equal rights under federal jurisdiction. From this point, Indigenous organisations began to gain greater agency and were able to rely on their own voice. Nevertheless, the UAW continued to aid and support Indigenous people where possible. In 1970, the UAW were active in aiding the Roper River People's land rights claim and then in September 1971 they similarly aided the Gurindji people. Between 1971 and 1974, the UAW held fourteen meetings focusing on Indigenous issues and racism, as well as inviting Aboriginal women to speak at the 1972 and 1974 International Women's Day celebrations, and having members who shared their experience in northern and inland Australian Indigenous communities. Over the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Indigenous rights movement had come into its own, and eventually drifted away from the UAW. While the organisational relationships faded, the UAW nevertheless remained fully supportive of Indigenous causes and continued to contribute when possible, such as donating a third of a received bequest to the Oenpelli Community School. =Environmental lobbying= The UAW was one of the first urban women's groups to act on environmental issues, starting in the 1960s after being inspired by ideas brought from America in books such as Silent Spring, and the controversy over Agent Orange. The establishment of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1966 consolidated national interest in environmental concerns; however, the UAW did not officially affiliate with the ACF until 1976. The UAW's interest in the environment was most consistently maintained by country members; it was \\"ad hoc\\", shifting from topic to topic as suited the more influential members. Their focus in the 1960s was to petition local and state governments against the use of harmful pesticides such as dieldrin, which then shifted to the protection of bushland and promotion of recycling. Bringing it back to a domestic angle, the UAW placed particular emphasis on personal responsibility to reduce waste in the household. The UAW also maintained a constant anti-nuclear stance that was mostly focused on the destructive potential of nuclear weapons, but also stemmed from their maternal concern over the long-term environmental consequences future generations would have to bear. They stood alongside environmental groups in firmly opposing uranium mining in Australia, particularly the Australian government's controversial decision to invest in uranium mining in 1977. One of the UAW's last major environmental acts was to petition the government to seek a heritage listing for Kakadu National Park in 1989, in consideration of its significance to the Aboriginal traditional owners, and the environmental threat posed by the nearby Ranger Uranium Mine. International issues In addition to supporting local causes, the UAW was also vocal on international causes, particularly peace. Through personal correspondence and grassroots campaigns, they addressed conflicts related to issues of equality and freedom, and strongly protested against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War. While the UAW likely had minimal impact on foreign affairs, organisation leaders were motivated by an \\"ideological commitment\\" and members gained the satisfaction of being part of an international movement. Decisions made at the executive level were often informed by their links to other Communist-related organisations, such as the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). As such, the shift of power during the Cold War had a noticeable influence on the UAW's international outlook. =Vietnam War= The UAW was fundamentally committed to peace, both from a general anti-violence perspective and a feminist/maternal one, which championed the nurturing, peaceful qualities of mothers. This rhetoric created an obligation to protest, by specifically highlighting the damage war had on children. Consequently, the UAW staunchly opposed the most problematic war during their peak period of activity‚Äîthe Vietnam War. UAW members participated in moratoriums and launched letter- writing campaigns that encouraged disarmament while objecting to conscription and the imprisonment of draft resisters. Some members, notably Nola Barber, banded with women from other organisations to form the successful Save Our Sons organisation in 1965. When five Save Our Sons members, later dubbed the Fairlea Five, were jailed in Fairlea for distributing anti-war pamphlets, the UAW publicly supported their release. QLD branch of UAW, date unknown Unfortunately, as the peace movement was inherently linked to Communism for much of the 1950s and 1960s, the UAW started out with little support. However, by the end of the 1960s, anti-Vietnam sentiment began mirroring the highly publicised American popular opinion, and the UAW went from being relatively radical to conservative. The UAW also kept close correspondence with the Vietnamese Women's Union, visiting North Vietnam as their guests even as Australia was still at war with the country. After the war's conclusion, the UAW sent support for the improvement of conditions in Hanoi. =Nuclear testing= Central to the peace movement was a strong objection to the use of nuclear weapons. The UAW took a particularly maternalist interpretation of this, focusing on the universal plight of children during war, and particularly nuclear warfare, which could leave a mark for decades on children's lives. From the 1960s through to the 1980s, the UAW opposed French and Chinese atmospheric nuclear testing, stood alongside environmental groups in opposing uranium mining, spread petitions during the 1980s nuclear arms race, and were committed to supporting the 1983 Royal Commission into the United Kingdom's atomic testing on Australian sites. UAW members protesting nuclear energy with banner and aprons, Brisbane, 1964 However, while peace united many members earlier in the organisation's lifetime, it also proved to be a divisive sticking point later on. The UAW's executive committee was affected by a \\"pro-Soviet bias\\", choosing not to take specific action against the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Opinions over the Partial Test Ban Treaty also caused a split along ideological lines, eventually contributing to the UAW's gradual decline. =Anti-Apartheid= The UAW protested the South African apartheid movement since the 1950s, maintaining support for various anti-apartheid citizens and figures, including Elizabeth Mafekeng and Helen Joseph. In addition, they boycotted multiple avenues of African trade due to their stance on apartheid. Their long-standing support of the African National Congress was finally acknowledged by Nelson Mandela when he visited Sydney in 1990. =International Women's Day/Year= After the war, International Women's Day was almost solely organised by the UAW for a few years, as many other organisations feared the communist associations of the event. For the UAW, it was a rare opportunity to interact with international guests and migrants, connecting local women with international movements. As the UAW continued supporting it, public attitudes turned from hostility and disapproval to indifference in the 1960s, and then finally to far greater support in the 1970s with the rise of Women's Liberation. In 1972, the UAW collaborated with other organisations to conduct a highly successful rally of 2‚Äì3000 people in Melbourne. The UAW's efforts culminated in their role in organising the first United Nations-sponsored international conferences for women in 1975, which the United Nations declared International Women's Year. Prominent attendees included Elizabeth Anne Reid and Margaret Whitlam, as well as Joan Child who was now able to assist as a Member of Federal Parliament. In addition to appropriating and implementing the proposals established at these initial conferences, they continued to participate in several of the UN's \\"International Decade for Women\\" conferences worldwide. =International guests and exchanges= The UAW's founding undercurrent of coupling Soviet-influenced internationalism with the \\"common female experience\\" promoted regular interaction with individuals and organisations from multiple countries, often women's unions that shared similar goals and philosophies. Among these, the most prominent and long- standing affiliation was with the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), of which UAW national president Freda Brown went on to serve as president from 1975 to 1989. Traditional women's organisations shied away from associating with in the 1950s due to the WIDF's Communist reputation., but the UAW proudly and frequently featured WIDF-produced content in their magazine Our Women, offering suburban housewives a connection to socialist women's movements across the world. Over the years, the UAW formally received foreign nationals from various countries. The UAW's tendency to invite women from socialist and communist countries would sometimes result in minor controversies during the Cold War. One example was when the UAW invited visitors from the People's Republic of China in 1962, when the Australian government did not officially recognise their citizens, causing an unnamed large firm to pull out of an exhibition they were to co-sponsor with the UAW. Even in 1980, one of the UAW's Russian guests attracted media attention for being completely unaware of the federal ban on Russian entry. Through international contacts, the UAW also concerned itself with individual plights of socio-political importance, such as the imprisonment of prominent civil rights activist Angela Davis. Legacy The UAW enjoyed success in the 1950s and 1960s with their combination of the conventional and subversive, being a \\"product of both mainstream and left culture\\". However, this also proved to be their weak point, as the UAW's continued focus on peaceful motherhood started to seem outmoded and ineffective to a new generation of activists and campaigners in the vigorous post-Vietnam Women's Liberation movement. The Sydney branch in particular experienced several clashes with the Women's Liberation groups, and were accused of being \\"conservative\\" and \\"ladylike\\". While the UAW did attempt to keep up, reflected by the increasing seriousness of content in Our Women and records of continuous efforts through the 1970s, they struggled to identify with the concepts and approaches of this new wave of feminism, not only failing to attract many new members but losing others to more radical feminist groups. Furthermore, the mothers and housewives that comprised most of their membership began dedicating more time to work and less time to the UAW. Membership steadily declined; in Victoria, the UAW went from an estimated 5‚Äì600 members in the 1950s to 400 in 1960, 300 in 1964 and around 200 by the end of the 1970s, at which they stayed throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The small Western Australian and Tasmanian branches disbanded around this time as well. Another cause of the organisation's decline was the Sino- Soviet split that affected the CPA, resulting in the formation of the pro- Soviet Socialist Party of Australia (SPA). By then, the UAW had only a loose association with the CPA, but conflicts nevertheless arose between the CPA- aligned Victorian branch and the SPA-aligned New South Wales and national executive committees, especially over the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Given that the UAW's local operations aimed to politicise the everyday and not necessarily along party lines, some members left in disappointment over the extent to which the Sino-Soviet split spilled over into the UAW; others left after questioning the executive-level support of controversial policies in Communist countries. Although by 1991, the CPA's closure had no effect on the UAW and the UAW's support for paternity leave in 1989 represents an interesting update of their maternalist foundation, they never quite recovered from the decrease in membership and effectiveness caused by the compromised leadership and ideological divides of the 1970s and 1980s. By the late 1980s and 1990s, the organisation had shrunk considerably, with the gradual dissolution and amalgamation of local groups and the streamlining of the national committee in 1993. Political and organisational disagreements led to a lapse in relations with the WIDF in the 1980s, culminating in the end of a long-held affiliation in 1996. As their members entered old age, some passing away, the UAW itself eventually began winding down, and the national organisation closed in 1995. The NSW branch followed suit in 1996, the Queensland branch in 1999. Currently, only the Victorian UAW survives, headed by Anne Sgro. It remains active (2019) , with a recorded statement from 2011 strongly denouncing the bombing of Afghanistan and the Australian government's treatment of asylum seekers, particularly in the Tampa affair. Their website lists activities for February 2019 Affiliations The UAW has, throughout its history, campaigned alongside other organisations across various fields. They often worked in conjunction with unions and women's groups to send out stronger messages and bring about social change. The joint intervention in the 1983 National Wage Case with the Women's Electoral Lobby and National Council of Women was an example. Some notable organisations the UAW stated affiliation with include: * Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA) * UNIFEM * UNICEF * Waterside Workers' Federation and Seamen's Union of Australia Women's Committees * Women's Electoral Lobby (WEL) * Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) * Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) Selected publications The UAW released a range of periodic publications during the height of their activity, the most representative being mixed-content magazine, Our Women, which ceased publication in 1971 owing to the changed circumstances of the UAW. They also released official histories of the national (More Than a Hat and Glove Brigade) and Queensland (Daring to Take a Stand) branches near their closures. A comprehensive history of the Victorian branch (Left-Wing Ladies) was published in 2000 by non-members Suzanne Fabian and Morag Loh.

Each Latin city sent a representative and offerings such as sheep, cheese, or other pastoral products. The presiding Roman consul offered a libation of milk, and conducted the sacrifice of a pure white heifer that had never been yoked. The flesh was consumed as part of a communal meal as a sacrament. As part of the festivities, the figurines called oscilla were hung from trees.Fowler, Roman Festivals, pp. 96‚Äì97.

Discovery In 1866, the archaeologist √âdouard Dupont discovered a prehistoric lower jaw in the Trou de la Naulette, a cave near the village of Furfooz in the Belgian province of Namur. A further excavation the following year led to the discovery of other cranial remains, including a complete skull. Of these two crania, one was brachycephalic (round-headed) and another was mesocephalic. In scientific literature from the late 19th and early 20th century, the skulls from Furfooz were considered to represent a round-headed early racial type in Upper Paleolithic Europe, distinct from the Cro-Magnon and ancestral to the Alpine race. Age The remains at Furfooz are dated to the Magdalenian period, or slightly earlier from 20,000‚Äì15,000 years ago. Racial identification The crania at Furfooz were linked in earlier scientific sources to another brachycephalic skull (but dated to the early Neolithic) which was unearthed at Grenelle (Paris, France) in 1870. In the scientific literature of John Lubbock (1890), Samuel Laing (1892), Arthur Keith (1912), Henry Fairfield Osborn (1916), Madison Grant (1918) and Amadeus William Grabau (1921) the findings became known as the \\"Grenelle-Furfooz Men\\" or \\"Furfooz race\\". Earlier Quatrefages de Br√©au in his Crania Ethnica (1875) popularised the view that the brachycephalic (round-headed) Grenelle-Furfooz Men were a distinct racial type to the dolichocephalic (long-headed) Cro- Magnons and prognathic Grimaldi Man. However, the cranial index of the Grenelle and Furfooz skulls were different, as one of the Furfooz crania was not broad, but mesocephalic. Paul Broca (1877) thus proposed that the mesocephalic crania of the Upper Paleolithic was the result of admixture between the long-headed Cro-Magnons and the broad-headed Furfooz race. Giuseppe Sergi in his work The Mediterranean Race (1901), however, rejected this view (p. 192) but it was generally agreed that the crania at Grenelle and Furfooz were ancestral to the broad-headed Alpine race.

From top to bottom: the Birkensee, the Lu√üsee and the Langwieder See. The Langwieder lake district (German: Langwieder Seenplatte) is composed of three lakes west of Munich in Bavaria, Germany. It opened in the year 2000 as a recreational area enclosing the Langwieder See, the Lu√üsee, and the Birkensee. The entire site spans ; 40 of which are the lakes and 80 are land; of which are lawns for sunbathing.  Langwieder See  Bathing section, Langwieder See The Langwieder See lies to the west of Munich by the A8 Autobahn to Stuttgart and was created by the excavation of gravel for motorway construction in the 1930s. It covers an area of approximately , is 8 metres deep at its deepest point, and has a shoreline of . It is the second largest standing body of water in Munich. Available activities include a miniature golf course and rowing boat rental. Diving is also permitted in the northeastern part of the lake. A former motorway service station was converted into a hotel and restaurant with a beer garden; also near the lake is a campsite. At the water's edge in the south is the rescue station belonging to the Munich Wasserwacht or water patrol, where a rapid response unit can be found. The station also provides assistance to the Lu√üsee and Birkensee.  Lu√üsee  Construction of the Lu√üsee (1999) Covering an area of approximately and with a shoreline of , the Lu√üsee lies between the Langwieder See and the Birkensee, and is immediately adjacent to the Langwieder See. Constructed between 1995 and 2000, it is 16 metres deep at its deepest point, and is one of the newest bathing lakes in north-west Munich. It originated as a gravel excavation pit for the construction of the Eschenried bypass, a small section of the A99 Autobahn, for which more than two million cubic metres of gravel were excavated. Southern and eastern areas of the lake were created as biotopes to compensate for the construction work, and there are also large areas of short grass next to it for sunbathing. In the north-east of the lake is a large pebble shore with a promenade and kiosk. To the east is the water patrol's boat house, situated where the Lu√üsee and Landwieder See are nearest to each other. The lake is notable for its crystal-clear water: in the year 2000 it was voted as the cleanest lake in Munich.  Birkensee  Birkensee in spring Approximately 200 metres north of the Lu√üsee is the Birkensee. Located in Bergkirchen in the Dachau district, this lake is also a result of gravel excavation in the 1930s. It covers an area of approximately , is six metres deep at its deepest point, and has a shoreline of .  Access  The lakes can be accessed directly from the A8 via the \\"M√ºnchen-Langwied\\" exit, and there is a 1,100-space car park in the west and a 700-space one in the south. During the bathing season, a bus service operates from Lochausen S-Bahn station, from which the distance is approximately .

As a three-year-old in 1934, he won both The Derby and the St Leger in record time. In 1935, he won the Coronation Cup and the Eclipse Stakes before his career was ended by injury. Background Windsor Lad was sired by the three-time Champion sire Blandford out of the 1926 Epsom Oaks runner-up Resplendent. He was described as \\"a good, hard bay, level of back, with a well-placed shoulder and broad hips\\" who possessed a \\"resolute and calm\\" temperament. As a yearling he was sent to the sales by his Irish breeder, Dan Sullivan, where he was sold for 1,300gns to the Indian Maharaja of Rajpipla. Windsor Lad was sent into training with Marcus Marsh at Newmarket, Suffolk and accompanied his trainer when he relocated to Lambourn after the 1933 season. Windsor Lad was ridden in most of his races by Charles \\"Charlie\\" Smirke, a controversial figure who was returning after being \\"warned off\\" (banned) for five years after he was suspected of \\"stopping\\" a horse. Racing career =1933: two-year-old season= Windsor Lad won two races as a juvenile including the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket in October, but was slow to mature and was not among the leaders of his generation. =1934: three-year-old season= In 1934, Windsor Lad emerged as a Derby candidate by winning two trial races, the Chester Vase on 8 May and the Newmarket Stakes. In The Derby he started at 15/2 joint second favourite, in a field of nineteen, with the undefeated 2000 Guineas winner Colombo starting favourite. The race was run of fast ground in front of a crowd estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000. Ridden by Charlie Smirke, Windsor Lad was second turning into the straight before taking the lead a furlong out. He was strongly challenged by Easton and Colombo but ran on strongly to win by a length and a neck. The winning time of 2:34.0 equalled the race record set by Hyperion the previous year. The Maharaja celebrated with a lavish party at the Savoy Hotel which featured a performing elephant arrayed in his purple and cream racing colours. Windsor Lad started favourite for his first race against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July. Smirke held the colt up but became \\"jammed against the rail\\" in the straight. By the time he had extricated the Derby winner, the race was effectively over and although Windsor Lad finished strongly he finished only third, beaten half a length and the same by the four-year-olds King Salmon and Umidwar. During the summer of 1934, there were proposals for special international race at either Saratoga Springs or Belmont Park between Windsor Lad, the American champion Cavalcade and the leading French colt Admiral Drake (Brant√¥me, probably the best three-year old of 1934 was a sick horse during the summer) but the plans did not come to fruition. After the Eclipse Stakes, Windsor Lad was sold for a sum of ¬£50,000 to the bookmaker Martin H. Benson. Windsor Lad won the Great Yorkshire Stakes and in the St Leger at Doncaster the colt returned to his best form. He started at odds of 4/9 with the connections of his rivals conceding that they had little prospect of upsetting the favourite. In front of a crowd estimated at a quarter of a million, Smirke tracked the leader before moving the colt in to the lead three furlongs from the finish. Windsor Lad was never challenged and won going away by two lengths from Tiberius in a record-equalling time of 3:01.6. As of 2012, the record remains unsurpassed. After the race he was described as \\"one of the finest horses the English turf has seen in many seasons.\\" =1935: four-year- old season= Windsor Lad was unbeaten as a four-year-old. After winning the Burwell Stakes he faced Easton in the Coronation Cup at Epsom. The race was much anticipated, and was seen as being a match between Easton's speed and Windsor Lad's stamina. Windsor Lad prevailed in the race, beating Easton by a length and a half. He won the Rous Memorial Stakes over seven and a half furlongs at Royal Ascot and was then sent to Sandown for a second attempt at the Eclipse Stakes. In the Eclipse he started at odds of 4/7 and led from the start to win by three quarters of a length from Theft and Fair Trial. He broke down during the race and won what had already been announced as his last racecourse appearance despite sustaining an injury.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bZpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VaUMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1947,3168003&dq;=windsor- lad+eclipse-stakes&hl;=en Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Windsor Lad the nineteenth best horse of the 20th Century and the sixth best Derby winner, behind Sea Bird, Hyperion, Mill Reef, Nijinsky and Shergar.Randall, J. and Morris, T., A Century of Champions, Portway Press, Halifax, 1999, p. 80 Stud career Windsor Lad suffered from ill health during his stud career and made little impact as a stallion.

History The Rosedale Farmhouse was built in 1793 by Revolutionary War Colonel Uriah Forrest A small stone cottage constructed in 1740 was incorporated into the house, making Rosedale the oldest surviving house in what is now Washington, DC. The house is set in terraced grounds that are the last remnant of an estate that once encompassed all of what is now Cleveland Park. Rosedale was owned by Forrest descendants until 1920. In 1920, it was purchased by Queene Coonley, the widow of Avery Coonley, owner of Frank Lloyd Wright's Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois, who had rented the house beginning in 1917. The house was rented to Undersecretary of State William Phillips in 1933, and to John N. Irwin, II in 1959. It was a faculty residence for the National Cathedral School. In 1977, the youth exchange organization Youth For Understanding bought the premises. YFU sold Rosedale to The Rosedale Conservancy, a local trust, in 2002.

The title means portraits, and some of the songs of the album are portraits of historical figures. It was released in 2004 by EMI, was generally well received by critics and fans, and remained at the top of the Italian album chart for two weeks. Overview Ritratti (\\"portraits\\") was released on February 20, 2004, four years after Guccini's last studio album, Stagioni. It consists of nine songs, three of which are portraits of historical figures: \\"Odysseus\\" and \\"Cristoforo Columbo\\", in which Guccini focuses on the theme of travel through the voices of Ulysses and Columbus, and \\"Canzone per il Che\\", the second Guccini's song in honour of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara after \\"Stagioni\\", included in the album of the same name. \\"Piazza Alimonda\\" is about the demonstrations at the 2001 G8 Summit in Genoa and the death of Carlo Giuliani during the riots. There are several literary references throughout the album,especially in \\"Odysseus\\", which references the Odyssey, the Canto 26 of Dante's Inferno, and \\"A Zacinto\\", a poem by Foscolo. \\"La ziatta\\" was translated in the dialect of Modena by Guccini from \\"La tieta\\" by Joan Manuel Serrat, while \\"La tua libert√†\\" was a song first written in 1971 but never recorded before. Reception The album was generally well received by critics. The Italian music website Ondarock gave it a 6.5 mark, saying Ritratti was not outstanding for its music but for its lyrics, which \\"face current affairs both seriously and lightly\\". The two major Italian newspapers also praised the album; the Corriere della Sera said it contained songs which are still necessary, and the fact that Guccini didn't change his style was \\"a piece of luck\\", while La Repubblica described the album as an \\"earthquake of sharp words\\". The website Rockol.it, in its review, criticised the album, saying it was \\"old, anachronistic, with songs full of obsolete images\\". Ritratti was a commercial success: it reached the number one spot in the FIMI Albums Chart, and held it for two weeks, from February 26 to March 11. It remained in the Top 20 chart for eight weeks.

It was heard in the Appellate Division by Centlivres CJ, Schreiner JA, Van Den Heever JA, Hoexter JA and Fagan JA on June 13, 1955, with judgment handed down on June 20. It was an appeal from a decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division, which it upheld.  Facts  In June 1953, a document was signed, on behalf of Delmas Milling, by JF du Plessis in confirmation. It read as follows: > We beg to confirm the purchase of, 2,750/3,250 Bags > New Season Kidney Beans As Inspected On Farm Strydpan > Price Eighty shillings 80/ - Per Bag Of > Terms 200 lbs. Nett Delivered. > Delivered in good order and condition at Delmas Milling Co. > Mills At Delmas. > For Delivery Up To The 10/7/53. > Failing delivery within the prescribed time the above > price is subject to adjustment. > All deliveries must be in accordance with Grades > specified above. > Please note that all conditions mentioned herein > must be strictly adhered to. > Payment On Delivery > At Mill.Quoted at 450C-F. The sections italicised were in writing; the remainder of the document was printed. In a declaration claiming damages for an alleged breach of contract, Delmas contended that it had, at Du Plessis's request, extended the date of delivery to July 20, 1953, and that Du Plessis, after delivering 1,000 bags of beans, had then refused to deliver the remaining 1,750. The damages claimed were in respect of this balance; the alleged breach was Du Plessis's failure to perform within the prescribed time. Du Plessis pleaded that, having delivered 1,000 bags before the stipulated date, he was contractually only obliged to deliver the balance when the contract price had been adjusted, and that Delmas had refused to agree on a mutual adjustment. Delmas excepted to this plea and applied to strike out certain portions of it. The disputed clause was the sentence which begins \\"Failing delivery...\\" The Provincial Division dismissed both the exception and the application to strike out.  Findings  Centlivres heldVan Den Heever concurring. that the effect of the disputed clause was to make the contract an option to sell. If the contract was to be construed as one of purchase and sale, the clause must have been inserted for the benefit of the respondent, in which case he could not be said to be taking advantage of his own wrong (in failing to deliver by the stipulated date) when he relied on the clause. The court held further that, as there was no ambiguity in the meaning of the disputed clause, evidence of surrounding circumstances could not affect that meaning. Schreiner foundHoexter and Fagan concurring. that the word \\"purchase\\" was inconsistent with a mere option to sell, and held that, when there is a serious difficulty in interpreting a contract, and the court is not obliged to decide the matter on exception, it should not do so. Hoexter heldSchreiner and Fagan concurring that the exception to the plea had rightly been dismissed on the grounds that the contract could be construed as a mere option to sell, not on the grounds that it was incapable of any other meaning. The decision in the Provincial Division was thus confirmed.  Interpretation  \\"It is apparently an abiding problem,\\" noted Schreiner, > to determine where the line is to be drawn between difficulties in the > interpretation of a written contract that can and must be solved by > linguistic construction only and difficulties which it is permissible to > clear away by consideration of surrounding circumstances, as distinguished > from facts merely required to identify persons and things mentioned in the > contract.453H-454A. Delmas Milling v Du Plessis is most often cited as precedent in the area of contractual interpretation, with Schreiner's stipulation that there \\"appear to be three broad classes of evidence\\" to be used when documents fall to be interpreted:454E. # Where, although there be difficulty in interpretation, \\"perhaps serious difficulty,\\" it can nevertheless be cleared up by linguistic treatment, this must be done: \\"The only permissible additional evidence in such cases is of an identificatory nature; such evidence is really not used for interpretation but only to apply the contract to the facts. Such application may, of course, be itself the cause of the difficulty, giving rise to what is sometimes called a latent ambiguity.\\"454F-G. # If the difficulty cannot be cleared up with sufficient certainty by studying the language, recourse may be had to \\"surrounding circumstances\\"‚Äîmatters probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted (but not actual negotiations and similar statements): \\"It is commonly said that the Court is entitled to be informed of all such circumstances in all cases [...]. But this does not mean that if sufficient certainty as to the meaning can be gathered from the language alone it is nevertheless permissible to reach a different result by drawing inferences from the surrounding circumstances. Whether there is sufficient certainty in the language of even very badly drafted contracts to make it unnecessary and therefore wrong to draw inferences from the surrounding circumstances is a matter of individual judicial opinion on each case.\\" # The third and final class is where even the use of surrounding circumstances does not provide \\"sufficient certainty.\\" These are cases of ambiguity in the narrow sense: After surrounding circumstances have been considered, there is still no substantial balance in favour of one meaning over another. Recourse may then be had to what passed between the parties on the subject of the contract. The court should use outside evidence as conservatively as possible - but use it, it must if necessary to reach what seems to be a sufficient degree of certainty as to the right meaning.

He was nominated to the Supreme Court of the Confederate States of America by President Jefferson Davis, but the court never sat because of the American Civil War. After the war, he served as the Dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School from 1874 to 1875. He was a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1878 to 1886. Early life Cooper was born on March 11, 1820 in Franklin, Tennessee. His father, Matthew D. Cooper, was a merchant who later became a banker in Columbia, Tennessee. His mother was Mary Agnes Frierson. His paternal grandfather, Robert Cooper, served in the American Revolutionary War. He had three brothers, including Senator Henry Cooper, and two half-brothers, including Duncan Brown Cooper. He grew up in Columbia, Tennessee, where he was raised as a Presbyterian. He wintered in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1832, and learned to speak French. Cooper graduated from Yale College in 1838. While he was at Yale, one of his professors was Alphonso Taft. Following college, he returned home to Columbia and began the study of medicine. After two years' study in Tennessee, he went to Philadelphia, where he attended medical lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, then abandoned the medical field for law. He joined the law offices of his uncle, Chancellor Samuel Davies Frierson, in Maury County, Tennessee. He was admitted to the bar in 1841. Career Cooper was the manager of his family Mulberry Hill Plantation in Maury County, Tennessee from 1840 to 1845. Meanwhile, he also practised the law alongside Samuel Davies Frierson. From 1845 to 1846, he formed a law firm with Alfred Osborne Pope Nicolson. From 1846 to 1851, he practised the law on his own. In 1851-1852, with Return J. Meigs III, Cooper were appointed to codify the laws of Tennessee. They completed their project in 1858, and their work was adopted, almost without modification, as the state's official code. Cooper was initially reluctant to embrace secession, but he fully supported the Confederate States of America (CSA) once it was established. Meanwhile, he was nominated to the Supreme Court of the CSA by President Jefferson Davis, but the court never came to fruition. Meanwhile, he traveled in Europe. Cooper resumed legal practice in Nashville after the war. He served as the Dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School from 1874 to 1875, when he was succeeded by Thomas H. Malone. He was elected again to the Tennessee Supreme Court in August 1878 and served on the court until 1886. In 1890 he was awarded honorary degrees by Yale University, the University of Tennessee, and the University of Nashville. Riverwood. Personal life Cooper never married. He resided at Riverview in East Nashville until he purchased Riverwood, another mansion in Nashville, in 1859. He renamed the property Riverwood because of its location on bluffs on the north side of the Cumberland River. Death and legacy Cooper died on May 7, 1909 in Brooklyn, New York City. He was buried at the Zion Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Ashwood, Tennessee. Upon his death, Riverwood passed to his half-brother, Duncan Brown Cooper.

He was born in 1844 in Berwick, Northumberland to Thomas Paxton and Mary Louisa Pease. Little is known of his earliest days in Australia, but he arrived in Mackay in 1874 as assistant to Robert Jonathan Jeffray of Wm. Sloan and Co., a Melbourne merchant house. In 1876, he took over the store of sugar grower Arthur Kemmis and expanded the business as merchant and shipping agent, with close links to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company. A notable employee from 1881 was James Croker (23 April 1851 ‚Äì 27 April 1927), who later formed his own business shipping virtually all of the sugar from Mackay.Mackay Notes Townsville Daily Bulletin 1 April 1927 p. 5 accessed 1 November 2011 Around 1885, E. V. Reid joined as partner of Paxton & Co. They opened offices in Brisbane and Sydney. Their business flourished until being taken over by McIlwraith & McEachran, which later merged with Adelaide Steamship Company. The imposing company warehouse still exists on the waterfront and is a tourist drawcard. Jabberwock and Borough Belle One source, difficult to substantiate, asserts that Paxton owned two ships, the steam schooners Jabberwock and Borough Belle (under captains Hugh Adrian and Robert J. Belbin) which were engaged in the labour recruiting business, now reviled as \\"blackbirding\\". :Jabberwock, an auxiliary steam screw three-masted schooner, of 87 tons register, was built by D. Macquarie at Millers Point in 1875. She immediately began carrying freight and passengers between Sydney, Brisbane Townsville, Cooktown and Maryborough with Moodie and Monro the Sydney agents and Quinlan & Co. in Brisbane. Her master in 1876 was G. Stable and was put up at auction in 1876, but may not have changed hands. In 1878 it was back on the market She was later advertised for sale as \\"specially suited for the South Sea Island labor trade\\" but continued carrying freight along the east coast. Her next master was A. White and John M. Brydon the Brisbane agent. In 1880 she collided with a river steamer \\"Redbank\\" in the Brisbane River; captain White was found partly culpable. She was fitted with berths that same year and (having previously been converted to steam operation) the S.S. Jabberwock began the Islander labour trade by returning labourers who had completed their contract. Also similar advertisement for the \\"Lady Darling\\" The trade was not trouble- free. The Jabberwock boats were fired on by residents of Tanna, and almost the entire crew of another ship, the \\"Borealis\\" were massacred at Malayta. With rising demand for labour from Fiji and Samoa as well as Queensland, and a growing realisation of the true nature of the contracts, the thirty-odd ships engaged in the trade were returning half full.

Reading produced a Pennsylvania Dutch Lager at a volume of 1,200 barrels a year. The brewery raised its production to approximately 50,000 barrels a year by 1891. Reading suffered from difficulties after Prohibition began in 1920. From 1928 to 1933, the brewery was closed down. The facility itself was almost dismantled, but U.S. Marshals had trouble breaking the padlock on the front door and eventually left the plant intact. After considerable litigation, Reading brewery reopened in 1934. From 1934 to 1951 Reading ran a 'retro' advertising campaign which played on the nostalgia for simpler times. In 1958, due to flagging sales, Reading re-branded as \\"The Friendly Beer for Modern People.\\" The change proved successful in reversing the slump and Reading made strong sales that lasted into the 1970s. In 1976, Reading ceased operations due to increasing pressure from larger macro brewers. The label was purchased shortly afterwards by C. Schmidt & Sons. The brand changed hands several times until 1999, when it was again retired. In 2006, the Label was revived by Legacy Brewing, which produced original Reading recipes.

Astron used a unique confinement system that avoided several of the problems found in contemporary designs like the stellarator and magnetic mirror. Development was greatly slowed by a series of changes to the design that were made with limited oversight, leading to a review committee being set up to oversee further development. The Astron was unable to meet the performance goals set for it by the committee; funding was cancelled in 1972 and development wound down in 1973. Work on similar designs appears to have demonstrated a theoretical problem in the very design that suggests it could never be used for practical generation. History =Strong focusing= Christofilos is best known for independently inventing the concept of strong focusing, a feature used in particle accelerators. He had first started work along these lines in the late 1940s while running an elevator installation company, and in 1948 he wrote a letter to what was then the University of California's Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley outlining several ideas on accelerator focusing. When they returned his letter pointing out several problems, he solved these and wrote them again. This second letter was ignored. In 1950 Christofilos filed a patent application, which was granted in 1956 as US Patent 2,736,799. Around the same time, Ernest Courant, Milton Stanley Livingston, and Hartland Snyder of Brookhaven National Laboratory were considering the same problem and devised the same solution, writing about it in the 1 December 1952 issue of Physical Review.Ernest Courant, M. Stanley Livingston and Hartland Snyder. \\"The Strong-Focusing Synchrotron‚ÄîA New High Energy Accelerator\\", Physical Review Volume 88 (1952). p. 1190. When he saw the paper, Christofilos arranged a trip to the US, arriving two months later. Making his way to Brookhaven, he angrily accused them of stealing the idea from his patent. He also met with members of the Atomic Energy Commission, and after meeting with his attorneys, they paid him $10,000 for the patent. =Astron proposal= With the patent purchase came some fame and enough money that Christofilos was able to enter the US physics world. In April 1953 he attended a meeting of Project Sherwood, and presented another idea he had been working on in Greece, the Astron. The basic idea was to inject high-energy electrons into a magnetic mirror (the \\"tank\\"). The electrons would be captured in the mirror, and build up a layer of current near the outside surface of the tank volume, which he called the \\"E-layer\\". The E-layer would itself produce a powerful magnetic field as it built up, and once the current reached a critical density, the fields would \\"reverse\\", and fold into a new configuration of closed lines that formed a continuous confinement area. Once the E-layer had successfully formed, fusion fuel would be injected into the area inside it, and heated by interactions with the E-layer to bring it to fusion temperatures. This arrangement solved one of the main problems with the basic magnetic mirror concept, which had open field lines at the ends. Fuel could follow these lines right out of the reactor. Mirrors thus naturally leaked plasma, although designers believed they could address this problem by operating the machines at very high temperatures. In practice the leakage proved to be even higher than basic theory suggested, and never operated at the levels they hoped to achieve. At the time, Sherwood was still secret, which presented problems when he first outlined the concept. Prior to his taking the stage, the formulas from the previous session on the blackboard had been carefully erased. As he filled the blackboard with his own equations, someone helpfully showed him the buttons that would raise it and reveal a fresh one underneath. This one had not been erased and led to a rushed effort to prevent any sensitive material leaking. Looking to avoid a repeat event, Christofilos was given a job at Brookhaven, where he could continue working on the Astron theory. =Astron testing= In 1956, Christofilos finally received his security clearance, and he immediately moved to what was now the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to start work on the Astron concept. After two years enough progress had been made that he was able to present the idea at the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva, along with a model of the system they proposed to build. This consisted of two main parts, the magnetic bottle where the plasma would be held, and a particle accelerator that provided the relativistic electrons. In spite of his success, Christofilos was always an outsider at the lab. Time reported that \\"He still has no degree in physics, and his Greek accent, Greek volubility and love of passionate argument keep him an outsider.\\" This led to friction within the physics establishment, and early calls for termination of the Astron program. A 1963 review of the entire Project Sherwood effort led to formal calls for cancellation. However, the program had backers within the management of the controlled fusion program, notably Glenn Seaborg and John S. Foster, both with strong ties to LLNL. Foster, in particular, was concerned about groups in Washington dictating development to the labs. After considerable argument, it was decided that the program would be allowed to continue, but would need to demonstrate field reversal by 1965. By 1963 the team had designed and built a new type of linear induction accelerator with the required properties. The accelerator design led to interest as a particle beam weapon studied under Project Seesaw. However, during construction the team realized that the electrons were free to travel back into the accelerator area. Christofilos solved this by introducing resistor wires that slightly slowed the electrons after entering the tank, so they no longer possessed the energy needed to flow back out. After some work ironing out bugs, the first results were published in June 1964. The accelerator worked, operating at 4 MeV and 120 amps, and a stable E-layer was confirmed, albeit generating only 2 A/cm of current, just 0.05% of the diamagnetic field required to reverse the field. Work continued to meet the 1965 goal of reversal, but ultimately failed. However, the electron layer was stable, so the Herb-Allison committee recommended it continue to the next milepost. By 1967 this had been improved to 6%, but was still a long way from the stable E-layer the device needed to achieve. In 1968, Christofilos and T. Kenneth Fowler wrote a report asking for a more powerful accelerator, and upgrades to the tank. =Scrutiny= Funds for the upgrades were eventually granted, but only at the cost of direct oversight by an Ad Hoc Panel created by the AEC. By this point the \\"conventional\\" designs, the stellarator and magnetic mirror, had long been working on real-world plasmas and were slowly increasing the pressures and temperatures. Astron, on the other hand, was still a long way from building its first useful E-layer, a prerequisite for plasma experiments. The Ad Hoc Panel returned a negative report, complaining that far too much effort had been put into operational issues like accelerator performance, with little or no effort into theoretical studies on whether or not the plasma would ever be stable even if an E-layer could be formed. Moreover, the panel pointed out that no one had seriously studied whether or not an operating and stable Astron would require more power to operate than it would release. This was a serious concern in Astron, because its relativistic electrons would radiate away large amounts of power due to electron synchrotron radiation. Christofilos had already considered this and suggested that an operational design would use protons in place of the electrons, and would not suffer from the same level of energy losses. However, no such accelerator existed at the time, and the panel was highly skeptical that it would be simple to build. =Upgrade= The upgrades to Astron went ahead and started operation in 1969. During this period, following the advice of the Panel, the theoretical divisions at LLNL started taking a much more serious look at the concept. Building computer models of the system, they first attacked the problem of \\"stacking\\", that individual pulses of electrons from the accelerator did not build up in the E-layer as expected. Bruce Langdon demonstrated that stacking simply would not work. However, a suggestion by Fowler proved to save the Astron from this problem. He had noted that adding a second magnetic field running down the centre of the tank would reduce the amount of external field needed to create the E-layer. Christofilos went ahead with this change and started testing in 1971; this demonstrated greatly improved performance both with the reduction in current and success in trapping the electrons. This also allowed two pulses to be stacked, raising the field to 15% diamagnetic strength. While Aston worked towards multiple pulses, a team at Cornell University had been working on a similar design. However, this Relativistic Electron Coil Experiment (RECE) used a single long pulse of electrons rather than the stacking concept. Late in 1971 they announced they had achieved complete field reversal. Christofilos was unimpressed; this design would not be useful for a steady state fusion generator, only by continually adding pulses could the machine maintain itself. =Cancellation= Faced with the continued problems with Astron, and the seeming ease that the RECE team had managed to reach the goals they had originally suggested in 1968, a second Ad Hoc Panel published a scathing report. Among the problems they noted that the Astron team had been looking \\"for ingenious ways to avoid or circumvent difficulties rather than to understand them.\\" Roy Gould, head of the AEC's controlled fusion program, was specific in allowing the Astron project to continue, but only if it met a series of goals on a specific timeline. When Robert Hirsch took over the AEC's controlled fusion arm in 1972, he instituted a sweeping review to classify the approaches under study and eliminate duplication and low-payoff projects. Given the exciting results with the tokamak released in 1968, Hirsch favoured a program with relatively few projects each given much larger budgets. Many programs like Astron simply didn't appear to have any near-term payoff, and Hirsch was keen to cancel them. On 24 September 1972, Christofilos met with James Schlesinger of the AEC, but no record of the meeting remains. After a long day, he went to a local Holiday Inn to save a long commute home. That night he suffered a massive heart attack and died. Richard Briggs took over direction of the project until its planned shutdown date in June 1973. Under his direction, Astron returned to study of the new stabilizing field introduced by Fowler, and using single larger pulses the device hit 50% diamagnetic strength, much greater than Christofilos' efforts with pulse chains. Their final report stated that \\"buildup of the E-layer by multiple- pulse injection was generally unsuccessful\\" and noted that at the time of the shutdown they still did not understand what physics problem was limiting the buildup. =After Astron= Although Astron shut down, work continued with RECE at Cornell for some time. As part of their work, the team attempted to make the switch from electrons to protons. However, as some suspected, the \\"P-layer\\" proved difficult to build, and field reversal with protons was never achieved. The last version of this effort, FIREX, shut down in 2003, having demonstrated what appears to be a purely theoretical reason why the Astron concept will never work. The relativistic electron ring also played a part in the bumpy torus design. This was another attempt to \\"plug the ends\\" of mirrors, by linking a number of mirrors end-to-end to form a torus. Electrons were driven to high energies not through direct injection, but external microwave-driven electron-cyclotron heating (ECH).Jim Cobble, \\"The Microwave- Driven Bumpy Torus Experiment\\", Los Alamos National Laboratory, 18 August 2011 Description The Astron device consisted of two sections, the linear accelerator and the magnetic mirror \\"tank\\". These were constructed at right angles, with the accelerator's output firing into the side of the tank at one end. The tank was a relatively simple example of the magnetic mirror concept, consisting largely of a long solenoid with additional windings at both ends to increase the magnetic field in those regions and form the mirror. In a simple mirror the ions in the fuel plasma were injected at an angle so they could not simply flow right out of the ends where the field was roughly linear. However, there was an annular region on either end where ions of the right energy could escape, and various calculations demonstrated the rate would be fairly high. By injecting electrons into the mirror before the fuel, the E-layer would create a second magnetic field that would cause the annular areas to fold back into the center of the tank. The resulting field was shaped like a tube, and very similar to the Field-Reversed Configuration, or FRC. The main difference between these devices is the way the field reversal is achieved; with the E-layer in the Astron, and by currents in the plasma for the FRC. Like the classic mirror, Astron injected the electrons into the mirror at a slight angle to ensure they would circulate into the center of the mirror. Today, the Astron is often considered a sub-class of the FRC concept.Cornelis Marius Braams, Peter Stott, \\"Nuclear fusion: half a century of magnetic confinement fusion research\\", CRC Press, 2002, p. 106 See also *List of plasma (physics) articles References =Citations= =Bibliography= * * Category:Fusion reactors Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ","title":"Astron (fusion reactor)"},{"id":"33596367","text":"Ruby Cohn (born Ruby Burman; August 13, 1922 - October 18, 2011) was an American theater scholar and a leading authority on playwright Samuel Beckett.

History The Moderne building, was designed by John Stokes Redden and John G. Raben in 1941. Tenleytown was transformed on October 2, 1941 when Sears Roebuck opened its department store on Wisconsin Avenue at Albemarle Street. At the time the store was notable for its size, and for its 300 car rooftop parking lot. In 1975, the Wisconsin Avenue elevation was altered for the Tenleytown‚ÄìAU (WMATA station). In the 1990s, Sears abandoned its retail operation at the location, and the building was used by Hechinger hardware until its demise in the late 1990s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places, on February 16, 1996. It was the location of the second Art-O-Matic, from September 29 to October 28, 2000. In the 2000s, the building was converted to a mixed-use development complex called Cityline at Tenley, with luxury condos (The Cityline) on the top levels, a Best Buy and a Container Store at street level, and an Ace Hardware underground, located within the parking garage that serves the aforementioned stores.

He also wrote Absence of Malice (1981), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, as well as Random Hearts (1999). All three films were directed by Sydney Pollack. Early life Luedtke was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on September 28, 1939. His father, Herman, worked as a lumber broker; his mother was named Virginia. He obtained a bachelor's degree from Brown University, then joined the fast-track summer law program at the University of Michigan Law School. However, he switched career paths after traveling to the Southern United States to observe the unfolding civil rights movement and penned several articles on the subject as a freelancer. He then studied at the Medill School of Journalism of Northwestern University. Career Luedtke became a newspaper reporter, first in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then at the Miami Herald. Luedtke moved to the Detroit Free Press in 1965. He started off as general assignment reporter, then rose to executive editor at age 33. Luedtke left the Free Press and quit journalism altogether in 1978. He moved to Hollywood to break into the film business, where his only entry was as a screenwriter. His intention was to write a book, but his idea for a book about reporting came to the attention of Orion Pictures, which optioned it before it was written for $20,000 and pitched it to director George Roy Hill, who liked it but was unavailable to help on the screenplay. Luedtke offered to write the screenplay for free providing that he could have his idea back if Orion didn't proceed with the movie. Ultimately, Sydney Pollack was available to direct the movie, which became Absence of Malice, beginning the working relationship between the two men. Luedtke received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a rare accomplishment for a first-time screenwriter. He again collaborated with Pollack in Out of Africa (1985). The film won seven Oscars (from 11 nominations), including Luedtke's award for Best Adapted Screenplay. His final partnership with Pollack came in Random Hearts, released in 1999. Personal life Luedtke was married to Eleanor for 55 years until his death. The two met while they were working at the Miami Herald. He recovered from cancer on two occasions. On August 9, 2020, Luedtke died from multiple organ failure at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, at the age of 80.

It was constructed for the sum of $7,000 by contractors Hill and Conley and designed in an Italianate style by architect John Teague. The home's rambling, two-story symmetry; overhanging eaves with decorative brackets; narrow bay windows; and low-pitched, gabled roof are all features typical of this fanciful late 19th century style. Fairholme was built for John Chapman Davie, a prominent doctor and surgeon who is known today as an early promoter of Sir Joseph Lister's antiseptic surgical methods. In addition to introducing the surgical practice to British Columbia, he was also largely responsible for the design of the first operating room at the Royal Jubilee Hospital. Davie lived at Fairholme with his wife, Sara Holmes Todd, and his 3 children from a previous marriage. Sara Holmes Todd succumbed to pneumonia in 1894; Davie died in 1911.

Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality. They see each other as only loosely linked, and value personal goals over group interests. Individualistic cultures tend to have a more diverse population and are characterized with emphasis on personal achievements, and a rational assessment of both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of relationships with others. Individualistic cultures have such unique aspects of communication as being a low power-distance culture and having a low-context communication style. The United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany and South Africa have been identified as highly individualistic cultures. The term individualistic culture was founded by Geert Hofstede in 1980. According to Hofstede, Individualistic culture refers to a sociological and not a psychological dimension. In a detailed analysis of 40 national cultures, he stated that cultures can be identified as individualistic or collectivistic. Collectivistic cultures value the whole group or community rather than the individual . This idea, however, just defines and characterizes different societies and is not a description of different personalities . Knowing what cultures values are helps sociologist understand the human behavior of people from different cultures. There has been a global increase in individualism in the recent years and individualistic culture is on the raise in many countries around the world . Low power distance Power distance is defined to be the degree to which unequal distribution of power is accepted in a culture. Low power distance cultures challenge authority, encourage a reduction of power differences between management and employees, and encourage the use of power legitimately. Low power distance is more likely to occur in an individualistic culture, because in a collectivist culture, people protect the well being of the group and established order so they would be less likely to challenge authority or people in power. Even though individualistic cultures are more likely to be low power distance, these cultures don't expect to completely eliminate power difference. People within this low power distance culture, however, are more likely to respond to such imbalances in power with more negative emotional responses than in the alternative, high power distance cultures. Low power distance cultures include Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Sweden. The U.S. ranks 38th on the scale. Low-context communication style Communication among people of different cultural groups can sometimes be challenging, as they might have practices and social cues that maybe be different from your own. This can often lead to miscommunication. The concept of low context communication was first introduced by anthropologist Edward T Hall. Hall's concepts of low context and high context communication explains differences in communication and culture in which context is needed to achieve understanding and avoid miscommunication . Individualistic cultures are also more likely to have a low-context communication style. This means that communication is precise, direct, and specific. Unlike in high-context communication, reading between the lines is not necessary in low-context communication. This explicit communication is used in order to prevent any form of misunderstanding between cultures. The ability to articulate the thoughts and opinions one holds as well as to express them eloquently are encouraged, as is persuasive speaking. Low-context communication is all content and no relationship dimension.  Emotion display and display rules  Individualistic cultures tend to prioritize the individual person over the group, and this can be seen in how the display rules vary from a collectivist culture compared to an individualistic culture. Display rules are the rules that exist in different cultures that determine how emotion should be displayed publicly. In an individualistic culture, self-expression is highly valued, making the display rules less strict and allowing people to display intense emotion such as: happiness, anger, love, etc. While in a collectivist culture, moderation and self-control is highly valued for the well being of the group, and collectivist cultures therefore tend to restrain from showing emotion in public.  Marriage and Family Dynamics  In 1994 Ruth Chao, argued that ‚Äúparenting styles developed on North American samples cannot be simply translated to other cultures, but instead must reflect their sociocultural contexts‚Äù . Many cultures have different styles of parenting and the dynamics those families are also different. People from individualistic cultures usually look out for themselves and their immediate family only . While people from collectivistic cultures look out for their community or group, as well as their family. Harald Wallbott and Klaus Scherer suggest that in cultures that are collectivist and high in power parents use real shame in their parenting styles. Whereas in individualistic cultures that are low in power, and are uncertainty-avoidance, shame more closely resembles guilt in their parent style. For example, in Asian collectivistic cultures shame is a highly valued emotional response. So much so, that in Japan, which is considered to be a collectivistic culture, many people commit suicide after dishonoring or bringing shame to their family or community. = Work-Family Balance = One‚Äôs cultural style can also interfere with work-family relationship dynamics between different cultures. In Shan Xu research he found that, employees from more individualistic cultures are more sensitive to how their work interferes with their family life . These employees are more concerned about their own individual family dynamics and structure. While people from more collectivistic cultures are more concerned about how their work provides material, social, and cognitive resources such as intelligence and experience which will help their families. These employees are more focused on the overall and harmony of all those little factors and how they affect their families.  Conflict strategies  Conflict strategies are methods used to resolve different problems. There are different approaches to resolving conflict, and depending the culture a person is brought up in, the more likely it is for them to use a certain approach. Since individualistic culture sets greater value to personal achievement, contrary to collectivist cultures who value harmony, it is more likely for a person from an individualistic culture to use competition as their method of resolving conflict. When using competition as an approach to resolving conflict, a person is more confrontational and seeks to achieve his or her own goals with no regard of the goals of others. Using this approach a person seeks domination, which means to get others to do what the person wants instead of what they initially wanted. On the contrary, a collectivist culture would more likely use a less confrontational approach such as accommodation to end the conflict with compromise so that each party is benefited.  Collectivism  Individualistic cultures focus on the ‚ÄúI‚Äù consciousness while the collectivistic cultures have a greater emphasis on the ‚ÄúWe‚Äù consciousness . According to the Key Concepts in Developmental Psychology individualism and collectivism have multiple factors which contribute to whether a culture is considered individualistic or collectivistic . Things such as the national wealth of the county, indices of modernity, the freedom of press, and even the frequency of traffic deaths. All of these play a roll in whether a county identifies as individualistic or collectivistic.

Most of the small-scale farms in the Big Bend area quickly fell into ruin after the park was established in 1944. Larger-scale ranch structures survived in greater numbers, but the small-scale irrigated bottomland farms have not. The farm is located next to the Rio Grande. History The original landowner was Jesus Estrada, who sold the land to John O. Wedlin, a Swedish immigrant. Wedlin, who had farmed wheat in Kansas, leveled the fields, installing a pump-powered irrigation system, establishing one of the first such farms in the area. Wedlin also built the house now known as the Daniels Farm House as a storage shed for farm equipment. Wedlin lived about a mile away, raising wheat for eight years. He sold the farm to cattleman Joe H. Graham of Del Rio, Texas in 1926. Graham, who owned the Lou Buttrill Ranch in the northern Big Bend, used the grain from the Daniels operation to feed his cattle, turning them out in the fields in winter. The Grahams expanded the operation, but sold the northern of the property to John R. Daniels and Mary Coe Daniels of Presidio in 1937. The Daniels moved into the former storage shed, using it as their residence and adding a room to house a small store that catered to local residents in the Boquillas community. Daniels converted about to cotton. When the park was established in 1944, the Daniels moved away. Description The house is a two-room adobe building, about by . The house was roofed with cane latillas over aspen log vigas in a style traditional to the area. Th house's surroundings retain traces of the irrigated farm environment and possess good historical integrity. A small portion of the Daniels Farm comprising the house and its immediate surroundings is incorporated in the National Register of Historic Places listing, established on October 20, 1989.

This was the main axis along which the town developed, between the church and the market place. It exhibits buildings from many historical periods. Penkridge is a market town and parish in Staffordshire with a history stretching back to the Anglo-Saxon period. A religious as well as a commercial centre, it was originally centred on the Collegiate Church of St. Michael and All Angels, a chapel royal and royal peculiar that maintained its independence until the Reformation. Mentioned in Domesday, Penkridge underwent a period of growth from the 13th century, as the Forest Law was loosened, and evolved into a patchwork of manors of greatly varying size and importance, heavily dependent on agriculture. From the 16th century it was increasingly dominated by a single landed gentry family, the Littletons, who ultimately attained the Peerage of the United Kingdom as the Barons Hatherton, and who helped modernise its agriculture and education system. The Industrial Revolution inaugurated a steady improvement in transport and communications that helped shape the modern town. In the second half of the 20th century, Penkridge grew rapidly, evolving into a mainly residential area, while retaining its commercial centre, its links with the countryside and its fine church. Early settlement Early human occupation of the immediate area around Penkridge has been confirmed by the presence of a Bronze or Iron Age barrow at nearby Rowley Hill.Victoria County History of Staffordshire, pp.192-3, 376 A significant settlement in this vicinity has existed since pre-Roman times, with its original location being at the intersection of the River Penk and what became the Roman military road known as Watling Street (today's A5 trunk road). This would place it between Water Eaton and Gailey, about SSW of the modern town. Anglo-Saxon origins King Edgar the Peaceful (959-975), who described Penkridge as a \\"famous place\\" in an important charter issued there. Detail of stained glass window, All Souls College Chapel, Oxford. The town of Penkridge in its current location dates back at least to the early Middle Ages, when the area was part of Mercia, and it held an important place in local society, trade, and religious observance. The first clear reference to the settlement of Pencric comes from the reign of Edgar the Peaceful (959-975), who issued a royal charter from it in 958, describing it as a \\"famous place\\".The Electronic Sawyer: Online Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon Charters, S667 Edgar says he is in loco famoso qui dicitur Pencric. Around 1000, Wulfgeat, a Shropshire landowner, left bullocks to the church at Penkridge, which means that the church must date from at least the 10th century. In the 16th century, John Alen, dean of Penkridge and Archbishop of Dublin, claimed that the founder of the collegiate church of St. Michael at Penkridge was King Eadred (946-55), Edgar's uncle, which seems plausible.Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 3, 34: The College of St. Michael, Penkridge. The origins of the settlement may go back much earlier in the Anglo-Saxon period, but the known dates suggest that it achieved considerable importance in the mid-10th century and that the town's significance was in large part dependent on its important church. A local legend claims that King Edgar made Penkridge his capital for three years whilst he was reconquering the Danelaw. However most historical sources see the reign of Edgar as an uneventful one, as his cognomen suggests, and there is no record of any internal strife between English and Danes during his reign, making this claim doubtful. At Domesday, more than a century later, Penkridge was still a royal manor, and St. Michael's was a chapel royal. This makes it likely that Edgar stayed here simply because it was one of his homes: medieval rulers were itinerant, moving with their retinue to consume their resources in situ, rather than having them transported to a capital. In about 1086, Domesday not only recorded the then situation at Penkridge, but gave considerable insight into changes and continuities since the Anglo-Saxon period. Penkridge was still held by the king, William the Conqueror, directly, not simply as overlord of another magnate - just as Edward the Confessor held it before the Norman Conquest. The king had a mill and a substantial area of woodland. The numbers working on the king's land are, however, very small: just two slaves, two villeins and two smallholders, although the land at Penkridge was worth 40 shillings annually. Then there were the subsidiary parts of the manor: Wolgarston, Drayton, Congreve, Dunston, Cowley and Beffcote, which had almost 30 workers and had increased in value from 65s. to 100s. since the Conquest ‚Äì unusual in the Midlands or North at that time. At Penkridge itself a substantial part of the agricultural land was held from the king by nine clerics, who had a hide of land, worked by six slaves and seven villeins. These clerics had a further 2¬æ hides at Gnosall, to the north, with twelve workers. Both these holdings had risen greatly in value since the Conquest. In Henry I's time, there was a dispute between the Abbey of Saint- Remi or Saint-R√©my at Reims in Northern France, which claimed the church at Lapley, next to its daughter house, Lapley Priory, and a royal chaplain. It is believed the clerk in question was a canon of Penkridge, trying to vindicate an ancient claim to Lapley.Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 3, 34: The College of St. Michael, Penkridge, footnote 5. A 13th-century source confirms that Lapley once belonged to Penkridge. The court found in favour of Saint-R√©my and Lapley was confirmed as a small independent parish in the advowson of Saint-R√©my. However, this was not a result of the Norman Conquest directly, but was intended as confirmation of a grant to the French abbey by √Ülfgar, Earl of Mercia, in the closing years of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy. Penkridge seems to have passed through the Conquest not only unscathed but enhanced in wealth and status: a royal manor, with a sizeable royal demesne and a substantial church, staffed by a community of clerics. However, it was clearly not, in the modern sense, a town. Penkridge itself would have been a small village on the southern bank of the River Penk, with the homes of the laity grouped to the east of the church, along the Stafford-Worcester road, and with a scattering of hamlets in the surrounding area. Medieval Penkridge =St. Michael's Collegiate Church= General view of the church from the east. It has dominated the town since its foundation in the late Anglo-Saxon period, although the present appearance of the building is mainly the result of 16th century rebuilding. The church was the most notable feature of Penkridge from late Anglo-Saxon times. By the 13th century, it had reached a distinctive form. :* It was a chapel royal - a place set aside by the monarchs for their own use. This made it independent of the local Bishop of Lichfield - an institution called a Royal Peculiar. :* It was a collegiate church, staffed by a college of priests, who formed its chapter. :* It was organised like a cathedral chapter. :* It was headed by the Archbishop of Dublin. The college was already a well-established institution by the Norman Conquest. The nine clerics mentioned in Domesday were far too many for a small village and served a wide area of Staffordshire from their base in Penkridge. The priests who belonged the college were often called canons, the usual term for permanent staff attached to a cathedral or large church. As a body, they were also known as a chapter. The chapter survived the Norman Conquest in much the same form as in Anglo-Saxon times. Throughout its existence, it was made up of secular clergy, not monks.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 34 In all this, St. Michael's, Penridge, was similar to its nearby namesake, St. Michael's Collegiate Church at Tettenhall,VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 37 to St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton, and to St Mary's College at Stafford.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 35 All were chapels royal, similarly organised and zealously guarding their independence. They formed an indigestible block within the borders of the diocese of Lichfield, whose bishop was the ordinary - the officer responsible for carrying out the laws of the Church and maintaining proper order in the region. Sometimes it seems that they acted in concert, forming a united front against determined bishops. This was in stark contrast to the relative malleability of the small, local parish churches. The church and college lost their independence only during the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign. Keen to consolidate the support of the church for his coup against Empress Matilda, Stephen gave the churches of Penkridge and Stafford to Roger de Clinton, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. At some time after the first Plantagenet ruler, Henry II, took over in 1154, Penkridge escaped episcopal control. Certainly by 1180 it was again the possession of the king. In the meantime, it had been reorganised to a template derived from the chapter of Lichfield Cathedral, which was established on the same lines in the mid-12th century. Like a cathedral, the college was now headed by a dean. The first dean was called Robert but little else is known of him. The canons were now prebendaries, meaning that each was supported by revenue from a fixed group of estates and rights that constituted his prebend, and which was technically attached to his choir stall, not to him personally. There were prebends of Coppenhall, Stretton, Shareshill, Dunston, Penkridge, Congreve, and Longridge. It is possible that the prebend of Penkridge absorbed the lands held by the nine priests of the Domesday survey.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16, s.3. In addition, two prebends were later created for the two chantries. For many decades Cannock was also a prebend of Penkridge, although it was strongly disputed by the chapter of Lichfield, and seems to have slipped out of Penkridge's grasp permanently in the mid-14th century. In 1215, the year of Magna Carta, King John conferred the advowson of the deanery - or right to appoint a dean - on Henry de Loundres, or Henry of London, a devoted servant of the Crown who had once been Archdeacon of Stafford, and had recently been consecrated Archbishop of Dublin. John was under enormous pressure from the barons, so he was keen to consolidate his supporters. The Hose or Hussey family had been granted the manor of Penkridge some time previously, but in 1215 Hugh Hose, the putative successor to the manor, was a ward of King John. John induced him to convey the manor to the archbishop, along with Congreve, Wolgarston, Cowley, Beffcote, and Little Onn (in Church Eaton), all of which were considered \\"members\\" or constituent parts of Penkridge manor. The archbishop used the opportunity to enrich both his family and his diocese. He divided the manor permanently into two unequal parts. Two-thirds he gave to his nephew, Andrew de Blund. The remaining third Henry gave to the church: it became known as the deanery manor. The de Blund family, later rendered as Blount, held the manor of Penkridge for about 140 years, finally selling it to other lay lords. Along with the prebends and various other holdings, the Deanery Manor was to finance the college of St. Michael for more than 300 years. When the newly enriched deanery fell vacant in 1226, Henry seized the opportunity to appoint himself to the post. Although John's son, Henry III challenged this by appointing a dean of his own, the relevant charter was recovered and the principle established that the deanery of Penkridge was to be held by the archbishops of Dublin, as it was from this point until the Reformation. This was an arrangement unique to Penkridge. File:Penkridge St Michael - West window exterior.jpgExterior view of the western end of the church, showing large Perpendicular window.

Originally this part of the church was a Littleton family chapel. Penkridge church several times had to make a stand to preserve its independence against both the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield and the wider Province of Canterbury. In 1259 the Archdeacon of Stafford tried to carry out a canonical visitation, a tour of inspection, on behalf of the diocese. Henry III wrote personally to him, ordering him to desist. The Second Council of Lyons in 1274 denounced a number of abuses for which the prebendaries of the chapels royal were notorious, including non-residence and pluralism. In 1280 the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham, fired with righteous indignation by the council's strictures, tried to carry out a visitation of all the royal chapels that lay within the Coventry and Lichfield diocese. The Penkridge College denied him access to the church, as did those of Wolverhampton, Tettenhall and Stafford, although the latter had to be ordered to resist by a letter from the king, Edward I. The canons of Penkridge appealed to the Pope, while Peckham pronounced excommunication upon them. However, he took care to exclude from his sentence John de Derlington, dean of Penkridge and Archbishop of Dublin, and thus his peer. After more than a year of threats and negotiations, pressure from the king compelled Peckham to drop the issue quietly. There were similar wrangles throughout the 14th century about whether the pope could appoint canons to prebends at the church. After lengthy and complex manoeuvres, the Crown emerged victorious around 1380, under Richard II, who was able to profit from the schism in the Papacy. The only major lapse came in 1401, when Henry IV, having seized the throne from Richard, was heavily dependent on the support Thomas Arundel, then Archbishop of Canterbury. Arundel used the opportunity to force through a visitation of all the chapels royal in Staffordshire, Penkridge included. Every member of the chapter or deputy was subjected to secret interrogation by two of Arundel's commissioners, and some parishioners were also brought in for questioning, although there were no great consequences for the college. Once the deanery became fixed on the archbishops of Dublin, the deans were almost always absentees. It seems that most of the canons too were usually absent. This was not unusual in the collegiate churches: the record at Wolverhampton was much worse. There was an inevitable tension between the status of St. Michael's as a chapel royal and its role as a village church. The primary use to which kings put their chapels was as chantries - institutions in which daily prayers and masses were said for the souls of the monarchs and royal family. This would have been the case from the foundation of the church, but by the mid-14th century there were two priests specifically responsible for this function, one for the Chantry of the King, the other for the Chantry of the Virgin Mary. This focus on the dead was only one issue distancing the church from the concerns of the local community. Essentially it was a national rather than a local institution. Its primary purpose was to serve the monarchy and one of the ways it did this was by providing an avenue for preferment. Appointment to the chapter of a wealthy cathedral or chapel was a means of enriching key royal ministers or supporters, so such appointments were not made with the needs of the community in mind, and they were often held in combination with many similar posts. The regular worship was conducted by vicars and other priests, usually paid by the prebendaries or from special funds set up for the purpose. Occasionally abuses and corruption surfaced. Royal inquisitions in 1261 and 1321 found that those canons who were resident tended to make free with the property of the college, at the expense of the absentees, and the 1321 inquiry also implicated the chantry priests in wasting resources. By the late Middle Ages, the expectations of ordinary people were beginning to rise and there was a demand for more participation in worship by the laity. Consequently, by the 16th century, the people of Penkridge were paying for their own morrow-mass priest, who ensured there was a daily mass for the people to attend.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 34 =Magnates and manors= Chest tomb c.1530 thought to be that of Robert Willougby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, north transept, St.Andrew's Church, Bere Ferrers, Devon. He became lord of Penkridge in the early 16th century. Economic and social life in medieval Penkridge were enacted within the manor, the basic territorial unit of feudal society, which regulated the economic and social relationships of its members and enforced the law on them. The manor was sometimes co-extensive with the village, but not always. Penkridge was initially a royal manor, a situation that still had real meaning in 1086, when Domesday found that the king had land and a mill at Penkridge being directly worked for him by a small team. The situation changed, probably in the 12th century, when one of the kings gave it as a fief to the Hose or Hussey family, paving the way for its subsequent grant to Archbishop Henry de Loundres, who divided it into lay and deanery manors for his family and ecclesiastical successors respectively. This did not go unchallenged, and the Husseys raised claims to Penkridge occasionally until the 16th century - a lingering dispute typical of feudal land tenure - although their actual possessions shrank to a couple of small holdings at Wolgarston.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5: 16. s.3 Penkridge manor and the Deanery Manor were by no means the only manors within Penkridge parish. In fact, there were many, of various sizes and tenures. A list of the different medieval manors and estates would include:VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5: 16. s.2 :* Penkridge Manor. This passed through the Blund or Blount family until, in 1363, John Blount conveyed it to John de Beverley. This sale was contested by John's mother, Joyce, who claimed a third back as part of her dowry. Ultimately the manor was conveyed whole to John de Beverley and, on his death in 1480, to his widow, Amice, who survived until 1416. Amice held the manor in her own name in chief, i.e. directly from the king, by knight service, i.e. in return for supplying military assistance to the king. Amice leased half the manor to Sir Humphrey Stafford of Hook, in Dorset and her heirs sold this land to him. The exact history of the other half is unclear, but Humphrey's grandson, also called Humphrey, seems to have reunited the manor under his control and was known as \\"Lord of Penkridge\\" in his later years. These Humphrey Staffords were distant relatives of the local de Staffords. The younger Humphrey died in 1461 and Penkridge passed, via his heirs, into the hands of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, a distinguished soldier and courtier of Henry VIII. :* Penkridge Deanery Manor, held by successive Archbishops of Dublin from the 1220s. baronetcy. :* Congreve, which was originally a part or \\"member\\" of Penkridge manor. As late as the 19th century, the lords of Congreve paid a tiny rent, ¬£1 1s., to the lords of Penkridge. In the 13th century the Teveray family became established at Congreve, although not without protracted disputes, and by 1302 it was being described as a manor. In the 14th century, the Dumbleton family acquired all the rights from the disputing parties and were soon being addressed as de Congreve. The same Congreve family held the manor until modern times, residing at Congreve Manor House. :* Congreve Prebendal Manor, which belonged to St. Michael's College, and was centred on Congreve House, about 250m. from the Manor House. :* Drayton, also originally a part of Penkridge manor. The overlordship was held by the de Staffords from the 12th century and the Barons Stafford claimed it for centuries after. However, Hervey Bagot, who had married Millicent de Stafford, got into protracted and complex legal difficulties over the tenure of Drayton. These were ultimately resolved by all parties agreeing to give the manor to the Augustinian priory of St. Thomas near Stafford. :* Gailey, which had once been granted to Burton Abbey by Wulfric Spot. By the 12th century the de Staffords were overlords and granted it as a fief to one Rennerius, who in turn gave it to the nuns of Blithbury priory. It then passed quickly to Black Ladies Priory, Brewood, before being acquired by the king around 1189, to become a hay or division of the royal forest of Cannock or Cannock Chase. :* Levedale, which also had the de Staffords as overlords. At Domesday the tenants were Brien and Drew and, for centuries after, the mesne lords, or intermediate tenants were descendants of Brien, the de Standon family. In the mid-12th century, the terre tenant, the actual resident lord of the manor, was Engenulf de Gresley, who had no sons but divided the manor among his three daughters. This unleashed a series of family disputes, legal wrangles and displays of petty greed that went on for centuries. For example, around 1272, Amice, widow of Henery of Verdun, a deceased lord of Levedale, abducted her own son from the custody of the overlord, Robert de Standon. Robert took Amice to court, where she was forced to admit to the facts of the case, and was ordered to return young Henry to Robert.Staffordshire Assize Roll for 56 Henry III :* Longridge, which seems to have belonged to the prebend of Coppenhall, and so formed part of the estates of St. Michael's College. However, a number of small landowners held a considerable part of it, apparently as tenants of the prebend. :* Lyne Hill or Linhull, apparently belonging to the deanery, but mainly in the hands of a family who are called variously de Linhill, de Lynhull, Lynell or Lynehill. :* Mitton, which had the de Staffords as overlords and the de Standons as mesne lords, like Levedale. By the mid-11th century, it was in the hands of a family known as de Mutton. Isabel de Mutton inherited the estate while still an infant around 1241 and was taken into the custody of Robert de Stafford. Custody was contested by the de Standons, who claimed the de Muttons were their direct tenants at Mitton, and that they were 40s. out of pocket because of Robert's high-handed actions. Robert claimed, on the contrary, that the de Mittons held two other properties directly of himself. The de Standons argued that theirs was a prior claim. After a long wrangle, Robert de Stafford agreed to hand over the heiress to the de Standons.Plea Rolls for Staffordshire, 1250, Roll No. 85. Later Isabel married Philip de Chetwynd of Ingestre. He almost lost Mitton during the Second Barons' War. He was accused of helping Ralph Basset of Drayton Bassett to seize Stafford and hold it against a royalist army. His estates were forfeit but under the Dictum of Kenilworth he was allowed to redeem them from Robert Blundel, who had been given the redemption by the King. He stoutly maintained his innocence of all charges throughout.Plea Rolls for Staffordshire, 1271-72, Roll No. 167. Mitton passed into the estates of the Chetwynd family of Ingestre through the son of Isabel and Philip, also called Philip. During her second marriage, to Roger de Thornton, Isabel energetically harried tenants whom she accused of cutting down trees and taking fish from her pools. :* La More (later Moor Hall), a small manor to just west of Penkridge. Its overlord was the church of St. Michael, to which it returned whenever there was an interregnum among the tenants, the de la More family. The chief of these occurred from 1293, when William de la More was hanged for a felony. :* Otherton, another small manor, but old enough to be mentioned in Domesday. In late Anglo-Saxon times it was held by Ailric, but by 1886 it was part of the de Stafford barony, although held by Clodoan. In the 13th century the overlordship passed to the de Loges family of Great Wyrley and in the 14th to the lords of Rodbaston, the de Haughton family. The manor was actually held by a local family who took their surname from it, the de Othertons, until it passed to the Wynnesbury family of Pillaton in the 15th century. :* Pillaton, a small manor east of Penkridge. The overlord was Burton Abbey, which had received the land from Wulfric Spot in 1044. It was held from the abbey by a succession of families and became part of the Wynnesbury lands in the 15th century. :* Preston, which belonged to the College of St. Michael after it was made part of the prebend of Penkridge by the gift of a woman called Avice in the mid-13th century. The canons let it to a succession of tenants, who paid a tithe to the prebend. :* Rodbaston, which also existed before the Norman Conquest, and was held by an Anglo-Saxon free man called Alli in 1066. After belonging for some centuries to the lords of Great Wyrley, it was united with Penkridge manor in the hands of John de Beverley around 1372. :* Water Eaton, another pre-Conquest manor that came under de Stafford overlordship. They let it to the de Stretton family, who subsequently became overlords and let it to sub-tenants. These were the de Beysin family, who became embroiled in a protract disputes with the Crown over encroachments on the estate by the royal forest. In 1315 they went so far as to petition Parliament for an enquiry into the matter. Ultimately the de Beysins rented out the land and ceased to live locally.

Effigy of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke (d.1502), St Mary's Church, Callington, Cornwall. With the Willoughby family and their successors, the Grevilles, Coppenhall's history came into parallel with that of Penkridge, which they also acquired in the 16th century. :* Whiston, which came under the overlordship of Burton Abbey from 1004. One of the tenants, a John de Whiston, fought as a knight at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346. Subsequently the manor fell into a slough of litigation when a succession of short-lived lords of the manor (probably the result of the Black Death, left their heirs intractable problems of tenure. :* Coppenhall or Copehale, now a separate parish from Penkridge, although part of it in the middle ages. It was a manor in Anglo-Saxon times and at Domesday the overlords were the de Staffords, although the tenant was a man called Bueret. His sone, Ulpher de Coppenhall, divided the manor in two, introducing the Bagot family, whose half was called the Hyde.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:18.s.2. Manors The Bagots seem to have been prone to particularly vicious family disputes. The Staffordshire Plea rolls for 1250 record that Ascira, the widow of Robert Bagot, sued William Bagot, presumably her stepson, for a third of various properties at Coppenhall and the Hyde, and elsewhere, as her dower. William replied that Ascira had never been lawfully married to his father, and the case was referred to the Bishop of Worcester.Plea Rolls for Staffordshire, 1250, Roll No. 85. The Bagots maintained a presence at the Hyde until the 14th century, when the line died out and the land reverted to the de Staffords. Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, died fighting for Henry IV at the Battle of Shrewsbury. The infant heir became the king's ward and Henry used the opportunity to grant part of Coppenhall to his new wife, Joan of Navarre. The remainder stayed with the Barons Stafford and they granted it to their relatives, the de Staffords of Hooke, Dorset. After further disputes and complications, it ended in the hands of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke. :* Dunston, originally a member of Penkridge manor. By 1166, Robert de Stafford was recognised as overlord and Hervey de Stretton was his tenant at Dunston, although the de Staffords themselves retained land at Dunston at least until the 16th century.Victoria County History: Staffordshire, Volume 5:19.s. 2. The lordship and the bulk of the land descended in the de Stretton family for several generations but, by 1285, they were renting most of their land to the Pickstock family, and in 1316 John Pickstock was named as lord of Dunston. The Pickstocks's were burgesses of the county town of Stafford and remained lords of the manor for several generations until John Pickstock granted most of his lands to members of the Derrington family in 1437. :* Stretton, also now outside Penkridge parish. Before the Norman Conquest it had been held by three thegns, but Domesday found it held by Hervey de Stretton under the overlordship of Robert de Stafford. By the 14th century the Congreve family owned the manor. The complexity of land tenure in feudal Penkridge is obvious. The actual cultivators, mainly villeins and other lowly labourers, were at the bottom of a social pyramid that could have four or five layers under the king at its apex. This was due to the practice of subinfeudation, by which estates were constantly granted and re-granted, often sub-divided, in return for feudal dues - typically military service. Low life expectancy, especially during times of war and plague, created constant succession disputes. A common complaint was that of the widow, often neglected by children or step-children, who then launched legal action to regain life interest in part of the estate - usually a third. Infant heirs fell into the clutches of the overlord, sometimes the king, who was in a position to exploit the estate unmercifully during the minority and to extort a hefty feudal relief on succession, as did John and Henry IV. Lack of a male heir often led to temporary or permanent division of an estate among daughters, giving ample opportunity for further family dispute. It was this sort of dispute finally exasperated Hervey Bagot and his rivals and induced them to give Drayton to the Church.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2. Manors The Staffords were a powerful family with many branches, and with great influence in regional and national affairs, stemming from a grant of large estates to Robert de Stafford by William the Conqueror. They were important as both overlords and as actual working landowners in the region around Stafford, including Penkridge parish. Beneath them came a class of middling landowners, who often had many holdings at different levels in the feudal pyramid. A good example was Hugh de Loges, a mid-13th-century baron, who was lord of Great Wyrley in Cannock; lord of Lyne Hill in Penkridge, which he probably held of the Penkridge deanery manor; lord of Otherton, where he owed fealty to the de Staffords; and lord of Rodbaston, which he held by serjeanty in Cannock Chase. The Church was a major landowner in Penkridge and the extent of church holdings was to have important consequences during the Reformation, as church property was seized by the Crown. However, many estates were very small, with petty manorial lords struggling to meet their dues and debts. Even the most minor lord of the manors had great power over his tenants, especially the villeins and others bound to the estate. Typical of the rights enjoyed by a small manorial lord would be those claimed by St. Michael's at La More in 1293: :* View of frankpledge - holding tenants collectively responsible for lawbreaking :* Assize of Bread and Ale - regulating the price and quality of foodstuffs and imposing fines on offenders :* Infangthief - pursuit and punishment of offenders within the manor. A more important landowner, like John de Beverley, in 1372 acquired the rights of: :* Outfangthief - transferring offenders caught outside the manor to his own court for summary justice :* Gallows - capital punishment of offenders :* Waif and stray - confiscating any animal found wandering or lost.

From their memorial, in the floor of the south chancel aisle, St. Michael's church. Richard Littleton and Alice Wynnesbury, on incised slab of their recessed table tomb in the south nave aisle, St. Michael's church. From the 14th century, the feudal system in Penkridge, as elsewhere, began to break down. Edward I's law Quia Emptores of 1290 changed the legal framework radically by banning subinfeudation. The Black Death and population collapse of the 14th century made labour expensive and land relatively cheap, encouraging landowners to look for money from rents, with which they paid for labour. In the 15th century, a new regime of cash, commodities, wages, rents and leases took shape, and with it came great changes in land tenure. The most important beneficiaries were to be the Littleton family. Richard Littleton was the second son of Thomas de Littleton, a prominent jurist from Frankley, Worcestershire. Thomas had direct connections to the area, as he had married Joan Burley, widow of the fifth Philip Chetwynd, lord of Mitton. Richard first appears as a tenant and perhaps steward of William Wynnesbury, who held Pillaton and Otherton in the late 15th century. Richard married Alice, his landlord's daughter, who inherited the estates When William died in 1502. Alice passed them on her death to her son, Sir Edward Littleton. Pillaton Hall, which they rebuilt, was to be the seat of the Littletons for two and a half centuries, and from it they built a property empire, using leases as the key. Land leases - typically of twenty years - gave them effective management of larger and larger estates. When the opportunity to buy appeared, they were in the best position to do so, as an extant lease deterred other buyers. Richard died in 1518, although Alice survived him by eleven years. They were buried in a table tomb in a new family chapelVCH:Staffordshire: Volume 5:17.s.5 Churches in St. Michael's church. =The traditional economy= Medieval Penkridge was clearly a place of ecclesiastical and commercial importance, but most of its population was at least partly dependent on agriculture for a living. Agricultural expansion was greatly impeded by the Forest Law imposed after the Norman Conquest, which preserved the wildlife and ecology of the area for the king's enjoyment through a savage penal code. Large areas surrounding Penkridge were incorporated into the Royal Forest of Cannock or Cannock Chase, forming the divisions of the forest known as Gailey Hay and Teddesley Hay. The forest extended in a broad arc across Staffordshire, with Cannock Chase bordering Brewood Forest at the River Penk, and the latter stretching to meet Kinver Forest to the south. The First Barons' War of the 13th century initiated a process of gradual relaxation of the laws, starting with the first issue of the Forest Charter in 1217. So it was in Henry III's reign that Penkridge began to grow economically and probably in population. Local people were quick to seize any chance that presented itself. In the mid-13th century there were complaints about assarting, clearing of trees and scrub to create fields, by the residents of Otherton and Pillaton. However, the struggle against the forests was not over. At times the kings' servants tried to push forward the boundaries of the forest, particularly from Gailey Hay along the southern edge of the parish. Much of the area was cultivated under the open field system. The names of the open fields and common meadows in Penkridge were recorded for the first time just as they were about to be enclosed, in the 16th and 17th centuries, although they must have existed throughout the Middle Ages. In Penkridge manor in the early 16th century, the open fields were Clay Field, Prince Field, Manstonshill, Mill Field, Wood Field, and Lowtherne or Lantern Field. In the 17th century there were mentions of Fyland, Old Field, and Whotcroft. Stretton Meadow and Hay Meadow seem to have been common grazing, the latter on the right bank of the Penk, between the Cuttlestone and Bull Bridges. The Deanery Manor had at least two open fields, called Longfurlong and Clay Field, the latter perhaps adjoining the land of the same name in Penkridge manor. In most of the smaller manors, too, open fields are known to have existed. For example, Rodbaston had Low Field, Overhighfield and Netherfield.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5:17:s.2. Initially the cultivators were mainly unfree, villeins or even slaves, forced to work on the lord's land in return for their strips in the open fields. However, this pattern would have collapsed from the mid-14th century, as the Black Death drastically reduced the labour supply and, with it, the value of land. In 1535, as the Priory of St. Thomas faced dissolution, its manor of Drayton was worth ¬£9 4s. 8d. annually, and the lion's share, ¬£5 18s. 2d., came from rents.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2. Manors This pattern of commuting labour service for rent was more or less complete by this time and landlords used the money to buy in labour when required. There are no detailed records of what was grown in medieval Penkridge. In 1801, when the first record was made, nearly half was under wheat, with barley, oats, peas, beans, and brassicas the other major crops - probably similar to the medieval pattern: farmers grew wheat wherever the land in their scattered strips supported it, and other crops elsewhere, with cattle on the riverside meadows and sheep on the heath. =Markets and mills= Markets were potentially very lucrative for manorial lords but it was necessary to obtain a royal charter before one could be instituted. Hugh Hose's grant of Penkridge manor to the Archbishop of Dublin in 1215 included the right to hold an annual fair, although it is not known whether Hugh had actually obtained the right to hold one. Nevertheless, Edward I recognised Hugh le Blund's right to a fair in 1278 and the grant was confirmed to Hugh and his heirs by Edward II in 1312.VCH Staffordshire:Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.4. John de Beverley,VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16. got confirmation of the fair in 1364, and it passed down with the manor until at least 1617. The precise date varied considerably, but in the Middle Ages it fell around the end of September and lasted for seven or eight days. Although it was initially a general fair, it gradually grew into a horse fair. Henry III granted Andrew le Blund a weekly market in 1244 and John de Beverley gained recognition for this also in 1364. When Amice, his widow remarried, the market was challenged as unfair competition to the burgesses of Stafford ‚Äì an accusation they frequently made against markets in the area, including also that at Brewood. Presumably Amice vindicated her right to a market because she was able to pass it on to her successors at her death in 1416. For centuries the market was held every Tuesday. The marketplace was situated at the eastern end of the town, the opposite end from the church. It is still so-named, although it is no longer used for the purpose. After 1500 the market declined and faded out. It was revived several times, also changing days. The modern market is an entirely new institution on a different site. Water power was plentiful in the Penkridge area, with the River Penk and a number of tributary brooks able to drive mills. Mills are regularly mentioned in land records and wills because they were such a source of profit to the owner. For the same reason, they were a major cause of grievance among tenants, who were compelled to use the lord's mill and to pay for the service, usually in kind. Domesday records a mill at Penkridge itself and another at Water Eaton. A century later there were two mills at Penkridge, one of them later named as the broc mill ‚Äì presumably on one of the brooks that flow into the Penk. One of the Penkridge mills was given to William Houghton, Archbishop of Dublin, by the de la More family in 1298, but it appears that the same family continued to operate the mill, as a later archbishop granted them mill pond at an annual rent of 1d. in 1342. There was a mill at Drayton by 1194 and Hervey Bagot gave it to St. Thomas's Priory, along with the manor. Mills are recorded at Congreve, Pillaton, and Rodbaston in the 13th century, at Whiston in the 14th, and at Mitton in the 15th. These were all primarily corn mills, but water power was harnessed to many other purposes even in the Middle Ages: in 1345 we hear of a fulling mill at Water Eaton, as well as the corn mill.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.2.

Reformation and revolution: the early modern period =Dissolution= The Reformation brought profound changes to life in Penkridge and its parish. It affected not just the church and religious life, but the entire pattern of ownership and control. The Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536 was intended to apply to houses worth less than ¬£200, clear of expenses. This covered the Priory of St. Thomas, near Stafford, which had held the manor of Drayton since 1194. As soon as the act was passed, Rowland Lee, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, wrote to his friend Thomas Cromwell, pressing his suit for the priory's lands. The priory housed only the prior himself and five canons but the priory estates were well-managed and brought in about ¬£180 per year ‚Äì not far short of the threshold, and very much more than most houses covered by the act. As a result, the canons were able to bribe their way out of trouble initially, paying the sum of ¬£133 6s. 8d. for special \\"toleration and continuance\\". In 1537 they continued to send money to Cromwell, first ¬£60, then ¬£20, and finally a request to be excused a further ¬£20. This was precisely the excuse Lee needed to accuse them of wasting the priory's resources. He asked that the estates be handed over to him \\"at an easy rent that the poor boys my nephews may have some relief thereby.\\" The priory was surrendered in October 1538. Lee immediately moved in and bought large parts of the building fabric and livestock for ¬£87.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 17 - The Priory of St. Thomas near Stafford A year later, the rest of the priory property, including Drayton and large estates in Baswich, was granted as a fief to Lee. When he died in 1543, the greater part went to his \\"poor boys\\", Brian Fowler and three other nephews. Drayton was thus taken from the church and became lay property. It was to stay with the Fowlers until it was bought by the Littletons in 1790.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2 ‚Äì Manors The Dissolution of the Monasteries entered a final stage with the Second Act of Dissolution in 1539. The manors Bickford, Whiston and Pillaton were technically under the overlordship of Burton Abbey. The abbey had never actually managed the estates, and the manorial lords who occupied them paid small rents for the land. Sir Edward Littleton (died 1558) had his seat at Pillaton Hall, while Bickford and Whiston were held by Sir John Giffard (died 1556) of Chillington Hall, near Brewood. Burton Abbey was surrendered by its monks early in 1539 after an outbreak of Iconoclasm. Overlordship of all three manors passed from the abbey to the Crown, and the Crown later sold it to Sir William Paget a moderate Protestant supporter of the protector Somerset during the minority of Edward VI. Littleton and Giffard both simply transferred payment of their rent to the new overlord and their families continued to prosper throughout the century, the Giffards despite their Catholic Recusancy. Edward VI's reign brought a more ideological phase of the Reformation, with Somerset and then Northumberland pursuing increasingly radical policies through the boy king. The chantry churches, many of them very wealthy, were despised by Protestants. A movement to abolish them gathered in the final years of Henry VIII and it was at this stage that many chapters tried to make a final profit by selling long leases to secular landlords. Thus it was that St. Michael's leased most of its estates to Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall and his successors for the very long term of 80 years. However, the abolition movement did not come to fruition in Henry's reign, with only a small number of chantries wound up under an Act of 1545. The Chantries Act of 1547, in the new reign, abolished all chantries and their associated colleges. St. Michael's College was still a thriving institution and its church physically dominated the town as never before. It was during this period that major rebuilding and modifications turned it into the impressive building it is today. The church's estates wholly or partly supported the dean (who was still the current archbishop of Dublin), seven prebendaries, two resident canons who were responsible for the two chantries, an official principal, three vicars choral, three further vicars, a high deacon, a subdeacon, and a sacrist. Most of the lands of the college were leased out to lay magnates ‚Äì primarily to Edward Littleton, whose leases included the whole of the deanery and the college house, as well as the farm of the prebends of Stretton, Shareshill, Coppenhall and Penkridge. In 1547 the college's property was assessed as worth ¬£82 6s. 8d. annually.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 34 The abolition act dissolved the entire institution of the college. The Chantries Commissioners, who took over the assets, appointed the first Vicar of Penkridge: Thomas Bolt, a priest from Stafford, who was assigned ¬£16 per annum. The former vicar-choral, William Graunger, was made his assistant, on ¬£8. A more distant chapel, in the exclave of Shareshill, was soon also set up as an independent parish church, but those at Coppenhall, Dunston and Stretton were to remain dependent on Penkridge for another three centuries.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.5. Churches The college property, still leased and managed in practice by Littleton, was granted by the Crown to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, a key figure in Edward VI's regency council, and shortly to emerge as the leading man in the land, with the title Duke of Northumberland. Penkridge's history now became closely embedded in that of the monarchy and the course of the Reformation, while Dudley intervened vigorously on the side of Littleton in local property disputes, despite Littleton's religious conservatism. Dudley's local interests paralleled his meteoric national career, which brought him to the heights of power in the realm before a rapid and disastrous fall. =The Dudley Inheritance= John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, who briefly held the overlordship of both Penkridge manor and the deanery before his political ambitions led to his execution. Sir Edward Littleton, who succeeded in 1574 and died in 1610, as portrayed on the double tomb in St. Michael's. His acquisition of the deanery lands in 1585 was a major step towards his family's dominance of the area. Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke. The Grevilles held the manor of Penkridge for several generations, but also had substantial holdings elsewhere in the Midlands. Shortly before his acquisition of the College lands, Dudley had also come by the manor of Penkridge. This was the result of a deal made by Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, who held the manor of Penkridge at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1507, in need of ready cash, he raised money by mortgaging Penkridge to Edmund Dudley, Henry VII's hated financial agent. In 1510 Dudley was executed by Henry VIII, nominally for treason, but actually, because his extreme unpopularity tarnished the monarchy. In 1519 Willoughby mortgaged the manor to George Monoux, a prominent London businessman. He then passed on the estate through his co-heirs, his granddaughters, Elizabeth and Blanche. The latter died shortly after, and it became the property of Elizabeth and her husband, Fulke Greville. With debts unpaid, Monoux was able to foreclose on the estate. The situation was complicated by the Dudley family's older claim. In 1539, to resolve the situation, Monoux granted the whole manor, no doubt for a consideration, to Edmund Dudley's heir ‚Äì Robert Dudley, Earl of Warwick. He, in turn, settled it on his son, John Viscount Lisle and his wife, Anne Seymour, Protector Somerset's daughter.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2. Manors In addition to the Penkridge manor and the church lands, Dudley also acquired large holdings in the wastes to the east and south-east. In 1550 he was granted Teddesley Hay, a large tract to the north-east of Penkridge that was now deforested. Strictly not part of Penkridge, but an extra-parochial area because of its history as part of Cannock Chase, Teddesley Hay was virgin territory, still undrained and uncultivated: as late as 1666, its population liable to hearth tax was counted as just three.VCH:Staffordshire: Volume 5:23.s.2 Teddesley Hay At the same time he was granted Gailey Hay, another large area of waste that had been part of the royal forest since King John had taken it from Black Ladies Priory in 1200.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2. Manors Dudley went on to overthrow Somerset and to have him executed, placing himself in unchallenged power over the young king and the country. When Edward died in 1553, his sister Mary, a Catholic, was his successor according to both the will of Henry VIII and Act of Parliament. Dudley attempted a coup d'√©tat to enthrone his Protestant daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey. Mary rallied her supporters and marched on London. Dudley was quickly arrested, tried and executed As a traitor, his lands were forfeit to the Crown. This placed in doubt the future of extensive lands at Penkridge and the final resolution took more than thirty years. The former St. Michael's church estates were all retained by the Crown as overlord. The Crown also retained the advowson of the parish for the time being. Mary's Counter-reformation was very partial and very parsimonious. The monasteries were not restored and only Wolverhampton was revived among the chapels royal: St. Michael's College had gone, never to return. The deanery house itself was rented out. The lands were leased, mainly to the Littletons. Penkridge manor belonged to the younger John Dudley, who was arrested and condemned to death, like his father. He was reprieved, although he lost Penkridge manor and his other lands to the Crown in 1554, and died shortly after his release from prison. His widow, Anne, was allowed to retain a life interest in Penkridge. She remarried only a year later. When she was declared insane in 1566, her second husband, Sir Edward Unton, took control. The only quick resolution came with Teddesley Hay. On Dudley's execution, his widow was allowed to retain an interest in it, but she died in 1555. It was sold to the Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall. The next Sir Edward, who succeeded in 1558, was keen to make something of this wilderness. His vigorous enclosure of the area soon upset neighbouring landowners and their tenants. Gailey Hay also went to Dudley's widow but, after her death, rights and ownership were sold off piecemeal, creating a complex patchwork of competing claims that lingered for three centuries. Mary's Protestant sister and successor, Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603), passed through Penkridge in 1575: the visit was without incident. Nothing was done to resolve the situation of the manors of Penkridge. Not until 1581 was the former College property sold to new owners, granted by the Crown to speculators. Edmund Downynge and Peter Aysheton. They sold it on only two years later to John Morley and Thomas Crompton, who also sold it very quickly, in 1585, to Sir Edward Littleton. His family had actually managed the land for decades as lessees and seem to have made a fortune from it. The bulk of the deanery estate was to stay with the Littleton family until the 20th century. With the death of Sir Edward Unton in 1582, Queen Elizabeth gave the reversion of the Penkridge manor to Sir Fulke Greville, son of the Fulke and Elizabeth who had held it in Henry VIII's time. However, Anne Dudley was still alive and could not be dispossessed. Her estates were managed by her son, Edward Unton the younger, until her death in 1588. So it was not until 1590 that Greville came into full possession of the manor. =Civil war= Civil War period dress, now on the north chancel wall of St. Michael's church. Greville's focus of interest lay in Warwickshire, around Alcester, rather than in Penkridge. On his death in 1606, his estates passed to his son, another Fulke Greville, a poet and statesman who had served Elizabeth well and was to become a mainstay of James I's administration. In 1604 James had presented him with the ruined Warwick Castle, which became his seat, and on which he lavished most of his attention and much of his fortune. In 1621 he was made the 1st Baron Brooke. He held Penkridge until his death in 1628, murdered at Warwick Castle by a servant who resented his treatment in Greville's will. As he was unmarried and childless, he had adopted a younger cousin as his son and heir to the Brooke Barony and most of his estates, including Penkridge manor. This cousin was Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, an important figure in the parliamentary opposition to Charles I and in the early stages of the English Civil War. Robert was of pronounced Puritan sympathies. During the 1630s, with Parliament in abeyance, he promoted emigration to America, helping to finance the Saybrook Colony. When civil war broke out in 1642, it was inevitable that he would join the parliamentary army. As a man of considerable organisational ability, he soon emerged as a commanding figure in central England, where loyalties were divided and the course of the war was determined by a patchwork of sieges and skirmishes. After a series of victories in Warwickshire in 1643, he moved his forces to Lichfield, where a royalist force had holed up in the Cathedral. There, while directing his troops, a bullet cut him down. However, the succession to the manor was secure. Robert Greville was succeeded by Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke, and Penkridge manor remained with the Grevilles and their Brooke Barony for another century. William Lloyd, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (1692-9). His bid for control over Penkridge parish was rebuffed by the Littletons. Despite apparent Puritan sympathies, the Littletons found themselves on the Royalist side. Sir Edward Littleton had been made a baronet by Charles I on 28 June 1627, albeit in exchange for a large sum of money acquired through marriage to Hester Courten, daughter of Sir William Courten, an immensely wealthy London textile merchant and financier. He inherited the estates from his father in 1629 and remained faithful to the king throughout the troubles of the 1630s and 1640s. He was Member of Parliament for Staffordshire from 1640 but was expelled from the House of Commons in 1644. In May 1645, royalist troops were quartered in the village, presumably because of Littleton's known royalist sympathies. A small parliamentary force expelled the royalist soldiers after a brief skirmish. Littleton's estates were subject to sequestration but, like most minor royalist sympathisers, he was able to recover them on payment of a substantial sum: ¬£1347. The family holdings were thus preserved and the family found themselves in favour again after the restoration of Charles II in 1660. One oddity left by the years of Reformation and revolution was that the peculiar jurisdiction of the old college of Penkridge was not itself abolished. Although the church became the centre of a large Anglican parish, it was still not absorbed into the Diocese of Lichfield. The lord of the manor assumed the role of chief official of the peculiar jurisdiction. After 1585 this was the head of the Littleton family ‚Äì always named Edward. For a time, in the late 17th century, the archbishops of Dublin claimed the right of canonical visitation ‚Äì a tenuous claim as their precessors had been dean, not ordinary, of the church. In the 1690s the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry permission to visit from Narcissus Marsh, archbishop of Dublin. Marsh granted a process to carry out a visitation of Penkridge to Bishop William Lloyd. The process was delivered to the churchwardens of St. Michael's, who immediately involved Sir Edward Littleton, the second baronet, and Littleton wrote in reply to the bishop. William Walmesley, chancellor of the diocese, came to Penkridge to look at the relevant documents and convinced himself that the Archbishop of Dublin had no right of visitation and, consequently, no right to delegate it to anyone else. Bishop Lloyd then called on Littleton to confirm this and had dinner with him. No more was heard of the matter. The Littletons continued to appoint the vicar and to keep the bishop at bay until the peculiar jurisdiction was abolished in 1858.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 3: 34 =The beginning of enclosure= Sir Edward Littleton (head of the family 1558-1574), bearing the Littleton arms, and Alice Cockayne, from their tomb in the chancel. This Sir Edward inherited a large area in Teddesley Hay and upset neighbouring landowners with his enclosure policy. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, clashed with Sir Edward Littleton over enclosures and defended his own tenant's interests vigorously. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries enclosure of the open fields, pastures and wastes advanced steadily. It was encouraged by the landowners, who hoped for higher productivity and improved land values. The Littletons were early converts to the cause of enclosure: as early as 1534 enclosures were taking place in the Deanery Manor,VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.2. Agriculture which they leased from the church at that time, although the manor was not fully enclosed until the mid-18th century. Enclosure was not always so welcome to occupiers and tenants, who often lost important grazing rights on common land, and who feared their spread of land in the open fields might be replaced by an inferior plot. It could also create tensions between neighbouring landlords. The Littletons carried out major enclosures in Teddesley Hay in the mid-16th century.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5: 23: s.1. This wild area posed far fewer challenges for the encloser than the more densely populated and intensively cultivated areas of Penkridge parish. However, there were still rows with neighbouring landowners and with cultivators who used the resources of the Hay. In 1561 Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford, complained that Sir Edward Littleton (d. 1574) was committing spoils there. In 1569 the Earl of Oxford complained that Littleton's enclosures prevented his tenants in Acton Trussell and Bednall pasturing their animals in the Hay and obstructed their common way to Cannock Wood and Cannock Heath. The Littletons went on to establish a park and coppice in the Hay. In 1675 the people of Penkridge and Bednall demanded that both be thrown open. The struggle was to continue until all common land in the Hay was finally enclosed in 1827. Enclosure was sometimes welcomed by all parties. In 1617 the common fields of the Littleton's manor of Otherton were enclosed by agreement with the occupiers.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.2. Agriculture In 1662, in Gailey Hay, where the land was divided into 25 parts owned by a number of landowners, the landlords agreed to fence the land to allow the tenants to cultivate it for five years, in return for one seventh of the crop. However, at the end of the 17th century, most of the land in Penkridge and the surrounding manors remained unenclosed, and much of that was still cultivated on the open field system.

Memorial to the 3rd Baron Hatherton, who began the process of selling off the Littleton estates in 1919. The 18th and 19th centuries brought vast changes to agriculture and industry, both locally and nationally. After prospering throughout the Georgian period and especially in the Napoleonic wars, when the Continental System and the Corn Laws together kept grain prices high, agriculture went through a series of crises in Victorian times that hit rural areas hard. However, Penkridge's progress was not entirely typical. The population figures are hard to establish and interpret but seem not simply to show growth followed by sustained decline, as we find, for example, at neighbouring Brewood. In 1666, the township of Penkridge contained 212 households. The rest of the parish had probably under a hundred households altogether.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.1. A population of 1200 to, at most, 1500, seems a reasonable estimate. In 1801, the first census recorded a population of 2,275 ‚Äì a definite increase ‚Äì and there were just over two hundred more in 1811.Penkridge: Total Population at A Vision of Britain Through time Thereafter the population rose steadily to a peak of 3316 in 1851. The next recorded total, for 1881, shows a considerable drop to 2536. However, this is not strictly comparable. The parish was partitioned in 1866 and the townships of Coppenhall, Dunston, and Stretton were made into separate parishes. Their total population in 1881 numbered nearly 600 and all three were at that time in decline. Penkridge itself seems to have had a fairly stable population for the century from 1851 to 1951. Of course, the population of the country as a whole rose rapidly in this period, so Penkridge's was in relative decline, and there must have been a drift to the towns, but the town did not suffer the collapse endured by nearby settlements. Agriculture continued to be the most important employer of labour throughout the Victorian period, although it did decline to some extent and it was never totally dominant. The 1831 census collected male employment data at the parish level. It shows 894 adult males in work. Of these, 90 were farmers and 394 agricultural labourers, so agriculture directly employed almost exactly 60% of the men.Penkridge 1831 Occupational Categories at A Vision of Britain through Time, transcribed by David Allan Gatley (School of Social Sciences, University of Staffordshire). The next largest category is those in retail and handicrafts, which accounts for 175. This significant number reflects Penkridge's continuing importance as a commercial centre. These men would be largely inhabitants of the town, while the agriculturalists would be much more widely dispersed throughout the parish. Although the market had been discontinued,VCH Staffordshire:Volume 5:17 ‚Äì Penkridge: Economic history, s.4. the town must have teemed with small shops and workshops. Not until fifty years later do we get parish-level employment data, this time including women, but not directly comparable. 305 of the 638 working men are accounted for by agriculture ‚Äì about 48%: a considerable, if not precipitous drop. The great majority of the women are shown as status unknown or not in a specified employment. Of those who are employed, 150, the vast majority, are in domestic service.Penkridge 1881 Occupational Orders at A Vision of Britain through Time, edited by Matthew Woollard (History Data Service, UK Data Archive, University of Essex). These actually form the largest single group of employees after the agriculturalists, and probably found work with many middle-class families as well as with the gentry. The hospitality industry seems to have been quite important: forty men are shown as working in food and lodging ‚Äì a significant number, although not surprising on a major route. Oddly only one woman is listed in the same trade: almost certainly many women worked part-time or in family concerns, without showing up in the figures. A good proportion of the 15 men working with carriages and horses probably serviced the inn customers too. The diversity of trades is marked. No less than 43 ‚Äì 25 women and 18 men ‚Äì were involved in dress-making, an important part of any retail centre at the time. There were quarrymen, traders, and many others. However, professionals are numbered at only 14. Most of these must have been associated with the church and the gentry estates: although a lively shopping centre, Penkridge did not have the numbers of lawyers and executives characteristic of the county towns and larger market towns. Penkridge owed much to its transport links, which were always good, but steadily improved. The main Stafford-Wolverhampton route, now the A449 road was turnpiked under an Act of 1760: there was a toll gate just north of the Rodbaston turning. Bull Bridge, which carries the road over the Penk, was rebuilt in 1796 and widened in 1822. The improved road quickly attracted traffic, with stops at Penkridge from coaches on the London - Manchester, Birmingham - Manchester, and Birmingham - Liverpool routes by 1818. New forms of transport had an even more profound impact. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, designed by James Brindley, opened in 1772, running straight through the parish and the township from north to south, and crossed by 15 bridges. There was an important wharf at Spread Eagle (named after a pub on Watling Street and later called Gailey) and another was later built at Penkridge itself. By the 1830s boats were calling several times daily, linking Penkridge to a waterway network that extended across almost the whole country. In 1837, the Grand Junction Railway was opened, carried over the River Penk by the fine seven- arched Penkridge Viaduct, designed by Joseph Locke and built by Thomas Brassey. It cut through Penkridge on its west side, along the edge of the church yard, where the station was built. Like the canal, the railway also had a stop at Spread Eagle (although Gailey station has since closed), and it began with two trains daily in each direction, to Stafford and Wolverhampton. The canal and railway carried both finished goods and raw materials as well as passengers, and must have played a major part in the town's prosperity. In the early stages of the industrial revolution, iron working along the Penk and its tributaries received a stimulus, making iron the town's main industry for a time. As early as 1590 Edward Littleton (d. 1610) was looking for a suitable place for a furnace and there was an iron foundry at Penkridge by 1635. In the early 18th century, a forge at Congreve was turning out 120 tons a year, and in the 1820s the mill below Bull Bridge was used for rolling iron. However, this industry tailed off as the Black Country ironworks outstripped it in output and beat it on price. Thereafter, extractive industries came to the fore. By the mid-19th century, the Littletons were operating quarries at Wolgarston, Wood Bank, and Quarry Heath,VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.1. as well as a sand pit at Hungry Hill, Teddesley, and a brickyard in Penkridge.The National Archives, Estate D260/M/E The fortunes of the town and the Littletons remained intertwined throughout the Georgian and Victorian ages. Sir Edward Littleton, 4th Baronet, who succeeded in 1742, completed his family's dominance of the parish by buying Penkridge manor from the Earl of Warwick in 1749. He soon began work on a new and more impressive seat for the family: Teddesley Hall, north-west of Penkridge, on Teddesley Hay.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5: 23: s.2: The Hay This was built on the site of Teddesley Lodge, a smaller house that had earlier accommodated junior members of the Littleton family. It was said that the finance came from large hoards of coins discovered behind panels at Pillaton Hall, which raised the vast sum of ¬£15,000 on sale. The new house was large but austere, a three-storied, square, brick structure, with seven windows on the upper storeys on all four faces. The main building was linked by curved screen walls to flanking ranges, one housing stables, the other kitchens, stores and servants' rooms. The fourth baronet was long-lived, surviving until 1812, although, his wife, Frances Horton, died childless in 1781. In his later life, he represented Staffordshire in Parliament, siding with the Whigs, who were mainly in opposition during that period, and achieving some distinction, but he never remarried. However, he did secure the succession by adopting his great-nephew, Edward Walhouse, as his heir. Walhouse took the name Littleton and inherited the Littleton estates, although not the Littleton baronetcy. He also took on his great-uncle's constituency, and he was to achieve far greater eminence as a politician than any previous or subsequent member of the family. Joining the liberal Canningite wing of the Tory party, he campaigned prominently for Catholic Emancipation. When George Canning died in 1827, Littleton went over to the Whigs. He was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland by the Whig Prime Minister Grey in 1833. Ultimately he was to find that he could not sacrifice his principles for political gain: having made promises he could not keep to the Irish leader, Daniel O'Connell, he resigned his post. However, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hatherton, a title which remains with the head of the Littleton family to the present. Hatherton married Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley, illegitimate daughter of Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, and thus a niece of the Iron Duke. After a long life, he left an heir: Edward Littleton, 2nd Baron Hatherton, another Liberal politician. However, even the title of the baronage makes clear that the Littleton family now had holdings and interests far wider than Penkridge. Hatherton was historically an exclave of Wolverhampton, but became a separate parish in the mid-19th century. The Littletons had a house there as well as land, but they owned a great deal more in Cannock, Walsall and other parts of Staffordshire. In fact, the first baron had brought about a decisive shift in the family's economic activities. As the heir to a large fortune from the Walhouse family and a successful businessman himself, he had large land and mineral holdings in the Cannock and Walsall areas. The Littleton estates were a part, albeit an important part, of a wider portfolio. The National Archives list the following property interests of the 1st Baron Hatherton in 1862, a year before his death: * Teddesley Hall, Woods and Farm; Hatherton Hall, Pillaton Gardens, Teddesley and Hatherton Estate Rentals - all in his own occupation * 288 holdings in the following townships: Abbots Bromley, Acton Trussell, Bednall, Beaudesert and Longdon, Bosoomoor, Congreve, Coppenhall, Cannock, Drayton, Dunston, Huntington, Hatherton, Linell, Levedale, Longridge, Otherton, Pipe Ridware, Penkridge, Pillaton, Preston, Stretton, Saredon and Shareshill, Teddesley, Water Eaton, Wolgarston, Walsall Estate Rental * 236 holdings, in Walsall * Royalties from mineral extraction at Hatherton Colliery, Bloxwich; Hatherton Colliery, Great Wyrley; Serjeants Hill Colliery, Walsall; Hatherton Lime Works, Walsall; Walsall Old Lime Works; Paddock Brickyard, Walsall; Sutton Road Brickyard, Walsall; Serjeants Hill Brickyard, Walsall; Butts Brickyard, Walsall; Old Brooks Brickyard, Walsall; Long House Brickyard, Cannock; Rumer Hill Brickyard, Cannock; Penkridge Brickyard; Wolgarstone Stone Quarry, Teddesley; Wood Bank and Quarry Heath Stone Quarries, Teddesley; Gravel Pit, Huntington; Sand Pit at Hungry Hill, Teddesley. * Tithes from 579 occupiers in Hatherton, Cannock, Leacroft, Hednesford, Cannock Wood, Wyrley, Saredon, Shareshill, Penkridge, Congreve, Mitton, Whiston, Rodbaston, Coppenhall, Dunston, Bloxwich, Walsall Wood.Records of the Littleton Family of Teddesley and Hatherton, Barons Hatherton at the National Archives This is a formidable list and it shows clearly that the Littleton's concerns were tipping towards their profitable mining and quarrying interests, mainly, if not entirely, outside Penkridge, although in nearby towns and villages. The occupational data in the 1881 census, which show agriculture still dominant in Penkridge, also show mining even more dominant in neighbouring Cannock, with 2881 men and 17 women mine and quarry workersCannock Occupational Orders, 1881 Census at a Vision of Britain through Time edited by Matthew Woollard (History Data Service, UK Data Archive, University of Essex). ‚Äì the majority employed in Lord Hatherton's enterprises. Not surprisingly, Cannock's entire history contrasts strongly with its neighbours in Staffordshire. While Penkridge changed to remain stable, and Brewood declined markedly, Cannock grew very rapidly from about the middle of the 19th century. Cannock parish's population in 1851 was 3,081 ‚Äì a little less than Penkridge's. By 1881, it had risen to an astonishing 17,125. Cannock was a boom town of the early Victorian period, driven forward by the voracious demand of the industrial economy for coal. Walsall was a fast-growing manufacturing centre, with money to be made from industrial property and workers' housing: it was here that the second Baron Hatherton made one of the family's largest benefactions, Walsall Arboretum, site of the former lime quarry, and where two main roads are called Littleton Street and Hatherton Street. Significantly Edward Littleton, later to become the 2nd Baron, pursued his political career as MP for the new Walsall constituency. The Littletons played a leading part in this phase of the Industrial Revolution and made large profits from it, and this tilted their attention increasingly away from their landed estates. Meanwhile, agriculture remained in the doldrums, with the Long Depression of the late Victorian period driving down farm incomes and rents and hastening migration to the industrial towns. The 20th century brought little relief, with only the World Wars giving temporary boosts to agriculture. The land tax proposals of the People's Budget of 1909 were dropped, but it was a warning to large landowners what was to come. Not surprisingly, those who were able to do so got out of land. In 1919, the 3rd Lord Hatherton disposed of large estates in the Penkridge area: over of the deanery estate; Congreve House and in Congreve (probably former prebendal property); in Lower Drayton; in Upper Drayton; in Gailey, including the Spread Eagle Inn; in Levedale; and in Longridge. In many cases, farms were sold to their tenants.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.2 - Manors The nationalisation of the coal industry in 1946 severed the main link between the family and the area. In 1947 the 4th Lord Hatherton sold some of the land at Teddesley Hay. In 1953, he completed the process, selling over at Penkridge and 2,976 in Teddesley Hay, including Teddesley Hall,VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5: 23: s.2: The Hay the family seat. The long dominance not only of the Littleton family, but of the landed gentry as a class, had finally come to an end. The modern town Penkridge in the 20th and 21st centuries has followed a double track, on the one hand evolving into a residential centre, like many fringing the West Midlands conurbation, on the other remaining a market town and commercial centre of considerable importance. The residential evolution began shortly after the coming of the railway, with the development of the St. Michael's Road area on the western edge of Penkridge: large Victorian houses with large gardens, accommodating middle-class families which probably earned a living in Stafford, Wolverhampton or even Birmingham.VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.1. The main Stafford-Wolverhampton road was greatly improved between the wars, with large parts turned into a dual carriageway. The impact was felt first at Gailey, where two stages of widening in 1929 and 1937 took out parts of the churchyard and resulted in the demolition of the original Spread Eagle Inn. The widening work between 1932 and 1934 brought a major reshaping of Penkridge itself. Early-19th-century coachmen considered the Penkridge section the most difficult between London and Liverpool because of its narrowness. The widening swept away up to 30 houses, many of them medieval, on the east side of Clay Street, together with the old George and Fox Inn and a square called Stone Cross on its west side. Initially, this was most important for the improved flow of commercial traffic: after World War II, with greatly increased availability and use of motor cars, it made Penkridge much more viable as a home for workers employed in the conurbation or the county town. The war itself brought further changes. The old common lands between the Penk and the Cannock Road were used as a military camp during the war years. This eased their subsequent development as a large housing estate, greatly enlarging the size and population of Penkridge in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1951 and 1961 the population grew from 2,518 to 3,383 ‚Äì a rise of over 34% in just ten years.Penkridge: Total Population at A Vision of Britain Through time Improvements in communications continued to drive the economy of the town. The M6 motorway came around Stafford in 1962, running north‚Äìsouth between Penkridge and Wolgarston. More importantly, there were junctions just north of Penkridge, at Dunston, and south-east, near Gailey. This gave the town much faster access to the conurbation beyond Wolverhampton, as well as to Stoke-on-Trent, Manchester and the north. The M6 linked to the M1 motorway in 1971 and the long-awaited M54 motorway, shadowing the ancient Watling Street opened in 1983, greatly improving links with Telford, Shrewsbury and much of Wales. Penkridge was now very favourably placed on a truly national motorway network. Since the arrival of the M6, the population has more than doubled, as new houses have spread along all the roads, particularly north and south along the A449..VCH: Staffordshire: Volume 5:16.s.1. Penkridge has remained a substantial commercial and shopping centre. The major supermarket chains have not been allowed to open stores in the town and its only large store is a Co-operative supermarket. Independent shops, caf√©s, inns and services occupy the area between the old market place to the east and Stone Cross on the A449 to the west. The area between Pinfold Lane and the river, long the site of livestock sales, has emerged as a new market place, attracting large numbers of visitors to Penkridge on market days.

Early development Bridge of former PD&O; line over a farm track, somewhere between Dungannon and Pomeroy, Co. Tyrone. The disused embankment has been partly removed. Building of the PD&O; line started from Portadown in 1855 and reached Dungannon in 1858. This first section of line opened with temporary termini at both Portadown and Dungannon. At Dungannon the delay was in order to build a half-mile tunnel because Viscount Northland objected to smoky locomotives traversing his land. In due course the PD&O; succeeded in gaining access to the Ulster Railway's Portadown station and in 1861 opened for traffic not only Dungannon Tunnel but also the remainder of the route to Omagh, where it formed a junction with the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway. In so doing it completed the railway route between Portadown and Derry that came to be informally known as the \\"Derry Road\\". Besides Dungannon Tunnel, the PD&O;'s most significant engineering features were an iron lattice viaduct over the River Blackwater and the fact that west of the line reached a summit of , the highest elevation of any Irish gauge railway in Ireland. The contractor to build the PD&O; was William Dargan, who in 1860 sold a 999-year lease of the line to the Ulster Railway. In 1876 the Ulster merged with the Irish North Western Railway and the Northern Railway of Ireland to form the Great Northern Railway (GNR). Heyday and decline Road bridge over filled- in cutting of PD&O; line, somewhere between Dungannon and Pomeroy, Co. Tyrone. The GNR opened a branch line from to Cookstown in 1879. This turned out to be the only branch line that had a junction with the PD&O; route. The PD&O; gave the GNR a direct route between and , competing with the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway's northerly route between and Londonderry Waterside via . The B&NCR; line was shorter, had better gradients and was faster, and so attracted the majority of passenger traffic between the two cities. However, the GNR route attracted more goods traffic between the two cities plus passenger and goods traffic from the market towns along the route. Dargan had the PD&O; line built as single track, but traffic became sufficient for the GNR to install double track between Portadown and in 1899‚Äì1902 and between Dungannon and in 1905‚Äì06. After the First World War, increasing road competition reversed this position and the GNR reverted the Dungannon ‚Äî Donaghmore section to single track after 1932. In order to reduce operating costs the GNR pioneered the development and use of railbuses, and on lines including the PD&O; it opened numerous wayside halts for them to serve. It also pioneered the development and use of railcars, and in the 1950s it introduced a fleet of BUT units whose work included \\"Derry Road\\" trains over the PD&O.; The GNR Board cut the Cookstown branch back to Coalisland in 1956. In 1957 the Government of Northern Ireland made the GNRB close almost all of its lines near the border including the Omagh ‚Äî Enniskillen section of the L&ER;, but the \\"Derry Road\\" was kept open. The PD&O; gained a little traffic from these closures, as trains carrying pilgrims from Dublin Amiens Street to St Patrick's Purgatory on Lough Derg could no longer use the Irish North Western Railway route via to Pettigo but had to take the longer route via Portadown to Omagh. But the PD&O; lost more trade than it gained, as traffic such as cattle exports from the west of the Republic switched to exporting through the Port of Dublin instead of using the GNR to reach north-eastern ports such as Belfast. Final years and closure In May 1958 the Northern Ireland Government initiated the GNR Board's dissolution and partition between the two states, and its remaining lines in Northern Ireland passed to the Ulster Transport Authority. In 1959 the UTA closed the Dungannon ‚Äî Coalisland section of the Cookstown branch and reduced the PD&O; between Portadown and Trew and Moy to single track. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the \\"Derry Road\\" including the PD&O; on 15 February 1965. Reopening proposals In the 2010s there has been a proposal to reopen the Dungannon ‚Äì Portadown section of the PD&O.; In January 2013 Northern Ireland's Department of Regional Development published a public consultation document proposing that it could be reopened for an estimated ¬£187 million. This was followed in May 2014 by Regional Development minister Danny Kennedy publishing a Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy for 2015‚Äì35 that proposes railway reopenings, including Dungannon ‚Äì Portadown.

Instead the band recorded a new version of the album in Costa Mesa, CA with Mike McHugh at his Distillery Recording Studio, to get a more lo-fi sound. Chinese Fountain, their new \\"more grown up, well polished\\" album was released September 23, 2014. This album was produced by JP Plunier at Seahorse Studios in Los Angeles, CA. While touring the album, the band expanded their live band with percussionist Nick Murray.YouTube ~ the Growlers (Live on KEXP) The band's fifth studio album, City Club was released by Cult Records on September 30, 2016, while they embarked on a supporting tour in the same month. It was the first Growlers album to be credited solely to Brooks Nielsen and Matt Taylor, as opposed to the whole band. Nielsen and Taylor wrote and recorded demos for the album over a span of 2 to 3 months with the help of Kyle Mullarky at his studio in Topanga Canyon, CA. It was preceded by the title track as a single produced by Julian Casablancas, who also owns the label. Neither drummer Scott Montoya nor bass player Anthony Perry feature on the album.https://www.allmusic.com/album/city-club- mw0002976520/credits On September 25, the band confirmed Montoya's departure from the band and stated that Perry was set to return in the near future. The band toured for this album with Brad Bowers on bass, Adam Wolcott Smith on keyboard, and Richard Gowen on drums. Whether their membership in the band is permanent is currently unclear. The band released Casual Acquaintances on July 27, 2018, a collection of demos and unused material from the City Club sessions. The Growlers have toured with artists such as The Black Keys, Devendra Banhart, Julian Casablancas, Night Beats, and Jonathan Richman. They have also appeared at numerous festivals including Coachella, Bonnaroo, Primavera Sound, Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Sasquatch!, Wakarusa, Treasure Island, Fun Fun Fun, Bestival, Way Out West, End of The Road, Burgerama III, Rock in Rio and Outside Lands. =Beach Goth= The band has organized their annual Beach Goth festival since 2012. The event typically features performances by bands representing a variety of genres, including pop, rap, hip hop, heavy metal, and rock. Over the years, the event has included costume contests, amusement park rides, and live performances of Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Growlers have headlined both Saturday and Sunday night of the annual Beach Goth festival since its inception. The likes of Die Antwoord, Grimes, Gucci Mane, Julian Casablancas, Mac DeMarco, The Drums, Foxygen, White Arrows and Ghost B.C. have appeared at the festival. Beach Goth 4 (October 2015) was hosted by Pauly Shore and featured live performances of Rocky Horror Picture Show throughout the weekend as well as a performance of The Doors song \\"People Are Strange\\" by The Growlers and Julian Casablancas. The 2016 edition of Beach Goth took place at The Observatory in Santa Ana, CA on October 23‚Äì24, 2016. It was originally scheduled to take place at the Oak Canyon Park but was moved last minute due to unexplained circumstances. The festival's lineup included Bon Iver, TLC, James Blake, 2 Live Crew, Violent Femmes, Future Islands, Reel Big Fish, The Faint, the Pharcyde, Left√∂ver Crack, and DJ Quik. While it was hailed a success, the outdoor festival suffered from rain and resultant street flooding. This caused the Growlers to delay their own set due to equipment damage. In the aftermath, the band issued an apology. Due to an ongoing lawsuit with Noise Group (owners of The Observatory venue) over the Beach Goth trademark, 2017's festival took on the name \\"The Growlers Six\\", which took place on October 28 & 29 at the LA Waterfront. The festival included artists such as the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Modest Mouse, and the Butthole Surfers. The Growlers returned to their trademarked \\"Beach Goth\\" brand name for the 7th annual festival, taking place at the Los Angeles Historic State Park on August 5, 2018. Beach Goth 7 hosted performances by The Growlers, Jonathan Richman, The Voidz, The Drums, La Luz, and GWAR. = Allegations of misconduct = In July 2020, allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against the band, along with other artists associated with Burger Records and the Southern California surf and garage rock music scene. Arrow De Wilde, the lead singer of the L.A. rock band Starcrawler, shared a personal encounter on her Instagram.https://www.instagram.com/arrowdewilde/ In her post, Arrow claims she was assaulted by a male stripper hired by The Growlers while they were on tour together in Australia. In a statement issued via Instagram on July 31, 2020, Growlers singer Brooks Nielsen took \\"full responsibility and accountability for the behavior of all Growlers' band members, past and present,\\" and announced that Matt Taylor would temporarily leave the band. Additionally, former Growlers touring keyboardist Adam Wolcott Smith admitted to an incident of abuse on his Instagram, while on tour with his band Zen Mother.

Ronald (born 1961) is an American plant pathologist and geneticist. She is a professor in the Genome Center and the Department of Plant Pathology, and founding director of the Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy (IFAL), at the University of California, Davis. She also serves as Key Scientist at the Joint BioEnergy Institute in Emeryville, California. In 2018 she served as a visiting professor at Stanford University in the Center on Food Security and the Environment. Her laboratory has genetically engineered rice for resistance to diseases and tolerance to flooding, which are serious problems of rice crops in Asia and Africa. Ronald's research has been published in Science, Nature and other leading peer-reviewed scientific journals, and has also been featured in The New York Times, Organic Gardening Magazine, Forbes Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Progressive Farmer, CNN, Discover Magazine, The Scientist, Popular Mechanics, Bill Gates blog, National Public Radio and National Geographic. Early life and education Pamela Ronald was born in 1961 to Patricia (n√©e Fobes) and Robert Ronald of San Mateo, California. Robert Ronald, a Jewish refugee who was born Robert Rosenthal, wrote a memoir entitled \\"Last Train to Freedom\\". From an early age, Ronald spent time backpacking in the Sierra Nevada wilderness, sparking her love for plant biology. Ronald realized that analyzing and studying plants could be a profession after witnessing botanists in the field during a summer time hike with her brother. She already knew she loved plants after time spent helping her mother tend to them in the garden. As a student at Reed College with Helen Stafford (1922‚Äì2011), Ronald became intrigued by the interactions of plants with other organisms. For her senior thesis, she studied the recolonization of Mount St. Helens. Ronald received a B.A. in Biology from Reed College in 1982. She went on to earn an M.A. in Biology from Stanford University in 1984 and an M.S. from Uppsala University, Sweden in plant physiology in 1985. As a Fulbright Scholar in Sweden she visited Nils Fries and studied how plants interact with mycorrhizal fungi. As a graduate student at UC Berkeley, she began to study plant-bacterial interactions in the laboratory of Brian Staskawicz, working with peppers and tomatoes. Because rice is the most important food staple in the world, she switched her studies to rice, hoping to contribute to the well-being of farmers in impoverished regions of the world. She received her Ph.D. in molecular and physiological plant biology in 1990. She was a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University from 1990‚Äì1992 in the laboratory of Steven Tanksley. In 1996 she married Raoul Adamchak, an organic farmer. They have two children, Cliff and Audrey. Career and research Speaking at the March for Science San Francisco, April 2017 In 1992, Ronald joined UC Davis as a faculty member. From 2003‚Äì2007 Ronald chaired the UC Davis Distinguished Women in Science seminar series, an event designed to support women's professional advancement in the sciences. She served as Faculty Assistant to the Provost from 2004‚Äì2007. In addition to being a professor in the Genome Center and the Department of Plant Pathology at UC Davis, Ronald is the founding director of the Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy (IFAL) at the University of California, Davis. She also serves as Key Scientist at the Joint BioEnergy Institute in Emeryville, California. Ronald is a vocal advocate for science and for sustainable agriculture. Her laboratory has been instrumental in the development of rice that is disease-resistant and flood-tolerant. =Xa21: Pattern recognition receptor-mediated immunity= The Ronald laboratory studies the innate immune response, using the host organism rice and the agriculturally important pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In the 1990s, through conversations with rice geneticist Gurdev Khush, Ronald became interested in the rice XA21 genetic locus, which conferred broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo.Ikeda R et al. 1990. A new resistance gene to bacterial blight derived from O. longistaminata. Jap. J. Breed, 280-281Khush G.S. et al. 1990. A new gene for resistance to bacterial blight from O. longistaminata. Rice Genetics Newsletter, 121-122 She hypothesized that Xa21 encoded a single protein that recognized a conserved microbial determinant. In 1995, the Ronald laboratory isolated and characterized the rice XA21 pattern recognition receptor. Subsequent discoveries in flies, humans, mice, and Arabidopsis revealed that animals and other plant species also carry membrane-anchored receptors with striking structural similarities to XA21 and that these receptors also play key roles in the immune response. For their discoveries of the fly and mice receptors, Jules Hoffman and Bruce Beutler received the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (jointly with Ralph Steinman), indicating the importance of such research. This work resulted in part from the identification of a blight-resistant rice strain from Mali, Oryza longistaminata, in the late 1970s. The strain was studied and bred at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Ba√±os, Philippines. Ronald's group subsequently mapped, sequenced, and cloned the Xa21 gene from this rice strain. When US patent 5859339 was granted to the University of California for the XA21 gene, Ronald and law professor John Barton established a benefit-sharing model for the source countries of genetically important plant varieties called the Genetic Resources Recognition Fund. Ronald also launched a project with CGIAR to allow noncommercial use of the gene for nonprofit purposes and released the gene to IRRI for the development of rice strains to be grown in developing nations. Dr. Ronald at Pop!Tech 2008 Paper retraction In 2009 and 2011, Ronald's laboratory reported on the discovery of a bacterial protein that they believed was the activator of Xa21-mediated immunity. These reports were described by ScienceWatch as \\"hot\\" and \\"highly cited\\". In 2013, Ronald retracted both scientific papers, notifying the scientific community that two bacterial strains, Ax21 and RaxSt, had been confused. The error was discovered when new laboratory members Rory Pruitt and Benjamin Schwessinger were unable to replicate previous results. As a result, the laboratory carried out a lengthy and painstaking process, re- confirming the genotypes of all the laboratory strains in their collection. Examination of the bacterial strains and rice seed stocks indicated that one of the bacterial strains involved in key experiments had been mislabeled. Researchers also discovered that results of one of the tests that had been performed were highly variable. In a blog post at Scientific American, Ronald describes the 18-month process leading to the retraction. The retractions were also reported on by The Scientist. Retraction watch, a website that shines light on problems with papers and educates and celebrates research ethics and good practices stated, \\"that this was a case of scientists doing the right thing\\". As part of a story about the importance of setting the record straight, in 2014, Nature magazine also covered the Ronald retraction.  RaxX as a mediator of Xa21  For two more years Ronald's laboratory repeated critical experiments and carried out new ones. In redoing their work, they introduced new procedures and controls to ensure that they were getting it right. Ronald reports that she was amazed not only by the perseverance and loyalty of her team, but also by the community support that she received during this difficult time. In 2015, Ronald published the discovery of the predicted ligand of XA21, a sulfated peptide called RaxX, correcting their mistake and bringing the research team full circle. =Genetic Resources Recognition Fund= Ronald has sought ways to recognize source nations and institutions that have contributed to important scientific advances, such as . Working with law professor John Barton, Ronald tried to establish a benefit- sharing model for the source countries of genetically important plant varieties. In 1996, Ronald founded the Genetic Resources Recognition Fund (GRRF) at UC Davis. The intention of the fund was to collect payments from the licensing of academic discoveries that utilized plant materials from developing countries, and to redistribute those monies to source countries through fellowships, land conservation efforts, or other projects of benefit to nation partners. =Sub1: Tolerance to abiotic stress= In 1996, Ronald began a project with rice breeder David Mackill who had recently demonstrated that tolerance to complete submergence mapped to the Submergence tolerance 1 (Sub1) Quantitative trait locus (QTL). In 1997, the USDA awarded Ronald and Mackill a grant to isolate the Sub1 locus. Ronald‚Äôs laboratory led the positional cloning of the Sub1 QTL, revealed that it carried three ethylene response transcription factors (ERF) and demonstrated that one of the ERFs, which she designated Sub1A, was upregulated rapidly in response to submergence and conferred robust tolerance to submergence in transgenic plants . This work revealed an important mechanism with which plants control tolerance to abiotic stress and set the stage for in-depth molecular-genetic analyses of Sub1A-mediated processes with her collaborator Julia Bailey-Serres, who joined the project in 2003. Mackill‚Äôs team at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) generated and released several Sub1A varieties (developed through marker-assisted breeding) in seven countries including India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, where submergence destroys four million tons of rice each year, enough to feed 30 million people. With support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sub1 rice has reached over six million farmers as of 2017. Public engagement 420x420px Ronald co-authored the book Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food with her husband, Raoul Adamchak. Tomorrow's Table was selected as one of the best books of 2008 by Seed Magazine and the Library Journal. Bill Gates calls the book \\"a fantastic piece of work\\" and \\"important for anyone that wants to learn about the science of seeds and challenges faced by farmers.\\" This book describes new ideas about genetically engineered crops, helpful tips about crop production in general, and evidence for why genetically engineered crops are hard to consistently produce. Ronald talks about the importance of organic farming while also explaining that genetically engineered crops are also a good option if organic farming fails. In addition to her scholarly publications, Ronald has written for The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Forbes Magazine, Scientific American, The Harvard International Review, The Economist, the Boston review and the MIT Technology Review. The song \\"Sierra Bound\\", from Rita Hosking's 2013 CD Little Boat, is dedicated to Pamela Ronald. Awards and honors Ronald was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2019 and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2006. She and her colleagues have received a number of awards for their work on submergence tolerant rice. They were recipients of the USDA National Research Initiative Discovery Award in 2008, and finalists for the World Technology Award for Environment in 2009.

It is now known as the Vistula Bay or Vistula Gulf. The modern German name, Frisches Haff, is derived from an earlier form, Friesisches Haff.Erhard Riemann, Alfred Schoenfeldt, Ulrich Tolksdorf, Reinhard Goltz, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (Germany), Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, Preussisches W√∂rterbuch: Deutsche Mundarten Ost- und Westpreussens, 6th edition, Wachholtz, 1974, p.595, Geography The lagoon is a mouth of a few branches of the Vistula River, notably the Nogat, and of the Pregolya River. It is connected to Gda≈Ñsk Bay by the Strait of Baltiysk. The Poland‚ÄìRussia border runs across the lagoon. Localities on the lagoon include Kaliningrad, Baltiysk, and Primorsk in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and ElblƒÖg, Tolkmicko, Frombork, Krynica Morska in Poland. The Polish port of ElblƒÖg used to see a substantial amount of trading traffic on the lagoon, but that has declined owing to the current border situation. Kaliningrad and Baltiysk are currently major seaports on the lagoon. It is an endangered Important Bird Area of Poland.Vistula Lagoon, a fact sheet of BirdLife International Etymology The earliest version of the name of Vistula Lagoon has been recorded in historical sources by Wulfstan, an Anglo-Saxon sailor and merchant at the end of the 9th Century as Estmere.Janet Batley, Wulfstan's voyage and his description of Estland: the text and the language of the text, in: Wulfstan's Voyage. The Baltic Sea region in the early Viking Age as seen from shipboard, Maritime Culture of the North, 2, Roskilde 2009, p. 15. It is an Anglo-Saxon translation of Old Prussian name for the lagoon - *Aƒ´stinmari (modern Lithuanian - Aistmarƒós) derived from (OP - Old Prussian) Aistei - \\"Aestii\\" etc. and (OP) *mari - \\"lagoon (a body of water cut off from a larger body by a reef of sand), fresh water bay\\".Mikkels Klussis, Dictionary of revived Prussian: Prussian - English, English - Prussian, Vilnus 2005/06, p. 47. So the oldest known meaning of the name of Vistula Lagoon was \\"The lagoon or sea of the Aesti\\". Over three hundred years later, in the first half of the 13th Century, the name of Vistula Lagoon occurs in deeds issued by Teutonic Order in Latin version as Mare Recens (1246 - \\"mare\\" - a pool or lake or sea and \\"recens\\" - fresh) in contrast to the contemporary name for the Baltic Sea - Mare Salsum (Salty Sea). Then in 1251 we find record about Mare Recens et Neriam (Frisches Haff and Frische Nehrung, now Vistula Spit) and finally in 1288 Recenti Mari Hab (Haff) which as one can see corresponds with later German \\"Frisches Haff\\" = \\"Fresh Lagoon\\".Codex diplomaticus Warmiensis oder Regesten und Urkunden zur Geschichte Ermlands. Bd. 1, Urkunden der Jahre 1231-1340, (ed.) Johann Martin Saage, Carl Peter Woelky, Mainz 1860, No. 13, p. 18 - 22, No. 26, p. 46 - 49, No. 79, p. 133 - 136. Proposed canal Digging a canal to connect the lagoon with the Baltic Sea is in consideration as a major EU-supported project. The canal, would re- activate the ElblƒÖg river port. It would also free its dependence on Russia, which occasionally revokes the right of passage for Polish ships through the Strait of Baltiysk as a form of pressure on Polish authorities. In October 2016 details of the project were confirmed by PiS leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski. The long, 80 metres wide and 5 metres deep canal shall be completed by 2020 at an estimated cost of PLN 880 million. However, major ecological considerations stand in the way. For example, mammal migration along the lagoon could be disrupted. Also, the inflow of brackish waters from the Baltic sea could result in serious unbalancing of the lagoon's freshwater ecosystem.  History  East Prussian refugees after crossing the lagoon From 1772 until 1918, the lagoon was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which had become part of the German Empire in 1871. Between 1920 and 1946 it was split between Germany and the Free City of Danzig. At present state since 1945 its eastern part belongs to Russia (formerly USSR), Poland has 43.8% of its area at lagoon's western side. The bordering administrative regions is Polish Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and modern Russian Kaliningrad Oblast. =Kursenieki= Curonian-populated area in 1649 While today the Kursenieki, also known as Kur≈°ininkai are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kur≈°ininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipƒóda) to Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), including the area around the Vistula Lagoon. The Kur≈°ininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur≈°ininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped. = Historical events related to lagoon = From January until March 1945 throughout the Evacuation of East Prussia, refugees from East Prussia crossed the frozen lagoon on their way to the west after the Red Army had reached the coast of the lagoon near Elbing on January 26. Attacked by Soviet aircraft, thousands of these refugees were killed or fell through the broken ice.

He designed many devices to help people with disabilities including a Sip-and-puff communication system, and a robot arm called M.O.M (Manipulative Obedient Machine). In his life, Cameron was awarded many honors for his work with persons with disabilities. Born October 11, 1924 in California, Cameron moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada where he spent his childhood. When World War II broke out, he immediately signed up at CFB Petawawa. Unfortunately, once there he developed a sinus condition and it was decided that it would be too cold for him in Europe. He was given a medical discharge. Having dual citizenship, Cameron then joined the U.S. Marine Corps to fight in the Pacific. He served overseas during the war as well as in post-war Japan. Upon his return to Canada, Cameron enrolled in the engineering program at the University of Saskatchewan but engineering did not feel like a good fit. After an aptitude test it was decided that Cameron would be perfect for the newly created industrial design program. In 1948 he moved to Los Angeles, enrolled at UCLA through the G.I. Bill, and completed his degree in 1950. Cameron held many interesting positions throughout his career. During his time at UCLA he worked part-time designing motors for U.S. Motors Company. He worked there full-time for about a year after graduating. He was hired by Hughes Aircraft as a designer in 1951 and in 1952 he was sent to Mojave Air Force base to work on a security project. In 1955 he created his own industrial design company. Among the highlights of his company was the creation of the Nest-a-bin liquid shipping container for Kaiser Aluminum and a design for a sliding door handle used in the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle. He spent a number of years in Iiyama, Japan where he designing the first honeycomb fiberglass skis, which were used by Yuichiro Miura to ski down Mount Everest in 1970. Upon returning to North America, Cameron and his family settled in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Cameron was hired to work at the TRIUMF cyclotron at the University of British Columbia to design remote handling tools for radioactive experiments. In December 1980 Cameron's relative, Neil Squire, was involved in a motor vehicle accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to speak. With an old teletype machine, Cameron put his engineering background to use and designed the \\"sip-and-puff\\" system that allowed Squire to communicate. By \\"sipping and puffing\\" in Morse code, Squire's words were made visible on a screen. From these efforts, the Neil Squire Society's first program, Computer Comfort, was born. Cameron continued to work with Squire and other people with disabilities, teaching them to use computers to increase their independence. He was soon aided by a group of dedicated volunteers, and in 1984, after the death of Squire, this group was named the Neil Squire Foundation. The foundation was later renamed the Neil Squire Society and has since gone on to help thousands of persons with disabilities increase their independence. Cameron was diagnosed with stomach cancer in October 1990. Though he was told he only had three months to live, he continued to work with the foundation until his death on March 13, 1993. Awards and honours In 1994, Cameron was posthumously inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame.

They evolved the plot together. Plot Taxi driver Hartmut Mackowiak (Elmar Wepper) is a seasoned man who has grown fond of firm habits and attitudes as it is not unusual for a man of his age. He shows no other ambitions than to do his job properly and to speak his mind. Mackowiak is no family man because his wife Christa (Katja Rup√©) abandoned him and now he lives alone. One day a Turkish business woman becomes his passenger when she visits her mother in Nuremberg. She has her six-year-old daughter Hayat (Mercan T√ºrkoƒülu) with her because the child is supposed to get to know her grandmother (√ñzay Fecht) who lives in Germany. Mackowiak makes an impression on Hayat who is soon after left in grandmother's care while Hayat's mother goes abroad. Unfortunately grandmother is no longer up to the task of caring for a little child. Hayat feels that she is on her own when her grandmother suffers a stroke. Wondering to whom she could turn, the grumpy taxi driver comes to her mind. Mackowiak is downright flabbergasted when he realises that she seems to consider his taxi her refuge and that she's thinking \\"Nazi\\" was his name because she overheard her mother calling him that. However, he then also realises little by little he is neither too old to make new friends nor unable to learn to look at his world from a hitherto unknown point of view. Thus he even finds a new approach to his wife. Reception The film had friendly reviews and entered the Top Ten of German box office charts.

The following day, the Bengals re-signed Still to the practice squad to help him pay for his daughter's cancer treatment.Cincinnati Bengals Re-Sign Devon Still to Help Pay for Daughter's Cancer Treatment In addition to his daughter Leah's diagnosis, Still was also attempting to heal from a hamstring injury. He admitted that the injury was holding him back from his full ability and he could not give his best effort to his team. Consequently, Still did not make the Cincinnati Bengal's 53-man roster. Still said: \\"I completely understand where they were coming from....\\"I can't give football 100 percent right now. In the business aspect they want guys to solely focus on football, which is understandable. We are here to win this city a Super Bowl and right now I am not in a position where I can give football 100 percent of everything I have.\\" Head coach Marvin Lewis offered Still a position on the practice squad so that he could continue to pay for his daughter's cancer treatments. As a member of the practice squad, Still did not have to travel with the team on road trips. On September 10, 2014, it was announced that Still would be moved to the active roster. In the game that followed, the Bengals' second of the season, he recorded three tackles against the Atlanta Falcons.http://prod.static.bengals.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/weekly- releases/2014/reg-week-3/week-3-bengals.pdf On September 5, 2015, Still was waived by the Bengals. =Houston Texans= On January 6, 2016, the Houston Texans signed Still to a reserve future contract.http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2016/01/texans-sign-defensive- tackle-devon-still-to-reserve-future-deal/ He was placed on injured reserve on October 5, 2016. =New York Jets= On August 4, 2017, Still signed with the New York Jets.

Sports is not more important than me being there while my daughter is fighting for her life.\\" Since the June 2, 2014 diagnosis, Still spent the next three weeks sleeping next to his daughter at the hospital despite his own recent back surgery. In support of his daughter, Still shaved his head bald and has said that he will grow back his hair only when Leah's does. The Bengals demonstrated their loyalty even further by permitting Devon Still's jersey to be sold in order to raise awareness for pediatric cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. $400,000 sales were made in four days. At the end of September, it was reported that Still's jersey donation sales neared $1 million. The New Orleans Saints head coach, Sean Payton bought 100 jerseys and distributed them to the local Boys & Girls Club and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. On September 25, 2014, before driving Leah to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for cancer surgery, Still posted a video to his Instagram account, which went viral. Still later tweeted that the tumor and lymph nodes were removed. On October 5, 2014, during a game with the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, a music video was shown on the stadium's video screen featuring Still's daughter.

It is affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York City, and also with the \\"Occupy\\" movement in the United States and around the world. A series of meetings that were titled \\"The General Assembly\\" or \\"GA\\" were held to plan the beginning of the event on October 6, 2011, and were held to create a consensus on policies and planning for the occupation. Until April 2012, Occupy Las Vegas had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Background and history The original intent of Occupy Las Vegas, as with many of the other Occupy movements, was to denounce the role that large corporations had in promulgating the financial crisis. The protesters in Las Vegas, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the \\"99 percent.\\" This statement comes from the fact that 1% of the population owns 44% of the wealth in the United States. One of the features the Occupy Las Vegas Event had at the beginning was that the occupation began progressing with little interference from the police and the city government. The organizers and occupiers had been mainly cooperative with the police, and some of the protesters had expressed appreciation for the role that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has played during the occupation. Events related to the schism in Occupy Las Vegas On November 3, a literal midnight meeting was held at \\"Area 99\\" which purported to create a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation named Opportunities Las Vegas, and reduced the rules for voting in the General Assembly to a simple majority. On November 5, a member of the non- profit Board of Directors stated that because of differences of opinion amongst the group that he would refuse to recognize the General Assembly's authority to in any way affect the rules of the Non-Profit due to the legal requirements and ramifications of administrating a Non-Profit. There was a theft of passwords off an unprotected computer, in which the passwords for the Go Daddy domain name OccupyLasVegas.org, was briefly pointed to an anti- Semitic hate site by an unknown party. In the aftermath of this incident, the owner of the server where the site data was stored obtained a new URL, OccupyLV.org on his own initiative. When the original domain was restored a new hosted site was attached to it, on the initiative of the domain name owner. As of November 20, the two sides agreed on little, except that they were now separate organizations, both claiming to be \\"Occupy Las Vegas.\\". Chronology of events =Week 1 (October 6‚Äì12)= On October 6, 2011, Occupy Las Vegas sponsored and led a march on the Las Vegas Strip. It was estimated that 1000 people participated in this march. =Week 2 (October 13‚Äì19)= On October 15, 2011, a march was held in the Fremont Street Experience. Over 1000 people participated in the march. =Week 3 (October 20‚Äì26)= On October 21, 2011, the group began occupying a 2.5 acre site near UNLV, formerly used as an overflow parking lot by the nearby airport. The site has been informally dubbed \\"Area 99,\\" a reference both to the \\"We are the 99%\\" slogan of the overall movement, and the infamous Area 51 located in Nevada. It also has an alternate name of \\"Camp Peace.\\" =Week 4 (October 27 ‚Äì November 3)= On October 30, 2011, a zombie march was held on the Las Vegas Strip. =Week 5 (November 4 ‚Äì November 10)= See section above on Schism =Week 6 (November 11 ‚Äì November 17)= Members of both factions of OLV came together to assist a small business on the verge of being foreclosed upon, on November 13‚Äì14, 2011. In conjunction with a call by Occupy Wall Street for a protest on November 17, members of the Occupy Las Vegas factions organized a protest at the Lloyd George Federal Building. Protesters occupied the northbound lanes of Las Vegas Boulevard, resulting in 21 arrests. The arrests are a first among Occupy Las Vegas demonstrations.

Plot summary  A Chicago newspaper man, Larry Doyle, finds himself in St. Louis after a night of drunken revelry. Low on money, he sees a young woman, Anne Olgivie, at a coffee counter. She hasn't got enough money to cover her bill, so he surreptitiously pays for her. Later, after sending a telegram to his boss asking for funds, Larry sees Anne again, trying to send a wire to her mother for money to come home. Unable to pay for the message, she leaves, and Larry recovers her note. Exiting to the street, he thinks he sees Anne throw herself in front of a car, so he grabs her, making it look as if she embraces him wildly. He admits to her that he is broke and that he knows she is, as well. They take a suite in a Hotel, pretending to be on their honeymoon and try to raise some money. After being revealed to the hotel manager, Larry receives fifty dollars from his coworkers, which gives them some time. Larry attempts to get a job with a local paper because he has a line on the Eel, a local gangster. But his boss in Chicago denies his identity. Again out of money, Larry pawns a police revolver he was given as an award for solving a case in Chicago. Shortly thereafter, Larry and Anne witness a robbery by the Eel, where a police officer is killed. Larry takes the place of the getaway driver and gets the loot before driving off. The next day, Larry describes the robbery to the police, while hiding his involvement. But when the gun used is found, it turns out to be Larry's. Once the police figure out Larry's part in the robbery, he is suspected of murder. When his boss in Chicago finally admits who he is to the police, he is given twenty-four hours to find the Eel. Returning with Anne to the pawn shop, which they have worked out is the meeting place, Larry confronts the pawn broker, reveals he knows of the broker's complicity and they fight. Having knocked out the broker, Larry pretends to be him when the Eel arrives. But the Eel isn't fooled and attempts to shoot him, but is shot by Anne, instead. When the story hits the papers, Larry is worried because they all refer to Anne as \\"Mrs. Doyle\\", meaning they'll have to get married, which is fine with them both.

Gordian, on his acclamation as co-emperor with his father Gordian I (governor of the neighbouring province of Africa), ordered the replacement of Capelianus. The latter refused to go quietly, however, and took an army to Carthage, where his numerically superior and well-trained forces (Numidia, in contrast to Africa, was well-garrisoned against Berber raids) easily defeated those of Gordian. He then allowed his soldiers free rein to pillage Africa, hoping to maintain their favour in the event of an opportunity to make a bid for emperor himself. Such an opportunity presumably never arose, as we hear no more about him.Herodian, History of the Roman Empire 7.9 References Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Crisis of the Third Century Category:3rd-century Romans Category:Ancient Roman governors Category:Generals of Maximinus Thrax ","title":"Capelianus"},{"id":"33598593","title":"Cassandro"},{"id":"33598594","text":"is a Japanese professional wrestler. Trained by Emi Sakura, Makoto made her debut for her Ice Ribbon promotion in July 2006. During the next five years, Makoto went on to win Ice Ribbon's top title, the ICE√ó60 Championship, once and the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship twice, before transferring over to the Smash promotion in August 2011. She remained with Smash until March 2012, when the promotion folded. The following month, Makoto was announced as part of the roster of the new Wrestling New Classic (WNC) promotion. In March 2013, Makoto became the second WNC Women's Champion. In January 2014, Makoto made Reina Joshi Puroresu her second home promotion in addition to WNC. Reina became her primary home promotion after WNC shut down in June 2014. She is a former one-time Reina World Women's Champion and a two- time Reina World Tag Team Champion. Professional wrestling career =Ice Ribbon (2006‚Äì2011)= In February 2006, Makoto began training under Gatokunyan wrestler Emi Sakura. Two months later Sakura left Gatokunyan to form her own promotion, Ice Ribbon, taking, among others, Makoto with her. Makoto would make her wrestling debut on July 25, 2006, at Ice Ribbon's third ever show, losing to then nine-year-old Riho in a minute. Makoto's early wrestling character was based on her real-life social phobia and growing up as a hikikomori child. As is customary in Japanese professional wrestling, Makoto's first year in the business consisted of short matches and losses. Early on, Makoto also began working regularly for NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, where she represented the Sakura Ribbon-gun (\\"Sakura Ribbon Army\\"). She scored the first win of her career in NEO on February 18, 2007, pinning Tanny Mouse in a fourteen-person tag team match between the Sakura Ribbon-gun and the NEO Machine Guns-gun. She would go on to win her first title on February 1, 2008, when she teamed with her idol Etsuko Mita to defeat Tanny Mouse and Yuki Miyazaki for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. They would hold the title for five months, before losing it to the team of Chounko and Masako Takanashi. On December 23, Makoto made it to the finals of a tournament to crown the first ever ICE√ó60 Champion, before being defeated by Seina. After two unsuccessful title challenges against Kiyoko Ichiki, she would finally win the ICE√ó60 Championship on August 23, 2009, by defeating Ichiki in their third title match against each other. She would go on to lose the title to Emi Sakura on October 12, 2009. Makoto in July 2010 Makoto's 2009 was highlighted by a feud with her former partner Etsuko Mita, which built to Mita's retirement match on November 1, 2009, where she defeated Makoto. The feud with Mita also led to the evolution of Makoto's character, turning her from a weak and scared comedic character to a more serious competitor. In 2010, Makoto began making appearances for other promotions such as Kaientai Dojo, Osaka Pro Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Zero1 and Smash. On December 26 at Ribbon Mania 2010, Makoto faced Tajiri in a losing effort. In January 2011, Makoto became the leader of a stable named \\"Heisei YTR\\" (Young Traditional Revolution), which also included Chii Tomiya, Hikari Minami, Kurumi, Riho and Tsukushi. The group mainly feuded with the \\"Ichinisanshidan\\" stable, which included Hikaru Shida, Miyako Matsumoto, Mochi Miyagi, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Mika Iida, who was originally a member of Heisei YTR, but switched sides early on in the rivalry. On February 6, Makoto and Riho made it to the finals of the Ike! Ike! Ima, Ike! Ribbon Tag Tournament, before being defeated by Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto in a match that was also contested for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On March 21, Makoto had another high-profile match against a male wrestler, when she was defeated by Taka Michinoku at Ice Ribbon March 2011. During the first half of 2011, Makoto also made several appearances for Union Pro Wrestling, where she portrayed a tougher villainous character, working under the ring name Makoto-hime (\\"Princess Makoto\\") and managing Cao Zhang and Choun Shiryu during their Big China Unified Nakahara Tag Team Championship reign. Makoto, who had stated that her dream was to make it to WWE, made her American debut on July 30, 2011, when she teamed with Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey in a losing effort against the trio of Mima Shimoda, Portia Perez and Tsukasa Fujimoto at a Chikara event in Reading, Pennsylvania. The following day, Makoto was defeated by ICE√ó60 Champion Fujimoto in an \\"Ice Ribbon Showcase\\" match at the Asylum Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On August 5, it was announced that Makoto would be leaving Ice Ribbon for Smash, where she felt she had a better opportunity to reach her goal of getting to WWE. After the announcement, Makoto went on to unsuccessfully challenge Tsukasa Fujimoto for the ICE√ó60 Championship on August 7. However, six days later, Makoto and her trainer Emi Sakura defeated the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi) for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On August 21, Makoto was defeated by Sakura in her Ice Ribbon farewell match, after which the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship was vacated. =Smash (2010‚Äì2012)= Makoto made her debut for Yoshihiro Tajiri's Smash promotion on December 24, 2010, at Happening Eve, where she teamed with Isami Kodaka and Yusuke Kodama to defeat Chii Tomiya, Hikari Minami and Kushida in a six-person intergender tag team match, scoring the deciding pinfall over Tomiya. In her next Smash appearance on January 29, 2011, at Smash.13, Makoto was defeated by former WWE wrestler, Serena. After the match, Makoto was attacked by Kana, Io Shirai and Mio Shirai, the trio known as Triple Tails, who had earlier attacked another one of Tajiri's prot√©g√©s, Yusuke Kodama, after his match. The trio was eventually chased out of the ring by Tajiri. On April 30 at Smash.16, Makoto teamed with Serena and Syuri to defeat the Triple Tails in a six-woman tag team match. On May 3 at Smash.17, Makoto teamed with Tajiri in a three-way intergender tag team ladder match, contested for possession of the new Smash Championship and Smash Diva Championship belts, which had been stolen earlier by Michael Kovac. In the match, Makoto and Tajiri defeated the teams of Kovac and Lin Byron, and Hajime Ohara and Jessica Love to regain possession of the belts, which were then put up for grabs in separate tournaments. In preparation for the Smash Diva Championship tournament, Makoto, now a member of the Smash Seikigun (\\"regular army\\"), began training with the likes of Tajiri and Funaki, the latter of whom taught her a new finishing maneuver, the spear, which he had learned from Edge during his years in the WWE. Makoto entered the Smash Diva Championship tournament on July 15 at Smash.19, defeating fellow Ice Ribbon regular Chii Tomiya with the spear in just four minutes. On August 11 at Smash.20, Emi Sakura accompanied Makoto in a press conference, where she officially signed to become a full- time member of the Smash roster, finalizing her jump from Ice Ribbon. Later that same day, Makoto was eliminated from the Smash Diva Championship tournament in the semifinal stage by Serena. On September 8 at Smash.21, after Kana had defeated Serena to become the inaugural Smash Diva Champion, Makoto, along with Syuri, Ray and Tomoka Nakagawa, entered the ring to challenge the new champion to a title match. The four challengers had a number one contender's match on October 28 at Smash.22, which was won by Nakagawa. On November 5, Makoto made her debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling in Taiwan, teaming with Bushi and √öltimo Drag√≥n to defeat Cheerleader Melissa, Black Bushi and Dark Dragon in a six-person tag team match. In the buildup to the match Makoto and Melissa brawled at the pre-event press conference. The following day, Makoto was defeated by Melissa in what was billed as the first ever women's wrestling match in Taiwan. On December 25, Makoto made an appearance at Ice Ribbon's RibbonMania 2011 event, taking part in Seina's and Minori Makiba's retirement ceremony after their final match. On December 30 at Smash.24, Makoto wrestled her first hardcore match, when she teamed with Lin Byron in a losing effort against the team of Kana and Smash Diva Champion Tomoka Nakagawa. On February 10, 2012, Smash announced that the promotion would be folding after its March 14 event, after which Makoto would become a free agent. In her final Smash appearance on March 14 at Smash.Final, Makoto teamed with Hisamaru Tajima and Jiro Kuroshio in a six-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Josh O'Brien, Tomoka Nakagawa and Yoshiaki Yago. =Wrestling New Classic and Reina (2012‚Äìpresent)= On April 5, 2012, Tajiri announced the follow-up promotion to Smash, Wrestling New Classic (WNC), which would hold its first event on April 26, and named Makoto as part of the promotion's roster. Prior to WNC's first event, Makoto made her debut for Pro Wrestling Wave on April 8, appearing as former Gatokunyan training partner Moeka Haruhi's surprise opponent and defeating her in just three minutes. Later that same day, Makoto returned to Union Pro to wrestle her first match as Makoto-hime, a mixed tag team match, where she and Choun Shiryu were defeated by Kengo Ohka and Mio Shirai. On April 26 at WNC's first event, Before the Dawn, Makoto teamed with Syuri in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Kana and Mio Shirai, with Kana pinning Makoto for the win. After the match, Kana verbally assaulted Makoto about her Smash/WNC losing streak, which led to Shirai turning on her and standing up for Makoto. During the following months, Shirai took Makoto under her wing and the two began referring to each other as sisters. Makoto also declared war on Kana, though failing to end her Smash/WNC losing streak in both tag team and singles matches against her. The streak finally ended on June 22, when Makoto scored her first direct pinfall since July 2011, by pinning Kana in a tag team match, where she and Mio Shirai faced Kana and Syuri. On June 23, Makoto wrestled her first singles match against Syuri, losing the match via referee stoppage, after legitimately injuring her left wrist. The injury, later diagnosed as an avulsion fracture, forced Makoto to take a two-month break from in-ring action and cancel her first own independent event, titled Mako Pro, scheduled to take place on July 8. During her inactivity from the ring, Makoto entered a storyline, where she set out to find out who had defaced a WNC poster with graffiti and attacked one of the promotion's female trainees. The storyline culminated on August 2, when Hajime Ohara turned on WNC and revealed that he and Nagisa Nozaki, who made her WNC debut and first professional wrestling appearance in thirteen months by attacking Makoto, had been the culprits. Makoto made her in-ring return at a WNC event in Korakuen Hall on August 30, losing to Nozaki in a singles match. Makoto was also defeated in two rematches the following two days, losing all matches via referee stoppage due to a sleeper hold. On September 25, Makoto returned to Pro Wrestling Wave, when she and Moeka Haruhi entered the 2012 Dual Shock Wave tournament. Despite their previous problems with each other, the team, known collectively as \\"1st Impact\\", opened their tournament with a win over Kurigohan (Ayumi Kurihara and Mika Iida). However, the team went on to lose the following matches against Hikaru Shida and Yumi Ohka, and Shuu Shibutani and Syuri, and were, as a result, eliminated from the tournament. On October 3, Makoto made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, wrestling Mika Iida to a ten-minute time limit draw. On November 9, Makoto and Kana, who share the same birthday, co-produced a \\"MakoKana Pro\\" event at Shinjuku Face, celebrating their 23rd and 31st birthday, respectively. Early in the event, the two teamed together in a tag team match, where they defeated the Ice Ribbon team of Hikaru Shida and Hamuko Hoshi. Later, in the semi-main event, Makoto was defeated by veteran wrestler and Oz Academy founder Mayumi Ozaki in a singles match. On November 26, Makoto was defeated by Kana in the first round of the WNC Women's Championship tournament. At the following day's Pro Wrestling Wave event, Makoto and Moeka Haruhi defeated Aya Yuki and Sawako Shimono, Cherry and Shuu Shibutani, Hikaru Shida and Nagisa Nozaki, and Ryo Mizunami and Yuu Yamagata in a five-way tag team match to become the number one contenders to the Wave Tag Team Championship. 1st Impact received their title shot on December 16, but were defeated by the defending champions, Makkurokorosuke (Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto). On December 24, Makoto made an appearance for JWP Joshi Puroresu, taking part in an eleven-woman Santa Cosplay battle royal, which was won by Nana Kawasa. On January 4, 2013, Makoto scored her first win over rival Nagisa Nozaki in a singles grudge match. On January 25, Makoto main evented her first WNC event, when she teamed with Mitoshichi Shinose and Tajiri in a six-person tag team match, where they defeated Akira, Shinya Ishikawa and Syuri, with Makoto pinning the WNC Women's Champion Syuri for the win. Two days later, Makoto was defeated by Syuri in a non-title singles match. Despite the loss, Makoto announced her intention of going for the WNC Women's Championship and was backed in her quest by Tajiri. In March, Makoto revealed that she had developed a new finishing hold, named Arabesque, which she intended to use to become the new WNC Women's Champion. On March 31, Makoto used the move for the first time to defeat Lin Byron during an afternoon show to become the number one contender to the WNC Women's Championship. During another event later that same day, Makoto used the Arabesque to defeat Syuri to become the new WNC Women's Champion. On April 6, Makoto made her debut for Reina Joshi Puroresu, defeating Jenny Rose in a singles match. On April 14, Makoto returned to JWP to nominate the promotion's president Command Bolshoi as the third and final challenger for her first title defense, a four-way match on April 25. Bolshoi ended up accepting the challenge, but also entered JWP Openweight Champion Arisa Nakajima, JWP Tag Team Champion Kayoko Haruyama and Pro-Wrestling: EVE Champion Nikki Storm to the match, turning it into a seven-way match. On April 25 at WNC's one year anniversary event, Makoto lost the WNC Women's Championship to Lin Byron, ending her reign at just 25 days. On April 29, Makoto returned to World Wonder Ring Stardom to take part in the promotion's big Ry≈çgoku Cinderella event at Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan, teaming with Eri Susa, Hikaru Sato and Michael Nakazawa in an eight-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Gota Ihashi, Kota Ibushi, Lin Byron and Mayu Iwatani, after both Makoto and Susa turned on their male tag team partners. Makoto continued working against Command Bolshoi during WNC's events in May, suffering a direct pinfall loss against the JWP president in a six-person tag team match on May 24. Makoto then announced that she was creating herself a masked persona named \\"Lady Face\\", inspired by Leatherface, to continue her rivalry with Bolshoi. Makoto made her in-ring debut as Lady Face on June 27, when she was defeated by Bolshoi 666, a darker version of Command Bolshoi. On July 14, Makoto returned to Ice Ribbon for the first time in two years, wrestling another Ice Ribbon original, Aoi Kizuki, to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Later in the event, after Hikaru Shida had defeated her fellow WNC worker Syuri, Makoto confronted Shida and challenged her to an eight-woman tag team match, where the two would captain two teams of wrestlers between the ages of 24 and 25. On August 3, Makoto entered a three-woman round-robin tournament to determine the new WNC Women's Champion, losing to Serena in her first match. After losing also her second match against Syuri on August 7, Makoto was eliminated from the tournament. On August 20, Makoto announced that she was starting a new stable, named Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen (\\"Private Wrestling School\\"), revealing the recent debutante Kaho Kobayashi as its first inductee. On August 24, Makoto returned to Reina Joshi Puroresu, when she and Ice Ribbon's Miyako Matsumoto entered a tournament for the vacant Reina World Tag Team Championship, losing to Leon and Rydeen Hagane in their first round match. The following day, Makoto returned to Ice Ribbon and teamed with Aoi Kizuki, Arisa Nakajima and Sawako Shimono in an eight-woman tag team match, where they were defeated by Hikaru Shida, Hanako Nakamori, Misaki Ohata and Syuri.

The stable wrestled its first match together on September 18, when they defeated Kito in a three-on-one handicap match. On September 21, Makoto made her debut for the Wrestle-1 promotion, losing to Syuri in a singles match. On September 29, Makoto won a battle royal, which featured all WNC wrestlers, scoring the last pinfall elimination over WNC Champion Tajiri. On October 1, former Stardom wrestler Haruka Kato was announced as the fourth member of Makoto's stable. The storyline rivalry between Makoto's and Takuya Kito's schools concluded on October 31 in a four-on-twelve handicap match, where Makoto, Kato, Matsumoto and Rey Paroma, Makoto's storyline uncle, defeated Kito and his Kuzu Pro school. Post-match, Makoto revealed the newest member of her stable; the returning Mio Shirai, who in turn brought Misaki Ohata with her to also join Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen. On December 22, Makoto made an appearance for Kaientai Dojo, losing to Bambi, who afterwards agreed to become the newest member of Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen. On January 5, 2014, Makoto and Bambi defeated Kaji Tomato and Yuki Sato, Kengo Mashimo and Saburo Inematsu and Daigoro Kashiwa and Ricky Fuji in a four-way match to win Kaientai Dojo's WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship. On January 9, WNC and Reina Joshi Puroresu held a press conference to announce that, as part of their new working relationship, all of WNC's female wrestlers, Makoto included, were now officially affiliated with both promotions. Ahead of Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen's self-produced event on January 26, the stable was joined by wrestler and part-time referee Koharu Hinata, ring announcer Chiho Tomiyama and trainee Haruka Yoshimura. At a WNC event on February 27, Makoto and Bambi made their first successful defense of the WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship against Koharu Hinata and Takuya Kito.

It is the idea that one cannot make judgments about a culture just because they are not a part of one's own. Outsiders should be able to see the cultural from a neutral perspective and not judge the culture before understanding it. Each culture should be viewed with respect and as an equal because no one culture is better than any other. They should be allowed to practice their own beliefs, what a cultures believes to be true, and values, a shared view about what is right. Cultural relativism emphasizes that ethnocentrism, which is the belief that one‚Äôs culture is superior to everyone else‚Äôs, should not be forced upon cultures, and cultures should remain unprejudiced toward each other. Cultural relativism is the moral and ethical way to look at different cultures. Overview Intracultural miscommunication draws on the fact that all humans subconsciously reflect their cultural backgrounds in day to day communication. Culture does not just lie in the way one eats or dresses, but in the manner in which people present themselves as an entity to the outside world. Language is a huge proponent of communication, as well as a large representation of one's cultural background. Cultural miscommunication often stems from different and conflicting styles of speech and messages. A perfectly normal intonation pattern for a native German speaker may seem angry and aggressive to a foreign listener. Connotations of words, as well as meanings of slang phrases, vary greatly across cultural lines, and a lack of tolerance and understanding of this fact often results in misinterpretations. Non-verbal communication greatly varies across cultural lines. One must take the time to study different cultures so as to fully understand messages being transmitted. There are many aspects of non-verbal communication, such as gesture, facial expression and inter-personal space, that affect the way a message is construed. High- and low-power distance: Power distance is the degree of equality, or inequality, between people in a particular society. The lower the power distance of a country, the more dominant individuality and individual rights are. When power distance is low, society does not emphasize people‚Äôs status, power, or wealth. In other words, individualistic cultures have low power distance and collectivist cultures have high power distance. Examples of countries with high power distance include Malaysia, Russia, and Romania while countries with low power distance include Austria, Israel, and Denmark. Individualism‚Äìcollectivism (the Me‚ÄìWe dimension):The individualism-collectivism dimension is thought to be the most important of all value dimensions that distinguish cultures. The individualist culture has a ‚Äúme‚Äù consciousness. Individuals are loosely linked to each other, but largely independent of group identification. Emphasis is placed on the self; they are motivated by their own preferences, needs, and goals, and personal achievement and initiative are stressed. Words such as ‚Äúindependence,‚Äù ‚Äúself,‚Äù ‚Äúprivacy,‚Äù and ‚Äúrights‚Äù are common in individualistic cultural conversations. Examples of individualistic societies would be the United States, or Western Europe countries. The collectivist culture has a ‚Äúwe‚Äù consciousness. Individuals are closely linked to one or more groups. Commitment to these valued groups is a primary goal of collectivists, and they tend to look to the goals and successes of the group rather than to the individuals. Words such as ‚Äúloyalty,‚Äù ‚Äúresponsibility,‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù permeate collectivist cultural conversations. Examples of collectivist societies are many Asian, African, and South American cultures. References *Iowa State University. International Community Resources.

After emigrating from France, he went on to establish Joseph Fahys & Co., which at one time was the largest manufacturer of watch cases and one of the largest manufacturers of silverware in the United States. He was also the founder and first president of the Jewelers' Board of Trade, and the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers' Association. Early years Fahys was born on May 28, 1832 in Belfort, France. He was the son of Joseph and Marianne Moulleseaux Fahys. His father was a contractor; and both his father and brother died when Fahys was young. In company with his mother, he came to New York in March 1848. He apprenticed himself to Ulysses Savoye (or Ulyses S. Savage), of West Hoboken, New Jersey, one of the two first makers of watch cases in the United States. He remained in Savoye's employ for five years, and soon after attaining his majority, began what an independent career. Career Fahys bought out the Savoye business on June 1, 1857. He continued it under his own name and moved the factory to the fourth floor of 75 Nassau Street, New York City before later moving the plant to Carlstadt, New Jersey. In 1861, he formed a connection with Fortenbach Brothers (John, Jacob, and Joseph), which resulted in the building at Carlstadt, one of the first establishments in America which manufactured watch cases on an extensive scale; for five years, business was profitable. In 1867, Fahys located a similar factory in Brooklyn in which he associated with Wheeler, Parsons & Hayes, and the joint enterprise was known as the Brooklyn Watch Case Company. When both factories were well under way, Fahys sold his New York store to Ward & Jennings, two of his employees, and gave his undivided attention to his manufacturing interests. In 1876, he bought the share of the Fortenbach Brothers and moved the Carlstadt plant to Sag Harbor, Long Island. For many years he made a specialty of silver watch cases. He was president of Joseph Fahys & Co., located in the Fahys Building, on 54 Maiden Lane, New York City; the company was established in 1857. Fahys' son-in-law, Henry Francis Cook, who was president of the Montauk Steamboat Company, became a partner of Fays & Co. in 1880. In 1887, in connection with A. N. Darling, Hayden W. Wheeler, Lewis A. Parsons and Henry Hays, he founded the Brooklyn Watch Case Co. for the manufacture of solid gold cases and retained a dominant interest in this for many years though he devoted his time principally to his own factory at Sag Harbor. Fahys was the founder and first president of the Jewelers' Board of Trade, and the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers' Association. He was a member of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, the Union League, and the Downtown Association. He was a trustee of the Homoeopathic Hospital, the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. He was director of the Alvin Manufacturing Co., Brooklyn Watch Case Co., Sea View Elevated Railroad Co., and Victoria Fire Insurance Co. Personal life In 1856, he married a lady who was a native of Sag Harbor. Their son, George Ernest Fahys, who became a partner in the Fahys Co., was born in West Hoboken in 1864. Fahys's daughter, Lena Marianne, married Cook in 1883. Fahys and Cook purchased one thousand acres of land in North Haven, a suburb of Sag Harbor, with two miles of frontage on Peconic Bay. Fahys' Clinton Hill, Brooklyn residences were designed in 1889 and 1890 by Benjamin Wistar Morris, III. Morris also designed Fahys' Long Island country house. Fahys also lived in New York City on Park Avenue. He died at his summer home in Sag Harbor, Long Island.

Design and development Aeromarine developed the AM-1, AM-2, and AM-3 designs in 1923 for an earlier proposal. The BM-1 was a clean-sheet design for the new effort. The BM-1 was a single place biplane with conventional landing gear and a steerable tail skid. The aircraft used a dropable main fuel tank between the main gear to meet crashworthiness requirements and a small header tank of 10 gallons in the upper wing. Control cables were designed not to use pulleys. The wings had optional metal or wood spars with doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage used an all-metal aluminum girder structure with aluminum covering. The horizontal stabilizer used a jack screw for trim adjustment. The engine featured a radiator mounted to the front with a pass-through for the propeller shaft. The BM-1 did not progress beyond design phase.

A leading figure within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Barrett was involved in collusion between loyalists and the British security forces during the Troubles. Early years Barrett was a native of the loyalist Shankill Road area of Belfast and attended the same school as future leader Johnny Adair, Somerdale Secondary School on Somerdale Park (Barrett was, however, a few years above Adair).David Lister and Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and C Company, Mainstream , 2004, p. 27 Barrett joined the UDA some time in the early to mid-1980s and was part of the West Belfast Brigade's B Company which covered the Woodvale area at the top of the Shankill. Barrett quickly gained a reputation within the West Belfast UDA as one of their most zealous gunmen.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 66‚Äì67 According to Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, Barrett became one of RUC Special Branch's paid informers within the UDA in the late 1980s.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp 352‚Äì353 According to a fellow UDA member at the time, interviewed by David Lister and Hugh Jordan and identified by them only as \\"Davy\\", he and Barrett had collaborated on a number of killings at the time, including that of Paddy McAllister in August 1986, Terry McDaid in May 1988, Gerard Slane in September 1988, and Eamon Quinn in February 1990.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 71 The latter killing in particular was the handiwork of Barrett as he had shot the wounded Quinn several times in the head and stomach after he had initially been wounded by \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson of C Company.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 88‚Äì89 One police detective described Barrett as a \\"compulsive gambler\\" and one of the \\"most cold-blooded killers he had ever met\\". Pat Finucane killing It was Barrett's involvement in the murder of Pat Finucane, a Catholic solicitor alleged by loyalists to be in the Provisional IRA, which was to shape his future. According to the aforementioned \\"Davy\\", he had joined with Barrett and Johnny Adair on the night of the killing (12 February 1989), to hijack a car from a taxi driver in Glencairn. He claimed that Barrett then drove the car to the Finucane family home and, whilst Barrett sat outside in the driver's seat, Adair and \\"Davy\\" forced their way inside and fired fourteen shots to kill Finucane.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 67 The UDA claimed the killing soon afterwards, describing it as \\"the execution of Pat Finucane the PIRA officer, not the solicitor\\".Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 69 Brigadier As part of the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries and the series of arrests that took place during them Barrett was briefly given the role of West Belfast Brigadier. Long-serving leader Tommy Lyttle had been arrested and as convention dictated he had to vacate the brigadiership whilst in custody, so command passed to Tommy Irvine. Before long however, Irvine was also arrested as part of the Stevens inquiries and so Barrett was promoted to the top job. However, Barrett proved to be an ineffectual leader and before long he was pushed aside in favour of Billy Kennedy, Tommy Lyttle's brother-in-law and the man chosen by the former brigadier as his successor.Wood, Ian S., Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA\\", Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 155 Eventually Jim Spence would emerge as brigadier with Adair as military commander as power passed into the hands of the Lower Shankill's C Company.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 99 Despite being sidelined, Barrett remained close to the new leadership and was frequently recorded as being in the company of Adair around 1990 and 1991 by police surveillance files.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 102 On 17 January 1991 Barrett shot and wounded Thomas McCreery, a former hitman for the UDA's North Belfast Brigade who had gone freelance as a drug dealer and whose activities were threatening the West Belfast Brigade's own expanding drugs empire.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 148 Stevens inquiries Under interrogation, in 1991 Barrett had confessed to Johnston Brown, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer who spent much of his career investigating the activities of the UDA in West Belfast, that he had fired shots into Finucane as he lay on the ground.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 318 Other police officers serving at the time recalled Barrett as a braggart, who regularly boasted to them that he had killed ten people.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, pp. 320‚Äì321 The tape upon which the confession was made then disappeared. Lister and Jordan suggest that this, rather than the late 1980s, was the point at which Barrett was taken on as an RUC Special Branch informer.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 77 The evidence provided by Barrett as an informer saw him resettled in England as part of a witness protection scheme. His involvement in providing information on the activities of his fellow UDA members had become common knowledge with graffiti appearing on the Shankill denouncing him as a \\"big nose, big mouth tout\\".The murky world of informers He was taken from Belfast by the Stevens team after fellow informer William Stobie was killed by the UDA in 2001.Finucane police 'posed as drug dealers' Finucane trial Barrett was interviewed for an episode of the BBC's documentary series Panorama, which was examining the Finucane murder. Barrett was shown telling the programme that he had been involved in the killing and the documentary reignited the furore over the issue allegations of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 352 In the documentary, Barrett claimed that the murder had initially been suggested by Jim Spence of C Company and that Spence had introduced Barrett to a contact in Special Branch who had informed Barrett that Finucane controlled the Provisional IRA's finances.Lister and Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 78 Barrett also claimed that an RUC roadblock had been set up specifically to help the killers that night, adding that \\"Finucane would have been alive today if the peelers [police] hadn't interfered\\". Barrett was arrested for the murder of Pat Finucane in England in late May 2003 after he had boasted to two undercover policemen, posing as international drug dealers as part of a sting operation, that he had \\"fucking massacred\\" Finucane. Johnny Adair, who had been expelled from the UDA in 2003, had hoped to use the Finucane trial to push for his own return as he believed that his arch rival Jim Spence would be revealed in the course of the trial as an agent of the British government, something Adair had maintained in his criticism of Spence. According to author Ian S. Wood, Spence called on the help of UDA brigadier Mo Courtney in an attempt to secure Barrett's co-operation in avoiding as long a case as possible. Wood claimed that Spence had promised Courtney a substantial sum of money to \\"lean on\\" Barrett, with both men being held on remand in Maghaberry at the time.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 320 In secret recordings played at his trial he described his feelings after killing Finucane, \\"I lost no sleep over it. All is fair in love and war. I have to be honest, I whacked a few people in the past\\".\\"Loyalist gunman who killed Pat Finicane goes free after three years under early release pact\\". The Guardian. Owen Bowcott. 24 May 2006. Retrieved 3 November 2011 Barrett pleaded guilty to the murder as well as eleven other charges and as a result only briefly appeared on the stand with Spence's name not mentioned in his short testimony.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 305 He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of twenty-two years. =Reaction and release= The Finucane trial outcome was met with much scepticism, notably by the Finucane family themselves who demanded, and continue to call for, a proper inquiry into the allegations of collusion surrounding the solicitor's death.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-15260827 Johnny Adair was equally dismissive of Barrett's guilty plea and disputed the version of events that had been provided by \\"Davy\\". According to Adair \\"Barrett is a bastard informer and I hate him, but he did not pull the trigger\\" and he added that he had not been involved either before adding that he had no intention of informing on the real guilty party.Trust IRA, Mad Dog Adair tells loyalists Despite the recommendation that Barrett serve a minimum 22 years the Sentence Review Commission endorsed his case for early release and he was freed from Maghaberry, to which he had been transferred, in May 2006.Finucane killer freed from jail Barrett left Northern Ireland immediately after his release.Finucane Killer Flees North After Release; Barrett is freed after less than 3yrs of life sentence References External links * Ken Barrett YouTube Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Ulster Defence Association members Category:Loyalists imprisoned during the Northern Ireland conflict Category:People from Belfast Category:People from Northern Ireland convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Northern Ireland Category:Prisoners from Northern Ireland sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Northern Ireland Category:Royal Ulster Constabulary informants ","title":"Ken Barrett (loyalist)"},{"id":"33598777","text":"Too Late to Cry may refer to: * Too Late to Cry (Widowmaker album), 1977 * Too Late to Cry (Alison Krauss album), 1987 ","title":"Too Late to Cry"},{"id":"33598780","text":"The Burro Mesa Archeological District encompasses a quarry in Big Bend National Park used by Native Americans as a source of chert for chipped-stone tools.

Will has been active in many genres: poetry, fiction, cultural history, philosophy, translation, travel memoir. Life and career =Early years= The American poet/novelist/critic/translator Frederic Will was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1928. His parents, Samuel and Constance, moved the family to the Midwest in 1930; Will's father was for the next 25 years a professor of French at the University of Illinois and at Indiana University. His mother was a bilingual (English/French) housewife. The house in which he was brought up was lined with bookshelves of French literary classics‚ÄîMontaigne and Rabelais featured, in leather bindings cut for them on the Left Bank. Will was raised on the campus of the University of Illinois, where‚Äîexcept during two years of asthma recovery in Arizona‚Äîhe remained until going to Phillips Andover for his senior year of high school. His subsequent education was at Harvard (1946), Laval University in Quebec, and at Indiana University (B.A. in Classics, 1949), and Yale University (PhD Comparative Literature, 1954). Laval, with its pre-modern Thomist atmosphere, was the deepest of these forays into learning from others. =Personal life= Will is married, has six children, and lives both in Mount Vernon, Iowa and in Delta State, Nigeria. He has traveled widely, both in Asia and Africa, and has only two more locations on his must- visit list: Russia and Zaire. Writing and traveling seem to him activities that call on one another, as though the appetite of the world to be named accompanied the writing instrument of the seeing traveler. =Career= Will has taught comparative literature, classics, and translation workshops at various universities in the United States and abroad: Dartmouth (1951‚Äì54), Penn State (1955‚Äì60), University of Texas (1960‚Äì65), University of Iowa (1965‚Äì70, 1983‚Äì85), University of Wisconsin (1967), University of Massachusetts Amherst (1970‚Äì83), University of Colorado (1978), Deep Springs College (2004‚Äì06), Instituto de Estudios Criticos (2007). He was co-director of the University of Iowa International Writing Program (1983-1985). He was overseer and president of Mellen University (1990‚Äì1999). Abroad he has taught at the Universities of Tuebingen, Tunis, Ivory Coast, Chad, Mizoram (India), Chang'sha China (Hunan Normal). He currently teaches for the Humanities University (humanitiesuniversity.org or humanitiesinstitute.org), where he is vice president for research.

Arion marked a turning point in Anglo-American classical studies, replacing positivist 'contribution studies' by more imaginative and daring efforts to open the classical tradition into its blazing richness. Micromegas, like Robert Bly's The Sixties, was a single- handed effort to enrich American poetry with the bloodstreams of at first contemporary Latin-American poetry, and then, in subsequent issues, of a wide variety of national issues‚ÄîFrench, German, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic. =Archival material= Will's literary and editorial papers (1962‚Äì) are in the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas.

He was posted to Bithynia with a Roman fleet as part of the Third Mithridatic War. He was defeated by King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Rescued by his fellow consul he reduced the Pontic coast and captured the city of Heraclea after a two-year siege. Returning to Rome in 70 BC, Cotta was acclaimed for his victory. However, around 67 BC he was convicted of the misappropriation of war booty and expelled from the Senate, a signal mark of disgrace. Family Cotta, hailing from a distinguished plebeian family, was the son of Lucius Aurelius Cotta who was consul in 119 BC, while his older brother Gaius Aurelius Cotta preceded him as consul in 75 BC. His younger brother Lucius Aurelius Cotta was consul in 65 BC. Aurelia Cotta, the mother of Julius Caesar, was his half-sister. Career Climbing the cursus honorum, the sequential mixture of military and political administrative positions held by aspiring politicians in the early Roman Republic,Mennen, pg. 129Birley (2000b), pg. 115 it is assumed that he held the post of praetor in 77.Broughton, pg. 85 Elected consul in 74 BC alongside Lucius Licinius Lucullus, he was soon concerned with the escalating situation in the east brought about by the acquisition of the new province of Bithynia and the subsequent renewal of conflict with King Mithridates VI of Pontus who had invaded Bithynia. Having received Bithynia as his proconsular commandAnthon & Smith, pg. 226 he received command of a fleet to protect his province and was dispatched to the east towards the end of his period as consul.Holmes, pg. 180 The original plan was that Cotta should tie down Mithridates' fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta was therefore ordered to station his fleet at Chalcedon, while Lucullus marched through Phrygia with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked Cotta, and forced him to flee behind the walls of Chalcedon. Sixty-four Roman ships had been captured or burnt, and Cotta had lost three thousand men.Holmes, pg. 180; Appian. Mithridates. 71; Plutarch. Lucullus. 8 Cotta was forced to remain in Chalcedon until Lucullus could to come to his rescue.Broughton, pg. 99 Mithridates left Cotta under siege at Chalcedon while he himself marched his main army westwards. Lucullus caught Mithridates besieging Cyzicus and established a counter-siege successfully trapping Mithridates' army before the city. Famine and disease did the work for Lucullus at the Siege of Cyzicus. Mithridates left his army to its fate and fled by ship to Nicomedia.Appian, Mithridatica, 74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 9-12 Having made his way to Nicomedia, Cotta watched in frustration as Mithridates, learning that his fleet had been destroyed by Lucullus, escaped the city and sailed down the Bosporus to the town of Heraclea Pontica.Holmes, pg. 183 Joined by Lucullus at Nicomedia in 73, Cotta was assigned the task of securing Lucullus' rear by capturing Heraclea Pontica, which Mithridates had reinforced with 4,000 troops.Holmes, pg. 184 After reducing the Pontic coast, Cotta began besieging Heraclea Pontica, which took him two years to capture, sacking the city in 71.Broughton, pgs. 110, 116 & 122 During this time he dismissed one of his quaestors, P. Oppius, charging him with bribery and conspiracy.Broughton, pg. 110 Returning to Rome in 70 BC, Cotta was at first widely acclaimed for his victory at Heraclea Pontica.Broughton, pg. 127 However, around 67 BC he was accused of appropriation of war booty by Gaius Papirius Carbo.

He began as a scholar of Old and Middle English literature at the University of Virginia and Stony Brook University. He changed fields to journalism education in 1984, joining the Poynter Institute of Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Florida, a journalism think-tank. In 1994, he became an independent writing coach.  Life and career  A native of Raleigh, North Carolina, Fry learned to write from Phyllis Abbott Peacock at Needham B. Broughton High School. He earned a degree in English literature (1959) from Duke University. Fry served as a communications and gunnery officer on U.S.S. Massey (DD-778), an Atlantic Fleet destroyer (1959‚Äì1962). He was a graduate student at University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in English (1966) specializing in early medieval literature. Fry began his academic career as an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Virginia (1966‚Äì1969), then moved to Stony Brook University, becoming a Professor of English and Comparative Literature (1969‚Äì1984). Fry chaired the Program in Comparative Literature, and the Arts and Sciences Senate, and served as Provost for Humanities and Fine Arts (1975‚Äì1977). Fry became an Associate at the Poynter Institute in 1984, and later headed the Writing and Ethics faculties, and edited the Institute‚Äôs annual publication Best Newspaper Writing (1985‚Äì1990, 1993). With his colleague Roy Peter Clark Fry systemized the techniques of coaching writers, invented at the Boston Globe by Donald Murray. Fry and Clark published their methods in Coaching Writers: Editors and Reporters Working Together (St. Martin's, 1991). They expanded their coverage to multimedia in a second edition: Coaching Writers: Editors and Reporters Working Together across Media Platforms (Bedford-St. Martin's, 2003).  Works  = Academic works = Fry began his academic writing with his 1966 dissertation, Aesthetic Applications of Oral-Formulaic Theory: Judith 199-216a, which established terminology and techniques for analyzing the artistry of formulaic poetry in England before 1066. He later published articles from this dissertation that influenced a generation of scholars studying Anglo-Saxon poetics. Fry wrote three books on Beowulf: The Beowulf Poet: A Collection of Critical Essays (Prentice-Hall, 1968); Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburh: A Bibliography (Virginia, 1969), praised for the \\"immense amount of intelligent labor\\" from Fry; and Finnsburg Fragment and Episode (Methuen, 1974). He also published two reference books on Old Norse: Norse Sagas Translated into English (AMS, 1980) and Medieval Scandinavia, An Encyclopedia (Garland, 1993, with Phil Pulsiano). He has been praised for his \\"investigation of the type-scene as an episodic unit in narrative\\", explaining how narratives such as Beowulf are constructed from simpler units involving repeated motifs. He also discovered a new manuscript of the Old English poem Durham.  On writing  Fry teaches writing skills and teaches editors how to help their writers. In 2008-2012, he wrote a blog on ‚ÄúWriting Your Way, in Your Own Voice,‚Äù published by Writer‚Äôs Digest as a book in 2012 as Writing Your Way, Creating Your own Writing Process that Works for You. Fry teaches writers to create their own writing process based on magnifying their strengths, and changing or compensating for their weaknesses. He developed techniques for creating a writing voice, defined as ‚Äúdevices used consistently to create the illusion of a person speaking through the text.‚Äù Since 1995, he has taught in the Greenbrier Symposium for Professional Food Writers, coaching on structure, description, and courage. He has been called \\"one of the world‚Äôs most respected and well-traveled writing coaches\\".  Selected bibliography  = Books = * Pulsiano, Philip; Donald K.

Joseph Fahys & Co is most famous for their production of the Dust Proof Case and the Magnetically Shielded Case during the 1880s. The company‚Äôs handmade gold and silver watches are sought after and highly collectible today. In 2013, Joseph Fahys & Co began developing a luxury American-made smartwatch with a patent pending kinetically charged battery. History The Fahys Watch Case Co Factory in Sag Harbor 1878 The founder of the company, Joseph Fahys, was born on May 28, 1832 in Belfort, France. In 1848, Fahys emigrated from France to the United States with his mother. He was apprenticed to Ulysses Savoye, of West Hoboken, New Jersey, who was one of the two first watch case makers in the United States. He remained Savoye‚Äôs employee for five years until beginning an independent career at the age of 21. In 1857, Fahys had earned enough to be able to buy Savoye‚Äôs business and he renamed it: Joseph Fahys & Co. He initially moved the business to 75 Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan, but later relocated the factory back to Carlstadt, New Jersey By 1867, the company had expanded and a second factory was opened in Brooklyn. Shortly after, Fahys relocated the original plant to Sag Harbor, Long Island. It has been suggested that Fahys was able to move to this location only as a result of the socio-economic changes brought about by the Great Fire of Sag Harbor in 1877. The business was officially incorporated in 1881, when Fahys went into partnership with his son-in-law Henry Francis Cook. The watch plant in Sag Harbor was titled ‚ÄòThe Fahys Watch Case Co.‚Äô, while the firm in New York remained under the name ‚ÄòJoseph Fahys & Co.‚Äô The corporation absorbed the Brooklyn Watch Case Company and the Alvin Manufacturing Company of New Jersey. During this time, the company not only manufactured watchcases but was also the biggest producer of silverware in the United States. Fahys used his influence and success to found the Jewellers Board of Trade in 1884, and was the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers Association. During the latter part of the 19th Century, the company was the largest manufacturer of gold and silver watch cases in the United States. Fahys‚Äô watch factory in Sag Harbor created an immediate demand for manual as well as skilled labor. A large proportion of its laborers were retired seamen and immigrants. Historian Helen Gerard notes: ‚ÄúRecruiters from the factory went directly to Ellis Island‚Ä¶and offered the immigrants jobs. Whole families would transfer to the steamer going directly to Sag Harbor without ever setting foot in New York‚Äù. The factory was said to have sported a social hall with billiards room and card tables, and a library. Fahys employed a high number of Hungarian, Polish and Italian workers, many of whom were expert engravers. The company earned a reputation for providing excellent working conditions and benefits for its employees At the height of its success, it was reported that the Sag Harbor factory required $6,000 (around $350,000 in 2015) worth of gold to be melted down each day to produce its wares. During the Great Depression, Joseph Fahys & Co. suffered just as many other businesses who produced ‚Äòluxury items‚Äô did. Under growing financial strain Fahys sold the Sag Harbor plant to Joseph Bulova, an Austrian watchmaker who continued to produce watchcases in the factory until 1975. Present Day In 2013, under new leadership Joseph Fahys & Co. began development on their luxury smartwatch, the In-Touch. In-Touch will feature the finest materials and be assembled to an exacting standard in New York. What makes the In-Touch unique is its patent pending technology that uses a kinetic generator to charge the battery as the user moves their wrists. This will enable the user to use the watch for up to 72 hours without needing to be charged via power supply. The In-Touch will be released early 2017 and will cost around $1,600. Mechanical Watches Since 1857 all Fahys watchcases have been fitted with high quality mechanical movements. The cases were made of gold, silver and oresilver (nickel) and Fahys' goods were acknowledged by the entire trade to be unequaled in their strength and workmanship. During the mid-1880s, Joseph Fahys & Co marketed a range of Dust Proof Cases which were resistant to dirt and water. One of their adverts of the time proclaimed ‚ÄúWater won‚Äôt hurt it!‚Äù This was a bold statement at the time. In the late 1880s, there was a growing concern about the risk of watchcases becoming magnetized. To answer such concerns, Fahys utilised the Giles Anti-Magnetic Shield in order to release a range of magnetically shielded cases. Joseph Fahys & Co manufactured a variety of shapes of watches. Fahys gave some of these styles unique names, for example: the Raleigh, the Boston, the Olympia and the Cambridge. The company also offered a range of engraved styles ranging from Locomotive designs to Ships of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The company also produced bracelet watches. At the height of production during the First World War, Joseph Fahys & Co. also produced a series of silver trench watch cases that housed Marvin A. Cattin and Imperial Branded movements. Smart Watches Rendering of In-Touch by Joseph Fahys & Co. in stainless case with black vulcanized rubber strap and stainless deployment buckle clasp In development since 2014, Joseph Fahys & Co will release the In-Touch luxury smartwatch which will be the first to feature an integrated kinetic generator. The In- Touch will be available in Stainless Steel, 14K Rose Gold, Platinum and Black PVD Stainless Steel cases with a vulcanized rubber strap and deployment buckle. It will feature the most advanced technological specs including: Corning Gorilla Glass SR+, Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, 1 GB RAM with a fully circular AMOLED display with 10,000:1 high contrast ratio. The In-Touch will be waterproof to 50 meters / 164 feet. Yehuda Fulda, Chairman of the Board said \\"The In-Touch is a technological tour de force on your wrist, reflecting years of research and design, it's - a luxury watch you will be proud to wear in any setting\\". The In-Touch will be assembled in New York. Factories & Offices After purchasing the business from his mentor and renaming it Joseph Fahys & Co, Fahys moved the watch plant from Hoboken, New Jersey to New York. Shortly after, however, he relocated the factory again to Carlstadt, New Jersey. A second factory was opened in 1867 in Brooklyn. Early in 1880, Fahys met with the Sag Harbor Business Aid Committee, and the New York Times later reported the selection of Sag Harbor as the future site of a new watchcase factory, stating, ‚ÄúPlans furnished by John A. Wood called for two main buildings 200 feet in length, three stories high, and connected by a 100-foot structure. Five separate buildings, each one story high, would be constructed to house a blacksmith shop, boiler, engine rooms and rooms for annealing and smelting silver and gold. They would be constructed of brick and granite trim, have stone floor and roofs of tin, making them absolutely fireproof. Steam would be used for heating and gas for lighting, which would be manufactured on the premises. A vault 10 x 13 feet, made of 1-1/2-foot granite blocks, would be installed in the main building, and a high fence would surround the entire place.‚Äù. The factory was said to have sported a social hall with billiards room and card tables, and a library. The relocation of the factory led to a housing boom in Sag Harbor, with approximately 80 small factory workers‚Äô houses being built to accommodate the new workers. The factory building itself has been labelled as ‚ÄúGradgrind\\" architecture, a name inspired by an inflexible, dictatorial Dickens character. Wilfrid Sheed in ‚ÄòSag Harbor Is: A Literary Celebration‚Äô said that the building was ‚Äúone of those epic anomalies that help to define a landscape by clashing with it Approximately 1,000 workers were employed between the Sag Harbor and Brooklyn factories at the height of the company‚Äôs success. In 1925, much of the Sag Harbor factory was destroyed by fire. By 1931, amidst the financial pressures of Great Depression, the factory was closed. In 1937, Joseph Bulova, an Austrian watchmaker, took a ten-year lease on the building, and later bought it. Bulova operated the factory until 1975, when the plant was closed due to increased overseas competition and a changing marketplace. In 2014, the abandoned factory was redeveloped into a luxury complex consisting of condominiums, penthouses and townhouses named ‚ÄòThe Watchcase‚Äô Whilst the Fahys factories have been in various locations, the offices have always been New York based. The offices were first based at 75 Nassau Street until 1861, when they moved to 9 Maiden Lane, then to 38 Maiden Lane and then to 41 Maiden Lane. In 1896 the Fahys building at 54 Maiden Lane, running through to Liberty Street, was built and the offices and showrooms were relocated there In 2015 Joseph Fahys & Co moved its headquarters to the iconic Empire State Building in New York City.

He composed music for the film Garam Coat in 1955. He should not be confused with the very popular composer of the same name, Amarnath, who was very active in Lahore and Mumbai film industry in 1940s and died around 1947. He was the first and closest disciple of Amir Khan, who founded the Indore gharana of Indian classical music. While Amir Khan had specially propagated the vilambit or the slow style of singing, Amarnath further enriched the gharana with the mystic poetry he wrote as bandish for khayal singing, under the pen-name of Miturang. Amarnath was born in 1924 in Jhang in Punjab, now in Pakistan. He received his initial training in music from B.N. Datta of Lahore, from 1942 to 1947, and moved to Delhi after the partition of India. It was his first guru, Prof. Datta, who suggested that he go to Khan for further learning. As Amarnath was already singing the Ustad's style, and as public opinion was that the disciple sounded so much like his guru, Amir Khan was convinced about his sincerity, and accepted him as a disciple. Besides devoutly following Amir Khan's style, teaching and demonstrating the style, Amarnath also served at All India Radio for eight years as composer, recruited specially by Ravi Shankar during the latter's tenure at AIR. Amarnath later served as Director of Triveni Kala Sangam, and then as Guru at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra in Delhi. He also provided music for the 1955 film Garam Coat starring Balraj Sahni and Nirupa Roy, with songs by Lata Mangeshkar. Amarnath also directed the music for a documentary on Mirza Ghalib. This included the first and only ghazal recorded in the voice of Amir Khan; the documentary was made by M. S. Sathyu. Amarnath died on 9 March 1996. Legacy The book, Conversations with Pandit Amarnath conducted by Bindu Chawla based on conversations with him, was published by Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Delhi, in the year 2004. A book on his m√©moires of Amir Khan, titled \\"Indore ke Masiha/Prophets of Indore, m√©moires of my guru, Ustad Amir Khan Saheb\\", was published in 2008 by the Pandit Amarnath Memorial Foundation.

It is the last film directed by Alain Corneau, and was released after his death from cancer. Plot Isabelle (Sagnier) is a young, ambitious and talented executive working in the Paris office of an unnamed multi-national corporation. Her immediate boss is Christine (Scott Thomas), equally ambitious, who presents Isabelle's work as her own to win a promotion to the firm's New York office. Tired of being upstaged, and with the aid of a colleague, Daniel (Marquet), Isabelle blindsides Christine with a secret project that the New York office enthusiastically endorses. Christine's New York promotion is subsequently withdrawn. Enraged by what she considers an act of disloyalty, Christine begins to psychologically torment Isabelle. Christine's lover, Philippe (Mille), works with the firm and is suspected of embezzling funds. Using this information against him, she blackmails Philippe into standing up Isabelle, with whom he is having an affair, leaving her inconsolable. Isabelle is then humiliated at a staff party in which security camera footage of her meltdown is presented to her colleagues. Relaxing at home after hosting another soiree, Christine is stabbed to death by Isabelle, who plants evidence at the home implicating herself as the killer. With police pursuing the obvious motive that she was taking revenge for her various humiliations at the hands of Christine, Isabelle is arrested and, despite giving all the signs of being in the grips of a nervous breakdown, confesses to, and then is charged with, her murder. Awaiting sentencing in prison, Isabelle withdraws her confession, claiming it was made under duress and while heavily medicated. She begins to pick apart the circumstantial evidence implicating her guilt; scratches on her arm thought to be knife wounds were from a gardening accident, witnesses testify to seeing her at a cinema at the time of the murder and a kitchen knife thought to be the murder weapon is actually located in Isabelle's shed. The last piece of evidence is a torn strip of a scarf found at the murder scene, an item originally given to Isabelle by Christine as a gift. When Isabelle is able to produce an identical scarf, completely intact, at her home, she is cleared of the charges and released from prison. Acting on a tip provided by Isabelle herself, police learn of Philippe's embezzlement, and a search of his property locates the remaining section of the scarf in his vehicle, planted there by Isabelle as part of an elaborate effort to frame him. He is arrested and charged. Isabelle, now free of both her nemeses, returns triumphantly to her company.

The consensus states \\"Director Corneau's swan song, Love Crime is smart and typically well-directed, but too thin and formulaic to overcome its melodramatic trappings.\\".

S. political history of the 1980s, the Gang of Four refers to Bernard W. Aronson, Bruce P. Cameron, Robert S. Leiken, and Penn Kemble, four advocates of U.S. Congressional funding for the Nicaraguan Contras, who were engaged in an armed campaign in opposition to the Sandinista government, during the Reagan Presidency. The four were prominent policy analysts and activists in the U. S. Democratic Party. Background: The Nicaraguan Contras and the United States During the 1980s in Nicaragua, the Contras were engaged in an armed campaign against the Sandinista government. In the beginning, the Contras consisted largely of former members of the National Guard of Somoza, the dictator who had been overthrown in the 1979 Revolution. The Contras were joined also by former revolutionaries who had turned against the Sandinista policies; a third source of personnel were farmers angered by the Sandinista land reform and American Indians.In the 1980s, the leftist Sandinista government established \\"Committees of Sandinista Defense\\" (Comit√©s de Defensa Sandinista). (\\"The Black Book of the Sandinistas\\" , 21 November 2006, Jamie Glazov, FrontPage Magazine) In response, several Miskito groups eventually formed guerrillas in the 1980s, which carried on armed struggle against the central government. On 25 February 1982, Steadman Fagoth, one of the guerrilla leaders, took refuge in Honduras along with 3,000 Miskitos. (Asleson, Vern, Nicaragua: Those Passed By, Galde Press , 2004) The Sandinistas began to denounce the activities of Contras in the Rio Coco zone. The Miskitos occupied the village of San Carlos during the \\"Red December\\" (20‚Äì21 December 1982) during which several Sandinista soldiers were killed. In retaliation, the state massacred 30 Miskitos in the following days, prompting many of them to escape to Honduras to live in a difficult state of exile. The state of emergency in the Rio Coco zone was proclaimed in 1983, and lasted until 1988. (Gilles Bataillon, ¬´ Cambios culturales y sociopol√≠ticos en las comunidades Mayangnas y Miskitos del r√≠o Bocay y del alto r√≠o Coco, Nicaragua (1979‚Äì2000) ¬ª, Journal de la Soci√©t√© des Am√©ricanistes, 2001, tome 87, On line ) In 1983 the Misurasata movement, led by Brooklyn Rivera, split, with the breakaway Misura group of Stedman Fagoth allying itself more closely with the FDN, one of the first Contra commanded by Enrique Berm√∫dez. A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance. The Contras had financial and military support from the Central Intelligence Agency of the U.S. However, a CIA-supported manual advocating killing Sandinista politicians and poisoning wells in Nicaragua, as well as mining harbors, provoked a backlash. The House Appropriations Bill of 1982 contained the Boland Amendment, which outlawed U.S. assistance to the Contras for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan government, while allowing assistance for other purposes. Having been passed unanimously, the appropriations bill was signed by President Ronald Reagan on December 21, 1982.Congressional Limitations and Requirements for Military Deployments and Funding The Boland amendment enjoyed wide support among Democrats but had been opposed by the Reagan Administration. Soon after they had blocked Contra aid, Congressional Democrats were embarrassed and politically vulnerable because of the Sandinistas. Very soon after the vote, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced that he would visit the Soviet Union. The Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, a liberal Democrat, was troubled by reports of harassment of the Catholic Church. Some Sandinistas had earlier endorsed the Communist crack- down on Poland's labor movement, Solidarity. Advocacy of Congressional funding of Contras The Gang of Four were four advocates of U.S. Congressional funding for the Contras, who were notable for being prominent Democrats. =Leiken's criticism of Nicaraguan Sandinistas in 1984= In October 1984, The New Republic published \\"Nicaragua's Untold Stories\\", which criticized the Sandinistas for economic mismanagement, corruption, and violations of human rights. The author was Robert S. Leiken, a Democratic policy analyst who had previously been an opponent of the Vietnam War. > The turning point came in the fall of 1984, when, after an intense 10 day > trip to Nicaragua, Leiken returned 'appalled and angry' over conditions > there. He wrote an article criticizing the Sandinistas in terms that were, > for a liberal Democrat, unmistakably powerful and all the more striking > because they appeared in the traditionally liberal The New Republic > ....(Christopher Madison, \\"Profiles in Influence: A Scholar's About Face On > the Sandinistas,\\" The National Journal, June 14, 1986) Leiken's article caused controversy among Democrats, according to Time Magazine: > The idea that a well respected liberal analyst would launch such a strong > attack on the Sandinistas caused considerable stir in Washington. Leiken's > apparent conversion was seen by the entrenched left as a betrayal and by > Reaganites as a vindication of their long held views. Most important, many > Democrats who had relied on Leiken's analyses began to reconsider their > Sandinista sympathies. Senator Edward Kennedy had the article read into the > Congressional Record. Suddenly, Leiken became as controversial as Nicaragua > itself.(Jill Smolowe, \\"Conversion of a Timely Kind; A liberal analyst fans > controversy with his pro Contra views,\\" Time Magazine, April 21, 1986) =Other advocacy= Aronson helped to draft President Reagan's speech on Contra aid, which influenced moderate Democrats. Excerpts were introduced into the Congressional Record. Their goal was not to overthrow the democratically elected Sandinista government, but to pressure the Sandinistas to negotiate a peace treaty with the Contras. They differed from the Reagan Administration on some questions. For example, they supported efforts to transfer control of Contra funding from the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense to the Department of State's USAID; they also supported negotiations opposed by Reagan Administration \\"hard-liners\\" who wished to overthrow the Sandinistas. All four members were nationally prominent Democratic Party policy analysts who had criticized the conduct of the Vietnam War. Their advocacy of Congressional funding for the Contras was unpopular among liberals and progressives in the Democratic Party. The label \\"Gang of Four\\", alluding to the Chinese Gang of Four who had allegedly sought a revival of the Maoist Cultural Revolution, was ironic.

It can be used as a shade area house plant or interior ornamental plant or in a greenhouse.  Growth  During spring to summer, the plant blooms with very showy orange-red flowers. The bright yellow corolla, with some red stripes or spots, is about twice the length of the calyx, with a narrow tube and flaring lobes. The corolla is short-lived, lasting only a day or two, but the colored calyx is very long-lasting and decorative. Leaves are large, dark-green with brown touch and very ornamental. The thick and succulent stems are usually grown upright. The flowers are formed densely together as a bunch of foliage.http://toptropicals.com/catalog/uid/Chrysothemis_pulchella.htm The plant has tubers at the base of the stem, and sometimes also in the leaf axils. The tubers get dormant if temperature gets too low. Below certain temperature, the leaves and stem vanish and the dormant tubers starts to regrow the plant later when the right weather appears. Copper leaf prefers filtered light and requires regular watering to ensure constant moisture in the soil. Chrysothemis is a genus of about six species. The name originates from Greek mythology. Chrysothemis was a daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon.http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s1309275.htm Among its genus, Chrysothemis pulchella (beautiful) is the most widespread species, the most variable, and the one found most often in cultivation.http://toptropicals.com/catalog/uid/Chrysothemis_pulchella.htm  References Category:Gesneriaceae Category:Plants described in 1849 ","title":"Chrysothemis pulchella"},{"id":"33599418","text":"Wave of Sorrow is an album by Mikhail Alperin and Arkady Shilkloper recorded in 1989 and released on the ECM label.

Though present in Western music from biblical times in the form of the antiphon, as a component specific to new musical techniques the concept of spatial music (Raummusik, usually translated as \\"space music\\") was introduced as early as 1928 in Germany.Beyer, Robert (1928). \\"Das Problem der ‚Äòkommenden Musik'\\" [The Problem of Upcoming Music]. Die Musik 20, no. 12: 861‚Äì66. The term spatialisation is connected especially with electroacoustic music to denote the projection and localization of sound sources in physical or virtual space or sound's spatial movement in space. Context The term \\"spatial music\\" indicates music in which the location and movement of sound sources is a primary compositional parameter and a central feature for the listener. It may involve a single, mobile sound source, or multiple, simultaneous, stationary or mobile sound events in different locations. There are at least three distinct categories when plural events are treated spatially:Maconie, Robin (2005). Other Planets: The Music of Karlheinz Stockhausen (Lanham, Maryland, Toronto, Oxford: The Scarecrow Press, Inc.): 296. . #essentially independent events separated in space, like simultaneous concerts, each with a strong signaling character #one or several such signaling events, separated from more \\"passive\\" reverberating background complexes #separated but coordinated performing groups.

It has governed the Commission scolaire de Montr√©al (CSDM) since the commission's founding in 1998. Origins M√âMO was founded in August 1987 to contest that year's elections for the Montreal Catholic School Commission (MCSC). The party was secular and progressive in its orientation, and its primary goal was replacing Quebec's denominational school boards with boards based on language.\\"New group to challenge for school-board control,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 August 1987, p. 4. M√âMO's first president was Marie-France Cloutier, who argued that the MCSC's promotion of Roman Catholic education and values had created an exclusionary climate.\\"MCSC chief, slate seeking re-election,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 November 1987, p. 3.

In opposition, on the Montreal Catholic School Commission ;1987‚Äì90 M√âMO served as the official opposition to Michel Pallascio's conservative board executive from 1987 to 1990. In April 1990, one M√âMO commissioner criticized Pallascio's board for passing a resolution mandating that school principals be required to uphold \\"Christian values.\\" In the same period, the party reiterated its belief that only linguistic school boards could bring about improved cultural relations.Janet Bagnall, \\"Catholic school commission adopts ethnic action plan,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 April 1990, p. 5. ;1990‚Äì94 In the 1990 school board elections, new M√âMO leader Kenneth George called for the MCSC to be restructured as a francophone board and for its English-speaking students to be transferred to a new Montreal-wide anglophone board.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"MCSC should be French-only: George School; board candidate sees no sense in present system,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 October 1990, p. 3.

During this period, some critics argued that M√âMO's support for a francophone school board caused it to ignore the concerns of anglophone students. A representative of the MCSC's English sector said \\"there was definitely a pattern\\" of the party working against real or perceived gains by his department, though he added that this was based on M√âMO's strategic goals and not by malice.Lynn Moore, \\"Catholic schools' MEMO party worries anglo parents; Commissioners' voting record reveals an anti-English pattern, critics charge,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 November 1992, p. 1. M√âMO said that its policies were not intended to be anti-English.\\"MEMO is losing its mission\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 26 November 1992, p. 2. The Montreal Catholic School Commission unexpectedly endorsed M√âMO's proposal for linguistic boards in June 1994, when two RSC members broke ranks to support an opposition motion on the issue.

The RSC and COURS later formed a coalition, and M√âMO remained in opposition for the next four years.\\"Conservatives form coalition to keep power at Catholic board,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 December 1994, A3. M√âMO supported the Quebec sovereignty option in Quebec's 1995 referendum on independence, arguing that sovereignty would help to eliminate \\"privileged treatment\\" for anglophones in both the MCSC and the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. The two boards in question responded by accusing M√âMO of pitting anglophone students against their francophone counterparts. All elected M√âMO representatives indicated their personal support for sovereignty, which was narrowly defeated by Quebec voters.Andy Riga, \\"The Referendum: School-board opposition party backing Yes: Sovereignty would help wipe out English students' \`privilege,' MEMO says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 October 1995, A14. In early 1998, M√âMO unsuccessfully sought to have two English schools in west-end Montreal re-designated for the proposed francophone board. M√âMO argued that the transfer would help correct a $74 million imbalance in the value of buildings exchanged between the Catholic and Protestant boards in anticipation of their replacement by linguistic boards. The MCSC executive responded that M√âMO was trying to start a \\"linguistic war\\" for electoral purposes and that the re-designation would have been illegal in any event.Alexander Norris, \\"English schools stay English: French board rejects MeMo bid to grab west-end buildings,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 May 1998, A3. Governing party on the Commission scolaire de Montr√©al M√âMO won fourteen seats in the 1998 Commission scolaire de Montreal election, as against only seven for the RSC. M√âMO leader Diane De Courcy, who was chosen to chair the new commission, described the result as \\"a big change toward modernity ‚Äî finally.\\"Ingrid Peritz, \\"MEMO takes control of Montreal's French board,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 June 1998, A5. Following the election, De Courcy reiterated her party's request for $74 million worth of school buildings to be transferred from anglophone schools to the CSM. She was quoted as saying, \\"It doesn't bother me if it happens over two or three years. I have the interests of English students just as much at heart as the interests of French students.\\"Elena Cherney, \\"MEMO claims $74 million in English schools: The ruling party at Montreal's new French school board says too many schools - and the ones in best shape - were ceded to the English Montreal School Board. It demands redress,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 June 1998, A3; Yvonne Zacharias, \\"French board eyes English schools,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 February 1999, A3. Subsequently, M√âMO also became involved in bitter quarrel with Montreal's four other school boards over control of the Montreal Island School Council.Yvonne Zacharias, \\"Council at impasse: Control of executive committee still up in the air,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 September 1998, A3. In 1999, five of M√âMO's elected commissioners defected from the party to sit as independents in alliance with the RSC. This gave the opposition a majority on the commission, and, on September 1, the board voted to dismiss all members of the executive committee, including De Courcy. An independent investigator later determined that this dismissal had put the board in an illegal situation, and the provincial government imposed partial trusteeship over the CSM on September 29. De Courcy welcomed the government's intervention and argued that her opponents were motivated by a personal vendetta.Yvonne Zacharias, Nicolas Van Praet, and Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Trustee to run French board,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 September 1999, A1. She was subsequently re-confirmed in office, but for the next three years was forced to run the board in a minority situation. In October 2000, opposition members succeeded in removing M√âMO representatives from most positions on the CSM's committees.Allison Lampert, \\"Power struggle at the CSM: Chairman staying despite vote that she quit,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 October 2000, A3. In the buildup to the 2003 Commission scolaire de Montreal election, outgoing M√âMO councillor Robert Cadotte accused the PQ of effecting a takeover of the party. Although he himself was a PQ member, Cadotte said that he regarded the mixing of provincial and school board politics as dangerous.Allison Lampert, \\"PQ plans takeover of school board,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 August 2003, A6.

This finally gave the party a secure majority, which it held for the next four years.

These special reactors are crucial in maintaining a working nanofoundry; which is essentially a foundry that manufactures products on a nanotechnological scale. Summary =General information= Researchers in the Netherlands have succeeded in building nanoreactors that can perform one-pot multistep reactions - the next step towards artificial cell-like devices in addition for applications involving the screening and diagnosis of a disease or illness.Another nanotechnology example of mimicking nature: nanoreactors for one-pot multistep reactions at NanoWerk A biochemical nanoreactor is created simply by unwrapping a biological virus through scientific methods, eliminating its harmful contents, and re-assembling its protein coat around a single molecule of enzyme.Viral nanoreactor captures single molecules at RSC.org The kinetic isotope effect is trapped in a single molecule within a membrane-based nanoreactor.Isotope effect seen on single molecule at RSC.org This is a phenomenon that has been found by researchers in the United Kingdom during experiments done in September 2010. The kinetic isotope effect, where the rate of a reaction is influenced by the presence of an isotopic atom in solution, is an important principle for elucidating reaction mechanisms. This recent finding could open up new methods to study chemical reactions. They may even aid in the process of creating new (and even more powerful) nanoreactors. Using nanocrystals, a scalable and inexpensive process can ultimately create nanoreactors.Hollow Nanocrystals and Nanoreactors at Berkeley Lab Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley have the ability to take advantage of the large difference in select components to create these nanocrystals and nanoreactors. Nanocrystals are easier to use and less expensive than methods that employ sacrificial templates in the creation process of hollow particles. Catalyst particles are separated into shells in order to prevent particle aggregation. Selective entry into the catalysis chamber reduces the likelihood of desired products undergoing secondary reactions. Nanoreactors can also be built by controlling the positioning of two different enzymes in the central water reservoir or the plastic membrane of synthetic nanoscopic bubbles.Nanoreactors For Reaction Cascades at Science Daily Once the third enzyme is added into the surrounding solution, it becomes possible for three different enzymatic reactions to occur at once without interfering with each other (resulting in a \\"one-pot\\" reaction). The potential for nanoreactors can be demonstrated by binding the enzyme horseradish peroxidase into the membrane itself; trapping the enzyme glucose oxidase. The surrounding solution would end up containing the enzyme lipase B with the glucose molecules containing four acetyl groups as the substrate. The resulting glucose would cross the membrane, become oxidized, and the horseradish peroxidase would convert the sample substrate ABTS (2,2‚Äô-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) into its radical cation. =Abilities= Nanoreactors can also be used to emulisfy water, create hydrofuels (which essentially blends 15% water into the refined diesel product), play a helpful role in the chemical industry by allowing multiple streams of raw materials to exists in a single nanoreactor, manufacture personal care products (i.e., lotions, pharmaceutical creams, shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, deodorants), and improve the food and beverage industries (by processing sauces, pur√©es, cooking bases for soup, emulsifying non-alcoholic beverages, and salad dressings).CTI Nano Reactors Applications at CTI Nanotech Personal care goods can be enhanced by companies feeding multiple phases of material, using a mixing device with water, and creating instant emulsions. These emulsions would come with smaller particles, are expected to have a longer shelf life and an give off an enhanced appearance when sold at retailers. The needs of the food and beverage industry can result in lower processing costs, more space, better efficiency, and lower equipment costs. This may bring down the cost of food and beverages for consumers; even alcoholic beverages that are subject to hidden sin taxes. Hydrofuel can be used to move heavy duty transports, trains, earth-moving equipment (including bulldozers), in addition to providing fuel to most boats and ships. Reduced pollution and increased fuel efficiency may come out of nanoreactor-produced hydrofuel. The increased usage of renewable energy may also help to improve the world's environment thanks to nanoreactors.

Most of concretions in the eye form in the palpebral conjunctiva, which is a clear membrane to surround the inside of the eyelid; fewer can be located in the cornea and retina. Symptoms Conjunctival concretions are generally asymptomatic. Common symptoms include eye discomfort, eye irritation, and foreign body sensation. Sometimes, the larger, harder or multiple concretions make the rubbing off of the superficial layers of the conjunctiva or eyelids to cause conjunctival abrasion, especially prominent when upon blinking. In severe cases, dysfunction or inflammation of the Meibomian (Meibomianitis, an inflammation of the tarsal glands) glands may occur. Cause Chronic conjunctivitis (e.g. trachoma) and aging factor are two causes of conjunctival concretion, which will make the conjunctiva cellular degeneration to produce an epithelial inclusion cyst, filled with epithelial cells and keratin debris. After calcification, the conjunctival cyst hardens and forms a conjunctival concretion. Congenital conjunctival concretion condition is also more common. =Clinical Statistics= Conjunctival concretions can be single, also multiple, less confluent. There is no difference between the site of the occurrence on the upper and lower eyelid, nor right or left eye. The vast majority of concretions are in the conjunctival surface rather than deep. There is no difference in age for predilection or incidence of concretions, due to the causes of conjunctivitis, aging, and even congenital factor. Treatment Conjunctival concretions can be seen easily by everting the eyelid. The projecting concretions can be removed if they are causing concerning symptoms. Removal can be performed by an eye doctor. Sometimes just a needle or a scalpel is used to remove the concretion under local light anesthesia of the conjunctiva in adults.

He built a number of palaces in European style within the city of Seoul. He also built the first Russian Legation building, also in the city of Seoul. This building is a historical site because shortly after the Japanese invasion of Korea, in 1895, when the Korean Queen Min was assassinated by the Japanese, King Gojong and his son were given refuge in the Russian Legation for a year. Biography Ancestry Afanasii‚Äôs father: Ivan Vassilievich Seredin-Sabatin. Was of noble birth, landed gentry, of the province of Poltava, Ukraine, where the family owned an estate, with serfs. They lived in the town of Lubny, in the same province, where they also owned properties. Afanasii‚Äôs mother: (name unknown) Ivan Vassilisvich‚Äôs first wife (Afanasii‚Äôs mother) was a Ukrainian commoner, descended from Zaporozhian Cossacks (on the Dnieper River, Ukraine). Summarized Biography Afanasii Ivanovich Seredin-Sabatin, was born in Lubny, Poltava, Ukraine, in 1860. While he was still very young his father remarried. His stepmother was cruel towards him, thus, at the age of 14 he went to live with his uncle in Petrograd. Afanasii attended the Petrograd Academy of Arts for a year. He also attended an architectural university (it is unknown which one). However, just before graduating he apparently had a falling out with a professor and left the university without graduating. With no certificate of graduation he was unable to find work as an architect. Later he entered a Sea Cadet Corps school. Upon graduation he became steersman-pilot of a Russian vessel in the Far East. It was there that he met his future wife. Lydia Christianovna Shalich, was of Polish-German origin, born in Galicia, Russian Empire. She had a very good contralto voice, often singing in concerts. She was also a good swimmer and hiker. Lydia educated their four children. Lydia died in 1936, at the age of 69, in Shanghai, China. Afanasii spent sometime at sea in the Far East until arriving in Korea in 1883 where he was hired by Paul Georg von M√∂llendorff for geodesic and construction works. Once in Korea Afanasii learned that the Korean King was seeking a European architect to build a number of buildings on palace grounds. Apparently King was interested in western culture, and it did not seem to matter to King that Afanasii did not have a degree in architecture. So at the age of 24 Afanasii left the sea and lived and worked in Korea, where he built a number of buildings of note, a number of which are still standing. He also left historical marks in other ways‚Äînamely as an eyewitness to the assassination of Queen Min by the Japanese. Later, and while still in the Far East, Afanasii mastered the English language and worked for a while as reporter for an English newspaper. Afanasii also built several summer homes at Peitaho, China, and other countries. Soon after the Russo-Japanese war (1904‚Äì05) he suffered some kind of a nervous disorder and left his family consisting of his wife, four daughters and one son. Afanasii went at first to Vladivostok, Siberia, then to European Russia where he died in 1921. The place of his death is uncertain. It was either at Rostov-on-the-Don, or Volgograd (former Tsaritsin) on the Volga. Afanasii loved hunting with his 10 caliber double-barreled shotgun. He was an excellent swimmer (having saved several people from drowning), an accomplished tennis player, and an indefatigable hiker. He was irresponsible, and despite his many talents, the family very often found themselves in dire financial straits.

Eyewitness to the assassination of Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong) September 25, 1895 (Its Russian old calendar = 8 Oct 1895) On 8 October 1895, Empress Myeongseong (referred to as \\"Queen Min\\"Characteristics of Queen of Corea The New York Times Nov 10, 1895) was assassinated by Japanese agents. It was the Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Goro that had orchestrated the plot against her. In 2001, Russian reports on the assassin were found in the archives of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and Karl Ivanovich Weber's report to Lobanov-Rostovsky, the Foreign Minister of Russia. Weber was the charg√© d'affaires at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time. According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin (an employee of the Korean king, a group of Japanese agents and members of the Hullyeondae army entered the royal palace,See Russian eyewitness account of surrounding circumstances at by Gari Ledyard, Sejong Professor of Korean History Emeritus at Columbia University killed Empress Myeongseong, and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace. She was forty-three years old at the time of her assassination. Reacting to the murder, father of King's Daewongun returned to the royal palace on the same day. On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and his crown prince moved from the Gyeongbokgung palace to the Russian legation in Seoul, from which they governed for about one year, an event known as Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation.

Isis Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated next to Belmarsh Prison and Thameside Prison. History In May 2009, the Ministry of Justice awarded Interserve a ¬£110 million contract to design and construct a new prison called Isis on underused land within the perimeter wall of Belmarsh Prison. The new prison was built to Category B security standards. In August 2009, the construction site of the new prison was evacuated after contractors discovered a suspected World War II bomb. Isis Prison is located on the site of the former Royal Arsenal, and the suspected bomb was found to be an empty shell casing. Interserve handed over the completed Isis Prison in April 2010, with the prison becoming operational soon after. In January 2012, an inspection report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised faulty technology which was being used at the prison. The report also found that the combination of new and transferred staff was causing problems in forming good staff-prisoner relations at the jail. However the report praised the prison's resettlement services, low drug use and support of prisoners at risk of self-harm. A month later, inmates at Isis claimed that there was a significant gang culture developing in the prison. Isis prison governor, Grahame Hawkins, admitted that gangs were a problem in the prison. The prison today As a Young Offenders Institution and C-cat prison Isis holds male offenders aged from 18 (there is no maximum age). Accommodation comprises a mixture of single and double cells in two house blocks. The prison also has an entry building and a central activities centre (which houses a learning academy, segregation unit and PE academy). However the prison does not have in-patient healthcare facilities. Education and vocational training at the prison is delivered in partnership with Kensington and Chelsea College. Courses include mechanics (motorbike repair), construction, waste management, bicycle repair, barbering, catering, reprographics, broadcasting and media studies, ESOL and job related studies. There is a visitor's centre at Isis Prison which is run by the Spurgeons charity. The visits complex consists of a main room, a supervised children's play area, a refreshment counter and vending machines.

Archery is the national and most popular sport in Bhutan. Competitions are held regularly in most villages. Other traditional Bhutanese sports include khuru, soksom, pundo, and digor. International sports enjoy considerable popularity in modern Bhutan. Besides archery, many people in Bhutan play basketball. Other sports include Association Football and futsal, an indoor variation of football. Cricket has gained popularity in Bhutan, particularly since the introduction of television channels from India. Traditional sports An archery competition in Thimphu. Archery cheerleading in Bhutan. Archers dancing to celebrate a bullseye. Traditional Bhutanese sports include archery first and foremost. Traditional archery has been historically prominent in Bhutanese religion, ritual, and recreation, and enjoys modern popularity and practice in tsechus (festivals) and matches. It differs from modern international archery in rules and metrics; players shoot at comparatively small targets at great distances. Bhutan also participates in modern international archery competitions, and maintains an Olympic archery team. Khuru is an indigenous dart game, and like traditional archery, requires players to strike relatively small targets at long distances. It is played especially during festivals, along with soksom, akin to the javelin throw; and digor and pundo, akin to the shot put. =Archery= Archery is a national and most popular sport in Bhutan and is organized nationally within the Bhutan Archery Federation.Prince Claus Fund, Bhutan Archery Federation profile Traditional Bhutanese archery differs from Olympic standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. The distance to the target is about . The relatively small targets are cut from wood and brightly painted, usually measuring about tall and wide. Bullseyes are called karay. Traditionally, Bhutanese bows are made of bamboo, and arrows from bamboo or reeds, fletched with feather vanes. Arrows may be painted and tipped with metal arrowheads. The quiver may be wooden, with an animal hide covering and a woven strap. Bhutanese archery teams number at 13 players; teams take turns shooting two arrows at a time first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. The first to score 25 points wins, however because the scoring system is complicated, winning can take a very long time. For example, a second hit by an opponent can invalidate the other player's score. In addition, the interplay of wider socializing and festivities, with archery as the nominal focus, give Bhutanese archery competitions an excruciatingly slow pace. In the past, the most traditional matches could last for as long as a month, though modern matches tend to span a number of days. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organised between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. The most notable archery competition in Bhutan is the Yangphel tournament. Other major archery competitions are held during Losar, the Bhutanese and Tibetan New Year. Increasingly, Bhutanese archery has modernized even in traditional matches. Compound bows, corporate sponsorships, copious cash and material winnings, injuries, and occasional fatalities have become established features of archery. The popularity of archery has also raised questions of Bhutan's susceptibility to doping, including by alcohol, in the sport. It has also drawn attention to the danger in the sport, especially to spectators, residents, and passers by near archery ranges. Since 2010, Bhutan has held the Lyonchen Jigmi Y Thinley Archery Tournament, encouraging the use of traditional bows and the development of gewog teams. =Khuru= Khuru (darts) is a popular outdoor team sport often played during festivals and archery tournaments. When playing khuru, heavy wooden darts pointed with a nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target to away. =Soksom= Soksom, akin to the javelin throw, is a sport in which players throw a javelin a distance of . =Digor= Bhutanese men playing digor. Digor is a game resembling shot put, horseshoes, and p√©tanque. It is played with a pair of spherical flat stones that are hurled at two targets (pegs) fixed in the ground about apart. It can be played one-on-one or in teams of up to seven players. Digor is played all over Bhutan, though most often by men in rural areas. =Pundo= Pundo is a traditional Bhutanese game most resembling shot put. It is played by throwing a stone weighing over a kilo as far as possible. The throwing movement is from the shoulder, with the stone held flat in the hand. It is usually played by laymen. International sports Bhutan participates in modern international sports in three main areas. Archery, the national sport, is played internationally as well as domestically using modern equipment, and the kingdom maintains an Olympic archery team. Further, Bhutanese basketball, football and futsal teams compete at national, international, and Olympic levels. Cricket also enjoys a considerable following in Bhutan. The Bhutan Olympic Committee was formed in 1983 and recognized by the IOC the same year. For each Summer Olympic Games since 1984, Bhutan has fielded male and female archers to compete in the kingdom's national sport. They have never competed in the Winter Olympic Games nor the other events of the Summer Olympic Games; they also have never won an Olympic Medal. Bhutan sent only one athlete to the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics but lost in the quarterfinals of the athletics event. =Basketball= The Bhutan Basketball Federation joined the international basketball federation FIBA in 1983. Its national team has played many qualification games for the FIBA Asia Championship but still waits for its breakthrough. =Football= The sport of football in Bhutan is run by the Bhutan Football Federation. The association administers the Bhutan national football team as well as the A-Division. In 2002, Bhutan's national football team played Montserrat, in what was billed as The Other Final; the match took place on the same day Brazil and Germany in the World Cup Final, but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world's 2 lowest ranked teams. The match was held in Thimphu's Changlimithang national stadium, and Bhutan won 4-0. =Futsal= The Bhutan national futsal team represents Bhutan in international futsal competitions and is controlled by the Bhutan Football Federation. =Cricket= The Bhutan national cricket team represents the kingdom in international cricket matches and is one of the most successful affiliate nations in the region. Bhutan became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2001. They made their international debut at the 2004 ACC Trophy, where they made the quarter finals. They again competed at the ACC Trophy in 2006 but were eliminated in the first round after a series of heavy defeats. Their only win came against newcomers Myanmar. Following the 2006 ACC Trophy, the tournament was split into two divisions, Elite and Challenge. Bhutan took part in the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, where they were runners up. This result qualified them for the next ACC Trophy Elite as well as Division eight of the World Cricket League. Venues Changlimithang Stadium, during a parade Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu is the main venue for major sporting events in Bhutan, including archery and football. With a capacity of 25,000, the stadium has also hosted theatrical performances and celebrations as part of national holidays and major events such as the royal wedding in 2011. As archery is especially popular, every village has a field for the sport.

Her parents were divorced when Lutes and her sisters Alice and Florence were still children, and her mother brought the children to live with their grandfather; their last names were changed to Cronise. \\"Nettie\\" attended Heidelberg College and the State Normal School at Bloomington, Indiana before studying law at the office of Warren P.

Cradles to Crayons Philiadelphia throws annual campaign like their \\"Ready for School\\" initiative. This campaign urges individuals and businesses in Philadelphia to help provide resources to local homeless children. The money donated towards this campaign is used to distribute new \\"Kidpacks\\", which are filled with school supplies to help homeless kids feel prepared and excited to learn. Cradles to Crayons goal is to make it as easy as possible to donate. Cradles to Crayons goal is \\"making it convenient to turn compassion into action.\\". = Boston = Among communities across Massachusetts, C2C is looked to as a leader in the non-profit sector. In 2011, Cradles to Crayons was acknowledged as an innovative grassroots leader and was recognized with the ‚ÄúPartnership of the Year‚Äù award from the Boston Business Journal for their work with Staples, and received the prestigious Neighborhood Builder Award from Bank of America. In that same year, C2C was honored to be chosen by Massachusetts Governor, Deval Patrick, to host his inaugural Project 351 event, a day of public service with 8th Grade representatives from each of Massachusetts‚Äô 351 cities and towns. This year C2C was honored to serve again as a site for Project 351. Deval Patrick led a day of community service in the warehouse with hundreds of high schools students from Massachusetts. = Chicago = In October 2016, Cradles to Crayons opened its Chicago location in a 20,000-square-foot warehouse facility titled the Giving Factory. Cradle To Crayons goal for the Chicago office is similar to the goal of the organizations other locations in Boston, Massachusetts, and Philadelphia. The organization's main objective is to provide underprivileged children with life‚Äôs basic needs such as clothes and school supplies. Several volunteers within the Chicago community welcomed Cradles to Crayons by contributing to the organization's goal of receiving 16,000 donations, so children above the age of 12 can get off the streets and into a better living situation. Many basic living essentials are donated and are put through a screening process. If the items donated do not meet the organization‚Äôs standards, they are recycled or given to other charities that may be able to use them.  The Giving Factory  The Giving Factory uses corporate, school, and neighborhood volunteers who sort the donated items based on clothing size, reading level, and interests. Based on the success Cradles to Crayons has had at its Boston and Philadelphia locations, the organization wanted to ensure that all children in Chicago had access to these resources regardless of their families' income. In one year Cradles to Crayons' Chicago office served 47,211 children by providing them with life‚Äôs basic essentials. Cradles to Crayons arrived in Chicago with a plan of creating events for volunteers to work at. In its first year in Chicago, Cradles to Crayons had 6,000 volunteers that were committed to working with the organization in hopes of achieving the organization‚Äôs goal of helping all children obtain life‚Äôs essential materials. In an effort to attract more volunteers to work with the Chicago office, Cradles to Crayons has hosted ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù events of its Chicago Giving Factory. Adults that are 21 and over are given an exclusive tour of the Chicago factory and get a first- hand observation at the progress Cradles to Crayons has been making in the Chicago area. As of December 2018, the Chicago location appointed a new director, Shoshana Buchholz-Miller, and the organization hopes to motivate more Chicagoans to volunteer at the Giving Factory. Services and programs Cradles to Crayons' programs operate year-round to support disadvantaged children across the state of Massachusetts, providing the essentials each child needs to overcome their unique situations and excel both inside and outside of the classroom. C2C collects new and gently used children‚Äôs items through grass roots community drives. Donated items are then sorted, inspected and packaged into personalized ‚ÄúC2C KidPacks‚Äù by volunteers. KidPacks are filled with clothing, shoes, books, arts and crafts, and often birthday presents. KidPacks are brought directly to the families free of charge, through partnerships with hundreds of qualified social service agencies across Massachusetts such as Catholic Charities, The Home for Little Wanderers and Horizons for Homeless Children. Cradles to Crayons' signature program, Everyday Essentials, operates without interruption; programs are focused with seasonal initiatives. From July through September, Ready for School provides children with the materials they need to feel ready to learn from head to toe, including a special emphasis on providing thousands of new backpacks with necessary school supplies. In 2017, Ready for School served 70,000 children. Gear Up for Winter supplies kids with the cold weather gear that they need to stay warm. During the traditional spring cleaning months, Spring Greening encourages families to clean out their closets and donate their gently used items to C2C. Gear Up for Baby focuses on gathering infant and child safety equipment throughout May and June.  Events  = 2018 = In April 2018, in partnership with Comcast and from assistance from hundreds of volunteers, Cradles for Crayons packaged more than 7,500 hygiene kits for children across Chicago. That same month, CTC also partnered with Metropolitan Family Services in their collaboration with Walgreens, Huggies, and former Chicago Cubs catcher David Ross to distribute 250,000, a $10,000 donation, and 1.5 million diapers to the younger aid receivers. The following month saw CTC partner with television networks NBC 5 and Telemundo along with several Xfinity stores in an effort to gather more donations. Later in August, CTC teamed up with Jordans Furniture by collecting new and like-new clothing and shoes at all store locations and at the Taunton Distribution Center. The total amount of donations were enough to assist more than 3,000 children in need. October saw the nonprofit hold an interactive 21+ event in its factory that showcased daily operations and practices. In December, CTC held an event for volunteers to come into their warehouse on the Northwest side to help meet the increased demand for the holiday season. = 2019 = In June 2019, Cradles to Crayons teamed up with Jordans Furniture again by collecting new and like- new clothing and shoes at all store locations and at the Taunton Distribution Center. Jordans Furniture donation has helped Cradles to Crayons by collecting enough clothing to provide for 3,000 children. Later in August, Cradles to Crayons held an event in Chicago‚Äôs Daley plaza to fill 50,000 backpacks with school supplies for homeless or low-income children. In October, twenty locations across Chicago, including the Oak Park Public Library, held that year‚Äôs annual Gear Up For Winter initiative where gently-used coats and other winter clothing items were collected to later be donated. Impact Over the years, Cradles to Crayons has distributed more than 290,000 packages of essential items to disadvantaged Massachusetts children, including 127,000 backpacks filled with brand new school supplies. In 2011 Cradles to Crayons engaged more than 24,000 volunteers in the \\"Giving Factory\\" warehouse to fill 55,000 packages for disadvantaged Massachusetts children. Cradles to Crayons‚Äô overarching goal is to eliminate the effects of child poverty throughout the Commonwealth, their short-term goal is to continue connecting communities of need with communities of plenty. Media Cradles to Crayons was reviewed by Charity Navigator, an organization which evaluates the financial health, accountability and transparency of America's largest charities. Cradles to Crayons was featured in the December 2011 issue of The Oprah Magazine.

It also expanded to at least 26 other countries. Riot grrrl is a subcultural movement that combines feminism, punk music and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the riot grrrl movement, and has recently been seen in current fourth-wave feminist punk music. It has also been described as a genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men have been doing all along.Marion Leonard. \\"Riot grrrl.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 Jul. 2014. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, classism, anarchism and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater- Kinney, as well as queercore groups such as Team Dresch and the Third Sex. In addition to a unique music scene and genre, riot grrrl became a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action and activism. The movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to influence the vibrant zine and Internet-based nature of fourth-wave feminism, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end intersectional forms of prejudice and oppression, especially physical and emotional violence against all genders. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music as well as art created by transgender people, gays and lesbians, and other oppressed communities. Origins During the late 1970s throughout the mid-1980s there were a number of groundbreaking female punk and mainstream rock musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, the Slits, Au Pairs, the Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, the Runaways/Joan Jett, the B-52's, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush Tetras, Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, X-Ray Spex, Scrawl, and Anti- Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.R. Sabin, Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk, (Routledge, 1999), During the mid-1980s in Vancouver, the influential Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed. They were followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands. Sassy magazine then premiered in 1987 and dealt with tough subjects that many conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. In 1989, an article titled, \\"Women, sex and rock and roll,\\" was published by Puncture, a punk zine edited by Katherine Spielmann, and became the first manifesto of the movement.E. McDonnell, Rock She Wrote (Cooper Square Press, 1999), Two years later in 1991, Your Dream Girl, a radio show hosted by Lois Maffeo, debuted on Olympia, Washington radio station KAOS. During the early 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a sophisticated do it yourself infrastructure. Women involved in independent and underground music scenes took advantage of their platform to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires by creating punk-rock fanzines and punk bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets had already been used by the punk movement as a way to spread the names of underground bands, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the exclusion of women in punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk- rock shows often saw themselves as the musician's girlfriend or groupies, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their fanzines, music and art. In 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, such as the Christian Coalition of America's Right to Life campaign against legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the International Pop Underground Convention and later L7's Rock for Choice. Uses and meanings of the term \\"riot grrrl\\" developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual Mount Pleasant race riots in spring 1991. Bratmobile member Jen Smith (later of Rastro! and the Quails), used the phrase \\"girl riot\\" in a letter to Allison Wolfe. Soon afterwards, Wolfe and Molly Neuman collaborated with Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail to create a new zine and called it Riot Grrrl, combining the \\"riot\\" with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail's fanzine Jigsaw \\"Revolution Grrrl Style Now\\". Riot grrrls took a growling double or triple r, placing it in the word girl, as a way to take back the derogatory use of the term. =Bikini Kill= Kathleen Hanna had been studying at The Evergreen State College in Olympia. She participated in a small collective art gallery called Reko Muse, which would frequently host bands like the Go Team and Some Velvet Sidewalk to play in between art exhibitions (partially just to keep the gallery running). Hanna started a band, Amy Carter (named after the daughter of the US President Jimmy Carter), with fellow gallery-founders Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland. After touring with some other projects like Viva Knievel, she hooked up with Go Team drummer and zinester Tobi Vail, who had been writing of her own experiences: > I feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important > to me. And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys > mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a > time of mindless career-goal bands. They started working together on another fanzine called Bikini Kill, which, after recruiting friends Kathi Wilcox and Billy \\"Boredom\\" Karren, would eventually become a band. =Bratmobile= Bratmobile in 1994. Allison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the University of Oregon. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as Beat Happening and the Melvins, Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and Public Enemy. They began working on zines called Girl Germs, and later riot grrrl with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith. > It was a really hippie town, and we were getting really politicized, but > also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make > our own fanzine!' Wolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like Fugazi and Nirvana. In 1990, Calvin Johnson called them up and asked them to play a show on Valentine's Day with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991. =International Pop Underground Convention= From August 20 ‚Äì 25, 1991, K Records held an indie music festival called the International Pop Underground Convention. A promotional poster reads: > As the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of > industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the > World to convene in celebration of our grand independence. Hangman hipsters, > new mod rockers, sidestreet walkers, scooter-mounted dream girls, punks, > teds, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry > grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern > librarians and Scottish ski instructors who live by night, all are setting > aside August 20‚Äì25, 1991 as the time. An all-female bill on the first night, called \\"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now!\\" signalled a major step in the movement. The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Nikki McClure, Lois Maffeo, Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, 7 Year Bitch, and two side projects of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with Sharon Cheslow of Chalk Circle (DC's first all-women punk band) and Dug E. Bird of Beefeater, the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses. It was here that so many zinester people who'd only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women. The convention featured other bands such as Unwound, L7, the Fastbacks, the Spinanes, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Girl Trouble, the Pastels, Kicking Giant, Rose Melberg, Seaweed, Kreviss, I Scream Truck, Scrawl, Nation of Ulysses, Jad Fair, Thee Headcoats, and Steve Fisk, and spoken-word artist Juliana Luecking. This convention demonstrated a new relationship between audience and performers, dismantling the power dynamic of the past, for instance voicing anger at people harassing the female performers. = Decline and later developments = By the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered. Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the Spice Girls and their \\"girl power\\" message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like Lilith Fair. Later waves of riot grrrl chapters opened in Latin America, North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia through to the 2010s. Of the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emily's Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, the Gossip were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums. Many of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist post-punk \\"protest pop\\" group Le Tigre and later the Julie Ruin, Kathi Wilcox joined the Casual Dots with Christina Billotte of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 co- founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and Partyline. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning Lookout! Records and managing the Donnas, Ted Leo, Some Girls, and the Locust. Kaia Wilson of Team Dresch and multimedia artist Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct Mr. Lady Records which released albums by the Butchies, the Need, Kiki and Herb, and Tracy + the Plastics. Feminism and riot grrrl culture Riot grrrl culture is often associated with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question \\"What is Riot grrrl?\\" with: > \\"[Riot Grrrl is ...] Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to > US. We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy > punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need to talk to each other. > Communication and inclusion are key. We will never know if we don't break > the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves > slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, > ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, > knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created > for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without > being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.\\" Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement. The riot grrrl movement encouraged women to develop their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where \\"women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the mosh pit, but had to 'fight ten times harder' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported.\\" In contrast, riot grrrl bands would often actively invite members of the audience to talk about their personal experiences with sensitive issues such as sexual abuse, pass out lyric sheets to everyone in the audience, and often demand that the mosh boys move to the back or side to allow space in front for the girls in the audience. The bands weren't always enthusiastically received at shows by male audience members. Punk Planet editor Daniel Sinker wrote in We Owe You Nothing: > The vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl ‚Äì and Bikini > Kill in particular ‚Äì was shocking. The punk zine editors' use of 'bitches', > 'cunts', 'man-haters', and 'dykes' was proof-positive that sexism was still > strong in the punk scene. Kathi Wilcox said in a fanzine interview: Kathleen Hanna would later write: \\"It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled \\"take it off\\" during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song.\\" Many men were supporters of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and Slim Moon have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and Kill Rock Stars respectively. Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot said, \\"I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock.\\" Dave Grohl and Kurt Cobain dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of the Slits and even convinced the Raincoats to reform. He once said, \\"The future of rock belongs to women.\\" Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear. Molly Neuman once summarized: \\"We're not anti-boy, we're pro-girl.\\"The Punk Years ‚Äì Typical Girls. YouTube. Riot grrrl concerts provided a safe haven for women, and often addressed issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality and female empowerment. For example, in Bikini Kill's \\"Don't Need You\\", they sing: \\"don‚Äôt need you to say we‚Äôre cute/don‚Äôt need you to say we‚Äôre alright/don‚Äôt need your protection/don‚Äôt need your kiss goodnight\\", rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics. Influenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' in favor of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: \\"Learn how to NOT play your instrument\\" and \\"hey, you don't have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves\\", arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for \\"not being able to play their instruments\\", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism \\"play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what\\" attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements. Media misconceptions As media attention increasingly focused on grunge and alternative rock in the early nineties, the term \\"Riot Grrrl\\" was often used as a catchall for female- fronted bands and applied to less political alternative rock acts. While many of these female-centric or all-women rock bands such as Hole, 7 Year Bitch, Babes in Toyland, the Breeders, the Gits, Lunachicks, Liz Phair, Veruca Salt, and L7 shared similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies with the riot grrrl movement, not all of these bands or musicians self-identified with the riot grrrl label. To their chagrin, in 1992 riot grrrls found themselves in the media spotlight gracing magazines from Seventeen to Newsweek. Fallout from the media coverage led to resignations from the movement, including Jessica Hopper, a teenaged music critic who was at the center of the Newsweek article. To ease tension, Kathleen Hanna called a \\"press block\\" for that year. In an essay from January 1994 that had been included in the CD version of Bikini Kill's first two records, Tobi Vail responded to media misrepresentation of Bikini Kill and riot grrrl in general : > One huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over > again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe > these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is > the definitive 'riot girl band' ... We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or > authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have > each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying > degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those > who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never > used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect > and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, > and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably > considered 'riot girl.' Musician Sharon Cheslow stated in EMP's Riot Grrrl Retrospective documentary: > There were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media > couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls > who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach. Musician Corin Tucker stated: > I think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just > ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do > serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would > take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of > context. We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers > and young women. I think those are really important concepts that the media > never addressed. YouTube. Other female-fronted punk bands, such as Spitboy, were less comfortable with the childhood-centered issues of much of the riot grrrl aesthetic, but nonetheless dealt explicitly with feminist and related issues as well. Lesbian-centric QueercoreChapman, Kathleen / du Plessis, Michael, \\"Queercore: the distinct identities of subculture\\", College Literature, February 1997 bands, such as Fifth Column, Tribe 8, Adickdid, the Third Sex, Excuse 17, and Team Dresch, wrote songs dealing with matters specific to women and their position in society, exploring issues such as both sexual and gender identity. A documentary film put together by a San Diego psychiatrist, Dr. Lisa Rose Apramian, Not Bad for a Girl, explored some of these issues in interviews with many of the musicians in the riot grrrl scene at the time. Other bands and artists associated with the United States riot grrrl movement include Slant 6, Sta-Prest, Jenny Toomey, Tattle Tale, Jack Off Jill, the Need, Nomy Lamm, Lucid Nation, the Frumpies, Bangs, and the Quails; and in the United Kingdom, Blood Sausage, Mambo Taxi, Voodoo Queens, Pussycat Trash, Frantic Spiders, Linus, Sister George and Lungleg. Zines and publications Even as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international mainstream media attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon. Most musicians shunned the major record labels, devotedly working instead with indie labels such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, Slampt, Piao! Records, Simple Machines, Catcall, WIIIJA and Chainsaw Records. The movement also figured fairly prominently in cassette culture, with artists often starting their own DIY cassette labels by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf boom- boxes and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves. Riot grrrl's momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut and paste, xeroxed, collagey zines that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a \\"privately public\\" space. Zines often described experiences with sexism, mental illness, body image and eating disorders, sexual abuse, racism, rape, discrimination, stalking, domestic violence, incest, homophobia, and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.Comstock, Michelle. Grrl Zine Networks: Re-Composing Spaces of Authority, Gender, and Culture. La Jolla: n.p., September 3, 2013. PDF. These zines were archived by zinewiki.com, and Riot Grrrl Press, started in Washington DC in 1992 by Erika Reinstein & May Summer. Others can be found anthologized in A Girl's Guide to Taking over the World: Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution, for which actress/singer/musician/writer/performance artist Ann Magnuson of Bongwater fame wrote as a foreword: > When I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the > multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for > all the lost potential. Except for Joan of Arc and Anne Frank, the thoughts > of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously. Bands would often attempt to reappropriate derogatory phrases like \\"cunt\\", \\"bitch\\", \\"dyke\\", and \\"slut\\", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat markers. Kathleen Hanna was writing \\"slut\\" on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices. Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists. Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling. Many of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as Chainsaw by Donna Dresch, Sister Nobody, Jane Gets A Divorce and I (heart) Amy Carter by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C., or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like Don't Need You: the Herstory of Riot Grrrl. Starting during the fall of 2010, the \\"Riot Grrrl Collection\\" has been housed at New York University's Fales Library and Special Collections, as \\"The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection\\". The collection's primary mandate is \\"to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall\\". Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Becca Albee have donated primary source material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at Barnard College, \\"It's just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for\\". Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be \\"free from feminist erasure\\".  Criticism  The \\"Riot Grrrl\\" movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being separatists: they want to form a life away from men and invent \\"girl culture\\". One major argument is that the movement focuses on middle-class white women, alienating other kinds of women.Riot Girl Essex Zine #1, Essex, England. Available here . This criticism emerged early in the movement. In 1993, Ramdasha Bikceem wrote in her zine, Gunk, > Riot grrrl calls for change, but I question who it's including ... I see > Riot Grrrl growing very closed to a very few i.e. white middle class punk > girls. Musician Courtney Love has criticized the movement for being too doctrinaire and censorious: > Look, you've got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them > it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is > part of being in the real world. I'm offended every time I see George Bush > on TV! Some have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, some higher-profile riot grrrl bands participated in the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, a trans-exclusionary events that had a \\"womyn-born womyn\\" policy. Former members of Le Tigre did see protests at their shows for having participated in the festival in 2001. However, Kathleen Hanna has stated directly that she supports trans rights on her own Twitter account and her regret of her decision to perform at that festival. Additionally, JD Samson, another former member of Le Tigre, is a proponent of gender fluidity. The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, celebrated its last annual festival in 2015. The Advocate speculated that the decision was related ongoing controversy around the festival's decision to not admit transgender women. Legacy and resurgence Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 and Sleater-Kinney in 2005 In the foreword to the 2007 book, Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!, Beth Ditto writes of riot grrrl, > A movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, > hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of > strangers' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth > and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk. Additionally, Ditto writes about riot grrrl's influence on her personally and on her music. She muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, > Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another Gloria > Steinem NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a > musician, a writer, a whole person. Many women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, \\"Don‚Äôt revive it, make something better\\".Frere-Jones, Sasha. \\"Hanna And Her Sisters.\\" The New Yorker 26 Nov. 2012: n. pag. The New Yorker. The New Yorker, 26 Nov. 2012. Web. 03 Dec. 2015.http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/hanna-and-her-sisters In 2010 Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution became the first published history of the riot grrrl movement. The author had had also attended Riot Grrrl meetings herself. As of 2019 there were approximately ten weekly riot grrrl meetings held nationwide and bands multiplying faster than can be counted.leftIn 2013 Astria Suparak and Ceci Moss curated Alien She, an exhibition examining the impact of Riot Grrrl on artists and cultural producers. Alien She focuses on seven people whose visual art practices were informed by their contact with Riot Grrrl. Many of them work in multiple disciplines, such as sculpture, installation, video, documentary film, photography, drawing, printmaking, new media, social practice, curation, music, writing and performance‚Äîa reflection of the movement's artistic diversity and mutability. It opened September 2013 at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and ran through February the following year. It visited four subsequent art spaces (Vox Populi in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March ‚Äì April 2014; Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, October 2014 ‚Äì January 2015; Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California, February ‚Äì May 2015; and Pacific Northwest College of Art: 511 Gallery and the Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland, Oregon, September 3, 2015 ‚Äì January 9, 2016). The term \\"grrrl\\" (or \\"grrl\\") itself has since been co-opted or used by agencies as diverse as advocacy on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (GRRL POWER 1.0 5-PACK / Memetics for the Ladies) and a roller derby league in Singapore. The resurgence of riot grrrl is clearly visible in fourth-wave feminists worldwide who cite the original movement as an interest or influence on their lives and/or their work. Some of them are self-proclaimed riot grrrls while others consider themselves simply admirers or fans. In an age where Internet is the most accessible platform for individuals to express themselves, the fourth-wave riot grrrl community has risen in popularity in recent years. Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of intersectional oppression, but they also provide space for budding feminists to express smaller issues, such as the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. Young feminists have harnessed the internet as a forum for self-determinism and genuine, open expression: a core part of the riot grrrl message that allows young adults room to decide for themselves who they are. As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as Kitten Forever, Skating Polly, the Shondes and the Ethical Debating Society. Additionally, the riot grrrl movement has influenced an eclectic array of music genres and art in modern times. In January 2019, Bikini Kill announced their reunion tour for the first time since their last show in Tokyo 22 years ago. The Guardian stated in an article about reunion that the once-underground riot grrrl movement has gone mainstream due to word of mouth from celebrities and the increased attention to other modern feminist developments such as the Me Too movement. In the same article, drummer Tobi Vail stated her frustration with lack of social progress related to feminism.Ewens, Hannah. \\"Riot grrrl pioneers Bikini Kill: 'We're back. It's intense'\\" The Guardian. 9 Jan. 2019. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/09/bikini-kill-riot-grrrl-were- back-its-intense > These same issues still exist, being a woman in public is very intense, > whether it‚Äôs in the public eye or just walking down the street at night by > yourself. Vail also explained the aims of their reunion, that women discover the band and understand their history, especially those who did not have the opportunity to hear them during the original riot grrrl movement. > We‚Äôre doing it because we want to be a part of this conversation about what > feminism is in this moment.  Global Proliferation  Pussy Riot. Photo by Denis Bochkarev. Since its beginnings, the riot grrrl movement was attractive to many women in varied cultures. Its spread across the world established bands in Brazil, Paraguay, Israel, Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, and its globalization was also aided by the distribution of zines across Asia, Europe, and South America. The discovery of riot grrrl provided women across the globe with access to an outlet that challenged the dominant culture around female bodies through a form of self-expression that previously was often inaccessible to women in non-western nations. In addition to becoming a vehicle of expression for equality, bands in the genre affected the status quo of the music industry by challenging the gender norms that favoured male musicians. One of the most well-known bands to come out of the globalization of the riot grrrl movement is Pussy Riot, a Russian group who self-identifies as twenty-first century Russian riot grrrls. Pussy Riot first came to popular media attention in 2012 when they staged a protest performance of \\"Punk Prayer\\" at the altar of Moscow‚Äôs largest cathedral. The song includes lines such as, ‚ÄúHoly Mother, Blessed Virgin, chase Putin out!‚Äù All three members of Pussy Riot at the time were arrested by authorities and accused of hooliganism. Currently Pussy Riot performs music with themes of feminism, LGBT rights, and opposition to the policies of Russian president Vladimir Putin, whom the group considers to be a dictator. Pussy Riot embraces the ideals of riot grrrls by challenging the political climate they personally experience as well as the homophobic and patriarchal elements of everyday Russian life.

Description The icon is a painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary depicted as Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. The Virgin, in blue and red clothes, seems to be sitting on clouds above an image that appears to be purgatory. In her left arm, she carries the Infant Jesus and in her right hand, the cross of a 15 decade Rosary. The Infant Jesus is garbed in a light blue attire. In his right hand he holds a globe with a cross on top symbolizing his role as protector of the earth. In his right left hand he holds one end of the Rosary. Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish Church where the Marian image is enshrined The icon of the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary, Queen of the Caracol is painted on canvas and framed in wood with silver adornments of grapes and vines. The painting is set with gold accouterments. The most venerated icon is enthroned at the altar of the Parish of The Most Holy Rosary, also known as the Rosario Church, in the town of Rosario. History Rosario is a coastal town in the province of Cavite along the shores of Manila Bay. It was formerly a barrio or (barangay) of the town of San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias). It was then called Salinas-Marsella for its salt evaporation industry. Marsella, on the other hand, comes from the Spanish word ‚Äò‚Äômar‚Äô‚Äô (sea). It was named so because of its proximity to the sea. However, before the twilight of the Spanish era its name was changed to Rosario in honor of the ‚Äò‚ÄôVirgen del Rosario de Caracol‚Äô‚Äô which was the patroness of the place. How this virgin came to the town, nobody can tell the exact details. A plausible story was told by one of the most respected couple of Rosario ‚Äì Don Catalino Abueg and Dona Rosa Ner - as to how the virgin came to the town. During the Spanish colonial period, one of the best means of transportation was by boat. Cargoes from the south were brought to Manila by big boats, and there were many batel (fishing boats) in Manila bay. Many years ago, in a date which remained unremembered, a strong typhoon visited Manila and the area. It caused great destruction of life and properties especially to those who lived along the coastal areas of Manila bay. Countless fishermen as well as merchants were caught by the turbulent wind in the midst of the sea. One of these boats coming from Mindoro was loaded with merchandise. The furious wind and the terrifying lashes of rain hit the boat, with the waves in their wildest moments. Water started to fill the boat to the point that it was almost sinking. The crewmen of the boat, filled with terror as death approaches, tied themselves to the boat so they would not be thrown overboard. The head of the crew went inside the cabin to check whatever goods he could save. As he moved around, he noticed the framed image of the Lady of the Most Holy Rosary hanging on a post. A strong wind rocked the boat that made the frame swing to the point of almost being dropped in the water. The sight of the image gave him a little light of hope for safety. He beg the virgin to spare his life and that of his companions with the promise that they would build a chapel in her honor as soon as they landed on the shore. The Virgin must have heard his prayers for they were all saved. The stormy night was followed by a serene and sunny morning. They found themselves along the shore of Mojon now called Muzon, a sitio of the barrio of Salinas-Marsella. With great joy and gratitude, they built a chapel on a ground which was said to belong to a certain Lieutenant Felix Suasa. The makeshift chapel was made of bamboo and the lumber used for the altar of the Virgin was from their very own boat. There was a great feasting for the affair. The image was entrusted by the crewmen to the people of the Mojon. The crew of the boat left leaving a legacy, which became an undying tradition - the town fiesta in honor of the Virgin of the Most Holy Rosary. After sometime, the people felt that they should give a more beautiful and bigger home for the Virgin. Hence, from Muzon the shrine was transferred to the present site of the parish church and a more decent chapel was built. The altarpiece where the image is enshrined. Historically, there is no exact data or record as to when she became the patroness of Rosario. On April 21, 1984, Tony Nazareno, the president of the Antique Dealers Association of the Philippines came to examine the painting of the Virgin Mary. According to him, the image is a product of a Filipino brush. The face of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary is very Filipina, a rare piece in the Philippine iconography. He believed that the style of the painting belonged to a well-known painter, Faustino Quiotang, and suggested that the icon was painted sometime between 1810 and 1820. The parish and the town of Rosario was established on October 22, 1845 as promulgated by Governor-General Narciso Claveria. Devotion The icon of our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary at the altarpiece. The town fiesta of Rosario or the feast of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary is celebrated twice a year, the first is in the month of May held during the third Sunday of the month. In some instances, it is moved to the fourth Sunday when it is close in proximity to the fiesta of Saint Isidore the Laborer. The second is on October 7 to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. The festivities include the ritual dance-procession called \\"caracol\\" (also spelled \\"karakol\\", meaning \\"prayer through dancing\\" or \\"pasayaw na pananalangin\\"), also danced in other festivals within the province of Cavite and thus serves as the local equivalent of Manila's Buling-Buling of the district of Pandacan. During the eve of the fiesta, the Virgin is placed on a float or andas during the dance-procession, which is then carried on the shoulders by her devotees (mostly male). The two-tiered float is heavily decorated with curtains and flowers. From the church, majority of those who participate in the Caracol procession also dances to the lively tune of \\"Pandanggo\\" or any Philippine folk music provided by the town's brass marching bands, hired to provide musical accompaniment to the procession or via sound trucks blasting recorded music. The float of the Virgin Mary is also swayed to the music while it is being paraded around town.Reyes, Julius (2014-05-27). \\"Rosario Town Fiesta 2014\\". YouTube. Retrieved on 2014-11-03. Together with the dancing, the procession is a slow snail-like pace (the origin of the word \\"caracol\\", the Spanish word for snail). The image of the Virgin Mary is brought towards the shore of Manila Bay for a fluvial procession. Once the dance-procession reaches the seashore, the image of the Virgin is then boarded on a big fishing boat. While at the sea, hundreds of smaller fishing boats go around the Marian boat as veneration to the Virgin. Music is provided by the brass band also loaded on their boats. Adding color to the fluvial parade, participating boats displays different colorful banners during the fluvial parade. From Barangay Wawa, The image is brought to Barangay Muzon where it lands. From Muzon, the Virgin is once again brought back to the church with the \\"Karakol sa lupa\\" or \\"land Caracol\\". This Caracol caught the attention of the committee on the Marian procession in Intramuros. In December 1982, the Virgin and the people of Rosario were invited to participate in the annual Grand Marian Procession in Intramuros. People applauded as the Virgin and her devotees danced to the joyful tune of the ‚ÄúPandanggo‚Äù. Even the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines that time, the Most Reverend Bruno Torpigiliani, D.D. was deeply touched by the scene. Hence, he commented that this was the first time he witnessed such a deep and strong filial devotion to the Blessed Mother.

He was the first horse to win the Hong Kong Vase after winning the Melbourne Cup. Early life and racing career The horse was purchased for ‚Ç¨1,500 as a foal at the Arqana mixed December sale in France in 2006. The foal was purchased by Dutch owner/breeder Jetty van der Hulst and grew up at her stud in Nederweert (The Netherlands). As a 3-year-old he was claimed out of her stable after winning in France. Dunaden showed his Melbourne Cup credentials in early 2011 with a win in the Prix de Barbeville and a second in the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier. He prepared for the Melbourne Cup in Australia by winning the Geelong Cup. In the Melbourne Cup, he settled back in the running and finished down the middle of the track, hitting the line alongside Red Cadeaux in the closest photo-finish ever in the Melbourne Cup, winning by 5‚Äì10 cm. He went on to win the prestigious Hong Kong Vase a few weeks later with Red Cadeaux coming home in third.

Upon completing the review and finding the entire crew lackluster, Hermes determines he is the worst-performing employee, spending too much time reviewing performance. He fires himself and has the Central Bureaucracy replace him with a robot to handle the accounting for Planet Express. Hermes begins to feel useless.

The crew learns that Zoidberg has been getting Hermes' discarded parts and stitched his body up to use as a ventriloquist dummy named Little Hermes, turning it into a comedy act which impresses everyone but offends Hermes, who feels he needs to replace his brain with a computer. When Yuri does not want to do the brain replacement, Hermes, Professor Farnsworth, and Bender head to the robot graveyard to exhume a robot body for a processor.

He received the Order of Canada in 1972 for his conservation efforts, See video. and is the namesake of the Edwards Range mountains. Edwards and his family were celebrated in a number of books and films, including Leland Stowe's best-selling Crusoe of Lonesome Lake (1957), which led to Edwards being the surprise honoree on the 1957 Christmas Day edition of This Is Your Life. Biography =Early life= Edwards was born around 1891‚Äì92 in the mountains of North Carolina. After a few years he moved with his medical- missionary parents to India where he spent three years in the foothills of the Himalayas, until the age of eight, coming to love the mountains. He then returned to North Carolina for two years of school, and then to Massachusetts where he lived with his great-uncle helping him on his farm, developing a love of farming. In his mid-teens he moved to Oregon, where his nomadic parents had settled. At age 16, he found work in British Columbia on a railroad construction crew. Edwards' deep interest in farming and mountains came together when he learned he could get free land in British Columbia as part of a state homesteading program. Between the ages of 17 and 21, he taught himself how to be a farmer using books and working as a farmhand. In 1913, at the age of 21, he was granted a 160-acre tract in the Atnarko valley on the eastern edge of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia. =Farm and family= Edwards chose a location for the farm forty-miles walk from the nearest human settlement, deep in the mountains over a treacherous trail on the far end of Lonesome Lake (which Edwards named), in what is today Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park. Winters were long, snowy and very cold. Dangerous wild animals such as grizzly bears and bobcats were everywhere. He spent the first decade alone, clearing towering virgin forests of cedar trees with hand tools, building a multistory log home, shooting and trapping game. He rarely left the farm, and could only bring in from the outside what he could carry on his back and packhorse over a difficult mountainous trail, which took at least two days to traverse. Edwards named the farm \\"The Birches\\". In 1917, he enlisted with the United States Army as a radio operator, and fought in World War I with the Fourth Division's 8th Field Signal Battalion, serving at the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry and later with occupation forces on the Rhine. He was discharged nine months after the armistice, and returned to The Birches. In 1923, he married a local girl, Ethel Hober, and they raised three children on the farm: Stanley, Johnny and the youngest, daughter Trudy. The children were schooled through a correspondence system, and had access to Ralph's extensive home library. The Edwards family became locally renowned for their pioneering self-sufficiency and DIY ethic. Since it required so much effort to bring material in from the outside they tried to make as much as they could from scratch. Beyond such things as making their own shoes and spinning wool into clothing, accomplishments included a water-powered saw mill, and even an electric-generator powered by the river, enough to keep a single light-bulb going at night. He studied for a decade to build an airplane, teaching himself advanced mathematics and aeronautic engineering, although in the end he was forced to buy a used plane due to legal restrictions. His daughter Trudy learned to fly the plane first, then, the age of 62, Edwards obtained his pilot's license after only 28 hours of instruction; at the time, he was the oldest pilot in Canada to ever qualify. During his physical his doctor said he was healthier than men half his age. Over the years, as Edwards' farm and family prospered, the legend of his accomplishments spread. In 1956, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Leland Stowe visited The Birches for 12 days on assignment with Reader's Digest. From his interviews with Edwards, Stowe wrote a biography called Crusoe of Lonesome Lake (1957). Stowe saw Edwards as a modern-day Robinson Crusoe, self-sufficiently carving a bountiful existence out of harsh but beautiful land. The book sold well, and Edwards became somewhat famous thereafter. Popular interest was such that Edwards was the honoree on the 1957 Christmas Day edition of This Is Your Life, hosted by Ralph Edwards (no relation). Guests for the show included his younger brother, whom he had not seen in 35 years; former Army comrades he had not seen in 38 years; and his 93-year-old mother. Alternate link. =Final years and postscript= Edwards separated from his wife in 1965, having sold The Birches to American buyers against her will. Edith arranged with the buyers that she could continue to live there; their elder son, Stanley, who had left Lonesome Lake at seventeen, returned to live with his mother, and their younger son, John, eventually repurchased it. Edwards then took up commercial ocean fishing in his 70s, and for the remainder of his days lived in Prince Rupert. He died in 1977 of cancer. By the time Edith Edwards died, nobody was living at The Birches, and the property had begun to deteriorate back to nature. John Edwards made efforts to restore the farm beginning in the late 1980s, but all the buildings on the property burned to the ground in a forest fire in July‚ÄìAugust 2004, and John died in 2007. A documentary called Crusoe of Lonesome Lake was filmed in 1988 by Tony Wade, featuring footage of the historic property and buildings before the fire. Trumpeter swans Trumpeter swans at WWT London Wetland Centre, England When Edwards first arrived, Lonesome Lake was home to a gaggle of trumpeter swan refugees, a species facing extinction due to over-hunting in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The lake's remoteness offered the swans safety, but at the cost of starvation during severe winters. In 1925, the Canadian government enlisted Edwards' help to feed the swans during winter. Over the years, a number of family members took on the task ‚Äì first Ralph, then Stan, John, and Trudy ‚Äì using sacks of corn which were hauled in by packhorse. During Princess Elizabeth's 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, by arrangement of British conservationist Peter Scott, who was head of the Severn Wildlife Trust in Britain (now known as the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust). Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake as they had been fed by Edwards family for decades. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy Turner (Trudy had by now entirely taken over the feeding of them), five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although, in the 19th century, the swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One later died, and the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge. The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles the WWT President. In 1972, Edwards received the Order of Canada (Medal of Service) ‚Äì the highest Canadian award for conservation ‚Äì for his work with the swans. By the 1980s, trumpeter swan populations had increased throughout their range, and the Canadian government stopped its feeding program. Many of the swans cared for by the Edwards family subsequently died of starvation, but others found new homes elsewhere in less cold and remote areas. It is unclear how effective the Edwards' feeding program was in the end, but the species today is better protected from hunting, and is no longer considered endangered.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode centers on Regina's (Lana Parrilla) efforts to run Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) out of Storybrooke and reveals how the Evil Queen (Parrilla) unleashed her curse upon the Enchanted Forest. The episode was co-written by co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, while Greg Beeman directed. Actress Kristin Bauer van Straten was cast at the last minute and guest starred as the sorceress Maleficent, a character from Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Mary Margaret's (Ginnifer Goodwin) loft as well as most of the interior shots of the episode were filmed in Vancouver, while many exterior shots were shot in nearby Steveston, British Columbia. Series regular Josh Dallas appears only in archive footage. \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" first aired in the United States on ABC on October 30, 2011. It was watched by an estimated 11.64 million viewers, scoring a 3.9 ratings share in the 18-49 demographic. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics; many were complimentary towards Emma and Regina's feud and thought the episode was superior to the pilot, but believed Bauer van Straten was underused. A novelization of the episode was published in 2013. Plot =Opening sequence= Maleficent's unicorn is shown galloping through the forest. =In the characters' past= At the wedding of Snow White (Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas), the Evil Queen (Parrilla) announces her plan to cast a terrible curse on everyone. Despite the misgivings of the Magic Mirror (Esposito) and her valet (Tony Perez), she goes to see the sorceress Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), to whom she had traded a Dark Curse. Maleficent refuses to return the curse, but the Queen defeats her in a magical battle, taking the curse's scroll. She lets Maleficent live, stating that the sorceress is the only friend she has. Later in the forest, the Queen assembles a number of dark creatures. She demands a lock of hair from each of the assembly in order to cast the curse and sacrifices the heart of her prized stallion to complete the spell. The curse, however, fails. To find out why the curse failed, the Queen turns to Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle), the original owner of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person in the new world and promises that she will do anything he asks so long as he says \\"please.\\" The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there is something else the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse. On returning to her castle, the Queen is distraught over what Rumpelstiltskin told her. She confides in her valet, who is revealed to be her father. Knowing he is the thing the Queen loves the most, her father tries to dissuade her from her plan, saying that she could still find love again. Appearing to be persuaded, the Queen pulls her father in for an embrace, then kills him and removes his heart, and immediately starts crying. Alone in the forest, the Queen uses her father's heart to complete the Dark Curse. As the curse takes shape, she lays a black rose on her father's grave. The headstone bears the inscription \\"Henry, Beloved Father.\\" =In Storybrooke= Around Storybrooke, residents notice the clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Parrilla) looks through the book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing because it is an old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident (where she crashed into the \\"Welcome to Storybrooke\\" sign after trying to avoid hitting a wolf, and was believed to have been drunk driving), which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past. Henry tells Emma that he has a plan for them to break the curse, called \\"Operation Cobra\\". The first step is to associate his book's characters with each of the Storybrooke residents, as no one can remember their past. Henry explains to a skeptical Emma that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Concerned about Henry, Emma goes to see his therapist, Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge). She is willingly given Henry's file, only to be arrested when Archie claims she stole it. Regina unsuccessfully tries to use the incident to divide Emma and Henry. Emma retaliates by attacking Regina's apple tree with a chainsaw, provoking another confrontation. Back at the inn, Granny (Beverley Elliott) apologetically kicks Emma out, telling her they have a no-felons policy. Regina suggests to Emma that they meet at her office to make peace. Once there, Emma tells Regina that she does not plan to take Henry away, but that she is worried about Henry's sanity because of his \\"crazy\\" fairy-tale theory. Henry overhears Emma and runs away, hurt. Regina acknowledges that she knew Henry would arrive just in time to hear their conversation. Emma later tells Henry that she thinks the curse is crazy, but that does not mean it is not true. She also tells him that in order to break the curse, they must keep Regina off their trail by making her think that they don't believe in the curse. As Regina tends the apple tree, Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) offers to help Regina get rid of Emma, for a price. Regina says that she is not in the business of making deals with him anymore, and Gold acknowledges that she had made a deal with him in the past to procure Henry. He asks Regina how she chose the name Henry; she does not answer. She questions him about Emma's past, and he is equally evasive. When Gold attempts to walk away, Regina presses him for an answer, causing Gold to say \\"please\\", forcing Regina to obey. As Gold walks away, Regina watches in shock and worry, suggesting that she suspects that Gold remembers their lives in the Enchanted Forest. Production As with the pilot, \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive producer Greg Beeman served as director. The episode focuses on the rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know what is best for Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a \\"vulnerable\\" side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, \\"What I‚Äôve been trying to show is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It‚Äôs not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You‚Äôll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well.\\" As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that \\"she may have a cold heart, but I think she really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn‚Äôt think of him as an adopted son, she thinks of him as her son.\\" Kristin Bauer van Straten guest starred as Maleficent In September 2011, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Kristin Bauer van Straten would be guest starring as Maleficent, a character from Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. She was cast at the last minute, which she felt made her performance more instinctual because of the lack of prep time. The actress described Maleficent as being the Evil Queen's \\"frenemy,\\" as each has been \\"kind of helping [the] other and playing this chess game for years.\\" Bauer van Straten noted the similarities between Once Upon a Time and her HBO series True Blood character Pam, and said that she enjoyed the \\"evil-bitch typecasting\\". She added that the elaborate purple costume helped her get into character, making her feel \\"slightly evil.\\" \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" is the first episode to feature Mary Margaret's loft, which is filmed on a small sound stage in Vancouver; most of the first season's interior shots are also filmed in the city, while many exterior shots are of nearby Steveston, British Columbia. The production team led by set decorator Mark Lane and production designer Michael Joy designed the residence to seem \\"locked in time a little bit, so there's not a lot of new stuff.\\" They included working class antiques such as a Hoosier cabinet, an old gas stove, and a Bakelite radio. The loft was meant to be located above a store and near a lumber mill and water, so the crew also designed it to feel like a fish cannery. The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale ‚Äì a novelization of the first season ‚Äì which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Reception =Ratings= The episode was first broadcast on October 30, 2011. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by an estimated 11.64 million viewers and received a 3.9 ratings share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, and even though it was down a tenth from its debut, it retained its lead in its timeslot and was the only ABC show to have the most viewers tuned in that evening. It ranked third in its timeslot behind Football Night In America on NBC and 60 Minutes on CBS but it beat The Simpsons on the Fox network. On November 3, ABC ordered a full season in part based on the success of \\"The Thing You Love Most\\", the second episode of the series. In Canada, the episode was watched by an estimated 1.44 million viewers, finishing in twenty-second place for the week. =Reviews= The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. IGN's Amy Ratcliffe rated \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" with a score of 7.5 out of 10, describing it as \\"fun\\" with \\"not impressive but not horrible\\" special effects and a story that was \\"enjoyable and entertaining but not gripping.\\" Ratcliffe enjoyed the interactions between Emma and Regina, but commented that she \\"could do with less of Regina's withering stares\\" and \\"precious apples.\\" She also found the change of music when switching to the fairy tale realm to be \\"an unnecessary bat over the head.\\" Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A‚Äì. While she liked Bauer van Straten's performance, McLennan wished that her character had been \\"fiercer\\" in her first appearance. Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy thought it was more fun than the pilot and praised Morrison's \\"tough-as-nails-but-with-a- secret-heart-of-gold\\" performance, as well as her character's feud with Regina. Writing for The A.V. Club, Oliver Sava criticized the episode for possessing \\"the same problems as the pilot: It takes itself too seriously, the flashbacks are hilariously campy, and Henry is a horribly obnoxious character in an unfortunately central role.\\" In addition to giving a negative opinion of the episode's CGI, Sava opined that Bauer van Staten was misused and disliked Gilmore's performance, but praised Esposito's. He gave the episode a \\"C\\". TV Fanatic's Christine Orlando was more positive, and gave the episode 4.6 out of 5 stars, saying that \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" was \\"a great second outing\\" for the series. She complimented the production design and applauded the conflict between Emma and Regina, citing her favorite scene as \\"when Emma took a chainsaw to the Regina's beloved apple tree.\\" Like Sava, Orlando thought that Maleficent was underused and criticized her hair and the scene for its poor special effects.

The west end is in Exton (Chester County), while the east end is in King of Prussia (Montgomery County). Phase 1 of the trail was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Phase 2 of the trail's construction has begun in an attempt to connect the trail's three sections, adding .  Historical development  The Chester Valley Rail Trail enjoys a rich history closely connected to a number of American Revolutionary War parks and monuments. The trail runs through Battle of the Clouds Park, a site known for a battle between the armies of General Washington and General Cornwallis in September 1777 in which torrential downpour spoiled the colonial troops' black powder and forced them to retreat prior to fully engaging the British. Additionally, the trail travels within a few miles of the site of the Paoli massacre. Phase 2 of the trail project will connect to the Schuylkill River Trail, providing a link to Valley Forge National Historic Park. Trail construction The Chester Valley Rail Trail idea began in 1991 when Conrail abandoned the former Reading Company Chester Valley Branch, whose route connected the towns of Bridgeport and Downingtown. As there were two parallel railway lines within a mile from the route (built by competitor the Pennsylvania Railroad), Conrail considered the Chester Valley Branch redundant and had abandoned most of the route by 1991. A remnant of the branch (from Bridgeport to King of Prussia) survived until May 2011 when short line operator East Penn Railroad abandoned it; this stretch will be incorporated into Phase 2. Authorities from Chester and Montgomery counties, in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) looked to convert the road bed into a walking trail. In 2009, PennDOT hired C. Abbonizio Contractors to construct Phase 1 of the trail for $3.2 million. Construction on Phase 2 of the trail began in August 2011. =Design and construction= The paved trail is wide with an approximately wide right-of- way. The trail's unpaved section near the Great Valley Corporate Center is crushed stone. On May 27, 2010, a truss bridge was built over Church Road in East Whiteland Township. Parking and restrooms are provided at each of the trail's two trailheads. A number of parks, including the Battle of the Clouds Park and Valley Creek Park, are adjacent to the trail.

The number \\"16\\" was used in recognition of the two wartime airborne divisions. The division had three parachute brigades, the 4th, 5th and the 6th, each with three Territorial battalions of the Parachute Regiment. The brigades were renumbered the 44th, 45th and 46th in 1950. Then in December 1955, the British Secretary of State for War in an announcement on the future of the Territorial Army, proposed cutting the Territorial parachute battalions by five. The reduction in strength led to the disbandment of the division in 1956, leaving the 44th Independent Parachute Group (TA) as the only British reserve parachute formation.

Early life Igga is variously described to stem from the Bari and Zande ethnic groups and he is a Roman Catholic. He studied economics in Cairo. Civil war years Igga joined the South Sudanese rebels in 1985, training in Cuba and Ethiopia. He rose through the SPLA ranks rapidly, and by 1987 Igga had the rank of Major and commanded the Shakus Battalion. The same year he served as Zonal Commander of Central Equatoria and as a member of the SPLA High Command. Igga was reportedly well- respected among civilians. Igga was one of the SPLA's most senior representatives during negotiations with SPLA-Nasir. He represented Garang as the head of the SPLA-Torit delegation at peace talks in Nairobi in November 1991. In 1993 Igga accompanied Garang to Nairobi for a peacemaking seminar in June 1993, and to Kampala for an IGAD-mediated dialog with the Nasir faction. Igga had known Lam Akol, one of the Nasir leaders, since their time together in the Cuban training camp. As chairman of the SPLM Political Affairs Commission, Igga established the Technical Committee of Intellectuals in February 2000. This Committee was tasked with planning the civil administration of Southern Sudan. Postwar Politics Following the 2005 signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement establishing the autonomy of Southern Sudan, Igga was in charge transitioning the SPLM from an insurgent strategic leadership to a political party. He was chosen as the speaker of Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly in 2005, and he continued in that office until independence in 2011. In addition, Igga was appointed caretaker governor of Upper Nile State for the transition period. Igga read out the proclamation of independence when the Sudans divided. Igga continued as the legislative speaker of the lower house from 2011 to 2013. President Salva Kiir appointed Igga as vice president on 23 August 2013 to replace Riek Machar, whom he had dismissed a month previously. He will be required to resign as speaker. Igga was unanimously confirmed by the National Assembly on 26 August. On 19 August 2020, six of Igga's bodyguards were killed in a road ambush by NAS rebels in Igga's home town of Lobonok. However, Igga was not with those bodyguards at the time.

It began with a 1976 journal article by Robert Brenner. Historians Trevor Aston and C. H. E. Philpin (1985) characterised the debate as 'one of the most important historical debates of recent years'.Trevor Aston and C. H. E. Philpin, 'Preface', in The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe, ed. by Trevor Aston and C.H.E. Philpin, Past and Present Publications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. vii. Background The debate has been seen as a successor to the so- called \\"transition debate\\" (or Dobb-Sweezy debate) that followed Maurice Dobb's 1946 Studies in the Development of Capitalism,Chris Harman, 'The Rise of Capitalism', International Socialism Journal, 102 (Spring 2004). and Paul Sweezy's 1950 article \\"The Transition From Feudalism To Capitalism\\"), in the journal Science & Society. (These articles were subsequently collected and published as a book, also entitled The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism, in 1976.The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism, ed. by R. H. Hilton (London: Verso, 1976).

Past & Present 70 (1976), pp. 30‚Äì74  The debate Brenner's thesis was the focus of a symposium in around 1977, several contributions to which also appeared in the pages of Past & Present. Brenner's article and the discussions that followed it have a broad significance for understanding the origins of capitalism, and were foundational to so-called \\"Political Marxism\\".Ellen Meiksins Wood, The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View, 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), esp. pp. 50‚Äì64. In 1978, Michael Postan and John Hatcher characterised the debate as attempting to determine whether Malthusian cyclic explanations of population and development or social class explanations governed demographic and economic change in Europe.M. M. Postan, John Hatcher, \\"Population and Class relations in Feudal society\\" Past & Present 78 (1) 24‚Äì25 The debate challenged the prevalent views of regarding class relations in the economy of England in the Middle Ages in particular ‚Äì and agricultural societies with serfdom in general, as well as engaging the broader historiography of the economics of feudalism from the 20th century (in both the west and the Soviet Union). Even though Brenner's key ideas have not achieved consensus,Shami Ghosh, 'Rural Economies and Transitions to Capitalism: Germany and England Compared (c.1200‚Äìc.1800)', The Journal of Agrarian Change, 16.2 (April 2016), 255‚Äì90, DOI: 10.1111/joac.12096. the debate has remained influential in 21st century scholarship,Peasants into Farmers?

In the view of Shami Ghosh, Brenner's thesis proposed an explanatory framework for the evolution of what he called \\"agrarian capitalism\\", in England, during the 15th and 16th centuries. > [A] transformation of relationships between landlords and cultivators led to > the creation of a largely free and competitive market in land and labour, > while simultaneously dispossessing most of the peasants. Thus from the old > class divisions of owners of land on the one hand, and an unfree peasantry > with customary rights of use to land on the other, a new tripartite > structure came into being, comprising landlords, free tenant farmers on > relatively short-term market-determined leases and wage labourers; this > Brenner defines as ‚Äòagrarian capitalism‚Äô.
