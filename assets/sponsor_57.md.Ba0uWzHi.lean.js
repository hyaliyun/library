Life for the siblings is harsh, with the engaging, nature-loving teenager yearning for stability. Richard frequently finds himself on the wrong side of Polly's destructive, often violent moods. Richard finds it easier to communicate with animals ‚Äì none more so than his beloved hen, Fiona. He forms a strong friendship with rebellious seventeen-year-old Annabel, whose family have recently acquired the farmland on which the brothers live.

The WS51200 is one of the largest in the WS family of transport trucks and TELs. The size of the WS51200 allows it to carry intercontinental ballistic missiles. Despite being made in China, North Korea remains the only users of these vehicles. Description The WS51200 is a large 16x12 special wheeled transporter erector launcher which used some technology from the Belarusian Minsk Automobile Plant. Its large size allows the WS51200 to carry extremely heavy loads of up to 80 tons. As such, the WS51200 could easily mount a nuclear-tipped ICBM. Unlike smaller Chinese TELs from Wanshan Special Vehicle, the WS51200 uses and is powered by the Cummins KTTA19-C700 turbocharged diesel engine rather than the German-made Deutz turbocharged diesel engine. This more powerful engine gives the WS51200 700 hp and a maximum range of a 1,000 km. The TEL has a steerable on both its first 3 axles and its last 3 axles, which significantly reduces turning radius and makes it surprisingly maneuverable despite its size. North Korean Controversy The WS51200 is noted due to controversy surrounding its involvement in the development and modernization of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile program. According to the United States Treasury, it accused Wanshan Special Vehicle for covertly aiding the DPRK in terms of its mobile ballistic missile capability. China denies responsibility. In 2011, it is reported that eight WS51200 was exported to North Korea under the guise of it being a lumber transport in order to avoid UN sanctions. North Korea currently uses the WS51200 to mount the Hwasong-13 and the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missiles.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History Dr. Francis J . Morse was one of a string of doctors who owned a drugstore in Constantine. He was active in village affairs, being a school trustee in 1859-62, ans helping organize the First State Bank in 1864. In 1864, he purchased the lots on which this house stands, and had it constructed in about 1864/65. Morse deeded the property to Mary E. Eacker in 1878, who then deeded it to Jennie H. Scoville in 1881. Jennie Scoville was the wife of Dr. Bela P. Scoville, a Civil War veteran who had completed medical school at the University of Michigan in 1868. Scoville set up a medical practice in Mottville after graduation, and there married Jennie Hutchinson in 1880. After their marriage, Bela and Jennie Hutchinson Scoville moved to Constantine into this house. They lived here until their deaths: Bela in 1917 and Jennie in 1936. The Scovilles had one son, Charles T. Scoville. The house remained in the Scoville family until 1974.

She was nicknamed Belle of Mosul.  Personal life  Wenzel was born into a Christian family and grew up in the small German town of Pulsnitz, near Dresden and the Czech border, sharing a house with her mother and step-father. Wenzel moved to Pulsnitz following her mother's divorce. She attended the local Ernst-Rietschel comprehensive school and was particularly interested in mathematics, chemistry, and physics.  Radicalization  In the beginning of 2016 classmates of Wenzel noticed a change in her behavior, when Wenzel starting listening to Arabic music and asked the headmaster for permission to wear a headscarf at school. In the spring of 2016 Wenzel told her parents of her growing interest of Islam, but did not reveal that she had converted and had become a Muslim. During Ramadan, she told her family she was on a diet. Her parents accepted her interests, saying \\"we didn‚Äôt think anything of it, and even bought her a copy of the Qur'an\\". Wenzel had apparently been approached by Islamists online, who convinced her to convert. However, according to the mayor of Pulsnitz, the school was aware of the conversion months before, and the school principal talked to the parents about it. According to Wenzel, she was groomed online by a Jordanian teenager named Fatema who convinced her to convert to Islam and introduced her future husband, former ISIS fighter Abu Usama al-Shisani, whom she subsequently married via a phone conversation. On Friday 1 July 2016, she told her mother she would be back on the following Sunday at 4 o'clock, feigning spending the weekend a friend's house. However, the friend knew nothing of Wenzel's whereabouts. Hidden under the mattress in her room police later found receipts for two tickets from Dresden to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Istanbul that were purchased with fake authorization from her mother's account and her mother's passport.  Islamic State  Arriving in Syria she married a Chechen fighter serving the Islamic State, after which she traveled to Syria and then onward to Mosul to fight for the Islamic State, apparently before the October 2016 start of the Battle of Mosul. Her husband was killed in the beginning of the Battle of Mosul. Some have speculated that she may have served as a sniper, and was alleged to have admitted that she killed Iraqi soldiers. During the siege of Mosul she suffered a gunshot wound to her left thigh, and an additional wound to her right knee from a helicopter attack. Wenzel was also believed to have been a member of the Al-Khansaa Brigade, which is responsible for enforcing the Islamic State's Islamic morality code, inflicting punishments such as whipping for Sharia violations such as women wearing makeup or failing to cover themselves in accordance to the Islamic State's standards. On 18 July 2017, she was captured in Mosul by Iraqi troops along with four other German women. She had a malnourished baby boy, who is presumed to be her son, with her at the time. Due to her inability to converse in Arabic, Iraqi troops had at first mistaken her for a Yazidi woman, despite having refused any help offered by the Iraqi army. Footage of her capture, in which she was seen screaming and crying as she was being dragged by Iraqi forces, was disseminated a couple of weeks following her capture. On 15 December 2017 Wenzel was able to meet with her family in Baghdad while awaiting trial. On 22 May 2018 Wenzel was sentenced to 5 years in prison.  Captivity in Iraq  Wenzel and three other German women were formally charged by Iraqi authorities. Subsequently, German diplomats have attempted to avert death penalty charges and sentencing for Wenzel, and were reportedly confident in their ability to avert such a sentence while saying she would be expected to serve a long jail sentence. However, Iraqi then-Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on 18 September 2017 that Wenzel may face the death penalty by hanging, as: Wenzel has denied the charges against her saying that she was a housemaid. According to Wenzel, Islamic State authorities refused her requested return to Germany following the death of her husband, and provided her with a month's $200 widow's allowance. Under Iraqi law, Wenzel could have been sentenced to death; however the execution would not take place until she reached the age of 22. The media reported on 18 February 2018 that she was sentenced to a prison term of 6 years, including five years for being an ISIL member and a year for entering Iraq illegally.

Construction of wire-spoked wheels is generally termed as wheelbuilding, so wheel construction refers to construction of non-wire wheels, e.g. wheels of cars and other heavier vehicles. Wheels are constructed in a wide variety of designs using different materials, but in the early 21st century, aluminum and steel are most often used, with steel-made wheels being heavier and more durable than aluminum wheels. The performance of a wheel depends on the alloy and technique used to construct it. A wheel is usually made up of a rim, which connects with the tire, and a central disc, also known as the disc or spider, which connects the wheel to the vehicle. Wheels are usually of two types: semi-drop center (SDC), used in trucks, and drop center (DC), used in other vehicles. History of wheel construction The wheel is one of the most important inventions, but its inventor and exact date of invention are not yet known. The oldest known wheel was excavated from Mesopotamia, believed to be 5500 years old. This earliest wheel was a potter's wheel, used in the city of Ur in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), invented by Mesopotamians (also known as Sumerians) around 3500 BCE. The earliest known use of the wheel for transportation is in Mesopotamian chariots about 3200 years ago. Egyptians developed wheels with spokes about 2000 years ago, followed by Europeans some 1400 years ago. Another source says the oldest wheel used for transportation, with a radius of 27.5 inches (70 centimeters), was discovered in 2002, about 12.5 miles (20 kilometres) south west of Ljubljana in Slovenia, and is believed to be 5200 years old. Methods of single-piece wheel construction Most wheels are single-piece wheels, made using casting, forging, rim rolling and/or high light methods. =Casting= In casting, wheels are made by using a mold. The mold is filled with molten metal; as the metal cools, the wheel becomes strong and rigid. Various types of casting processes result in wheels with different properties. Gravity casting and low-pressure casting are common types of casting. Gravity casting In gravity casting, metal is poured into a mold and gravity alone causes the molten metal to fill the mold. This method is simple and low-cost, but aluminum cast this way will not be as dense as with other casting methods. Wheels constructed by this method are therefore made slightly heavier to achieve equivalent strength. Low-pressure casting In this method, molten aluminum is pumped into molds at heightened speed, which increases pressure and prevents formation of bubbles. Low- pressure casting is most common type of wheel casting because of the strength and quality of wheels formed by this method. =Forging= The forging method is considered best for making single-piece wheels because the wheels made using this method are both lightweight and strong. In this method, a stronger and denser wheel is produced by shaping an aluminum billet under high heat and at about 900 bars of pressure. =Rim-rolling= In this method, simple casting and a special rolling machine are used to construct wheels. The desired wheel is molded by heating its outer portion, with pressure provided by spinning the unfinished wheel, and sculpting the wheel using specialized rollers. This method creates a wheel similar in quality to forged wheels, but at a lower cost. OEM (original equipment manufacturing) wheels constructed by this method are used in special performance vehicles. =High light technology= This method is used to construct light wheels of racing vehicles. In this method, the material is compressed using rollers along a low-pressure aluminum barrel, which gives it its required shape and form. Methods of multi-piece wheel construction Two- or three-piece wheels, also known as multi-piece wheels, are assembled from pieces constructed separately by the methods mentioned above. Bolts or welding, or both, can be used to assemble the separate parts of such wheels.

A first class honours graduate of the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering, she began working in Formula One with Scuderia Ferrari at its headquarters in 2012 as a race strategist. Buscombe later moved to Haas in November 2015 to become the team's strategy engineer. She left Haas in June 2016 and was employed by Sauber three months later, helping the team to finish overtake Manor Racing in the Constructors' Championship. Buscombe is an ambassador for Dare to be Different. Biography =Early life and education= In an interview with The Guardian in 2017, Buscombe describes her childhood as going from \\"wanting to be a princess, to being an astronaut to wanting to be in F1\\", having become interested in motor racing at age 11. She was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow. Buscombe's teachers attempted to discourage her from a career in engineering because they questioned why she wanted to work in a male-dominated industry. At age 18, she narrowly avoided being killed in a road accident. Buscombe went to the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering to study Aerospace and Aerothermal Engineering. Her master's thesis was on the effect of the drag reduction system and was conducted in conjunction with motorsport's governing body, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile, with supervision from former Jaguar team principal Tony Purnell. Buscombe graduated with a first class honours degree in 2012. =Career= Immediately after graduation, Buscombe entered Formula One with the Scuderia Ferrari team in 2012 as a simulation development engineer where she developed and implemented algorithms. She was promoted to the role of a race strategist in March 2013 and worked at Ferrari's headquarters in Maranello. Buscombe oversaw the strategic decisions for driver Felipe Massa and later Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen from the factory's remote garage. She remained with Ferrari throughout 2015 before leaving at the end of the season to join first-year team Haas F1 in November as their strategy engineer. Buscombe was now working at the tracks and on the pitwall. She joined the Dare to be Different campaign in February 2016. Buscombe's strategy allowed lead driver Romain Grosjean to claim two successive top six finishes in the season's first two races in Australia and Bahrain. Following speculation of a disagreement, she left Haas in June 2016. Following its purchase by Longbow Finance the following month, Sauber employed several new personnel as part of a recruitment drive with Buscombe being hired by the team in September and started her new job at the Malaysian Grand Prix. She formulated a strategy to allow Felipe Nasr to finish ninth in the Brazilian race, which saw Sauber overtake Manor Racing tenth in the Constructors' Championship.

Anthony Memorial Committee of California. Early life and family Una Richardson was born in Big Spring, Wisconsin, on December 29, 1872, the daughter of Newell Richardson and Grace Holmes (died April 11, 1928). She had two brothers, Earl Holmes Richardson and J. Roy Richardson. Earl Holmes Richardson was the inventor of the Hotpoint electric iron, head of the General Electric Co. plant in Ontario and founder of the desert community of Adelanto, California, with his brother J. Roy Richardson. Una was the aunt of John Anson Ford, American journalist, advertising executive, Democratic Party politician and long-serving member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Career Winter was joint owner and accountant of citrus properties. She prided herself on having been the first woman in Wisconsin to operate a typewriter when serving as secretary to a lumber concern at Tomah, Wisconsin. She was president of the Southern District, California Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. In 1928 she was the first such executive to fly to a convention, having made the trip by plane from Los Angeles to San Diego. From 1912 to 1914 she was president of the Chicago Altrui Women's Club. She was president and honorary life member of both the Upland Woman's Club and Upland Business and Professional Women's Club. She was a member of the Claremont Pomological Club-Citrus Growers Club. In August 1928 she endorsed the candidacy of former Judge Jesse Olney, from the Upland Business and Professional Women's club; her effort were not met by the Women's Club. On September 28, 1928, one hundred prominent business and professional women of the West End and from Pomona assembled at Hotel Ontario for a Herbert Hoover dinner and rally. Winter was general chairman and acted as presiding officer. In 1935 she visited Mexico as representative of the Business Women's legislative council in the interests of the equal suffrage campaign. She reported being received with courtesy but was unable to discover any interest in women's suffrage there; she also reported the lack of women's organizations in the country. On September 24, 1935, she founded the Equal Rights Study Club, made up of a group of members of the Ontario and Upland Business and Professional Women's clubs. The focus was a special study of proposed equal rights amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Winter was named temporary chairman and the club held its first regular meeting at her home in East Ninth Street, Cucamonga. She was the director of the Susan B. Anthony Memorial Committee of California and collected material about Susan B. Anthony and her family. Her papers are at the Huntington Library, Manuscripts Department, and include material about Mary Ritter Beard, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Alma Lutz, in addition to material about Susan B. Anthony. There are also some letters (1936‚Äì46) from various Congressmen to Una Richardson Winter regarding the Equal Rights Amendment. The bulk of the Susan B. Anthony Papers at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, came by Una R. Winter. The Amy C. Ransome Collection was donated to University of Southern California by Winter; Amy Cordoba Rock Ransome (1872‚Äì1942), suffragist, was a National Woman's Party leader who devoted her life to promote equal rights for women. In 1948 Winter wrote Alice Park of California: worker for woman suffrage and for children's rights. Alice Locke Park was a notable California suffragist and associate director of the Susan B. Anthony Memorial Committee of California. Personal life Winter moved to California in 1914 and lived at 8303 Ninth Street, Cucamonga, California. She married George L. Winter (1884‚Äì1951). She died on January 20, 1956 and is buried beside her husband at Bellevue Memorial Park, Ontario, California.

It is an octagonal tower in white masonry with a red lantern that has a range of 18 nautical miles. History As a result of its position on the estuary of the Tagus River, Cabo da Guia had always been important for navigation. From 1523, this point on the Portuguese coast was illuminated by the chapel of the Hermitage of Our Lady of Guia. In 1537 the brothers of the hermitage raised a tower where a group of four or five oil lights were lit. This light was maintained by the brotherhood, keeping it lit for about eight months of the year. During the 1755 Lisbon earthquake the tower was badly damaged, requiring major reconstruction works and equipment replacement. To illuminate several points of the coastline the Marquis of Pombal ordered six lighthouses to be built, of which the Guia lighthouse was one. Coastal view of the lighthouse The rebuilt Guia lighthouse was completed in 1761. It now emits a fixed white light, with a range of 19 nautical miles in good visibility, over an arc of 240 degrees. Its tower, which is 23 meters high, is made up of thick masonry walls. It was lined with white tiles in the mid-19th century and renovated in April 2003. The Guia lighthouse was electrified in 1957.

Compared to their close didelphine cousins like the living Philander and Didelphis (and like the still living Lutreolina) opossums, Thylophorops displays specialization towards carnivory, and one species, T. lorenzinii, is the largest known opossum of all time, which could imply a macropredatory role.  Taxonomy  Thylophorops is rather consistently recovered as a didelphine opossum, most often compared to and usually falling within the Didelphis, Philander and Lutreolina group.M. C. McKenna and S. K. Bell. 1997. Classification of Mammals Above the Species Level 1-640 Within Thylophorops itself, there are three recognized species: * Thylophorops chapadmalensis: The type species, known from the Pliocene (Chapadmalalan) Chapadmalal Formation and other (up to Uquian) formations in Argentina. It is known from a variety of skeletal remains, rendering it a fairly common species in the area. It is a large opossum species, comparable to the modern Virginia opossum in size. * Thylophorops lorenzinii: Currently known only from the holotype MLP 08-III-10-1, a lower jaw and skull fragment, coming from Late Pliocene deposits in Buenos Aires. It represents a juvenile individual, estimated to weight around , making it the largest known didelphid of all time. * Thylophorops perplana/perplanus: The earliest known species, occurring in Early Pliocene Argentinian deposits.Goin, Francisco J.; Ulyses F. J. Pardinas (1996). \\"Revision de las especies del genero Hyperdidelphys Ameghino, 1904 (Mammalia, Marsupialia, Didelphidae.

Biology  Thylophorops species (as well as several other contemporary opossum genera) show a high degree of speciation towards carnivory compared to most living didelphines. Their premolar and molar teeth were proportionally larger than those of living opossums and their grinding facets imply a more dedicated shearing action; these have been interpreted as \\"omnivory leading towards carnivory\\" and as more specialized carnivory in posterior studies. There is evidence that T. chapadmalensis re-appropriated burrows from other digging mammals, as well as outright consuming them. Thylophorops species as a whole tended to be terrestrial rather than arboreal.  Paleoecology  Thylophorops lived at a time when South America's older predatory guilds were dismantling. It co-existed with only a few sparassodont and phorusrhacid taxa like Thylacosmilus and Llallawavis, and it, as well as similar opossum species, evolved to fill the ecological blanks. A similar case is observed with the carnivorous armadillo Macroeuphractus, a product of this same era of faunal turn-overs. As mentioned above, there is evidence of T. chapadmalensis predating on contemporary caviomorphs and appropriating burrows, from them or other mammals such as armadillos.

The football club played throughout the early 1900s until World War II. After the war, three local deaf football clubs were formed; Ulster Institute for the Deaf (FP), Kinghan Church (KC) and St Joseph's. After these three clubs folded in the late 1960s, management representatives from each former club got together and decided to form Belfast Deaf United. The new club was formed in 1967, to enable deaf football players from Greater Belfast to play weekly football. The club has played in various football leagues across Belfast in the past fifty years including the Belfast Church League, the Down Area League, and the Belfast District Football League. Since 2003/2004, the club has participated in the annual British Deaf Cup tournament. This is a tournament, playing against the top deaf football clubs across the United Kingdom.

It operated for about thirty years between the early 1970s and the early 2000s in a number of locations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Some of its facilities reportedly housed as many as 400 children who were aged between a few months and sixteen years old. Children in the Cadet Org were divided into two or three different categories reflecting their age and level of proficiency in Scientology. They were typically housed in dorms under the supervision of a small number of adults. Conditions at Cadet Org facilities were reportedly often dirty and unsafe, which resulted in at least two prosecutions by public authorities. The children were granted only infrequent contact with their parents and reportedly had very little time off or playtime. The Cadet Org was said to have been severely under-resourced, leading to a lack of basic provisions such as toilet paper, food and clothing at various times and places. The Church of Scientology itself reported that the Cadet Org was often treated as a dumping ground for adult staff who had failed elsewhere in the Sea Org, leading to unsuitable people, including pedophiles, working in Cadet Org facilities. Internal church documents and the accounts of ex-members have highlighted recurrent problems with physical and sexual abuse of children in the Cadet Org. Like the adult Sea Org, the Cadet Org was run on quasi-military lines with a strict daily routine, timed to the minute, that ran from at least 6:30am to 9:30pm. Children were given posts and were assigned responsibility for managing various aspects of their facilities, including discipline. They were required to do hard physical labor, sometimes without protective equipment and at very young ages. The Cadet Org was eventually dissolved around the start of the 21st century after Sea Org members were forbidden to have children, as they were regarded as too great a burden. This reportedly resulted in many female Sea Org members having abortions to avoid being punished by the Church for contravening the ban. Origins and policies The Cadet Org was defined by Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard as being Hubbard's attitude towards children was to treat them as what he termed \\"assets\\". In 1972 he wrote: He told Scientologists in 1973: In Scientology doctrine, children are regarded as being \\"adults in small bodies\\". According to L. Ron Hubbard, their bodies house ancient and immortal thetans or spirits who are capable of carrying out the same responsibilities as any adult. Because their spirits are regarded as ageless, their status as children is irrelevant. Scientologists working as staff members believe that their most important purpose is saving the world and everything else is secondary. Vicki Aznaran, a former church official, explains: \\"Scientology comes first, and everything else is off-purpose. Parents who want to spend time with their children are looked down on. It's not socially acceptable.\\" During the late 1960s, when Hubbard founded the Sea Org to accompany him aboard the ships Apollo, Athena, Diana, and Excalibur, caring for children presented a significant problem for Sea Org members. A post of \\"Governess\\" was established in 1968 to look after Sea Org children. The difficulty of looking after children aboard a ship is hinted at by Hubbard's instruction that if a child was \\"found in Hold 1 or any hidden compartment of the ship they are to be locked up.\\"Hubbard, \\"Governess\\". Flag Order 1630, 3 December 1968 By the early 1970s, Sea Org members were being based ashore and new arrangements were needed. In 1972, the newly-established Cadet Org was divided into three subgroups: Cadets, who were Sea Org members on the payroll with posts of their own; children, aged 6 and above, who were not on the payroll, and babies or small children, who were under 6 years of age. Children and Cadets were permitted to attend public or state schools in their area, but had to undertake Scientology study in the evenings to \\"handle any confusions\\" caused by what they had covered in school. Sea Org parents were allowed to form Parents' Committees to oversea the living conditions and upbringing of Sea Org children. However, parents' contact with their children was restricted; communications \\"to a child or about a child\\" were required to go through the Cadets' Commanding Officer \\"who may alter or cut it if off [program].\\"Crivello, Steve, \\"Re ‚Äì Cadet Org\\". CMO ED 411, 29 August 1979 Children who transgressed were to be punished \\"by placing that child in the [Rehabilitation Project Force] under severe restrictions\\". The RPF is a program for Sea Org members who are regarded as having violated expectations or policies, and has been characterized by critics as a forced labor and re- indoctrination program. A version for children was established by order of L. Ron Hubbard. It appears to have fallen into abeyance for a while, but a 1989 minute by a Cadet Org staff member recommended its reinstitution. The author wrote that she had \\"several Cadets and blown [escaped] Cadets who need to go to the children's RPF ... A very small percentage are enturbulative [troublesome] sources and are sabotaging efforts to set the scene right. They need to be moved off the line per Forcing In The Ideal Scene.\\" One particular child, who was named in the document, was recommended to be \\"moved off everyone's lines and put into the Children's RPF. [He] recently took a razor blade and cut X's in his skin up and down both his arms. He is pychotic [sic] in PT [present time] and needs close supervision.\\" Life in the Cadet Org =California= Los Angeles Sea Org children based in Los Angeles, California, lived in a number of facilities including a building on Fountain Avenue, another on Melrose Avenue and two three-story buildings at 811 Beacon Street. One of them, Tonja Burden, spent three months at Beacon Street in 1973 at the age of 13. She later testified that at the facility, which housed 400 children, By the Church's own admission, the Fountain Avenue facility was illegal, as it flouted local child safety regulations. It violated several building codes ‚Äì it was not the right type of construction for group care of children, children under five were cared for above the first floor, and the children's rooms did not all have exits directly to the outside of the building. The illegalities were discovered by the Los Angeles County and State authorities following a hepatitis outbreak in February 1979. The church was tipped off that it would be raided by California state agents. This gave it time to move the children into an annex building that was hurriedly made to confirm with legal requirements. By the time the raid took place, a church official reported, \\"there was nothing they could do to us.\\"Lamarr, Stephen. \\"Parent Briefing on Annex and PT Scene\\". Cadet GO ED #4, 5 May 1979 One of the nannies, Sheila Huber, said that at the age of sixteen she was put in charge of around thirty children aged under three, all housed in a single one-bedroom apartment: \\"I couldn't believe it. It was wall-to-wall cribs. There were just under 30 children and they were under my sole care. I had no training.\\" Perhaps not surprisingly, the children had very restricted lives, according to Huber. She later recalled: PAC Ranch Some of the children of Scientologists working at the Church's Pacific Area Command (PAC) base in Los Angeles were housed at Canyon Oaks Ranch near Santa Clarita, California, north-west of the city. According to former Scientologists Saina Kamula and Mirriam Francis, who lived at the PAC Ranch in the mid-1990s, it was a \\"military-esque\\" facility that operated \\"like Lord of the Flies\\". Francis described it as \\"a bunch of trailers plopped down on a few acres in desert SoCal area and that's where we studied more Scientology and worked and lived amongst each other.\\" Kamula and Francis say that children were punished by being made to eat lunch behind maggot-infested dumpsters. Similar to other Cadet Org facilities, the children living at the PAC Ranch were made to carry out hard physical labor including demolish possibly asbestos-laced walls or laying bricks on L. Ron Hubbard Way in Los Angeles. Kamula says that she was made to work for 60 hours a week as an underage teen and suffered severe stress as a result, which led to her being placed on a suicide watch on several occasions. The facility was shut down in 2007. Int Ranch In the 1990s, the children of Sea Org members working at Scientology's Gold Base in California were housed in a facility called the \\"Int[ernational] Ranch\\". This was located on five hundred acres of land in the San Jacinto Hills in Riverside County, adjacent to the Soboba Indian Reservation about 20 miles from Gold Base. A cluster of buildings called the Motels occupied the center of the site, with six or seven other buildings scattered around nearby.Miscavige Hill, p. 34 When Jenna Miscavige Hill was sent there at the age of six in March 1990, she was one of fifteen other children of senior Scientology executives who lived at the site ‚Äì a figure that eventually grew to around 80.Ibid., pp. 1, 41 The site was dilapidated, overgrown and presented fire risks, so the children were put to work renovating it. Although electrical and plumbing work was carried out by adults, virtually all of the other renovation work was carried out by the children.Ibid., p. 41 The children were divided into three groups: Children, Precadets and Cadets. The grouping was determined by both age and how advanced they were in their Scientology training. The youngest, the Children, were generally under six years old, Precadets were seven to nine and Cadets nine to sixteen. It was possible for particularly advanced younger children to be Cadets, or for older children who were behind with their studies to still be Precadets. It was also possible for children to be demoted to a lower group as a punishment.Ibid., p. 48 Later in 1990 an increasingly regimented regime was put in place in which the children's activities were scheduled down to the minute. It became more like a military boot camp in which children were made to do what Miscavige Hill describes as \\"gruelling drills, endless musters, exhaustive inspections, and arduous physical labor that no child should have to do.\\"Ibid., p. 49 A rigorous system of punishments and internal surveillance was implemented to keep the children in line. Any infractions resulted in being issued a chit, a kind of written demerit, which was kept on record. The children were instructed to report on each other's activities and speak up if they saw any infractions, otherwise they would be considered an accessory to the offense and would receive the same punishment as the offender. This, Miscavige Hill says, \\"made it difficult for anyone to trust anyone else\\".Ibid., pp. 49‚Äì50 Life for a Cadet or Precadet followed a set, and lengthy, daily routine, overseen by the children themselves in accordance with L. Ron Hubbard's instructions. They wore uniforms consisting of khaki shorts with a red t-shirt or polo shirt with the Sea Org emblem embroidered on it. They also had sweat pants, dress pants and a vest but were not permitted to wear any of their own clothes, with the exception of pajamas. They were roused at 6:30am and given half an hour to carry out cleaning assignments. At 7am they were formed up into seven different Divisions, each under a Division Head, for a morning muster in front of the Commanding Officer Cadet ‚Äì a fellow Cadet. The children stood to attention with the Division Heads saluting while the Master-at-Arms, another child, read out a military-style report on each Division's status. Uniforms were inspected and the personal hygiene of each child was checked, with their breath and armpits smell-tested and their hair inspected for lice.Ibid., pp. 52‚Äì53 Punishments were imposed for lateness or failing inspections. Lateness was particularly harshly punished, ranging from being issued with a chit to having a bucket of ice water poured over the offender's head. Failing a berthing inspection would result at the very least in receiving a chit. An offender might alternatively be ordered to white-glove the room (cleaning it so well that a person wearing white gloves could run their hands over the surfaces without getting them dirty) or in extremis being ordered to sleep overnight in Pig's Berthing, an old mattress in a rat- and bat-infested derelict building on the site. Zoe Woodcraft, who was there at the same time as Miscavige Hill, wrote that she recalled \\"two girls about nine years old who were forced to spend the night there and in the middle of the night they ran screaming and crying from the building. One of the girls afterward told me that they had been terrified by the bats and couldn't stand it anymore.\\" After the morning muster, a period of Scientology training was followed by work on the children's assigned posts. Miscavige Hill was made a groundsman at the age of six, responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of part of the grounds, which involved physical labor. A few months later, when she was seven, she was made the Medical Liaison Officer ‚Äì in effect the site doctor ‚Äì with responsibility for identifying and treating any medical conditions reported by the children. She was also responsible for doling out vitamins and formulas as specified by Hubbard, which every child was required to ingest daily.Ibid., pp. 54‚Äì55 No matter how sick a child was, no drugs were allowed other than antibiotics, but visits from real doctors were rare. In the entire time that Miscavige Hill was at the Int Ranch, she did not go to a doctor once despite several periods of sickness.Ibid., pp. 56‚Äì57 Breakfast took place between 8:30 and 9am. A \\"table captain\\" was assigned for each table to supervise the delivery of food. This followed by fifteen minutes for the children to clean the dishes and dining room, and then a second muster. Between 9:15am and 12:45pm, Monday through Friday, and all day Saturday, the children went to decks or labor-intensive projects. Deck time formally lasted 25 hours per week but work more realistically lasted for at least 35 hours per week for all the Precadets and Cadets, from ages six upwards. They were divided into labor units which were assigned to specific projects, many involving hard physical labor. There was some lighter work such as doing the laundry or cleaning the swimming pool, but the children were also responsible for rock hauling, weeding, planting trees, digging irrigation trenches, landscaping the site and renovating buildings. On Saturdays the children had to carry out intensive cleaning of their berthings and the buildings. The adults at the Int Ranch issued project orders and inspected the results to make sure they were satisfactory, but only rarely intervened to help out the children. The work took place in all weathers, ranging from rain and hail to temperatures upwards of 100 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C), with only occasional five-minute breaks permitted. There was no protective equipment and the children often had to wear inappropriate clothing, such as shorts in the winter, as there was no funding for new clothes.Ibid., pp. 58‚Äì60 Scientology put forward a number of justifications for making the children do such work. They were told that the labor was an exchange for being able to live on the Ranch, earning their way rather than getting things for free, which was something that only criminals sought. The hard labor was said to be a way to train the children to take pride in their work, face tough situations and handle MEST (the physical world), which would make them better Scientologists. If their work or conduct was repeatedly deemed unsatisfactory they would be sent to the HMU, the Heavy MEST Work Unit, where they would be required to do the hardest forms of physical labor such as deep trench digging. Offenders were also physically isolated from the rest of the children.Ibid., pp. 60‚Äì61 Miscavige Hill notes that \\"we were a group of children who devoted hours of every day to doing the kind of physical labor that no child should have to do.\\" The work was physically taxing: Deck time ended at 12:45pm and was followed by clean-up and lunch. An hour later at 1:45pm, schooling began in a range of typical academic topics, which the children taught themselves using textbooks and checksheets.Ibid., p. 65 There was no teacher but the children were instead overseen by a course supervisor who tested them on an E-meter to see if they had misunderstood anything. This continued until 6pm, with a fifteen-minute break and a snack. Dinner and another clean-up took place from 6 to 6:45pm, followed by Scientology training until 9pm.Ibid., p. 68 Finally, the children were required to fill out Student Point Slips, a kind of progress report for the day, in which various activities were assigned point scores for completion. This was used for the \\"management by statistics\\" system implemented by Hubbard across Scientology: the points were tabulated and marked on a graph, which had to show an up-trend each day. Each day ended with an adulation period for L. Ron Hubbard, whose portrait was displayed on the wall of the course room. The children would face his picture, chant \\"Hip! Hip! Hooray\\", and applaud the portrait for a couple of minutes. After a short period to get ready for bed, lights-out came at 9:30pm sharp, ending a thirteen-hour day.Ibid., pp. 71‚Äì72 The children had no free or play time, but there were three breaks to the routine during the week. On Thursday afternoons, the children were required to spend two hours tallying up their daily statistics to determine their status in accordance with the concept of Scientology ethics. Depending on the outcome of the graphing, the children would have to take particular steps to improve or maintain their statistics. If the trend was down, potentially negative consequences would follow, such as having privileges revoked or being given only rice and beans to eat. The children were also given weekly E-meter checks to determine whether they were concealing secrets or transgressions, and had to write weekly reports to their parents. On Friday evenings a graduation ceremony was held for course completions and Scientology media presentations were shown, followed by the disbursement of a five-dollar weekly allowance.Ibid., pp. 73‚Äì77 Contact with parents was extremely limited. Jenna Miscavige Hill's father visited once a week for twenty minutes during his lunch break, and was unusual for being one of only a few parents to do so.Ibid., pp. 45‚Äì46 At 10pm on Saturday nights, she was allowed to go to her parents' apartment to stay with them overnight.Ibid., p. 78 She was also given two or three days off over Christmas.Ibid., p. 97 Letters to and from parents were monitored to ensure that nothing negative was said. Any complaints would be treated as \\"nattering\\" and punished.Ibid., p. 76 Weekly phone calls were also permitted.Ibid., p. 79 The children were occasionally let out to attend special events, when Miscavige Hill says they were \\"dressed up in cute outfits in front of our parents and Int crew to make it seem as though Scientology were creating a normal and joyful childhood, when in fact we were all being robbed of it.\\"Ibid., p. 80 Zoe Woodcraft, by contrast, spent over a year there but, she says, \\"we never went into town for a field trip; never went to a movie, shopping or anything. We were totally isolated. The only time I ever left was when I was allowed once to take a leave of absence to visit my father at Christmas.\\" In the absence of parental support, Miscavige Hill writes, Apollo Training Academy Some children were sent to the Apollo Training Academy (ATA), located on Fountain Street opposite the offices of Scientology publishing house Bridge Publications. Mike Rinder, a former high-ranking Scientology official, describes it as \\"a cinder block building, with a double- wide trailer in the front, six-foot fence around it with a top on it so outside people couldn't see\\". It was originally run by a Scientology entity called the Cadets Estate Organization, which was later separated from the Cadet Org. Woodcraft was sent there after returning from a stay in New York in 1992, when she was nine years old, as there was no more room for children at the ranch. She later wrote that the conditions there were the worst that she ever encountered as a child: The ATA operated as a Scientology school for about two hundred children. They studied a mixed Scientology and mainstream curriculum comprising L. Ron Hubbard's works plus math, reading and spelling. Unlike the ranch, there was no strict regimentation and the children were able to go to the beach or the park on Mondays. According to Woodcraft, they \\"would often go to a park and spend the whole day there, also. They would also take us to a fifty-cent swimming pool, however a lot of the kids did not have the money to swim so we just sat around all day. If we asked the teacher for money, she said no and told us it was too bad for us we had no money.\\" Although the location did not allow for the kind of hard outdoor labor performed at the ranch, the children were nonetheless put to work cleaning the building. Woodcraft recalled being assigned to an activity they called \\"chicken picking\\" the carpet. She wrote: There were also problems with the staff at the ATA. Saina Kamula, a former member of the Sea Org, has said that an older member of staff at the ATA repeatedly sexually abused her during her stay there in the 1990s. When she reported the abuse to a teacher, she says, she was punished for being \\"counter-intention\\" ‚Äì acting against the interests of Scientology. The abuser was never punished and remained an \\"active and respected member of the Church\\" as of August 2017. =Florida= During the 1990s a Cadet Org facility operated near Scientology's \\"Mecca\\", the city of Clearwater, Florida. It was situated in a former Quality Inn, which the Scientologists called the QI, at 16432 U.S. Highway 19 in Largo, Florida. Woodcraft's entire family of five was initially housed there in 1986 in a single room which was \\"very small, approximately 12' by 20'. It was one room and one bath; very shabby, infested with cockroaches and smelling of mold. All five of us were in this room so it was very cramped and nearly unlivable.\\" She returned to the QI for a while in 1993 and then for a longer stay from 1994 to 2000, living in a Cadet Org dorm in the building. When 12-year-old Scientology cadet Kristi Erlich flew from Los Angeles to visit her 13-year-old sister Beth at the QI, her first reaction to the sight of her room was one of horror: \\"Oh my god, I couldn't even believe that Beth lived in a place like that. There were bugs everywhere.... We were always scared of having bugs run across our feet and face and stuff while we were sleeping.\\" After escaping from Scientology at the end of 2000, Woodcraft wrote a detailed account of life at the QI. She described it as \\"overall depressing and dreary\\", and the Cadets and Precadets were kept \\"always on a boring and strict schedule.\\" The Precadets were never allowed to leave the premises, rarely went on outings and could only play in the parking lot. Woodcraft worked every afternoon and all day on Sundays, which was designated as \\"renos\\" (renovations) day where the children worked to repair and refurbish the building. Saturday afternoons could also be designated as \\"renos\\", after parental visits earlier in the day. On one \\"reno\\" assignment, she was told to demolish the walls of a room in the QI: On Saturday nights the children could watch a movie, selected by the building's governess. Woodcraft recalled that for a while, the governess \\"was in love with a move called \\"White Knight\\" and we had to watch that movie over and over again for weeks. This was not a children's movie and it was unbelievably boring.\\" Strict censorship was applied to the children's listening and reading materials. Woodcraft wrote: Woodcraft rose through the ranks and took on various jobs, \\"one of which was to make sure all the pictures of Ron Hubbard looked nice, so I was always cleaning cockroach feces out of the frames and the cardboard backing.\\" In another post, as the Hubbard Communications Office Area Secretary (HAS) and Director of Inspections and Reports, she managed disciplinary affairs: \\"I had to read the \\"overt write ups\\" of the other cadets. This would include the reports written up about masturbation and other sexual activity between the cadets. I also participated in courts of ethics and committees of evidence for children. These are disciplinary actions per church policies.\\" When she was eleven, she was promoted to the rank of Cadet. This enabled her to move to better accommodation within the building and she was given more freedom of movement. If their statistics were on a rising trend they were allowed to go bowling (always in pairs; they were never allowed to go by themselves) and if they were awarded \\"Cadet of the Week\\" status they were given ice cream. She moved on to the Cadet Technical Training Corps at age twelve or thirteen, studying the works of L. Ron Hubbard for eleven hours a day from Mondays to Saturdays. Conventional schooling was limited to ten hours on Sunday. There was little free time and no days off other than the Scientology \\"holiday\\" of Sea Org Day, plus Christmas Day. On one occasion she was allowed to go on a two-week trip. She left the Cadet Org when she was fourteen to join the Sea Org proper, and fled Scientology two years later. The QI facility came to the attention of the Pinellas County police, who visited it. According to the county Sheriff, Greg Tita, the police \\"determined that there were signs of child neglect and abuse. They wrote up a report and the case was forwarded to the juvenile office. However, Scientology lodged a complaint against the publication of the report in the press and won. It is still sealed today. I don't think that it has to do with a dispute over the investigation, they just wanted to make sure no information got to the public.\\" According to Tita, runaway cadets were sent by the church to \\"the children's prison camp\\", the Rehabilitation Project Force.Botros, Mona & Koch, Egmont R. \\"Gesucht wird...\\". ARD, Germany. Broadcast on April 2, 1997 =England= A Cadet Org facility existed at Stonelands, a mansion located in the southern English county of West Sussex near the village of West Hoathly. It housed the children of Sea Org members working at Scientology's UK headquarters a few miles away at Saint Hill Manor in East Sussex. Claire Headley was four years old when she was placed there as one of about forty Scientologist children, with a single adult female Scientologist looking after all of them. Her mother, a single parent, worked at Saint Hill Manor but was allowed very little time to interact with her daughter: an hour a day at dinnertime and three hours on Saturdays. Children were allowed to join the church's permanent staff at the age of eight, but there was no provision for schooling at the facility. Headley later recalled: Headley says that, like cadets in a number of other Cadet Org facilities, she experienced various forms of abuse: \\"My experiences were by no means extreme. Physical and verbal abuse, sexual abuse, molestation and extreme neglect were very common experiences for cadets. I‚Äôve often found it difficult to share my experiences, because I resent the idea of being considered a science project. At age 7, an older male staff member tried to lure my friend and I to his office to molest us. I refused to go with him and urged my friend not to go with him. My friend chose to go and he molested her. This was never reported to the police.\\" Another former Cadet Org member, Melissa Paris, says that the Sea Org governesses regularly hit the children, who also ganged up on each other. On one occasion, she writes, she was thrown down the stairs by one governess, which led to a rare intervention from her father. Paris lived at Stonelands between the ages of four and twelve. She recalled that her day started around 7am, when \\"we'd muster ‚Äì we'd all stand in a line, according to divisions. Then we had to breakfast on time, because if you missed it, you didn't eat. Then some would go to Saint Hill and do their jobs. Others would stay at Stonelands and had to clean the house. There wasn't much free time, maybe an hour or two. When I was younger there had been something called Family Time, an hour or two in the evening when you saw your parents\\". Family Time was abolished when she was about six or seven, meaning that she no longer saw her father during the day. According to Paris, the mansion was in a run- down state and she experienced grim conditions. Her sister Valeska, who was also at Stonelands, says that \\"we had no toilet paper 90 percent of the time in the Cadet Org. We either had to use pages from books in the library to wipe ourselves or our hands and wipe it on the wall. I know it's gross but it's true. The toilet had shit all over the wall.\\" Not surprisingly, personal hygiene suffered: \\"We were Stonelands kids. Dirty. We had lice.\\" Conditions at Stonelands were still poor a decade later. In 1993, Mid-Sussex District Council prosecuted the Church of Scientology for breaches of fire safety regulations after another Scientology property in the area burned down. Although the Church had declared that 50 people were living there, an internal Scientology document inspection listed more than 190 residents. At least 24 children were living in dormitories of which a Scientology official noted, \\"Smell[s] of wet beds and bleach ... smell of wet beds needs to be handled.\\" =Mexico= In 1982, former Scientologist Scott Mayer testified in a public hearing in Clearwater, Florida that he had been responsible for maintaining a Cadet Org facility in Mexico for the children of Los Angeles-based Scientologists. They were kept there rather than in the United States as it was said to be cheaper. According to Mayer, \\"Children were routinely transported from Los Angeles to the Mexican base and berthed and housed there...so that their mothers and fathers could get on with their business within the Church.\\" However, the Mexican base was unsafe: it was raided at night by thieves who would come in and steal items from the property. Mayer was ordered to procure a rifle with an infrared sniper scope to deal with the thieves. However, it was not needed as the woman who ran the base shot one of the bandits and deterred them from returning. The physical conditions at the base were also extremely hazardous. The property was thickly covered with brush, which grew right up to the ranch house, and there were poisonous scorpions, snakes and spiders in the area. No money or personnel were initially available to deal with these problems. Mayer eventually resolved the situation by taking a jar of scorpions to his superior and telling him that a child's death would cause bad public relations for Scientology. =Australia= Sea Org members living in Australia sent children to a Cadet Org facility located in a Sydney townhouse in the 1990s. Scarlett Hanna, who lived there for several years, described it as \\"an incredibly lonely childhood. I had no-one to talk to or to look after to me or to ask me how I was after school or, you know, any of those things that most of us take for granted.\\" She said that she and the other children did not receive adequate food or medical care. According to Hanna, the Sea Org successfully managed to conceal the children's living conditions from the city's Community Services department when the facility was inspected on two occasions. She said that the furniture was dismantled and the children were sent out for the day to make it appear that the facility was not overcrowded. Decline and fall of the Cadet Org The management of its child members was a long-running source of difficulties for the Church of Scientology. In 1974, only a year after Hubbard announced the creation of the Cadet Org, it was sued for running an illegal child care facility and was put on probation. Five years later, it had a narrow escape when the Los Angeles County authorities discovered that the church was running another illegal child care facility in the Cadet Org's building on Fountain Avenue, Los Angeles. The church was able to escape indictment after being tipped off that a raid was imminent and moved the children into another, legally compliant, building. Serious problems nonetheless persisted in Los Angeles. An \\"Aides Order\\" published internally by the Sea Org in August 1981 reported that in the Los Angeles-based Pacific Area Command alone, there were 339 children aged between newborn and 18 in the PAC Sea Org organizations. (In 1974 there had only been 20 parents in the entire PAC Sea Org.) The way they were being managed was causing numerous problems. The minute noted that they were behind their grade level in the public school system and there were numerous reports of unethical and criminal misbehavior by Sea Org children, including theft and sexual misconduct. It stated: \\"Due to the recent filthy conditions of the [Cadet Estates Organization] and the criminal behavior of the children the area has become a PR and Legal threat to the Church ... the scene is wildly off the rails and the scene has become very degraded. PAC SO children instead of becoming valuable personnel assets are in many cases becoming criminals.\\"Price, Larry. \\"PAC Cadet Org/Cadet Estates Org Establishment Eval\\". Aides Order 203‚Äì71. 28 August 1981 A series of \\"missions\\" by Scientology management through the 1970s attempted to resolve these problems but failed, which the 1981 Aides Order attributed to a failure to follow L. Ron Hubbard's dictates. For instance, parents and the children's adult supervisors caused problems \\"by treating them as \\"kids\\" rather than SO members. This was often covert such as parents insisting that their cadet go on libs [spend time] with them even though the cadet's stats were down and he hadn't earned a libs, resulting in degrade of the cadet's post\\". The order advised that parents should be \\"re-educated\\" to regard their children as \\"resources and real SO members.\\" It commented that \\"since the destructive cultural pattern of handling children is deeply ingrained in the US this would need to be stripped off as false data\\" and concluded that the parents \\"do not view children as a [Present Time] resource worth investing a lot of time or effort in.\\" Further problems were caused by the quality of the adult personnel assigned to look after the cadets. The Aides Order reported that the Commanding Officer of the Cadet Org \\"was criminal and sadistic to other Cadets. He was removed mid 77 after he handcuffed another Cadet to an electrical outlet and nearly electrocuted him.\\" A subsequent investigation found that the Cadet Estates Organization \\"also had a large number of DBs [Degraded Beings], criminals and perverts posted in it. Some of these would slap the cadets around and treat them like \\"kids\\".\\" This was due at least in part to the fact that the Sea Org had \\"continually put their unwanted or reject staff\\" into looking after children. To resolve these problems, the Aides Order proposed a series of reforms which would improve the management of the Cadet Org and make the Cadet Estates Org, which looked after their facilities, an entirely separate body exclusively managed by adults. Sea Org members with a history of sexual misconduct were to be removed from Cadet Org and Cadet Estates Org staff. However, the problems with pedophilia and poor living conditions evidently persisted, as a December 1989 minute from the Commanding Officer of the Cadet Estates Organization (CO CEO) to the Commanding Officer of the Commodore's Messenger Organization Pacific Area Command (CO CMO PAC) made clear: \\"The school is a disgrace, with could [sic] food fed to the children as there is no way to keep it hot, 90% of all children under grade level, etc.\\" A Sea Org member who was a qualified teacher was removed from his post due to his admission that he was feeling sexual urges towards the children. The teacher's confession was quoted in the minute: In the end, the Cadet Org was shut down entirely. The first step was taken in 1979 when Sea Org members in Los Angeles were forbidden to have children, and people with children were mostly forbidden to join the Sea Org. An Executive Directive was issued which stated: As a Church website puts it, \\"by 1986 it had become apparent that the duties of a member of the Sea Organization were not compatible with raising children.\\" A new Sea Org-wide directive was issued in September 1986 which prohibited Sea Org members from having children as the Sea Org did not have the time, money or resources to look after them. Having children was deemed to undermine the purpose and production of Sea Org members. If they disobeyed the Flag Order they would be sent to a distantly located Scientology organization of the Class V level (a medium-level Scientology organization). They could return to the Sea Org once the unauthorized child was six years old. However, Sea Org members continued having children so the new policy was reissued and strengthened in another Flag Order of April 3, 1991. The penalty for having a child was increased; violators would now be sent to \\"a small non-expanding Class IV org\\".Lesevre, Guillaume. \\"Children, Sea Org Members and Sea Org Orgs Addition\\". Flag Order 3501-1, 3 April 1991 Mary Tabayoyon, who was a Sea Org member for 21 years, wrote that this was regarded as a severe punishment: \\"In a failing Class IV Org an exiled Sea Org member would have to fend for himself or herself and try and raise a child on the nominal compensation provided to the staff of a failing Class IV Org. In addition, the exiled Sea Org members would be obligated to revive the failing Org or suffer more Ethics [disciplinary] conditions.\\" In addition, any Sea Org colleagues who knew about an unauthorized child or pregnancy but did not take action against the parents would be punished. The result of the new rules was that many female Sea Org members who were desperate to remain in the Sea Org after getting pregnant had abortions instead, allegedly under the pressure of threatened disciplinary action.Affidavit of Mary Tabayoyon. 26 August 1994 As a result of the new rules, the Cadet Org was no longer required and was dissolved in the early 2000s.

They are sometimes grouped with the Bardi people and referred to as \\"Bardi Jawi\\", as the languages and culture are similar. Language The Jawi dialect belongs to the western branch of the non-Pama- Nyungan, Nyulnyulan family. It is close to Bardi. Social and economic organisation The Jawi have historically been seafaring traders. The Unggarrangu furnished them with mandjilal wood for their catamarans, and the Jawi in turn supplied the Bardi with this buoyant mangrove timber for the Bardi people's log rafts. They in turn bartered shells in return for wooden spears from the inland Warwa and Njikena tribes. Jawi and Bardi people have historically shared the same kinship system, social organisation and Law. This closeness led them to form one single group for their native title claim. Country Aboriginal tribes around Derby, WA Jawi traditional lands encompass Sunday Island (Ewenu) (= Iwany) in the King Sound and the wider archipelago. Norman Tindale estimated that the traditional lands of the Jawi (Iwany-oon, meaning \\"Sunday Islanders\\") encompassed about of territory: including Sunday Island and Tohau-i (probably = Jawi), and extending to West Roe Island in the north and to Jackson Island (also called Jayirri or Tyra Island) in the west. However, there are problems with Tindale's estimates about territories in this region. Historical maps are vague about the ownership of islands in this area. In 1972 the Jawi and Bardi community of One Arm Point was established on the Bardi mainland. In 2005 and 2015 the Jawi and Bardi people obtained partial recognition of their collective native title claim. History of contact Jawi people began to have sustained contact with non-Indigenous people in the 1880s, as pearlers came to the region's abundant pearling grounds. Sydney Hadley, a one-time pearler and reformed alcoholic who had spent long stints in gaol, set up a nondenominational Protestant mission on Iwanyi (Sunday Island) in 1899. Towards the end of WW2, H. H. J. Coate, who was engaged in a study of Bardi, took over the running of the mission. The mission closed in 1962. Many Jawi people died during an influenza epidemic on Sunday Island in the early twentieth century: by some counts, more than two thirds of the Jawi population.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Constantine was first settled in 1828; by 1830 there was a mill and five families at the location, and the village itself was platted in 1831. The area was easily accessible from the Chicago Road, and following the removal of the government land office from White Pigeon, Constantine emerged as the principal settlement in the area. By 1840, over 800 people lived in the village. Industrial buildings were constructed along the river to take advantage of the water power and the easy access to transportation. Commercial enterprises first appeared along Water Street, but as the village grew, merchants began locating along Washington Street. (note: large pdf file) The first commercial buildings in the village were wooden Greek Revival structures. Although many of these were destroyed by fire over the years, five still survive within the district. These include one building at 145 S. Washington which still exhibits its original 1850s storefront facade, as well as the Barry warehouse at 125 W. Water, which was owned by the prominent merchant and three-time governor John S. Barry. Constantine did not become a railroad stop until the 1870s, and it slipped behind other settlements in shipping and transportation. However, with the onset of the 1870s, a number of substantial and ornate Italianate commercial buildings were constructed in the district. As the 20th century arrived, development shifted to outside the district, so that all but one of the buildings located within this district were constructed before 1916. By the 1950s, more outlying commercial districts began pulling customers away from the downtown. In the 1970s, redevelopment began in the downtown. Description The Constantine Historic Commercial District contains 34 commercial and residential structures within a 5-acre area. Most of the structures are mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century Greek Revival and Italianate buildings. The district is particularly notable for the integrity of its historic storefronts: unlike similar commercial districts, 3/4 of the buildings in this district retain the original street level design elements. Significant buildings within the district include: *Simons Block (120-138 S. Washington): Constructed in 1875, probably for general store operator John W. Simons, this building is the only three story structure in the district. It has several distinguishing architectural features, including a large metal cornice with a pediment above bearing the name and date of construction, and arched window openings with radiating brick around a central keystone. The street level retains the original design of alternating entrances, pilasters, and display windows. *140 S. Washington: This building was constructed in 1870 for clothier Michael A. Melcher. It retains its original design features, and is a unique combination of Gothic and Italianate styles, with Gothic arched windows, with Italianate brickwork. *150 S. Washington: Constructed in 1877, this Italianate building was first a clothing store, but has served as a general and hardware store since 1904. *Art Gallery Building (156 S. Washington): The Art Gallery Building, independently listed on the Register, was constructed in 1877 for George I. Crossett to house his Crossett Drug Store on the first floor, along with a photographic studio on the second floor. It has a unique cast iron facade on the upper floor. *Wells and Calam Block (117 S. Washington): This building was built in 1870 for the general store of the firm of Wells and Calam. It is a richly detailed Italianate building. *145 S. Washington: This is an 1850s Greek Revival commercial building constructed for harness maker Clinton Doolittle. Although covered with siding, the storefront still retains the original street level design of two raised rectangular windows framing a recessed door flanked by sidelights. *The Barry Warehouse (125 W. Water): Although the old Barry Warehouse no longer exhibits much architectural integrity, it is historically significant for the association with John S. Barry, three time Michigan governor. *122. E. Water: This brick-veneered Italianate building was constructed in 1885. The building is notable for the decorative tile and terra cotta frieze, and for the stained glass in the transoms.

Fighting in several conflicts for the group, he eventually died in combat against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant during the Battle of Raqqa.  Biography  Ozanyan's birth name was Fermun √áƒ±rak. He later adopted a great number of pseudonyms, of which \\"Nubar Ozanyan\\" and \\"Orhan Bakƒ±rcƒ±yan\\" were the best known. He was born into a poor ethnic Armenian family in Yozgat, Turkey in 1956, with his mother dying when he was still young. After receiving primary education, he was introduced to radical leftist ideology and joined the TKP/ML. Following the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat, Ozanyan went into exile in France, where he reportedly was one of Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney's defenders. In the late 1980s, Ozanyan joined TKP/ML's military wing, Tƒ∞KKO. In 1988 he ventured to Palestine and fought with the PFLP against Israel during the First Intifada. Ozanyan also received military training by local militants in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley in 1990. Between 1991‚Äì92, he reportedly fought in the Nagorno-Karabakh War against Azerbaijan. He returned to Turkey's Tunceli Province in 1992 and thereafter participated in the local Maoist insurgency. At this time, Ozanyan began to rise in the ranks of the TKP/ML, and became an important organizer, ideologist, recruiter, trainer and frontline commander for the party. In 2013, he trained fighters of Tƒ∞KKO in Iraqi Kurdistan. In July 2015, he became one of the commanders of the newly founded International Freedom Battalion (IFB) in Syria, whose aim was to aid the YPG/YPJ against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As member of the IFB, he reportedly trained \\"many Kurdish, Turkish, Armenian, Arab, Palestinian, Greek, Canadian, Sardinian, Belgian and French internationalist fighters.\\" Meanwhile, he attempted to keep the TKP/ML intact and active in Turkey, where the party faced increasing problems as the Turkish Armed Forces intensified their counter-insurgency campaign after the start of the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict's third phase. Because of that, Ozanyan returned to Tunceli Province for some time in late 2016 or early 2017, but eventually resumed his participation in the IFB. By 2017, he was the leading Tƒ∞KKO commander for operations in Syria. Ozanyan took part in the battle for Raqqa, ISIL's self-proclaimed capital, during which he was killed in combat on 14 August 2017. He was 61 when he died. A memorial was held for him by the IFB and YPG/YPJ in Raqqa, and he was buried with full military honors in al- Malikiyah (Der√Æk) on 28 August. Thousands attended his funeral. His death was lamented by the TKP/ML, the Istanbul-based Armenian Nor Zartonk movement, the IRPGF, the THKP-C/MLSPB, the MLPD, and the PFLP.  Personal life  Ozanyan could read, write and speak Turkish, Armenian and Russian and translated several leftist treatises.  Legacy  On 24 April 2019, a group of Syrian Armenians who were affiliated with TKP/ML and the SDF announced the formation of the Martyr Nubar Ozanyan Brigade.

In August 2020, William Evanina, the U.S. counterintelligence chief, identified Derkach as a key participant in Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney, Democrats‚Äô noisy strategy to stop Russian election interference, Politico, August 8, 2020  Early life and education  Derkach is the son of Leonid Derkach, former director of the Security Service of Ukraine, who was fired in 2001 for his alleged involvement in the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze. (Translation of relevant paragraphs at Talk.) In 2005, the report of an ad hoc committee formed via the Ukrainian parliament, primarily responsible for investigating the murder, concluded that Gongadze's murder had been organized; the primary conspirators remained identified as then-President Kuchma and his Minister of the Interior, in addition to Leonid Derkach, who, according to the committee, had been involved in the crime. Derkach attended the Kharkiv Higher Military Command and Engineering College of Missile Forces, now the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University, graduating in 1989. In 1989 and 1990, he served in the Strategic Missile Force at the technical missile base of the Pervomaysk division; this division remained placed under the command of the Strategic Missile Force. In 1993, he graduated with a Ph.D. in Law from the Dzerzhinsky Higher School, renamed the Academy of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation in 1995; his thesis primarily concerned the \\"Organization and conduct of meetings with secret agents\\".  Career  He worked as Security Officer at the Office of Security Service of Ukraine in the Dnipropetrovsk region. He worked within the following capacities as a member of the Ukrainian government: 1994‚Äì1996: Deputy Director of the Control Service of the President of Ukraine. 1996‚Äì1997: Advisor to the President of Ukraine on Foreign Economic Affairs. 1997‚Äì1998: First Assistant to the Prime Minister of Ukraine. 2006‚Äì2007: President of the National Nuclear Energy Generating Company ‚ÄúEnergoatom\\" 2007: Director General of the State Concern \\"Ukratomprom\\" 2011‚Äì2013: Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ukraine, pro bono. Derkach has been accused of having been involved in ordering the bloody assault by security forces on peaceful demonstrators in Kyiv on December 11, 2013. Business holdings and interests Germany's Federal Agency for Civic Education reported in 2007 that Derkach and his father Leonid led the Derkach group, one of the regional cross-industry holding companies formed in Ukraine after the end of the Soviet Union which had close ties to the political elite and tried to influence politics through lobbying, corrupt networks, and illegal appropriations. Derkach headed a media company comprising four newspapers, a TV guide, and the website –≤–µ—Ä—Å—ñ—ó.com. According to Media Ownership Monitor Ukraine, Derkach \\"de facto owns\\" television channel TRK Era and Radio Era; officially the owner is his assistant Anton Oleksandrovych Simonenko while Derkach is listed as honorary president of Era-Media and head of the arts council of TRK –ïra. Ownership data of the privately held company is not publicly available. Radio Era was one of several radio stations, most prominently among them Petro Poroshenko's Channel 5, that provided around-the- clock reporting from Maidan Square during the Orange Revolution in 2004. Pg. 62 According to anti-corruption watchdog organization Chesno, Derkach and his associates appropriated protected lands valued at millions of dollars; he also failed to declare his wife's stake in various of his business enterprises, as he was obliged to do under the Ukrainian law to prevent corruption. He often lobbies for Oleg Deripaska's Russia company Rusal (formerly Russkiy alyuminiy) and is close to Anatoly Chubais and Chubais's electricity monopoly firm RAO UES.

According to Ukrainian anti- corruption watchdog organization Chesno, Derkach voted for the \\"dictatorship laws\\", ten laws restricting freedom of speech and assembly, which were signed into law by president Viktor Yanukovych in January 2014; nine of them were repealed by the Ukrainian parliament 12 days later. On November 13, 2015, The Interfactional Parliamentary Association ‚ÄúFor the Protection of Violated Rights of Citizens and Against Political Repression ‚ÄúForbidden to Forbid‚Äù was established. Derkach was elected as the Chairman of the Association. On January 26, 2016, Derkach initiated the creation of an interim commission of inquiry on violations of the constitutional rights of citizens. As of October 2019, Derkach represents District 159 in the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine. Interference in United States 2020 elections On October 9, 2019, Derkach alleged that Joe Biden had been involved in an international money laundering scheme with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings and US-based Rosemont Seneca Partners. He claimed that Burisma's payments to four of its board members‚Äìincluding Biden's son Hunter‚Äìwhich were neither secret nor illegal, were \\"a sinister plot involving\\" Ukraine's former president Poroshenko but his claims initially were mostly ignored in Ukraine and abroad. Anders √Öslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, called Derkach \\"not credible\\" and a \\"professional disinformer.\\" On December 5, 2019, Derkach met with President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in Kyiv to put together a corruption case against Biden's son Hunter, according to Derkach. In May 2020, he released a portion of a phone call between Joe Biden and Petro Poroshenko, the former president of the Ukraine.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ukrainian-lawmaker- releases-leaked-phone-calls-of-biden-and- poroshenko/2020/05/19/cc1e6030-9a26-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html On September 10, 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Derkach \\"for attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process,\\" while also alleging that Derkach \\"has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services.\\" The sanctions include freezing all of Derkach's property interests subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with him and with entities of which Derkach owns 50 percent or more.

In the second, enemies follow preset patterns on screen, while in the last, there is a wider array of enemies and the player only gets a small number of lives.  Reception  The game received positive reception from critics, with an aggregate score of 83/100 on Metacritic.

The events at the Civic Square helped set off massive pro-democracy protests, sometimes referred to as the Umbrella Movement, which lasted until police cleared the last of the protest sites in December 2014. The three had originally been convicted and ordered to perform community service or, in the case of Chow, given a suspended sentence. The government appealed their sentences and successfully pursued harsher punishments on the grounds that their crime involved a large-scale unlawful assembly with a high risk of violence. The trio's imprisonment was applauded by the pro-Beijing camp but decried by pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong as well as international politicians and human rights advocates, who have called the activists Hong Kong's first prisoners of conscience, and alleged that the sentence is intended to intimidate other would-be activists. The sentence also disqualifies the three from running for office for five years, quashing their political aspirations in the near future. Wong had previously sought election but was barred due to his age, while Law, democratically elected to the Legislative Council in September 2016, was removed from office in July 2017 following a government challenge. The three activists were released on 6 February 2018 after a successful appeal at the Court of Final Appeal. Background =Activists= Wong (far right) and other student activists protesting in front of the Civic Square on 23 September 2014 Wong, Law, and Chow have been prominent democracy activists for several years. Joshua Wong, now a student at the Open University of Hong Kong, co-founded Scholarism in 2011. Scholarism gained prominence as one of several civil society organisations that protested against the \\"Moral and National Education\\" curriculum, proposed by the Education Bureau. He subsequently participated in the Umbrella Movement and then co-founded a political party, Demosist≈ç, in 2016. Nathan Law is an undergraduate student at Lingnan University as well as the incumbent chairman of Demosist≈ç. He previously occupied various leadership positions in the Lingnan University Students' Union and served as Secretary General of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. During the 2016 Legislative Council election Law ran under the Demosist≈ç banner in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency and was elected, becoming the youngest-ever elected legislator in Hong Kong. On 14 July 2017, Law became one of six pro-democracy legislators removed from office due to legal action by the Hong Kong Government regarding their manners during the oath-taking ceremony. Alex Chow is a University of Hong Kong student, a former vice-president of the Hong Kong University Students' Union, and a former secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. He was one of the early organisers of the Umbrella Movement. =Political context= The Chief Executive is the head of the Government of Hong Kong. Article 45 of Hong Kong's constitution, the Basic Law, stipulates that the \\"ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures\\". Following the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the pro-democratic camp pushed for the election of the chief executive in 2007 through universal suffrage. On 26 April 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), a mainland Chinese legislative body, ruled out the possibility that universal suffrage would be allowed in 2007. In 2007, the NPCSC ruled out the 2012 election of the legislature and chief executive through universal suffrage, but stated that the Legislative Council and the chief executive could be elected through universal suffrage in 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, democratic aspirations stalled on 31 August 2014, when the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing made a decision that chief executive candidates in 2017 would be required to \\"love the country and love Hong Kong\\"; that all candidates would be screened by a nominating committee of a composition paralleling the existing Election Committee, which is dominated by pro-Beijing interests; and that any chief executive elected through these means would then have to be appointed by the Chinese government. The decision was intensely decried by the pan-democratic camp, who said the arrangement would not amount to genuine democracy. =2014 Civic Square protests= The Civic Square, pictured in 2012 and 2014 The incident which led to the sentencing took place in the forecourt of the East Wing of the Central Government Complex, known more commonly as the Civic Square. The new government headquarters was opened in 2011, and was designed under the concept of \\"Door Always Open\\" by architect Rocco Yim to symbolise the pride that Hong Kongers take in \\"openness and transparency of governance\\". In keeping with this design concept, the Civic Square was originally open to the public when the new government headquarters was inaugurated in 2011. The square became a popular site for political demonstrations. In mid-2014, several protests were held there against plans for the development of new towns in the northeastern New Territories. In response, around 16 July 2014 work began on a permanent three-metre high metal fence, closing off the Civic Square from Tim Mei Avenue. The Hong Kong government stated that the barrier was a necessary security measure while others stated that the move ran contrary to Hong Kong people's right to freedom of assembly, which is codified in the Basic Law. The government responded that protests would be allowed in the square on public holidays if the director of the Administration Wing consented in advance. Other areas of the complex were fortified at the same time as the Civic Square. Concurrently with the fortification of the square, the government's controversial democratic reform proposals, coupled with the 831 decision, were triggering discontent and protests. On 22 September 2014, students launched a week-long class boycott campaign, coupled with demonstrations at the government complex. At around 22:30 on 26 September 2014, protesting students scaled the fence that had been erected in July in an attempt to \\"retake\\" the Civic Square. Police managed to regain control of the square, and kettled dozens of protesters on the circular base of the flagpoles, where they were denied access to water and the toilet. At the same time, a large number of protesters amassed outside the Civic Square. The square was cleared by police by the end of the following day, with more than 60 people arrested. Wong, Chow, and Law were among those arrested. Four police officers were injured, one of them suffered a deep wound by an umbrella, and eleven security staff at the government complex were also injured. The incident immediately helped kick off the 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which saw the motorway in front of the government complex, Harcourt Road, occupied by protesters until 11 December 2016. Legal action Eastern Magistrates' Court, where the trio initially received noncustodial sentences in August 2016 =Initial sentencing= On 21 July 2016, the Eastern Magistrates' Court found Wong and Chow guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly, while Law was found guilty of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly. These were the first criminal convictions for all three. Wong was cleared of a charge of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly. On 15 August 2016, the three were sentenced. Wong was ordered to perform 80 hours of community service, while Law was sentenced to 120 hours. Chow was sentenced to three weeks in prison with a one-year suspension to allow him to continue his education at the London School of Economics as planned. Immediately following the sentencing, Law said that they respected the decision of the court, and alleged that the Public Order Ordinance was \\"suppressing [their] freedoms to assemble and protest\\". The trio subsequently served these initial sentences. =Appeal and additional sentence= The Department of Justice disagreed with the sentencing. In September 2016 it requested a review of the sentences, arguing that the community service sentence was \\"clearly not enough\\" as the three \\"[did] not feel true remorse\\". A review hearing was held on 21 September 2016, where the magistrate stated that the original sentencing and reasoning was sufficient, and that the department had \\"failed to provide sufficient evidence for the necessity of a tougher sentence\\". The department had compared the activists to gangsters, which the presiding magistrate, June Cheung, said was unfair as they were expressing their political beliefs. She stated that there were precedents for non-custodial sentences in similar cases, and dismissed the bid to impose harsher sentences on the three. In October 2016, the Court of Appeal agreed to hear a government appeal against the original sentence. right On 17 August 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of all three and enhanced their sentences by imposing six and seven-month prison terms on Wong and Chow, respectively, and sentencing Law to eight months in jail, removing the suspension. The judges found that the case involved a large-scale unlawful assembly with a high risk of violence, and the crimes were serious, calling for deterrent custodial sentences. The sentencing prevented the activists from running for public office in the next five years. Law was previously an elected legislator, while Wong had expressed a desire to seek election in the future, having been unable to run in the 2016 LegCo election for not meeting the minimum age qualification. Imprisonment Pik Uk Correctional Institution, a maximum security youth prison where Wong is held Wong was sent to Pik Uk Correctional Institution, a maximum security facility for male prisoners below the age of 21. Law and Chow were being held at Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre pending their transfer to prison. On 22 August 2017, Law was moved to the medium-security Tong Fuk Correctional Institution on Ma Po Ping Road on Lantau Island, while Chow was moved to the low-security Pik Uk Prison on Clear Water Bay Road, near Sai Kung, to serve their sentences. Reactions =Domestic= The sentence received mixed reactions in Hong Kong. Political figures from the pro-democratic camp and civil rights activists criticised the sentence for being disproportionately long, the Secretary for Justice for appealing the sentence, and the sitting judges for not considering the act committed by Wong, Law and Chow as civil disobedience that would result in a mitigated sentence. On the contrary, pro-establishment politicians welcomed the sentence. The legal profession has also responded to allegations by the media that the Hong Kong judiciary had been influenced or controlled by the Communist Party of China through the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong, stating that there is no indication of such influence. Upon the sentencing, Joshua Wong wrote in a series of tweets that the sentence will not halt the activism for universal suffrage and democracy, or \\"win the hearts and minds of Hong Kongers\\". Other pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong also criticised the court decision. Academic Benny Tai at The University of Hong Kong, who also faces prosecution for his role in the 2014 protests, stated that civil disobedience to \\"challenge the law or acts of injustice by the government\\" is a necessary part of a civilised society. There was also criticism against sentence appeal made by the Secretary of Justice. Lawyer Wilson Leung expressed on behalf of the Progressive Lawyers Group that \\"we strongly disagree with the government treating political problems as ‚Äòlaw and order‚Äô problems and focusing on the prosecution of protestors.\\" Former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association and Civic Party politician Alan Leong commented that the appeal was \\"certainly politically motivated\\". Another former Bar Association chairman Paul Shieh noted however that there is insufficient evidence suggesting that political considerations were involved. Shieh also called on the Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen to explain the reasons behind the appeal so as to increase the transparency of the decision to appeal. The League of Social Democrats held a rally against the decision outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre on the evening of 18 August 2017. Several different organisations held a public protest march on 20 August 2017, which started at the Southorn Playground and ended with a rally at the Court of Final Appeal Building. Protesters focused their criticism on Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, following reports that he ignored the advice of top prosecutors in pursuing the appeal. On the other hand, members of the pro-Beijing camp applauded the prison sentences. Starry Lee, chairwoman of Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing political party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), said that the three \\"paid the price\\" for disobeying the law. DAB vice-chairman Holden Chow called unlawful assembly a \\"serious crime\\" and said that a heavy punishment was necessary to deter others. Pro-Beijing activist Robert Chow asked rhetorically: \\"who worked behind the scenes to poison and brainwash Wong, Law, and Chow, along with thousands of young people, to make them delight in seeing the country and Hong Kong as enemies, in having made Hongkongers suffer for the last three years?\\" =Mainland China= An editorial in the Chinese state newspaper Global Times stated, \\"This sentence will be a milestone in Hong Kong's governance. From now on people who protest violently can be given a guilty sentence following this precedent, and they will need to go to jail\\". Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated: =International= Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen, whose office released a statement expressing Taiwan's \\"deep regret\\" over the jail sentences The Taiwanese government expressed its \\"deep regret\\" over the jail sentences, and reiterated Taiwan's \\"long-standing stance to support Hong Kong people to pursue democracy, freedom, the rule of law and human rights\\". The Democratic Progressive Party stated that \\"graver suppression will only spark more resistance\\", while a government spokesman stated that \\"Hong Kong authorities should take seriously the fact that Hong Kong people want to be able to choose their own way of life and political regime.\\" Nancy Pelosi, leader of the United States Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives, called the ruling an injustice that should \\"shock the conscience of the world\\". She described the prison sentence as an \\"egregious decision\\", and that the resulting disqualification of Wong, Law and Chow to run for public office was unjust. She also regarded the sentence to be against \\"the basic notions of freedom and democracy\\". A group of 25 international figures released a joint statement describing the imprisonment as \\"outrageously unjust\\". The signatories called the Umbrella Movement \\"one of the most peaceful and restrained movements of public protest the world has ever seen\\" and wrote that the sentencing amounted to \\"an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong‚Äôs rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of 'One Country, Two Systems'\\". The statement was signed by eminent politicians, human rights activists, and ex-political prisoners including David Alton, Paddy Ashdown, Sonja Biserko, Charles Maung Bo, Fiona Bruce, John Dayal, Andrew Khoo, David Kilgour, John McCarthy, Mohamed Nasheed, Geoffrey Nice, Consiglio Di Nino, Grover Rees III, Malcolm Rifkind, Janelle Saffin, Charles Santiago, Chris Smith, Charles Tannock, Alissa Wahid, and Zarganar. The group also questioned whether punishing the activists twice (as Wong, Law, and Chow had already served their initial community service orders) contraveneds provisions against double jeopardy in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In September 2017, Hong Kong slipped five places in the judicial independence category of the latest global competitiveness ranking compiled by the Geneva- based non-profit organisation World Economic Forum. =Academics= Eric Cheung, a faculty member at the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, questioned why the Court of Appeal decision described the defendants' actions as \\"seriously violent\\" while earlier the Eastern Magistracy had cleared the trio of committing any acts of violence. He stated that there did not seem to be any evidence presented that the three committed violence, and questioned whether the Court of Appeal had effected a \\"substantial and grave injustice\\". He said there were grounds for the three to appeal the ruling to the Court of Final Appeal, Hong Kong's court of last resort. =Human rights organisations= Various human rights organisations also spoke against the sentencing. A spokesperson for Human Rights Watch stated that the effort to put the trio in jail was \\"not about public order, but is instead a craven political move to keep the trio out of the Legislative Council, as well as deter future protests.\\" Similarly, Mabel Au, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International Hong Kong, commented, \\"the relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities.\\" Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, stated: \\"This is a watershed moment for Hong Kong. It now has political prisoners ... For anyone thinking of protesting, the prospect of a harsh jail sentence will now loom over them.\\" Other jailings This article focuses on the three most well-known activists to be jailed in 2017. The high-profile imprisonment of Wong, Law, and Chow spurred some Hong Kong media outlets to compile lists of all individuals who have been imprisoned for allegedly political reasons. On 15 August 2017, 13 protesters who stormed the Legislative Council building in June 2014 (during a protest against the planned North East New Territories new towns) were handed prison sentences of eight to 13 months after a similar push by the Department of Justice for more severe sentences than the community service orders originally imposed.

After the band and label boss Tony Wilson were unanimous in their dislike of Another Setting (1983), Wilson pushed the band towards progressing to a new, classical-inspired sound. The band went on to record Short Stories for Pauline, which went unreleased when Wilson refused to release it, though one track, \\"Little Mercy\\", kept Wilson's attention. He asked the band to use it as the foundation for a different album, ultimately becoming Without Mercy. With a dramatically extended line- up, featuring classical musicians such as cello player Caroline Lavelle and Tuxedomoon violinist Blaine L. Reininger, Without Mercy was recorded in Strawberry Studios. It was partly an attempt by Wilson to push Durutti Column band leader Vini Reilly into spending more than three days recording an album, although the album was recorded in only five days. The album is an album- length, two-part modern classical piece, also titled \\"Without Mercy\\", using the narrative of John Keats' poem \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\", which also gives the album its name. Using a blend of new and old instruments, the piece is subdued and orchestrated, with strong elements of minimalist and chamber music. The extended line-up premiered the album at Hammersmith's Riverside Studios in October 1984 before playing at Wilson's nightclub The Hacienda and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. The album sleeve, designed by 8vo and featuring Henri Matisse's Trivaux Pond painting glued onto card, has been cited as innovative. Upon its release, the album reached number 8 on the UK Indie Albums Chart and also found success in Japan. Critics have been generally favourable, generally complimenting the piece's peaceful nature and seeing it as a progression in the band's sound, though some contemporary and retrospectives have more mixed opinions, and Reilly has disowned the album. The album has been re-released several times. Background Although the Manchester-based Durutti Column's third album, Another Setting (1983), moved the band away from its post-punk-derived dream pop sound and into a somewhat chamber music-derived style, Durutti Column leader Vini Reilly, alongside Tony Wilson, the head of the band's label Factory Records, were displeased with the record, with Wilson especially finding it too similar to the band's previous album LC (1981). He recalled: \\"Another Setting trod the same ground as L.C. and took nothing forward. It was time for a change.\\" The group subsequently recorded a new album, Short Stories for Pauline, in Brussels in early 1983, a largely instrumental album, while touring Belgium with poet Anne Clark. However, with Wilson being displeased with Short Stories for Pauline, the album went unreleased for many decades until LTM Recordings released it in 2011, highlighting the deteriorating relationship between Reilly and Wilson. Nonetheless, one track from the album, a \\"superlative instrumental for piano and violin\\" entitled \\"Little Mercy,\\" also known as \\"Duet\\" or \\"La Douleur\\", in which Reilly was accompanied by violinist Blaine L. Reininger of Tuxedomoon, caught Wilson's attention in particular. With the Pauline album shelved, Wilson asked that Reilly develop and expand \\"Little Mercy\\" into a full album, complete with orchestration, pushing Reilly and the Durutti Column into modern classical composition, resulting in the conceiving of Without Mercy. In the words of Factory biographer James Nice, \\"Tony Wilson hoped that Vini Reilly might yet become Bohuslav Martinu or Philip Glass.\\" Wilson credits Factory Records for conceiving the album and the line-up of \\"musicians for Vini to create for\\", after three classical musicians from Manchester University and the Royal Northern College of Music, including a saxophonist and trumpeter, were curious if Factory had any work for them, and after the label had formed a relationship \\"with the wonderful Peter Hadfield acting for statuesque cello player, Caroline Lavelle.\\" Factory also contacted Reininger again, who Wilson felt was \\"always on hand with his Michel Duval impersonations and electrifying violin work.\\" In Wilson's recollection, the first meeting between the extended line-up was at the farm in Cheshire belonging to Factory co-founder Alan Erasmus and his wife, which Erasmus felt \\"[gets] more people [...] than at the Hacienda.\\" Recording The Durutti Column's line-up (at the time consisting of Vini Reilly and percussionist Bruce Mitchell), was temporarily extended for the orchestral Without Mercy, now including Blaine Reininger (violin, viola), Caroline Lavelle (cello), Marvyn Fletcher (saxophone), Tim Kellett (trumpet), Maunagh Fleming (cor anglais and oboe) and Richard Henry (trombone). Reilly played guitar, piano and bass and, in addition to Mitchell, who performed numerous percussive instruments, also programmed Oberheim DMX drum machines on the album. The album was recorded at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, with Wilson co-producing the album ‚Äì his first production on a Durutti Column album ‚Äì with Michael Johnson, who also engineered the record. Johnson was best known for typically engineering New Order's records. The album was subsequently mixed at Britannia Row Studios and mastered at CTS Studios. The recording of Without Mercy was also an attempt on the behalf of Wilson to get Reilly to spend more than only three days in the recording of a Durutti Column album, \\"to try and slow down the process,\\" thereby \\"stretching the recording possibilities of the simplistic Durutti Column;\\" Mick Middles of The Quietus reflected: \\"Quite why the anti-punk aspects of this exercise didn't dawn on him remains an intriguing question.\\" Without Mercy was subsequently recorded in only five days, which Wilson deemed \\"an abject failure.\\" Music John Keats' poem \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" (here illustrated by Frank Dicksee) forms the album's narrative. Using \\"Little Mercy\\" as its foundation, Without Mercy is a two-part, album-length instrumental piece or musical suite, with the first part (\\"Without Mercy 1\\") on side one and the second part (\\"Without Mercy 2\\") on side two. It expands greatly upon the classical orchestration and accompaniment which were present on Another Setting, especially via the appearance of the numerous additional musicians, and the inclusion of instruments as disperse as trumpet, viola and cor anglais, alongside Mitchell's percussion and Veilly's work on guitar, keyboard and bass, contribute to a blend of new and old instruments. John Keats' ballad poem \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" (1819) was used for the album's narrative, which Wilson described as \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl and no birds sing.\\" Prendergast described the album as an orchestral \\"musical setting\\" for Keats' poem. The name of the poem also gives the album its name. According to critic Ned Raggett, \\"reflection and subdued but not inactive performing are the key\\", even during the album's busiest moments, with many points of the album being somewhat reminiscent of Erik Satie, while \\"Reilly is almost always, either via keyboards or his guitar, front and center.\\" Reinginer's violin and viola and Lavelle's cello are said to add \\"even more classical atmosphere\\" to the album. The album is delicate, and often particularly minimalist in nature. Peter Mills of Rough Guides compared Without Mercy to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. Critics regard the record as a delve into modern classical and chamber music. The entire composition is \\"underpinned by a recurrent, mournful piano riff, plaintive violin and stirring brass.\\" \\"Without Mercy 1\\" begins with Reilly's melancholic piano, followed by oboe from Manaugh Fleming and trumpet from Tim Kellet alongside Reilly's guitar, \\"adding in here and there as needed while the track unfolds further to [a] Reilly guitar solo.\\" Trouser Press felt it was \\"like modern chamber music, an ambitious and shifting mixture of piano, horns, strings and electronic percussion.\\" An entire studio group is used on \\"Without Mercy 2,\\" which favours guitar. Blaine Reininger reprises his role as violinist from \\"Little Mercy\\". Roughly eight minutes into the second side, \\"funky horns and beats\\" start to appear. Release The album was premiered at Hammersmith's Riverside Studios (pictured in 2008). Without Mercy was released in the United Kingdom by Factory Records in October 1984 with the catalog number FACT 84, and was also concurrently released in Spain and Italy. It was only the third Factory album to be officially advertised in the music press, via a New Brutalist-styled half-page advert in the NME reading \\"Durutti Column Piss on The Art of Noise.\\" The album had already been premiered live in August 1984 at London's Riverside Studios with the nine-piece \\"orchestra,\\" followed by further performances at Wilson's Manchester nightclub The Hacienda on 12 December and at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London shortly after. The band's drummer Bruce Mitchell later contended that \\"Without Mercy demonstrated Tony's flair for marketing and PR. It definitely changed perceptions of Vini as a composing musician, so it was an accurate reading of the media. But Vini had to be forced to do it.\\" The album sleeve, described by Nice as a \\"genuinely classic sleeve,\\" was the first project completed by typographically-led design studio 8vo, a collaboration between Mark Holt and Simon Johnston that had been approached after Factory's in-house designer Peter Saville \\"made little progress on his first Durutti sleeve,\\" and the success of the Without Mercy sleeve meant that 8vo became Durutti's sleeve designers of choice thereafter. It features Henri Matisse's scenic painting Trivaux Pond (1916‚Äì17) glued onto recycled pulp board, alongside letterpress- printed type \\"reminiscent of the flowing poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire,\\" with both the flow and the font on the sleeve chosen to reflect the post- impressionist period of Matisse's painting. With the painting being physically glued onto the sleeve, it was cited as an innovative sleeve by Prendergast. Reception and legacy Without Mercy was a relative commercial success, reaching number 8 on the UK Independent Albums Chart, and also bringing the band strong success in Japan, where the group would record the CD-only live album Domo Arigato the following year. Without Mercy also received positive reviews from contemporary critics, though, with Reilly moving in an increasingly less \\"rock\\" direction, they struggled to find suitable frames of reference, with reviewer Martin Aston calling it \\"a source of fragility that approaches the minimal mastery of Eno or even Erik Satie, employing both the drifting dream states of the former and the frozen delicacy of the latter.\\" Aston was favourable towards the record, saying \\"Reilly, single-handedly, could alter the meaning of easy listening, and with this in mind, it's about time that this strain of musical input found a more comfortable home than that of the elite and esoteric.\\" Although unsure of the album's second side, Sounds called the album \\"beautiful without being cloying\\" and \\"quietly impressive.\\" Steph Paynes of the NME were more reserved, saying the album was \\"one good idea stretched to album length\\": \\"The tune eventually evolves into variations of itself. But it does so without a clear direction and without much adventure. Some of the gestures work nicely; others are inappropriate, inserted for the sake of change.\\" Band biographer James Nice later reflected: \\"'Duet' says everything it needs to say in two and a half minutes. Stretched across the entire Without Mercy album, more became less.\\" Other retrospective reviews have been favourbale, with Ned Raggett of AllMusic saying: \\"It's very self-consciously romantic (track and album are in fact named for Keats' noted poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci), but the combination of new and old instruments, plus the continuation of the unique Durutti sheen and shine in the recording quality, results in quietly touching heights.\\" As with many other Durutti Column LPs, Reilly dislikes the album, once telling a writer for The Quietus that he jokingly calls it \\"Without Merit,\\" and reflecting: \\"Without Mercy is a joke. [...] It was all Tony Wilson's idea to make it more classical. He had aspirations that I should be taken more seriously. That never interested me. Everyone's obsessed with form. 'Is it avant-garde? Is it jazz?' It's just tunes.\\" He elaborated: \\"That album was Tony Wilson saying to me, ‚ÄòYou've done so many albums the way you wanted to do them, and when you wanted to do them, so just this once make this my record and do it my way.' He's one of my best friends, so of course I said yeah. And that's Without Mercy. There were all these studio classical musicians involved. For me it doesn't actually work. It was more of a learning process really.\\" =Reissues= In March 1988, Without Mercy was re-issued on as part of Durutti Column ‚Äì The First Four Albums, a four-CD box set that remastered the album, alongside its predecessors in the band's discography, in full digital stereo.

Two women were killed in the attack and eight people sustained injuries. Police were informed at 16:02. Three minutes later the attacker, Abderrahman Bouanane, a Moroccan rejected asylum seeker, had been detained. At the time of his arrest, Bouanane was using the name Abderrahman Mechkah, which was later discovered to be a false identity. In June 2018, Bouanane was found guilty of two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent. It was the first time anybody had been sentenced for a terrorist crime in Finland. Bouanane reportedly identified as a soldier of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He had been radicalised three months before the stabbing took place. During the investigation, he was discovered possessing ISIS propaganda material and a video of him reciting a manifesto. Background Finland had not experienced terrorist attacks and had faced very little political violence since the end of World War II. In June 2017, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service assessed the overall terrorist threat as level two (\\"elevated\\") on its four-tier scale. According to the Service, the most significant terrorist threat in Finland was at the time \\"posed by individual actors or small groups motivated by radical Islamist propaganda or terrorist organisations encouraging them.\\" Europol's assessment of terrorism threats in the European Union (EU) in 2016 was similar to that of the Service: > The terrorist threat in the EU in 2016 emanated from remotely directed > individuals operating alone or in small groups, and those that may have been > inspired by terrorist propaganda, but not directed. The former are receiving > direction and personal instruction from, and are possibly being facilitated > by, a terrorist organisation. The latter are individual attackers, possibly > but not necessarily being helped by family and/or friends as accomplices. > They are inspired by jihadist propaganda and messaging, but not necessarily > receiving personal direction or instruction from any group. Between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2017, Finland received thousand asylum applications. Bouanane arrived in Finland at the beginning of 2016 and was a \\"rejected asylum seeker.\\" He had previously lived as an illegal alien in Germany and had committed crimes there under several different identities from the end of 2015 until early 2016 without seeking asylum. He had no prior convictions in Finland according to the Finnish Legal Register Centre, but the Finnish Security Intelligence Service confirmed receiving, in early 2017, a non-specific tip-off that Bouanane appeared to be becoming radicalised and was interested in extremist ideology. The tip-off did not contain information suggesting an actual attack. According to persons interviewed at the Pansio asylum-seeker reception centre by national broadcaster Yle, Abderrahman Bouanane arrived at the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking how he could join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels (kuffƒÅr). The interviewees warned the reception centre management of the behaviour in January 2017. Helsingin Sanomat published similar interviews afterward. Yle also reported that the police were at the time monitoring approximately 100 young asylum seeker men in the Southwest Finland area and that police believed Bouanane had radicalized fairly quickly during August; for example, his behaviour and clothing style had changed. Bouanane was not one of the 350 individuals monitored by the Finnish Security Intelligence Service for terrorism- prevention purposes. According to concluding remarks by the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) after the case was closed, Bouanane told during his interrogations that he started having an interest in ISIS propaganda three months prior to the attack. Police believed he was a lone wolf and there was no evidence of direct contact between any terrorist organization and him. Bouanane possessed ISIS material, such as photos and videos, on his mobile phone and his computer; his close friends believed he displayed signs of radicalization. Bouanane saw himself as a soldier of ISIS and said one motive for his attack were airstrikes by the Western Coalition during the 2017 Battle of Raqqa in Syria. According to NBI, his vision was to die in the attack as a martyr similarly to previous attacks in Europe that he admired. He hoped that ISIS would claim his attack‚Äîalthough this did not happen.  Attack and casualties  alt= Around noon of 18 August 2017, Abderrahman Bouanane took two kitchen knives with him and cycled from a friend's place in Kaarina to downtown Turku, where he attended a Muslim prayer at a mosque next to the river Aura. From there, he proceeded to a park outside Turku Cathedral and read a manifesto he had drafted on video. The manifesto was religiously inspired and contained, among others, discussion on the infidelity of Western nations as well as how oppressed Muslims should act. Bouanane disseminated the video to a group chat on an instant messaging service. Next, he moved to the local bus station where he intended to attack a military conscript, believing a soldier to be a valid target. Bouanane cancelled after other people arrived at the scene and he moved to Turku Market Square. At around 16:02, Bouanane, armed with the two knives, stabbed four people at the west corner of Market Square. The Emergency Response Centre alerted all nearby police patrols to the incident. Bouanane stabbed six more people while yelling \\"Allahu akbar\\" and running towards Puutori, approximately away. Bystanders intervened in the attacks and chased the attacker while simultaneously warning other people. When police confronted Bouanane stabbing a victim at street address Brahenkatu 14 near Puutori, he ignored verbal orders and was immobilised with a single shot to the thigh and a taser at 16:05. He was given first aid and taken into custody. Two people died as a result of the attack: one at the scene of the incident, and another in hospital. Eight victims were non-fatally wounded, of whom three were critically injured. One of the victims was under 18, the others were adults. Eight of the victims were female and two male. One of the wounded was British, one Italian and one Swedish; both of the fatalities were Finnish women. The Italian citizen did not receive critical injuries while Hassan Zubier, a British paramedic living in Sweden, was injured four times as he tried to help a victim. Zubier, hailed as a hero by Finnish media, was open about the incident and appeared on national television to discuss it. He stated that after he had rushed to treat a bleeding woman injured during the attack, Bouanane stabbed him several times. Zubier suffered a severed spinal cord and severe nerve damage and lost his mobility. He was critical of some by-standers who took photos and videos of the scene instead of helping and partly blamed the media for this kind of behaviour. The police suspected early on that the attacker had purposely chosen females as his victims, as the male victims were injured while trying to help other victims or stop the attacker. It was later discovered that the attacker had previously planned attacks at different sites, which would have included male casualties. Thus, police no longer had reason to believe that the casualties were picked based on their sex.  Aftermath  Candles at the Turku Market Square a few hours after the incident Turku City Library and Hansa shopping centre were evacuated, and police initially advised people to avoid the city centre area. Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipil√§ tweeted on 18 August 2017, at 17:09: \\"The Government is closely following the events in Turku and the on-going police operation. The Government will meet later today.\\" Finnish police increased security across the whole nation, such as at Helsinki Airport and Helsinki Central railway station along with other transport hubs across Finland. A crisis service hotline and an on-site crisis service point were established in the Turku area and the number of on-call social workers was doubled. Flags were flown half- mast on 19 August and a national moment of silence was held at the Market Square on 20 August. The attack prompted the Finnish Government, Members of Parliament and the President of Finland Sauli Niinist√∂ to discuss fast- tracking the intelligence and surveillance bill in motion to prevent future attacks. The bill proposed to enhance national security against serious threats with both civilian and military intelligence; it included new surveillance powers such as network traffic surveillance and intelligence gathering abroad. Prime Minister Juha Sipil√§ commented on the need for intelligence gathering reform that \\"it should be obvious from a constitutional standpoint that the right to life is a more precious fundamental right than the right to privacy in light of the Turku event.\\" Similarly, the event sparked discussion on adjusting asylum and immigration policies, such as returning rejected asylum seekers more rigorously and increasing judicial deterrent on illegal stays. Director of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service Antti Pelttari believed deportation centres for rejected asylum seekers and intensified returns would be beneficial from a security point of view. Interior Minister Paula Risikko did not find the suggestion feasible‚Äîas the residents of such centres are not placed under constant surveillance, but are only required to check in regularly. A photo taken by press photographer Liisa Huima depicting a police officer kneeling beside the lying Abderrahman Bouanane after his detainment at 16:24 was chosen as the news photo of the year in Finland. It was considered to be an illustration of the police officers' response during an exceptional event as well as a reminder of how important freedom of the press is. According to the jury, it is \\"a classical photograph of an event where the news are currently in motion\\" and it summarizes the most important news story of the year \\"straightforwardly and without aesthetics\\". In December 2017, a Facebook fundraiser was launched to financially support Hassan Zubier who was injured while assisting another victim of the attack. On 25 June 2018, Zubier became the first foreign person to be awarded Finland's Life Saving Medal for helping a victim and protecting others during the attack. On 19 July 2018, he was also presented the George Medal for his actions. Zubier applied for Finnish state pension based on injuries he suffered during the attack, but admitted in August 2018 to benefits fraud by forging work history in his application. Prior, the Finnish State Treasury () discovered that he had not worked at the designated ambulance company during the dates specified in his application. Furthermore, the signee on the documentation provided by Zubier was not an employee of the company.  Investigation  alt= = 18‚Äì20 August = At 19:00 on 18 August 2017, the police held a press conference where they reported that the nature of the attack had not yet been established. On 19 August at 14:00, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) announced that the arrested main suspect was an 18-year-old Moroccan man, and that the case was suspected to be a terrorist attack. NBI reported that police had raided a flat in the Varissuo suburb of Turku, home to a large immigrant population, and an asylum-seekers' reception centre in the Pansio suburb of Turku overnight between 18 and 19 August. Four more persons were arrested while one person was placed under an international arrest warrant. A white Fiat Ducato belonging to one of the suspects was seized during the raids. The Finnish Security Intelligence Service deemed that the terrorist threat assessment level would remain unchanged from level two (\\"elevated\\"). According to the Service's assessment at the time, Bouanane's profile was similar to that of several other recent radical Islamist terrorist attacks that have taken place in Europe and the Service considered the incident to be the first suspected terrorist strike in Finland. On the morning of 20 August, NBI conducted an approximately 45-minute re-enactment of the event at Market Square and Puutori as a normal method of investigating serious crimes. Additional locations were searched in the Runosm√§ki suburb of Turku and persons connected to the case were interviewed. NBI gathered photographic and video evidence from the public through a WhatsApp account. = 21‚Äì25 August = On 21 August, Bouanane was named by authorities as Abderrahman Mechkah‚Äîalthough the name was subsequently shown to be false. He remained in hospital on 21 August, but no longer in intensive care. NBI requested he be remanded during pre-trial investigations. Bouanane and three of the suspected associates were remanded into pre-trial detention on 22 August by the district court of Southwest Finland () on suspicion of two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent. He admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder with terrorist intent. The motive of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared the person from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. On 23 August, two more suspects were detained on suspicion of preparing to commit crimes with terrorist intent. The two were subsequently interviewed; and one of them released and cleared of charges later on. As of 24 August, four suspects were in pre-trial detention, one arrested, one under an international arrest warrant and two cleared. = 26 August ‚Äì 7 February = On 26 August, NBI reported that they had released the second suspect arrested on 23 August and cleared the person of all charges. On 27 August, it was reported that Abderrahman Mechkah was not the main suspect's real name, nor was he 18-years old as previously thought. He was later confirmed to be 22-year-old Abderrahman Bouanane. Two of the remanded suspects were released and cleared of all charges on 31 August. Reports also described the suspect placed under an international arrest warrant as a 23-year-old Finnish citizen born in Uzbekistan suspected of supporting Bouanane's radical thoughts. (As of September 2018, the wanted suspect had contacted NBI with the intent to clear the matter, but he had not been questioned nor was his exact location known.) NBI commented that the investigation will continue for months in part due to the need to translate Arabic material. The fourth remanded accessory suspect was released from detention and cleared of charges on 1 September, leaving Bouanane as the only one remaining in custody. Bouanane was ordered on 12 October by the district court to undergo a psychiatric evaluation‚Äîa request he had made early into the investigation; the results determined that Bouanane was fully aware of his actions. On 19 October, the Finnish Government established an independent inquiry team to investigate the stabbing and provide recommendations on how new attacks could be prevented. NBI held a press conference on 7 February 2018 to report that the investigation was concluded and the material, spanning some 1,400 pages, would be forwarded to the Finnish Prosecution Office. During the same press conference, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service reiterated that there was no apparent need to change the terrorist threat level from level two (\\"elevated\\").  Trial  Bouanane was charged by the prosecution with two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent on 27 February 2018. According to the relevant authorities, the defendant had been acting compos mentis and was therefore competent to stand trial. The case came before the district court of Southwest Finland, the court of first instance under whose jurisdiction Turku comes. The preliminary hearing began on 20 March. The actual trial started on 9 April, and was expected to last until mid-May. On 15 June, Bouanane was found guilty of murder with terrorist intent on two counts, and of attempted murder with terrorist intent on eight counts. He was sentenced to life in prison; according to Finnish law, he is required to serve at least 12 years of this before being eligible for parole. The verdict was described as the first time anybody had been sentenced for a terrorist crime in Finland. Reuters wrote after the ruling that the stabbing represented the \\"first militant Islamist attack\\" in Finland and Finnish Jihadism researcher Atte Kaleva iterated that \\"the ruling confirms radical Islamist terrorism's entry into Finland.\\" Bouanane appealed the court's decision on the last possible day for appeals. However, in January 2019, Bouanane withdrew his appeal.  Reactions  Candles and flowers near the attack start point on 26 August 2017 Prime Minister Juha Sipil√§ remarked during a press conference on 19 August 2017: \\"If the criminal charge is confirmed to be terror-related murder, that would be a first in Finland. We have feared this. The day before in Barcelona and now in Turku. We are no longer an island.\\" He added: \\"This act was cowardly and reprehensible. The killing of innocent people is a violation of humanity and of religions' principles. We are however all in the same boat and we must defend humanity so that hate is not answered with hate.\\" Interior Minister Paula Risikko said on Twitter on 19 August: \\"Terrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred.\\" On 19 August, protesters from anti-immigration and anti-racism groups staged demonstrations near the site of the stabbing. The Islamic Council of Finland and the Moroccan Forum in Finland strongly condemned the attack and denounced the use of violence and hatred on 20 August. Several international leaders offered their condolences to the victims of the attacks.

It was released on August 9, 2017, under Warner Music Japan in three editions: Regular Edition, Limited Edition, and a fan club-only Boice Limited Edition. Summer Calling went on to debut at number three on Japan's national weekly Oricon Albums Chart. The singer is set to embark on the Jung Yong-hwa Concert 2017 \\"Summer Calling\\" tour from August to October in Osaka, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Kobe. Content and packaging Summer Calling compromises four tracks previously released on Jung's Korean mini- album Do Disturb (2017), in addition to four new tracks. It was released in three editions: a Regular Edition; a Limited Edition that includes the music video and a special feature of \\"Summer Dream\\", and a Boice Edition that comes with a Yong-hwa Summer Bracelet. Music structure Summer Calling is a pop record. Describing it as a summer album, Jung sought to create a \\"fresh\\" and \\"bright\\" atmosphere with his music. Feeling that balladry suits winter, he decided against including a standard ballad on the record. \\"Summer Dream\\" was described as a \\"trendy\\" dance track claimed to \\"cool off the summer heat\\". \\"Closer\\" is a light medium tempo song. In its lyrics, the narrator \\"asks his love to stick by his side\\". \\"Not Anymore\\" is a R&B-pop; ballad which serves homage to the sound and lyricism of the 1990s by following the melodic progression and the implementation of a synthesizer common during that time period. It deals with the mourning of a breakup. \\"Password\\" is an \\"addictive\\" deep house track. His first attempt at the genre, he described as a \\"party\\" song with elements of pop music which fixates around \\"repetitive\\" hooks and lyrics. The album closes with \\"Navigation\\", a song which consists of piano and strings, as well as a \\"calm\\" melody. Set in medium-tempo, the song opens with the sound of ocean waves. It is a \\"lyrical\\" song which was inspired by his \\"poor sense of direction\\". The lyrics hint as \\"social isolation\\", but also intends to \\"cheer up the listener\\". Jung noted that \\"dreams and goals\\" help him \\"navigate\\" his life, and feels \\"lost\\" without them. Release and promotion On June 20, 2017, a music video teaser for \\"Summer Dream\\" was unveiled on YouTube. The full music video was released on July 20, featuring model Laren Tsai as Jung's romantic partner. Serving as the lead single for the album, \\"Summer Dream\\" was released as a digital download on July 26. An album digest was uploaded two days later. He is scheduled to embark on the Jung Yong-hwa Concert 2017 \\"Summer Calling\\" tour. The first pair of concerts will take place between August 22‚Äì23 at the Festival Hall in Osaka, followed by three concerts between August 29‚Äì31 at Pacifico Yokohama in Kanagawa. Additional concerts were added, which will take place between September 9‚Äì10 at the Makuhari Messe Event Hall in Chiba and October 7‚Äì8 at the World Memorial Hall in Kobe.

German Pacific colonies not shown The May 1912 Reichstag debate on interracial marriage was the most significant and explicit discussion of (colonial) racial biopolitics on a national level in the German Empire before World War I. It served as a preparation for the legal regulation of such marriages in the German colonial empire and of the status of children from such unions. It is evidence of the racial-political ideas of German political parties at the time and also of the precursors of the more aggressive racism of the interwar period. The debate can be seen as part of an international tendency at the time to strengthen the barriers between the colonisers and the colonised.Birthe Kundrus: Moderne Imperialisten, p. 219 f.: In 1909, the British government banned sexual relations between their colonial officers and native women. In French West Africa, relations between Frenchmen and native women were promoted at first but were more and more despised later. In 1903, a law in South Rhodesia banned sexual relations between white women and black men. Initiatives for similar treatment of the opposite case failed. Prelude Most German colonial administrations came to prohibit marriages between Germans and indigenous people. Such a ban on \\"civil marriages between whites and natives\\" had been enacted in South West Africa in 1905. The governor of East Africa reserved for himself the right to decide in such cases in 1906. Even marriages contracted before this ban were nullified in South West Africa in 1907. The Reichstag was not consulted for these administrative ordinances. On 17 January 1912, the Reich Colonial Office led by State Secretary Wilhelm Solf enforced a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate mixed-race children for Samoa, on top of the previous marriage ban. Only those children who had been entered into special lists before, could claim a right to citizenship and alimony. All children born later (who, by the new law, had to be extramarital anyway) were treated as illegitimate, without claims to their fathers or their country. In March 1912 in the Reich Budget Commission for the Colonies, the Social Democrats requested the legalisation of mixed marriages and the right to alimony also for extramarital children. Concurrently, a resolution was put before the Federal Council to draw up a law restricting the colonies' ability for ordinances and extending the Reichstag's influence there. According to reports of 1907 and 1908, there were 34 mixed- race couples and 170 mixed-race people in New Guinea; 90 couples and 938 descendants in Samoa; 42 couples and 3,595 descendants in South West Africa (among them the Basters whose loyalty in putting down the Herero uprising was noted). Course of the Debate Wilhelm Solf in 1911 In the 53rd meeting of the Reichstag's 13th session, on 2 May 1912, State Secretary for the Colonies Wilhelm Solf initiated a fundamental debate on the mixed-race question and the problem of mixed marriages, depicting it in dramatic terms.Reichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1648A ff. He argued, the \\"vicious consequences of mixed marriages\\" to be recognised by all nations whose \\"calling for colonisation brought them in touch with coloured peoples of low culture and inferior civilisation.\\" He pointed out the United States as a special example: \\"Misunderstood humanity takes its toll, just as the undignified descent down to the inferior race.\\" Solf proclaimed to be \\"against slavery, self-evidently\\", but he claimed, \\"the Negro must have felt better in the old, patriarchal conditions of the Old South than he is feeling now, internally, as a human.\\" Today, \\"the Negro could even become President if he is not lynched before.\\" Solf argued that lynchings would continue to occur until \\"national law and popular sentiment are in agreement.\\" Afterwards, he appealed to the deputies (all male) to consider whether they wanted \\"black daughters-in-law\\" and \\"woolly-haired grandchildren.\\" The German Colonial Society, he said, was spending 50,000 Mark annually for \\"white girls\\" to be sent to South West Africa. Solf: \\"Do you want that these white girls return with Hereros, with Hottentots and Bastards as spouses?\\" He resumed his point with: \\"We are Germans, we are whites, and we want to stay Germans.\\" In relation to the \\"coloureds\\", \\"even the proletarian is a master\\", he added. Therefore, Solf turned explicitly to the Social Democrats, the parliament's strongest party since 1912, for support, arguing that not the wealthy man would be tempted \\"out there\\" to marry an indigenous woman, but \\"the poor man, the little man.\\" However, Wilhelm Solf, who was considered liberal and understanding when he was governor of German Samoa from 1900 to 1911, did not find the wide support he wished for. Georg Ledebour, a Social Democrat, answered that Solf did not really care for the institution of marriage but for the legitimacy of the offspring. He arguedReichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1649 B ff.: \\"As soon as these young people in their most vigorous age come into contact with subdued peoples, when there are no or only so few white women that they could not enter marriage at all\\", mixed-race children would then be the \\"inevitable result in all colonies, not only Germany's.\\" To avoid this, the colonies would have to be abandoned, while Solf only wanted to \\"eradicate the intercourse.\\" Ledebour criticised the mixed-marriage ban with special reference to Samoa where there were about 80 of them. Exactly because Samoans were closer to whites culturally than Hereros or Hottentots, intercourse with them was of a higher level, he argued. The Social Democrat accused Solf of the fear that \\"the influx of white blood\\" into Samoa would give rise to \\"a part-white, part-Samoan population, like the Basters of South West Africa who descended from Dutchmen and Hottentots\\", which would strengthen the natives' ability to resist. Thereby, Ledebour adopted an argument of Friedrich von Lindequist, governor of South West Africa, who had warned in 1906 in a paper on colonial policy about \\"the numbers of mixed unions\\" and \\"the vicious consequences of racial mixing\\", \\"because in South Africa, the white minority is forced to keep up its rule over coloured people by maintaining its racial purity.\\" Although Lebedour spoke as a critic of \\"capitalist colonial policy\\" and of its need to maintain whites as \\"master race separate from the natives\\", but nevertheless he saw it as \\"an undesirable state [...] when marriages between natives and whites are contracted or when there [is] extramarital intercourse resulting in mixed-race people.\\" He was also filled with indignation by \\"white women flirting with negroes here in Germany.\\" He also pointed out the \\"unpleasant\\" fact that \\"certain women\\" had developed a \\"perverse affinity\\" to \\"exotic tribals\\", calling this a sign of bourgeois decadence. The liberal deputy Carl Braband (Free-minded People's Party) similarly criticised during the debateReichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1730 B ff. that at the occasion of \\"displays of exotic troupes of Nubians, Negroes and Singhalese\\", \\"white women almost threw themselves at the foreign guests.\\" Braband rejected mixed-marriages and the resulting children as a plainly pathological phenomenon and advocated at the same time for the \\"prevention\\" of \\"marriage between persons with severe infectious or hereditary diseases.\\" In the light of the large gender imbalance among whites in the colonies, he conceded \\"sexual mixing\\" between colonists and \\"coloured women\\" to be inevitable. But he saw the \\"growth of a mixed race\\" as a \\"danger\\" which the German \\"Man of Culture\\" could only counter by carefully supervising the mixed-breeds' educations.\\" Karl von Richthofen-Damsdorf, a National Liberal, regarded \\"sexual unions between whites and coloureds\\" as a \\"sexual immorality\\" which should not be \\"officially approved of.\\"Reichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1728 A ff. Rev. Johannes Z√ºrn, a Protestant pastor of the German Reich Party, put forward the hypothesis that \\"children arising from mixed marriages [develop] towards the bad side.\\" He invoked \\"healthy, national race- consciousness\\" and condemned \\"any facilitation of racial mixing in our colonies.\\"Reichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1732 C ff. Karl von B√∂hlendorff-K√∂lpin (German Conservative Party) demanded a \\"sharp segregation\\" of the races and \\"educating our colonial citizens\\" against mixed marriages and cohabitation. He argued that even the head of the Catholic mission in South West Africa called brothels \\"the lesser evil\\" in contrast with these \\"immoral\\" practices. Reinhard Mumm, a Christian Socialist of the Economic Union,Reichstagsprotokolle, 19112,14,3, pp. 1735 A ff. criticised that \\"a certain female lowlife\\" in the big cities \\"associates with Black men\\" and demanded as the \\"sharpest reaction\\" enshrining the rejection of such \\"racial defilement\\" in \\"the people's consciousness.\\" However, the Christian Socialists regarded a marriage ban as ineffective as the neighbouring colonial powers had no such laws, and thereby a marriage could easily be contracted on their territory. Therefore, Mumm advocated promoting the \\"marriage among whites in the colonies\\" and sending only \\"married officials to the colonies.\\" Eduard David (SPD) Eduard David, a revisionist Social Democrat, held a more relaxed and less racist position. He argued that the offspring of such pairings were an \\"eminently beautiful and healthy people.\\" Appearances could be found there that had to be regarded as \\"typical beauties of the human race.\\" Race loyalty fails there, he said, or it would be inverted into its opposite: some whites might want not to degrade but to improve their progeny by such a union. But even David conceded: \\"We do not wish either that a mixed population is engendered haphazardly.\\" Centrist leader Mattias Erzberger in 1919 The Centrist deputy Adolf Gr√∂ber agreed with David in praising beauty. He showed pictures of a \\"Bastard girl\\" and of Samoan girls in parliament and commented: \\"Quite nice. You can't find nicer ones among our ones.\\" The Centre argued for legalising these unions, also because of their numerical insignificance. Mattias Erzberger, leader of the Centrists, also argued \\"against the proliferation of mixed-breeds.\\" \\"99 per cent of all mixed-breeds in the colonies result from extramarital intercourse\\", he claimed. Therefore it were nonsense to ban mixed marriages, as the fight against miscegenation had to be fought by fighting cohabitation, not by banning marriage which would only increase cohabitation. Results At the end of its debate, the Reichstag passed a resolution on 8 May 1912 that asked the government to draw up a law to \\"ensure the validity of marriages between whites and natives in all German colonies\\" and to determine the rights of illegitimate children. 203 deputies (Social Democrats, Centre and some Free-minders) voted Yea, 133 voted Nay, and 1 abstained. However, this law was never drawn up or passed as World War I began only two years later, at the end of which Germany lost all her colonies.

Systematics  Leucothrix Oersted, 1844 is the type genus of the family Leucothricaceae Buchanan, 1957, but has also been classified in the family Thiotrichaceae (Gammaproteobacteria). There are two species described, L. mucor Oersted, 1844 (type species) and L. pacifica Zhang et al., 2015.  Description  Leucothrix is a large bacterium that forms filaments between 2-3 ¬µm wide and up to 0.5 cm in length. They are usually found as epiphytes on marine plants and algae, but also grow attached to other surfaces like the shells of crustaceans. Like the related genus Thiothrix, individual cells can be released from filaments, forming \\"gonidia\\", which can disperse and colonize new surfaces. On a new surface, the gonidial cells associate, produce a holdfast, and develop into rosettes of new filaments. Filaments of L. mucor can sometimes grow into knots when cultivated in the laboratory under certain conditions. Physiologically, Leucothrix are chemoheterotrophic, which distinguishes them from Thiothrix, which are able to use sulfur oxidation as a source of energy.

It combines political, economic, financial, military and industrial espionage. Like other types of espionage, it is subdivided into active and passive espionage. In its original meaning, it applies to human intelligence (HUMINT). It characterizes authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. In the 20th century total espionage was practiced by Japan, Germany and the Soviet Russia. During the Cold War, the Soviet propaganda often accused the United States of total espionage.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000044627.pdf–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤ - –¢–æ—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –®–ø–∏–æ–Ω–∞–∂, –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1984  Kurt Reiss  Total espionage doctrine was first defined by Kurt Riess in his 1941 book Total Espionage: Germany's Information and Disinformation Apparatus 1932-40. German intelligence used Germans residing or travelling abroad, as well as foreign sympathizers, to collect all sorts of information ‚Äì political, scientific, economic, etc. Tourists, scientists, actors, university professors, sailors, auto-mechanics, diplomats, journalists NGO's and business corporations were instrumentalized to gather intelligence and to sabotage the enemy. One important instrument of intelligence gathering was The Organization of Germans Living Abroad, directed by Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, a special assistant to the German Counter-Intelligence (SD) Chief Walter Schellenberg. Vast network of spies was developed by Goebbels' Counter-Action (Abwehr) Department jointly with the War Ministry Intelligence Service.Riess, Kurt-Total Espionage. New York: Putnam's, 1941, p.124. This department was also in charge of controlling German-language newspapers in non-German-speaking countries. According to Riess, \\"by 1937 Goebbels controlled some 330 German newspapers in non-German- speaking countries. This figure did not include the large number of newspapers in Switzerland, Alsace, and Czechoslovakia, nor the newspapers in other languages\\".Riess, Kurt-Total Espionage. New York: Putnam's, 1941, p.126 The goal of this control was not only propaganda, but espionage. Even though Hitler's total espionage was a prerequisite of total war,Stalin and Europe: Imitation and Domination, 1928-1953, Ed. Timothy Snyder and Ray Brandon, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 86 Germany's failure to defeat the Soviet Union quickly was, according to Riess, a result of its inability to build a sound espionage network there.Riess, Kurt-Total Espionage. New York: Putnam's, 1941, p.293-294.  Roger Deacon  Intelligence historian Roger Deacon attributed the invention of total espionage strategy to the pre-Revolutionary Russian secret police, known as the \\"Okhrana\\". \\"Okhrana\\" was created in 1881 following the assassination of Alexander II. According to Deacon, this police agency was \\"the most comprehensive coordinated espionage and counter-espionage organization, the most total form of espionage devised in the latter part of the XIX century and still forming the basis of Soviet espionage and counter- espionage today.\\"Roger Deacon ‚Äì A History of the Russian Secret Service, London, Frederick Muller Ltd., 1972, p.86  Oleg Nechiporenko  In the early 2000s total espionage doctrine resurfaced, due to the efforts of Oleg Nechiporenko, a KGB counter-intelligence operative turned espionage theorist. In his 2001 article \\"Playing on Enemy's Field\\", discussing ancient Chinese spying strategy, Nechiporenko declared: \\"The object of espionage can be anything: there is no person, nor any area or a single phenomenon in the enemy's country that might remain unknown to the opposite side.

In Gerasimov's view, non-military methods could be as efficient if not superior to direct military action. Hybrid warfare doctrine also relied on guerilla war tactics as well as on the concept of asymmetric warfare. Hybrid warfare was used by the Russians during the Crimea annexation and in its war on Donbass. Some of its elements, like faking Western media outlets, are used in the Russian covert campaign against the United States and its allies.

He was born in the Republic of Geneva but moved to France and was naturalized during the French Revolution (1789‚Äì99). He was involved in the Indian cotton trade before founding a banking house in Paris during the Bourbon Restoration. He was politically liberal, supported the July Revolution of 1830 and opposed the seizure of power by Napoleon III in 1851. He favoured protectionist economic policies, and led a lobby group to oppose lowering of tariffs. Family background Antoine Odier's family, which originated in Dauphin√©, was of the ancienne noblesse. An ancestor, also called Antoine Odier, took refuge in Geneva shortly before the end of the 16th century after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The Odiers became related by marriage with patrician families in Geneva, and associated with leading merchants. Antoine Odier's father, Jacques-Antoine Odier, appears to have played an important role in Senn, Bidermann et Cie. This company had been established in 1781 with the purpose of manufacturing Indian cotton at Wesserling, Haut-Rhin, and trading in painted canvasses in three export outlets. When the other leaders of this company moved from Geneva in 1782 to France and Belgium, he was given power of attorney for their affairs in Geneva. Business career Antoine Odier was born on 15 May 1766 in Geneva. He was the son of Jacques- Antoine Odier by his second wife, Marie Cazenove. At a very young age he entered the commercial house of Senn, Bidermann et Cie. Some years before the French Revolution he was given charge of the Ostend outlet, which he transferred to Lorient in 1791 after the suppression of the monopoly of the Compagnie des Indes. Odier became a Frenchman under the law of 1790, which gives this status to the descendants of refugees. He supported the Girondins, and was arrested in 1793. He was not released until the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794. After being released Odier moved to Ostend to look after the company's business, then to Hamburg, where he married Susanne Bou√©, who was like him a descendant of Protestant French refugees. His children were Henriette (b. 1796), Jacques-Antoine (b. 1798), who later became a judge at the court of commerce, a regent of the Bank of France and a member of the Central Council of Reformed Churches, Edouard-Alexandre (b. 1800), who left commerce to become a painter, Alfred-Auguste (b. 1802), Charles-Philippe (b. 1804), C√©cile and Jennny, who both died young and Edmond-Louis (b. 1813). After returning to France he found that maritime commerce was completely ruined by the British Continental System. He devoted himself to developing the national industry, and from this time forward the manufacture of painted canvas was very successful. From 1795 Odier was one of the main directors of the company that took over the Wesserling Indian cotton manufacture under the name \\"Gros, Davillier, Roman et Cie\\", which soon became \\"Gros, Davillier, Odier et Cie\\". In 1803 Antoine Odier and his father were among the ten associates of the firm Gros, Davillier et Cie. Antoine Odier was also involved in companies with his two brothers-in-law, and with important merchants such as Jacques Bidermann of Winterthur. Odier's fortune and influence grew considerably during the Bourbon Restoration. He founded a banking house in Paris. Odier's bank, established during the Bourbon Restoration (1815‚Äì30), was part of the elite group known as the haute banque parisienne. Others established at this time were those of Ardoin fr , Dassier, d‚ÄôEichthal fr, Vernes fr and de Waru fr. Odier's bank survived just two generations. He became a member of the Paris Commercial Court, and then president of that court. He was appointed a censor of the Bank of France, a member of the Supervisory Board of the Sinking Fund and of deposits and consignations, and a member of the Superior Council of Commerce in 1819. La Caricature 1833 Political career During the Bourbon Restoration Odier sat in the Chamber of Deputies of the Departments from 24 November 1827 to 16 May 1830. He represented the Seine department as a member of the liberal opposition. During the July Revolution he voted for the Address of the 221, supported the government and supported the policies of Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Pierre P√©rier. During the July Monarchy he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Seine as a member of the liberal opposition, holding office from 19 July 1830 to 31 May 1831. Odier became a general councilor of the Seine in 1831. He was reelected Deputy for the Seine for the government majority from 5 July 1831 to 25 May 1834, and again from 21 June 1834 to 3 October 1837. The Association pour la d√©fense du Travail national was formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs. The council included Antoine Odier (President), Auguste Mimerel (Vice-President), Joseph P√©rier (Treasurer) and Louis-Martin Lebeuf (Secretary). Members included Henri Barbet, L√©on Talabot and Eug√®ne Schneider. Odier was made a Peer of France on 3 October 1837. He was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honour in 1846. He sat with the government supporters until the French Revolution of 1848. He disagreed with the policies of Napoleon III, and after the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851 he refused to become a member of the Consultative Commission.

The Day of the founding of the German Empire, January 18, became a day of celebration, marking when the Prussian King William I was proclaimed German Emperor in Versailles.  Imperial Proclamation in Versailles  = Background = Proclamation of the Emperor in Versailles (Relief on the base of the Kaiser Wilhelm monument from 1897 in Karlsruhe The question of German Dualism complicated the alliance of German states after the Napoleonic Wars. Would a united Germany include or exclude Austria? According to the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck, any unification was only possible without Austria, since the Habsburg monarchy was, in fact, economically and militarily tied not only to the other German language states but also to the Slavic states of the Balkan peninsula. The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 led to the dissolution of the German Confederation, founded in 1815 after the Prague Treaty. The result was a system of German alliance under the hegemonic domination of Prussia. After the Prussian victory at the Battle of Hradec Kralove, and against the wishes of the Habsburgs, Bismarck succeeded in forming the North German Confederation as a military alliance in August 1866 without Austria. A year later, the North German Confederation made a constitution and became a state. In 1868, Spanish queen Isabella II was dethroned in a military coup (Glorious Revolution). Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, supported by Prussian Prime Minister Bismarck, acted as a candidate for royal succession in Spain. Shortly after his candidature was accepted, however, Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, under the influence of his father, Prince Karl Anton, and the King of Prussia, proposed William I to the throne of Spain because France had threatened war with this candidacy. The Emperor of France, Napoleon III, however, did not want to be satisfied with the simple withdrawal of the candidacy, and sent his ambassador, Vincent Benedetti, to Bad Ems, to enter negotiations with the King of Prussia. Napoleon demanded an official apology from Prussia and the general renouncement of the Hohenzollern and Sigmaringer to the Spanish throne also for the future, which King did not want to accept. (see: Ems Dispatch) \\"But one wanted more: the Prussian government had not yet been revealed, the victory did not yet seem perfect. Benedetti was commissioned to demand William renounce any claim to the throne, and that he would forbid the Sigmaringen family from accepting the Spanish crown.\\"Zit. n.

The French National Assembly granted funds for war, and on 19 July 1870, the French Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Prussia. The southern German states took the side of Prussia in accordance with their defensive alliances.Lothar Gall, 1871 ‚Äì Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte. Ausstellungskatalog, Bonn 1971, S. 128. Victories in August and September 1870, over the French armies led to the willingness of the Southern German princes to join the North German Confederation. On 9 and 10 December 1870, the Reichstag voted to offer the Emperor's title to the Prussian king. In addition, the country was to be renamed \\"German Reich\\". This became effective on 1 January 1871 with a new constitution. As a day for the imperial proclamation to take place, 18 January was chosen to coincide with the royal coronation of Frederick III von Brandenburg's coronation of Frederick I in 1701, which led to the founding of the Kingdom of Prussia.

While Wilhelm I emphasised the religious nature of the ceremony, Bismarck encountered the political content of the because he was said to have preferred an actual mood of religious retreat to the pose to victory. Bismarck, surprisingly, openly criticised the Emperor's behaviour; the emperor did not view himself as holding authority over the princes but rather saw himself as a master of war who triumphed with his faithfuls. Wilhelm spontaneously brought the princes to the same level. In Pfister's description, the religious focus of the ceremony which Wilhelm and Bismarck emphasised. He emphasised, on the other hand, the polarising public effect. The three reports appear more authentically than later portrayals, especially the portrayals in source edits and school book presentations between 1918 and 1945, all of which were created under the dominating impression of the shocking defeat of the \\"Bismarck empire\\" in the First World War.

He was known to be a childhood friend of alleged Soviet spy Alger Hiss. Background Harvard Law School, where Marbury studied in the early 1920s William L. Marbury Jr. was born on September 12, 1901, in Baltimore. He grew up in the family home on Bolton Hill, Baltimore. His father was William Luke Marbury Sr. (1858‚Äì1935); his mother Silvine von Dorsner (Slingluff) Marbury (1867‚Äì1948). Marbury Sr.'s family were slave-holding plantation owners in Southern Maryland before he came to Baltimore in the 1870s. Marbury Sr. was a eugenicist who helped draft a plan to disenfranchise African-Americans. In 1915, he argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that states had separate rights to discriminate if they chose. Formerly U.S. Attorney General for Maryland (1894-1898), Marbury Sr. became president of the board of managers at Maryland's \\"Hospital for the 'Negro' Insane\\" (now Crownsville Hospital Center (1910-1935) and wrote a Segregation Ordinance. William Marbury (1790s) He is a distant relative of William Marbury (1762‚Äì1835), 18th-Century American businessman and one of the \\"Midnight Judges\\" appointed by U.S. President John Adams the day before he left office. He was plaintiff in the landmark 1803 Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison. This ancestor came from Piscataway, Maryland; nearby is Marbury, Maryland. Marbury Jr. attended the Boy's Latin and Episcopal High Schools and the Virginia Military Institute. In 1921, he graduated from the University of Virginia. In 1924, he graduated from Harvard Law School after serving on the school's law review. While at Harvard, he served as editor of the Harvard Law Review (as later did his friend and protegee, Alger Hiss) and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. In November 5, 1923, he gave a speech on the \\"practical side of the professional and the ideals.\\" In 1925, he passed the Maryland Bar. Private practice In 1925, Marbury joined his father's firm, then called Marbury Miller & Evans. He worked there until his death in 1988 in a career that spanned more than 60 years. In 1937, he defended the constitutionality of Baltimore County‚Äôs denial of a high school education to a colored child. In 1948, the Board of Overseers of Harvard University elected him as Fellow of the Harvard Corporation. The vote for his election was narrow, as Marbury was \\"virtually unknown\\" to Corporation members ‚Äì except for Harvard University President Conant and fellow Grenville Clark, both of whom supported his election strongly. In 1965, he became a senior fellow. In 1970, he retired from the board. In 1952, he merged the family firm of Marbury, Miller & Evans with Piper, Watkins, Avirett & Egerton to create Piper & Marbury. In 1999, Piper & Marbury merged with Rudnick & Wolfe of Chicago to form Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, then \\"the largest U.S. law firm merger in history.\\" In 2002, Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, LLP, dropped \\"Marbury\\" from its name. (The firm had many prominent 20th-century lawyers, including: Carol T. Bond, R. Dorsey Watkins, Robert B. Watts Sr., and Milton B. Allen, Joseph G. Finnerty Jr.) In 1957, he became general counsel of the Maryland Port Authority and remained so until 1967. In 1964, Marbury was among \\"fifty of the country's most prominent lawyers\\" who joined a public statement that rebuked U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater for attacks he made on the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1966, he tried but failed to \\"censure\\" key provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1965, he served one year as president of the Maryland State Bar Association (as his father William L. Marbury Sr. had done in 1910). He organized the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau. He was also one of the original members of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law under U.S. President John F. Kennedy, to aid civil rights cases. Government service US Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson congratulating Colonel Chauncey M. Hooper in Hawaii under whom Marbury served In 1930, Marbury served for a year as assistant attorney general for Maryland. In 1940, Marbury served under Judge Robert P. Patterson for a year as expert consultant on procurement to U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. In 1942, he served three years as chief legal advisor on procurements for the U.S. Army Air Corps at the U.S. Department of War). In June 1945, George L. Harrison brought in two Harvard Law School-trained War Department lawyers, Brigadier General Kenneth Royall and Marbury to draft the May‚ÄìJohnson Bill, which passed into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. In September 1945, Marbury left wartime government service to resume private law practice in Baltimore. In 1948, he served as a U.S. delegate to the second session of signatories of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva, Switzerland. On August 8, 1948, he received instructions to attend that meeting and did not return until September 12. In 1971, he became a member of the Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities, where he served until 1983. Hiss case Alger Hiss (1950), Marbury's friend from childhood Alger Hiss's sat one pew in front of the Marbury family at its Episcopalian church in Baltimore. One of Marbury's sisters worked at the Johns Hopkins University library while Hiss studied there. His cousin Jesse Slingluff Jr. was a fraternity brother with Hiss in Alpha Delta Phi, as was his wife's brother, Hugh Judge Jewett Jr. (who was in Hiss' class). By 1929, they had become \\"close personal friends\\" as adults. Both attended each other's weddings; Hiss was godfather to one of Marbury's children. Marbury was involved in the Hiss case in its hearings, trials, and aftermath for the rest of his life, with a detailed legal essay coming out in 1981 and a memoir around his death in 1988. On August 3, 1948, senior Time editor Whittaker Chambers, under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), mentioned Hiss as a member of the Ware Group, a spy ring that Chambers had run in Washington during the 1930s. On August 5, 1948, Marbury took Hiss to the offices of Covington & Burling, where Hiss's brother, Donald Hiss, worked for a meeting with Hiss's classmate Marbury's friend Joe Johnson, helped Hiss to prepare his statement, and then \\"accompanied\\" (i.e., not formally as \\"counsel\\") Hiss before HUAC. Thereafter, he left the U.S. for three weeks in Europe on government business. In the \\"three-ring circus\\" of HUAC hearings in Washington, libel lawsuit in Baltimore, and Grand Jury investigation in New York during 1948, Marbury led the Hiss defense team in the libel suit against William D. Macmillan Sr. of Semmes, Bowen & Semmes, who defended Chambers. As Marbury summarized the situation: > It seemed to me inevitable that if he [Hiss] failed to sue Chambers, his > reputation would be so irretrievably destroyed that the Endowment would have > to dispense with his services anyhow.... I warned both Alger and Priscilla > that if there were any skeletons in the closet of either one of them, they > would certainly be discovered if suit were filed, and they both assured me > there was no cause for worry on that count.... I again warned about > skeletons in the closet and mentioned the case of Oscar Wilde, but Alger > brushed this aside, saying that he had nothing to hide. While Marbury was in Europe, Hiss worked with numerous lawyers led by Ed McLean of Debevoise, Plimpton & McLean in New York. While McLean feared that a libel case would come to court too slowly in New York, Marbury argued that Hiss could file in Chambers' home state of Maryland through a Federal Court in Baltimore, if they acted within 60 days. Hiss switched out McLean for Marbury as lead counsel and filed the libel suit on September 27, 1948. During pre- trial proceedings, he recalled, \\"I made demand on him to produce anything whatsoever which he had in his possession in the way of written evidence which would substantiate his story, and particularly any communications from Alger or Priscilla Hiss.\\" Chambers brought forward the \\"Baltimore Documents\\" that included papers handwritten by Hiss and typed on the Hiss family typewriter. Marbury recalled, \\"I was shocked when I recognized what seemed to be Alger's handwriting.... I was fully aware of the devastating effect that these memoranda would be certain to have on Alger's suit.\\" Nevertheless, Hiss had Marbury send the papers to the U.S. Department of Justice, clearly expecting it to indict Chambers. Instead, after days of intense grand jury hearings, the Department of Justice indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury on December 15, 1948. The libel suit stalled. When Hiss was convicted of both counts of perjury in January 1950, the libel suit disappeared. (Hiss maintained his innocence until his death, in 1996.) Years later, Marbury was critical of Hiss. After reviewing his HUAC testimony, he noted: > There was no doubt that in his appearances before the Committee in my > absence Alger had handled himself very badly. He had adopted a rather > arrogant attitude and had repeatedly fenced with the members of the > Committee. He had written a letter to the Chairman which reeked with hurt > pride and indignation, and had grudgingly admitted association with Chambers > under the name of George Crosley, but only after examining his teeth and > asking him to read aloud some passages from a document. Personal and death Peabody Institute, prep school in East Mount Vernon Place (1902), which Marbury served (1935‚Äì67) On December 3, 1935, Marbury married Natalie Ingraham Jewett (a Bryn Mawr alumna) previously married to Charles Yandes Wheeler, who had died in 1933 in a car accident; she died on November 18, 1993). They had two daughters, a son, and a stepson: Anne M. Wyatt-Brown, Susan M. Briscoe, Luke Marbury (of Venable, Baetjer and Howard, whose son is grandson Hugh Marbury of DLA Piper) and Charles Yandes Wheeler . Marbury associated with the Peabody Institute of Baltimore most of his life. He served as trustee (1935-1967), as president (1948-1957), and chairman (1957-1967). He also served as a member of: * Advisory board, Center for Advanced Studies, University Virginia (1971-1978) * Fellow, American Bar Foundation (50-Year award 1984) * Maryland Bar Foundation (chairman 1973-1975) * American College Trial Lawyers * American Academy of Arts and Sciences * National Institute of Trial Advocacy (director 1971-1976) * American Law Institute (member council 1946-1980) * Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education Lawyers (president 1976-1978, trustee 1976-1981) * American Judicature Society (director 1939-1941, Herbert Harley award 1981) * American Bar Association (member committee judicial conduct 1969) * Baltimore Bar Association In 1952, the Harvard Crimson noted that Whittaker Chambers had written in the Saturday Evening Post (which was serializing his memoir, Witness) that \\"Marbury, a prominent Baltimore lawyer, supported Hiss because the charges against Hiss represented an attack against 'the island of caste'.\\" Marbury died age 86 on March 5, 1988, at his home in Baltimore. Awards * 1945: Presidential Medal for Merit (from U.S. President Harry S. Truman) * 1970: Honorary Law Degree from Harvard University Legacy In addition to his writings, Marbury left many of his papers to the Maryland Historical Society. In 1987, the Harvard Corporation's president, Nathan M. Pusey, called Marbury \\"one of the great heroes of the Corporation.\\" Shortly after his death 1988, the Maryland Legal Services Corporation named a \\"William L. Marbury Outstanding Advocate Award.\\" In 2005, the Johns Hopkins University dedicated the offices of DLA Piper to the Marbury's memory. DLA Piper established a \\"Marbury Institute\\" to train lawyers in house.

It lies to the south-west of the city centre and to the north of Badger Farm, and makes up a large percentage, in both area and population, of the St. Luke electoral ward. It is home to roughly 6,000 inhabitants. History Historically the area was known as Stanmer Weye, before construction of the estate started in 1920. An official opening by Edward VIII, then the Prince of Wales, was carried out in 1923. Description Stanmore is a typical early 1900s housing estate, with medium-sized red brick houses and numerous green spaces, however there are also a number of newer developments, especially around the area informally known as Lower Stanmore. The Right to Buy scheme has enabled a large number of properties in Stanmore to come into private ownership, and this has seen the student population increase significantly. This is also due to Stanmore's close proximity to the University of Winchester. Amenities The suburb formerly had two pubs, 'The Stanmore Hotel' (closed 2009) and 'New Queens Head' (closed 2012), with the former becoming a care home, and the latter being redeveloped into social housing. There are two local retail areas in Stanmore, in Wavell Way and Cromwell Road respectively. There is also a community centre on Somers Close. On the same site the Carroll Centre operates a nursery, after school club, mother and tots group and a soft play area with a cafe. 'Party in the Park', a community event with stalls and entertainment, is held annually in the summer. Religion Stanmore is home to three religious institutions, St Luke's Church of the Church of England on Mildmay Street, and Level10 Church on Stanmore Lane, in the building formerly occupied by Winchester Family Church. The third is St Stephens Catholic Church, situated on the same site as the local Catholic primary school, St Peters, on Oliver's Battery Road North.

Constituted in 1939 and organized in 1940 and 1941, the one-battalion regiment remained in Alaska during World War II, and became a separate infantry battalion in 1944. The 297th was reconstituted in 1959 with two battalions and a battle group, which later became a third battalion. In 1972, it was split into the 297th Infantry and the 297th Cavalry but both units merged as the 297th Infantry in 1976. The regiment's 3rd Battalion deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom between 2006 and 2007, and in 2009 it became the 297th Cavalry with 1st Squadron. In 2016, the 297th Cavalry became an infantry unit again.  History  = Formation and World War II = The 297th Infantry Regiment (Separate) was originally constituted as the first unit of the Alaska National Guard on 21 October 1939. The four companies were organized and Federally recognized during 1940: Company A on 21 September at Juneau, Company B on 17 September at Ketchikan, Company C on 10 October at Fairbanks and Company D on 4 October at Anchorage. The 1st Battalion, including a headquarters and the four previously formed companies, was organized and Federally recognized on 11 January 1941 with headquarters at Juneau. It was commanded by Major Charles G. Burdick from 11 January to 27 June. On 15 September, the 1st Battalion was inducted into Federal service and moved to Fort Richardson for duty, where it arrived around 30 September. Meanwhile, A and B Companies were transferred to Chilkoot Barracks near Haines. The battalion was assigned to the Alaska Defense Command. On 26 January 1944, it was redesignated as the 208th Infantry Battalion (Separate). On 24 February 1945, the battalion arrived in the continental United States at the Seattle Port of Embarkation. On 14 April it was assigned to the Replacement and School Command. The 208th was inactivated at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, on 16 May 1945. = Postwar = On 15 March 1949, the 207th Infantry Battalion, Separate, was constituted and allotted to the Alaska National Guard. It was organized and Federally recognized on 25 January 1950 with headquarters, headquarters and service company at Anchorage. On 12 July, the 208th Infantry Battalion, Separate, was reactivated, covering southeastern Alaska with headquarters at Juneau. On 1 October 1953, the 208th dropped the \\"Separate\\" designation. On 1 February 1959, the 207th and 208th were consolidated with the 1st and 2nd Scout Battalions to form the 297th Infantry, a Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) parent regiment. The 207th became the 3rd Battle Group of the 297th Infantry, which also included the 1st and 2nd Scout Battalions. The 3rd Battle Group was redesignated as the regiment's 3rd Battalion on 20 January 1964. On 1 May 1972, the 3rd Battalion was converted and redesignated as the 297th Cavalry, a CARS parent regiment that included the 5th Squadron. The squadron's elements were redesignated from 3rd Battalion units: Headquarters and Headquarters Troop was redesignated from the 3rd Battalion's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Troop A from Company A at Ketchikan, Detachment 1 of Troop A from Detachment 1 of Company A at Sitka, Detachment 2 of Troop A from Detachment 2 of Company A at Kodiak, Troop B from Company B at Anchorage, Detachment 1 of Troop B from Detachment 1 of Company B at Kenai and Soldotna, Detachment 2 of Troop B from Detachment 2 of Company B at Seward, and Company C from the 216th Transportation Company at Fairbanks. The 297th Infantry remained active with the 1st and 2nd Scout Battalions. On 1 October 1976, the 297th Cavalry was broken up and converted into 5th Battalion, 297th Infantry. Troop A became Company C, Troop B became Company A, Detachment 2 of Troop B was consolidated with Detachment 1 of the same troop to become Detachment 1 of Company A, and Troop C became Company B. The reunited 297th Infantry also included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions. A 4th Battalion was activated on 1 November 1978. In 1988 the 1st Battalion was at Nome, the 2nd Battalion at Bethel, the 3rd Battalion at Kotzebue, the 4th Battalion at Juneau, and the 5th Battalion at Anchorage. On 1 May 1989, the 297th was withdrawn from CARS and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System (USARS). It was reorganized to add the 6th Battalion (Light) at Juneau on 1 September of that year, which was assigned on the same date to the Fort Richardson-based 1st Brigade, 6th Infantry Division (Light) as a roundout unit. The 6th Battalion was formed from the existing 4th Battalion units, and a new 4th Battalion organized in western Alaska. The 4th Battalion was inactivated on 30 September 1992, and 3rd and 5th Battalions followed on 1 September 1994. A year later, the 6th Battalion was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion. = 21st century = Palin visiting soldiers of the 3rd Battalion at Camp Buehring, July 2007 The unit was redesignated the 297th Infantry Regiment on 1 October 2005. On 6 July 2006, the 297th's 3rd Battalion was ordered into active Federal service at home stations. During predeployment training at Camp Shelby, two soldiers of the battalion were killed (SFC George W. Dauma and SSG William F. Brown) and two other soldiers were seriously wounded in a 20 July accident on U.S. Route 98. In the largest Alaska National Guard deployment since World War II, the unit provided security in Kuwait and Iraq in support of Third Army, and did not suffer casualties during its deployment. It was stationed at Camp Buehring, Camp Virginia, and Camp Navistar. In July 2007, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin visited the unit in Kuwait. The 3rd Battalion returned to Camp Shelby in October, and was released from active Federal service 1 January 2008, reverting to state control. On 1 September 2009, the regiment was converted into the 297th Cavalry Regiment, consisting of the 1st Squadron, headquartered at Fairbanks.

It was the one of the few, if not the only, indigenous Roman Catholic polities in the territory of modern Indonesia. Acting as a tributary state of the Portuguese Crown, the Raja (King) of Larantuka controlled holdings on the islands of Flores, Solor, Adonara and Lembata. It was later purchased by Dutch East Indies from the Portuguese, prior to its annexation in 1904. Despite losing its effective sovereignty after the annexation, the Kingdom's royal family persisted as traditional figureheads prior to the final abolition of the royal structure by republican authorities in 1962. History Monarchs of the Larantuka Kingdom claim descent from a union between a man from the Kingdom of Manuaman Lakaan Fialaran or Wehale Waiwuku in South Timor and a mythical woman from a nearby extinct volcano of Ile Mandiri. Traditional belief systems and rituals of the Lamaholot people who were their subjects place the rajas in a central role, especially for those who adhered to traditional beliefs. In the Javanese Negarakertagama, the locations Galiyao and Solot were mentioned to be \\"east of Bali\\" and are believed to correspond to the approximate region, indicating some form of contact from tributary relations or trading between the region and the Majapahit Empire, due to its location in the trade routes carrying sandalwood from nearby Timor. Influences from the powerful Ternate Sultanate were also believed to be present. Crown Prince Lorenzo II of Larantuka, aged 12. Drawing of a photograph taken 1871 in Surabaya. Western presence in the region started with the Portuguese, who captured Malacca in 1511. As they began trading for the sandalwood at Timor, their presence in the region increased. Solor was described by Tom√© Pires in his Suma Oriental, although some scholars believe he was referring to nearby larger Flores, mentioning the abundance of exported sulphur and foodstuffs. By 1515, there was trade between both Flores and Solor with the foreigners, and by 1520 a small Portuguese settlement has been constructed in Lifau, at Solor. The trade-in sandalwood also attracted Chinese and Dutch along with nearer Makassarese, creating competition. The Makassarese attacked and captured Larantuka in 1541 to extend their control over the sandalwood trade and in 1613, the Dutch destroyed the Portuguese base at Solor before establishing themselves at modern Kupang. The first Raja to be baptized was Ola Adobala who was brought up under Portuguese education, traditionally the ninth in the pedigree of the Rajas and baptized during the reign of Peter II of Portugal while present-day traditional celebrations place his baptism at 1650 instead. In addition, Portuguese sources mention a Dom Constantino between 1625-1661, which implies that Adobala may not be the first in the line of Catholic monarchs of Larantuka. Other monarch names mentioned are Dom Luis (1675) and Dom Domingos Viera (1702) The Dominican Order was vital in the spread of Catholicism in the area until their later replacement in the 19th century. The polity maintained some form of a closed-port policy for outsiders in the late 17th century. There were also some interactions with the nearby Bima Sultanate, whose Sultan enforced his suzerainty over parts of Western Flores in 1685. Territories of the kingdom were not contiguous and was interspersed by the holdings of several lesser polities, some of which were Muslim. By 1851, debts incurred by the Portuguese colony in East Timor motivated the Portuguese authorities to \\"sell\\" territories covered by Larantuka to the Dutch East Indies, and the transfer was made by 1859 ceding the Portuguese claim/suzerainty over parts of Flores and the island range stretching from Alor to Solor for 200,000 florins and some Dutch holdings in Timor. The treaty also confirmed that the Catholic inhabitants of the region will remain so under the authority of Protestant Netherlands, and the Dutch authorities sent Jesuit priests to the area. On 14 September 1887, a new Raja Don Lorenzo Diaz Vieria Godinho ascended to the throne as Lorenzo II, who was educated by Jesuit priests. Showing clear traits of independence, he attempted to extract taxes from territories belonging to a nearby Raja of Sikka, led groups of men to intervene in local conflicts, and refused to conduct sacrifices in the manner his predecessors did for the non-Catholic natives. Eventually, colonial authorities responded by deposing and exiling him to Java in 1904, where he died six years later. The royal family remained post- Indonesian independence as traditional figureheads with no legal authority until their final abolishment on 1962. Legacy Cathedral of the Queen of the Rosary in Larantuka, built during the times of the kingdom. In present-day Indonesia, unique Catholic traditions close to Easter days remain, locally known as the Semana Santa. It involves a procession carrying statues of Jesus and Virgin Mary (locally referred to as Tuan Ana and Tuan Ma) to a local beach, then to Cathedral of the Queen of the Rosary, the seat of the bishop. The raja title is still held by descendants of the past kings (most recently by Don Andre III Marthinus DVG on 2016), although it is not associated with any secular authority. The residence (istana) of the king still stands to this day. According to the 2010 census, the majority of the population in the kingdom's former territories, and the East Nusa Tenggara province as a whole, remained Catholics.

The campaign followed a series of failed attempts to reclaim the island from the Muslims stretching as far back as 827, only a few years after the initial conquest of the island by the Arabs, and was led by the general and future emperor Nikephoros Phokas. It lasted from autumn 960 until spring 961, when the main Muslim fortress and capital of the island, Chandax (modern Heraklion) was captured. The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.  Crete under Muslim rule  The island of Crete had been conquered in the late 820s by a large group of exiles from Muslim Spain. In the years after the initial landing, the Byzantine Empire launched repeated expeditions to drive them back and recover the island, but these were defeated. The Saracens established their stronghold of Chandax on the northern coast, which became the capital of the new Emirate of Crete. The Muslim occupation of Crete had devastating consequences for Byzantium, as it opened up its naval heartland, the Aegean Sea, to raids from the Muslim fleets, both by the Cretan Saracens themselves, as well as those of the Levant, that used Crete as a forward base or a stop-over, as seen during Leo of Tripoli's sack of Thessalonica in 904, when many of the over 20,000 Thessalonian captives were sold or gifted as slaves in Crete. The first major attempt by the Byzantines to reclaim the island was in 842‚Äì843, under Theoktistos. It made some headway, and apparently allowed for the re-establishment of the recovered parts of the island as a theme, as evidenced by the presence of a strategos of Crete in the contemporary Taktikon Uspensky. However Theoktistos had to abandon the campaign, and the troops left behind were quickly defeated by the Saracens. In the spring of 866, the regent Bardas intended to launch a campaign to recover Crete, but was assassinated on the eve of its departure. Further Byzantine attempts at reconquest in 911 (177 ships under the admiral Himerios) and 949 (128 ships under Constantine Gongyles) failed disastrously, despite the large resources and forces mustered. According to Christos Makrypoulias, despite their often meticulous preparation, the Byzantine expeditions against Crete failed due to supply constraints and the strategy of attrition followed by the Cretan Saracens. Success or failure in controlling Crete ultimately relied on control of Chandax, which left the Byzantines in the precarious position of having to maintain a siege for longer periods far from their supply bases. Secure behind the ramparts of Chandax, the Saracens could wait until their opponents had become weakened enough to launch a devastating counterattack. Determined to avenge the disaster of 949, towards the end of his reign Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (, 945‚Äì959) renewed preparations for capturing the island. Following his death in 959, the task fell upon his son and successor, Romanos II (). With the support and urging of his chief minister, Joseph Bringas, Romanos pushed on and appointed the Domestic of the Schools of the East, Nikephoros Phokas, a capable soldier and a distinguished veteran of the wars against the Muslims in eastern Asia Minor, as the commander-in-chief of the expedition. Phokas mobilized the Byzantine army of Asia Minor, and assembled a large force south of Ephesus. This expedition was far larger than previous ones, chiefly due to the relative internal stability brought on by recent victories on the eastern frontiers and a longstanding peace with the Bulgarians. According to Leo the Deacon, the fleet comprised many dromons equipped with Greek fire.  Historical sources  Modern scholars rely primarily on three near-contemporary sources for the events surrounding the Byzantine reconquest of Crete: the history of Leo the Deacon, the poem The Capture of Crete of Theodosios the Deacon, and the continuation to the chronicle of Symeon the Logothete. The otherwise unknown Theodosios the Deacon wrote his poem in 961/962, as a panegyric to the recapture of the island, and presented it to Nikephoros Phokas shortly before his ascent to the imperial throne in 963. Leo the Deacon, who was born , completed his history after 992, and is a major Byzantine source on the period 959‚Äì975, including many anecdotes and eyewitness accounts. Although soon forgotten among the Byzantines themselves, it served as a source for later historians like John Skylitzes and John Zonaras. the first two chapters of his work deal with the reconquest of Crete. Symeon the Logothetes wrote during Nikephoros Phokas' reign (963‚Äì969), and is sometimes identified with Symeon the Metaphrast, or with another Symeon who held a succession of offices under Phokas and John I Tzimiskes (). His work reaches until 948, and the continuation, possibly written by Symeon himself, reaches to 963. It does not survive in its original form, but in two variants: one as the sixth and last book of the Theophanes Continuatus, that deals with the reign of Constantine VII and Romanos II up to the spring of 961, and a summarized version up to 962 as part of the chronicle of Pseudo-Symeon. However, as the historian Anthony Kaldellis points out, a large part of the account of Symeon, which is heavily relied on by modern scholarship, is lifted, often almost verbatim, from the similar account by Procopius of Caesarea on the expedition of Belisarius against the Vandalic Kingdom.  Landing in Crete and first clashes  Using ramps, the expeditionary force swiftly disembarked in good order. Theophanes Continuatus and Theodosios the Deacon report that the Byzantines faced no resistance at disembarkation, but Leo the Deacon reports that the Saracens were awaiting the Byzantine landing arrayed for battle. Nikephoros quickly mustered his troops in the typical Byzantine battle formation in three sections, and charged the Saracen army. The Saracens broke under the Byzantine attack, and turned to flee in the fortifications of Chandax, suffering many casualties. Leo the Deacon describes the city as being strongly fortified both by nature and by artifice: From Leo and Theodosios' account it appears that Nikephoros initially hoped to capture Chandax by storm, but when this failed, he settled for a long-term siege, constructing a fortified encampment in front of Chandax, and placing his fleet in a secure anchorage nearby with orders to blockade the city and destroy any ships that might try to leave it. According to Leo, Phokas then instructed Nikephoros Pastilas, the strategos of the Thracesian Theme and a distinguished veteran of the wars against the Arabs in the east, to take a \\"cohort of picked men\\" and undertake a raid into the Cretan countryside to scout out the situation and gather supplies. Perceiving the countryside to be relatively safe, Pastilas and his men roamed carelessly, indulging on food and wine. The Muslims, who were carefully hidden and observed their progress from the heights, saw this as an excellent opportunity, and assembled for battle. Leo maintains that although drunk, the Byzantines put up a good fight, until Pastilas himself, after being wounded by many arrows, fell. Then the Byzantines' discipline collapsed, and they were cut down, with only a few men surviving to report of the disaster to Phokas.  Siege of Chandax  After hearing of the news of his slaughtered battalion, Phokas resolved to move quickly and establish a firm siege of the city. He inspected the city wall and found it to be extremely strong. As a result he ordered his men to begin constructing a circumvallation from coast to coast in front of the landward side of the city wall. However, Pastilas' misfortune also demonstrated to Phokas that he would have to secure his rear before focusing on the siege. He selected a small group of younger soldiers, and led them out of the camp at night in secret. The Byzantines took a few prisoners, from whom they learned that a relief force, according to Leo some 40,000 men, were assembling on a nearby hill to attack the Byzantine encampment. Phokas allowed his men to rest during the next day, and only set off again when evening had fallen, guided by locals (probably native Christians). Quickly and quietly, his men surrounded the Arab encampment. Phokas then ordered the trumpets blown and charged the sleeping Arabs. Taken by surprise, the latter gave no thought to resisting, but tried to flee, only to run into other Byzantine troops. The Arab relief army was annihilated, and Phokas instructed his men to cut off the heads of the fallen and take them with them as they returned to their base, again moving only during the night. On the next day, he had his men impale some of the heads in view of the city wall, and hurled others with catapults into the city itself. The sight caused great consternation and lamentation among the inhabitants, who saw their kin and friends dead; but they remained determined to resist, and threw back an attack led by Phokas soon after. Phokas employed archers and throwing machines against the defenders while attempting to scale the wall using ladders. The fortress held, however, under the pressure of the bombardments, and the ladders were crushed. Phokas soon called off the siege. He now decided to blockade the city for the winter while his engineers began to design and construct more significant siege engines. It was around this point that the Emir of Crete, Abd al-Aziz, appealed to many of his fellow Muslim rulers for aid. Their envoys first went to the Ikhshidid ruler of Egypt, Unujur ibn al- Ikhshid, but he showed little inclination to come to their aid. As a result, the Cretans turned to the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah, although he was a heterodox and bitter rival of the Cretans' nominal suzerain, the Abbasid caliph. For al-Mu'izz, this was a golden opportunity to portray himself as the true champion of jihad in the eyes of the Islamic world. He wrote letters to Romanos demanding that his forces leave Crete, otherwise the truce signed between them in 958 would be ended; and to Unujur suggesting a common effort against the Byzantines by uniting their fleets on 20 May 961 at Tolmeita in the Cyrenaica. Even if the Ikhshidid fleet did not come, declared al-Mu'izz, he would sail alone to aid Crete. In the event, nothing came of this as the Byzantines conquered Chandax even before the Fatimid fleet was made ready to sail. The second assault on Chandax took place in March 961. This time the Byzantines used much more effective siege machines against Chandax, but they were still unable to gain a foothold in the city. Meanwhile, the Muslims kept just out of range of the Greek archers so that they could still attend the walls but not be annihilated by the bombardment. Phokas soon employed the use of a battering ram on the walls, but this was a feint. While the Muslims were focusing on the battering ram, miners dug underneath the walls and planted explosive and flammable materials underneath the weak points. Soon, they managed to destroy a huge section of the wall, where the Byzantine army began to pour into the city. The defenders quickly formed a line within the city, but it was too late. On 6 March, the Muslims were routed and fled back into the streets. The soldiers were allowed the traditional three days of plunder before the army again set off.  Aftermath  With the capture of Chandax, the rest of Crete quickly capitulated to the Byzantine army, and the island was brought back under the suzerainty of Constantinople, and a long-term effort was made by Byzantium to re-Christianize the island. The island was organized as a regular theme, with a strategos based at Chandax. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \\"the Metanoeite\\". Lying on the southern entry of the Aegean Sea, the conquest of Crete was especially beneficial to the Byzantines due to its strategic position for the purpose of launching raids onto the coast of North Africa. On the other hand, the commitment of so many Byzantine forces to Crete and the East left the way open for the Fatimids' own designs on the Byzantine possessions in the west: Fatimid forces proceeded to capture Taormina, the chief Byzanine fortress on Sicily, followed by a long siege of Rometta, the last Byzantine stronghold in the Val Demone. Nikephoros Phokas, who became emperor in 963, sent a huge relief expedition to the island in 964, including many veterans of the conquest of Crete. However, the Byzantines were defeated before Rometta and their fleet destroyed, signalling the completion of the Muslim conquest of Sicily.

The event was held on the same day as other demonstrations throughout the city, including the Juggalo March. Speakers included Marco Gutierrez and the leaders of Gays for Trump and Patriot Prayer, among others. Members of the 3 Percenters, American Guard, Oath Keepers, and Proud Boys were present, as were Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists. Crowd estimates ranged from several hundred to around 1,000 attendees, far less than organizers' original goal of 1 million participants and claims that thousands would attend. No Republican elected officials attended the rally. Planning Tommy Hodges (also known as Tommy Gunn) was one of the rally's organizers. The event was billed as \\"not a left or right rally\\", and according to The New York Times, was named after the GBU-43/B MOAB, commonly known as the \\"Mother of All Bombs\\". Organizers planned to ask attendees with Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism, or hateful signage, to leave or return such belongings to their vehicles. They had a goal of one million participants, and claimed thousands would attend. Leading up to the event, Boykin told The Washington Post he planned to condemn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Sharia, and transgender people in military service in his speech. According to The Independent, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia expected 1,800 people to attend. The Mother of All Rallies took place on the same day as more than 30 other events held on federal land in Washington, D.C., including a march organized by fans of the hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse that was known as the Juggalo March, a small anti-Trump demonstration near the White House, and a protest against white supremacism. Participants and activities Speaker at the event Speakers included Peter Boykin of Gays for Trump, Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson, Tim Foley of the Arizona Border Recon militia group, Marco Gutierrez of Latinos for Trump, author Hamody Jasim, and Omar Navarro. They reportedly endorsed Trump's Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, which prohibits open military service of transgender individuals, and spoke out against sanctuary cities. Crowd estimates ranged from several hundred to around 1,000 people. The Associated Press reported there were 500 people assembled near the Washington Monument by 1:30pm, and one rally organizer taunted members of the media by inviting them to the stage to film but saying, \\"I know you don't like to show large pro- Trump crowds\\". One speaker got attendees to chant \\"lock her up\\" in reference to Hillary Clinton, which was often heard at Trump events leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Members of the 3 Percenters, American Guard, Oath Keepers, and Proud Boys were present, as was the Trump Unity Bridge. A group of Antifa demonstrators briefly visited the rally; the group was reportedly confronted by regional militia members at the Mother of All Rallies but tensions were reduced by United States Park Police officers. When Black Lives Matter activists gathered near the stage, a Mother of All Rallies organizer invited them to speak from the stage, and said: \\"It's your right to say whatever you believe, and it's their [the crowd's] right to let you know what they think about what you're saying. The important thing is that everybody has a right to speak their mind.\\" Participants heard the Pledge of Allegiance each hour, and many versions of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". No Republican members of Congress or politicians attended the rally. Reception The Trump Unity Bridge at the rally British newspaper Metro called the rally the \\"mother of all failures\\". The New York Times Emily Baumgaertner said the numerous demonstrations throughout Washington, D.C. \\"seemed a potentially combustible mix, but clashes were limited to a few harsh words exchanged near some porta-potties, and the city went about its usual business\\". In his comparison of the Juggalo March and the March of All Rallies, Adam Gabbatt of The Guardian wrote: \\"The upbeat, open-minded nature of the Juggalo march, in spite of the reason for it taking place, provided a stark contrast to the Trump event, where people waved anti-communism flags and talked variously about Hillary Clinton's emails, the need to 'take our country back', and craven politicians. The only palpable similarities between the events was that both took place on the national mall and both offered free face-painting ‚Äì although the stars and stripes designs at the Trump rally differed in style from those of the Insane Clown Posse crowd.\\" References External links * Category:2017 in American politics Category:2017 in Washington, D.C.

It was built in place of the ancient Sƒìlpils hillfort (), a military and political center of ancient Selonia, a land of the Balts. When the Livonian Order entered the land, they built a stone castle known as Selburg in German. Today, the village of Vecsƒìlpils (\\"old Sƒìlpils\\") is located nearby. The ruins of the hillfort were on the left bank of Daugava near Vecsƒìlpils.

Used as a base for raids by the Selonians and their Lithuanian allies into Latgalian and Livonian lands, Sƒìlpils was first mentioned in the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, which describes its capture by the Livonian Order and their Christianized ethnic Livonian allies in 1208. Sƒìlpils was briefly the seat of a Selonian diocese (1218‚Äì1226), and then came under the rule of the Livonian Order, which constructed fortifications there for the Advocate () of the Order. These were destroyed by the Swedes in 1704, during the Great Northern War, and only traces of the foundations are visible at the site today. Since the early 17th century, the ancient city of Sƒìlpils also existed.Das Inland : eine Wochenschrift f√ºr Liv-, Esth- und Curl√§ndische Geschichte, Geographie, Statistik und Litteratur.

These converters refined a matte with 36% Ni+Cu, in a matte containing 80% Ni+Cu. The Manh√®s‚ÄìDavid process is a refining process of the copper mattes, invented in 1880 by the French industrialist Pierre Manh√®s and his engineer . Inspired by the Bessemer process, it consists of the use of a converter to oxidise with air the undesirable chemical elements (mainly iron and sulfur) contained in the matte, to transform it into copper. The quantity of the elements to be oxidized, as well as the low heat produced by the chemical reactions, lead to drastics modifications of the converter. Manh√®s and David designed it as a horizontal cylinder, with nozzles aligned from one end to the other. A few years later, the Americans engineers William H. Peirce and Elias Anton Cappelen Smith lined it with basic refractory materials, much more durable than that used by the French inventors. While this improvement does not alter the principles of the process, it eases its widespread use, accelerating the switchover of copper production from Britain to the United States. At the beginning of the 21st century, the refine 90% of the copper mattes and is used in 60% of the nickel extracted. This converter, like the addition of pure oxygen, the automation of the running, the treatment of smoke and the increasing size of the tools, ensured the durability of the Manh√®s‚ÄìDavid process, even if modern tools have little relationship with their ancestors.  Converting in copper metallurgy  A mixture of copper and iron sulfides referred to as matte is treated in converters to oxidize iron in the first stage, and oxidize copper in the second stage. In the first stage oxygen enriched air is blown through the tuyeres to partially convert metal sulfides to oxides: :FeS + O2 ‚Üí FeO + SO2 :CuS + O2 ‚Üí CuO + SO2 Since iron has greater affinity to oxygen, the produced copper oxide reacts with the remaining iron sulfide: :CuO + FeS ‚Üí CuS + FeO The bulk of the copper oxide is turned back into the form of sulfide. In order to separate the obtained iron oxide, flux (mainly silica) is added into the converter. Silica reacts with iron oxide to produce a light slag phase, which is poured off through the hood when the converter is tilted around the rotation axis: :2 FeO + SiO2 ‚Üí Fe2SiO4 (sometimes denoted as 2FeO‚Ä¢SiO2, fayalite) After the first portion of slag is poured off the converter, a new portion of matte is added, and the converting operation is repeated many times until the converter is filled with the purified copper sulfide. The converter slag is usually recycled to the smelting stage due to the high content of copper in this by-product. Converter gas contains more than 10% of sulfur dioxide, which is usually captured for the production of sulfuric acid. The second stage of converting is aimed at oxidizing the copper sulfide phase (purified in the first stage), and produces blister copper. The following reaction takes place in the converter: :CuS + O2 ‚Üí Cu + SO2 Copper content in the obtained blister copper is typically more than 95%. Blister copper is the final product of converting.

It involved a discussion concerning relations between Rome (that is, the papal see) and the Holy Roman Empire, which also had an important bearing on the Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry‚Äîwhether Austria was to be part of a federal Germany, or whether Germany would continue without Austria (as a Lesser Germany). Heinrich von Sybel fired the first shot in the dispute in an 1859 lecture, in which he condemned the medieval politics of the German Empire as \\"unnational\\". Julius Ficker countered in 1861 in lectures at the University of Innsbruck, in which he justified the emperors' national politics, which he also presented as universal. While Sybel's was a \\"kleindeutsch-norddeutsch-protestantische\\" (Little German-North German-Protestant) concept of history,Friedrich Schneider, 1940, p. 22. :de:Friedrich Schneider (Historiker) Ficker promoted a Greater Germany which would include Austria. Background The controversy's roots are in the Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry which had grown more intense in the 18th century. Prussia, under Frederick the Great, had emerged as a major European power, and Sybel finds cause for the dispute in early 19th-century Prussian historiography. It continues with the founding of the German Empire under Bismarck in 1871, which had become possible with the Prussian victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Historians have argued that it continued into the 20th century, with Hitler's Anschluss of 1938 as one high point. The disagreement over the politics of the medieval Empire was important because those should determine the political direction and the national identity of the first national German state. Comments by Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht, who like Sybel was a student of Leopold von Ranke, provoked Sybel into taking a public position. In his Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit (1855‚Äì1888), Giesebrecht wrote: \\"Moreover, the period of the Empire is the era when our people, strengthened through unity, had risen to a position of power where it could not only freely determine its own fate, but could also commandeer other peoples, and where the German man exercised his greatest power in the world and the German name had the richest sound\\".Wilhelm Giesebrecht: Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit. Volume 1: Gr√ºndung des Kaisertums. Braunschweig 1863 [first published 1855], page VI. Quote: \\"√úberdies ist die Kaiserzeit die Periode, in der unser Volk, durch Einheit stark, zu seiner h√∂chsten Machtentfaltung gedieh, wo es nicht allein frei √ºber sein eigenes Schicksal verf√ºgte, sondern auch anderen V√∂lkern gebot, wo der deutsche Mann am meisten in der Welt galt und der deutsche Name den vollsten Klang hatte.\\" Sybel countered that throughout the period of the Empire, starting with Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, \\"national\\" interests had been betrayed while the Empire pursued interests in Italy, that its interest in the affairs of the Kingdom of Italy had led only to meaningless loss of life. This was different, according to Sybel, under Otto's father, Henry the Fowler, but after him German politics were aimed in the wrong direction: \\"The powers of the nation, which at first and correctly following instinct had been directed toward the great colonization of the east, were afterwards aimed at an always alluring and always incorrect gleam of power south of the Alps.\\".Schneider, 1941, page 15. Sybel's position suggested the kind of imperialist thinking that found its expression in the famous Drang nach Osten phrase and had become a reality in the Ostsiedlung, the migration and settlement of German-speaking peoples during the Holy Roman Empire. Sybel leaned on this development, even though it hadn't started under Heinrich I but rather in the 12th century, first past the Elbe and then across the Oder, the settlement that had created Prussia, Saxony, and Silesia in Slavic areas. At the inception of the Alldeuscher Verband, this movement was reiterated: \\"The old drive toward the East should be restored\\".Wippermann, 1981, page 87. The development by Friedrich Ratzel, in 1898, of the idea of Lebensraum supported this settler colonialism, which came to be seen as an alternative for the transatlantic migration to America..

It is named after the numerous sites along the Cetina river in Central Dalmatia and Herzegovina. people of this culture were present in caves (Skarin Samograd near Drni≈°, Gudnja near Ston, Ravliƒá cave in Drinovci) or in open settlements (Gradac in Kotorac and Krstina near Posu≈°je).

Origin Cetina culture emerged early in the early Bronze Age on the eneolite substrate (Adriatic culture); its people belonged to the old Mediterranean population, which was partially Indoeuropeanized but was not Indo-European. Area of diffusion The largest number of well-known sites of Cetina culture is located in the interior of Dalmatia, primarily between the upper stream of the Cetina river and the lower Neretva river. Individual finds are documented on Central Dalmatian islands, Palagruz, Northern Adriatic, deep in the interior of the Western Balkans, Albania, Southern Italy, and Greece. Settlements Settlements are the least known aspect of Cetina culture. The most significant deposits of Cetina culture were discovered in the ≈†karin Samograd cave located at the foot of the Mogli brdo, six kilometers northwest of Une≈°iƒá. The amount of findings collected in other researched settlements, mostly caves, suggests mainly temporary inhabitation. The stratigraphy of ≈†karin Samograd enabled Ivan Marovic and Borivoj Covic to produce a three- phase periodization of Cetina culture, which is still used.

A quilter, Bennett begins by creating a sampler quilt in the style of the quilts of Gee's Bend, which uses recycled household and thrift store clothing. Collaborating with Paulson Press (Berkley), an innovative etching technique is used to transfer the quilt to an etching plate. The plate is coated with wax and treated with acid, which pulls the color from the sampler quilt and produces prints of great detail, rendering individual threads, seams, folds, and variation in color, and results in a softground spitbite aquatint etching on paper. Forever (For Old Lady Sally) depicts a colorful composition of blues, greens, red, pink, yellow, and brown colored squares and rectangles.

It is located at the Enipeas ravine at an altitude of 850 m () The original monastery, established in 1542, was destroyed by the Germans in 1943. A new monastery was established at a distance of some 5 km to the northeast of the old one, closer to the town of Litochoro. () . The Agios Dionysios Monastery is a stavropegic monastery, subordinated directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople. Beside the monasteries Kanalon and Agia Triada, Sparmos it is one of the monasteries located at Mount Olympus.  Name  Originally the name of the ancient monastery was Agia Triada (Greek: ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒ± Œ§œÅŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±) meaning Holy Trinity. In time however, the name of its founder, Saint Dionysios of Olympus, has prevailed. The new monastery was named directly after Saint Dionysios.http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/01/saint-dionysios-of- olympus.html  Old Monastery  The old monastery was founded and devoted to the Holy Trinity by Saint Dionysios in 1542. Surrounded by strong high walls with a sizable watchtower, it resembles a small fortress. During various conflicts it served as a shelter for civilians, as well as fighting troops. The monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout its history. It was destroyed in 1821 by Veli Pasha and again by the German Wehrmacht in April 1943. The German military first bombed the monastery and later demolished it with explosives to prevent its use as refuge for Greek resistance fighters. Today visitors can visit the old monastery's ruins just off the road from Litochoro to Prionia. = The chapel of Saint Dionysios = The chapel of Saint Dionysios The chapel of Saint Dionysios is about a twenty minute walk from the old monastery. It is located on the Enipeas River in a southeasterly direction from the monastery, built under an overhanging rock just above a spring. The chapel consists of a small devotional space where the saint celebrated the sacred liturgy during his time as a hermit and a small shed which served as him as a place to sleep.  New Monastery  Sign informing visitors of the abaton rule. The monks abandoned the destroyed monastery and moved into the Metochion, the estate of the monastery. The Metochion was founded in 1650 and consisted of land for farming, a church, economic buildings, and a building in which the monks lived. After the Second World War this estate was gradually expanded into a full monastery. The older part of the new monastery is equipped with a heavy iron door and thus separated from the rest of the compound. It contains the monks' quarters, the refectory, and the administrative building. As is usual with Greek Orthodox monasteries, this part of the monastery is subject to the abaton (\\"inaccessible\\") rule, prohibiting access to female visitors. Just outside are the stables, workshops, and cheese factory. All buildings outside the abaton, such as the new church or the museum, were built after 1985. = The church = The monastery church was built in classical orthodox style, though there are many special features inside in addition to the usual sumptuous decor of an Orthodox church. Many of the church's chairs, standing consoles, and other wooden items are decorated with elaborate marquetry, the inserts of which are made of ivory and mother-of-pearl. Next to a depiction of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a little basket with notes and ball-point pens. Believers who want to make a request to Christ are encouraged to write on the notes. = The museum = To the east of the complex is the museum. In the monastery's troubled times monks hid many monastic treasures in secret vaults in the area's around the old and new monastery. A selection of these rescued treasures are exhibited in the museum: *Three silver skulls, into which bone pieces of saints were worked, are exhibited together with other relics. * Old documents, including the document from the year 949 of the Islamic calendar (1542 AD), in which the Ottoman occupiers allow the repair (in fact probably the foundation) of a monastery on Mount Olympus. * Through a magnifying glass one can admire very fine wood carvings within a metal cross. * An epitaph, embroidered with gold threads, made in 1578-79 by Arsenius, a monk of the Meteora monasteries. * Some of the icons rescued from the old monastery. Photo of German soldiers preparing to blow up the old Agios Dionysios monastery in April 1943. One inconspicuous, but significant exhibit in the museum is a collection of framed black-and-white photographs which hang near the entrance. They show the old monastery in the mountains just before its destruction. A soldier of the German Wehrmacht named Karl Faber took these pictures secretly and sent them to the monastery some years ago.

He specializes on the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars and white dwarf stars in explosive binary star systems known as cataclysmic variables.  Early life  Edward M. Sion is a US citizen of Lebanese descent. Sion received a BA in Astronomy from the University of Kansas in 1968 and an MA in Astronomy from KU in 1969. He received a Ph.D in Astrophysics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1975.  Career  In 1977, Sion co-authored the Catalogue of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarf Stars with George P. McCook. The book was converted to an online directory by Villanova University and contains over 20,000 identified white dwarf stars. The catalog introduced the WD-number, which uses the equatorial coordinate system to identify each white dwarf on the sky. The book and database are frequently referenced in journals since its creation. Sion led a team of collaborators who developed the fundamental classification system of white dwarf stars in 1983. This system is used worldwide, and characterizes both the chemical composition class and surface temperature of each known white dwarf star. In 1984, Sion uncovered empirical evidence that the hydrogen-rich white dwarfs transform into helium-rich white dwarfs when deepening helium convection, as a white dwarf cools, mixes hydrogen downward. In the mid-1990s, Sion led a team of collaborators, using the Hubble Space Telescope, to unveil the physical properties of white dwarfs in explosive cataclysmic variables and how they cool and heat in response to the accretion of mass from a sun-like companion star, a process which leads to nova explosions and, for the most massive white dwarfs, supernova explosions. From 1996, he served as associate editor of The Astrophysical Journal for six years. The Lebanese government founded a non- profit in 2007, which would become their national academy of sciences. Sion was invited to be a founding member of the national academy, the Lebanese Academy of Sciences, a clone of the French Academy of Sciences. Sion's studies of white dwarf stars has led to his publishing over 588 scientific articles of which 246 peer reviewed articles have appeared in journals such the Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics (the European Journal), Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Sion also acts as a featured expert on Big Think, he has also provided commentary for Forbes.  Books   *  Appointments and awards  * 1989 - Outstanding Faculty Research Prize - Villanova University. * 2007 - Founding member of the Lebanese Academy of Sciences. * 2010 - University of Kansas Associate Member, Alumni Advisory Board. * 2014 - Co-Chairman of The Third Middle East and Africa Regional IAU Meeting (MEARIM III) Beirut-Lebanon.

SIDDHAM was established by the European Research Council with start-up funding from the project Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State. The first focus of SIDDHAM was Sanskrit epigraphy, mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods and regions. The corpus is vast: in South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000.Salomon, Richard. Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. SIDDHAM is designed to allow the data to be interrogated across regions, subjects and languages. Inscriptions in any language with an epigraphic tradition are included: Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, Prakrit, Sinhala, Tibetan, Chinese, Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Khmer, Arabic and Persian. The Name In Sanskrit the word siddha·πÉ means \\"success, accomplished, perfected.\\" It was also a symbol and substitution for an \\"auspicious sign\\" found in the oldest Asian inscriptions. In some cases, siddha·πÉ is not spelled out, but indicated with a sign such as Om or a srivasta, and various scholars consider siddha·πÉ in inscriptions to be equivalent to these signs.Lore Sander (1986), Om or Siddham‚ÄìRemarks on Openings of Buddhist Manuscripts and Inscriptions from Gilgit and Central Asia, in Deyadharma: Studies in Memory of Dr. DC Sircar, pages 251-261 Technical background Some of the records in SIDDHAM have been prepared in EpiDoc, a tool for structured markup of epigraphic documents in TEI XML. Other records are presented as simple text documents. All unicode scripts can be accommodated. Features Within SIDDHAM, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, stone slab, copper-plate and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each individual inscription has been assigned a separate SIDDHAM number. A useful example is the Allahabad pillar -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of A≈õoka, Samudragupta and JahƒÅngƒ´r.Falk, Harry. A≈õokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography. Mainz am Rhein: Ph. von Zabern, 2006. The inscription of Samudragupta appears in Siddham as IN00001, inscribed on OB0001.See: https://siddham.network/object/ob00001/ A second example showing the features of the site is the Chinese inscription on a sculpture of seven Buddhas and Maitreya from Bodh Gaya.https://siddham.network/object/obch0005/ Translations Translations of inscription texts into western languages are given where available. Translations are collected and archived separately in the Zenodo community called SIDDHA·πÇ traductions . WIKIPEDIA and WIKICOMMONS SIDDHAM makes full use of Wikipedia and Wikicommons, with embedded hyper-links to images and Wikipedia articles that provide further informations about people, places, objects and special terms. Communities A unique feature of the SIDDHAM site is the community structure. Because data is added on a collaborative basis, those contributing to the site are assigned a community in the area of their special interest. Contributors can add and edit in their community, but cannot edit the materials added by others. This protects the materials of each contributor and allows individuals to configure and style information according to their needs and research interests. In different countries and cultural areas, there are sometimes long-standing protocols for numbering inscriptions. For example, within Khmer epigraphy, inscriptions have been assigned K-numbers for more than a century, a system maintained by EFEO.https://cik.efeo.fr/inventaire-cik-des-inscriptions-khmeres/ SIDDHAM is designed to allow the use of this and other established numbering systems.https://siddham.network/community/khmer-epigraphy/ GIS & Mapping Epigraphic documentation involves mapping the sites where inscriptions were found. The mapping data is added in the appropriate section of the 'tool box' for each object. Contributors have used a range of mapping resources including Wikimapia, OpenStreetMap, as well has scanned maps and plans archived in Zenodo. Paleography While SIDDHAM offers images of inscriptions, objects and the sites where records are located, it is not designed as a tool for the analysis of palaeographic styles. For this, the SIDDHAM links outward to relevant online resources such as INDOSKRIPT.See: http://www.indoskript.org For example, in the case of the pillar inscription of Samudragupta, the record is hyper-linked to no. 75 in INDOSKRIPTSee https://siddham.network/inscription/in00001/ Archive of digital assets All material generated for SIDDHAM is archived automatically in Zenodo.

It is also practised in Quaker Meetings in USA, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. It can be, and is, undertaken by people who are not Quakers as well. Process At the heart of the practice is a meditation which guides Experimenters through four core steps (although the words suggesting each step differ in the various versions): * Mind the Light (pay attention to what your conscience shows in the meditation); * Open your heart to the Truth (look at the reality shown by your conscience, in an attitude of receptivity); * Wait in the Light (exercise patience, let the Light show you what is really going on, in a detached manner); * Submit (welcome the insights and accept them).Experiment with Light website 'About' page.Light to Live by, pp16-22.Experiment with Light in Britain: the Heterotopian Nature of a Contemporary Quaker Spiritual Practice, p9.

A specialist stayer who was favoured by soft ground she won five of her seventeen races in a track career which lasted from September 2011 until May 2014. She failed to win as a two-year-old but made steady improvement when tried over long distance in the following year, winning three races including the two-mile Irish Cesarewitch (by ten lengths). She continued to improve as a four-year-old, winning the Vintage Crop Stakes and recording her biggest win in the Irish St. Leger. She was then sold to race in Australia where she failed to win in four races. Background Voleuse de Coeurs is a bay mare with a large white star bred by the Irish National Stud. As a yearling she was put up for auction at the Goffs Sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨30,000 by Skymarc Farm Inc. She entered the ownership of Lady O'Reilly and was sent into training with Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Teofilo the undefeated European Champion Two-Year-Old of 2006. Teofilo's other progeny have included Trading Leather, Pleascach and Parish Hall, as well as several major winners in Australia. Her dam Vadorga showed no racing ability, finishing unplaced in all three of her races as a three-year-old in France in 2005. She was, however, a full sister to Vahorimix (winner of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and was closely related to Valixir, Val Royal and Valyra. The mare's name is French for Thief of Hearts. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Voleuse de Coeurs finished third of the fifteen runners in a maiden race over one mile at Gowran Park on 24 September. Eleven days later she started at odds of 5/2 for a similar event at Navan Racecourse and finished fifth, more than ten lengths behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Kissed. =2012: three-year-old season= Voleuse de Coeurs began her second season in a maiden over ten and a half furlongs at Dundalk Racecourse in April in which she stayed on well in straight but was beaten a neck into second by the colt Ursa Major. On May 19 the filly started 13/8 favourite for a minor race over eleven and a half furlongs at Wexford Racecourse and recorded her first success as he took the lead two furlong from the finish and won by a length and a quarter from Zabana. Voleuse de Coeurs spent the rest of the season running in handicap races. Racing over middle distances she finished fourth to Ursa Major at the Curragh in June and fourth again to Beach of Falesa at Killarney on 15 July. When moved up in distance for a two miles at Galway Races two weeks later she produced a marked improvement as she took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by eight lengths from the five-year-old Domination. Pat Smullen had ridden Voleuse de Coeurs in all her races up to this point but Leigh Roche took over the ride when the filly contested the Irish Cesarewitch over two miles on heavy ground at the Curragh on 14 October. Carrying 127 pounds, and starting 6/1 favourite in a 27-runner field, she only went to the front a furlong out but then rapidly pulled clear of her rivals to win by ten lengths. Dermot Weld's son and assistant Kris Weld commented \\"We thought she would win and that has been the plan since Galway. It was soft in Galway, but very different conditions today. It was real winter ground and I haven‚Äôt seen it as bad on the Curragh before. Leigh gave her a great ride and dad saw it live in Canada. She won like the decent filly she is. She‚Äôll stay in training and hopefully she can pick up some black type next year\\". =2013: four-year-old season= In 2013 Voleuse de Coeurs made her seasonal debut in a minor race over one and a half miles at Limerick Racecourse in April in which she finished second to El Salvador. On 19 May she was moved back up in distance for the Listed Vintage Crop Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Navan and started 7/4 second choice in the betting behind El Salvador with the best of the other runners appearing to be the high-class hurdler Steps To Freedom. Smullen restrained the filly in the early stages before moving up to take the lead a furlong out at which point Voleuse de Coeurs \\"forged clear\\" to win by two lengths from Missunited. Weld, who trained the horse after which the race was named, said \\"I see her as being very progressive and possibly an outstanding stayer. I thought she would win and this is a race I wanted to win\\". The filly made her first appearance at Group level on 30 June in the Curragh Cup for which she started favourite but came home third behind Ernest Hemingway and Royal Diamond. After a break of almost seven weeks, Voleuse de Coeurs faced Ernest Hemingway and Royal Diamond in the Irish St Leger Trial Stakes at the Curragh on 24 August. She raced in second place behind Royal Diamond for most of the way but was unable to overhaul the leader and finished runner-up, beaten half a length by the winner. Chris Hayes took the ride when Voleuse de Coeurs contested the Group 1 Irish St. Leger at the Curragh on 15 September and started at odds of 9/1 in a ten-runner field. The British- trained gelding Ahzeemah (winner of the Lonsdale Cup) started favourite while the other runners included Royal Diamond, Ernest Hemingway, Red Cadeaux, Saddler's Rock (Goodwood Cup) and Pale Mimosa (Saval Beg Stakes). Royal Diamond took an early lead and set the pace with Voleuse de Coeurs settled in mid-division before making steady progress from half way. The filly took the lead three furlongs out and went clear of the field, winning by six lengths from Ahzeemah despite being eased down by Hayes in the final strides. Although Lady O'Reilly talked of retiring the filly, Dermot Weld said \\"She's a smart filly and a model of consistency\\", he said after the race. \\"She ran a cracking trial behind Royal Diamond and I knew she would improve for that. She's a joy to train and is very straightforward... I will try and encourage Lady O'Reilly to keep her in training as I think she will be a high-class Cup mare at five.\\" In October Voleuse de Coeurs was bought privately by an Australian-based group and was redirected to the Melbourne Cup. The Australian Mick Moroney immediately became her official trainer and she was sent into quarantine for her journey to Melbourne. On 5 November at Flemington Racecourse the filly started at odds of 17/1 for the Melbourne Cup and finished tenth of the 24 runners behind Fiorente. =2014: five-year-old season= Voleuse de Coeurs remained in training with Moroney in Australia for the first half of 2014. She made little impression in three starts against top-class opposition, finishing fifth in the Australian Cup, fifth in The BMW and twelfth in the Sydney Cup.

It is endemic to New Zealand and is found over most of the North Island, except for the Wellington region and regions 900 metres above sea level. This species is an arboreal, herbivorous generalist however, it is also thought to be polyphagous and is found in all wooded habitats, including forest, scrub and suburban gardens. left left H. thoracica is morphologically uniform but chromosomally polymorphic. It comprises at least eight chromosomal races with diploid numbers from 2n=11 (XO) to 2n=23 (XO). There are hybrid zones where some of the chromosomal races meet. Phylogenetically, it is most closely related to the other North Island species (H. crassidens and H. trewicki). The conservation status of H. thoracica is \\"not threatened\\" however, the chromosome race on Karikari Peninsular (2n=23/24) is listed as \\"nationally vulnerable\\". Taxonomy Female Hemideina thoracica was first described by Scottish zoologist Adam White in 1846, but at that time included in the genus Deinacrida.Hemideina at OSF It was later made the type species for the wƒìtƒÅ genus Hemideina, described in 1869 by Walker. Habitat and distribution The Auckland tree wƒìtƒÅ, Hemideina thoracica is endemic to New Zealand and has a wide distribution over the northern two-thirds of the North Island. It is abundant in central and north North Island where it inhabits forest or scrub at lowland elevation. As a nocturnal and arboreal herbivore this species uses tree cavities to rest and conceal itself in during the day before emerging at night to feed. It is parapatric with two other Hemideina spp. in the North Island: H. crassidens and H. trewicki and in warmer areas it is thought to competitively exclude H. crassidens which is distributed in the lower North Island and north-west of the South Island. Diet Dorsal view of male; illustration by alt= Like other tree wƒìtƒÅ Hemideina thoracica forages arboreally at night, eating mostly leaves and some fruit and seeds from a range of different plants. Recently, it has been suggested that this species feeds selectively on a range of plant species and is omnivorous with invertebrates and fruit and seeds included in the diet.. Plants are selectively eaten with species such as Mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus) or Karamu (Coprosma robusta) preferred. However, Auckland tree wƒìtƒÅ also feed on small insects and are thought to be polyphagous. H. thoracica inhabiting higher elevation sites have been shown to consume more invertebrates and fewer plant species than those at low elevation habitats. Morphology Hemideina thoracica are large-bodied as adults (3‚Äì7 g), being up to 40mm in length. The abdomen is brown and the pronotum pale with dark hieroglyph-like markings. This body colouration makes H. thoracica easily distinguishable from the Wellington tree wƒìtƒÅ (H. crassidens) with which it is parapatric. As in other Hemideina spp. spines are present on the hind legs which function in defense. Morphometric analysis of spination patterns has shown that both H. thoracica and H. crassidens lack the mid-tibial ‚Äò1/3 back‚Äô spine which differentiates these species from all other Hemideina spp.. Hemideina thoracica has the thinnest femur and tibia compared with all other New Zealand tree wƒìtƒÅ (Hemideina spp). Adults are sexually dimorphic with males having enlarged mandibles used for fighting other males. Cytogenetics Tree weta carved on pare on display at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection at Landcare Research, Auckland. Hemideina thoracica is chromosomally polymorphic meaning that differential chromosomal arrangement occurs among populations of this species. Nine distinct chromosome races each comprising a different karyotype have been described and these range in diploid numbers from 2n=11 (XO) to 2n=23 (XO). Five different hybrid zones have been located where, in different combinations six of the nine chromosome races come into contact with one another. Three of these zones (Mt. Camel, Karikari and Waitangi) involve northern chromosome races which likely originated in the Pliocene, whereas the southern races in the Bream Bay and Taupo zones are likely to be much younger. Despite having differing chromosome numbers, morphology of H. thoracica is uniform (see 'Morphology' above). Behaviour At East Cape Hemideina thoracica is capable of producing sound using stridulation of the metathoracic legs and the abdomen. Both males and females produce a rasping sound when disturbed by raising and extending the legs above the body followed by a defensive kick while tightly holding the legs against the abdomen. Using abdominal oscillation, males also generate an intraspecific song when in close contact with one another. However, H. thoracica has poor mate recognistion systems and forms sterile hybrids with H. crassidens and H. trewicki where they are sympatric in the southern North Island. As a nocturnal species, H. thoracica occupy cavities during the day and occupancy patterns have been shown to be influenced by both season and sex of previous occupants. Females tend to avoid cavities in which other females reside and are found in cavities alone however, this changes during summer when females form harems Males and females which were previously living apart begin living together in early summer. Breeding It has been suggested that Auckland tree wƒìtƒÅ have a polygynandrous mating system whereby both males and females mate with multiple partners. This species is a hemimetabolous insect whose eggs hatch in Spring with a minimum of eight instars required to reach adulthood. Females lay eggs in the soil and provide no maternal care. Conservation Lateral view The conservation status of Hemideina thoracica is \\"not threatened\\" however, the chromosome race on Karikari Peninsular (2n=23/24) is listed as \\"nationally vulnerable\\". Artificial refuges have been used to monitor populations of H. thoracica and H. crassidens and could potentially be used in conservation management of these species by providing available habitat.

Wrangel was a sister ship to HSwMS Wachtmeister. The ship class were among the most modern destroyers in the world just after the end of World War I. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 she was stationed as part of the Gothenburg Squadron. Wrangel was decommissioned in 1947 and was subsequently used as a pilot and target vessel and sunk on H√•rsfj√§rden in 1960. The ship was named after admiral Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Design Wrangels hull was made of nitrated steel. Like former Swedish destroyers, the ship had no proper superstructure on the bow, but had only a protective skirt wall for the command bridge, though there was a small superstructure on the stern. The propulsion machinery consisted of four steam boilers which delivered steam to two steam turbines. The machine generated an output of 11,500 horsepower, giving a maximum speed of 34 knots. Each boiler had a separate funnel, which led to the common four stack arrangement of the time. The two steam turbines were of a new type with reduction gears, which meant that the turbine speed could be shifted down to lower the propeller speed, giving the machinery a better efficiency. On delivery, the ship's main artillery consisted of two 7.5 cm guns m/12 that were placed on the front and rear deck. The close-range protection consisted of two 6.5 mm machine guns m/14 that were placed on either side of the command bridge. The torpedo armament consisted of six 45.7 cm torpedo tubes m/14. Four of these stood as in the previous class in two double stands on the main deck. What was new was that two more were placed behind gaps in the front of the hull. History Wrangel was built at Lindholm's Gothenburg shipyard and was launched on September 24, 1917. After fitting out and trials she was delivered to the Swedish Navy on May 4, 1918. In 1923, Crown Prince Gustav Adolf would be engaged to Louise Mountbatten with the engagement taking place in England. On 28 June, Wrangel went from Karlskrona together with her sister ship Wachtmeister and all three ships in the Sverige class. On July 2 they went to Sheerness, England where the couple visited the ships. A couple of days later, the journey proceeded to Rosyth, Scotland, where they visited the English Atlantic fleet before going back to Sweden. In the mid-1920s, the ship's boilers, which were initially coal-fired, were converted to oil-fired. = World War II = In 1939, the ship was redeployed, when the forward two torpedo tubes were removed and a 25 mm anti-aircraft automatic gun was added. Furthermore, the two machine guns were replaced with an 8 mm anti-aircraft machine gun m/36 that was mounted on the aft bridge and two depth charge positions with 16 depth charges m/24. During the beginning of World War II, Wrangel together with her sister ship was part of the Gothenburg Squadron. In the winter of 1940-1941 the ship would receive new boilers, but by late autumn 1943 she was put into material reserve in Stockholm. =Fate= After Wrangel was placed in reserve, she never would be reactivated and was released from service on June 13, 1947. Thereafter she was used as a pilot and target vessel and sank in H√•rsfj√§rden in 1960.

Founded in 2013 in New York City, the company's mission was to make computing more immersive and human. The company designed and manufactured in-ear computing technology, including earplugs and wireless smart earbuds.  History  Doppler Labs was co-founded by Noah Kraft and Fritz Lanman. Kraft had previously worked in the entertainment industry, and was employed as a strategic consultant for Google working for John Hanke on a mobile game called Ingress. Kraft also worked for Lyor Cohen during the founding of 300 Entertainment. Lanman was an executive at Microsoft and a prominent angel investor. In July 2015, Doppler raised $17 million in Series B funding bringing the company's total funding to over $50 million. The round was led by The Chernin Group, Wildcat Capital Management, and Acequia Capital and included luminary investors like Henry Kravis, David Geffen, Blake Krikorian, Dan Gilbert, David Bonderman and Barry Sternlicht. Doppler Labs first product was DUBS Acoustic Filters, high-tech ear plugs designed that use a proprietary 17-piece physical acoustic filter system to reduce the sound pressure at different frequencies while maintaining acoustical fidelity. In July 2016, Doppler Labs Labs launched Here Active Listening at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and in 2017 launched its flagship product Here One, a pair of wireless smart earbuds that allow users to selectively filter ambient sound, stream music, and amplify speech. It can also be used to take phone calls and selectively filter certain sounds, such as background noise. Here One has been called the world‚Äôs first in-ear computer. In March 2017, Doppler Labs sued Bose for trademark infringement of their Here Buds trademark. The company supported the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017 (OTC Hearing Aid Act). On November 1, 2017, Doppler Labs announced that the company would be winding down operations, and officially closed on December 1. The company cited problems raising additional Series C funding as the reason for the company shutting down. Wired wrote that the company unsuccessfully explored options to stay afloat including partnership, investment, and acquisition from companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It was preparing to launch its next product, Here Two, in 2018.  Products  Before voice assistants or true wireless technology were prevalent, Doppler Labs envisioned that computing would move onto the body and into the ear and that voice would become a more primary interface for how humans interact with technology. With Apple‚Äôs removal of the headphone jack, the launch of the AirPods, and the prevalence of Alexa, the smart earbud category that Doppler helped create was expected to become a $40 billion industry by 2020. Here One Schematic Doppler Labs The company develops and distributes the Here One Wireless Smart Earbuds, a pair of wireless 3-in-1 earbuds that combine premium audio streaming, smart noise cancellation, and speech enhancement into a single form factor, as well as DUBS Acoustic Filters high-tech earplug. The company previously developed and released the predecessor to Here One called Here Active Listening, which was originally launched on Kickstarter. Doppler Labs has announced and demonstrated future product features, including real- time language translation and its ‚Äúmachine hearing‚Äù system.  Partners  In addition to its pre-existing partnerships with the Tao Group, Coachella, Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, in November 2016, Doppler Labs announced seven new partnerships with The New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, JetBlue, Gimlet Media, MADE Fashion and The New York Mets to bring Here One technology to sporting events, museums, concert halls, and other live environments. In December 2016, they also partnered with the Global Citizen Festival to launch #HereTogether, a movement aimed at bringing greater global awareness around efforts to prevent hearing loss and to promote innovation in hearing accessibility As part of this initiative, Doppler Labs announced its Hearing Bill of Rights in April 2017  Awards and recognitions  * Inc Magazine‚Äôs Game Changing Inventions of 2015 * TIME Magazine‚Äôs Best Inventions of 2015 * Fast Company‚Äôs World‚Äôs Most Innovative Companies in 2016 * SXSW‚Äôs Best of Show in 2016 * Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Gold for Product Design in 2016 * Named among Forbes Magazine‚Äôs Next Billion-Dollar Startups list of 2016. * TechCrunch Crunchies Hardware of the Year Runner-Up Award in 2017  References  Category:Information technology companies of the United States Category:Headphones manufacturers Category:Electronics companies established in 2013 Category:American companies established in 2013 Category:2017 disestablishments in California Category:Electronics companies disestablished in 2017 Category:2013 establishments in New York City ","title":"Doppler Labs"},{"id":"54953207","text":"Gunhild Margareta Olsson (born 30 January 1946) is a Swedish sprinter.

The tournament received criticism from at least one media outlet, citing that the ‚Çπ3.7cr spent to organize the tournament was significantly more than the entire yearly budget for the women's national team. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai but was changed the week before the tournament because of financial disagreements with the stadium's operators. India Head coach Stephen Constantine revealed that the intention was to hold a 4-team tournament with India competing against teams from the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. However another Asian team did not participate. India won the tournament with a 1‚Äì1 draw with Saint Kitts and Nevis on the final matchday.

Language Yawijibaya appears to have been a dialect closely related to the Worrorra branch of the mainland Worrorran language family, and similar to Umiida and Unggarrangu. Though little is known of it, a brief grammar survives, written up by the missionary Howard Coate. Country Yawijibaya country, altogether a little less than was confined to the Montgomery Islands, the surrounding reefs, and the islands in the southern area of Collier Bay. The main island in the group was called Jawutjap (Yawijib(a)). Social organization The Yawijibaya moiety system was essentially identical to that which prevailed among the mainland tribes on the coast opposite. While Coate and Norman Tindale stated that the Yawijibaya were strictly islanders, Valda Blundell's informants claimed two Yawijibaya clans had mainland estates, while another two maintains their estates on the Montgomery and the High Cliffy islands. She also thought that the mainland norm of asymmetrical wife exchanges between tribes obtaining on the continent was not repeated among the Yawijibaya, who were said to maintain a restricted inter-island clan system of wife exchange. The evidence is difficult to evaluate, given it came not from living Yawijibaya, but informants from tribes where amalgamation of customs had already taken place for some considerable time. Excavations on High Cliffy Island have uncovered extensive stone structures, some consisting of dry-stone formwork only evidenced elsewhere on the other side of the continent at Lake Condah in Victoria. The island lies east of the Montgomery group. It takes its name from the geophysical feature of steeply rising up cliffs to a height of some 15 metres. In addition, 3 rock shelters, and several work sites, high- quality quartz sandstone, chert and limestone quarries, dugong-butchering areas and places for working metal harpoons, were revealed. Given the presence of glassware, pottery and clay pipe material, it was suggested initially that the stone building might have been the handiwork of Makassar traders. The analysis concluded that the structures were of Aboriginal manufacture. One possibility is that they are the remains of monsoonal refuges, where the Yawijibaya could retire to, in order to escape the mosquitoe and sandfly infestations that would have plagued their low-lying mangrove-fringed islands as the rains set in. The quarry works clearly have a trade purpose and are unique for the area and are unexampled on otherwise similar mainland locations, O'Connors argues: > large quantities of artefactual material found all over the High Cliffy > Island testify to a level of stone working not seen in any of the mainland > rockshelters and open sites. Mythology Howard Coate suggested that the rai myths of a spirit-child, encountered widely in this region, and also among the island and coastal peoples (Bardi, Umiida and Unggarranggu) contiguous with the Yawijibaya, formed part of Yawijibaya thinking. These properly refer to 'conception totems' (raya). According to one of their legends, the islands once formed a continuous landmass, which was destroyed when a tidal event washed over the area, leaving only islands in its wake. History The missionary and expert on the Worrorra, J. R. B. Love maintained that the Yawijibaya were being completely assimilated into the Worrorra people by the 1930s, as a clan of the latter's Atpalar moiety. Valda Blundell recorded that in the early 1970s there was still one very old Yawijibaya man from the Montgomery islands resident at the Lombidina mission. The von Brandenstein hypothesis In the sparse ethnographic literature, remarks are to be found to the effect that the Yawijibaya were physically quite dissimilar to other indigenous peoples of the region. J. R. B. Love stated that they were of 'men of a distinct physical type.' The Yawijibaya ethnonym figured as part of the key linguistic evidence which Carl Georg von Brandenstein adduced in support of his claim that there was a secret Portuguese prehistory of colonization of Australia, a theory he based on etymologies of words in East Kimberley place-names. He argued that there were two moieties on the Montgomery isles, the Yawuji-Bara and the Yawuji-Baia. These, von Brandenstein thought, made sense once they were re- analysed as forms of a Portuguese creole respectively going back to av√≥s-de- bara ('ancestors of the bar/breakwater') and av√≥s de-baia ('ancestors of the bay'). In von Brandenstein's reconstruction, it followed that the Yawijibaya were descendants of Portuguese African slaves who had persisted in speaking their creole long after their masters had forsaken the island, and this deeply affected the language that was spoken there. Aside from the fact that no such tribal opposition has been attested in the ethnographical literature, the phonetic distinction it was based on probably did not exist, the first term simply representing a mishearing of the second, namely yawiji-baya.

A SAML metadata document describes a SAML deployment such as a SAML identity provider or a SAML service provider. Deployments share metadata to establish a baseline of trust and interoperability. Introduction to SAML metadata To securely interoperate, partners share metadata in whatever form and by whatever means possible. In any case, at least the following metadata must be shared: * Entity ID * Cryptographic keys * Protocol endpoints (bindings and locations) Every SAML system entity has an entity ID, a globally-unique identifier used in software configurations, relying-party databases, and client-side cookies. On the wire, every SAML protocol message contains the entity ID of the issuer. For authentication purposes, a SAML message may be digitally signed by the issuer. To verify the signature on the message, the message receiver uses a public key known to belong to the issuer. Similarly, to encrypt a message, a public encryption key belonging to the ultimate receiver must be known to the issuer. In both situations‚Äîsigning and encryption‚Äîtrusted public keys must be shared in advance. Once the message is signed and encrypted, the issuer sends the message to a trusted protocol endpoint, the location of which must be known in advance. Upon receipt, the message receiver decrypts the message (using its own private decryption key) and verifies the signature (using a trusted public key in metadata) before mapping the entity ID in the message to a trusted partner. The previous scenario requires each party to know the other in advance. To establish a baseline of trust, parties share metadata with each other. Initially, this may be as simple as sharing information via email. Over time, as the number of SAML partners grows, the natural tendency is to automate the metadata sharing process. To fully automate the metadata sharing process, a standard file format is needed. To this end, the SAML V2.0 Metadata specification defines a standard representation for SAML metadata that simplifies the configuration of SAML software and makes it possible to create secure, automated processes for metadata sharing. Metadata-driven interoperability As SAML technology has matured, the importance of SAML metadata has steadily increased. Today an implementation that supports SAML web browser requires a schema-valid SAML metadata file for each SAML partner. (See the SAML V2.0 Profiles specification for more information about SAML web browser SSO.) SAML web browser SSO with static metadata configuration =Static metadata configuration= The term static metadata refers to a metadata file that is configured directly into the SAML application by an administrator. In doing so, the administrator becomes responsible for the maintenance of the metadata regardless of how the metadata was obtained in the first place. Thus static metadata contributes to the overall static configuration of the SAML application. Unfortunately, SAML metadata is inherently non-static as illustrated by the following typical scenario between a SAML identity provider (IdP) and a SAML service provider (SP). Suppose an IdP owner obtains SAML metadata from an SP partner. Perhaps the SP metadata is transmitted to the IdP owner via email, or maybe the IdP owner logs into a protected web app and downloads the SP metadata via a browser. Regardless of how the metadata is obtained, the end result is the same: The IdP owner configures the SP metadata directly into the IdP software. Now suppose the SP metadata contains a public encryption key. Presumably, the corresponding private decryption key is configured into the SP software. If the private decryption key is compromised (or otherwise needs to be replaced), the public encryption key in the SP metadata is no longer trustworthy and must be replaced as well. Since the SP metadata is statically configured in the IdP software, only the IdP owner can replace the public encryption key in the SP metadata. In this sense, the IdP owner is responsible for the SP metadata. This mismatch leads to interoperability issues. The same is true on the SP side. By statically configuring IdP metadata into the SP software, the SP owner implicitly accepts the responsibility to maintain the IdP metadata when something changes. Since an IdP (or SP) typically has many partners, static metadata configuration clearly does not scale, and moreover, change management associated with static metadata is difficult at best. SAML web browser SSO with automated metadata exchange =Dynamic metadata exchange= Not surprisingly, metadata sharing processes yearn to be automated. Every metadata file that is statically configured into the SAML application by an administrator incurs technical debt. The accumulation of this debt prevents the SAML deployment from scaling to its potential. To avoid excessive technical debt, the metadata sharing process must be automated. One approach is to enlist the help of a trusted third party whose responsibility it is to collect, curate, and distribute metadata across the network. Curated metadata is consistently formatted, more likely to be free of vulnerabilities (intentional or otherwise), and therefore safe to use. In the case of SAML metadata, this trusted third party is called a SAML federation. The community of SAML deployers comprising the federation willingly conform to one or more profiles of SAML to promote interoperability and trust. To that end, federation participants often share a central infrastructure for metadata sharing, which allows the federation to scale to thousands of interoperable SAML deployments. A history of SAML metadata Now let's retrace some of the steps that led to the publication of the SAML V2.0 Metadata specification in March 2005. A turning point occurred on 14 November 2003--our story starts there. =Historical origins= In response to Microsoft Passport, the Liberty Alliance conceived the Identity Federation Framework, a federation technology developed over a three-year period between 2002 and 2004. (The previously mentioned history of SAML provides context for ID-FF.) On 14 November 2003, Liberty contributed ID-FF 1.2 to OASIS. The contribution included a document entitled Liberty Metadata Description and Discovery Specification Version 1.0, which included the following design goals: # \\"whois for SAML federations\\" (based on the \`Organization\` and \`ContactPerson\` elements in metadata) # dynamic discovery of metadata (with resolution via DNS and Well-Known Location) # document-level security using XML Signature As it turns out, all of those goals were preserved in the OASIS SAML V2.0 Metadata Standard described later in this article. The schema document included with the legacy Liberty ID-FF 1.2 archive is identified as Liberty Metadata Version 1.1 whereas Liberty Metadata Version 1.0 was contributed to OASIS. The apparent contradiction was explained by the schema's author. (Peter Davis, Personal Communication) Between November 2003 (when Version 1.0 was contributed to OASIS) and December 2004 (when Version 1.1 was completed by Liberty), development of the Liberty metadata specification continued in parallel with the OASIS work stream. See the chart below for a visual representation. The arrows in the chart indicate dependencies while the dashed lines indicate equivalencies. SAML metadata dependencies Relevant references into the Liberty work stream are given at the end of this article. The original metadata schema contributed to OASIS is listed in its entirety in section 7 of the Liberty Metadata Version 1.0 specification. Similarly, the specification for Liberty Metadata Version 1.1 includes a listing of the Version 1.1 schema. Both the Version 1.0 schema and the Version 1.1 schema are linked here courtesy of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. =Post-November 2003= Over the next thirteen months, from November 2003 to December 2004, the OASIS Security Services (SAML) Technical Committee (SSTC) molded the Liberty metadata specification into what eventually became known as SAML Metadata. During that time, the SSTC generalized the metadata specification to include support for multiple protocols (including non-SAML protocols) but more importantly, the Liberty metadata schema was retrofitted with numerous extension points. Historically, the extensibility of SAML Metadata has had important consequences, as we shall see. By March 2004, most of the Liberty contribution was incorporated into the OASIS work stream. From that point onward, the Liberty and OASIS work streams progressed concurrently (but not independently since the same people were working on both specifications). Between March and July 2004, the fledgling SAML Metadata specification underwent significant churn. In July 2004, the SSTC issued a public call for comments covering a complete set of SAML V2.0 draft specifications. Included in that specification set was a working draft of a newly forged SAML V2.0 Metadata specification. In retrospect, it appears as though the bulk of the SAML V2.0 Metadata specification was developed between March and July 2004, but clearly the SAML V2.0 Metadata Standard sprung from the loins of the Liberty Alliance, specifically Liberty Metadata Version 1.0. Consequently, to understand the origins of SAML Metadata, one must study the provenance of Liberty metadata. The remaining history of SAML Metadata is mostly OASIS administrative process. After the final Committee Draft was published in November 2004, the SSTC began the standardization process in January 2005. Finally, on 5 March 2005, OASIS announced the newly ratified SAML V2.0 Standard. The V2.0 specification set (see the References section for a complete list) included the final SAML V2.0 Metadata specification. A decade later, in September 2015, OASIS published a revised SAML Metadata specification with errata. As a result, the original metadata specification was deprecated, as were the other documents in the original 2.0 specification set. During the intervening decade, between 2005 and 2015, the SSTC developed a number of \\"Post-V2.0\\" draft specifications. Some of these draft documents became Committee Specifications. A select subset of these Committee Specifications are listed in the References section at the end of this article. =Pre-November 2003= As it turns out, the influence of the Liberty Identity Federation Framework on SAML Metadata predates the contribution of ID-FF 1.2 in November 2003. Apparently the SSTC was dabbling in metadata in parallel with the Liberty Alliance. An excerpt from a draft metadata specification published in September 2003 bears this out: > This document defines metadata that describe the elements and attributes > required to use the SAML Web Browser SSO Profiles. Since the Liberty > Alliance Web SSO Profiles are directly based on the SAML Web SSO Profiles, > the metadata defined in this document borrows extensively from the metadata > definitions in the draft Liberty Alliance 1.2 specifications. (Excerpted > from \\"Metadata for SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profiles\\") The revision history at the end of that draft document gives the following characterization of itself: \\"Initial draft based on Draft 07 of SAML 1.1 Metadata specification.\\" In other words, earlier draft documents were published. Indeed, the revision history at the end of the previous draft shows a trail of metadata specifications dating back to November 2002. Following the document trail, the influence of Liberty ID-FF on SAML metadata can be traced to a draft specification published in April 2003. This is the first known OASIS document that references Liberty ID-FF, specifically, Liberty Metadata Version 1.0-06, an early version of the Liberty Metadata specification about which little is known. It is, however, clear that \\"Metadata for SAML 1.1 Web Browser Profiles\\" was intended to be a companion to the SAML V1.1 Standard but of course we know that V1.1 does not specify the use of metadata. See the next section for relevant conjecture. Two early metadata schema may be of interest: # In June 2002, barely a month after the SSTC completed its work on what was to become the SAML V1.0 Standard, the Shibboleth project developed a metadata schema consisting of \`\` and \`\` elements. This schema would drive the initial versions of the Shibboleth IdP software. # In February 2003, the SSTC released a draft schema for a metadata specification entitled \\"Metadata for SAML 1.0 Web Browser Profiles.\\" That schema remains a curiosity, however, since the very next version of that document stream (and all subsequent versions) would exhibit the Liberty metadata syntax. There is no evidence to suggest that either of these early attempts to define a metadata schema had any appreciable effect on the development of the Liberty metadata schema. =Historical summary= We know that metadata standards for SAML V1.0 or SAML V1.1 were never published. We also know that the necessary IPR for Liberty Metadata was not in place until November 2003. With that, we offer the following summary and conjecture: # A draft specification entitled \\"Metadata for SAML 1.0 Web Browser Profiles\\" was the first known SAML metadata specification. The document is dated 12 November 2002, which is one week after the SAML V1.0 Standard was announced, which is curious. In any case, the metadata syntax used in that document is completely different from what we now know as SAML Metadata. That document was never published and its origins remain a mystery. # A draft specification entitled \\"Metadata for SAML 1.1 Web Browser Profiles\\" was the first known SAML metadata specification based on Liberty ID-FF. It was completed in April 2003. The title of the draft specification makes it clear that the SSTC knew that SAML V1.1 was coming and moreover SAML metadata was to be included in the SAML V1.1 Standard. # Unfortunately that did not happen since the necessary IPR was not in place when the SAML V1.1 Standard was announced. Indeed, the formal contribution of Liberty ID-FF 1.2 to OASIS occurred two months after the announcement of the SAML V1.1 Standard in September 2003. # In September 2003, less than two weeks after the announcement of the SAML V1.1 Standard, the SSTC set its sights on SAML V2.0 by forking the document stream and renaming the draft document: \\"Metadata for SAML 2.0 Web Browser Profiles.\\" # SAML Metadata came to life between March and July 2004. The SSTC issued a public call for comments that included a candidate SAML Metadata specification. # The final SAML Metadata specification was included in the SAML V2.0 Standard specification set announced in March 2005. # For the next 10 years, the specification documents evolved (but the schema remained stable). A specification for SAML V2.0 Metadata with Errata (SAMLMeta20Errata) was published in September 2015. =Post-V2.0 specifications= As mentioned earlier, the SAML V2.0 Metadata Schema has numerous extension points. This feature led to a proliferation of \\"Post-V2.0\\" specifications that extended the standard in several directions. The more popular metadata extensions are listed below for convenience (see the examples for specific use cases): # SAML V2.0 Metadata Extensions for Registration and Publication Information Version 1.0. # SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for Entity Attributes. # SAML V2.0 Metadata Extensions for Login and Discovery User Interface Version 1.0. # Identity Provider Discovery Service Protocol and Profile. # Service Provider Request Initiation Protocol and Profile Version 1.0. # SAML V2.0 Metadata Profile for Algorithm Support Version 1.0. An important \\"Post-V2.0\\" specification is the SAML V2.0 Metadata Interoperability Profile, which builds on the premise that a formal public key infrastructure (PKI) can be extremely complex and in some cases intractable (it is well known, for example, that browser-facing TLS certificate revocation is broken). In essence, the Metadata Interoperability Profile is an attempt to provide a workable key revocation mechanism for SAML federations. Since its publication in August 2009, the Metadata Interoperability Profile has been a particularly influential document, especially in higher education (see, for example, the certificate-related requirements for deployers in one large R&E; federation). Metadata interoperability plays a key role in a formal implementation profile published by the Kantara Initiative: Indeed, the key feature that distinguishes a scalable SAML implementation (from one that is not) is metadata interoperability. SAML metadata examples In this section we give concrete examples of the SAML entity descriptor, the basic unit of policy and interoperability in SAML metadata. Each of the examples includes the following metadata bits: * Entity ID and entity attributes * Role descriptor (describing either a SAML identity provider or a SAML service provider) ** User interface elements ** Signing keys or encryption keys ** Single sign-on protocol endpoints * Registration and publication info * Organization and contact info (for human readers) In the examples below, a particular URI in metadata (such as an \`entityID\` or an endpoint location) maps to a responsible party via the URI's domain component: * The organization that owns domain \`example.info\` is responsible for an unspecified SAML entity (such as an identity provider or a service provider) * The organization that owns domain \`example.org\` is responsible for a SAML identity provider * The organization that owns domain \`example.com\` is responsible for a SAML service provider * The organization that owns domain \`example.net\` is a trusted 3rd party responsible for metadata registration and publication Note that SAML metadata describes all parties involved in metadata-driven SAML Web Browser SSO except the browser user. (See the SAML V2.0 Profiles specification for more information about SAML web browser SSO.) =Entity metadata= The following code sample illustrates the common technical features of a SAML \`\` element: https://registrar.example.net/category/self-certified ... ... https://www.example.info/ SAML Technical Support mailto:technical- support@example.info Note the following details about this general entity descriptor: * The \`entityID\` attribute is the unique identifier of the entity. Note well that the \`entityID\` is an immutable name for the entity, not a location. * The \`validUntil\` attribute gives the expiration date of the metadata. * The \`\` element (which has been omitted for simplicity) contains a digital signature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the metadata. The signatory is assumed to be a trusted 3rd party called a metadata registrar. * The \`\` extension element asserts an identifier for the metadata registrar. * The \`\` extension element asserts the metadata publisher (which happens to be the same as the registrar). The \`creationInstant\` attribute gives the precise instant the metadata was created. Comparing the value of the \`creationInstant\` attribute to the value of the \`validUntil\` attribute, we see that the metadata is valid for two weeks. * The \`\` extension element includes a single entity attribute. The entity attribute claims that the entity is \\"self-certified,\\" a presumably desirable quality. * The organization identified in the \`\` element is \\"responsible for the entity\\" described by the entity descriptor (section 2.3.2 of SAMLMeta). The \`\` element contains one or more language-qualified child elements of each type. * The contact information in the \`\` element identifies a technical contact responsible for the entity. Multiple contacts and contact types are possible. See section 2.3.2.2 of SAMLMeta. The all-important role descriptor has been omitted from this initial example for brevity. The SAML metadata specification defines numerous concrete instances of the md:RoleDescriptor abstract type (section 2.4.1 of SAMLMeta). The two most important roles are described by the \`\` element and the \`\` element. Each of these role descriptors is illustrated in the subsections below. =Identity provider metadata= A SAML identity provider manages a Single Sign-On Service endpoint that receives authentication requests from service providers. The entity descriptor for an identity provider in that role contains an \`\` element, which itself contains at least one \`\` endpoint. The following example illustrates two such endpoints: https://registrar.example.net/category/self-certified Example.org The identity provider at Example.org https://idp.example.org/myicon.png ... Example.org Non-Profit Org Example.org https://www.example.org/ SAML Technical Support mailto:technical-support@example.org The content of the \`\` element describes the Single Sign-On Service at the identity provider. Note the following details about this element: * The \`\` container contains a set of language- qualified extension elements used to build dynamic user interfaces at the service provider. The most important user interface at the service provider is the identity provider discovery interface. * The identity provider software is presumably configured with a private SAML signing key. The corresponding public key is included in the \`\` element. In the above example, the key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity. * The \`Binding\` attributes of the \`\` elements are standard URIs specified in the SAML 2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind). The values of the \`md:SingleSignOnService/@Location\` attributes in identity provider metadata are used by a service provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue identity provider orchestrating a man-in-the-middle attack. =Service provider metadata= A SAML service provider manages an Assertion Consumer Service endpoint that receives authentication assertions from identity providers. The entity descriptor for a service provider in that role contains an \`\` element, which itself contains at least one \`\` endpoint. The following example illustrates such an endpoint: https://registrar.example.net/category/self-certified Example.com Vendor Service https://service.example.com/about.html https://service.example.com/privacy.html https://service.example.com/myicon.png ... urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid- format:transient Example.com Employee Portal Example.com Inc. Example.com https://www.example.com/ SAML Technical Support mailto:technical- support@example.com The content of the \`\` element describes the Assertion Consumer Service at the service provider. Note the following details about this element: * The \`WantAssertionsSigned\` attribute on the \`\` element declares that the service provider wants the \`\` element to be digitally signed. This attribute causes a metadata-aware identity provider to auto- configure itself at run time. * The \`\` extension element contains a set of language-qualified extension elements used to build dynamic user interfaces at the identity provider. Two important user interfaces at the identity provider are the login page and the user consent interface. * The \`\` extension element defines an endpoint used in conjunction with identity provider discovery. * The service provider software is presumably configured with a private SAML decryption key. A public SAML encryption key is included in the \`\` element. In the above example, the key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity. * The \`\` element gives the desired format of the \`\` element in the SAML assertion. The presence of this element causes a metadata-aware identity provider to auto-configure itself at run time. * The \`index\` attribute of an \`\` element is used as the value of the \`AssertionConsumerServiceIndex\` attribute in a \`\` element. * The \`Binding\` attribute of the \`\` element is a standard URI specified in the SAML 2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind). * The \`\` element is used by the identity provider to formulate an \`\` element that is pushed to the service provider in conjunction with SAML Web Browser SSO. * The \`index\` attribute of the \`\` element is used as the value of the \`AttributeConsumingServiceIndex\` attribute in a \`\` element. The value of the \`md:AssertionConsumerService/@Location\` attribute in service provider metadata is used by an identity provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue service provider orchestrating a man-in-the-middle attack. Metadata-driven SAML web browser  The following SAML protocol flow is intended to illustrate the use of metadata at various stages of SAML web browser SSO. (See the SAML V2.0 Profiles specification for more information about SAML web browser SSO.) SAML web browser SSO with discovery and login Trusted SAML metadata ensures a secure transaction between a SAML identity provider (IdP) and a SAML service provider (SP). Before metadata, trust information was encoded into the implementation in a proprietary manner. Now the sharing of trust information is facilitated by standard metadata. The SAML 2.0 Metadata Standard provides a well-defined, interoperable metadata format that entities can use to bootstrap the trust process. The following sequence illustrates the use of SAML metadata to drive the SAML protocol flow. =1. Request the target resource at the SP= A browser user requests a web application resource protected by a SAML service provider: https://sp.example.com/myresource If a valid security context for the user principal already exists at the service provider, skip steps 2-13\\\\. =2. Redirect to the Discovery Service= Before the service provider can initiate the SAML protocol flow at step 6, the browser user's preferred identity provider must be known. There are numerous ways to do this. For illustration purposes, the service provider will use a local Discovery Service that conforms to the Identity Provider Discovery Service Protocol and Profile. The service provider redirects the browser user to the Discovery Service: 302 Redirect Location: https://ds.example.com/idpdisc?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.example.org%2Fportal Note that the SP \`entityID\` is included in the redirect URL as specified by the discovery protocol. =3. Request the Discovery Service= The browser user requests the Discovery Service by virtue of the redirect: GET /idpdisc?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.example.org%2Fportal HTTP/1.1 Host: ds.example.com (Discover the user's preferred IdP) The Discovery Service discovers the browser user's preferred identity provider by unspecified means. =4. Redirect to the Discovery Response endpoint at the SP= The Discovery Service now redirects the browser user to a Discovery Response endpoint at the service provider: 302 Redirect Location: https://sp.example.com/SAML2/Login?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.example.org%2Fidp Note that the IdP \`entityID\` is included in the redirect URL as specified by the discovery protocol. =5. Request the Discovery Response endpoint at the SP= The browser user requests the Discovery Response endpoint at the service provider by virtue of the redirect: GET /SAML2/Login?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.example.org%2Fidp HTTP/1.1 Host: sp.example.com The Discovery Response endpoint at the service provider conforms to the Identity Provider Discovery Service Protocol and Profile. =6. Redirect to SSO Service at the IdP= The service provider generates a relevant \`\` element, encodes a SAML Request in an URL query string, and then redirects the browser user to the Single Sign-On Service at the identity provider: 302 Redirect Location: https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState;=token For an outline how to construct the query string, see the corresponding SAML protocol flow in the SAML 2.0 article. Refer to SAMLCore for details. =7. Request the SSO Service at the IdP= The browser user requests the Single Sign-On Service endpoint at the identity provider by virtue of the redirect: GET /SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState;=token HTTP/1.1 Host: idp.example.org =8. Respond with the login page= The identity provider returns a login page to the user's browser. The login page contains an HTML form similar to the following: Username: Password: ... =9. Submit the login form= The browser user submits the HTML form to the identity provider: POST /login-response HTTP/1.1 Host: sp.example.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: nnn username=username&password;=password (Issue a SAML Assertion for the user) At this point, the identity provider knows the identity of the user principal and so the identity provider constructs a SAML Assertion on behalf of the user principal. For a concrete example of such an Assertion, see the corresponding SAML protocol flow in the SAML 2.0 article. As always, refer to SAMLCore for details. The \`\` element in the SAML Assertion encodes an identifier for the user principal. In this case, the identity provider includes a SAML2 Transient NameID (SAMLCore) in the SAML Assertion. The identity provider includes two user attributes in the SAML Assertion: \`eduPersonUniqueId\` and \`mail\`. Operationally, the identity provider digitally signs and encrypts the SAML Assertion, wraps the Assertion in a SAML Response, and then signs the Response object as well. Typically the identity provider signs the Response alone but in this case both the Assertion and the Response are digitally signed. =10. Respond with the SAML Response page= The identity provider returns an XHTML document to the user's browser. The document contains a SAML Response encoded in an XHTML form as follows: ... =11. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP= The XHTML form is automatically submitted by the browser (due to a small bit of JavaScript on the page): POST /SAML2/SSO/POST HTTP/1.1 Host: sp.example.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content- Length: nnn SAMLResponse=response&RelayState;=token =12. Redirect to the target resource= The service provider creates a security context for the user principal and redirects the browser user to the original web application resource: 302 Redirect Location: https://sp.example.com/myresource =13. Request the target resource at the SP again= Finally the browser user requests the target resource at the service provider by virtue of the redirect: https://sp.example.com/myresource =14. Respond with requested resource= Since a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the browser user agent as requested.

History  Abu-Elmagd was born in Mansoura, the capital of Dakahlia Governorate in 1952. In 1976 he obtained his medical degree and trained surgery at the school of medicine Mansoura University. In 1987 earned his PhD in liver diseases and portal hypertensive surgery through a joint collaboration between Emory University in Atlanta and Mansoura University. In 1989, joined University of Pittsburgh to obtain clinical fellowship in transplantation surgery. In 2001, he was promoted to professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1989, he was introduced to the field of organ transplantation by the late professor Thomas E. Starzl. , the father of modern transplantation. after that in 1990, Abu-Elmagd and his colleagues launched an intestinal and multivisceral transplant program which performed more than 450 intestine transplants surgery. As of 2020, Abu-Elmagd is professor of surgery at Case-Western Reserve University and the director of the gut rehabilitation and transplantation center at the Cleveland clinic. With more than 400 peer review scientific publications, as of 2020, his work has been cited close to 20,000 times between 2009 and 2017. = Professional career and contributions = Abu-Elmagd participated in performing the first successful intestinal transplantation under tacrolimus in 1990 at the University of Pittsburgh Later being a participant in the establishment of the clinical utility of tacrolimus in 1991. He was a part of the team which demonstrated the immune-protective effect of the concomitantly transplanted liver and the deleterious effect of DSA on the visceral allograft. His research led to the establishment of Medicare coverage for intestinal and multivisceral transplant in the United States. Abu-Elmagd pioneered or introduced surgical techniques and procedures, for correction of intestinal malrotation in children and adults, replacing the historic Ladd's procedure. Another technique developed by him utilized the patient‚Äôs own gut for the effective management of gut failure, eliminating the need for intravenous nutrition commonly called TPN. An algorithm with a predictive model was established to guide clinicians, health care providers, payers and patients to achieve the best and most cost effective outcome, eliminating the need for gut transplantation. Abu-Elmagd is the founder of the ‚ÄúKareem Abu-Elmagd Transplant and Gut Foundation‚Äù national institute for patient care, clinical training, medical education and research in Egypt. In 2019 he performed an operation free-of-charge for a 24 years old girl, from Bangladesh, who has been suffering severe abdominal pain for a long time, without any known diagnosis, her case needed to reorganize her internal intestines.

The first issue was published by Blue Juice Comics on March 19, 2014. Additional issues have been published on an irregular schedule. In December 2015, the first six issues were collected into a trade paperback. The story is a fantasy adventure about Ariana, a young girl who steals a haunted ship to pursue her dream of being a pirate. Publication history Tim Yates was a nursing student before switching career paths and enrolling at The Kubert School, where he befriended classmate Gavin Smith. When Smith was hired to illustrate The Accelerators for Blue Juice Comics in 2011, he brought Yates along as his colorist. While promoting The Accelerators at the 2012 New York Comic Con, Yates was sketching characters and concepts for Anne Bonnie, a pirate adventure inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones. He was planning to pitch it to Blue Juice publisher Thomas Mumme as a new series, but Mumme approached Yates first to ask for a proposal.Means-Shannon, Hannah (January 23, 2014), \\"From Con Sketch To Full Comic ‚Äì Tim Yates Launches Pirate Adventure Anne Bonnie\\", Bleeding Cool. Retrieved April 15, 2017 Although Anne Bonnie is the first time Yates wrote or drew a comic, most of his previous story ideas had starred a female protagonist. When he began developing a pirate concept, including the historical Anne Bonny was a \\"no-brainer\\" for him. He chose to use a fantasy setting to give himself more freedom in his storytelling. When writing scripts for the story, Yates uses a loose scripting style that allows him to make changes as he's creating the artwork. He draws inspiration from anime and cartoons in his open and colorful line art, which contrasts with more common styles that utilize solid blacks. Once the art is finished, he refines the dialogue to remove redundant exposition and enhance humor.

Tr1 cells regulate tolerance towards antigens of any origin. Tr1 cells are self or non- self antigen specific and their key role is to induce and maintain peripheral tolerance and suppress tissue inflammation in autoimmunity and graft vs. host disease.  Characterization and surface molecules  The specific cell- surface markers for Tr1 cells in humans and mice are CD4+ CD49b+LAG-3+ CD226+ from which LAG-3+ and CD49b+ are indispensable. LAG-3 is a membrane protein on Tr1 cells that negatively regulates TCR-mediated signal transduction in cells. LAG-3 activates dendritic cells (DCs) and enhances the antigen-specific T-cell response which is necessary for Tr1 cells antigen specificity. CD49b belongs to the integrin family and is a receptor for many (extracellular) matrix and non-matrix molecules. CD49b provides only little contribution to the differentiation and function of Tr1 cells. They characteristically produce high levels of IL-10, IFNy, IL-5 and also TGF- Œ≤ but no IL-4 nor IL-2 Production of IL-10 is also much more rapid than its production of other T-helper cell types. Tr1 cells do not constitutively express FOXP3 but only transiently, upon their activation and in smaller amounts than CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory cells.Gregori et al.: Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells: from the bench to the bedside. Journal of Translational Medicine 2012 10(Suppl 3):I7. FOXP3 is not required for Tr1 induction nor for its function. They also express repressor of GATA-3 (ROG), while CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory cells do not. ROG then dowregulates GATA-3, a characteristic transcription factor for Th2 cells. Tr1 cells express high levels of regulatory factors, such as glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), OX40 (CD134), and tumor-necrosis factor receptor (TNFRSF9). Resting human Tr1 cells express Th1 associated chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, and Th2-associated CCR3, CCR4 and CCR8. Upon activation, Tr1 cells migrate preferentially in response to I-309, a ligand for CCR8.  Mechanism of Tr1-mediated suppression  The suppressing and tolerance-inducing effect of Tr1 cells is mediated mainly by cytokines. The other mechanism as cell to cell contact, modulation of dendritic cells, metabolic disruption and cytolysis is however also available to them. In vivo Tr1 cells need to be activated, to be able to exert their regulatory effects. = Mechanisms of suppression = * Cytokines mediated Tr1 cells secrete large amount of suppressing cytokines IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤. IL-10 directly inhibits T cells by blocking its production of IL-2, IFNy and GM-CSF and have tolerogenic effect on B cells and support differentiation of other regulatory T cells. IL-10 indirectly downregulates MHC II molecules and co- stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and force them to upregulate tolerogenic molecules such as ILT-3, ILT-4 and HLA-G. * Cell to cell contact: Type 1 regulatory T cells poses inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 through which they exert suppressor function. * Metabolic disruption: Tr1 cells can express ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 and are suspected of generating adenosine which suppresses effector T cell proliferation and their cytokine production in vitro. * Cytolitic activity: Tr1 cells can both express Granzyme A and granzyme B. It was shown recently, that Tr1 cells, in vitro and also ex vivo, specifically lyse cells of myeloid origin, but not other APC or T or B lymphocytes. Cytolysis indirectly suppresses immune response by reducing numbers of myeloid-origin antigen presenting cells.  Differentiation  Tr 1 cells are inducible, arising from precursors naive T cells. They can be differentiated ex vivo and in vivo. The ways of Tr1 cells induction in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro differ and also envelop many different approaches but the molecular mechanism appears to be conserved. IL-27, together with TGF-Œ≤ induces IL-10‚Äìproducing regulatory T cells with Tr1-like properties cells. IL-27 alone can induce IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, but in the absence of TGF-Œ≤, the cells produce large quantities of both IFN-Œ≥ and IL-10. IL-6 and IL-21 also plays a role in differentiation as they regulate expression of transcription factors necessary for IL-10 production, which is believed to start up the differentiation itself later on. Proposed transcription biomarkers for type 1 regulatory cells differentiation are: * musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma(c-Maf) * the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) * interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) * the repressor of GATA-3 (ROG) * early growth response protein 2 (Egr-2) Expression of these transcriptional factors are driven by IL-6 in IL-21 and IL-2 dependant manner.  Clinical manifestation and application  Tr1 cells possess huge clinical potential in means to prevent, block and even cure several T cells mediated diseases, including GvHD, allograft rejection, autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory diseases. The first successful tests were performed on mouse models and on humans as well. Transplantation research has shown, that donor Tr1 in response to recipient alloantigens, was found to correlate with the absence of GvHD after bone marrow transplantation, while decreased numbers of Tr1 markedly associated with severe GvHD. Decreased levels of IL-10 CD4+ producing cells were also observed in inflamed synovium and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Phase I/II of clinical trials of Tr1 cell treatment concerning Crohn's disease have been successful and appear to be safe and do not lead to a general immune suppression.

Her work often explores the construction of national cultures, their underlying ideologies, political goals and uses, as well as the soft power of the arts, particularly architecture.  Art career  Cibic studied at the Accademia di Bella Arti in Venice, and then took a Masters in Fine Art at Goldsmiths in London, graduating in 2006. In 2013, Cibic represented Slovenia in its Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale, with a project entitled 'For Our Economy and Culture'. This included two films shot at official state locations, One, Framing the Space, was shot at Josep Broz Tito's residence at Lake Bled, where he received royalty and other dignitaries, and dramatised a conversation between state architect Vinko Glanz and a journalist about the uses of national architecture. The other, The Fruit of Our Lands, recreated a Yugoslav parliamentary debate held in 1957 to discuss which artworks might be suitable to 'decorate' the newly built People's Assembly (now the National Assembly Building of Slovenia), designed and built between 1954 and 1959 by Glanz. Cibic told Aesthetica that she found the transcript of this debate - which her film re-enacted word-for-word, and played on a continuous loop - 'in a dank garage within a shopping trolley filled with the archives of the former Yugoslav state architect', and that she had not found any record of it in official state archives. Spielraum: The Nation Loves It (2015), which featured a woman practising a speech to launch a new 'ambitious building programme', also used found dialogue but removed specific names from speeches, referring instead to 'the artist' or 'our country'. The final part of her Spielraum trilogy, Tear Down and Rebuild (2015) was filmed inside the Modernist interior of the former Palace of the Federation building (now the Palace of Serbia) in Belgrade, using quotations pulled from speeches by Ronald Reagan, Prince Charles, Benito Mussolini, Margaret Thatcher and others, as well as architectural theory and Yugoslav debates, for its dialogue. The Pavilion (2015) was a short, experimental documentary about the (Serbian, Croatian and Slovene) Kingdom of Yugoslavia's Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo '29). The Yugoslav entry, designed by Serbian modernist architect Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan, supposedly won the Grand Prix and then lost it to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's design for Germany due to political intrigue. In the video, a narrator described Cibic's methods to retrace the lost Pavilion, which was torn down after the end of Expo '29, as five performers built a model of Bra≈°ovan's star-shaped building in 1:7 scale.

FTA is slang for F___ The Army. The Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM) was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the Camp Pendleton Marine Base in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times., it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the House Committee on Internal Security (formerly HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group's name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall. Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975. Founding MDM started at the civilian supported Green Machine antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton.Oceanside Chamber of Commerce History of Oceanside It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called GI's Against Fascism and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton. The San Diego group already had a newspaper called Duck Power and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called Attitude Check whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was \\"written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em\\" (\\"snuffy\\", \\"grunt\\" and \\"em\\" were common slang names for enlisted marines). The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14 in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by Donald W. Duncan, Captain Howard Levy, Angela Davis and a number of active duty GIs.Wisconsin Historical Society GI Press Collection: Attitude Check Preamble and 12 Demands At this rally, MDM's spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of Duck Power and Attitude Check. The Preamble stated \\"that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights\\" and pledged \\"support for the self-determination of all peoples.\\" It ended, \\"We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer.\\" The 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, \\"human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women,\\" the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of \\"mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training\\", doing away with the \\"court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems,\\" \\"wages equal to the federal minimum wage,\\" \\"the abolition of the class structure of the military,\\" an end to \\"all racism everywhere,\\" the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton,\\" an end to \\"the glorification of war,\\" and the abolition of the draft.MDM Preamble and 12 Demands Spread =San Diego= The pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called GI's Against Fascism merged with the group at Camp Pendleton. They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, Duck Power in San Diego and Attitude Check at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to Dare to Struggle which they continued to publish until mid-1971. Attitude Check's last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment. The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the San Diego Free Press which helped them put out their newspapers. =Great Lakes Naval Station= By early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the Great Lakes naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors. They began publishing The Navy Times Are Changing which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year \\"drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians.\\" When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000. =San Francisco Bay Area= Tom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded GI's Against Fascism in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at Fort Ord near Monterey, CA which published the Right-On Post from May to August 1970.Right-on Post And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the Alameda Naval Air Station, Treasure Island, San Francisco and other military bases, which published their newspaper Up Against the Bulkhead regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until 1975. The Up Against the Bulkhead paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the USS Coral Sea organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship.1961‚Äì1973: GI resistance in the Vietnam WarStatement from Peter Wiley, Up Against the Bulkhead Staff member This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.Up Against the Bulkhead =El Toro Marine Air Base= In July 1970 another chapter formed at the El Toro Marine air base in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called Pay Back consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.Pay Back =Fort Carson= In mid-1970 a group of GI from the Fort Carson army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called Counter Attack. They were supported by the Homefront GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.Counter Attack Rules MDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict Rules for MDM Members. These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.Rules for MDM Members Controversy Some critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented \\"would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force.\\" In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general Leonard F. Chapman Jr. said MDM was \\"a serious threat to the defense of this country.\\" =House Internal Security Committee= The House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement \\"is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement.\\" A witness before the committee described MDM's efforts at Fort Ord as follows: > The general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize > them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold > demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the > establishment, to conduct ... certain operations aimed at distributing > propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to > disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a > military training base. =Other Views= Other observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable. One scholar observed that MDM viewed \\"the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam War was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups.\\" The Stanford Daily viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: \\"These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed.\\" =Radicalism= MDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 Right-on Post newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: > The goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of > their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. > Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle > together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will > break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been > there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force > of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. > military monster.Right-on Post August 1970 p. 12 Harassment, Attacks and Police Infiltration Several of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the Green Machine coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected. Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol > \\"smashed down the door of a San Diego store front ... to break up a peaceful > meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians.\\" This was preceded by \\"several > hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military > police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and > GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested > on non-existent charges.\\"MDM Press Release John Paul Murray Agent Trading Card - The Door 25Jan1973 The San Diego MDM chapter was reported to have been infiltrated by as many as four undercover police agents during 1970, including San Diego Policemen Randy Curtis and John Paul Murray. Murray achieved a considerable amount of local notoriety when he was exposed as an agent because he had become one of the leading members of San Diego MDM. He had gained a reputation for advocating more militant and sometimes illegal actions, including inciting violent confrontations with the police and supplying weapons to the Oceanside MDM chapter. He was even accused of attempting to talk some local activists into blowing up the San Diego - Coronado Bridge. Several women supporters of MDM accused the married Murray of lying to and sleeping with them. One member of the San Diego chapter of the antiwar group Concerned Officers Movement recalled Murray being so convincing as the committed antiwar activist that he ironically helped convince him to file as a conscientious objector. There were so many undercover agents infiltrating antiwar and activist organizations that from 1972 to 1973 the San Diego underground newspaper The Door published eleven Undercover Agent Trading Cards, each showing a different police agent.https://voices.revealdigital.org/?a=q&hs;=1&r;=1&results;=1&txq;=%22Agent+Trading+Cards%22&dafdq;=&dafmq;=&dafyq;=&datdq;=&datmq;=&datyq;=&puq;=&txf;=txIN&ssnip;=txt&e;=------197-en-20 --1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Agent+Trading%22--------------1, The Door, Undercover Agent Trading Cards In 1978, the Los Angeles Times published a list of almost 200 organizations that had been under surveillance during the early 1970s by the Los Angeles Police Department. One of these was the Movement for a Democratic Military. Legacy MDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities. Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self- determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.

Observation history  The location of NGC 5617 in the sky It was discovered by James Dunlop in 1826. He described it on May 8, 1826 as \\"a cluster of small stars of mixed magnitudes, considerably congregated towards the centre, 4' or 5' in diametre\\" and added it to his catalog as number 302. John Herschel described as \\"Class IV object, very rich; irregularly round; pretty much compressed in the middle but scattered at borders; 15'; there are three stars of 10th magnitude, 5 or 6 stars of 11th magnitude; the rest below 11th\\" and added it to General Catalogue as No. 3570. In the New General Catalogue it is described as \\"large (10'), richer in stars to the west (about 80 total), with a compressed middle. It contains stars of magnitude 8 and fainter.\\"  Characteristics  NGC 5617 is located nearly 2 kpc (6.500 light years) away from Earth, at the further border of Carina- Sagittarius arm. Various photometric studies have yield different results concerning the age and the distance of the cluster; Moffat & Vogt (1975) studied and calculated a distance of 1.34 kpc from the Sun, Haug (1978) found its distance to be 1.82 kpc, a CCD photometry by Kjeldsen & Frandsen (1991) found the distance to be 2.05 ¬± 0.2 kpc and the age 70 Myr and Carra & Munari (2004) used BVI photometry to obtain reddening EB‚àíV= 0.48 ¬± 0.05, age of 80 Myr, and a distance of 2.0 ¬± 0.3 kpc. De Silva et al. (2015) calculated its distance at 2.1 ¬± 0.3 kpc. There are 175 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 65 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 7.4 - 10.2 parsecs (24 - 33 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5617, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. One blue straggler is possible member of the cluster. Possible members of the cluster are also a delta Scuti variable, a gamma Doradus variable and eclipsing variable stars. = Relation with Trumpler 22 = NGC 5617 appears to be gravitationally bound to Trumpler 22.

She founded a school to encourage young naturalists and published in both scientific journals and the popular press. Family and education Marcelle Gauvreau was born in Rimouski, Quebec, to Joseph Gauvreau, a physician, and Augustine L'Arriv√©e. When Marcelle was two, her father became registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Quebec in Montreal, and the family moved to that city. Marcelle was the aunt and godmother of the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Gauvreau received her early education at the Saint- Urbain Academy, Boulevard Academy, and the convent of Mont-Sainte-Marie. When she was ten, she came down with polio, which left her with a weak leg and caused her to miss half a year of schooling. In 1924, at the age of 17, she contracted tuberculosis, which left her with health issues for the rest of her life. Gauvreau attended the University of Montreal for one year (1929-30). In 1930, the newspaper Le Devoir, encouraged by the prominent botanist Marie- Victorin Kirouac, launched a botanical contest. Gauvreau, who had already begun developing an interest in botany, entered the contest with a herbarium, which was considered excellent by the contest judges but excluded from the prizes because Gauvreau was then enrolled in the arts and philosophy division of the university rather than the natural sciences. The following year, Gauvreau moved over to the Botanical Institute for further study under Kirouac, who considered her one of the most brilliant students in the school. She got her degree in botany in 1932, and a degree in natural sciences the following year. During this same period, she worked in the Botanical Institute library, and she earned a degree in library science from McGill University in 1935. In 1933, she began graduate work on the marine algae of the St. Lawrence River under Jules Brunel. She obtained her M.S. in 1939, and her thesis was published in 1956. During her graduate studies, she also completed an exhaustive bibliography of Kirouac's writings and worked on the glossary and index of his magnum opus, La flore laurentienne (The Laurentian Flora), the first comprehensive record of all plant species indigenous to southern Quebec. Career =Circles of Young Naturalists= In the 1930s, Gauvreau became involved with a new organization, the Circles of Young Naturalists (CYN), founded to encourage young scientists and supported by the Canadian Society for Natural History (CSNH). In 1932, she became the editor of a weekly chronicle of CYN activities published in the youth magazine L'Oiseau bleu. She continued there until the magazine folded in 1940. Between 1938 and 1954, she also wrote a weekly column about the CYN in Le Devoir. From 1938 to 1950, she was an officer of the CYN, and in 1956, she was elected president of the CSNH. =The School of Awakening= Around 1935, Gauvreau founded a unique educational institution, the School of Awakening (L'√âcole de l'√âveil). Much as with the CYN, the goal was to awaken promising primary-school students to the natural sciences. Students attended for one hour a week, and the emphasis was on developing observational and field-work skills through direct contact with living plants and animals. From 1939 to 1957, classes were held at the Montreal Botanical Garden. Following a disagreement with city authorities, Gauvreau decided to move the school into the Cardinal-L√©ger Institute. Subsequently, several more branches were opened around the city and its suburbs. By 1960, more than 3500 students had passed through the school. =Radio and television= In 1943, Gauvreau had a radio program for young children on which she told stories about the natural world using the pseudonym \\"La F√©e des fleurs\\" (Fairy of the Flowers). In 1963-1964, she was associated with the television series \\"Wonders of Nature\\". =Publications= Gauvreau published extensively, writing for both scientific journals and the popular press. Her works include two books for children on Canadian flora and fauna, her thesis on marine algae, and over 250 articles mainly for children. Legacy The Marcelle-Gauvreau Ecological Reserve in Quebec was named in her honor. References Further reading *Chauvette, Louise.

Because his father has recently died, his mother's sister, the conservative Aunt Rose, agrees to help take care of Ulysses and his brother while their mother is at work. Ulysses is bullied at school by his classmates and threatened at home by Rose for his feminine characteristics. One night Ulysses ventures out into the city and meets a group of transgender and gay individuals, Ebony, Dijon, Raymond, and Heaven. Ebony invites Ulysses to Saturday Church, a program run at a church every Saturday to feed and provide shelter for LGBT youths. While there Ulysses develops an interest in voguing and buys a pair of high-heel shoes to practice in. Ulysses also begins to form a relationship with Raymond, who has mutual feelings for him. After returning home from school one day, Aunt Rose is waiting for Ulysses and confronts him about the high-heels, which she discovered in his room. Rose begins to beat Ulysses, causing him to run away from the house. Ulysses attempts to go to Saturday Church for help, but as it is Wednesday, none of his friends are there.

She was the founder and principal promoter of the Illinois Woman's Press Association (IWPA). Early years and education Frances Augusta Hemingway was born in West Burlington, New York, December 23, 1842. Her parents were Curtis and Martha R. Hemingway. She was educated in the western part of the State and in Brooklyn. In early girlhood, she became a contributor to New York publications. Career In 1864, in Brooklyn, she married Claudius W. Conant, of New York. After 1892, Conant became a resident of Chicago, Illinois. She usually passed the winters in traveling through the South. She was for several years a special correspondent of the Living Church and a contributor to the Advance and other religious publications of Chicago, as well as to some journals, and, occasionally, short stories of hers appeared in leading New York City and Philadelphia publications. During the World Cotton Centennial of 1884‚Äì85, she was the only special woman correspondent in New Orleans for a mechanical and scientific journal, ably representing the \\"Industrial World,\\" of Chicago. She often wrote as a collaborator with her husband, who was connected with the American Field, and they frequently did editorial work interchangeably. Conant is an earnest advocate of the cause of industrial education, and she was editor and business manager of the \\"Journal of Industrial Education\\" in the early days of its publication. Her reputation as a writer of short sketches of travel lead to an engagement as editor of the American Traveler and Tourist, published in Chicago, which position she held for two years, until she became interested in a commercial enterprise. Though rarely working in any associations, she developed ability as a promoter and organizer. Following up on an idea of Marion A. McBride of The Boston Post during the World Cotton Centennial, Conant and Dr. Julia Holmes Smith helped found the IWPA, and Conant was the principal promoter of the IWPA, the first independent State organization for the purpose of affording practical assistance to women in literary pursuits. She was secretary of that association for the first two years, and received an honorary life membership in recognition of her services. Conant was noted for being generous in giving time and thought to all appeals for help. Like many women in public work, she became the constant recipient of touching appeals from other women, usually those without technical training, for assistance to occupations by which they could earn a living. She became oppressed by the problem: \\"What shall we do with this unskilled army?\\" When a plan for employing large numbers of these untrained applicants was presented to Conant she withdrew from editorial work, in 1891, to engage in the promotion and organization of a corporation projected to give, eventually, remunerative employment to thousands of women in all parts of the country. She was secretary of the company during its first year and took an active part in the business management, then she resigned her trust to others, having made a record of phenomenal success. The year closed with the company well established. She died April 28, 1903 in Cook County, Illinois.\\"Illinois, Cook County Deaths, 1878‚Äì1994,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N72C-B2H : 17 May 2016), Francis Augusta Conant, 28 Apr 1903; citing , Cook, Illinois, United States, source reference cn 2554, record number 98, Cook County Courthouse, Chicago; FHL microfilm 1,239,686.

He was born at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and died by drowning in the Ingogo river in the retreat from the Battle of Schuinshoogte in the First Boer War in South Africa. Wilkinson was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, though he appears to have left Cambridge University without taking a degree. As a right-handed lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper, he played in the Eton v Harrow match in both 1871 and 1872, captaining the side in the second year. At Cambridge, he was given three matches for the University side, and was wicketkeeper in at least one of them, perhaps all three, but made little impression as a batsman. His only innings of any length was an unbeaten 22 for the Gentlemen of the MCC against Kent in 1873: he also played in the same 12-a-side fixture in 1875. Wilkinson left Cambridge University in the summer of 1873 after only a year and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, being promoted to lieutenant later the same year. He was adjutant of the 3rd battalion from 1875 and fought at the Battle of Gingindlovu in the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa in 1879. Less than two years later, he was back fighting in South Africa and died in the aftermath of the Battle of Schuinshoogte; the newspaper report of the battle indicated that he was attempting to cross the flooded river to bring aid to wounded men from his battalion when he drowned.

A teacher in her early career, she served as superintendent of schools in Knox County, Illinois, being one of the first women to fill such a position in Illinois. An active supporter of the temperance movement, West served as president of the Illinois Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and editor of the national paper, Union Signal. Her other roles within the WCTU included superintendent of the Training School for Temperance Workers, Illinois State Superintendent of Temperance in Schools of Higher Education, as well as Stockholder, Director, and Secretary of the Woman's Publication Association. She was the first president of the Illinois Woman's Press Association, member of the Chicago Woman's Club, director of the Protective Agency for Women and Children. West was the author of Childhood: Its Care and Culture (1892). She died in Japan while training temperance workers in organization and promotion reform efforts. Early years and education Mary Allen West was born in Galesburg, Illinois, July 13, 1837; she was the first child born in this city. Her parents were among the founders of Knox College, one of the earliest collegiate institutions in the Mississippi Valley. The parents hailed from New York and founded Galesburg, with George Washington Gale, Sylvanus Ferris, and Thomas Simmons. West was a healthy, vigorous, studious child who matured early, both mentally and physically. She passed the examinations that qualified her to enter Knox Female Seminary at age 13, then taught for two years until she was old enough to enter. She then graduated at 17. Career =Educator= Immediately after graduation, she began to teach school, which she then believed to be her life work. Successful in teaching and influential in educational circles, West earned a reputation as a \\"lady of grit, grace, and gumption.\\" Despite refusing to run for the position, she was elected to the office of superintendent of schools in Knox County, Illinois in 1873. This made her one of the first women to fill such a position in Illinois. She served in that capacity for nine years and resigned on accepting the presidency of the Illinois WCTU. She attended many educational conventions and was a power in them, and continually wrote for school and other journals. She thus showed herself to have the capacity for almost unlimited hard work. Home duties were at that time pressing heavily, including as they did the care and nursing of an invalid mother and sister. She occupied a prominent social position, and her work included Sunday-school teaching. =Journalist and editor= When the American Civil War broke out, she worked earnestly in organizing women into aid societies to assist the Sanitary Commission. Her first editorial work was at long range, as she edited in Illinois the Home Magazine, which was published nearly away, in Philadelphia. Later, she left writing for active work in the temperance movement throughout the State. When the woman's crusade sounded the call of woman, and after the organization of the WCTU, she became an earnest worker in the cause. She assisted in organizing the women of Illinois, and in a short time, became their State president. In that office, she traveled very extensively throughout Illinois and became familiar with the homes of the people. She wrote scores of leaflets and pamphlets, all strong and terse, including \\"Our Toiling Children\\" with Florence Kelley. Other leaflets included \\"Organization\\", \\"Gospel Meetings, Band of Hope, Temperance Literature:, \\"Scientific Temperance Literature\\", and \\"Temperance in Public Schools\\". While she was State president of the WCTU, she was often called upon to \\"help out\\" in the editorial labors of Mary Bannister Willard, the editor of the Union Signal, published in Chicago. Later, it was merged with Our Union, becoming the Union Signal, under the editorship of Willard. During this time, she also served as the superintendent of the Training School for Temperance Workers, Illinois State Superintendent of Temperance in Schools of Higher Education, as well as Stockholder, Director, and Secretary of the Woman's Publication Association. Before Willard went to Germany to reside, West removed to Chicago, and accepted the position of editor-in-chief, with Mrs. Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew as her assistant. As editor of that paper, the organ of the national and the world's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, her responsibilities were immense, but they were carried well. She met the demands of her enormous constituency in a remarkable degree. A paper having a circulation of nearly 100,000 women, needed judicious and strong, as well as thorough and comprehensive, editing. This the Union Signal had, and the women of the WCTU repeatedly, in the most emphatic manner, endorsed West's policy and conduct of the paper. =Childhood: Its Care and Culture= Childhood: Its Care and Culture (1892) While serving as Illinois state president of the WCTU, and traveling throughout the state, the knowledge she gained of the inner life of thousands of homes, together with her intimate studies of children in the schoolroom, efficiently supplemented her natural bias for the task of writing her book for mothers, Childhood, its Care and Culture. It was published by the Woman's Temperance Association of Chicago in 1892. In it, the author claimed that the book \\"has grown naturally out of the rich soil of a thousand homes,\\" which was interpreted to mean that the author wrote from experience and observation and not from mere theory. The contents were varied, including chapters on the child's body, babyhood, childhood, boyhood and girlhood, children's rights, work and play, amusements, behavior, domestic economy, family government, practical health hints, and other topics. There were also a number of illustrations, and, interspersed among the reading matter, were songs set to music, suitable for the nursery and the home. The book was an octavo of 722 pages, including a copious index. It was pervaded by strong Christian and temperance sentiment, the author holding that the growth in a child of a true and healthy religious and physical life was greatly to be desired and sought after, not only for its own sake, but for the general well being of society. On the various practical questions coming under treatment, the views set forth were characterized as sound and sensible. The variety and range of topics almost invited the remark that some at least must suffer from superficial or hackneyed treatment, but the author appeared to have labored conscientiously and carefully over each section, and to have brought together many wise thoughts and counsels for the benefit of those who really desire guidance and help in the care and nurture of children. =Illinois Woman's Press Association= Soon after she went to Chicago to reside, some Chicago women, both writers and publishers, organized the Illinois Woman's Press Association. Its avowed purpose was to provide a means of communication between woman writers, and to secure the benefits resulting from organized effort West was made president, and is now filling the position for the fifth consecutive annual term. Her work in that sphere has been a unifying one. She has brought into harmony many conflicting elements, and has helped to carry the association through the perils which always beset the early years of an organization. She has been a wise and practical leader, inaugurating effective branches of work, which have been of great value to the association. Personal life She was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club, and an effective director of the Protective Agency for Women and Children, but the strain of that work proved too great, and she has stepped outside its directorship, although remaining an ardent upholder of the agency. Her heart was in her Galesburg home, the home of her childhood and youth, and when she allowed herself a holiday, it was to spend a few days there. West, in 1892, visited California, the Sandwich Islands, and Japan in the interests of temperance work, arriving in Yokohama in September. She died in Japan before the end of the year, and is buried in Hope Cemetery, Galesburg.

He had earlier in his career fought and been badly wounded at the Action of 31 July 1793 off the coast of New Jersey. Life Kerr was born in 1770, the son of Robert Kerr, a Royal Navy lieutenant. In 1781 was joined the navy himself as midshipman on board the frigate HMS Endymion, commanded by Captain James Gambier and from there served in a number of other vessels, including a period on HMS Boreas under Captain Horatio Nelson. In 1790 he was promoted to lieutenant and joined first HMS Narcissus and then the frigate HMS Boston under Captain George Courtenay.Gentleman's Magazine, Captain A. R. Kerr, CB Boston was assigned to the American Station at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and on 31 July 1793 challenged the French frigate Embuscade, then anchored in New York City to combat. Captain Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart obliged, and the frigates battled for several hours off the coast of Navesink, New Jersey. In the engagement Boston took severe damage and Courtenay was killed. Kerr himself was badly wounded, struck in the shoulder by grape-shot and blinded in one eye by flying splinters. The surviving British officers managed to extract Boston from the action before the damage became fatal, and later withdrew to St John's, Newfoundland.Woodman, p. 30 After his recovery, Kerr served in HMS Repulse and HMS Clyde, fighting in the latter at the Action of 20 August 1799, for which he was commended by Captain Charles Cunningham. In 1802 at the start of the Napoleonic Wars he was promoted to commander and served in HMS Diligence and HMS Combatant at the blockade of Boulogne. In 1806 he was promoted to captain and from 1808 took a series of temporary commissions as commander of the ships of the line HMS Tigre, HMS Valiant and HMS Revenge in the Channel Fleet, then commanded by his old captain, now Lord Gambier. In April 1809, Revenge was heavily engaged at the Battle of Basque Roads, in which a French fleet was driven ashore at the mouth of the Charente River and partially destroyed. The engagement was particularly notable for a bitter dispute which subsequently arose between Gambier and the commander of the inshore squadron, Captain Lord Cochrane, after the latter publicly accused the former of incompetence in his conduct during the battle. Kerr was called as a witness for the defence during Gambier's ensuing court-martial, at which the admiral was acquitted. Kerr then took command of HMS Ganymede, HMS Unicorn and then HMS Esperance, engaged in anti-privateer patrols and convoying of East India cargo. In 1811 he assumed command of his last ship, HMS Acasta, operating against American privateers in the War of 1812 until the peace in 1815, when he retired from active service. He was initiated as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in appreciation for his service, and died at Stonehouse, Plymouth in 1831, survived by his wife Charlotte and seven children.

It received mostly positive reception from critics, who praised its gameplay and story while criticizing its poor localization.  Gameplay  Members of the player's team control giant mechs known as GEARs that can be leveled up and upgraded over the course of the game. Each GEAR is elementally aligned, which bestows upon them certain special abilities. The game's battles take place on an overhead grid, and are turn-based. Terrain also plays a role, with different types of terrain having different effects. The GEAR pilots also have a \\"will\\" stat that determines their power and can rise and fall depending on whether the actions they make align with their personalities. The game has over 50 campaign missions, some able to have multiple results depending on what the player does.  Plot  The game takes place in a science fantasy setting, where two warring nations, Wefradian and Kradion, have gone to war over food shortages. The main character is Luke Bradferd, a Wefradian knight who pilots a giant robot called a GEAR. His GEAR becomes damaged and he is forced to stop in a small village, but it gets destroyed by enemy forces, and its inhabitants are kidnapped. He rescues a young woman named Tiana, and flees the town, meeting up with the rest of his military unit. In the course of the game, Luke and his unit discover an evil conspiracy behind the war and end up having to save the world.  Reception  The game's HD version received positive reception from critics, with an aggregate score of 83/100 on Metacritic. Bryan Grosnick of RPGFan rated the original version of the game 82/100, calling the story clich√©d and poorly localized but that it was still one of the best SRPGs on the iPhone and an \\"excellent value\\". Jared Nelson of TouchArcade rated the HD version 80/100, calling the battles \\"excellent\\" and the story \\"compelling\\". Will Wilson of Pocket Gamer rated the HD version 6/10, calling the game \\"tedious\\" and \\"plodding\\" despite its \\"interesting battle mechanics\\".  Origin  The game is a copy of the game \\"Battle of the Youstrass\\" from 2001 created by Team Darkland.

Controversy The monument is located on land given by the county government to the United Daughters of the Confederacy as a \\"park for white people\\". , the town square is still owned by UDC, although the city of Tuskegee maintains it as a public space. When the monument was erected in 1906, the county population was 82% African-American. Per the 2010 United States Census, the city of Tuskegee is 97% African-American. In 1966, after an all-white jury acquitted the killer of Civil Rights worker Samuel Younge Jr., there was an unsuccessful attempt to tear the monument down; it was defaced with \\"Black Power\\" and a yellow stripe down its back. It was vandalized with spray paint in 2015 and on October 11, 2017; after the latest incident the United Daughters of the Confederacy, its owner, decided not to clean it, \\"out of fear it would only be repeated\\". In 2015, Mayor Johnny Ford sought to relocated the Confederate statue to the Tuskegee cemetery. According to Dyann Robinson, president of the Tuskegee Historic Preservation Commission, \\"it would probably take a bomb to get it down\\". In June 2020, the statue was again vandalized with graffiti. The city covered the base with tarpaulins, and was looking into a way to legally have the statue removed and relocated.

This accident occurred during the morning rush hour just south of the current Secaucus Junction station. It is NJ Transit's deadliest accident to date and was the first in which NJ Transit passengers and crew died. 3 people were killed and 162 others sustained injuries.  Background  The trains involved in the accident were Trains #1254 and #1107. = Train #1254 = Train #1254 had departed Waldwick at 8:03 a.m. EST, about 5 minutes later than the 7:58 a.m. departure time. The train would make stops at Ho Ho Kus, Ridgewood, Radburn Fair Lawn, Broadway Fair Lawn, Plauderville , Garfield, Rutherford, and Harmon Cove. The train's final stop was supposed to be Hoboken Terminal with an arrival expected at 8:44 a.m. The engineer was John J. DeCurtis with conductor Stephen Miller as well as an unnamed assistant conductor. Train #1254 consisted of one Comet II cab car (#5146), 4 trailer Comet I cars, and a GP40PH-2 #4110. Train #1254 made all stops on the Bergen County Line except Glen Rock Boro Hall; the train also made a stop at Harmon Cove (it was replaced by Secaucus Junction by 2003). At the time of the collision, the train had over 250 passengers aboard.\\"NEAR HEAD-ON COLLISION AND DERAILMENT OF TWO NEW JERSEY TRANSIT COMMUTER TRAINS NEAR SECAUCUS, NEW JERSEY FEBRUARY 9, 1996\\" National Transportation Safety Board = Train #1107 = Train #1107, headed for Suffern, had departed Hoboken Terminal at 8:31 a.m. EST, about one minute late. Train #1107 was operated by engineer Alfonso Debonis, as well as an unnamed conductor and assistant conductor. #1107 consisted of GP40PH-2 #4148, 5 Comet I trailer cars, and one Comet I cab car (#5120), at the time of the collision. The train had 125 passengers as well as 2 deadheading NJT employees who were traveling to Suffern so they could operate another train that originated there. Both trains were running in push-pull configuration.  Accident  Train #1254 had left Harmon Cove station at 8:33 a.m. with 275 passengers and accelerated to 53 mph. Meanwhile Train #1107 departed Hoboken at 8:31 a.m. with 125 passengers aboard. Train #1254 soon passed a medium approach position light signal telling the train to slow down, according to black box data the train passed this signal at 34 mph, the next signal would show the engineer a stop indication at Bergen Junction to wait for Train #1107 to pass before Train #1254 would be allowed to continue to Hoboken. Train #1254 continued to slow until about 71 feet before the stop indication position signal, the engineer then accelerated the train to 20 mph past the red signal light. Shortly afterward the train went into emergency braking after the engineer realized his mistake. Several moments earlier, Train #1107 had been shown a clear signal and was approaching the western end of Bergen Junction at 53 mph, the track speed for that section was 60 mph. Train #1254 was moving at 18 mph when the collision occurred, passenger accounts on Train #1254 describe the sound of the brakes and the blaring of the train horn moments before the collision. Cab Car #5146 was ripped open in the collision, killing the engineer John J. DeCurtis, and Arthur David Stern, a passenger aboard train #1254. Locomotive #4148's roof collapsed in on the cab on impact thereby killing Engineer Alfonso Debonis instantly. In addition, 162 passengers were injured. = Fatalities = There were three fatalities: * John J. DeCurtis, 59, lived on Staten Island, was the engineer of train #1254 and had been an engineer for 40 years. * Arthur David Stern, 49, lived in Fair Lawn, was a lawyer in New York City. He was the only passenger who died. * Alfonso Debonis, 47, lived in Hasbrouck Heights, was the engineer of train #1107, employed by NJ Transit Rail Operations for 7 years, was promoted to engineer in 1990.  Aftermath  The accident was the New York City area's worst train accident since the 1958 Newark Bay rail accident. Following the accident Comet II cab car #5146 was scrapped, while GP40PH-2 #4110, and Comet I cab car #5120 continued to be in service. One year later, In 1997, GP40PH-2 #4148 was rebuilt, and put back in service as #4219 following the rebuild. = Emergency response = The New Jersey Transit Police Department was notified at 8:40 am and arrived at the accident site 13 minutes later. Other emergency services arrived within about 10 to 20 minutes after the first several 911 calls were made. = NJ Transit response = The conductor of train #1254 was able to evacuate all passengers of the train with the help of the assistant conductor. The conductor aboard train #1107 was reported to be visibly upset, repeatedly crying that \\"people are dead\\" which also worried many passengers, the 2 deadheading NJ Transit employees helped evacuate the train instead. After the evacuation, the remaining crew members stood watch to flag down any oncoming trains. Both crews abroad both trains did not use the public address system to communicate with passengers, they instead went from car to car yelling for passengers to exit the train. The assistant conductor aboard train #1254 later reported that he did not know if the public address system was working or not, so he did not use it. The conductor aboard train #1107 could not recall if the system worked or not. Throughout the evacuation process, both train crews communicated by hand held radio. The accident was first reported by the engineer of an eastbound NJ Transit train on the Main Line at 8:45 am.

The company was created through the merger of two smaller forges to produce rails for the Nord railway company. After World War II it was merged with other companies in 1948 to form Usinor. Origins The Soci√©t√© Serret, Leli√®vre et Cie was constituted in 1834 to build and run the Forges de Denain. The partners were Georges Serret, Isidore Charpentier-Odolant and Charles Leli√®vre. Pierre Fran√ßois Dumont also participated. Serret and Dumont were also partners in the Forges de Raismes (Renaux, Dumant et Cie). The factory in Denain was located beside the Escaut river, which had been canalized between Valenciennes and Cambrai since 1775. The docks on the river were owned by the Compagnie des Mines d'Anzin, a coal mining operation, apart from one quay used by the steel factory. The Mines d'Anzin operated three coal mines below the factory. The first coke-fired blast furnaces of the Forges de Denain began operations in 1836. In 1834 Beno√Æt Vasseur, using external capital, asked for permission to build an iron factory at Anzin similar to that at Denain. Due to lack of money, Vasseur was unable to build a blast furnace and built only a forge and puddling furnaces. In 1842 he sold the business, the Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin, to the Soci√©t√© de Commerce de Bruxelles, a subsidiary of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique. This was a major bank associated with the Rothschilds that worked with L√©on Talabot in the Nord. Both the Denain and Anzin companies had little difficulty training their workers, since there was a long history of mining and industry in the region. Construction of the Chemins de Fer du Nord drove the integration of small forges into rolling mills to supply rails. The Compagnie du chemin de fer du Nord was unable to import Belgian rails in 1846. To obtain a better supply, in 1849 the Talabots took control of the Denain and Anzin forges and merged them. Talabot combined the Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin with the Serret, Leli√®vre, Dumont et Cie company of Denain to form the Soci√©t√© des hauts-fourneaux et des forges de Denain et Anzin, the largest metallurgical company in the Nord Department. Pre-World War I Denain forges, canal in foreground Talabot managed Denain- Anzin after the merger. Georges Serret, who died in 1854, retained an important stake in the company. His second daughter married Hippolyte Waternau, an advocate, who became an administrator of the company. In 1849 Denain-Anzin had capital of 10 million francs. At the time of the merger there was no blast furnace at Anzin, while the Denain factory had three. By 1854 Denain-Anzin had five blast furnaces, of which two were in Anzin. A difficult period for the manufacturers of the north of France began in 1860, which they blamed entirely on the free-trade Cobden‚ÄìChevalier Treaty signed at the start of the year. In fact the problem was largely caused by depletion of local iron ore, which was causing the cost of production to rise fast. The imports from Britain and Belgium were not enough to be a significant threat to the iron industry, and imports of cheap coal and coke would have helped. In 1860 the Inspector-General of Mines, Charles Combes, wrote to the Minister of Commerce that the real goal of the Comite des Forges, of which Leon Talabot of Denain- Anzin was president, was to maintain the price of iron by using any arguments of threats they thought would work. In 1863 Hippolyte Waternau became director. Waternau was president of the Conf√©rence Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. He introduced sisters of that charity to run several services for Denain-Anzin. Unlike the nearby coal mines, the demand for steel fluctuated widely, and until 1872 the company's finances were shaky. In the crisis of 1866‚Äì68 the company came close to bankruptcy, and was forced to lay off workers at both plants. In 1870 the company became a Soci√©t√© Anonyme. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870 the company was unable to pay its workers in cash, but instead paid in vouchers on the company's food store. Paulin Talabot became president in 1872. In 1878 the company was part of a syndicate that obtain the Godbrange concession, and in 1890 obtained part of the neighboring Tiercelet concession. In 1879 Senelle-Maubeuge and Denain-Anzin bought the C√¥te-Rouge mining properties. In 1886 Senelle-Maubeuge and Denain-Anzin acquired the Jarny concession. In 1896 Robert de Nervo became chairman of the Denain-Anzin iron works, which he began to modernise. The Nervo family would make Denain- Anzin the fifth-largest steel producer in France by 1913. In 1902 Denain-Anzin started up a new steelworks using the Thomas process, the Aci√©rie Jordan, the largest in the Nord. This was one of the largest and most efficient Thomas steel mills in the country. Pit 1 of the Compagnie des mines d'Azincourt The company absorbed the Compagnie des Charbonnages d'Azincourt on 12 July 1906 to ensure a supply of affordable coal. Denain-Anzin delayed electrification until about 1913, since the change required conversion of all its steam-based power plants. In the fifteen years before World War I (1914‚Äì18) the company invested 75 million francs. In 1913 Denain-Anzin produced 390,000 tons of steel, or 7.68% of total French steel production. The company produced only 17,000 tons of iron due to low demand and low profitability. In 1913 the company was the 17th largest publicly held manufacturing enterprise in France, and 8th largest primary metals company with assets of 64.1 million francs. The largest steel company, Marine et Homecourt, had assets of 120.7 million francs. World War I Denain-Anzin blast furnaces In 1917 the Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid and the Soci√©t√© des Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the Boukhadra deposits in Algeria, which was supported by the minister Albert Thomas. However, the administration of Algerian governor Charles Lutaud submitted an alternative proposal to the government that required the company to build blast furnaces in B√¥ne and to pay higher royalties to Algeria. The agreement and specifications for this project were signed early in 1918, with 85% of the capital supplied by Mokta and Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen, and 15% by Denain-Anzin and a consortium of Algerian banks. Two blast furnaces would be built with combined annual capacity of 80,000 tons. However, after Charles Jonnart returned to Algeria as governor the project was delayed and eventually cancelled. Later history The war damages act of 1919 took little account of the age of the facilities that had been destroyed. For Nord-Est, which had 80% new plant in 1914, it was a disaster. For Denain-Anzin, it was a boon, since obsolete plant could be replaced. The Denain factory was built in 1920 to produce rather more than 500,000 tons of steel per year, and would achieve a record of 2,419,631 tons in 1974. The company became a public limited liability company on 19 November 1920. Denain-Anzin built a railway line to Azincourt to carry coke from the mines there to the factory. Between 1928 and 1946 Denain-Anzin invested 75 million in its two factories. Denain: Bureaux des Forges et ancienne Fosse Villars In the 1930s the company belonged to a cartel, the Comptoir Sid√©rurgique de France, which set quotas for each company's production of semi finished steel, structural shapes, merchant bars, thick plates and sheets. However, discipline was weak and the members often exceeded their quotas. Well before the 1948 merger with Nord-Est, the products manufactured by Denain-Anzin had slowly diverged from those by the Valenciennes division of Nord-Est, allowing each firm to scale up production in their speciality with reduced competition. For example, the two companies produced the same quantities of girders in 1930, but by 1936 Nord-Est produced six times as much as Denain-Anzin. After the June 1940 defeat of France during World War II (1939‚Äì45), a law of 16 August 1940 created Sidenor, the Groupement des Industries Side-rugiques du Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Denain-Anzin and Nord-Est both came under the control of Sidenor, producing 80% of its steel. Usinor (Union Sid√©rurgique du Nord) was created on 1 July 1948 by a merger of Denain-Anzin with Nord-Est (Forges et Aci√©ries du Nord et de l'Est). In 1957 the company became \\"Denain-Anzin\\", and it absorbed the Soci√©t√© anonyme des tubes de Valenciennes et de Denain, the Compagnie des terres r√©fractaires fran√ßaises, the Soci√©t√© des argiles de la Brie, the Soci√©t√© Les r√©fractaires de Longueville and the Soci√©t√© des produits min√©raux industriels. In 1965 it merged with the Soci√©t√© des forges et aci√©ries du Nord et de l'Est to form Denain-Anzin Nord-Est.

The site was proclaimed a National National Historic Site in 1922. History In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. The Emishi were able to successfully resist the Japanese for several decades; however, in 802 AD, the Chinjufu-sh≈çgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro led an expedition with 4000 troops from the ten provinces of eastern Japan (Suruga, Kai, Sagami, Musashi, Kazusa, Shim≈çsa, Hitachi, Shinano, K≈çzuke and Shimotsuke) and built Isawa Castle as his stronghold within Emishi territory in the valley of the Kitakami River. With the defeat of the Emishi chieftain Aterui, many of the Emishi tribes in the Shiwa District submitted to Japanese rule. In 803 AD, Shiwa Castle was established in what is now part of the city of Morioka to serve as an administrative center of the imperial government. However, the site was prone to flooding, and in 811 AD, and Shiwa Castle was abandoned in favor of Tokutan Castle approximately ten kilometers to the south. The garrison at Isawa Castle was reduced to 700 men in 815 AD, of whom many were local Emishi (known as ) in the service of the Yamato court. By the middle of the 9th century, mention of Isawa Castle largely disappears from the historical record, although it reappears as a stronghold of Abe no Munet≈ç in the Zenkunen War against the forces central government led by Minamoto no Yoriyoshi. It may have been destroyed by the Gosannen War of 1083. Overview Excavation research revealed that Isawa Castle was a square castle surrounded by double moat and wooden palisade measuring 670 meters on each side and thus enclosing an area of 460,000 square meters. At the center was a government office complex in a separate enclosure, with dimensions of 90 meters on each side.

When it entered the fighting it was assigned to the Western Front before Moscow, and it would remain in that Front for most of the war; when Western Front was dissolved the division went to one of its successor Fronts and served there until the last few weeks. It took part in the first Soviet winter counteroffensive, then played peripheral roles in the battles around the Rhzev salient, before advancing in the offensive that liberated Smolensk in the summer of 1943. After a series of frustrating attempts during the autumn and winter of 1943-44, the city of Orsha was finally liberated in the opening days of Operation Bagration, and the 352nd was recognized for its role in the battle. Soon after it was further decorated for its part in the liberation of Grodno. In the winter of 1945 the 352nd took part in the invasion of East Prussia and the capture of K√∂nigsberg, but in April it finally was swung off its very straightforward combat path when it and its 31st Army were transferred to 1st Ukrainian Front advancing into Czechoslovakia. Soon after the German surrender the division was slated as one of those to be disbanded in place in central Europe. Formation The division began forming on August 1, 1941, in the Volga Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 at Bugulma. Its first commander, Col. Yurii Mikhailovich Prokofev, was assigned the same day. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1158th Rifle Regiment * 1160th Rifle Regiment * 1162nd Rifle Regiment * 914th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 89 At the time it was forming the division's personnel was noted as containing a \\"high percentage of Tatars\\", which is unsurprising, given the location.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 The 352nd remained in Volga District until November 28, when it was ordered by STAVKA to join the 20th Army in the Moscow region. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 89 It departed Bugulma the next day and covered 1,250 km by rail over three days, arriving in Khimki early on December 2, an average of 400 km per day despite conditions of enemy air attack during the latter stages.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 =Battle of Moscow= As the division concentrated in the Khimki area on December 2, Western Front ordered 20th Army to go over to the offensive to seize the area of Krasnaya Polyana, Vladychino and Kholmy. Over the course of the next day the 331st Rifle Division and two rifle brigades advanced up to 2 km towards Krasnaya Polyana. The fighting for this village went on through December 6 against a stubborn defense by a battalion of the 106th Infantry Division, with tanks. The next day the 352nd was ordered to withdraw from this fight and concentrate in the area of Marfino in order to continue the offensive to the west. On December 11 the commander of 20th Army, Maj. Gen. A. A. Vlasov, ordered his forces to take Solnechnogorsk, where the division was to concentrate along with the 7th Guards Mortar Battalion. In the event encircling moves by other elements of the Army forced the enemy to abandon this town, and by evening the division had reached Peshki, helping to capture four tanks, 13 motor vehicles, seven mortars and 13 artillery pieces. Over the following week the 352nd continued to act as the Army reserve and on December 17 was concentrated in the area of Shapkino and Stegachevo.The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 3; part IV, ch. 2 By January 1, 1942, 20th Army had reached a line roughly along the Lama River and was fighting to improve its positions to continue the offensive to the west. During the night of January 1-2, the 1162nd Rifle Regiment, the 1st Battalion of the 1160th Regiment, and the 64th Rifle Brigade, backed by tanks, waged a fierce fight for the village of Birkino, which failed despite killing up to 40 enemy officers and soldiers; Birkino was finally liberated on January 4. On January 9 the division was ordered to destroy the enemy in the Timonino area with the support of the 537th Artillery Regiment and the 2nd Guards Mortar Battalion. The offensive of 2oth Army began with an artillery preparation at 0900 hrs. on January 10, and an infantry assault, backed by artillery and tanks, at 1030. The forward edge of the German defense was broken quite quickly but at no small cost to the attackers. With the help of the 49th Rifle Brigade (which was backed by a single KV tank and four T-34s) the 352nd captured Timonino by 1330, and then continued its offensive towards Kaleevo, Bolshoe Goloperovo and Afanasovo. In this fighting an enemy battalion was destroyed, with up to 250 corpses left on the battlefield, while the division's units captured three antiaircraft guns and four mortars, and destroyed an ammunition dump. Due to enemy resistance and heavy snow the Army was limited to an advance of 2 - 3 km on this day. Command control was \\"carried out comparatively well\\" with communications \\"maintained by radio and telephone... periodically with the 352nd Rifle Division.\\" By January 13 the offensive had progressed to the point that General Vlasov ordered his mobile group, 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps, into the breach, with the 352nd moving from Bolvasova to Vysokovo behind the cavalry's forward detachments. On the following day the 2nd Guards was held up by a German force of up to two battalions along a line from Vysokovo to Chukholovo, but this position was broken in part by the division and its attached artillery; but the end of the day the cavalry was fighting westwards and the Germans were falling back on Gzhatsk.The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 3; ch. 6 On January 17, 20th Army was pursuing the German forces on all their avenues of retreat. The main forces on the Army's right flank, including the 352nd, had reached as far south as the Ruza River. This advance continued over the next week, but the redeployment of 1st Shock and 16th Armies from the right flank of Western Front left 20th Army on a 40 km front facing Gzhatsk alone, and for these reasons the operation came to a standstill on January 25.The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 6 In Western Front In the last days of February 1942, the division was transferred to 5th Army, still in Western Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 45 where it would remain until August 1943. Colonel Prokovev relinquished command of the division on June 5, and was replaced by Lt. Col. Andrei Prokofevich Maltzev, who was promoted to the rank of Colonel on June 27. Maj. Gen. M. A. ProninIn the planning for Operation Mars, 5th Army was intended to participate in a widening offensive, after German 9th Army was encircled and defeated, through Vyasma to link up with forces of Kalinin Front near Smolensk to destroy Army Group Center. In the event, 9th Army was able to hold out, and this operation did not come to pass. On February 6, 1943, Maj. Gen. Mikhail Pronin took command of the division, which he would hold until June 2. In the aftermath of Operation Mars, on February 22, the 352nd, with the 29th Guards Rifle Division, assaulted the positions of German 4th Army's 35th Infantry Division east of Gzhatsk, tearing a small breach in the division's defenses. 5th Army then committed the 153rd Tank Brigade, plus a ski battalion, and later a full ski brigade, into the gap. After days of heavy fighting the exploiting forces were encircled and mostly destroyed by German counterattacks. The Front shut down until the German forces began evacuating the Rzhev salient in March.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 41, 328, 473 General Pronin, who would go on to be named a Hero of the Soviet Union in 1945 while leading the 16th Guards Rifle Division, was succeeded in command by Col. M. T. Ilin through the summer months. Shortly after the start of the summer offensive towards Smolensk in August, the division was transferred to 49th Army, where it would remain until the spring of the following year. It was also assigned to 62nd Rifle Corps at this time,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 217 but by the beginning of October it was back to being an independent division within its Army. As Western Front tried to continue its offensive into eastern Belorussia in early October, forward elements of 49th Army reached the Pronya River late on October 2. The 352nd was south of the town of Drybin. The strong German defenses in this region, manned by their 342nd and 35th Infantry Divisions, along with the weakness of his Army after months of offensive combat, convinced Col. Gen. I. T. Grishin that any further offensive action would be futile.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 27, 69 Beginning on October 12, Western Front began a new offensive towards Orsha. This was preceded by a complex regrouping of forces, in which 33rd Army was moved into the sector north and south of Lenino. In response, 49th Army's forces shifted north into the positions vacated by 33rd Army. From October 12-14, 352nd and 344th Rifle Divisions moved from the Drybin area into the sectors vacated by 33rd Army.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 71-72 After about five weeks in command, on October 25 Col. K. S. Kovalev was succeeded by Maj. Gen. Nikolai Mikhailovich Strizhenko, who would remain in command until October 13, 1944, apart from a break from August 5 to September 25, 1943. In March 1944, Western Front began yet another offensive against Orsha. At this time the division was back in 62nd Corps, and was in the first echelon of the attack as part of the Army's shock group. The Corps was to attack in the sector extending from Lazyrshchina southward to Lobany against the center section of 78th Sturm Division's sector; 63rd and 352nd Rifle Divisions would back up 247th Rifle Division in the lead. During the course of this offensive, the division was briefly redeployed into the sector of 31st Army, but by April 1 was, with its Corps, in 33rd Army. This renewed attack made virtually no progress and was shut down in April.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 383-96 =Operation Bagration= Later that month, Western Front was broken up into the 2nd and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. During this transition, the 352nd was assigned to the 113th Rifle Corps of 31st Army of 3rd Belorussian Front; it would remain in that Army, apart from one brief period in 1945, for the duration of the war.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 130 When the offensive began, 31st Army was facing the 260th Infantry and 25th Panzergrenadier divisions of the German XXVII Army Corps across the Dniepr River. In part due to the water obstacle the Army's offensive developed slowly over the first few days, but once the Dniepr was crossed the town of Dubrovno was reached on June 25, just 15km east of Orsha.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 141-51 On June 27, the division was given credit for its role in the liberation of the city of Orsha and received its name as an honorific: On July 25 the division was further distinguished with a unit award of the Order of the Red Banner for its service in the liberation of Grodno. Into Germany and Czechoslovakia On October 14, General Strizhenko was replaced in command by Col. Viktor Ivanovich Rutko. One month later the 352nd was recognized for its participation in the battles along the borders of East Prussia with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class. At the start of the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January 1945, the division was in the 36th Rifle Corps of 31st Army, but before the end of the month the Corps was taken under direct Front command.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, pp. 11, 45 During the advance on K√∂nigsberg the 352nd, with its Corps, was assigned to the 5th Army,Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 233, 243 before returning to 31st Army by the end of March.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, pp. 79, 144 On March 22, Maj. Gen. Rakhim Sagib Gareevich Maksutov took command of the division, which he would hold for the duration. In April, the entire 31st Army was shifted out of 3rd Belorussian Front and moved south. In the last three weeks of the war the 352nd Division and its Army were under the command of 1st Ukrainian Front, advancing into Czechoslovakia.

Battis (1863 ‚Äì 1937) was an American politician who served on the Boston Common Council, Boston Board of Aldermen, and the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Early life Battis was born on January 19, 1863 in East Boston. He attended Boston public schools. Outside of politics, Battis worked as a wholesale shoe salesman. At one time he served a president of Winch Brothers. Political career In 1892, Battis was elected chairman of the Ward 1 Republican committee. From 1899 to 1901, Battis was a member of the Boston Common Council. From 1902 to 1904 he represented the 1st Suffolk District (consisting of Ward 1) in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1904 he served as chairman of the House Committee on Printing. From 1906 to 1907 he was a member of the Boston Board of Alderman. Larceny conviction In 1909, Battis was indicted for larceny. He was alleged to have charged the city of Boston $334.25 more than he actually paid for trophies he purchased for the East Boston Fourth of July celebrations in 1906 and 1907. His first trial ended on March 23, 1909. After nine and a half hours of deliberation, the jury was unable to reach a decision. His second trial began on May 25, 1909. On May 28, the jury returned a guilty verdict. He received a three-year sentence and was sent to Deer Island Prison. On December 22, 1910, Battis received a pardon from Governor Eben Sumner Draper and the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Battis' poor health, his good behavior in prison, and the fact that others who had been implicated in similar cases had received lighter sentences, were reported to be factors in the decision to pardon him. Death Upon his release from prison, Battis returned to East Boston. He died in September 1937.

The name is derived from the Tamil language, whereby \\"Parthu\\" means 'to see' and \\"Irippu\\" means 'seated', the combination of which is 'to sit and see all around'. The front section of the temple, together with the Pattirippuwa was built in 1802, during the reign of King Sri Vickrama Rajasingha, by the royal architect, Devendra Moolacharya. Moolacharya is also credited with the designing and construction of the Magul Maduwa (the Audience Hall), the Kandy Lake (Kiri Muhuda), Walakula Bamma (Cloud Wall) and Diyarella Bemma. The Pattirippuwa was constructed on the site of the old temple kitchen. The Pattirippuwa was intended as a place where Rajasingha could exhibit the sacred tooth relic to the surrounding populace, view the temple festivals, peraheras and on important occasions address his subjects. The symbolism of its octagonal form, reinforced the view that when the king stood in the tower, with the eight points in the compass radiating out around him he stood at the centre of the world. During the British period, it had been used to house an oriental library where the upstairs was used to accommodate the library and downstairs to provide space for the librarian monk. It currently houses the temple's library of ancient palm leaf buddhist manuscripts and books. On 11 February 1948, following the country's political independence from British rule, the national flag (Lion Flag) was raised for the first time over the Paththirippuwa. On 25 January 1998 the temple, including the Pattirippuwa, was severely damaged following the detonation of a truck bomb by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The restoration work on the Pattirippuwa was undertaken by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, under the guidance of the Department of Archaeology. The restoration process took over a year and was completed by August 1999.

He was unknown to the public, and it was not until 1990s when the ISPR highlighted his role as a war hero when releasing the telefilm bearing the same name of operation that was aired on the STN; his role was played by Talat Hussain in the 1990s. His death also went unnoticed in 1977, and it was only in 2016, when the Pakistan Navy officially recognised his services on their official page on Facebook.

Long engaged in educational work in Chicago, she founded the Kenwood Institute (1884), and Mrs. Starrett's Classical School for Girls (1893), of which she was principal. Starrett also founded Western Magazine (1880‚Äì83, Chicago); served as president of the Illinois Woman's Press Association, 1893‚Äì1894; and was the author of several works. Early years and education Helen Martha Ekin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, September 19, 1840. She was the daughter of Rev. John and Esther Fell (Lee) Ekin. She was educated at Pittsburg High School. Career =Educator= Starrett was the founder of Kenwood Institute, Chicago, before serving as Principal of Mrs. Starrett's Classical School for Girls, a co-operative with the University of Chicago. This school occupied a colonial home, surrounded by of lawn. Ten resident pupils were received in the family of the Principal. Day pupils were limited in number to 100. Its certificate admits to Vassar College, Wellesley College, Smith College, as well as to the University of Chicago. =Activist, suffragette= In 1915, she was appointed one of the 100 electors who each five years decided on additions to the list of eminent Americans who would be included in the Hall of Fame established in 1900 by New York University. Starrett and Ida M. Tarbell were the only women who were added to the list of electors at that time. A delegate to the first U.S. woman suffrage convention (1870) and the last (1920), Starrett was the only surviving member of the pioneer suffragettes who first focused public opinion by means of a general convention on the campaign for women's votes. =Writer= The Future of Educated Women (1885) Letters to Elder Daughters, Married and Unmarried (1888) After College, What?: For Girls (1896) Starrett was a contributor to magazines, such as The Continent a Presbyterian publication from McCormick Publishing Company, as well as educational and religious journals. She was the author of Future of Educated Women, 1880: Letters to a Daughter, 1882; Letters to Elder Daughters, 1883; Gyppie, an Obituary, 1884; Pete, the Story of a Chicken, 1885; Letters to a Little Girl, 1886; andCrocus and Wintergreen, poems (with her sister, Frances Ekin Allison). Published by Jansen, McClurg & Co., Chicago, The Future Of Educated Women, by Helen Ekin Starrett; and Men, Women And Money, by Frances Ekin Allison, were bound together in one book. The former and larger essay was the more mature of the two, and, although not altogether free from haste and opinionatedness, it had the merit of a point of view. The author discussee the matter of self-support and independence, and that however urgent such may be, they are reduced to insignificance by the necessity of women finding a means of expression for the spiritual growth that takes place in them. She also spoke about labor, like virtue, may be its own reward; and from professional and other means of expressing the fullness of human nature, certainly no one should be debarred. The second essay, by Frances Ekin Allison, is thought out on a lower key, and referenced the independence that a woman feels when she has a source of income in her own right. Personal life On February 15, 1864, she married Rev. William A. Starrett. She died December 16, 1920, in Portland, Oregon. Selected works * After college, what?

It refers to portions of the matchmaking ranking spectrum where individual matches are of poor quality, and are often determined by factors such as poor team coordination which are perceived to be outside the individual player's control. This ostensibly makes it difficult for skilled players to \\"climb\\" up the matchmaking ranking (and out of Elo hell), due to the difficulty of consistently winning games under these conditions. Its existence in various games has been debated, and some game developers have called it an illusion caused by cognitive bias.  History  The term was coined based on the Elo rating system designed by Arpad Elo, which was initially used for chess games but began to be used in video games as well. It was initially used by the League of Legends community, but spread in usage to other games that used the same ranking system. In these games, players are ranked based on their individual and team performance. However, the shortcomings in this system are that comparatively unskilled players, with inflated ratings, can be matched via automated matchmaking to legitimately high skilled players and drag them down when they contribute to the loss of a match. At low Elo, a skilled player will likely find it easy to rise in rank, while at high Elo, the quality of players improves. However, there is a certain range where skilled players can remain stuck regardless of their personal skill, which is referred to as Elo hell. In League of Legends, it is said to occur between the 1300 and 1500 range. Elo rankings have also been \\"abused\\" by players who create parties of their friends in order to \\"escape\\" Elo hell. This has been addressed by forcing players who are in groups to play against groups of similar size. Another way players have attempted to bypass Elo hell is by smurfing, or creating new accounts without a skill rating, which allows them to ascend in rank faster than they would with their original account. Elo hell has also been noted as existing outside of video games, such as in the matchmaking app Tinder, which also uses a variant of the Elo rating system.  Effects  Supposing that one is in Elo hell has been known to cause frustration and video game rage. This can lead to \\"toxic\\" behavior amongst players who are angry at their teammates for sabotaging their Elo rating, whether the grievance is legitimate or not. This has caused games that use the Elo system to be noted as some of the most \\"toxic\\" games to play.  Reception  Esports players of competitive games have recommended that players who are \\"stuck in Elo hell\\" \\"take every game seriously\\" and focus on winning at all costs. They have also suggested that players should always blame themselves for any losses rather than blaming it on their team. Esports critic and Youtuber Duncan \\"Thorin\\" Shields claimed that Elo hell was actually caused by the player themselves, due to their positive illusions about their own skill. Riot Games claimed in a 2013 update to the matchmaking FAQ of League of Legends that Elo hell did not exist, citing the Dunning-Kruger effect and negativity bias from their worst experiences with the game as reasons why players believe the system is \\"imbalanced\\". They also claimed that players needed 150-300 games to reach their \\"true\\" matchmaking score. Dom Sacco of Esports News UK claimed that Elo hell does exist in League of Legends, and that escaping it is possible, but is a \\"mammoth time sink\\". Experiments conducted by two Dota 2 players appeared to conclude that Elo hell did not exist in that game in a significant way, as an experienced player was able to raise their rank merely by playing well and \\"carrying\\" their team. The third competitive season of Overwatch introduced changes in skill rating ostensibly designed to prevent players from being stuck in Elo hell. However, in season five of Overwatch, in-game \\"toxic\\" behavior and community backlash only increased due to tweaks in the game's Elo algorithms, causing the game's competitive mode to become \\"depressing\\".

When Agustina's father Enrique arrives to woo Elena to return to him, he sees that the only way that Manolo's parents will approve of his marriage to Agustina is if he can remove Agustina from Elena's influence. He invites Elena to return with him to his ranch, but Elena wishes to remain in Madrid and pursue her opera career. The two live apart so that Enrique can see to his ranch while she pursues her career. Agustina guilts her mother into going to the ranch, and the two, along with a coterie of Elena's friends, as well as Manolo, travel to visit Enrique. The large group quickly makes themselves at home.

Many research mathematicians see no ethical implications in their pure research but assumptions made in mathematical approaches can have real consequences Chiodo, M. & Bursill-Hall, P. (2018) Four Levels of Ethical Engagement Discussion paper 18/1, Cambridge University Ethics in Mathematics Project. A very instrumental interpretation of the impact of mathematics makes it difficult to see ethical consequences, but it is easier to see how all branches of mathematics serve to structure and conceptualise solutions to real problems Slightly dirty maths: The richly textured mechanisms of impact Laura R. Meagher Ursula Martin, Research Evaluation (2017) 26 (1): 15-27. These structures can set up perverse incentives, where targets can be met without improving services, or league table positions are gamed. While the assumptions written into metrics often reflect the world view of the groups who are responsible for designing them, they are harder for non-experts to challenge, leading to injustices O'Neill, C. (2016) Weapons of Math Destruction, Penguin.. Need for ethics in the mathematics profession Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the Manhattan Project, while the overextended use of the Gaussian copula formula to price derivatives before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has been called \\"the formula that killed Wall Street\\",Felix Salmon, Recipe for disaster: the formula that killed Wall Street\\", Wired23 Feb 2009. and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of mathematical models of climate. For the same reason as in medical ethics and engineering ethics, the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions. The potential impact of data and new technology is leading more professions, such as accountancy Ethics and New Techologies, ICAEW, 2018, to consider how bias is overseen in automated systems, from algorithms to AI. Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care. * The Club of Rome's 1972 mathematical-model based predictions in The Limits to Growth of widespread collapse of the world system by the end of the century. * Wrongful conviction of Sally Clark (1999), An English solicitor, Sally Clark, was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two children ‚Äì each of whom had died due to sudden infant death syndrome ‚Äì due to a fundamental statistical error in the testimony of an \\"expert\\". The error was further compounded by the \\"prosecutor's fallacy\\".Derbyshire, D., \\"Misleading statistics were presented as facts in Sally Clark trial\\", The Telegraph, (12 June 2003). Ethical issues in the mathematical profession Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with information economy professionals in general, such as duty of care, confidentiality of information, whistleblowing, and avoiding conflict of interest. Mathematicians have a professional responsibility to support the ethical use of mathematics in practice, both sustain the reputation of the profession and protect society from the impacts of ethical behaviour. For example, mathematics is extensively applied in the use of Big Data in Artificial Intelligence applications, both by mathematicians and non- mathematicians, with complex impacts that are not readily understood or anticipated Collmann & Matei (Eds.), Ethical Reasoning in Big Data, Basel, CH: Springer, 2016. Ethics in data journalism Journalism has an established Professional ethics which is affected by mathematical processing and (re-)publication of sources. Reusing information packaged as facts requires checking, and validating, form conceptual confusion to sampling and calculation errors.McBride, , 2017 Other professional issues arise from the potential of automated tools which allow dissemination of publicly available data which has never been collated. Misuse of statistics Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly. In the 1980s statisticians codified their ethics in a declaration of the ISI, recognising that there would often be conflicting demands from stakeholders, with ethical decisions a matter of professional judgement Jowell, R. (1986) The Codification of Statistical Ethics, J. Official Statist. 2(3): 217-253. Mathematical folklore Priority and attribution of mathematical discovery are important to professional practice, even as some theorems bear the name of the person making the conjecture rather than finding the proof. Folk theorems, or mathematical folklore cannot be attributed to an individual, and may not have an agreed proof, despite being an accepted result, potentially leading to injusticevan Bendegem, J., Rittberg, C. & Tanswell, F. (2018) Epistemic Injustice in Mathematics, Synthese. Ethics in pure mathematical research The American Mathematical Society publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors.American Mathematical Society Policy Statement on Ethical Guidelines, 2005. The European Mathematical Society Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.Code of Practice ‚Äì European Mathematical Society. It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues. Reuben Hersh, Mathematics and ethics, The Mathematical Intelligencer 12 (3) (1990), 13‚Äì15. However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.James Franklin, Ethics of mathematics, Mathematical Intelligencer 13 (1) (1991), 4.

Based on a 2014 free version, it was released for Steam on December 8, 2016 and on itch.io on March 12, 2020. The game is centered around metafictional concepts, which have been described by the developers as \\"the world knows you exist\\". This affects its story, which depicts the player as a separate character from Niko, the protagonist. Both characters arrive in an unfamiliar world, and aim to replace its sun at the top of a tower. OneShot received largely positive reviews, most of which focused on its narrative aspects. Gameplay OneShot features a variety of puzzles that are solved from a top-down perspective. In OneShot, the player controls the child Niko, who is placed into an unfamiliar sunless world. Although the game exclusively shows Niko's viewpoint, employing a top-down perspective, the player is a separate character. Throughout the game, Niko can rest, causing the program to close; upon reopening, a short dream sequence is played. As is typical for adventure games, gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles (including fetch quests) involving items. Items can either be used to interact with a specific location, or combined to form a new item. Throughout the game, the player encounters in-game computers, which signal that the player has to find content outside the game, including in the filesystem. This can also involve interacting with the computer in other ways ‚Äì for instance, moving the game window off-screen and back to mimic developing film. Due to these concepts the in-game instructions recommend playing in windowed mode. Plot The game's protagonist is a juvenile cat-like person, Niko, who awakes in a dark and unfamiliar house. They interact with a computer, which addresses the player by a name derived from the computer's login name via an external dialog box. According to the machine, the world that Niko currently is in is close to ruin, and the goal of the player is to guide Niko back to their homeworld. They discover the world's sun, which takes the form of a lightbulb, and use it to exit the house, emerging in a barren wasteland. There, they encounter a robot, who informs them that they are prophesised to save the world. Niko's goal is to carry the sun through the world's three areas, and place it at the top of a central tower, restoring light to the world; the current area, termed the \\"Barrens\\", is a desolate wasteland. This robot teaches Niko to communicate with the player's presence, discovering that the player apparently is a god of the in-game world and that Niko is their \\"Messiah\\". Their responsibility in- game as a god is purportedly to assist and guide Niko. Niko meets Silver, a more sentient \\"tamed\\" robot, who gifts them a piece of amber, which Niko uses to journey into the next area of the world. This area, termed the \\"Glen\\", has arboreal characteristics. To aid their journey, Niko interacts with the area's residents, including the younger child Alula and older child Calamus, as well as the nature spirit Maize. Niko finally enters the urbanised third area, the \\"Refuge\\", and is directed to city library; they travel down to the city's surface to get there, meeting various characters, such as a lamplighter, along the way. Once at the library, they are directed to the head librarian, George, and get her attention with the help of researcher Kip Silverpoint. After some study, George translates a book of Niko's. It states that the tower, which is controlled by an \\"entity\\", can be accessed using three phosphoric items. This \\"entity\\" is apparently the same voice that interacted with the player at the beginning of the game, and has some level of control over the world. Niko happens to have two suitable items on hand, and George gifts them the final one. Niko arrives at the tower, with the player unable to speak to Niko anymore. The entity informs them that both they and the player have reached their goal, and that they will return home now. Niko sees this as anti- climatic, but complies. The player finds a mysterious note has appeared as their new desktop wallpaper, telling them how to reconnect with Niko, and the player reappears, guiding them to the top. Discovering notes made by a mysterious figure termed \\"the Author\\", they learn that the entity has grown out of control and became destructive. Once at the top, the Author informs them that they can either break the sun and return Niko home, which would destroy the world, or place the sun at the top of the tower, trapping Niko in this world. Niko leaves the decision up to the player, forming the ending of the game. =\\"Solstice\\" path= After the completion of the game, a note appears in the user's Documents folder, allowing the player to continue via the alternate \\"Solstice\\" ending path. This begins similarly to the main path, with the exception of Niko possessing a book by the Author. When Niko meets Silver, they travel to an observation room instead, and meet a more advanced prototype of the robot in the Barrens. The prototype reminds Niko of the events of the original story line, which took place before this repeat. According to them, the world is a simulation, termed the \\"World Machine\\"; this new run is a reset of the machine. Niko, Silver, and the prototype travel to the Glen, but the latter two are crushed by a rockfall. There, Niko meets Calamus and Alula again, before encountering the mechanic Cedric and repairing his plane. Cedric tells Niko that his father was the Author, and that he created the World Machine after the previous world's destruction, to prevent it from repeating. Niko and Cedric take the plane to the Refuge, and Cedric uses a backup to restore the prototype, instructing Niko to find Rue, a sentient fox. Rue reveals that the World Machine and the Entity are the same; Niko's presence in the world corrupted its intent. Cedric and the restored prototype reappear, and alongside Niko, they enter the internals of the world machine, \\"taming\\" it and reversing its destructive behaviour. Afterwards, the world is restored, reverting the deaths of characters, and Niko returns home. Development The game started as freeware; this version was made in a month, and released online on June 30, 2014 by creators Eliza Velasquez and Casey Gu. It was developed as an entry for RPGMakerWeb's 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest, but did not receive any accolades. According to Gu, OneShot was designed with an all-encompassing \\"dark but vibrant\\" theme to reflect the lack of sunlight in the setting. The areas of its world were inspired by the RGB colour model, and music for each area was only composed after its respective visual design was completed. Both Gu and Velasquez cite several thematic inspirations for the original game, including Hyper Light Drifter, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, Yume Nikki, and The Little Prince. In a later interview with PC Gamer, Velasquez also attributed the fourth-wall-breaking aspect of the game to the character Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid. After being featured at GDC, the previous version's \\"rerelease\\" was made available on Steam two years later, on December 8, 2016. On March 28, 2017, the Steam version was updated, with a new \\"Solstice\\" ending path that solved some mysteries that players had about the game's content. A Mac release of this version was made available on May 31, 2018, with gameplay intended to be \\"as close to the Windows version as possible\\". This was followed by a Linux version, which was released on April 24, 2019. Reception OneShot received largely positive reviews according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer John Walker referred to it as \\"completely charming, delightfully written, and extremely clever\\" Charlie Nicholson of New Game Network compared it to Undertale and Pony Island, but conceded that it wasn't \\"revolutionary\\"'. Multiple reviewers commended the metafictional aspects of the game. Walker claimed that \\"It does stuff with my PC that I didn't know games could do\\". Charlie Nicholson praised its \\"transcen[sion of]... boundaries to directly involve the player\\", stating that he was tempted \\"to resort to blue-tacking [his] webcam\\". Hardcore Gamer reviewer Spencer Rutledge praised the game's story, stating that \\"OneShot effortlessly conveys emotion\\". Walker stated that its cast \\"nearly always contain[s] a moment that will make you smile\\". Opposingly, Nicholson claimed it did not have depth compared to other metafictional games, deeming its cast \\"lacking\\" and too distant from Niko. Both Nicholson and Rutledge positively reviewed the game's art direction, with the former stating that it aurally \\"almost seems like a dream at times\\". In 2017, OneShot was nominated for the \\"PC Game of the Year\\" category of the Golden Joystick Awards.

It was published posthumously in Brazil in the late 1970s. The book takes the form of dialogue between a male \\"Author\\" and his female creation, Angela Pralini (a character who shares a name with a character who appears in Lispector's Where Were You at Night). The god-like author infuses the so- called breath of life into his creation who speaks, breathes, lives and dies at his behest. The author loves yet wants to destroy Angela even though he can not ultimately separate her from himself. The novel has been characterized as a lyrically schizoid duet between two distinct but overlapping voices which delve into the inner nature of thoughts, sensations, words, facts, and objects and the relations between each. The text is also said to confuse the two voices, and open up a wild space of contradiction and paradox. When Lispector died she left behind a mountain of fragments that compose what became A Breath of Life. The fragments were structured and organized by Olga Borelli, Lispector's assistant and friend. The final form of the book reflects the dark interior dialogue that took place in Lispector's head near the end of her life. In 2012, A Breath of Life was published for the first time in English by New Directions in a translation by Johnny Lorenz edited by Benjamin Moser.

A Republican, he served two non-consecutive terms in the Oregon House of Representatives. In between those terms, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate for one term. In both the house and senate, the districts he represented were large and rural. Merryman was also a pioneer doctor who made house calls by horse and buggy for many years. He later built the first modern hospital in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Early life  Merryman was born in Astoria, Oregon on 28 June 1878, the son of Captain John D. and Rebecca Ann (Eagleton) Merryman.\\"Dr. George H.

Merryman\\", Oregon Voter (Volume 16, Number 1), Portland, Oregon, 4 January 1919, p. 57. His father was the collector of customs in Astoria for several years; then became the cashier for the United States Customs House in Portland, Oregon.\\"Captain Merryman Dead; Former Customs Official\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, 27 October 1920, p. 16. When his father took that job, his family moved to Hillsboro, Oregon. He attended public school there before enrolling in the Tualatin Academy in Forest Grove, Oregon. He entered Oregon Agricultural College in 1895. He went on to attend the University of Oregon and the University of Illinois College of Physicians and Surgeons in Chicago, where he received his medical degree in 1902.\\"Additional Locals\\", Hillsboro Argus, Hillboro, Oregon, 19 September 1895, p. 3.\\"Tom Practice Medicine\\", Morning Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 9 July 1902, p. 7.

In that capacity, he made several trips to the Far East, visiting ports in Japan and China, including Hong Kong. Each round trip voyage took approximately three months.local news item, Hillsboro Argus, Hillboro, Oregon, 17 July 1902, p. 3. In 1903, Merry moved to Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. He was one of the area's first doctors. In 1904, Merryman became the coroner for Klamath County, serving in this position through 1906. The Klamath Basin was a relatively undeveloped area, so Merryman made most of his house calls by horse and buggy. Even after he acquired his first automobile in 1911, he continued to make some house calls on horseback to avoid getting his vehicle stuck on rugged country roads.\\"Dr. George Merryman of Klamath Falls Dies\\", News-Review, Roseburg, Oregon, 7 May 1948, p. 2. During this period, Merryman also became actively involved in professional and community affairs.

It was built under the name of Saint Francois by the Smiths Dock Company at the South Bank in Middlesbrough on the River Tees in Northeast England for the Compagnie Navale de l'Oc√©anie for the Pacific Island postal and general trade service, for which it sailed the waters of the Pacific from 1914 to 1921. The ship suffered minor damage during the First World War during the Bombardment of Papeete, prior to coming into the hands of the Langley Bros who placed it in the Sydney to Coffs Harbour route from 1922 to 1925. Upon the demise of the Langley Bros shipping firm in 1925 the vessel came into the service of John Burke and Co and was used for the Northern Queensland runs prior to its loss on 4 April 1926. Ship description and construction =The ship builder= The SS Dorrigo was originally built under the name of Saint Francois by the Smiths Dock Company established by Thomas Smith who bought William Rowe's shipyard at St. Peter's in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1810 and traded as William Smith & Co. The company became associated with South Bank in Middlesbrough on the River Tees in Northeast England, after opening an operation there in 1907. Smiths Dock increasingly concentrated its shipbuilding business at South Bank, with its North Shields Yard being used mainly for repair work. =Ship description= Dorrigo underway in Port Jackson The vessel was described as being a fine type of modern passenger and cargo steamer. It was specifically built for the mail service between the French Islands and had comfortable first class accommodation for 25 passengers situated in the deck, amidships, with electric bells, lights and fans to each berth. Adjoining the dining saloon which was also on the deck was a stately smoke lounge room. The vessel also had accommodation for 20 second-class passengers, situated under the promenade deck and described as in keeping with the first-class accommodation in the matter of comfort. The vessel was fitted with a powerful searchlight and wireless, and all the latest appliances. The vessel was a steel single deck and the bridge ship with two masts. Its dimensions were: :Length from foredeck of stem to stern post: Lloyd's Register of Australian and New Zealand Shipping 1922‚Äì1923 :Main breadth to outside plank: :Depth from uppermost continuous deck to bottom of the hold: The vessel measured : and a : Propulsion Dorrigo was powered by a single steel boiler producing of steam pressure. This steam fed a triple-expansion steam engine. It had cylinders of , and bore by stroke, developed 96 NHP. The engines were capable of maintaining a speed of . Ship service history =The steamer Saint Francois, Pacific Service with Compagnie Navale de l'Oc√©anie 1913‚Äì1922= SS Dorrigo as the SS Saint Francois undergoing sea trials in 1913 In November 1914 Saint Francois arrived in Auckland from Tahiti to undergo a general overhaul. The small passenger and cargo steamer first arrived at Sydney on Thursday 8 April 1915 from Tahiti, via Noum√©a, with 350 tons of copra. The steamer was normally engaged in the inter-island trade between Tahiti and other South Sea islands. The Saint Francois next arrived in Sydney from Noum√©a to undergo repairs to her stern in late February 1916, which had been considerably damaged in Tahiti, with the estimate of the cost of the work is ¬£2000. In April 1916 the Saint Francois was involved in the rescue of the steamer Flora. The Flora had left Auckland on 11 April for the Eastern Pacific, and all went well until the ship was about out from Rarotonga, en route for Raiatea, when one of the two crank-shafts broke. When the mishap occurred the engineers of the Flora set to work to try to effect repairs. For four and a half days and nights the vessel drifted, while the engineers toiled in the sweltering heat of the engine room. On the fifth day temporary repairs were effected, and the vessel was once more brought under control. Two hours and a half later the rivets joining the broken shaft gave way, and the Flora again began to drift. Shortly afterwards it came into touch with the French steamer Saint Francois. Up to this time the weather had been fine, but when the Saint Francois hove into sight there were lowering clouds, and every indication of a storm. The Flora was taken in tow and Papeete was reached three days and three hours later, the distance of being covered at an average speed of per hour During 1920 the Saint Francois was involved in towing the hulks Pey Berland and Chateau Baret (formerly the British barque Cadwgan) back to New Caledonia. Both hulks had typically imported chromium ore into Australia and took coal back to New Caledonia. WWI Service In October 1914 the C&O; companies Saint Francois arrived in Auckland from Raratonga for repairs, coal and water. The crew gave statements that the capital of Tahiti Papeete had been bombarded by German warships. A ricocheting shell had struck the funnel of the Saint Francois with another hole also in the vessel's hull above the water line. Additionally part of the vessel had undergone repairs for a grounding several months earlier as well as a survey. =Langley W. & Sons Service 1922‚Äì1925= Dorrigo leaving Coffs Harbour The Vessel SS Fitzroy at Coffs Harbour which the Dorrigo replaced upon its loss In October 1921 Messrs. Langley Bros. purchased the Saint Francois and renamed the vessel Dorrigo to replace the ill-fated Fitzroy, which foundered off the coast the previous June, and the vessel was placed into the same Coffs Harbour to Sydney route. At this time the vessel was also modified with part of the after hold being converted into a butter chamber, to carry 5,000 boxes of butter to meet the increasing coastal trade. On Thursday 9 December the Dorrigo first arrived on its maiden run for Woolgoolga and Coffs Harbour for the passenger and cargo traffic trade between Sydney. An open invitation to visit and inspect her during the morning was extended to the public. The vessel was described as to all intents and purposes a new ship and representing the last word in comfort for the coastal service, and capable of covering the distance between Coffs Harbour and Sydney in about 17 hours. By April 1925 the shipping firm of Langley Bros, went into voluntary liquidation with the shipping fleet offered for sale by public tender following serious competition from the New South Wales Government railways in the Coff's Harbour trade. The Dorrigo had been laid up since December 1924 owing to the falling off in passenger receipts. =John Burke and Co Ltd Service 1925= SS Dorrigo In July 1925 it was announced that The passenger steamer Dorrigo, which since 1921 had been engaged in the passenger and cargo service between Sydney and Coff's Harbour, had been purchased by John Burke, Ltd., for use in trade between Brisbane and North Queensland ports. The vessel had only recently been purchased by the North Coast Steam Navigation Company, with other vessels of the Langley fleet. It was intended to run between Brisbane and Cooktown via ports, and expected to extend sailings to Thursday Island, when cargoes warranted. Upon arrival of the cargo steamer Dorrigo at Cairns in September 1925 the cargo was declared \\"black\\" by the waterside workers who were engaged in a dispute and who then decided not to remove the cargo from Brisbane, of which there were 100 tons for Cairns. The ship left again for Brisbane via Townsville and Bowen with the Cairns cargo still aboard.  Sinking of the SS Dorrigo  The Dorrigo left Brisbane at 7 pm on 1 April for Thursday Island and intermediate northern ports carried a crew of 24, most of whom were residents of Brisbane and with between 500‚Äì600 tons of general cargo, including some benzene and kerosene. When the Dorrigo was ready to leave Brisbane on Thursday afternoon it was reported to the master that one of the firemen was ill. He was given attention, but his condition was such that it was deemed advisable to take him ashore. In his stead J. Wrench, a well-known seafarer of Brisbane, joined the ship ten minutes before it sailed. The steamer Dorrigo foundered at 6 am on Friday 2 April 1926 off Double Island Point. The first report of the disaster was not 'flashed across' the seas until an early hour on Saturday night. Then the lighthouse at Double Island Point had flashed to him a hurried alarm and a call of the mariner's \\"S.O.S.\\" This was followed by a despatch intimating briefly the first news of the wreck. Within three hours of the flashes of the first word Brisbane was advised. It was reported by the Captain of the Dorrigo that the vessel had foundered with Double Island Point lighthouse, bearing north-west . The Steamer Moruya had picked up a raft with Captain C. W. Gray and his son W. E. Gray on board. The cargo from the Dorrigo had been washed ashore along a stretch of beach at Fraser's Island. Cabin doors, cased goods and kerosene were included in the wreckage, but the searchers had failed in their search for survivors. It was claimed at the time by J. E. Burke, the governing director of John Burke, Limited shipping company that the Dorrigo \\"was exceedingly sea worthy and we were perfectly satisfied, with her. I cannot understand how the vessel foundered, more particularly as last week she was in the cyclone that dealt severely with the Cooma, and she entered port only a few hours late. She was a speedy vessel, and invariably did the trip from Brisbane to Sydney in 41 or 42 hours. These facts, combined with the knowledge that she was on her second voyage since her last overhaul, leads me to believe that something very remarkable lies contributed to her destruction.\\" It was reported that the Captain and his son had survived the wreck and 30 hours lost at sea with tiger sharks in length nosing around the makeshift raft-of the aft deck sun awning-upon which they floated after the steamer had foundered. =Wreck location and wreckage= The wreck site is yet to be found.

Gjika amplifiers are original designs, and are completely hand-wired. Origins Robert Gjika was born in Winthrop, Massachusetts, in 1960. At a young age began building his own guitars and amplifiers. His father was an electrician, giving him an early start in electronics. By 1979, he had established himself in the local Boston area as a luthier, repairing and building guitars and amplifiers for E.U. Wurlitzer Music and Sound. After a year+ working there, he opened up his own shop in Boston, where he was soon in-demand for all things related to guitars and amplifiers. Some of the musicians and bands he did work for included popular Boston bands at the time, guitarists such as Reeves Gabrels, guitar wizard Joe Stump, and other guitarists from the Berklee College of Music scene. Relocations Gjika moved his business from Boston to Memphis, Tennessee in 1987, where he met the late Shawn Lane, and introduced Shawn to his guitars and single-ended amp designs. In 1989 he relocated to Los Angeles, California, to focus on producing the \\"Gold\\" amps, with a new business partner, Bill Walker, under the brand name \\"Gjika-Walker\\". In 1990, after the business partnership was dissolved, Gjika left Los Angeles to go to Austin, Texas, where the music scene was flourishing, and at that time, transitioned from his Gold Amps to his 3-Channel KT90 amplifier. In 1996 he again relocated, to Nashville, Tennessee. During these years he continued his amp designing and building, on a smaller scale, until in 2000 he went back to California, where he currently resides and builds his amplifiers in Escondido. Public reception In Memphis, Gjika's Quality Guitars, on Union Avenue, was featured in a local music publication, in which Tim O'Shea said of Gjika's skills: \\"His technical expertise is most impressive, especially his \\"diagnosis to repair\\" knowledge of another rock necessity, the electric PA and amp... Gjika also builds and sells his custom, \\"Hot Box\\" amplifiers, perhaps the finest available anywhere.\\" Of Bob's custom guitar designs: \\"Gjika builds three or four of his custom 'Wild Thing' guitars each year, at a cool five grand apiece. The prototype guitars are truly wonders to behold at any stage of construction.\\" Focusing on his own playing, as well as designing and building guitars and amps, Gjika acquired a reputation for being reclusive, resulting in many believing that he had retired from amp building.

It was both the first part to have been begun and the last one to be completed in his projected but unfinished cycle of works based on Hermann Broch‚Äôs novel, The Death of Virgil. A performance lasts about forty minutes. History In March 1956, Barraqu√© first formed a plan to set passages, in the French translation by Albert Kohn, from the second book (\\"Fire‚ÄîThe Descent\\") of Hermann Broch's novel The Death of Virgil, and straightaway began composing Le Temps restitu√©. He finished a first draft in Paris on 20 October 1957, and then added a new beginning and cover page dated 11 December of the same year. In this respect, it forms the basis for all the subsequent works in the cycle . He then devised a revised plan for the second book, which included details of the intended orchestration of Le Temps restitu√©, but set aside the draft in favour of other projects. It was only in the summer of 1967 that the offer of a performance at next year's Royan Festival rekindled Barraqu√©'s interest and he resumed work on the score, completing it in Florence on 8 February 1968. The first performance took place on 4 April 1968, as part of the Royan Festival. Helga Pilarczyk was the soprano soloist, with members of the French Radio Choir (prepared by Jean-Paul Kr√©der) and the Ensemble du Domaine Musical, conducted by Gilbert Amy. The same forces gave the first Paris performance at a Domaine Musical concert in the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôOd√©on on 25 April 1968. There was only one further performance during the composer's lifetime, on 9 April 1973, at the Maison de l‚ÄôO.R.T.F. in Paris with Anne Bartelloni (soprano), the French Radio chamber choir (using three voices on a part instead of twelve soloists), and the Ars Nova ensemble, conducted by Jean-Paul Kr√©der (; ). The third performance was the US premiere, and took place on 10 August 1978 at the Tanglewood Music Festival in Lenox, Massachusetts, with the Berkshire Music Center Orchestra conducted by Gunther Schuller (; ). On 1 October 1970, Barraqu√© began what was meant to be a related work, titled Arrach√© de ‚Ä¶ commentaire en forme de lecture du Temps restitu√©, but it did not extend beyond a preliminary sketch for clarinets on three staves and the entry of an SATB chorus marked \\"Sprechstimme. Imprecise pitches but different in pitch register\\" . Analysis The work is in five movements, performed without a break: #\\"La loi et le temps\\" (Law and Time) #\\"Symbole de nuit\\" (Symbol of Night) #\\"Portail de la terreur\\" (Gate of Terror) #\\"L‚Äôinach√®vement sans cesse\\" (Unceasing Incompletion) #\\"Car ce n‚Äôest que par l‚Äôerreur\\" (Because Only Amidst Error) It is scored for solo mezzo-soprano, a choir of twelve solo singers, and an orchestra of twenty-eight players made up of roughly equal numbers of woodwinds, strings, and percussion . The text is taken from a passage in Broch's novel where Virgil, alone in his room, late at night, contemplates the stars from his window. It is a meditation on the marriage of law and time, of the inevitable and the unpredictable . It follows the linear arrangement of about six pages of Broch's text. The texts of the first, third, and fifth movements are three elegies in verse, taken without alteration from Broch's novel. The second and fourth movements intersperse lightly edited prose passages from Broch's surrounding narrative framework. Barraqu√©'s omissions from the prose texts avoid many typical Brochian stylistic features in favour of its distinctive rhythm, retaining aspects of designation, assertion, and description. The syntax of the French translation permits Barraqu√© to end on the words \\"ouvert √† la connaissance\\" (open to perception), which would not have been possible in the German original. In this way, \\"r√©confort terrestre\\" (consolation in the earthly) becomes more important than the opening to perception . The first movement opens with an orchestral introduction, followed by a four-voiced chorus in shifting tempos. The second movement is slower, with the solo soprano singing for the first time, against an orchestral accompaniment. The movement ends with the words \\"lib√©r√©e du hasard\\" (freed from chance) which, in Broch's novel, lead directly into the second elegy. The third movement, setting this elegy, is longer and more complex, questioning how eternal truth is to be found within human mutability. The chorus sings four independent layers of text in twelve parts, \\"colliding and chaotic\\" (according to the score's instructions) against the soprano's cantabile, then adopts a more settled four-part texture to complete the movement as an aria with choral accompaniment. The fourth movement returns to the slower tempo and fragmented manner of the second movement, only now adding the chorus to the soprano and orchestra. It consists of two large sections of text setting, separated by a two-minute wordless interlude for chorus and orchestra. The concluding text once again ends with the words Broch uses to introduce the following elegiac verse ‚Äúcar ce n'est que dans l'erreur, ce n'est que par erreur‚Äù (because only amidst error, it is only through error). The final verse setting is slower still, though with constantly changing tempos. The soloist appears less often in this movement, while the choir is texturally more complex, at one point presenting twelve different lines of text simultaneously .

A cycloparaphenylene is a molecule that consists of several benzene rings connected by covalent bonds in the para positions to form a hoop- or necklace-like structure. Its chemical formula is or Such a molecule is usually denoted [n]CPP where n is the number of benzene rings. An \\"armchair\\" carbon nanotube and a cycloparaphenylene molecule. A cycloparaphenylene can be considered as the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotube, and is a type of carbon nanohoop. Cycloparaphenylenes are challenging targets for chemical synthesis due to the ring strain incurred from forcing benzene rings out of planarity.  History  In 1934 by V. C. Parekh and P. C. Guha described the first published attempt to synthesize a cycloparaphenylene, specifically [2]CPP. They connected two aromatic rings with a sulfide bridge, and hoped that removal of the latter would yield the desired compound. However, the attempt failed as the compound would have been far too strained to exist under anything but extreme conditions. First attempts at a CPP By 1993, Fritz V√∂gtle attempted to synthesize the less- strained [6]CPP and [8]CPP by the same approach. He produced a hoop of phenyl rings, bridged together by a sulfur atom. However, his attempts to remove the sulfur failed too. They also synthesized a macrocycle that upon dehydrogenation would yield a CPP, but could not perform this final step.. In the year 2000, Chandrasekhar and others concluded, by computational analysis, that [5]CPP and [6]CPP should be significantly different in their aromaticity. However, the synthesis in 2014 of [5]CPP refuted this conclusion. In 2008 the first cycloparaphenylenes were synthesized by Ramesh Jasti during his post doctoral research in the lab of Carolyn Bertozzi. He used cyclohexa-1,4-dienes which are closer in oxidation state to the desired phenylene than the cyclohexanes used previously by V√∂gtle. The first cycloparaphenylenes that were reported and characterized were: [9]CPP, [12]CPP, and [18]CPP. In 2009, the Itami group would report the selective synthesis of [12]CPP, and shortly thereafter Yamago synthesized [8]CPP in 2010. The Jasti Group then synthesized all increasingly smaller CPPs using new methodology that allowed [7]CPP, [6]CPP, and finally [5]CPP to be reported in relatively quick succession.  Properties  = Structure = The normal configuration of each phenylene element would be planar, with the bonds in the para position pointing opposite to each other in a straight line. Therefore, the cycloparaphenylene molecule is strained, and the strain increases as the number of units decreases. The strain energy of [5]CPP was calculated as 117.2 kcal/mol. In spite of the strain, the phenyl rings retain their aromatic character, even in the [5]CPP. However, as the size of the CPP decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap also decreases. This trend opposite to that observed in linear polyparaphenylenes where the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases as size increases. This causes a red-shift of the fluorescent emission. = Solid-state packing = Cycloparaphenylenes with 7 to 12 rings all adopt a herringbone-like packing in the solid state. A similar but denser structure was observed for [5]CPP, whereas [6]CPP forms columns. This columnar packing structure has been of interest due to a potentially high internal surface area. By partial fluorination, it was found that this packing geometry could be engineered.  Synthesis  There are three main methods used for cycloparaphenylene synthesis. =Suzuki Coupling of Curved Oligophenylene Precursors= In the initial synthesis, cycloparaphenylenes with n = 9, 12, and 18 have been synthesized starting from macrocycles containing 1,4-syn-dimethoxy-2,5-cyclohexadiene units as masked aromatic rings. Lithium‚Äìhalogen exchange with p-diiodobenzene followed by a two-fold nucleophilic addition reaction with 1,4-benzoquinone yielded a syn- cyclohexadiene moiety. Borylation of this material followed macrocyclization under Suzuki‚ÄìMiyuara cross-coupling with an equivalent of the diiodide produced macrocycles in low yields which could be separated by column chromatography. These macrocycles were then reductively aromatized using sodium naphthalenide to yield [n]cycloparaphenylenes. Since this initial synthesis uses symmetric building blocks it is challenging to use it to make smaller CPPs. Therefore, instead of benzoquinone, benzoquinone monomethyl ketal was used to allow the use of asymmetric building blocks. This innovation allowed the selective synthesis of [12]CPP to [5]CPP. [5]CPP is synthesized with an intramolecular boronate homocoupling technique that was originally seen as an undesired by-product of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in the synthesis of [10]CPP. Cycloparaphenylenes now have selective, modular, and high yielding synthetic pathways. =Reductive Elimination of Platinum Macrocycles= A quicker route to [8-13]CPPs starts by selectively building [8]CPP and [12]CPP from the reaction of 4,4‚Ä≤-bis(trimethylstannyl)biphenyl and 4,4‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤-bis(trimethylstannyl)terphenyl, respectively, with Pt(cod)Cl2 (where cod is 1,5-cyclooctadiene) through square-shaped tetranuclear platinum intermediates. A mixture of [8-13]cycloparaphenylenes can be obtained in good combined yields by mixing biphenyl and terphenyl precursors with the platinum sources. =Alkyne Cyclotrimerization= A third lesser used method developed in the Tanaka group uses rhodium catalyzed alkyne cyclotrimerization for the synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes.  Potential applications  Potential applications of cycloparaphenylenes include host‚Äìguest chemistry, seeds for carbon nanotube growth, and hybrid nanostructures containing nanohoop-type substituents. A cycloparaphenylene can be seen as minimal single-walled carbon nanotube of the armchair type. As such, a cycloparaphenylene may be a seed for synthesis of longer nanotubes. Their electronic properties may also be useful. = Fullerene binding = Cycloparaphenylenes have shown affinity to fullerenes and other carbonaceous molecules, with interactions similar to those in carbon peapods. Potential applications of these structures include nanolasers, single electron transistors, spin-qubit arrays for quantum computing, nanopipettes, and data storage devices. Specifically, the œÄ-œÄ interactions and the concave interior of the cycloparaphenylenes is expected to bind to œÄ conjugated systems with convex surfaces that can fit inside the ring. Indeed, [10]CPP has been shown to selectively bind a C60 fullerene within its hole, thus producing a \\"molecular bearing\\". The fullerene remains in the ring long enough to be observed on the NMR timescale. The fluorescence of [10]CPP is quenched upon complexation with C60, which suggests its potential as a C60 sensor. In 2018 this affinity was exploited to create CPP- fullerene rotaxanes. It has been observed that such \\"ball-in-hoop\\" interactions are stronger for endohedral metallo-fullerenes, in which a positively charged metal ion is trapped inside a fullerene cage and makes it more electronegative. Specifically, [12]CPP was found to preferentially enclose metallo-fullerenes instead of \\"empty\\" fullerenes, reducing their solubility in toluene; which provides a convenient separation method for the two species.  Related compounds  As the synthesis of CPPs has become easier, derivative structures have begun to be synthesized as well. In 2013 the Itami group reported the synthesis of a nanocage made completely of benzene rings. This compound was especially interesting because it could be viewed as a junction of a branched nanotube structure. Other chiral derivatives of cycloparaphenylenes (which may serve as chemical templates for synthesizing chiral nanotubes) have also been characterized. Similar to the original (n,n) cycloparaphenylenes, these chiral nanorings also exhibit unusual optoelectronic properties with excitation energies growing larger as a function of size; however, the (n+3,n+1) chiral nanoring exhibits larger photoinduced transitions compared to the original (n,n) cycloparaphenylenes, resulting in more readily observable optical properties in spectroscopic experiments. In 2012 the Jasti Group reported the synthesis of dimers of [8]CPP linked by arene bridges. This synthesis was followed two years later by the synthesis of a directly connected dimer of [10]CPP from chloro[10]CPP by the Itami group. = Donor‚Äìacceptor functionalization = CPPs are unique in that their donor‚Äìacceptor properties can be adjusted with the addition or removal of each phenyl ring. In the all-carbon nano-hoop systems a reduction in width corresponds to a higher HOMO and a lower LUMO. Additional donor‚Äìacceptor selectivity was observed by the addition of an aromatic heterocycles into the larger ring. N-methylaza[n]CPP showed that a lowering of the LUMO could be enhanced by decreasing the ring size, while the HOMO energy level remained the same.

Inaugurated in 1917 under the command of Regia Marina, the station remained in Navy service for much of the Second World war and then lost its importance until the disposal and transformation of its premises into civilian flats.  History  The center was established towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century to intensify communications with the colonies Italian on the Red Sea. What is left of Radio San Paolo The chosen location was along Via Ostiense across from the current building at number 204 in an uninhabited area and about 250 meters beyond the basilica of St. Paul in the direction of the sea. The systems, installed under the supervision of Giancarlo Vallauri and marine lieutenants Giuseppe Pession and Bernardo Micchiardi, were high-power long wave arched Poulsen transmitters (250 kW) functioning at frequencies from 42.9 to 27.3 kHz (7,000 to 11,000 meters wavelength). As antenna, a triangular set-up with three 200-meter-high iron trusses was used along the Valco di San Paolo. At the time these transmitters were able to reach the radio stations of Massaua and Mogadiscio. The radio was also used for civil purposes, in particular to keep in touch with the diplomatic corps abroad. To deal with the problems of disruption and monsoons that occurred on the eastern coast of Africa, the station was also equipped with a shortwave transmitter of 6 kW at 32 meters(~ 9 300 kHz) and 66 meters (~ 4 500 kHz), together with a long wave system at 10,750 meters (28 kHz) and medium wave systems at 2,250 (~ 133 kHz) and 4,800 meters (~ 62 kHz). These were installed in 1928. St. Paul became a famous radio station in 1928 while maintaining contact with support ship The City of Milan. This research ship was manned by Umberto Nobile and his crew and was active in the northern Atlantic after the disaster of the airship Italy in the North Pole region. Young Soviet Nikolay Schmidt captured an SOS signal transmitted by the Marxist expedition of Giuseppe Biagi near Arkhangelsk after days of unsuccessful attempts. Schmidt made contact with the San Paolo station. The station then coordinated efforts and assisted The City of Milan to establish direct contact with the survivors of the crew. Relief was then brought by the Soviet icebreaker Krasin. After 8 September 1943 and the fall of Rome into German hands the radio, which as a strategic objective ensured communications with most of the fleet, was militarily occupied by the Nazi troops.

The little bay with difficult overland access but with abundant springs had always been a favorite stopping place and shelter for the ones sailing along the coast: mariners, soldiers, merchants and pirates. The city of Oricum, located 12 km to the north, was founded in the 7th century BC, and the inhabitants started to use the Grama Bay as a quarry in the 3rd century BC from where they could extract limestone of good quality. The first inscriptions carved into the eastern rock face of the bay were made by the quarry workers themselves. During the following 2,000 years further mariners made their signs on the rock which ended up in the former quarry covered by 1,500 inscriptions. Majority is written in Ancient Greek and Latin, but inscriptions in Messapian language as well as ones made by Byzantine Greeks or Ottoman Turks are also included. These typically give the name of the people and that of their vessels and often invoke the Dioscuri. Historical figures also showed up in the Grama Bay and put their marks on the rock, such as Pompey in 48 BC or John V Palaiologos in around 1369. The Roman statesman Sulla was actually never visiting the bay, but in 86 BC after defeating Mithridates VI of Pontus during the First Mithridatic War he ordered to commemorate his triumph with a new inscription made on the Grama Bay's rocks. The medieval inscriptions call upon the Lord for his help. Those arriving to the Grama Bay after the 15th century continued the tradition of making their own graffito, but these pieces are of less archaeological value. Most considerably one can see inscriptions made by the hands of Himariotes during the 19th-20th centuries as well as graffito of Enver Hoxha's soldiers in the second half of the 20th century.

Translation rights have been sold in Czech, Estonian, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Dutch, and Polish. Movie rights have been optioned to Vocab Films with Toni Collette attached to play the role of Angelina. The novel follows the rekindling of a love affair and the impact on the long-term relationships of Adam and his former lover, Angelina. Music ‚Äì largely popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s ‚Äì features heavily in the book, and the publishers provide a playlist intended to enhance the reading experience. Synopsis Adam Sharp is an English information technology consultant and part-time piano player, in a settled but tired long-term relationship with Claire. He nurses a nostalgia for his \\"Great Lost Love\\"‚ÄîAngelina, with whom he had a brief affair twenty-two years ago during a work assignment in Melbourne, Australia. Then Angelina gets back in touch and Adam‚Äôs life is thrown into confusion. The novel is narrated from Adam‚Äôs point of view and is in two parts. Part I describes the present- day (2012) aftermath of Angelina‚Äôs re-connecting, with extensive flashbacks to their time in Melbourne. After their email interactions develop into a long- distance affair, Adam decides to leave Claire and accept an invitation to spend a week with Angelina and her husband Charlie at their vacation home in France. In Part II, Adam discovers that he is a player in a complex marital game. The narrative focuses on his efforts to understand Charlie and Angelina‚Äôs motivations, and on his decision as to whether to reunite with Angelina. Film Vocab Films optioned rights to The Best of Adam Sharp ‚Äî including a screenplay also by Simsion ‚Äî in May, 2017 with Toni Collette attached to play the role of Angelina. Role of music Simsion has stated that he set out to write a book with a soundtrack and the appendix lists 47 songs, predominantly from the 1960s and 1970s. Reception Critical reception for The Best of Adam Sharp has been divided. The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald praised it as \\"a dark comedy of manners, an adult entertainment that extends the range of his first, more light-hearted book\\"; The Daily Review‚Äôs positive assessment commented that it had the tight edge of a Woody Allen film and that \\"some of it is quite lovely and moving; some of it is funny and much of it is unsettling.\\" The Washington Post described Part I as a \\"fun sweet ride\\" but felt that the playlist in Part II could not rescue the \\"ill-considered\\" plot. The Australian compared it unfavourably with The Rosie Project, criticizing its nostalgic sentimentality, relieved only by occasional flashes of Simsion's \\"droll best\\".

However, the signal was not received by the support ship, but was caught in distance of 2,400 km by Russian radio amateur Nikolaj Schmidt (ru). Schmidt reported it to the authorities, who then informed Radio San Paolo in Rome. Large scale rescue operation followed, and finally Soviet ice-breaker Krassin saved Biagi and the others on July 12. Biagi still continued his work as a non-commissioned officer of the Navy, and then retired. In the last few years of life and opened a petrol station on the Via Ostiense, on the outskirts of Rome.

It did not go into production. Design and Development The MS.152 was designed to meet a government requirement for an aircraft which was powerful enough to carry the equipment required to train the crews of observation and bomber aircraft, and to act as medical and liaison aircraft, but without the high running expenses of the engines of the front-line aircraft of the day. Instead of these, the MS.152 could accept a variety of engines producing about . Like many Morane-Saulnier aircraft, it had a parasol wing. but some components like the wings and undercarriage were new and designed to be simple. The parasol wing of the MS.152 was in two parts, which were straight- edged with constant thickness and chord. They were swept at about 7¬∞ but mounted without dihedral. These fabric covered panels were of mixed construction, with twin metal spars but wooden ribs, false spars and leading edges. Each was supported just beyond mid-span by pairs of streamlined, duralumin tube struts converging downwards from the spars to a frame mounted on the fuselage. This was formed by a parallel pair of horizontal struts from the lower fuselage and a second, similar pair angled down from the upper fuselage. The wing was held over the fuselage on a cabane consisting of two N-struts from the central wing panel joint to the upper fuselage at its two forward principal frames. The MS.152's nose-mounted, , nine-cylinder Salmson 9Ab radial engine appears uncowled in photographs. The engine bearings were designed to accept other radial engines of similar powers. Fuel and oil tanks were in the fuselage, which was built around four duralumin tube longerons, joined by metal frames to the rear of the cockpits and with a polygonal dural tube structure behind. The forward section was metal-skinned, with fabric aft. The pilot's cockpit was under a deep trailing edge cut-out, easing access and providing an upward field of view. He controlled a machine gun fitted to the port side of the fuselage. Behind him was a second cockpit which could be fitted out in different ways, for example with radio or photographic equipment or for gunnery with twin Lewis guns on a flexible mount plus a synchronised Vickers machine gun, or with night-flying equipment. The empennage of the MS.152 was conventional, with its horizontal tail, almost rectangular in plan and of high aspect ratio, mounted on the upper fuselage. Its fin was quadrantal in profile and carried a tapered rudder down to the keel. The control surfaces were unbalanced. It had conventional, fixed landing gear with a track. Each mainwheel was on a cranked axle hinged on the lower fuselage, with a drag strut fixed further aft. Its faired, rubber ring-damped landing leg was almost vertical and attached to the forward part of the wing strut mounting frame. Operational history The date of the first flight of the MS.152 is not known but a photograph shows it complete by November 1928. It is not mentioned in the French aeronautical press after January 1929, so its development history is unknown. Both Caudron and Hanriot had competed with Morane-Saulnier to supply the liaison and multi-role trainer aircraft and the French Air Force selected the Hanriot H.43.

The concept originates with Melvin Goldstein who first reported about it in 1967. It is of some importance in academic research. Using MO theory the bicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienyl cation was predicted to be destabilised and the corresponding anion predicted to be stabilised by bicycloaromaticity. Bicycloaromaticity has been studied by others in relation to the bicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienyl cation and in relation to specific carbanions. In 2017 experimental evidence was reported for bicycloaromaticity (dual aromaticity) to exist in a bicyclic porphyrinoid. This system has been described as aromatic with two ring systems of 26 (n=6) and 34 (n=8) electrons. By oxidation, another system was described as a triplet-state biradical, again considered aromatic by application of Baird's rule.
