Between 1896 and his death, White became a spokesman for middle America. At a 1937 banquet held in his honor by the Kansas Editirial Association, he was called \\"the most loved and most distinguished member\\" of the Kansas press. Early life Born in Emporia, Kansas, White moved to El Dorado, Kansas, with his parents, Allen and Mary Ann Hatten White, where he spent the majority of his childhood. He loved animals and reading various books. He attended the College of Emporia and the University of Kansas, and in 1889 started work at The Kansas City Star as an editorial writer. The Emporia Gazette In 1895, White bought the Emporia Gazette for $3,000 from William Yoast Morgan and became its editor. =What's the matter with Kansas? – 1896= White was a political conservative at this early stage of his career. In 1896 a White editorial titled \\"What's the Matter With Kansas?\\" attracted national attention with a scathing attack on William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats, and the Populists. White sharply ridiculed Populist leaders for letting Kansas slip into economic stagnation and not keeping up economically with neighboring states because their anti-business policies frightened away economic capital from the state. White wrote: > \\"There are two ideas of government,\\" said our noble Bryan at Chicago. \\"There > are those who believe that if you legislate to make the well-to-do > prosperous, this prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic > idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their > prosperity will find its way up and through every class and rest upon them.\\" > That's the stuff! Give the prosperous man the dickens! Legislate the > thriftless man into ease, whack the stuffing out of the creditors and tell > the debtors who borrowed the money five years ago when money \\"per capita\\" > was greater than it is now, that the contraction of currency gives him a > right to repudiate.David Hinshaw, A Man from Kansas: The Story of William > Allen White (1945) p 108. The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the editorial in support of William McKinley during the intensely fought presidential election of 1896, providing White with national exposure. White 1920–1925 With his warm sense of humor, articulate editorial pen, and uncommon sense approach to life, White soon became known throughout the country. His Gazette editorials were widely reprinted; he wrote stories on politics syndicated by the George Matthew Adams Service; and he published many books, including biographies of Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge. \\"What's the Matter With Kansas?\\" and \\"Mary White\\" -- a tribute to his 16-year-old daughter on her death in 1921, portraying her as an anti-flapper -- were his best-known writings. Locally he was known as the greatest booster for Emporia. He won a 1923 Pulitzer Prize for his editorial \\"To an Anxious Friend\\", published July 27, 1922, after being arrested in a dispute over free speech following objections to the way the state of Kansas handled the men who participated in the Great Railroad Strike of 1922. =Small-town ideals= In his novels and short stories, White developed his idea of the small town as a metaphor for understanding social change and for preaching the necessity of community.Griffith (1989) While he expressed his views in terms of the small town, he tailored his rhetoric to the needs and values of emerging urban America. The cynicism of the post-World War I world stilled his imaginary literature, but for the remainder of his life he continued to propagate his vision of small-town community. He opposed chain stores and mail order firms as a threat to the business owner on Main Street. The Great Depression shook his faith in a cooperative, selfless, middle-class America. Like most old Progressives his attitude toward the New Deal was ambivalent: President Franklin D. Roosevelt cared for the country and was personally attractive, but White considered his solutions haphazard. White saw the country uniting behind old ideals by 1940, in the face of foreign threats.Agran (1998) Fighting corruption White sought to encourage a viable moral order that would provide the nation with a sense of community. He recognized the powerful forces of corruption but called for slow, remedial change having its origin in the middle class. In his novel In the Heart of a Fool (1918), White fully developed the idea that reform remained the soundest ally of property rights. He felt that the Spanish–American War fostered political unity, and believed that a moral victory and an advance in civilization would be compensation for the devastation of World War I. White concluded that democracy in the New Era inevitably lacked direction, and the New Deal found him a baffled spectator. Nevertheless, he clung to his vision of a cooperative society until his death in 1944.Richard W. Resh, \\"A Vision in Emporia: William Allen White's Search for Community,\\" Midcontinent American Studies Journal 1969 10(2): 19-35 Politics Time cover, 6 Oct 1924 White became a leader of the Progressive movement in Kansas, forming the Kansas Republican League in 1912 to oppose railroads.Griffith ch 5 White helped Theodore Roosevelt form the Progressive (Bull-Moose) Party in 1912 in opposition to the conservative forces surrounding incumbent Republican president William Howard Taft. White was a reporter at the Versailles Conference in 1919 and a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations. The League went into operation but the U.S. never joined. During the 1920s, White was critical of both the isolationism and the conservatism of the Republican Party. According to Roger Bresnahan: > White's finest hour came in his vigorous assault, beginning with Gazette > editorials in 1921, on the Ku Klux Klan – a crusade that led him to run for > governor of Kansas in 1924 so that his anti-Klan message would reach a > broader state and national audience. As expected, White did not win the > election, but he was widely credited with deflating Klan intentions in > Kansas. In the 1930s he was an early supporter of the Republican presidential nominees, Alf Landon of Kansas in 1936, and Wendell Willkie in 1940. However, White was on the liberal wing of the Republican Party and wrote many editorials praising the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sponsoring painter John Steuart Curry White was the leader in persuading Kansas newspaper editors and publishers to run a fund-raising campaign so as to invite Kansas's most famous artist, John Steuart Curry, to paint murals for Kansas. He got the support of Governor Walter Huxman and other politicians, and the result was the prestigious invitation to paint murals for the Kansas Capitol. The result was Tragic Prelude. Sage of Emporia The last quarter century of White's life was spent as an unofficial national spokesman for Middle America. This led President Franklin Roosevelt to ask White to help generate public support for the Allies before America's entry into World War II. In 1940 White was fundamental in the formation of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, sometimes known as the White Committee. He had to fight the powerful America First faction, which believed, like most other Republicans, that the U.S. should stay out of the war. White spent much of his last three years involved with this committee. Sometimes referred to as the Sage of Emporia, he continued to write editorials for the Gazette until his death in 1944. He was also a founding editor of the Book of the Month Club along with longtime friend Dorothy Canfield. Family White married Sallie Lindsay in 1893. They had two children, William Lindsay, born in 1900, and Mary Katherine, born in 1904. Mary died in a 1921 horse-riding accident, prompting her father to write a famous eulogy, \\"Mary White,\\" on August 17, 1921. White visited six of the seven continents at least once in his long life. Due to his fame and success, he received 10 honorary degrees from universities, including one from Harvard. White taught his son William L. the importance of journalism, and after his death, William L. took charge of the Gazette and continued its local success. William L.'s wife, Kathrine, ran it after he died. Their daughter, Barbara, and her husband, David Walker, took it over much as WilliamKansans.com had earlier, and today the paper remains family-run, currently headed by WAW's great-grandson, Christopher White Walker. White and the Two Roosevelts White developed a friendship with President Theodore Roosevelt in the 1890s that lasted until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Roosevelt spent several nights at White's Wight and Wight-designed home, Red Rocks, during trips across the United States.The house is now a museum and is on the National Register of Historic Places. White was to say later, \\"Roosevelt bit me and I went mad.\\" Later, White supported much of the New Deal, but voted against Franklin D. Roosevelt every time.

They unsurprisingly chose to name it after their most famous citizen, William Allen White. This bomber was sent with a crew of men to the island of Tinian in the South Pacific and was part of the same bomber squadron that the Enola Gay was in. During World War Two, the William Allen White Liberty ship was launched from Richmond, California on May 8, 1944. His autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1946 won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. US postage stamp, 1948 In 1948 a 3¢ stamp was made in his honor by the U.S. Postal Service. The University of Kansas Journalism School is named for him, as is the library building at Emporia State University. There are also two awards the William Allen White Foundation has created: The William Allen White Award for outstanding Journalistic merit and the Children's Book Award. The town of Emporia honors him to this day with city limits signs on I-35, US-50, and K-99 announcing \\"Home of William Allen White.\\" White's image is used by the band They Might Be Giants in stagecraft and music videos.

These architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures and were a revolution in style and the model for a generation of sculptors. Later Gothic depiction of the Adoration of the Magi from Strasbourg Cathedral. Gothic sculpture, late 15th century, Amiens Cathedral. Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture. It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Northern, Southern and Central Europe, never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy. In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century. In many areas, especially Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century, before being subsumed into Renaissance art. Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco and illuminated manuscripts. The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic, and Gothic to Renaissance styles, are typically used to define the periods in art in all media, although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace. The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture, on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys. Christian art was often typological in nature (see Medieval allegory), showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side. Saints' lives were often depicted. Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, cuddling her infant, swaying from her hip, and showing the refined manners of a well-born aristocratic courtly lady. Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities, foundation of universities, increase in trade, the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts. Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art. With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters' guild. As a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names. Origins 14th Century International Gothic Mary Magdalene in St. John Cathedral in Toruń. Gothic art emerged in Île-de-France, France, in the early 12th century at the Abbey Church of St Denis built by Abbot Suger.Stokstad (2005), 516. The style rapidly spread beyond its origins in architecture to sculpture, both monumental and personal in size, textile art, and painting, which took a variety of forms, including fresco, stained glass, the illuminated manuscript, and panel painting.Stokstad (2005), 544. Monastic orders, especially the Cistercians and the Carthusians, were important builders who disseminated the style and developed distinctive variants of it across Europe. Regional variations of architecture remained important, even when, by the late 14th century, a coherent universal style known as International Gothic had evolved, which continued until the late 15th century, and beyond in many areas. Although there was far more secular Gothic art than is often thought today, as generally the survival rate of religious art has been better than for secular equivalents, a large proportion of the art produced in the period was religious, whether commissioned by the church or by the laity. Gothic art was often typological in nature, reflecting a belief that the events of the Old Testament pre-figured those of the New, and that this was indeed their main significance. Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, and the decoration of churches. The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion, in which the visual arts played a major part. Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types, through the Coronation of the Virgin, to more human and intimate types, and cycles of the Life of the Virgin were very popular. Artists like Giotto, Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy, and Early Netherlandish painting, brought realism and a more natural humanity to art. Western artists, and their patrons, became much more confident in innovative iconography, and much more originality is seen, although copied formulae were still used by most artists. Iconography was affected by changes in theology, with depictions of the Assumption of Mary gaining ground on the older Death of the Virgin, and in devotional practices such as the Devotio Moderna, which produced new treatments of Christ in subjects such as the Man of Sorrows, Pensive Christ and Pietà, which emphasized his human suffering and vulnerability, in a parallel movement to that in depictions of the Virgin. Even in Last Judgements Christ was now usually shown exposing his chest to show the wounds of his Passion. Saints were shown more frequently and altarpieces showed saints relevant to the particular church or donor in attendance on a Crucifixion or enthroned Virgin and Child, or occupying the central space themselves (this usually for works designed for side-chapels). Over the period many ancient iconographical features that originated in New Testament apocrypha were gradually eliminated under clerical pressure, like the midwives at the Nativity, though others were too well-established, and considered harmless.Émile Mâle, The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, pp. 165–8, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions) is a classic work on French Gothic church art Etymology The word \\"Gothic\\" for art was initially used as a synonym for \\"Barbaric\\", and was therefore used pejoratively. Its critics saw this type of Medieval art as unrefined and too remote from the aesthetic proportions and shapes of Classical art. Renaissance authors believed that the Sack of Rome by the Gothic tribes in 410 had triggered the demise of the Classical world and all the values they held dear. In the 15th century, various Italian architects and writers complained that the new \\"barbarian\\" styles filtering down from north of the Alps posed a similar threat to the classical revival promoted by the early Renaissance.E. S. de Beer, Gothic: Origin and Diffusion of the Term; The Idea of Style in Architecture in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol.11, 1948, pp. 143–62 The \\"Gothic\\" qualifier for this art was first used in Raphael's letter to Pope Leo X c. 1518 and was subsequently popularised by the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari, who used it as early as 1530, calling Gothic art a \\"monstrous and barbarous\\" \\"disorder\\".The art of the sublime: principles of Christian art and architecture by Roger Homan p. 70 Raphael claimed that the pointed arches of northern architecture were an echo of the primitive huts the Germanic forest dwellers formed by bending trees together – a myth which would resurface much later in a more positive sense in the writings of the German Romantic movement. \\"Gothic art\\" was strongly criticized by French authors such as Boileau, La Bruyère, Rousseau, before becoming a recognized form of art, and the wording becoming fixed. Molière would famously comment on Gothic: > The besotted taste of Gothic monuments, These odious monsters of ignorant > centuries, Which the torrents of barbary spewed forth. In its beginning, Gothic art was initially called \\"French work\\" (Opus Francigenum), thus attesting the priority of France in the creation of this style. Painting Simone Martini (1285–1344). French late Gothic frescos. Painting in a style that can be called Gothic did not appear until about 1200, nearly 50 years after the origins of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and not at all a clear break, and Gothic ornamental detailing is often introduced before much change is seen in the style of figures or compositions themselves. Then figures become more animated in pose and facial expression, tend to be smaller in relation to the background of scenes, and are arranged more freely in the pictorial space, where there is room. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220 and Italy around 1300. Painting during the Gothic period was practiced in four primary media: frescos, panel paintings, manuscript illumination and stained glass. =Frescoes= Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. An accident of survival has given Denmark and Sweden the largest groups of surviving church wall paintings in the Biblia pauperum style, usually extending up to recently constructed cross vaults. In both Denmark and Sweden, they were almost all covered with limewash after the Reformation which has preserved them, but some have also remained untouched since their creation. Among the finest examples from Denmark are those of the Elmelunde Master from the Danish island of Møn who decorated the churches of Fanefjord, Keldby and Elmelunde.Kirsten Trampedach: Introduction to Danish Wall Paintings – Conservation Ethics and Methods of Treatment. National Museum of Denmark . Retrieved 6 September 2009. Albertus Pictor is arguably the most well-known fresco artist from the period working in Sweden. Examples of Swedish churches with well-preserved frescos include Tensta, Gökhem and Anga churches. =Stained glass= In northern Europe, stained glass was an important and prestigious form of painting until the 15th century, when it became supplanted by panel painting. Gothic architecture greatly increased the amount of glass in large buildings, partly to allow for wide expanses of glass, as in rose windows. In the early part of the period mainly black paint and clear or brightly coloured glass was used, but in the early 14th century the use of compounds of silver, painted on glass which was then fired, allowed a number of variations of colour, centred on yellows, to be used with clear glass in a single piece. By the end of the period designs increasingly used large pieces of glass which were painted, with yellows as the dominant colours, and relatively few smaller pieces of glass in other colours.Coe, 8–11 =Manuscripts and printmaking= Illuminated manuscripts represent the most complete record of Gothic painting, providing a record of styles in places where no monumental works have otherwise survived. The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century.Stokstad (2005), 540. Many such illuminated manuscripts were royal bibles, although psalters also included illustrations; the Parisian Psalter of Saint Louis, dating from 1253 to 1270, features 78 full-page illuminations in tempera paint and gold leaf.Stokstad (2005), 541. Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, by Jean Pucelle, Paris, 1320s. During the late 13th century, scribes began to create prayer books for the laity, often known as books of hours due to their use at prescribed times of the day. Among the earliest is an example by William de Brailes that seems to have been written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240. Nobility frequently purchased such texts, paying handsomely for decorative illustrations; among the most well-known creators of these is Jean Pucelle, whose Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux was commissioned by King Charles IV as a gift for his queen, Jeanne d'Évreux.Stokstad (2005), 542. Elements of the French Gothic present in such works include the use of decorative page framing reminiscent of the architecture of the time with elongated and detailed figures. The use of spatial indicators such as building elements and natural features such as trees and clouds also denote the French Gothic style of illumination. From the middle of the 14th century, blockbooks with both text and images cut as woodcut seem to have been affordable by parish priests in the Low Countries, where they were most popular. By the end of the century, printed books with illustrations, still mostly on religious subjects, were rapidly becoming accessible to the prosperous middle class, as were engravings of fairly high quality by printmakers like Israhel van Meckenem and Master E. S. In the 15th century, the introduction of cheap prints, mostly in woodcut, made it possible even for peasants to have devotional images at home. These images, tiny at the bottom of the market, often crudely coloured, were sold in thousands but are now extremely rare, most having been pasted to walls. =Altarpiece and panel painting= Painting with oil on canvas did not become popular until the 15th and 16th centuries and was a hallmark of Renaissance art. In Northern Europe the important and innovative school of Early Netherlandish painting is in an essentially Gothic style, but can also be regarded as part of the Northern Renaissance, as there was a long delay before the Italian revival of interest in classicism had a great impact in the north. Painters like Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck made use of the technique of oil painting to create minutely detailed works, correct in perspective, where apparent realism was combined with richly complex symbolism arising precisely from the realistic detail they could now include, even in small works. In Early Netherlandish painting, from the richest cities of Northern Europe, a new minute realism in oil painting was combined with subtle and complex theological allusions, expressed precisely through the highly detailed settings of religious scenes. The Mérode Altarpiece (1420s) of Robert Campin and the Washington Van Eyck Annunciation or Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (both 1430s, by Jan van Eyck) are examples.Lane, Barbara G,The Altar and the Altarpiece, Sacramental Themes in Early Netherlandish Painting, Harper & Row, 1984, analyses all these works in detail. See also the references in the articles on the works. For the wealthy, small panel paintings, even polyptychs in oil painting were becoming increasingly popular, often showing donor portraits alongside, though often much smaller than the Virgin or saints depicted. These were usually displayed in the home. Sculpture =Monumental sculpture= French ivory Virgin and Child, end of the 13th century, 25 cm high, curving to fit the shape of the ivory tusk. The Gothic period is essentially defined by Gothic architecture, and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large tympanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them. The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral (c. 1145) show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south transept portal, from 1215–20, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition. These trends were continued in the west portal at Reims Cathedral of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe.Honour and Fleming, 297–300; Henderson, 55, 82–84 Bamberg Cathedral has perhaps the largest assemblage of 13th century sculpture, culminating in 1240 with the Bamberg Rider, the first life-size equestrian statue in Western art since the 6th century. In Italy Nicola Pisano (1258–78) and his son Giovanni developed a style that is often called Proto-Renaissance, with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265–68), the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, and Giovanni's pulpit in Pistoia of 1301.Olson, 11–24; Honour and Fleming, 304; Henderson, 41 Another revival of classical style is seen in the International Gothic work of Claus Sluter and his followers in Burgundy and Flanders around 1400.Snyder, 65–69 Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large, wooden, sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere. Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences.Snyder, 305–311 Life-size tomb effigies in stone or alabaster became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the Scaliger Tombs of Verona so large they had to be moved outside the church. By the 15th century there was an industry exporting Nottingham alabaster altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables.V&A; Museum feature on the Nottingham alabaster Swansea Altarpiece File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPGSouth portal of Chartres Cathedral (c. 1215–20).

Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres. Types of ivories included small, devotional polyptychs, single figures, especially of the Virgin, mirror-cases, combs, and elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances, used as engagement presents.Calkins, 193–198 The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate, jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the Duc de Berry's Holy Thorn Reliquary, until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash.Cherry, 25–48; Henderson, 134–141 Gothic sculptures independent of architectural ornament were primarily created as devotional objects for the home or intended as donations for local churches,Stokstad (2005), 537. although small reliefs in ivory, bone and wood cover both religious and secular subjects, and were for church and domestic use. Such sculptures were the work of urban artisans, and the most typical subject for three dimensional small statues is the Virgin Mary alone or with child.Stokstad (2005), 539. Paris was the main centre of ivory workshops, and exported to most of northern Europe, though Italy also had a considerable production. An exemplar of these independent sculptures is among the collections of the Abbey Church of St Denis; the silver-gilt Virgin and Child dates to 1339 and features Mary enveloped in a flowing cloak holding an infantile Christ figure. Both the simplicity of the cloak and the youth of the child presage other sculptures found in northern Europe dating to the 14th century and early 15th century. Such sculpture shows an evolution from an earlier stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic feel in the late 12th and early 13th century. Other French Gothic sculptural subjects included figures and scenes from popular literature of the time. Imagery from the poetry of the troubadours was particularly popular among artisans of mirror-cases and small boxes presumably for use by women. The Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) of 1330–50 is an unusually large example with space for a number of scenes from different literary sources. Souvenirs of pilgrimages to shrines, such as clay or lead badges, medals and ampullae stamped with images were also popular and cheap. Their secular equivalent, the livery badge, showed signs of feudal and political loyalty or alliance that came to be regarded as a social menace in England under bastard feudalism. The cheaper forms were sometimes given away free, as with the 13,000 badges ordered in 1483 by King Richard III of England in fustian cloth with his emblem of a white boar for the investiture of his son Edward as Prince of Wales,Cherry (2003), 204 a huge number given the population at the time. The Dunstable Swan Jewel, modelled fully in the round in enamelled gold, is a far more exclusive version, that would have been given to someone very close or important to the donor.

Pedro García de Benabarre, Salome from the St John Retable, Catalonia, 1470–1480. Tudor gown showing the line of the Spanish farthingale: portrait of Catherine Parr, 1545. Silhouette of the 1590s: Elizabeth I, the Ditchley portrait A farthingale is one of several structures used under Western European women's clothing in the 16th and 17th centuries to support the skirts in the desired shape and enlarged the lower half of the body. It originated in Spain in the fifteenth century. Farthingales served important social and cultural functions for women in Renaissance Europe as they were used, primarily by court women, to show their high social position and wealth. This is because these structures increased the amount of expensive fabrics used in the gowns that covered them.  Spanish farthingale  The Spanish verdugado, from which \\"farthingale\\" derives, was a hoop skirt originally stiffened with esparto grass; later designs in the temperate climate zone were stiffened with osiers (willow withies), rope, or (from about 1580) whalebone. The name verdugado comes from the Spanish verdugo (\\"green wood\\", or the more modern meaning of \\"executioner\\"). The earliest sources indicate that Joan of Portugal started to use verdugados with hoops in Spain. Joan had provoked much criticism as she allegedly wore dresses that displayed too much décolletage, and her wanton behaviour was considered scandalous. When she started to use farthingales, court fashion followed suit. As Joan had two illegitimate children by Pedro de Castilla y Fonseca, rumors abounded that she used the farthingale to cover up a pregnancy. The earliest images of Spanish farthingales show hoops prominently displayed on the outer surfaces of skirts, although later they merely provided shape to the overskirt. Catherine of Aragon brought the fashion into England on her marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, in 1501. However, there is little evidence to show that she continued to wear this fashion as she adopted English styles of dress. One of the first references to a farthingale in England comes from the accounts of Princess Elizabeth in 1545 that described a farthingale made of crimson Bruges satin. Spanish farthingales were an essential element of Tudor fashion in England. The French educated Mary, Queen of Scots had a black taffeta \\"verdugalle\\" in 1550,Marguerite Wood, Foreign Correspondence with Marie of Lorraine: Balcarres Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1925), p. xxvii. and a set of fashion dolls with 15 farthingales.Michael Pearce, Dolls of Mary Queen of Scots: Edinburgh Castle Research (Edinburgh, 2018), p. 18 Whale bone was bought to shape her farthingales in 1562.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland: 1559-1566, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1916), p. 204. Farthingales remained a fixture of conservative Spanish court fashion into the early 17th century (as exemplified by Margaret of Austria), before evolving into the guardainfante of 17th-century Spanish dress.  French farthingale Roll  French farthingales, c. 1580 French farthingales originated in court circles in France and they first appeared in England during the 1570s. On 17 March 1577 the English ambassador to Paris, Amyas Paulet, sent a new type of farthingale to Queen Elizabeth I stating that it was “such as is now used by the French Queen and the Queen of Navarre.” Janet Arnold has stated that this new style was probably a roll that sat on top of the cone-shaped Spanish farthingale. Randle Cotgrave, in his Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (1611), defined the French farthingale as “the kind of roll used by such women as weare no Vardingales.” Several wardrobe accounts and tailors' bills of the late 16th century give us an idea of what these rolls were made of: they were stuffed with cotton and rags, and stiffened with hoops of whalebone, wire or ropes made of bent reeds. Buckram (stiff canvas) is the most commonly mentioned material. Other references describe the rolls being starched.Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Accounts, MS Egerton 2806, lists the materials used for rolls made by the royal farthingale maker. Here are a couple of sample references to rolls from Queen Elizabeth I's Wardrobe Accounts (MS Egerton 2806): :* (1585) :* (1586) There are no extant examples of this style of undergarment, and only one illustration, a satirical Dutch engraving of c1600, that shows the bum-roll being affixed by a tiring- woman.Illustration, from Harold Koda, \\"Extreme Beauty: The Body Transformed, exhibition catalog (Metropolitan Museum of Art) 2001. From contemporary references, and the visual cues provided by the engraving, it appears to have consisted of a bolster-like roll either stuffed or held out with reeds which, being fastened around the hips, served the purpose of widening the skirts at the hip area, creating drapes. Some modern costumers conjecture that the French farthingale and the \\"great farthingale\\" were one and the same garment, the difference in shape and construction being due to changes in fashion from the 1580s to the 1590s. French Wheel Farthingale or Great Farthingale A second style of French farthingale, also known as the wheel, great, drum or cartwheel farthingale, became fashionable in England during the 1590s . It seems to have consisted of several hoops made from whalebone that graduated outwards from the level of the waistline in a wheel shape. This structure was often supported by a padded roll underneath, and was distinct in appearance from the other French farthingale roll, as it had a hard edge from which the skirts dramatically fell. Although there are also no surviving examples of this type of garment, there are a number of references to a \\"Great Farthingale\\" in Queen Elizabeth I's wardrobe accounts during the time when this style was in vogue. \\"Great\\" in this context referring to the large circumference of the farthingale which was required in order to achieve the fashionable silhouette. The great farthingale appears to have been worn at an angle (\\"low before and high behind\\") which visually elongated the wearer's torso while shortening her legs. The angle was likely created by the use of bodies (corsets) or boned bodices with long centre fronts that pushed down on the farthingale, tilting it. Such an effect has been shown in many reconstructions of the garment. Some historians have raised doubts about the size of these garment, which some contemporaries claimed could be as wide as 1.4 metres. Instead they claim that the seemingly enormous size of these garments was an optical illusion created by wearing it with a pair of bodies (corset) that elongated and streamlined the torso. Criticisms of farthingales are also indicative of spatial anxieties relating to fears about these garments creating intimate personal spaces around the female body, masking the appropriation of social status, and physically displacing men. These fears continued into the eighteenth and nineteenth century, where tropes about the size of hoop petticoats (panniers) and crinolines continued. Farthingales for Queen Elizabeth were made by a specialist Robert Sibthorpe. Anne of Denmark had her gowns altered in 1603 to suit English fashions, and employed Robert Hughes to make farthingales from 1603 to 1618.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 124-9. Large styles of French farthingale remained popular in England and France until the 1620s when they disappeared in portraiture and wardrobe accounts. They were replaced by small rolls or bum-rolls that persisted throughout the rest of the seventeenth century. In Spain, the Spanish farthingales evolved into the guardainfante and remained an identifiable part of Spanish dress until the eighteenth century. A well-known anecdote concerning farthingales dates from the end of this period. It was said that in 1628 Elizabeth Wyche, daughter of the mayor of London Richard Saltonstall and wife of the English ambassador Peter Wyche in Constantinople astonished Ayşe Sultan, wife of Murad IV, with her farthingale and she wondered if all English women had such an unusual shape. This story may been composed in condemnation of the fashion.Francis Peck, Desiderata Curiosa, vol. 1 (London, 1779), p. 575 quoting John Bulwer, Anthropometamorphosis (London, 1650), pp. 546-7 Farthingale sleeves In England, sleeves were enlarged and shaped with a whale bone armature, worn as a support underneath wide sleeves, and these were called \\"farthingale sleeves\\" or \\"vardingall sleeves.\\" An account from William Jones for making a gown for Queen Elizabeth includes, \\"a payer of vardingall sleves of holland cloth bented with whals bone and covered with riben.\\"HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 14 (London, 1923), p. 47 Another account from Jones, for the queen's dwarf Tomasen in 1597 includes a \\"paier of verthingale slevis of fustian.\\" Jones made many pairs of farthingale sleeves in the 1580s, perhaps for the women of Elizabeth's court.Janet Arnold, Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd (Leeds, 1988), pp. 108, 146, 153.

Tailplanes and canard foreplanes are not normally included in this count, although they may be occasionally. Design principles Front view of a triplane The triplane arrangement may be compared with the biplane in a number of ways. A triplane arrangement has a narrower wing chord than a biplane of similar span and area. This gives each wing-plane a slender appearance with higher aspect ratio, making it more efficient and giving increased lift. This potentially offers a faster rate of climb and tighter turning radius, both of which are important in a fighter. The Sopwith Triplane was a successful example, having the same wing span as the equivalent biplane, the Sopwith Pup. Alternatively, a triplane has reduced span compared to a biplane of given wing area and aspect ratio, leading to a more compact and lightweight structure. This potentially offers better maneuverability for a fighter, and higher load-capacity with more practical ground handling for a large aircraft type. The famous Fokker Dr.I triplane offered a balance between the two approaches, having moderately shorter span and moderately higher aspect ratio than the equivalent biplane, the Fokker D.VI. Yet a third comparison may be made between a biplane and triplane having the same wing plan: the triplane's third wing provides increased wing area, giving much-increased lift. The extra weight is partially offset by the increased depth of the overall structure, allowing a more efficient construction. The Caproni Ca.4 and Levy-Besson families of large, multi- engined triplanes both had some success with this approach. A scale model of a Caproni Ca.60 flying boat. These advantages are offset to a greater or lesser extent in any given design by the extra weight and drag of the structural bracing and by the loss of lift resulting from aerodynamic interference between the wings in any stacked configuration. The multiplane idea was taken a step further by the quadruplane. No examples were successful, and as biplane design advanced, it became clear that the disadvantages of the triplane and quadruplane outweighed their advantages. In a practical landplane design, the lower set of wings are typically set approximately level with the underside of the aircraft's fuselage, the middle set level with the top of the fuselage, and the top set supported above the fuselage on cabane struts. In a practical flying boat, even the lowest wing must be placed well above the waterline of the hull, creating a tall structure overall. History The first heavier- than-air craft to carry a person in free flight was a triplane, as far back as 1848 and long before the advent of powered flight. One of the few Danish designs to fly, in 1907, and the first powered type to fly in Germany, was also a triplane. However the triplane has seldom proved a practical solution and few types have ever entered production. The majority of triplane designs emerged during a narrow period from 1908 to 1923. Besides the famous fighting triplanes of the First World War, several larger types became successful bombers, airliners and maritime patrol aircraft, sometimes as different variants of the same basic design, both during and immediately after the war. The last triplane design, a private homebuild, was introduced shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. =Pioneer years= A British Roe III Triplane in the United States in September 1910 with its designer, Alliot Verdon Roe, in the cockpit. The first heavier-than-air machine to carry a human on a free, untethered flight was a triplane glider constructed by George Cayley and flown in 1848. It was modern in form, having three stacked wings above the fuselage and a separate stabilising tail with both fin and tailplane. The wings were of typical Cayley kite-like planform having a low aspect ratio. The craft was not large enough to carry an adult so a local boy was chosen as the passenger, but his name is not known.Wragg, D.; Flight before flying, Osprey, 1974, Page 60 Between 1907 and 1911 a number of pioneers experimented with triplanes, some capable of flight and others not. None proved outstanding, although the series produced by A.V. Roe had some success and sold in small numbers. In 1907 the Danish pioneer Jacob Ellehammer flew a powered triplane and would later receive a prize for flying it in Germany. The French Bousson-Borgnis canard triplane of 1908 was a failure. The Goupy No.1, designed in 1908 by Ambroise Goupy and built by Voisin, was more successful. A few weeks after the Goupy No.1 flew, Hans Grade's triplane became the first German-built aeroplane to fly. In the same year Farman modified his original Voisin machine to triplane configuration, and Dorand constructed a military triplane. In 1909 the American Morris Bokor constructed his own canard triplaneFlight, 26 June 1909, Page 380 and the Frenchman Alfred Groos constructed a triplane which failed to fly. Through 1909 and 1910 the British aviation pioneer A.V. Roe built a series of four experimental triplanes--types I, II, III and IV--and selling a small number of his Type II and III designs, before abandoning the triplane. Alexander Graham Bell was experimenting with an \\"octahedral\\" wing design and in 1910 built a triplane example, the Oionus I, which failed to fly. In 1911 the Belgian César Battaille constructed a triplane capable of short flights or hops, and the Russian Rodjestveisky also constructed a triplane. =The fighting triplanes= The Sopwith Triplane, the first triplane to see service in World War I. A flyable reproduction of the Fokker Dr.I of World War I, the best known triplane. During World War I, some aircraft manufacturers turned to the triplane configuration for fighter aircraft. In practice these triplanes generally offered inferior performance to the equivalent biplane and, despite a brief vogue around 1917, only four types saw limited production. Nieuport built a series of triplane prototypes between 1915 and 1917, featuring a top wing heavily staggered backwards to improve the pilot's view and a characteristic triangular strut arrangement bracing the three wings. The design resulted in poor handling and was eventually dropped. Sopwith developed three different triplane designs in 1916. One, known simply as the Sopwith Triplane, went into production and became the first military triplane to see operational service. It had equal-span wings of high aspect ratio, mounted on a fuselage very similar to that of the preceding Pup biplane, and braced by one sturdy strut on each side with minimal wire bracing. The type was ordered by both the RFC and RNAS, but the RFC traded theirs for another type and the Sopwith saw service only with the RNAS, where it served with success. The Sopwith type's performance advantage and early successes over the Albatros D.III spurred military interest in the design, especially in Germany and Austria-Hungary. A flurry of fighter prototypes were produced through 1917 and 1918, sometimes reluctantly under pressure from the military. Examples were produced by Albatros, Aviatik, Brandenburg, DFW, Euler, Fokker, Friedrichshafen, LFG Roland, Lloyd, Lohner, Oeffag, Pfalz, Sablating, Schütte- Lanz, Siemens-Schuckert, W.K.F, in Britain by Austin and in the US by Curtiss. Only two companies, Fokker and Curtiss, would see any of their designs into production. Fokker's V.4 prototype of 1917 (identified by some as the V.3) had unusual cantilevered wings without bracing, the uppermost wing being attached only by cabane struts to the fuselage. The wings vibrated excessively in flight and the next prototype, the V.5, featured a single interplane strut on each side, similar to the Sopwith but with no wires called shrouds. This became the prototype of the famous Fokker Dr.I triplane of 1917, which would become immortalised as the aircraft most closely identified in popular culture with Manfred von Richthofen, the \\"Red Baron\\". Although it had a good rate of climb and was highly manoeuvrable it was not particularly fast. Following the break-up of two examples in the air the type was withdrawn from service for strengthening, and by the time it was re-introduced it was no longer at the forefront of performance. Meanwhile, in the USA the Curtiss company produced many triplane designs between 1916 and 1918. Of these, several fighters and related types entered production, notably the Model L trainer (of which three examples were constructed as floatplanes) and the Model S and Model 18-T fighters. The Curtiss GS-1 prototype of 1918 was unusual in being a floatplane scout from the outset. The performance of the fighting triplanes was soon overtaken by improved biplane fighters. However, as late as 1919 three prototype Sopwith Snarks were flown, and in 1920 and 1921 the heavily armoured Boeing GA-1 and GA-2 ground-attack triplanes proved too heavy to be useful. =Zeppelin killers= A few British designers pursued the triplane configuration in the anti-Zeppelin role. From 1915, Armstrong Whitworth developed the F.K.5 and F.K.6 prototypes. These were large three-seat types with twin engines and the middle wing of noticeably longer span than the others. Then in 1917 Blackburn produced their single-seat triplane. It was something of a throwback, featuring a pusher propeller and boom-mounted empennage in the manner of an earlier era. The arrangement was intended to allow fitting of an upwards-firing 2-pounder recoilless gun in the forward fuselage. Neither type progressed beyond the prototype stage. =Bombers, transports and patrol= The French began experimenting with bomber designs in 1915. The Morane-Saulnier TRK and Voisin Triplane prototypes of 1915 and 1916 were not successful. The Voisin design was unusual in having a subsidiary tail boom above the fuselage, helping to support the empennage. French triplanes had more success in the long-range maritime role. Labourdette-Halbronn produced a twin-hulled triplane torpedo bomber prototype, the H.T.1, in 1918 and two prototypes of a modified H.T.2 version in 1919. Besson designed several triplane flying boats between ca. 1917 and 1919, initially in partnership with Levy. The Levy-Besson Alerte of 1917 featured a central wing of greater span than the others and many examples were used for ASW and patrol duties. Their last such design, the 1919 Levy-Besson High Seas had the top wing extended to the same span as the central wing and was also ordered into production, although the run was cancelled after relatively few had been delivered. Besson split from Levy and created his own Besson LB maritime patrol flying boat in the same year, and also the Besson Hydravion école which he exhibited at the Paris 1919 Air Show. He later developed a number of smaller designs for other roles, including Besson H-6 mail plane flown in 1921. A Caproni Ca.48 airliner. The Italian Caproni Ca.4 of 1917 was another successful design and entered service with the Italian air force as a heavy bomber in 1918. Many further variants were produced, both during and after the war. Caproni later re-numbered many of these variants as new types, including the Ca.48 airliner. In Italy's first commercial aviation disaster and one of the earliest - and, at the time, deadliest - airliner accidents, a Ca.48 crashed while flying over Verona, Italy, on August 2, 1919, killing everyone on board (between 14 and 17 people).\\"The Caproni Disaster\\" Flight, August 7, 1919, p. 1053, (flightglobal.com)Venice Airport Lido: On the Wings of the SparrowGuttman, p. 55. The unsuccessful Caproni Ca.60 prototype transatlantic seaplane had three sets of triplane wings taken from the Ca.4, making nine wings in all, and is generally classified as a multiplane. Among the many large seaplane designs produced in the US by Curtiss between 1916 and 1918, several were triplanes, however none entered production, including the Wanamaker Triplane prototype. Britain, too, gained its first triplane bomber in 1917 with the single-engined Sopwith Rhino. It was not a success and the Sopwith Cobham, the only twin-engined type that Sopwith ever produced, fared little better two years later. From 1918, the British company Bristol developed a series of heavy triplanes which, like the Caproni design, appeared in different variants aimed at different roles.Oughton, J.D.; Bristol an aircraft album, Ian Allan, 1973. The first was the Bristol Braemar bomber, flying in 1918 with the Mk II version in 1919. The Bristol Pullman 14-seat transport variant flew in 1920. This was followed by two examples of a new, larger design for a military freighter known as the Bristol Tramp. The Tarrant Tabor, another and much larger British bomber, was built with three wings to carry the six engines required--four more-powerful engines being unavailable. The power imbalance due to the high mounting caused the Tabor to crash on its maiden flight in 1919. Its designer Walter Barling went on to design the similar-sized American Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1 triplane, known as the \\"Barling Bomber\\", which first flew in 1923. On a smaller scale, the Avro 547 airliner was a modified Avro 504 with an extra wing. Two were built, of which the first flew in 1920. It was sold to Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services but proved unsuited to the tough conditions in the Australian Outback. Britain's only triplane contribution to the maritime arena was the Felixstowe Fury prototype of 1918, also known as the Porte Super-Baby. Almost as late as the Barling Bomber, in 1922 the Japanese flew the Mitsubishi 1MT torpedo bomber. It entered production as the Navy Type 10. =The racing triplanes= After World War I, several examples of the Curtiss 18-T were used for racing. An 18T-2 nearly won the Curtiss Marine Trophy Race in 1922 (limited to U.S. Navy pilots), but pilot Sandy Sanderson ran out of fuel just before the finish line.Berliner, Don. \\"A Concise History of Air Racing.\\" Society of Air Racing Historians, 9 January 2007. Retrieved: 13 January 2011. In 1921 the \\"Cactus Kitten\\" racing triplane was created by modifying the \\"Texas Wildcat 2\\" biplane (which in turn was a modification of the monoplane \\"Texas Wildcat\\" monoplane), thus becoming the only design in history to have gone from monoplane to biplane to triplane configuration. Also referred to as the Curtiss-Cox racer, being designed and sponsored by Cox from Texas and powered by a 435 hp Curtiss C-12 engine, the Cactus Kitten had a wingspan of 20 ft. In the 1922 Pulitzer race it came 2nd behind a Curtiss biplane. In its triplane configuration it surpassed its monoplane and biplane antecedents in handling and speed and, for a brief period in 1922, the triplane was once again being noticed with the Kitten being touted as the world's fastest plane and being capable of surpassing 200 miles per hour. The same year it was donated to the Navy and used as a trainer for the 1922 Pulitzer race, fame having proven very fleeting. In 1927 a Catron & Fisk CF-10 twin-engined 22-seat airliner was modified with additional fuel tanks and updated engines and named the Pride of Los Angeles. The intention was to enter the Dole Air race, but an in-flight incident caused the aircraft to crash before the race started. =Private aviation= Some triplanes have been developed for private use. Perhaps the most unusual was the 1917 Curtiss Autoplane, a triplane flying car. The same year, the more conventional Curtiss-Judson Triplane, a one-off and slightly enlarged triplane variant of the Curtiss Model F, was sold for private use. After the war, in France the Besson H-3 private tourer flew in 1921. And in 1923 the German hang-glider enthusiast Hans Richter flew a triplane variant. Following the craze for the homebuilt tandem-wing Mignet Pou du Ciel (Flying Flea), a triplane variant, the American Flea, was produced in America around 1939. In this variant the top wings were fixed and the bottom wing acted as all-flying ailerons. Tandem triplanes The Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano in 1921. A tandem triplane has two sets of triplane wings, fore and aft. Few have been made. The Dufaux triplane of 1908 was Switzerland's first native aircraft design, configured as a tandem triplane with a smaller biplane horizontal stabiliser. The 1909 Roe I Triplane has also been described as a tandem triplane \\"A. V. Goes Back\\" Flight, 2 July 1954, p.2 due to its relatively large triplane aft plane. The Fokker V.8 of 1917 was another tandem design although not a true tandem triplane, having a triplane fore wing, biplane rear wing and monoplane tail stabiliser. In 1921, the Italian Gianni Caproni mated three stacks of triplane wings from his Ca.4 series to a single fuselage in a tandem triple triplane arrangement, to create the Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano prototype transatlantic airliner. It proved unstable and crashed on its second flight. A further example was under construction in Kansas City, USA as late as 1922.Popular mechanics, August 1922, p. 175. Recently, the term \\"tandem triplane\\" has been used for some new monoplane types that have active \\"canard\\" foreplane surfaces in addition to conventional wings and horizontal tailplane. A configuration having three comparable lifting surfaces in tandem is more correctly referred to as a three surface aircraft, or sometimes a tandem triple or tandem triplet, and is not a triplane as such. These modern types may also be compared to the pioneer Voisin-Farman I and Curtiss No. 1 which also had a large main wing with smaller fore and aft planes; the smaller planes were not regarded as part of the main wing arrangement, and they were not described as tandem types.

Darren Shan is the main character in O'Shaughnessy's The Saga of Darren Shan young adult fiction series, also known as the Cirque Du Freak series in the United States. He followed that up with The Demonata series and the stand-alone books, Koyasan and The Thin Executioner. Then came The Saga of Larten Crepsley which is a prequel to The Saga of Darren Shan and tells the life of Larten Crepsley. His next multi-book series was Zom-B and in April 2020 he started his new Archibald Lox series. Shan also writes for adults, and has published The City Book Trilogy and Lady of the Shades under the name of Darren Shan, and The Evil and the Pure, Sunburn, An Other Place, Midsummer's Bottom, and Molls Like it Hot under the name of Darren Dash. Early life and education Shan was born in St Thomas's Hospital in London, opposite the Houses of parliament. At the age of three, he started school at English Martyrs' near the Elephant and Castle where he lived. When he was six, he moved with his parents and younger brother, to Limerick in Ireland, where he has lived ever since. He received his primary education in Askeaton, and attended secondary school at Copsewood College, Pallaskenry, graduating in 1989. He returned to London in 1990 to pursue a degree in Sociology and English from Roehampton University. Career Shan bought his first typewriter when he was fourteen and wrote many short stories, comic scripts, and books that he never finished, many of which are unpublished. Shan claims that most of these stories will never be published. His first success came to him at age fifteen, when he was a runner-up in a TV script-writing competition for RTÉ in Ireland, with a dark comedy story entitled A Day in the Morgue. After university, Shan worked in a TV cable company in Limerick for two years, before becoming a full-time writer at the age of 23. His breakthrough came with Ayuamarca, released under his real name (Darren O'Shaughnessy). It was published in February 1999 by Orion Publishing Group. The sequel, Hell's Horizon, was published in February 2000. Ayuamarca was re-released in March 2008 under the title Procession of the Dead and the pen-name D.B. Shan. Hell's Horizon followed in March 2009, and the third in the trilogy, City of the Snakes in March 2010 (but this time under the name of Darren Shan). In January 2000, Shan released Cirque du Freak, the first book of The Saga of Darren Shan series in the UK and Ireland. The series was a huge global success and by 2019 his books were on sale in 40 countries, in 32 languages, and had sold in excess of twenty-five million copies worldwide. Shan signed up with the Christopher Little Literary Agency in 1996 and they have continued to represent him and his novels up to the present day. Personal life Shan continues to live in Pallaskenry in Limerick, Ireland with his wife Dr Helen Basini, a freelance university lecturer and global aid specialist. On 23 September 2014, the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Dante, named after the famous Italian author. Shan and his wife Helen welcomed their second child, a daughter named Gaia, on 26 March 2019. Books = The Saga of Darren Shan= Also known as Cirque Du Freak series.

There will be three volumes in total in the series.  Volume One  * Archibald Lox and the Bridge Between Worlds * Archibald Lox and the Empress of Suanpan * Archibald Lox and the Vote of Alignment = Stand-alone books =  Koyasan  A short novel released for World Book Day in the UK in 2006. The paperback edition is out of print, but it is available in ebook format through Kindle on Amazon stores worldwide. It has also been translated and released in several other countries.  The Thin Executioner  A one-off novel, The Thin Executioner was released in April 2010. Inspired in part by The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and based in a brutal, fantastical world, it details the perilous quest of Jebel, the thin son of a respected executioner, to petition a fire god for invincibility, so that he can succeed his father. Shan has stated that this is his favourite out of all of the books he has written.  Lady of the Shades  Lady of the Shades was released in the UK and Ireland on 30 August 2012.  Hagurosan  A short story originally released in a book collection called Kids Night In in the UK in 2003. Shan tweaked and slightly expanded it ten years later, and it was released as a book by the publishing group Barrington Stoke with illustrations by Zack McLaughlin. =Darren Dash= In 2014, Shan started publishing his books for adults under the name of Darren Dash, so that they would not be confused with his children's books. The first, in 2014, was The Evil and the Pure, followed by Sunburn in 2015, An Other Place in 2016, Midsummer's Bottom in 2018, and Molls Like it Hot in 2019. Shan plans to write the rest of his adult books under this pen name from this point onwards. =Online short spin-off stories= * \\"An Essay on Vampires\\" \\"by\\" Steve Leopard – book 1 tie-in story. * \\"Annie's Diary\\" – book 1 tie-in story. * \\"Tiny Terrors\\" – book 2 tie-in story. * \\"Transylvania Trek\\" – a short story \\"written\\" by Sam Grest. * \\"Shanta Claus\\" (only available at Christmas) * \\"Lonely Lefty\\" – book 3 tie-in story. * \\"Bride of Sam Grest\\" – another short story \\"written\\" by Sam Grest. * \\"An Affair of the Night\\" – book 5 tie-in story (should be read just before or after book 5). =Short stories= # \\"Hagurosan\\" – Originally written for Kids' Night In. # \\"Young Alan Moore\\" – Originally written for Alan Moore: Portrait of an Extraordinary Gentleman, a book written to celebrate the 50th birthday of Alan Moore. # \\"The Good Ship Tree\\" – Originally written for the Times Educational Supplement, and accepted. # \\"Life's a Beach\\" – Originally written for the Times Educational Supplement, but rejected. # \\"Guyifesto—Who We Are\\" – Originally written for Guys Write For Guys Read.

Most of those have now been published, although there are several which have yet to see the light of day, which he plans to release in the future, most probably under his Darren Dash umbrella. There are also a few that will very likely never be published. Shan has not revealed details of any of his unpublished books, with two exceptions — Mute Pursuit and The Cannibal King: # Mute Pursuit – A futuristic cross between The Terminator and Stephen King's The Dark Tower; this was Shan's first completed book at age seventeen. # The Cannibal King – This was originally going to be the 12th book of The Saga of Darren Shan – book 11 was originally meant to be much longer, including elements from the first half of what became Sons of Destiny. The Cannibal King was never published because it was originally part of the planned 24-book Saga. Shan had planned to write 18—24 books for The Saga, with half of them taking place in the future wasteworld shown in Book 10, The Lake of Souls. For reasons explained on his web site, Shan decided to end the series with Sons of Destiny, which was written and released instead of The Cannibal King. He never reveals anything that he wrote in this book, because there is a possibility that he might one day write a follow-up series to The Saga, which would take parts of this book as its starting point. Film Universal Studios bought the film rights to the first three books of The Saga of Darren Shan and combined them to make a single film, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, released in the US on 23 October 2009. Lauren Shuler Donner produced the film and Paul Weitz directed. The original screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland but rewritten entirely by Paul Weitz.

Together with its associated ground control station, it is an unmanned aircraft system (UAS). Developed under the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program, the system is intended to provide real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions, continuous maritime surveillance, conduct search and rescue missions, and to complement the Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. Triton builds on elements of the RQ-4 Global Hawk; changes include reinforcements to the air frame and wing, de-icing systems, and lightning protection systems. These capabilities allow the aircraft to descend through cloud layers to gain a closer view of ships and other targets at sea when needed. The sensor suites allow ships to be tracked by gathering information on their speed, location, and classification.MQ-4C Triton: Persistent Maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance The MQ-4C System Development and Demonstration (SDD) aircraft was delivered in 2012 and the MQ-4C was expected to be operational by late 2015 with a total of 67 aircraft to be procured.

The Triton would have been the first unmanned aircraft to be fitted with such a system, but the system was behind schedule and over budget. The radar system remains a requirement in the program, but budgetary and technology pressures have forced the Navy to defer integrating it onto the aircraft. The Navy and Northrop Grumman are working to determine when the sense-and-avoid system can be included into the production line.US Navy pauses development of MQ-4C Triton 'sense and avoid' radar - Flightglobal.com, 15 August 2013 The Navy restarted the competition for a sense-and-avoid radar for the Triton in November 2014 with less ambitious requirements, including the ability to use data from ground radars as it approaches an airport, and a modular and scalable design that can be incrementally improved to meet evolving future operational and air traffic management requirements.US Navy restarts sense and avoid radar for MQ-4C - Flightglobal.com, 4 November 2014 On 6 September 2013, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $9.98 million contract for maintenance and support of the MQ-4C SDD aircraft to enable it to fly fifteen missions per month, an increase from nine per month as previously planned, with senior Navy commanders wanting to keep closer surveillance of activities in the ocean and coastal regions of the Middle East.U.S. Navy Expands Surveillance Mission for Northrop Grumman- Built Maritime Unmanned Aircraft - sUASNews.com, 19 September 2013 The Navy began considering in September 2014 cutting the number of Tritons it plans to buy. The intention has been to have twenty operational MQ-4C aircraft operational at any one time, with the rest of the sixty-eight-plane order force being spares. Due to the improved reliability of the aircraft, budget pressures may require the Navy to trim the numbers of aircraft it will order.Navy says may trim Northrop drone order due to better reliability - Reuters.com, 23 September 2014 In September 2015, the DoD Inspector General found the seventy-aircraft force requirement justified, based on available attrition rate estimates of four per 100,000 hours. The Navy intends to begin operation of one operating location every year starting in 2018 until there are five. Four Tritons will be operational at each base to maintain continuous flight, with the rest produced for testing, training, and loss replacement; the entire order is to be completed in 2032. =International sales= Australia Australia has considered the MQ-4, both as a military platform and as customs enforcement platform; senior customs officials have doubted the effectiveness of the planned seven MQ-4C to detect small boats in the country's northern waters, especially through cloud cover.UAV not best choice for finding boats - sUASNews.com, 3 July 2013 In 2013, Air Marshall Geoff Brown, head of the Royal Australian Air Force, stated that Australia was considering purchasing more manned P-8 Poseidon aircraft and reducing the number of MQ-4Cs planned to be bought for the RAAF.Australia plans to procure more P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) than planned, reducing MQ-4C Triton UAS order - Airrecognition.com, 18 July 2013 On 16 February 2014, it was reported that the Australian government would seek the purchase of seven MQ-4C Tritons; in addition to locating ships and aircraft, it would also be used to detect seaborne asylum seekers. Alongside the P-8, the MQ-4 is to replace the elderly P-3 Orion fleet.Australia to buy seven MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aircraft Systems - Navyrecognition.com, 16 February 2014 On 13 March 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced Australia's intention to buy the MQ-4C Triton and become its first foreign customer. The announcement was made at RAAF Base Edinburgh, the base of the country's fleet of eighteen AP-3C Orion aircraft it will replace. The Triton buy is part of the Australian Defence Force's Project Air 7000 two-phase Orion replacement program; Phase 1B entails procuring the Triton, and Phase 2B is the acquisition of eight-to- twelve manned P-8A Poseidons in 2017. RAAF Tritons and Poseidons will be used in a similar complementary fashion as with U.S. Navy operation, where the MQ-4C performs high-altitude broad area surveillance missions, allowing the P-8A to be more dedicated to anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, search and rescue response, and electronic intelligence missions. The Australian Government confirmed in its 2016 Defence White Paper that the Royal Australian Air Force was to acquire seven MQ-4C Triton aircraft as part of its \\"Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability stream\\". On 26 June 2018, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the purchase of the first of six MQ-4C Tritons with consideration being given to purchase a seventh. Melbourne Age. 26 June 2018 India Northrop Grumman has also proposed the MQ-4C to India; the Indian Navy have considered the UAV in a complementary role to the twelve Boeing P-8I Poseidons maritime patrol aircraft it has on order. Rumored sales  On 20 July 2014 there was a rumor that the UK planned to purchase a minimum eight MQ-4Cs to replace the cancelled BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 after defence chiefs stated that the UK's nuclear deterrent Trident may have been compromised to the Russians. In the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 there was no such mention of a buy and that report is negated. = Cancelled Orders = Germany In January 2015, the German Luftwaffe and Bundeswehr began considering the Triton to fill their signals intelligence (SIGINT) needs as a continuation of the cancelled Global Hawk-based EuroHawk program. After the retirement of the German Navy's five Br.1150 Atlantique aircraft in 2010, the EuroHawk was intended to fill the SIGINT gap, but was cancelled in May 2013 after spending €600 million ($750 million) from concerns of its ability to satisfy airworthiness regulations to permit flight over civil airspace in Europe. With about half of the investment on the electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) sensors, Germany is trying to get some form of the program into service. Using the Triton would ease integration by keeping the sensors in the same place, gondolas hung under the wings, which limited attempts to put them on other airframes due to reception problems with nearby engine placement. With icing and lightning-strike protection already included, the MQ-4C would have a better chance of achieving safety certification to fly over inhabited areas of Europe that previously ended the EuroHawk.Germany May Revive Euro Hawk Using MQ-4C , Aviation Week, 12 January 2015 The German Defence Ministry confirmed in March 2017 that it had decided to buy the MQ-4C to replace the EuroHawk program, with deliveries occurring after 2025.Germany to buy Triton drone to replace cancelled Euro Hawk - sources - Reuters.com, 7 March 2017 The German government has decided to purchase several modified Bombardier Global 6000 aircraft modified for the role instead of the Triton after officials became convinced that the Global Hawk derivatives would be unable to meet the safety standards needed for flying through European airspace by 2025 and saw their hopes dashed as Italy recently issued a military-type certificate for a sister drone — NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance fleet of Global Hawks — that prescribes tight restrictions on flights over the European continent. Manned aircraft like the envisioned Global 6000 are allowed to routinely fly alongside civilian traffic. Design The MQ-4C can remain aloft more than 30 hours at at speeds of up to . Its surveillance sensor is the AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) X-band AESA radar with a 360-degree field-of-regard, capable of surveying of sea (as well as shoreline or land) in a 24-hour period, or in a single sweep. Using the radar in inverse synthetic aperture mode, the MFAS can identify a target in all weather conditions. It can take high definition radar pictures, then use the advanced image and radar return recognition software of the onboard Automatic Identification System (AIS) to classify it without the intervention of aircraft operators. The Triton is semi-autonomous to conserve manpower, so operators only need to choose an operating area for the aircraft, and set speed, altitude, and objective rather than operating controls.The Navy Has The Ultimate MH370 Search Tool, It's Just Not Operational - Foxtrotalpha.Jalopnik.com, 18 March 2014 One thing the Triton was designed to do (that the Global Hawk cannot) is rapidly descend to lower altitudes. It is built with a more robust lower fuselage to withstand hail, bird, and lightning strikes. It is equipped with anti-icing systems on its wings. At low altitude, the Triton would use its Raytheon MTS-B multi-spectral EO/IR sensor (also used on the MQ-9 Reaper) which is equipped with additional laser designator, pointer, and range finding abilities capable of automatically tracking what the MFAS detects. The optical suite can stream live video to ground forces. The Triton is equipped with a modular electronic support measures (ESM) suite, similar to the one used on the Lockheed EP-3, to passively detect and classify faint radar signals. It is able to triangulate and geo-locate these signals, allowing mission planners to create an enemy \\"electronic order of battle\\" profile, or keep the aircraft and others outside the range of enemy radars and air defenses. Detecting and locating the source of radar signals would also be useful for locating military vessels at sea for potential targeting. Low- and high-band signals receivers to give it a multi-INT (SIGINT) capability will be fielded in 2021Pentagon prioritises EP-3 role for Triton - Flightglobal.com, 22 December 2016 as part of an integrated functional capability (IFC) 4 configuration; further changes are planned for IFC 5 upgrade in 2024. Another aspect of the MQ-4C is its ability to act as a network relay and data fusion center, able to receive and transmit messages from around a theater of operations between various sources not within line-of-sight of each other. It can take what ships, planes, and land sensors are seeing and broadcasting through various data-links and fuse that information together to create a common \\"picture\\" of the battlespace, which it can rebroadcast. This capability greatly increases interoperability, situational awareness, targeting efficiency, and sensor picture clarity, while providing an alternative to satellite-based communications systems.

Half of its envelope expansion testing, which included evaluating the aircraft at different altitudes, speeds, and weights, had been completed. Some flights lasted over 9 hours and reached 50,000 ft. A second Triton aircraft was to fly by March or April 2014.MQ-4C testing continues as USA considers broader mission - Flightglobal.com, 7 January 2014 Initial envelope expansion testing was completed in March 2014 through 13 flights, 81 flight hours, and reaching altitudes of 59,900 ft.MQ-4C Triton clears initial envelope expansion tests - Flightglobal.com, 25 March 2014 On 18 September 2014, the Triton successfully conducted an 11-hour cross-country flight from Northrop Grumman's Palmdale, California facility to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The cross-country flight test had been previously postponed twice due to bad weather. The aircraft flew a pre-approved instrument route along the southern U.S. border, crossing the Gulf of Mexico and Florida, then was directed north along the Atlantic coast and up the Chesapeake Bay, a distance of at to avoid commercial air traffic. A test fleet of three Tritons completed 15 flights demonstrating speed and altitude capabilities prior to the transcontinental mission. With the completion of the cross-country flight, the MQ-4C program transitions from initial safety flight testing to validating its ability to perform operational missions over the ocean. Operations from Patuxent River in the coming weeks will test the aircraft's sensors, communications, interoperability, and expanded envelope flight coverage. The three test Tritons are scheduled to fly a total of 2,000 hours before reaching initial operating capability.US Navy's Triton UAV makes first cross-country flight - Flightglobal.com, 18 September 2014 The second MQ-4C Triton model flew on 16 October 2014, 17 months after the first model's first flight. It is being prepped to perform the cross-country flight later in the month that the first aircraft performed the previous month. A third model is also bring prepared to start flights; the third was planned to be funded by the Navy but was lost to budget cuts, so Northrop Grumman decided to self-fund production of the third prototype.Northrop Grumman flies second MQ-4C prototype - Flightglobal.com, 16 October 2014 =Fleet operational evaluation and introduction= On 7 February 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that it would stand up Unmanned Patrol Squadron Nineteen (VUP-19) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida on 1 October 2013, to eventually operate the MQ-4C as the Navy's first Triton squadron. A detachment of VUP-19 will also be established at NAS Point Mugu, California. VUP-19 will fall under the administrative control of Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ELEVEN (CPRW-11) at NAS Jacksonville, where an MQ-4C mission control facility is also under construction, and will initially operate the Triton on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions for the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Southwest Asia/Middle East/East Africa region, the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, and U.S. Fleet Forces Command in western Atlantic operations. In 2014, the Navy will activate a second Triton squadron, VUP-11, to take over operations in the Pacific in support of U.S. 7th Fleet and share U.S. 5th Fleet operations with VUP-19. On 17 November 2015, the MQ-4C began a two-month operational assessment that will determine Milestone C approval and the start of low-rate initial production. In February 2016 the U.S. Navy confirmed that the MQ-4C had completed Operational Assessment, putting the Triton in line to achieve a Milestone C decision in spring 2016, leading to low rate production. An integrated test team made up of Navy personnel from Air Test and Evaluation Sqdns. VX-1 and VX-20, Unmanned Patrol Sqdn., VUP-19 and Northrop Grumman demonstrated Triton's reliability over approximately sixty flight hours. The Navy's fiscal 2017 budget request includes 19 MQ-4 Tritons through fiscal 2021, with first deployment to the Pacific in fiscal 2017. The tests evaluated the MQ-4C's key sensors – an active electronically scanned array radar, an electro-optic/infrared camera and a hydrocarbon detector – over different altitudes and ranges, analysing the \\"system’s ability to classify targets and disseminate critical data\\", according to Northrop. In 2013, the US Navy noted quality control issues in the MQ-4C's wings, which Northrop Grumman stated to have fixed by 2016. On 12 December 2019, the U.S. Navy stated that one of its RQ-4A Global Hawk aircraft had been damaged during a takeoff in the Middle East in November 2019. The craft, which cost $123 million in 2015, was estimated by USNI to be valued at $180 million by 2019. On 26 January 2020, VUP-19 deployed the MQ-4C for the first time, with two aircraft sent to Anderson AFB in Guam.MQ-4C Triton arrives in Pacific Region for first deployment.

This book describes his life from birth until leaving school, focusing on living conditions in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s, the public school system at the time, and how his childhood experiences led him to writing as a career. It ends with his first job, working for Royal Dutch Shell. His autobiography continues in the book Going Solo. An expanded edition titled More About Boy was published in 2008, featuring the full original text and illustrations with additional stories, letters, and photographs. Key points in the story =Dahl's ancestry= Roald Dahl's father Harald Dahl and mother Sophie Hesselberg were Norwegians who lived in Cardiff, Wales. Harald and his brother Oscar split up and went their separate ways, Oscar going to La Rochelle, while Harald had lost an arm from complications after fracturing it. A doctor was summoned, but was drunk on arrival and mistook the injury for a dislocated shoulder. His attempt to relocate the shoulder caused further damage to the fractured arm, necessitating an amputation. According to Dahl, his only serious problem was not being able to cut the top off a boiled egg. Harald Dahl had two children by his first wife, Marie, who died shortly after the birth of their second child. He then married Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg, Roald's mother. Harald was considerably older than Sofie; he was born in 1863 and she was born in 1885. By the time Roald Dahl was born in 1916, his father was 53 years old. =Family tragedy= When Roald was three years old, his seven-year-old sister Astri died of an infection from a burst appendix. Only weeks later, Roald's father died of pneumonia. As the narrator of the book, Dahl suggests his father died of grief from the loss of his daughter. Roald's mother was forced to choose between moving the family to Norway with her relatives or relocating to a smaller house in Wales to continue the children's education in the United Kingdom, and ended up choosing the latter which is what her late husband had wanted. =Primary school= Roald started at the Elm Tree House Primary School in Cardiff when he was 6 years old. He was there for a year, but has few memories of his time there because it was so long ago. =Sweets= Roald writes about different confectionery, his love of sweets, his fascination with the local sweet shop, and in particular, about the free samples of Cadbury chocolate bars given to him and his schoolmates when he was a pupil at Repton School. Young Dahl dreamt of working as an inventor for Cadbury, an idea he has said later inspired Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Some of the sweets sold at Mrs Pratchett's sweet shop were: Lemon sherbets, pear drops, and liquorice boot laces. =Great mouse plot of 1924= From the age of eight, Dahl attended Llandaff Cathedral School in Cardiff. He and his friends had a grudge against the local sweet-shop owner, Mrs Pratchett, a sour, elderly widow who gave no thought to hygiene (and described by Dahl's biographer, Donald Sturrock, as \\"a comic distillation of the two witchlike sisters who, it seems, ran the shop in real life\\"Sturrock, p. 48). They played a prank on her by placing a dead mouse in a gobstopper jar while his friend Thwaites distracted her by buying sweets. They were caned by the headmaster as a punishment. Mrs Pratchett, who attended the canings, was not satisfied after the first stroke was delivered and insisted the headmaster should cane much harder which he did: six of the hardest strokes he could muster while Mrs Pratchett beamed with great delight as each boy suffered his punishment. =St Peter's School, Weston-super- Mare= Roald attended St Peter's School, a boarding school in Weston-super- Mare from 1925, when he was nine, to 1929, when he was twelve. He describes having received six strokes of the cane after being accused of cheating at his classwork. In the essay about the life of a penny, he claims that he still has the essay and that he had been doing well until the nib of his pen broke - fountain pens were not accepted. He had to ask his classmate for another one, when Captain Hardcastle heard him and accused him of cheating. Many of the events he describes involved the matron. She once sprinkled soap shavings into Tweedie's mouth to stop his snoring. She also sent a six-year-old boy, who had allegedly thrown a sponge across the dormitory, to the headmaster. Still in his pyjamas and dressing gown, the little boy then received six strokes of the cane. Wragg, a boy in Roald's dormitory, sprinkled sugar over the corridor floor so they could hear that the matron was coming when she walked upon it. When the boy's friends refused to turn him in, the whole school was punished by the headmaster who confiscated the keys to their tuck boxes containing food parcels which the pupils had received from their families. In the end, he returns home to his family for Christmas. =Repton and Shell Oil Company= After St Peter's, Roald's mother entered him for either Marlborough or Repton, but he chose Repton because it was easier to pronounce. It is soon revealed Marlborough might have been a better choice: life at Repton was a living hell. The prefects, named Boazers as per school tradition, were utmost sadists and patrolled the school like secret police. The headmaster, Dahl describes an occasion when his friend received several brutal strokes of the cane from the headmaster as punishment for misbehaviour. According to Dahl, this headmaster was Geoffrey Francis Fisher, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London in 1939. However, according to Dahl's biographer, Jeremy Treglown, Dahl's memory was in error: the beating took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton. The headmaster concerned was in fact John Traill Christie, Fisher's successor.Treglown, p. 21 Despite this infernal school, Dahl did make friends with the Maths professor and a boy named Michael. Even one of the Boazers, Wilberforce, took a liking to Dahl. Despite this being punishment for Dahl's tardiness, Wilberforce was impressed by how Dahl warmed his lavatory seat that he hired him as his personal lavatory warmer. Dahl also excelled in sports and photography, something he says impressed various masters at the school. After school, Dahl worked for Shell, despite the headmaster trying to dissuade him because of his lack of responsibility. Dahl was nonetheless entered into the business and toured Britain in the job. He became a businessman in London and was content. However, he took a trip across Newfoundland which he says \\"was not much of a country\\" with some other boys and a man who had travelled to Antarctica with Scott. He was then assigned to go to Africa, but declined Egypt because it was \\"too dusty.\\" The manager instead selected Dahl for East Africa, delighting him. Roald Dahl sets off to Africa, now a young man, and unbeknownst to him, Adolf Hitler has become chancellor of Germany and will soon split the world in two.

Summary James Henry Trotter is a boy who lives with his parents in a house by the sea happily. Unfortunately, when he is four years old, an escaped rhinoceros from the zoo eats James's parents and he ends up with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. Instead of caring for him, they treat him badly, feed him improperly and force him to sleep on bare floorboards. After James had been living with his aunts for three years, he meets a mysterious man who gives him green beans and says that if he would drink it his life would change for the better. While going to his home he falls and the beans spill on a peach tree. The tree, in turn, produces a single peach which soon grows to the size of a house. Spiker and Sponge build fences around it and earn money by selling tickets to tourists, giving them the chance to see the peach. James is locked in his house and sees the peach through the bars of his bedroom window. After the tourists have gone, James is assigned to clean the rubbish and finds a tunnel in the peach. He enters it and meets Centipede, Miss Spider, Old Green Grasshopper, Earthworm, Ladybird, Glowworm, and Silkworm who become his friends. The next day, Centipede cuts the stem of the peach, causing it to roll down and fatally squash James's aunts. It reaches the sea where sharks surround it. James uses Miss Spider and Silkworm to make threads, while Earthworm is used as bait and draws 501 seagulls\\"How many seagulls would really be needed to carry Dahl's Giant Peach?\\" The Telegraph. Retrieved 25 November 2019. near the peach, whereupon the threads are tied on their necks. The peach is lifted off the water and Centipede falls down but is later rescued by James. The peach goes into the clouds and meet cloud men demons. Then Centipede mocks them which makes them angry, and they start throwing hailstones at the peach. James manages to pull the peach down on the lower part of the sky and realizes that they have reached New York City. People think it was a bomb and warn the others to evacuate. Police personnel and firemen arrive and see the peach, which causes some to faint. Then James comes and tells the whole story and becomes friends with many children in New York, and they eat the peach and James and his friends get their own jobs.

The cast included Simon Bell playing James, Bernard Cribbins playing Centipede, and Anna Quayle playing Aunt Spiker. Though Roald Dahl declined numerous offers during his life to have a film version of James and the Giant Peach produced, his widow, Felicity Dahl, approved an offer to have a film adaptation produced in conjunction with Disney in the mid-1990s. It was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton, both of whom previously produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. The movie consists of live action and stop-motion to reduce production finances. It was narrated by Pete Postlethwaite (who also played the wizard). The film was released on 12 April 1996.\\"James And The Giant Peach\\". bcdb.com, 23 March 2011 Though it was a box office flop, it received positive reviews and eventually became a cult classic. There are numerous changes in both the plot of the film and the plot of the book, though the film was generally well received. Felicity Dahl said that, \\"I think Roald would have been delighted with what they did with James.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review, praising the animated part, but calling the live-action segments \\"crude.\\" The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (by Randy Newman). It won Best Animated Feature Film at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. In August 2016, Sam Mendes was revealed to be in negotiations with Disney to direct another live action adaptation of the novel, with Nick Hornby in talks for the script. In May 2017, however, Mendes was no longer attached to the project due to his entering talks with Disney about directing a live-action film adaptation of Pinocchio. Musical adaptation The book was made into a musical with music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and book by Timothy Allen McDonald. The musical had its premiere at Goodspeed Musicals on October 21, 2010 and is currently produced in regional and youth theatre.

Life Uffa Fox was born on the Isle of Wight and was raised in East Cowes.Uffa Fox biography, Uffa Fox official website He lived for a while in Puckaster on the Isle of Wight. Work Grave of Uffa Fox, Whippingham, Isle of Wight, showing lifeboat of his design on parachute He was responsible for many of the developments which have contributed to the modern popularity of dinghy sailing. He first introduced the technique of planing to dinghy racing, and was influential in the introduction of trapezing. In about 1943 he designed a 27 ft lifeboat to be dropped from Vickers Warwick aircraft when rescuing downed aircrew or mariners; its deficiencies led to the more sturdy American A-1 lifeboat. An example of this craft and of others built and/or designed by Fox are in the collections of the Classic Boat Museum at East Cowes, Isle of Wight. These boats could be released from under the aeroplane retarded by six 32 ft diameter parachutes. Although initially adapted for the Warwick, the lifeboat was subsequently also carried by Air-Sea Rescue Lancasters and B-17 Flying Fortresses. The museum also holds a large collection of photographs by and about Fox. He became a friend of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 1949 and they raced together at Cowes Week on many occasions. They raced on Fox's Dragon \\"Fresh Breeze\\" or the Duke's 'Royal' Dragon \\"Bluebottle\\". He also took the Royal children sailing at Cowes. Apart from having a highly successful racing, cruising and sailing career, he ran successful boat design and boatbuilding businesses in the south of England. He designed many of the significant classes of boats around today, including the planing International 14, the Foxcub and Super Foxcub, the Flying Fifteen, the Flying Ten, the National 12, the National 18, the Albacore, the Firefly, the Javelin, the Pegasus Dinghy, the Jollyboat and the Day Sailer. Many of his designs exploited the wartime developments of moulded plywood, extruded aluminium, Tufnol etc.. In addition to dinghies he designed several keel boats all loosely based on the same concept as the flying fifteen, with separate fin keel and rudder. They were very light weight compared with other boats of the era. Huff of Arklow for Douglas Heard was 30'-0\\" on the waterline and Flying Fox for Fred Brownlee was 35'-0\\" waterline length. Uffa Fox designed the Britannia rowboat, used by John Fairfax for the first solo-rowing expedition across the Atlantic Ocean in 1969. The Britannia was described as \\"the Rolls- Royce of rowboats, made of mahogany.\\" It was self-righting, self-bailing and partly covered. He also designed Britannia II, used by Fairfax and Sylvia Cook to row across the Pacific Ocean in 1971 through 1972. His character is perhaps best indicated by an escapade whereby he led a group of Sea Scouts, without their parents' consent (they thought it was a weekend sailing camp), across the English Channel and up the Seine to within a few kilometres of Paris in a 25 ft open boat. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in January 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Colston Hall in Bristol. He was also among the crew of the Typhoon, an account of which was written and published by William Washburn Nutting in In the Track of Typhoon (1922). Fox joined the crew in England for her transatlantic return via France, Spain, and the Azores into New York City. Fox is said to have been the instigator in the 1950s of the \\"quintessentially English\\" annual cricket match on Bramble Bank in the central Solent.

It is bordered by Lake Avenue to the east, Forest Avenue to the south, Richmond Terrace to the north, and Holland Avenue to the west. The northwestern section of Mariners Harbor is often known as Arlington. Welcome To Mariners Harbor History The neighborhood is named for its 19th-century harvesting of oysters and other seafood products from the Kill Van Kull, which forms the neighborhood's northern border (Elm Park and Port Ivory lie to the east and west, respectively, while Graniteville is to the south). Later developments included shipbuilding, repair and marine salvage work. Fishing activity declined due to pollution during the 20th century. The Mariners Harbor Yacht Club remains as a reminder of the community's maritime past. Erastina was the first rail station built here in 1886Rides and Rambles on Staten Island 1889 and named for Erastus Wiman, the promoter who helped the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to enter New York via Staten Island. Vacant land nearby was used for staging Buffalo Bill’s “Wild West Show”, generating over 10,000 additional passengers from the St. George Ferry Terminal over the new rail line. Erastina became Mariners Harbor soon after Wiman fell from public favor due to scandal and bankruptcy. There are three other stations along the North Shore branch of the Staten Island Railway at Lake Avenue, Harbor Road, and Arlington. Passenger service on this line was discontinued on March 31, 1953. An important rail customer was Arthur Dreyer & Sons Lumber and Coal Co. near Union Avenue bridge. Remnants of the site are visible today by the coal silos. The western portion of this line was rebuilt, and is now used by freight trains traveling between New Jersey and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal in Port Ivory. Eastern Mariners Harbor Houses along Union Avenue in Mariners Harbor Mariners Harbor was home to large shipping and dry dock companies in the first half of the 20th century, including Bethlehem Steel, which owned a considerable portion of land in the area with headquarters along the waterfront on Richmond Terrace across from Mersereau Avenue and Brewers Dry Dock. Bethlehem Steel built United States Navy Destroyers during World War II. Currently, two tugboat companies—K-Sea and McAllister—operate in the area as do a number of smaller dry docks, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock, and Mariners Harbor Cargo Terminal. The John McAllister tug boat was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The West Shore Little League and Public School 44 also are part of the neighborhood. The former Cross Paper Plant sits on the edge of the area and now is used as rental space for other small business. In recent years a large amount of shopping has been built up in stretch of Forest Avenue from Lake Avenue to South Avenue, revitalizing the area and bringing new traffic concerns.

Section of the Staten Island Ship Building Company's Plant Demographics St Michael's Catholic Church The area originally populated by the Dutch and French Huguenot settlers of 17th and 18th centuries bears the famous names of those families, which include: Van Name Avenue, Van Pelt Avenue, Brabrant Street, Lockman Avenue and Mersereau Avenue. The oldest church in the neighborhood is the Summerfield Methodist Church, founded in 1840. It still stands on Harbor Road and has an active multicultural congregation, reflecting the demographics of the neighborhood. On the corner of Richmond Terrace and Lockman Avenue is the Fellowship Baptist Church, which was founded by community leader Rev. Arthur D. Phillips. The church has a large black congregation and has gained considerable political influence, being visited by New York City mayors David Dinkins, Rudolph Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg on multiple occasions during their terms of office. Other churches in the area include the Seventh Day Adventist Church and St. Clement- St.Michael's Roman Catholic Church. From the early 1900s to the 1930s, the area became home to many Italian-Americans, who still comprise a significant percentage of its population. The neighborhood was permanently transformed, however, in 1954, when the New York City Housing Authority opened the 605-unit Mariners Harbor Houses public housing project in the heart of the community,. The portion of the neighborhood west of Harbor Road (both north and south of the railroad tracks) eventually became predominantly Black. The area east of Harbor Road remained White longer, but has gradually become more Hispanic. All sections of the neighborhood have a substantial representation of Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites, with the southern portion of the neighborhood having a small Asian population. (Census Tract 231 has a 13% Asian population, a 442% increase from 2000, which was the fastest growth rate in the Asian population of any tract on Staten Island.) The northwest portion of Staten Island (which includes Mariners Harbor) as well as the Far South Shore are the fastest growing areas of Staten Island.

Thus, he was Nauru's third head of state since its independence in 1968. In terms of Nauru's emerging post-Independence political culture, the shortness of Harris's first term of Presidential office anticipated the very frequent changes of President to which Nauruans were to become accustomed, in contrast with the many years of Hammer DeRoburt's continuous first term of office. Second term as President of Nauru Subsequently, a period of nearly twenty years elapsed before Harris assumed the Presidency of Nauru for a second term. He was elected again, and served between 22 November 1995 and 11 November 1996. Issues and alignment Much of Lagumot Harris's active involvement in political leadership revolved around troubled issues surrounding the veteran Nauruan politician, seven-time President Bernard Dowiyogo. It may be recalled that, especially during Harris' periods of public office and political activity, Nauru's Parliamentary system did not have well-developed party organisations.

He was described by Joseph Wood Krutch as \\"perhaps the most widely read of all contemporary American nature writers\\" during his heyday. His brother, Roderick Peattie (1891–1955), was a geographer and a noted author in his own right. Some have said that Peattie’s views on race may be considered regressive, but that expressions of these views are \\"mercifully brief and hardly malicious\\".http://naturalhistorynetwork.org/journal/articles/8-donald-culross- peatties-an-almanac-for-moderns/ Early life Peattie was born in Chicago to the journalist Robert Peattie and the novelist Elia W. Peattie. He studied French poetry for two years at the University of Chicago and then transferred to – and graduated (1922) from — Harvard University, where he studied with the noted botanist Merritt Lyndon Fernald. After field work in the Southern and Mid-West United States, he worked as a botanist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1922–1924). He was then nature columnist for the Washington Star from 1924 to 1935. At some point in the late 1920s Peattie and his wife, with their four-year-old daughter and baby son, moved to Paris to \\"launch the frail bark of our careers\\". At two days in Paris the daughter died \\"of a malady unsuspected and always fatal\\". In a \\"search for sunlight\\" they re-settled in Vence in the south. Another son was born there. Later life Peattie was an advocate for protecting the Indiana Dunes. He served on the Save the Dunes Council in the late 1950s, helping to bring Illinois' Senator Paul Douglas into the fight to protect the Indiana Dunes from industrial development. Literature work Peattie's nature writings are distinguished by a poetic and philosophical cast of mind and are scientifically scrupulous. His best known works are the two books (out of a planned trilogy) on North American trees, A Natural History of Trees of Eastern and Central North America (1950) and A Natural History of Western Trees (1953), with woodcut illustrations by Paul Landacre. Peattie also produced children's and travel books, altogether totaling almost forty volumes. He also published the classic, botanical treatment on the Flora of the Indiana Dunes (1930). An example of Peattie's views that can be construed as racist is the following, from \\"An Almanac for Moderns\\": \\"Every species of ant has its racial characteristics. This one seems to me to be the negro of ants, and not alone from the circumstance that he is all black, but because he is the commonest victim of slavery, and seems especially susceptible to a submissive estate. He is easily impressed by the superior organization or the menacing tactics of his raiders and drivers, and, as I know him, he is relatively lazy or at least disorganized, random, feckless and witless when free in the bush, while for his masters he will work faithfully.\\" On the other hand, there's a strain of at least mild anti racism often discernible in Peattie's commentary. For example, in his discussion of Linnaeus, the Swedish founding father of taxonomy, Peattie describes, in 1936, how Linnaeus grew up in a small, provincial town far from the scientific capitals of Europe: \\"To the astonishment of all the wise men, he (Linnaeus) was not a product of Wittenberg, or the parks of Versailles or even of English country life, that nurse of so much delicate feeling for natural beauty. But genius so seldom grows where the highly born and the members of the eugenical societies tell us to expect it!\\" (This is a slap against the American Eugenics Society, a national group formed in 1921, which was prominent in the 1930s, promoting \\"racial betterment.\\" During that time, the group consisted of \\"mostly prominent and wealthy members who more often than not were non- scientists.\\" library.missouri.edu/exhibits/eugenics/aes.htm) Furthermore, according to Peattie's grandson, David Peattie, \\"In the period following the bombing of Pearl Harbor... [Donald Culross Peattie] spoke out eloquently against the internment of Japanese Americans, and wrote letters to the editor in their defense\\" http://tupress.org/blog/david-peattie-on-his-grandfather- donald-culross-peattie. That was after he witnessed a Japanese gardener, who had been hired by the owner of a house he was renting in California, interred in the camps. Thus, Peattie's belief in the inferiority of people of African descent seems to be specific to them, and does not seem to have extended to other non-white people, or implied a broader support of eugenics.

The barrow is crowned by a stone containing the fragmented Uppland Runic Inscription 13. This runestone, crowns the barrow of Björn Ironside in Uppland, Sweden. The stone is a fragment; broken pieces of the stone bear false witnesses next to it. Björn Ironside (Old Norse: Bjǫrn Járnsíða; Icelandic: Björn Járnsíða; Swedish: Björn Järnsida; Danish: Bjørn Jernside; Medieval Latin: Bier Costae ferreae) was a Norse Viking chief and legendary king of Sweden. According to the 12th- and 13th-century Scandinavian histories, he was the son of the notorious and historically dubious Viking king Ragnar Lodbrok. He lived in the 9th century, being securely dated between 855 and 858.Chronicon Fontanellense, Anno 855, 856 ; Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 856, 858 Björn Ironside is said to have been the first ruler of the Swedish Munsö dynasty. In the early 18th century, a barrow on the island of Munsö was claimed by antiquarians to be Björn Järnsidas hög or Björn Ironside's barrow.Lagerquist 1997:24Carl Bernadotte et al. (1956), Sveriges hundra konungar. Stockholm: Biblioteksböcker, p. 81. This work dates Björn's reign in Sweden in c. 785-800 on the assumption that an early Swedish king was mixed up with a later Viking chief. Medieval sources refer to Björn Ironside's sons and grandsons, including Erik Björnsson and Björn at Haugi.The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise, p. 60 His descendants in the male line supposedly ruled over the Swedes until c. 1060. Björn in Frankish sources \\"Berno\\" was a powerful Viking chieftain and naval commander. He appears in contemporary sources such as Annales Bertiniani and the Chronicon Fontanellense. He is first mentioned in the summer of 855. The oldest text that details his origins is the Norman history of William of Jumièges (c. 1070). According to William, the Danes had a custom of requiring the younger sons of kings to leave the kingdom, to reinforce the king's authority; thus, after Ragnar Lodbrok became king, he ordered Björn to leave his realm. Björn left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in West Francia.Guillaume de Jumièges, Histoire des ducs de Normandie, p. 11-3 The contemporary annals show that he cooperated with another Viking called Sigtrygg and sailed up the Seine in 855, from which his and Sigtrygg's forces raided the inland. Their combined forces were beaten in Champagne by Charles the Bald of West Francia in the same year, but not decisively. Sigtrygg withdrew in the next year, but Björn received reinforcement from another Viking army and could not be expelled from the Seine area. He and his men took up winter quarters at the so-called Givold's Grave, which served as base for an assault against Paris, which was plundered around the new year 856–857.Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 856, 857 Björn constructed a fortification on the island Oissel above Rouen which he kept as his stronghold for years. He certainly swore fealty to Charles the Bald in Verberie in 858 but it is not clear if he kept his pledge. King Charles eventually resolved to meet the unruly Seine Vikings with all his available forces and besieged Oissel in July. The siege failed badly, for the pirates defended the fortification with vigour.Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 858 Moreover, Charles's brother Louis the German of East Francia invaded his lands and many vassals fell from him.Die Jahrbücher von Fulda, Anno 858 , p. 29. Thus the siege was broken off in September.Gustav Storm (1877), Historisk Tidskrift II:1, p. 407 After Björn's meeting with Charles in Verberie we don't find his name in contemporary sources. However, the Viking warriors in the Seine continued their raids during the following years and even plundered Paris again in 861. In his despair Charles the Bald tried to use another Viking chief, Veland, whose men operated in the Somme region, to attack the Seine Vikings at Oissel. However, this scheme backfired since the two Viking armies made a deal and united their forces.Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 861 The Norsemen were encamped by the lower Seine in 861–862, but then split again. Veland agreed to become a Christian and joined royal service, while the Seine Vikings went to sea. Some of them joined the fighting between the ruler of Bretagne and some Frankish counts.Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 862 Expedition to the Mediterranean A number of Frankish, Norman, Arab, Scandinavian and Irish sources mention a large Viking raid into the Mediterranean in 859–861, co-led by Hastein, Björn Ironside and possibly one or more of his brothers. After raiding down the Iberian coast and fighting their way through Gibraltar, the Norsemen pillaged the south of France, where the fleet stayed over winter, before landing in Italy where they captured the city of Pisa.Annales de Saint Bertin, Anno 859, 860 Flush with this victory and others around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and North Africa) during the Mediterranean expedition, the Vikings are recorded to have lost 40 ships to a storm. They returned to the Straits of Gibraltar and, at the coast of Medina-Sidonia, lost 2 ships to fire catapults in a surprise raid by Andalusian forces, leaving only 20 ships intact. The remnants of the fleet came back to French waters in 862. Björn Ironside was the leader of the expedition according to the later chronicle of William of Jumièges. The early 11th century Fragmentary Annals of Ireland say that two sons of Ragnall mac Albdan, a chief who had been expelled from Lochlann by his brothers and stayed in the Orkney Islands, headed the enterprise.Gustav Storm (1877), Historisk Tidskrift II:1, p. 420 William of Jumièges refers to Björn as Bier Costae ferreae (Ironside) who was Lotbroci regis filio (son of King Lodbrok).Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria, by Rory McTurk (University of Leeds) William's account of the Mediterranean expedition centers around Björn's foster-father Hastein. The two Vikings conducted many (mostly successful) raids in France. Later on Hastein got the idea to make Björn the new Roman Emperor and led a large Viking raid into the Mediterranean together with his protegée. They proceeded inland to the town of Luni, which they believed to be Rome at the time, but were unable to breach the town walls. To gain entry a tricky plan was devised: Hastein sent messengers to the bishop to say that, being deathly ill, he had a deathbed conversion and wished to receive Christian sacraments and/or to be buried on consecrated ground within their church. He was brought into the chapel with a small honor guard, then surprised the dismayed clerics by leaping from his stretcher. The Viking party then hacked its way to the town gates, which were promptly opened letting the rest of the army in. When they realised that Luni was not Rome, Björn and Hastein wished to investigate this city but changed their minds when they heard that the Romans were well prepared for defense. After returning to West Europe, the two men parted company. Björn was shipwrecked at the English coast and barely survived. He then went to Frisia where William says he died.Guillaume de Jumièges, Histoire des ducs de Normandie, p. 20 There are some historical challenges with this account. Hastein appears in the contemporary sources later than Björn, and in order to be his foster-father would have been around his 80s when he died. That is not impossible, citing the fact that their contemporaries, the Viking Rollo and King Harald Fairhair of Norway lived comparable lifespans. Luni is also known to have been plundered by Saracens.Gustav Storm (1877), Historisk Tidskrift II:1 The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok and Tale of Ragnar's Sons The story of Björn and his brothers, the sons of the Scandinavian king Ragnar Lodbrok, was retold in different versions throughout the Middle Ages. The Tale of Ragnar's Sons (Ragnarssona þáttr) is an Icelandic Fornaldar Saga from about the 14th century that combines traditional Norse oral history with legendary themes. It states that Björn was the son of Ragnar and AslaugPeter August Gödecke in Sagan om Ragnar Lodbrok och hans söner Norstedts Stockholm 1880 p. 24 and that his brothers were Hvitserk, Ivar the Boneless, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The tale also tells of Björn's half-brothers Eric and Agnar. The saga portrays Ragnar as the overlord of large parts of Sweden and possibly even Denmark. While he was still alive, Björn and his brothers left Sweden to conquer Zealand, Reidgotaland (here Jutland), Gotland, Öland and all the minor islands. They then settled at Lejre in Zealand, Denmark with Ivar the Boneless as their leader. Ragnar's sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake Mälaren and sent a message to the Swedish King Eysteinn, a vassal of Ragnar, that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar's sons. Moreover, Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn's daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner. Eysteinn offered Eric as much of Uppsala öd as he wanted, and Borghild, in wergild for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted. In Zealand, Björn, Aslaug and Hvitserk, who had been playing tafl, became upset and sailed to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug rode with cavalry across the land. In a great battle they killed Eysteinn. According to the saga, their father Ragnar was captured and killed by King Ælla in England after a foolhardy invasion attempt. Björn and his brothers, seeking revenge, attacked Ælla but were beaten back. As Ivar realised that the English king could not be defeated right away, he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox's hide and swore never to wage war against Ælla. Then Ivar cut the ox's hide into such fine strands that he could envelop a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. Ivar made himself popular in England and asked his brothers to attack again. During the battle Ivar sided with his brothers and so did many of the English chieftains with their people, in loyalty to Ivar. Ælla was taken captive and in revenge they carved the blood eagle on him. Later Björn and his brothers pillaged in England, Normandy, France, and Lombardy, until they came to the town Luna in Italy. When they came back to Scandinavia, they divided the kingdom so that Björn Ironside took Uppsala and Sweden.The Tale of Ragnar's Sons Other sources The partly legendary Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum (c. 1200), is the first text to mention Björn Ironside as a King of Sweden. According to Saxo, Ragnar Lodbrok had a quarrel with the recently elevated ruler of the Swedes, Sörle. He therefore invaded the Swedish lands in company with his sons Björn, Fridleif and Radbard. Before battle had broken out, the opposing sides agreed to settle the matter through a combat. Ragnar and his three sons met the renowned champion Starkad and his seven sons in the sight of the two armies. \\"Björn, having inflicted great slaughter on the foe without hurt to himself, gained from the strength of his sides, which were like iron, a perpetual name [i.e., Ironside]\\". Ragnar and his sons slew their eight opponents, after which their troops fell on Sörle and his army and annihilated them. Ragnar then \\"presented Björn with the lordship of Sweden for his conspicuous bravery and service.\\" Later on, another son of Ragnar, Ubbe, colluded with his maternal grandfather Esbjörn and conspired against Ragnar. Esbjörn sent envoys to Björn in Sweden to drum up support for a rebellion, but Björn refused to listen. Instead, he hanged the envoys while their party were slaughtered by the Swedes. Shortly afterwards Esbjörn was slain in a sea battle, and Ubbe was captured after a heroic resistance. In due time Ragnar appointed Björn regent of Norway, while Sweden was handed over to another son, Eric Weatherhat. After the death of Ragnar, Björn and his brothers attacked Ella in England with 400 ships and killed him. He then went back to his Swedish kingdom, but intervened in Denmark when the Danes rose against the rule of Ragnar's sons. With a fleet of 1,700 ships, he and his brothers crushed the insurgents at Slesvig. This is the last we hear about Björn Ironside in the Gesta Danorum.Saxo Grammaticus, The Danish History, Book IX The Hervarar saga from the 13th century tells that Eysteinn Beli was killed by Björn and his brothers as told in Ragnar Lodbrok's saga, and they conquered all of Sweden. When Ragnar died Björn Ironside inherited Sweden. He had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson, who became the next king of Sweden. According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Björn had a son named Asleik (Aslak), who was the ancestor of Thorfinn Karlsefni. Anglo-Saxon and Irish sources suggest that the Danish invasion of England after 865 was led by three brothers called Ingvar (i.e. Ivar), Ubbe and Halfdan who, judging from the Irish Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib, were sons of a Ragnall (Ragnar or a similar name).Alfred P. Smyth (1977), Scandinavian kings in the British Isles. Oxford. Björn is not mentioned in this context, but later Norman tradition suggests that he may have been a brother. According to William of Jumièges he died in Frisia, which also had an association with the invaders of England. Ubbe is sometimes labeled the \\"Frisian Jarl\\" and the invaders are occasionally called Scaldingi (men from Schelde). The kingships of Björn is at times historically problematic since it is not supported by older sources and presents insurmountable chronological inconsistencies.Gustav Storm (1877), Historisk Tidskrift II:1. p. 426, 477-8 In fiction A principal character in the television series Vikings, played as a young boy by Nathan O'Toole and through adulthood by Alexander Ludwig, is loosely based on the historical character and portrayed as the son of Lagertha, rather than of Aslaug. According to the lore, Björn is not the eldest son, while in the show he is the eldest of all the sons of Ragnar. In the novel Monster by Michael Grant, one character, Armo, mentions that he's descended from \\"Björn Ironside, a very badass Viking\\".

In the 18th century poverty and malnutrition were widespread across the peninsula, with High Halstow no exception; adult life expectancy was then about 30 years, lessened by ague, or marsh fever, the names for malaria, which proliferated in the North Kent Marshes and waterlogged farmland, a stronghold of the mosquito. The cause of malaria was discovered in 1890, and within five years the number of people falling ill with the disease decreased sharply as farmland and marshes were drained. This task was performed in no small way by Henry Pye, after he moved to the area. The village remained small until after the Second World War, comprising the church, a school, two shops, a pub, a wheelwright's shop, and an undertaker's, with the village being served by a single policeman. Eventually some of the older houses were demolished and replaced. Churchill Place was developed and in the area behind the church, formerly known as the Square, several modern bungalows replaced five thatched cottages. From 1952 more homes were built in the village to house Isle of Grain oil refinery employees. Historically, the main economic activity around High Halstow has been farming, but some of the village's residents gained employment outside the village, at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps and at the Medway Oil and Storage Co at Grain. Chatham Dockyard and the Short Brothers seaplane works at Rochester were also traditional employers for the whole area until they shut many years ago. In 1956 a new school opened, the old school building being demolished along with Hill Farm to make way for additional housing. Building development has continued intermittently, including the new estates of Northwood Park and Heron Fields, development of which began in 1998. The Red Dog, High Halstow The village still has its church, a shop and pub (the Red Dog) but has changed beyond recognition in living memory. The village's cricket club has played in the area for almost 120 years. Ever expanding, the club now has Three Saturday sides, one Sunday side and three colts sides. They play their home matches at Rayner's Meadow, which is situated in Christmas Lane, and at the Hundred of Hoo school, Hoo. North Kent Marsh Northward Hill RSPB Reserve Northward Hill RSPB Reserve lies to the north of the village, between High Halstow and Cooling. It comprises of grazing marsh, woodland and farmland. The woodland forms High Halstow Nature Reserve (a local SSSI). Here is the largest heronry in Britain, where some 150–200 pairs nest. A heronry has been in the woods from at least 1947, when it was mentioned in a book on the Hundred of Hoo by Ralph Arnold. Many other birds, such as little egrets, avocets and marsh harriers, can also be seen in the reserve. This site was scheduled for demolition under government proposals for an international London airport in connection with the Thames Gateway. Northward Hill, was known once locally as \\"the Norrards\\". Beyond it on the marsh is a disused experimental radar station, now part of the reserve. Buck Hole Farmhouse Buck Hole Farmhouse stands next to Northward Hill Reserve; it and another Grade II listed farmhouse Great Dalham date from the early 18th century.

He is best known for discovering photosynthesis by showing that light is essential to the process by which green plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.Beale and Beale, Echoes of Ingen Housz, 2011Geerd Magiels, Dr. Jan Ingenhousz, or why don't we know who discovered photosynthesis, 1st Conference of the European Philosophy of Science Association 2007 He also discovered that plants, like animals, have cellular respiration. In his lifetime he was known for successfully inoculating the members of the Habsburg family in Vienna against smallpox in 1768 and subsequently being the private counsellor and personal physician to the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa.  Early life  He was born into the patrician Ingen Housz family in Breda in Staats-Brabant in the Dutch Republic. From the age of 16, Ingenhousz studied medicine at the University of Leuven, where he obtained his MD in 1753. He studied two more years at the University of Leiden, where he attended lectures by, among others, Pieter van Musschenbroek, which led Ingenhousz to have a lifelong interest in electricity. In 1755 he returned home to Breda, where he started a general medical practice.  Work with smallpox  Following his father's death in July 1764, Ingenhousz intended to travel through Europe for study, starting in England where he wanted to learn the latest techniques in inoculation against smallpox. Via the physician John Pringle, who had been a family friend since the 1740s, he quickly made many valuable contacts in London, and in due time became a master inoculator. In 1767, he inoculated 700 village people in a successful effort to combat an epidemic in Hertfordshire. In 1768, Empress Maria Theresa read a letter by Pringle on the success in the fight against smallpox in England, whereas in the Austrian empire the medical establishment vehemently opposed inoculations. She decided to have her own family inoculated first (a cousin had already died), and requested help via the English royal house. On Pringle's recommendation, Ingenhousz was selected and requested to travel to Austria. He had planned to inoculate the Royal Family by pricking them with a needle and thread that were coated with smallpox germs taken from the pus of a smallpox-infected person. The idea of the inoculation was that by giving a few germs to a healthy body the body would develop immunisation from smallpox. The inoculation was a success and he became Maria Theresa's court physician. He settled in Vienna, where in 1775 he married Agatha Maria Jacquin.  Work with photosynthesis  In the 1770s Ingenhousz became interested in gaseous exchanges of plants. He did this after meeting the scientist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) at his house in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 23 May 1771. Priestley had found out that plants make and absorb gases. Ingenhousz' travelling party in northern England included Benjamin Franklin. They then stayed at the rectory in Thornhill, Yorkshire with the polymath and botanist Rev. John Michell. In 1779, Ingenhousz discovered that, in the presence of light, plants give off bubbles from their green parts while, in the shade, the bubbles eventually stop.Jan Ingenhousz, Experiments upon Vegetables, Discovering Their great Power of purifying the Common Air in the Sun-shine, and of Injuring it in the Shade and at Night. To Which is Joined, A new Method of examining the accurate Degree of Salubrity of the Atmosphere, London, 1779. From Henry Marshall Leicester and Herbert S. Klickstein, A Source Book in Chemistry 1400–1900, New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 1952. Excerpts. Retrieved 24 June 2008. He identified the gas as oxygen. He also discovered that, in the dark, plants give off carbon dioxide. He realised as well that the amount of oxygen given off in the light is more than the amount of carbon dioxide given off in the dark. This demonstrated that some of the mass of plants comes from the air, and not only the water and nutrients in the soil.  Other work  Blue plaque, Church Street, Calne In addition to his work in the Netherlands and Vienna, Ingenhousz spent time in France, England, Scotland, and Switzerland, among other places. He carried out research in electricity, heat conduction, and chemistry, and was in close and frequent correspondence with both Benjamin Franklin and Henry Cavendish. In 1785, he described the irregular movement of coal dust on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as Brownian motion. Ingenhousz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1769. In 1799, Ingenhousz died at Bowood House, Calne, England, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Calne. His wife died the following year.*  Tribute  On 8 December 2017, Google Doodle commemorated his 287th birthday.  References   Further reading  * Norman and Elaine Beale, Echoes of Ingen Housz.

History  Raised in Norrland from smaller units of 500 men called fänikor, more specifically from the provinces of Västerbotten, Ångermanland, Medelpad, Hälsingland and Gästrikland, in 1615 and counting 3,000 men. In 1617, the regiment was led by Svante Banér and consisted of seven fänikor. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (fältregementen), thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name. One of the field regiments was used in 1621 in the war against Poland and was present at the siege of Riga between 10 August and 13 September with eight companies of 150 men each. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the period to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment.

He is called Uppsale because he stayed at Old Upsala, the era's religious centre. He and Björn are sometimes identified with similarly-named kings mentioned in Rimbert's Vita Ansgari and by Adam of Bremen.Adam av Bremen (1984) Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius, p. 60 (Book I, Chapter 61). Norse tradition The Hervarar saga recounts that Anund and his brother Björn succeeded king Erik Refilsson, their cousin. This happened about two generations before the reign of Harald Fairhair of Norway (c. 872-930). The two brothers shared the realm, so that Anund resided in Uppsala while Björn made his residence at Haugi (\\"the Barrow\\"). His son Erik succeeded him on the Swedish throne. A Norwegian document from the early 14th century provides a few additional details. A certain Herjulf Horn-breaker was the standard-bearer of King Halfdan the Black of Vestfold in Norway, the father of Harald Fairhair. However, Herjulf fell out with his lord and escaped to Sweden where he was well received by King Anund. After a while he evoked the wrath of his new master as well, since he slept with Anund's kinswoman Helga. Once again, he was forced to flee, bringing Helga with him. The couple eventually settled in the then uninhabited Härjedalen. The document enumerates their descendants for 15 generations. This account is at least partly a construction, since Herjulf Horn-breaker is otherwise known as a pioneer settler in Iceland.Eriksson, Nils-Erik (2003) \\"Härjulf Hornbrytaren – dokumentet och sägnen\\", Seminarium om Slyos The Vita Ansgari The Vita Ansgari from c. 870 relates that a Swedish king called Anund was driven away from his country. The reason is unknown, but might have to do with rivalry between royal kinsmen. However, the Vita does not say how Anund was related to the other kings mentioned in the text (Erik, Björn, Olof). Anund stayed in exile in Denmark but was keen to regain his kingdom. He therefore approached the Danes and promised them the spoils of plunder from the important commercial center Birka. The Danish king at the time was Horik I who had spent time in exile in Sweden in c. 812-813 and therefore might have had a special relationship with members of the Swedish royal clan. Sometime in the 840s, Anund thus invaded Sweden with a large Danish host of 21 longships and 11 of his own, unexpectedly approaching Birka. At the time, the Swedish king (Björn at Haugi?) was far away, and the chiefs and popular levies had no time to gather. Only the Christian chief of the port, Hergeir, was there together with the merchants and townsmen. They sought refuge in the nearby fortification. Being too few to defend themselves successfully, the inhabitants sent envoys to Anund and offered their friendship and alliance. Anund demanded one hundred marks of silver, which was granted. The Danes felt tricked, since \\"every merchant owned more than they had been offered\\" and wanted to make a surprise attack on Birka in order to burn and plunder it. According to the Vita, Hergeir made the townsfolk turn away from the pagan gods and make promises to Christ the Lord in order to be saved. In the meanwhile Anund tried to avert the self-willed plans of his Viking allies. He asked them to draw lots about whether it was the will of the Aesir that Birka should be destroyed, meaning that they were probably casting runes. The outcome was that there was no possibility to carry out the plan with any success, so that an attempt on Birka would bring bad luck to the Danes. They then asked where to go for plunder and the answer was to go to a certain Slavic town. The Danes accordingly left Birka, sailed over to the other town and seized it in a surprise attack. They then returned to Denmark with rich booty. As for Anund, he made peace with the Swedes and returned the ransom money to the townspeople. He then stayed in Sweden for some time since he sought reconciliation with his people.

Later in his career Tainter was associated with the International Graphopone Company of West Virginia, and also managed his own research and development laboratory, earning him the title: 'Father Of The Talking Machine' (i.e.: father of the phonograph). Biography Tainter was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, where he attended public school. His education was modest, acquiring his knowledge mostly through self-education. In 1873, he took a job with the Alvan Clark and Sons Company producing telescopes in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which then came under contract with the U.S. Navy to conduct observations of the transit of Venus on December 8, 1874, resulting in Tainter being sent with one of its observation expeditions to New Zealand. In 1878 he opened his own shop for the production of scientific instruments in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, where he made the acquaintance of Alexander Graham Bell. A year later Bell called Tainter to what would become his Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he would work for the next several years. During this time, Tainter worked with the Bells on several inventions, amongst them the photophone and phonograph, which they developed into the Graphophone, a substantial improvement of Edison's earlier device, for which Tainter received several patents along with the Bells. Edison subsequently sued the Volta Graphophone Company (of which Tainter was part owner) for patent infringement, but the case was settled by a compromise between the two. Tainter in 1919 In 1886, he married Lila R. Munro, and over the next years worked in Washington, perfecting his graphophone and founding a company trying to market the Graphophone as a dictation machine: the first Dictaphone. In 1887 Tainter invented the helically wound paper tube as an improved graphophone cylinder. This design was light and strong, and came to be widely used in applications far removed from its original intent, such as mailing tubes and product containers. In 1888 he was stricken with severe pneumonia, which would incapacitate him intermittently for the rest of his life, leading him and his wife to move to San Diego, California in 1903. After the death of his first wife in 1924, he married Laura F. Onderdonk in 1928. Tainter received several distinguished awards for his graphophone. Unpublished work In 1947 Tainter's widow, Laura Fontaine Onderdonk, donated a number of Sumner Tainter's unpublished writings, including the surviving Home Notebooks, to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. The Home Notebooks contain daily agendas describing in detail the project work Tainter conducted at the Volta Laboratory during the 1880s. In 1950 Laura Tainter donated other historical items, including Sumner Tainter's manuscripts of \\"Memoirs of Charles Sumner Tainter\\", the first 71 pages of which detailed his experiences up to 1887, plus further writings on his work at the Graphophone factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

He had an ambivalent attitude to Christianity, and was known as a successful warrior king in the Baltic region. Olof is not mentioned in the Icelandic sagas of the 12th and 13th century, which give a different line of succession of supposed Viking Age Swedish rulers, but the Vita Ansgari, the near-contemporary writings of Ansgar's companion Rimbert, and the 10th-century account of Adam of Bremen both mention him and are generally seen as more reliable than the sagas.Olof is also mentioned by Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), who drew from the Vita Ansgari but might also have heard the name from the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen; see Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius, p. 60 (Book I, Chapter 61). Religious dispositions Ansgar had undertaken missionary work among the Swedes in 829-831, and laid the foundations to a fragile congregation based in the important merchant town Birka. By the early 850s Ansgar, who was now Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, began to worry about the future of the community which was without a priest. He received the consent of the East Frankish ruler Louis the German to go to Sweden in person and received a personal letter to the Swedish king Olof.Vita Ansgari, Chapter 25 When he came to Denmark, King Horik I provided him with an envoy and a message which asked Olof to allow Ansgar to missionise freely. Ansgar's biographer Rimbert, in his Vita Ansgari (Life of Ansgar) relates that the Archbishop arrived to Birka after having sailed for 20 days. The year is not certain but seems to have been 851 or 852.Ansgar (1986) Boken om Ansgar. Stockholm: Proprius, p. 103, 228. There he found that King Olof and a large part of the people were affected by a pagan counter-movement. A seer asserted that he had participated in the council of the Aesir who had expressed their dissatisfaction with the Christian god. In case the current gods were not sufficient to the people, the gods decided to accept the former King Eric (Erik Björnsson, or Erik Refilsson?) in their abode. The seer's vision was widely believed, a sanctuary was built in the honour of the long-deceased Eric, and people performed sacrifices to him.Vita Ansgari, Chapter 26 Having installed himself in Birka, Ansgar invited King Olof to his place and feted him with a meal and gifts. The king announced that he would be glad to assist Ansgar, but dared not undertake anything before he had searched the will of the people, and divination had been carried out. \\"It is, namely, common among them, that every public issue is decided more through the unanimous will of the people, than through royal exertion of power.\\"Vita Ansgari, Chapter 26 Some time later a thing was held in Birka, where a herold announced Ansgar's request to missionise among the Swedes. After due deliberation, the thing agreed to allow Christian priests and holy sacraments among them. A second thing, which was held at a different place in the realm, confirmed what had been said. The king summoned Ansgar and enjoined the construction of churches, providing the Archbishop with a piece of land in Birka for a chapel.Vita Ansgari, Chapter 27 Viking expedition to Courland The Curonians in Latvia had once been under the Swedish realm. However, they had rebelled against the Swedes a long time ago and refused to pay them tribute. The Danes, being aware of this, saw the opportunity to take over the Swedish dominions in Courland. At the time of Ansgar's second visit to Birka, They marshalled a great fleet and sailed to Courland in order to take over their goods and to make the Curonians pay tribute to the Danes instead. The Curonians gathered forces from all five of their towns and butchered half the Danish army, after which they plundered the Danish ships, gaining a great deal of gold, silver, and other valuables. When the Swedes and King Olof heard of the Danish failure, they decided to win the reputation that the Swedes could do what the Danes could not and to make the Curonians pay tribute again. Consequently, the Swedes gathered an enormous army and attacked Curland. The first town they attacked was called Seeburg. It had 7,000 armed men, but the town was pillaged, ravaged, and burnt by the Swedes. The Swedes left their ships at the coast and started out on a five-day expedition into the hinterland. They reached the town of Apulia (probably modern Apuole). The town had as many as 15,000 armed men. The Swedes stormed the town but it was ferociously defended, and after eight days of battle many men had fallen without result. By the ninth day, the Swedes were weary of the battle and discussed whether to pursue it. They decided to cast lots with runes, but without results. Rimbert then relates that some of the Swedes had heard of the Christian faith and they decided to cast lots asking the Christian god about how to proceed. They interpreted the results as full support from the Christian god and decided to attack the town once again. When the Curonians saw that the Swedes were about to resume their attack, they gave up and offered to the Swedes all the gold, silver, and weapons that they had taken from the Danes the previous year. They also offered to pay half a pound of silver for every man in the town and to resume paying tribute to the Swedes and to give hostages as a warrant for paying. They declared that they wished to be the subjects of the Swedish kings as in former times. King Olof granted their request, and the Swedes returned home with treasures beyond count and thirty hostages as a security for the Curonians' future loyalty.Vita Ansgari, Chapter 30 The information in the Vita has been tentatively combined with archaeological findings in Latvia. According to the archaeologist Birger Nerman these indicate Swedish presence in the region in c. 650-800. Moreover, Nerman discovered arrows and other traces of a 9th century battle in Apuole, while Seeburg was identified with Grobiņa at the coast which has graves which indicate connections with Gotland and the Mälaren Valley.Nerman, Birger (1945) När Sverige kristnades. Skoglunds. There are nevertheless other interpretations of the place names mentioned in the Vita; Apulia might be Pilten at Ventspils which was also known as Ampule, while Seeburg could be Seleburg at the Daugava River.Ansgar (1986) Boken om Ansgar.

The game focuses upon a group of warriors who join together to earn their fame and fortune in the darkest depths of the Old World. Games Workshop stopped producing Warhammer Quest in 1998. Game Mainly written by Andy Jones, Warhammer Quest utilizes a set of simple game mechanics to simulate the Warriors' actions as they explore and fight through the dungeons of the Old World. The game puts a strong emphasis on co-operative and thoughtful play by the players in order to survive against the myriad monsters they inevitably face. Primarily designed for four players, the original game continues the tradition of HeroQuest by supplying a Barbarian, Wizard, Dwarf, and Elf as its main Warriors. The game components are * a 4-page introductory booklet * a 32-page rule book * 10 plastic dungeon doorways * a 192-page role-playing book * a 16-page adventure book * 56 plastic bases * 91 plastic miniatures * 108 playing cards * 32 game board sections * 58 counters and tokens * 4 character cards * 50-sheet adventure record pad * 18 six-sided dice; * game box =Treasure= The game focuses on the acquisition of vast amounts of treasure, which is divided into two types: * Dungeon Room treasure is collected after every group of Dungeon Monsters are killed. * Objective Room treasure is sometimes collected once the warriors have killed all monsters within the given objective room or as a reward at the end of the Adventure. Treasure can be sold for gold, which can then be used to pay for training and advancement, as well as buying items essential to survival: healing, a weapon, extra armour, or magical talismans that evoke special abilities. =Monsters= All of the hostile creatures encountered by Warrior parties are known under the collective name of \\"Monsters\\". Almost all Warhammer creatures of the time were included in the Bestiary section of the Roleplay Book. Monsters are broadly divided into the following species: * Beastmen * Chaos (Warriors and Daemons) * Chaos Dwarves * Dark Elves * Monsters (creatures with no specific affiliation e.g. Gorgons, Ogres, Dragons etc.) * Orcs and Goblins * Skaven * Undead Lizardmen are the only major race not to feature in the game. They were later released as an additional supplement in the Warhammer Quest magazine \\"Deathblow\\". The challenge of encounters is related to the current Dungeon level and the strength of the party. At lower levels, a small group of Orcs will provide a reasonable challenge; at higher levels, tougher opponents such as Ogres and Dragons are encountered. Warhammer Quest Roleplaying The game was released with a Roleplay Book, which enables players to expand their games by introducing tabletop roleplaying game mechanics. When used, the Roleplay Book offers the players the chance to travel between Settlements, train to the next level, visit numerous shops and traders, as well as visit Special Locations. The Wizard, Elf, and Dwarf have a Special Location that was exclusive to each of them and, if their luck was good and if they had enough gold, they could buy specialty items to help them in their adventures. Additionally, the Roleplay Book introduces the element of Psychology, which includes new rules for Fear, Terror, Hatred, Breaking (fleeing), and being Prone. There are also rules and descriptions for using two new Characteristics: Luck and Willpower. The Roleplay Book also contains a bestiary of Monsters that the warriors might encounter. The Roleplay Book also offers a Hazards Table (for use when traveling to a village, town or city), a Settlement Events Table (for use when spending time in a settlement), extra Treasure and Objective Room Treasure tables as well as ‘Battle-level Monster Tables’ for use as the Warriors' careers progress. The last section of the Roleplay Book contains guidelines for writing adventures and Warrior development. It also contains an entire pre-written campaign for the Gamemaster and the Warriors to play as well as introducing the first expansion Warrior of Warhammer Quest: the Dwarf Trollslayer. Warrior progression Every Warrior can be progressed up to 10 stages or ‘Battle Levels’. In many role-playing games, character advance by accumulating experience points. In Warhammer Quest a Warrior accumulates gold to advance battle-levels and can also use the gold to buy items. Every monster encountered and killed is worth a certain amount of Gold. In addition, the Warrior can sell any treasure at the end of the adventure. The leader carrying the lantern (typically the Barbarian) decides which warrior gained an item of treasure. Expansions A number of expansions were released for Warhammer Quest. These included two new adventure packs, several Warrior packs as well as additional Treasure Card packs and a set of blank Monster Cards & Event cards, where players could record their own monsters from the Warhammer world that were not written within the Roleplay book or else not produced as an official card by Games Workshop. =Adventure packs= There were two adventure packs released for the game. Lair of the Orc Lord contained six new adventures against Greenskins (Orcs & Goblins) while Catacombs of Terror featured six new adventures that pitted the Warriors against the evils of the Undead. Both expansions contained new, pewter models to represent their enemies as well as new Board tiles and cards. =Warrior packs= Games Workshop released packs for nine additional Warriors, all of which had some background within the Warhammer world. The packs consisted of a Warrior model, rulebook and a set of card tokens detailing the warrior's original statistics & equipment. The rulebooks offered a piece of background as to the warrior- type & a set of rules to use the warrior including details about any new special locations they might visit, skills or equipment they could obtain as well as details about their Battle Level progression. The Warrior Packs released were as follows: *Pit Fighter *Warrior Priest *Imperial Noble *Elf Ranger *Dwarf Trollslayer *Chaos Warrior *Wardancer *Witch Hunter *Bretonnian Knight Magazines =White Dwarf= To accompany Warhammer Quest Games Workshop produced a number of articles in their White Dwarf magazine that added additional elements to the game play such as extra rooms, adventures & other articles.

Deathblow consisted of only three issues. Deathblow included articles by contributors outside of Games Workshop's employ and featured articles from White Dwarf, the Citadel Journal and contained new adventures and a selection of other Warhammer Quest related paraphernalia. Deathblow introduced eight new Warriors: The Halfling Thief, Kislev Shaman, an Assassin, an Ogre, Druid of Albion, Dwarf Brewmaster, Salty Seadog & Lord of Aenarion. Deathblow was named after Warhammer Quest’s ‘Death-Blow’ mechanic where if a warrior killed a monster in one single strike he could then carry that attack through to an adjacent monster. Deathblow #1 * Down Town * The Bank * Eyes of Doom * Dangerous Dwarfs * Spawn of the Old Ones * Rumble in the Jungle * Claws of the Bear * Njet Comrade * You Thieving Little B*****! * You Ain't Seen Me, Right? * Wotchoo lookin' At?

Sequels Eighteen years after the game ceased production, Games Workshop released Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower (2016)https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197572/warhammer-quest-silver-tower, Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal (2017)https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218933/warhammer-quest-shadows-over- hammerhal and Warhammer Quest:Blackstone Fortress (2018)https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/264198/warhammer-quest-blackstone- fortress. These games follow the original in overall design as dungeon crawling board games, but with substantially different rulesets. Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower and Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal are set in Games Workshops new fantasy setting, Warhammer Age of Sigmar. While Warhammer Quest:Blackstone Fortress is set in Games Workshops sci-fi universe Warhammer 40,000. Other implementations On 20 August 2012 GW announced Warhammer Quest for iOS devices. The development company is Rodeo Games. It was released on 30 May 2013. It was later ported to PC, Mac and Linux by Twistplay and was released by Chilled Mouse on Steam on 7 January 2015, Android on 25 June 2015, and later to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Warhammer Quest 2 by Perchang was released on 20 October 2017 for iOShttps://www.pockettactics.com/reviews/review-warhammer-quest-2-the-end- times/ and for Android on 11 April 2018.https://www.androidauthority.com/warhammer-quest-2-850894/ Reception In the January 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 225), Rick Swan liked the high quality of the game components, and the \\"easy-on-the-brain explanations\\" of the rules. But Swan objected to actual object of the game, which he summed up as \\"a string of random events, most of them combat encounters, with an occasional death trap thrown in to break the monotony.\\" Swan also noted the game's complete lack of realism, but said, \\"Warhammer Quest doesn’t pretend to be realistic, and therefore doesn’t deserve to be criticized for its lack of logic. That’s like criticizing a candy bar for its lack of vitamins.\\" Swan concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6, and only recommended the game as a means of training up new role-players: \\"Warhammer Quest does a admirable job of incorporating role-playing fundamentals, and thus serves as a painless introduction to RPGs. And when Quest-ers get the hang of hit points and attribute scores, that’s where you step in with Call of Cthulhu or the AD&D; game.\\" See also *Dungeonquest *Mighty Warriors References External links * Category:Board games introduced in 1995 Category:Cooperative board games Category:Fantasy board games Category:Warhammer Fantasy Category:Adventure board games Category:Miniature wargames Category:Games Workshop games ","title":"Warhammer Quest"},{"id":"895030","text":"Statue of Knutsson in Vyborg, Russia. Torkel (Tyrgils or Torgils) Knutsson (d. 1306) was Lord High Constable of Sweden, member of the Privy Council of Sweden (Riksråd), and virtual ruler of Sweden during the early reign of King Birger Magnusson (1280–1321).  Biography  Torkel's coat of arms Torkel hailed from an old noble family of West Geatish ancestry and was related to the House of Bjelbo (Folkungaätten). He was first mentioned in 1282. In documents from 1288, he is mentioned as a knight and a member of the privy council (Riksråd). = Career = Before his death, King Magnus Ladulås (ca. 1240-1290) ordered his kinsman, Torgils Knutsson, the Constable of the Realm, to be the guardian of his son Birger. When King Magnus Ladulås died, Torkel became regent for the underage Birger Magnusson (1280–1321). When Tavastland had been attacked by the Republic of Novgorod, in 1292, Torkel led the Third Swedish Crusade against Novgorod, in 1293 and conquered parts of Karelia, where he founded the stronghold of Vyborg Castle. In 1299–1300, he led an attack against the Novgorodians, and he founded the Landskrona fortress on Okhta river at the influx of Neva. The old trade treaties with Lübeck were re-established, on condition that the town did not provide Novgorod with weapons or provisions. Torkel showed the same concerns about Swedish domestic politics. During his regency, the law of Uppland was established. He acted as Birger Jarl had done in the conflict against the church, in order to abolish the clergy's tax exemption. The clergy's discontent became apparent in 1303. In the struggles between King Birger Magnusson and his brothers, Erik Magnusson, Duke of Svealand (c. 1282 – 1318) and Valdemar Magnusson, Duke of Finland (c. 1282 – 1318), Torkel was faithfully on the king's side. At Torkel's castle Aranäs, in 1304, the two dukes had to sign a declaration that they would neither in Sweden, nor abroad, work against the king nor cause him harm. In spite of this declaration, the two dukes fled abroad and with the support of the Norwegian king Haakon V of Norway, they attacked Västergötland. Torkel helped the king conquer the castle of Nyköping, which belonged to Duke Eric, and in Kolsäter (1305), he forced the two dukes to sign a declaration that they would not cause any harm to Torkel either. When the power of the dukes was on the rise again, Torkel had to reconcile with the church, and he ordered a charter on the renewal of the church's old rights, in 1305. However, Torkel was finally struck by the vengeance of his enemies. The dukes managed to win the trust of the king and poisoned the king's mind against Torkel In December 1305, King Birger and the dukes arrived at Torkel's estate of Lena (where formerly the Battle of Lena had taken place) in Västergötland, and arrested Torkel who was taken to Stockholm in chains. In February 1306, the marshal was decapitated. His body was interred at the place of execution. It was later moved and buried at the Franciscan church in Stockholm. = Family = Torkel was married twice. His first wife, whose origins are unknown, gave him a daughter Kristina Torgilsdotter, who married Torkel's godson and later enemy Duke Valdemar. She appears to have been repudiated by the duke upon her father's execution, as Valdemar is soon reported to have married with Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway. Torkel's second wife was countess Hedvig of Ravensberg . Remembrance Torkel's powerful personality and tragic end has been the matter of poetry, in e.g. B. v. Beskow's tragedy Torkel Knutsson. A statue of Torkel (by Ville Vallgren) was raised, in 1908, on the square Rådhustorget in Vyborg. References Other sources *Lagerqvist, Lars O.

According to the two sagas, he was the son of an Erik who fought Harald Fairhair and who succeeded the brothers Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale: :King Önund had a son called Eric, and he succeeded to the throne at Upsala after his father. He was a rich King. In his days Harold the Fair-haired made himself King of Norway. He was the first to unite the whole of that country under his sway.

The latter saga relates that he ruled for 50 years: :There were disturbances also up in Gautland as long as King Eirik Eymundson lived; but he died when King Harald Harfager had been ten years king of all Norway.

Early on there are often no symptoms. Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Visual hallucinations may also occur but these do not represent a mental illness. Macular degeneration typically occurs in older people. Genetic factors and smoking also play a role. It is due to damage to the macula of the retina. Diagnosis is by a complete eye exam. The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types. The late type is additionally divided into \\"dry\\" and \\"wet\\" forms with the dry form making up 90% of cases. Preventive efforts include exercising, eating well, and not smoking. There is no cure or treatment that returns vision already lost. In the wet form, anti-VEGF medication injected into the eye or less commonly laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy may slow worsening. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals do not appear to be useful for prevention. However, dietary supplements may slow the progression in those who already have the disease. In 2015 it affected 6.2 million people globally. In 2013 it was the fourth most common cause of blindness after cataracts, preterm birth, and glaucoma. It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group. About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old.  Signs and symptoms  Normal vision rightthumbThe same view with age-related macular degeneration. Signs and symptoms of macular degeneration include: ;Visual symptoms * Distorted vision in the form of metamorphopsia, in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central scotomas, shadows or missing areas of vision * Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test) * Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80 * Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels). * Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones * A loss in contrast sensitivity *Formed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD Macular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss. The area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information. The loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side. Most people find this difficult to do. In addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes. People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms. Risk factors * Aging: Advanced age is the strongest predictor of AMD, particularly over 50. * Family history: =Environment and lifestyle= *Smoking: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of AMD by two to three times that of someone who has never smoked, and may be the most important modifiable factor in its prevention. A review of previous studies found \\"a strong association between current smoking and AMD. ... Cigarette smoking is likely to have toxic effects on the retina.\\" *Hypertension (high blood pressure): In the ALIENOR study 2013, early and late AMD were not significantly associated with systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP), hypertension, or use of antihypertensive medications, but elevated pulse pressure [(PP) systolic BP minus diastolic BP] was significantly associated with an increased risk of late AMD. *Atherosclerosis *High cholesterol: Elevated cholesterol may increase the risk of AMD *Obesity: Abdominal obesity is a risk factor, especially among men *Fat intake: Consuming high amounts of certain fats, including saturated fats, trans fats, and omega-6 fatty acids, likely contributes to AMD, while monounsaturated fats are potentially protective. In particular, omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk of AMD. *Exposure to UV light from sunlight has been associated with an increased risk of developing AMD, although evidence is weaker than other causes. *Digital screen does not radiate harmful energy against human eyes, but staring at the screen for a long time without pauses does increase eye strain. There is no evidence to support the claim that exposure to digital screen contributes to the risk of macular degeneration. =Genetics= Recurrence ratios for siblings of an affected individual are three- to sixfold higher than in the general population. Genetic linkage analysis has identified 5 sets of gene variants at three locations on different chromosomes (1, 6 and 10) as explaining at least 50% of the risk. These genes have roles regulating the immune response, inflammatory processes and homeostasis of the retina. Variants of these genes give rise to different kinds of dysfunction in these processes. Over time, this results in accumulation of intracellular and extracellular metabolic debris. This can cause scarring of the retina or breakdown of its vascularization. Genetic tests are available for some of these gene variations. However, pathogenesis of macular degeneration is a complex interaction between genetics, environment and lifestyle, and presence of unfavorable genetic factors doesn't necessarily predict progression to disease. The three loci where identified gene variants are found are designated: * Complement Factor H (CFH) on chromosome 1 at location 1q31.3 * HTRA serine peptidase 1/Age Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (HTRA1/ARMS2) on chromosome 10 at location 10q26 * Complement Factor B/Complement Component 2 (CFB/CC2) on chromosome 6 at 6p21.3 Specific genes * Polymorphisms in genes for complement system proteins: The genes for the complement system proteins factor H (CFH), factor B (CFB) and factor 3 (C3) are strongly associated with a person's risk for developing AMD. CFH is involved in inhibiting the inflammatory response. The mutation in CFH (Y402H) results in reduced ability of CFH to regulate complement on critical surfaces such as the retina and leads to increased inflammatory response within the macula. Absence of the complement factor H-related genes R3 and R1 protects against AMD. Two independent studies in 2007 showed a certain common mutation Arg80Gly in the C3 gene, which is a central protein of the complement system, is strongly associated with the occurrence of AMD. The authors of both papers consider their study to underscore the influence of the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease. * In two 2006 studies, another gene that has implications for the disease, called HTRA1 (encoding a secreted serine protease), was identified. * Six mutations of the gene SERPING1 (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor, Clade G (C1 Inhibitor), Member 1) are associated with AMD. Mutations in this gene can also cause hereditary angioedema. * Fibulin-5 mutation: Rare forms of the disease are caused by genetic defects in fibulin-5, in an autosomal dominant manner. In 2004, Stone et al. performed a screen on 402 AMD patients and revealed a statistically significant correlation between mutations in fibulin-5 and incidence of the disease. Mitochondrial related gene polymorphisms such as that in the MT-ND2 molecule, predicts wet AMD. Pathophysiology Human eye cross-sectional view The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration is not well known, although some theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. The imbalance between the production of damaged cellular components and degradation leads to the accumulation of harmful products, for example, intracellular lipofuscin and extracellular drusen. Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss. In the dry (nonexudative) form, cellular debris called drusen accumulates between the retina and the choroid, causing atrophy and scarring to the retina. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid (neovascularization) behind the retina which can leak exudate and fluid and also cause hemorrhaging. Early work demonstrated a family of immune mediators was plentiful in drusen. Complement factor H (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene strongly associates with AMD. Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced. Lending credibility to this has been the discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including complement component 3 (C3). A powerful predictor of AMD is found on chromosome 10q26 at LOC 387715. An insertion/deletion polymorphism at this site reduces expression of the ARMS2 gene though destabilization of its mRNA through deletion of the polyadenylation signal. ARMS2 protein may localize to the mitochondria and participate in energy metabolism, though much remains to be discovered about its function. Other gene markers of progression risk includes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), suggesting a role for extracellular matrix metabolism in AMD progression. Variations in cholesterol metabolising genes such as the hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transferase, lipoprotein lipase and the ATP-binding cassette A1 correlate with disease progression. The early stigmata of disease, drusen, are rich in cholesterol, offering face validity to the results of genome-wide association studies. =Stages= In AMD there is a progressive accumulation of characteristic yellow deposits, called drusen (buildup of extracellular proteins and lipids), in the macula (a part of the retina), between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. This accumulation is believed to damage the retina over time. Amyloid beta, which builds up in Alzheimer's disease brains, is one of the proteins that accumulate in AMD, which is a reason why AMD is sometimes called \\"Alzheimer's of the eye\\" or \\"Alzheimer's of the retina\\". AMD can be divided into 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late, based partially on the extent (size and number) of drusen. AMD-like pathology begins with small yellow deposits (drusen) in the macula, between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD. In fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous, and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated cholesterol deposits. Early AMD Early AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic. Intermediate AMD Intermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities. Intermediate AMD may cause some vision loss, but, like early AMD, it is usually asymptomatic. Late AMD In late AMD, enough retinal damage occurs that, in addition to drusen, people will also begin to experience symptomatic central vision loss. The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD). =Dry AMD= Dry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD). This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy. Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80–90% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10–20% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type. Geographic atrophy Geographic atrophy (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function. There are multiple layers that make up the retina, and in geographic atrophy, there are three specific layers that undergo atrophy: the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the overlying photoreceptors. The three layers that undergo atrophy in geographic atrophy are all adjacent to each other. The photoreceptors are the most superficial and they are the cells that are responsible for converting energy from the light from the outside world, into an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. There are several functions of the retinal pigment epithelium. One of the main functions of the retinal pigment epithelium is to minimize oxidative stress. It does so by absorbing light, and thus preventing it from getting to the underlying layers. The layers underlying the retinal pigment epithelium are very vascularlized so they have very high oxygen tension. Thus, if light was to get to those layers, many free radicals would form and cause damage to nearby tissues. The deepest layer that undergoes atrophy in geographic atrophy is called the choriocappilaris. It is a capillary network that provides nutrients to the retinal pigment epithelium. The pathophysiology of geographic atrophy is still uncertain. Some studies questioned whether it was due to a deficient retinal pigment epithelium, leading to increased oxidative stress. Other studies have looked for inflammatory causes of damage. Thus far, the medical community is still not certain. Recent studies have begun to look at each layer individually. They found that decrease blood flow in the choriocapillaris precedes atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and the overlying photoreceptors. Since the choriocapillaris is a vascular layer, this maybe be used as an arugment for why geographic atrophy could be a disease due to decreased blood flow. =Wet AMD= Neovascular or exudative AMD, the \\"wet\\" form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth (choroidal neovascularization) in the choriocapillaris, through Bruch's membrane. It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because these blood vessels are abnormal, these are also more fragile than typical blood vessels, which ultimately leads to blood and protein leakage below the macula. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated. =Oxidative stress= Age-related accumulation of low-molecular-weight, phototoxic, pro-oxidant melanin oligomers within lysosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may be partly responsible for decreasing the digestive rate of photoreceptor outer rod segments (POS) by the RPE – autophagy. A decrease in the digestive rate of POS has been shown to be associated with lipofuscin formation – a classic sign associated with AMD.John Lacey, \\"Harvard Medical signs agreement with Merck to develop potential therapy for macular degeneration \\", 23 May 2006 The role of retinal oxidative stress in the cause of AMD by resulting in further inflammation of the macula is suggested by the enhanced rate of disease in smokers and those exposed to UV irradiation. Mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role.  Diagnosis  Super resolution microscopic investigation of human eye tissue affected by AMD Diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration depends on signs in the macula, not necessarily vision. Wet AMD is typically the advanced progression of dry AMD and will require additional diagnostic tools. Additionally, early diagnosis of wet AMD can prevent further visual deterioration and potentially improve vision. Diagnosis of dry (or early stage) AMD may include the following clinical examinations as well as procedures and tests: * The transition from dry to wet AMD can happen rapidly, and if it is left untreated can lead to legal blindness in as little as six months. To prevent this from occurring and to initiate preventive strategies earlier in the disease process, dark adaptation testing may be performed. A dark adaptometer can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident. *There is a loss of contrast sensitivity, so that contours, shadows, and color vision are less vivid. The loss in contrast sensitivity can be quickly and easily measured by a contrast sensitivity test like Pelli Robson performed either at home or by an eye specialist. * When viewing an Amsler grid, some straight lines appear wavy and some patches appear blank * When viewing a Snellen chart, at least 2 lines decline * In dry macular degeneration, which occurs in 85–90 percent of AMD cases, drusen spots can be seen in Fundus photography * Using an electroretinogram, points in the macula with a weak or absent response compared to a normal eye may be found *Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and Maximum Color Contrast Sensitivity test (MCCS) for assessing color acuity and color contrast sensitivity *Optical coherence tomography is now used by most ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and the follow-up evaluation of the response to treatment with antiangiogenic drugs. Diagnosis of wet (or late stage) AMD may include the following in addition to the above tests: * Preferential hyperacuity perimetry changes (for wet AMD). Preferential hyperacuity perimetry is a test that detects drastic changes in vision and involves the macula being stimulated with distorted patterns of dots and the patient identification of where in the visual field this occurs. * In wet macular degeneration, angiography can visualize the leakage of bloodstream behind the macula. Fluorescein angiography allows for the identification and localization of abnormal vascular processes. =Histology= * Pigmentary changes in the retina – In addition to the pigmented cells in the iris (the colored part of the eye), there are pigmented cells beneath the retina. As these cells break down and release their pigment, dark clumps of released pigment and later, areas that are less pigmented may appear * Exudative changes: hemorrhages in the eye, hard exudates, subretinal/sub-RPE/intraretinal fluid * Drusen, tiny accumulations of extracellular material that build up on the retina. While there is a tendency for drusen to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, drusen deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss. Some patients with large deposits of drusen have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of drusen are present, then, even if drusen can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision. Prevention A 2017 Cochrane review found the use of vitamin and mineral supplements, alone or in combination, by the general population did not affect whether or not AMD started.  Management  Treatment of AMD varies depending on the category of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, treatment is aimed at slowing down the progression of AMD.Bishop P. Age-related macular degeneration. BMJ Best Practice. 2018. As of 2018, there are no treatments to reverse the effects of AMD. Early-stage and intermediate- stage AMD is managed by modifying known risk factors such as smoking and atherosclerosis and making dietary modifications. For intermediate-stage AMD, management also includes antioxidant and mineral supplementation. Advanced- stage AMD is managed based on the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV): dry AMD (no CNV present) or wet AMD (CNV present). No effective treatments exist for dry AMD. The CNV present in wet AMD is managed with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. =Dry AMD= No medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition. =Wet AMD= Ranibizumab, aflibercept, and brolucizumab are approved VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of CNV in wet AMD. All three drugs are administered via intravitreal injection, meaning they are injected directly into the eye. Bevacizumab is another VEGF inhibitor that has been shown to have similar efficacy and safety as the previous two drugs, however, is not currently indicated for AMD. AMD can also be treated with laser coagulation therapy. A randomized control trial found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy, and reported no significant increase in adverse events with bevacizumab. A 2014 Cochrane review found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are similar when used to treat neovascular AMD, except for gastrointestinal disorders. Bevacizumab however is not FDA approved for treatment of macular degeneration. A controversy in the UK involved the off-label use of cheaper bevacizumab over the approved, but expensive, ranibizumab. Ranibizumab is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. Other approved antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of neo-vascular AMD include pegaptanib and aflibercept.FDA approves Eylea for macular degeneration The American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines do not recommend laser coagulation therapy for macular degeneration, but state that it may be useful in people with new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea who don't respond to drug treatment. There is strong evidence that laser coagulation will result in the disappearance of drusen but does not affect choroidal neovascularisation. A 2007 Cochrane review on found that laser photocoagulation of new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea is effective and economical method, but that the benefits are limited for vessels next to or below the fovea. Photodynamic therapy has also been used to treat wet AMD. The drug verteporfin is administered intravenously; light of a certain wavelength is then applied to the abnormal blood vessels. This activates the verteporfin destroying the vessels. Cataract surgery could improve visual outcomes for people with AMD, though there have been concerns about surgery increasing the progression of AMD. A randomized controlled trial found that people who underwent immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) had improved visual acuity and better quality of life outcomes than those who underwent delayed cataract surgery (6 months). = Adaptive devices = Josef Tal, an Israeli composer who was affected by macular degeneration, checks a manuscript using a CCTV desktop unit. Because peripheral vision is not affected, people with macular degeneration can learn to use their remaining vision to partially compensate. Assistance and resources are available in many countries and every state in the U.S. Classes for \\"independent living\\" are given and some technology can be obtained from a state department of rehabilitation. Adaptive devices can help people read. These include magnifying glasses, special eyeglass lenses, computer screen readers, and TV systems that enlarge reading the material. Computer screen readers such as JAWS or Thunder work with standard Windows computers. Also, Apple devices provide a wide range of features (voice-over, screen readers, Braille etc.). Video cameras can be fed into standard or special-purpose computer monitors, and the image can be zoomed in and magnified. These systems often include a movable table to move the written material. Accessible publishing provides larger fonts for printed books, patterns to make tracking easier, audiobooks and DAISY books with both text and audio. Epidemiology Disability- adjusted life year for macular degeneration and other (sense organ diseases) per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004 The prevalence any age-related macular degeneration is higher in Europeans than in Asians and Africans. There is no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans. The incidence of age- related macular degeneration and its associated features increases with age and is low in people <55 years of age. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor. Age-related macular degeneration accounts for more than 54% of all vision loss in the white population in the USA. An estimated 8 million Americans are affected with early age-related macular degeneration, of whom over 1 million will develop advanced age-related macular degeneration within the next 5 years. In the UK, age-related macular degeneration is the cause of blindness in almost 42% of those who go blind aged 65–74 years, almost two- thirds of those aged 75–84 years, and almost three-quarters of those aged 85 years or older. Research directions =Association with other age-related diseases= Studies indicate drusen associated with AMD are similar in molecular composition to Beta-Amyloid (βA) plaques and deposits in other age- related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. This suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases. =Genetic testing= A practical application of AMD-associated genetic markers is in the prediction of progression of AMD from early stages of the disease to neovascularization. =Stem cell transplant= Cell based therapies using bone marrow stem cells as well as retinal pigment epithelial transplantation are being studied. A number of trials have occurred in humans with encouraging results. Other types There are a few other (rare) kinds of macular degeneration with similar symptoms but unrelated in etiology to Wet or Dry age-related macular degeneration. They are all genetic disorders that may occur in childhood or middle age. *Vitelliform macular dystrophy * Sorsby's fundus dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, retinal disease characterized by sudden acuity loss resulting from untreatable submacular neovascularisation * Stargardt's disease (juvenile macular degeneration, STGD) is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by juvenile-onset macular dystrophy, alterations of the peripheral retina, and subretinal deposition of lipofuscin-like material. Similar symptoms with a very different etiology and different treatment can be caused by epiretinal membrane or macular pucker or any other condition affecting the macula, such as central serous retinopathy.

Traditional flamenco had been displaced in Spain in the 1950s and 1960s by rock-and-roll. Artists such as Camarón de la Isla worked with the music during that period, infusing it with new sound. However it was during the 1980s that revival really took off, by artists such as Paco de Lucía, Tomatito, Pata Negra, Ketama, and later more mainstream stylists, such as the Gipsy Kings. The artists fused it with other forms, including jazz and salsa. Although fused with other music, it was still based on the classic flamenco the artists had grown up with, a new form of the old. Among the artists wrongly associated with this style is Ottmar Liebert.

Early life John Jay Hooker was born to relative wealth and privilege in one of the Nashville area's more prominent families in 1930. His father, John Jay Hooker, Sr., was one of the Nashville area's best-known and most respected attorneys, as is John Jay's brother, Henry Hooker, who became his law partner in the former firm of Hooker, Hooker, and Willis. Hooker was a direct descendant of William Blount, who signed the Constitution of the United States and who was appointed by President George Washington in 1790 to be the \\"Governor of all the lands south of the Ohio River\\". In 1796, Governor Blount was elected the president of the Constitutional Convention of Tennessee. Legal career Hooker attended Sewanee Military Academy (now St. Andrew's-Sewanee School) and graduated from Nashville's Montgomery Bell Academy, Hooker attended college at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He then served two years in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps as an investigator. Upon discharge from the service, Hooker attended Vanderbilt University Law School. He graduated and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1957. He then practiced law with his father in the law firm of Hooker, Keeble, Dodson, and Harris, one of the most prominent law firms in Tennessee. In 1960, Hooker left his father's law firm to start a new law firm and one year later was joined by his brother Henry Hooker, and two years later by William R. Willis, forming the law firm of Hooker, Hooker, and Willis, which eventually became a ten-man law firm. This firm became the general counsel of the Nashville Tennessean and several other businesses by the time Hooker ran for governor in 1966. Struck by the inequalities in the southern society that confronted him at the time, he became identified as a young man with progressive Democratic politics. While practicing law, he also began a series of diverse business investments. In 1958, Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement asked Hooker and prominent Nashville attorney Jack Norman Sr. to become involved in the state's investigation of Raulston Schoolfield, an allegedly corrupt Chattanooga state judge. Based on the Norman/Hooker findings, the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to impeach Schoolfield. Norman and Hooker were then retained to prosecute Schoolfield before the Tennessee State Senate, which convicted him on several counts. At the time, Robert F. Kennedy was general counsel of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, which was investigating labor corruption. In this capacity, Kennedy launched an investigation of Raulston Schoolfield. Kennedy came to Tennessee and testified in the Schoolfield impeachment trial. Thereafter, he and Hooker became close friends and remained so until the time of Kennedy's assassination in 1968. Political career In 1959, Hooker married the former Eugenia \\"Tish\\" Fort, a member of another socially-prominent Nashville family. They had three children, Dara, Kendall, and Blount, who was named after his ancestor Governor Blount. The Fort family were co-founders along with other families of the former National Life and Accident Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, WSM radio and the Grand Ole Opry country music program. Hooker also was close friends with Amon Evans, whose family then owned and published The Tennessean, then as now, the most prominent newspaper in Middle Tennessee. Thereafter, Hooker convinced Evans to employ John Seigenthaler as the editor of the newspaper. Seigenthaler likewise had an association with Robert F. Kennedy that emanated from the Schoolfield investigation and trial. Thereafter, Seigenthaler was a major political supporter of Robert Kennedy and of Hooker. With the support and backing of the Evans family and John Seigenthaler, Hooker decided to enter the 1966 Democratic primary for governor of Tennessee. His opponent was Buford Ellington, a former governor attempting a return to the office who had the strong backing of the incumbent governor, Clement, and President Lyndon Johnson, who was Ellington's close personal friend and who had appointed him to a prominent position at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ellington was also strongly backed by the other Nashville newspaper, the Nashville Banner. Supported by some of the more progressive members of the Nashville business community, and using innovative advertising such as sponsoring NASCAR driver Buddy Baker's racecar, Hooker underwent a blistering counterattack which was mounted by Ellington's \\"Old Guard\\" supporters. Hooker ran fairly well in the urban and rural areas, but lost badly in the suburbs, to which the Old Guard's support had largely moved in the post-World War II era. Ellington went on to an easy victory in November, with no Republican opposition, the last time such a circumstance was to occur in Tennessee. During this period, Hooker and Tish made a campaign appearance at a Nashville church attended by the very young Oprah Winfrey and her family. Tish, as Oprah recounted later, took the time to speak to the young girl, and told her she was \\"pretty as a speckled pup.\\" Many years later, Tish was invited to appear on Oprah's television show, where Oprah acknowledged how much those kind words had meant to her. During the next four years, Hooker divided his time between two major activities - investments and planning to run for governor again in 1970. Politically, he kept up his connection with Bobby Kennedy and other members of the Kennedy political family, and was greatly saddened when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. By this time Hooker had many diversified investments including Whale Inc. and a chain of fried chicken restaurants with country comedian Minnie Pearl and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. His rationale for the chicken restaurants was that just as Pepsi had long made a large amount of money as the primary competitor to Coca-Cola, someone else stood to make a comparable fortune as the primary competitor to Kentucky Fried Chicken. Hooker was also closely involved around the same time with the Frist family and others in the formation of what became the first major for-profit healthcare chain, the Hospital Corporation of America. Hooker won the 1970 Democratic nomination for governor of Tennessee over a host of competitors, most notably the candidate of the \\"Old Guard\\", Nashville attorney Stan Snodgrass, who had the endorsement of the Nashville Banner. In the past, the Democratic nomination would have assured him victory in November. But many things had changed in Tennessee in the four years since his loss to Ellington. For one, the Republican Party was benefitting greatly from the Southern strategy of then-President Richard Nixon to reach out to rural and working-class urban Southern whites who were disturbed by desegregation and other rapid social changes. Tennessee Republicans, only just over two years from failing to field a gubernatorial candidate, had even managed to organize the Tennessee House of Representatives for the first (and only) time in the 20th century in 1969, and they were not about to allow what appeared to them to be a golden opportunity to pass them by. In 1966, Howard Baker had beaten Governor Frank Clement for the United States Senate because the Democratic party was divided between the Clement/Ellington forces and the anti-Clement/Ellington forces, as best exemplified in the heated primary battle that year between Ellington and Hooker, and the absence of a gubernatorial nominee had in fact allowed Republicans to focus almost all of their energies on electing Baker to the Senate seat. Events as well as people seemed to conspire against Hooker in the fall of 1970. The Republicans had staged a very hard-fought primary race of their own, but had come out of it largely united behind the candidacy of Memphis dentist Dr. Winfield Dunn, former chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party. Many of Snodgrass' erstwhile supporters, including the Nashville Banner, endorsed Dunn. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission had in 1969 announced an investigation into Minnie Pearl's Chicken, and over time as a consequence of the investigation the price the stock had declined from a high of $40 a share to approximately 50 cents a share. Simultaneously, Democratic Senator Albert Gore, Sr. was running an equally hard-fought and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for a fourth term against Chattanooga Congressman William E. Brock. The friendly relationship both Gore and Hooker shared with the Kennedy family became an issue, especially in light of Ted Kennedy's involvement in the Chappaquiddick incident the previous year. Republicans and \\"Old Guard\\" detractors alike pilloried the two, leading to a Republican sweep and for the first time in the post-Reconstruction era the Republicans held the Tennessee governorship and both United States Senate seats (although, curiously, they lost control of the state House of Representatives and did not gain it again it until the beginning of the 21st century). Hooker was never convicted of any criminal wrongdoing in the SEC/Minnie Pearl Chicken case. Nonetheless, the SEC investigation, which lasted three years, caused the company virtually to liquidate, although a few outlets continued to function into the 1980s. Hooker claimed until his death that the SEC investigation was unjustified and totally politically inspired by the Nixon Administration, which wanted to defeat Albert Gore Sr. and Hooker because they were anti-war candidates. Hooker also claimed that the Nixon political \\"machine\\" challenged Hooker and Gore as part of its \\"Southern strategy\\". Later life Hooker served as chairman of STP Corporation from 1973 to 1976. In 1976 he entered the Democratic Primary for Brock's U.S. Senate seat and was at first perhaps favored to win the nomination, but was defeated by the previously-little-known Jim Sasser for the nomination. (Sasser was well known by Tennessee Democratic insiders, however, as the manager of the last, unsuccessful campaign of Albert Gore Sr. six years earlier. Sasser defeated Brock in November and went on to serve three terms in the Senate.) In 1979, Hooker arranged for the sale of The Tennessean newspaper to Gannett, which had earlier purchased the Banner but preferred to own morning rather than evening papers. At the same time, his own investment group purchased the Banner from Gannett (the two papers were linked by a joint operating agreement) and Hooker became publisher of the very paper that had so tormented him only nine years earlier. In retrospect, he has called this perhaps the greatest single moment of his life. Hooker, however, sold his portion of the Banner in 1982 and became chairman for a period of United Press International, the historical but faltering competitor to the Associated Press in the wire service news business. Hooker's fortunes seemed to ebb and flow in the 1980s. At one point, he became rather prosperous again. He promoted a new fast food chain, named for himself, which sold hamburgers from small, drive-by only buildings, operating this venture from 1984 to 1986 before selling it, for $3 million. One of these outlets was built in the Nashville area and several in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He remained friends with many prominent persons, however, including former heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali and became friends with H. Ross Perot. Hooker always claimed to have been the first and primary counselor in Perot's decision to run for President of the United States in 1992. Hooker began to file to run for various political offices including governor, Senator, Congressman, and others, for the purpose of acquiring the legal standing to sue all of these persons running for the office for taking campaign contributions from \\"out of state\\" contributors, which according to his legal theories were both illegal and unconstitutional, and Hooker continued to bring lawsuits in that regard down through the early part of the 21st century. In 1995 he even sued President Bill Clinton, as well as all of the other presidential candidates, for accepting certain campaign contributions, which according to his theory were unconstitutional. He sued the Tennessee Supreme Court, saying that their elections under the \\"Modified Missouri Plan\\" were unconstitutional, eventually forcing them to recuse themselves from their own case and require the empanelment of a special State Supreme Court to hear the charges (this panel wound up dismissing Hooker's claims though). Although his later campaigns were basically efforts to draw attention to the amount of money which came into Tennessee politics from \\"out of state\\" and its alleged corrupting influence, he unexpectedly received the 1998 Democratic nomination for governor. No other prominent Democrat had filed to oppose incumbent Republican governor Don Sundquist, and Hooker defeated a field of other \\"token\\" candidates as well as the supposedly \\"serious\\" candidate with union backing, Mark Whitaker, who was selected the\\"sacrificial lamb\\" of the party leadership. Hooker won the nomination based on tremendous name recognition among older Democrats, who are in Tennessee generally the most reliable primary voters. He ran best in the rural areas and with urban blacks, who had always provided him with a core support group. While not formally disavowing him, the regular Democratic Party organization did almost nothing to promote his candidacy, and Hooker had disavowed the formal fundraising process as unethical and immoral. Hooker received about 30 percent of the vote in the November general election. At this time Governor Sundquist had a 72 percent approval rating. Hooker remained a political activist, running for Congress in 2002 and again suing all his opponents, and then for Chancery Court judge in 2004 as an Independent against Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman. He sued her for taking campaign contributions from lawyers who practiced in her court and then attended fundraisers held by her at which, according to Hooker, she furnished them with food and drink as prohibited by Article X Section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution. In 2006 Hooker filed to run for the Democratic nomination for both governor of Tennessee and United States Senator. Despite refusing to raise or spend any money in these efforts, Hooker nonetheless finished third in the senatorial primary and second in the gubernatorial primary held on August 3. He ran for Governor as an Independent in the 2014 election, and in 2015 worked to legalize physician-assisted suicide in Tennessee. On January 24, 2016, John Jay Hooker died of cancer at the age of 85.

It is operated by the Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society, incorporated in 1972 as the successor to the Thunder Bay Historical Society. The Museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, the Ontario Historical Society, and Virtual Museum of Canada. History The Thunder Bay Historical Society was founded October 2, 1908 at the instance of Barlow Cumberland, president of the Ontario Historical Society. Peter McKellar served as president of the Thunder Bay Historical Society from 1908 to 1923. Since 1994 the museum has been housed in the former Fort William police station and court house near Thunder Bay City Hall. The three-storey building, designed by architect Robert Mason, was erected in 1910 and is an example of Classical Revival architecture, with its two large Corinthian columns and pilasters. Fund raising is under way to restore the cornice and other missing architectural elements. The interior of the building has been treated with complete renovations since 1994, including an overhaul of its HVAC system and the addition of a wheelchair ramp. An annex was enlarged and converted to a storage area for the collection. Recently a visible storage gallery was built in front of the annex to display vehicles and other large items in the museum's collection. Collection The first floor gallery features permanent exhibits on various aspects of local history. The second floor gallery is known as the James Murphy Room and is dedicated to meetings and programming, such as birthday parties and themed march & summer break camps for children. The third floor gallery features military and music exhibits, local and traveling exhibit space as well as a multipurpose room available for rentals. The museum collects objects of regional interest, such as dolls, pictures and furniture, and its collection includes a firetruck. The archives has 130 metres of linear records, 1900 maps and plans, 150,000 photographic images and a 2200 volume library. Program The Society produces an annual peer- reviewed journal entitled Papers & Records. It is also publishes a number of books annually on a variety of local and regional interest.

The first of these, in 1884-1885 was what was then diagnosed as dementia praecox (later known as paranoid schizophrenia or schizophrenia, paranoid type). He described his second mental illness, from 1893–1902, making also a brief reference to the first disorder from 1884–1885, in his book Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (original German title Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken). The Memoirs became an influential book in the history of psychiatry and psychoanalysis thanks to its interpretation by Sigmund Freud. There is no personal account of his third disorder, in 1907–1911, but some details about it can be found in the Hospital Chart (in the Appendix to Lothane's book). During his second illness he was treated by Prof. Paul Flechsig (Leipzig University Clinic), Dr. Pierson (Lindenhof), and Dr. Guido Weber (Royal Public Asylum, Sonnenstein). Schreber's experiences Schreber was a successful and highly respected judge until middle age when the onset of his psychosis occurred. He woke up one morning with the thought that it would be pleasant to \\"succumb\\" to sexual intercourse as a woman. He was alarmed and felt that this thought had come from somewhere else, not from himself. He even hypothesized that the thought had come from a doctor who had experimented with hypnosis on him; he thought that the doctor had telepathically invaded his mind. He believed his primary psychiatrist, Prof. Paul Flechsig, had contact with him using a \\"nerve- language\\" of which Schreber said humans are unaware. He believed that hundreds of people's souls took special interest in him, and contacted his nerves by using \\"divine rays\\", telling him special information, or requesting things of him. During one of his stays at the Sonnenstein asylum, he concluded that there are \\"fleeting-improvised-men\\" in the world, which he believed were divinely fabricated men, as miracles to provide Schreber with \\"play-with- humans\\" in light of a depopulation of the world. As his psychosis progressed, he believed that God was turning him into a woman, sending rays down to enact 'miracles' upon him, including little men to torture him. Schreber was released from psychiatric hospitals around 1902, shortly before the publication of his book. He resumed his private activities, which he conducted very well up until 1907, when his mother died. He then went through a final hospitalisation. Schreber died on 14 April 1911 in the Leipzig-Dosen asylum. = Schreber's book = Though Schreber's book was made famous because of its value as a psychological memoir, psychology was not his aim. Schreber's purpose was expressed in its subtitle (which was not translated as part of the English edition, but fully reproduced inside it): \\"In what circumstance can a person deemed insane be detained in an asylum against his declared will?\\" Schreber, who was an accomplished jurist, wrote these memoirs in order to pose a legal question: to what extent is it legitimate to keep someone like himself in an asylum when he expressly declares he desires his liberty? The fundamental unit of Schreber's ruminations were what he called \\"nerves\\", which were said to compose both the human soul and the nature of God in relation to humanity. Each human soul was composed of nerves that derived from God, whose own nerves were then the ultimate source of human existence. Schreber's thought that God's nerves and those of humanity existed parallel to one another except when the \\"Order of the World\\" was violated which constituted the fundamental premise of Schreber's memoirs, in which the two universes experienced dangerous \\"nerve-contact\\" with each other. For Schreber, this was focused upon his personal and institutional relationship with Dr. Flechsig, who became a rebellious \\"nerve specialist\\" by virtue of his psychiatric power in contrast to the \\"Omnipotence\\" of God. The peculiar universe of Schreber's was mediated by the activity of rays, which could assume a \\"pure\\" and \\"impure\\" relation; these rays could be controlled by Flechsig or emanated strictly from God, who sought to influence Schreber and his reality by \\"divine miracles\\". The rays had the capacity for independent activity, though they were distinguished from souls and nerves (generally identical) which emanated from other human beings deceased or living. Within Schreber's cosmology the universe as an observable reality, and the Sun especially, was a partially independent realm which God merely communicated through, using rays and miracles to influence at times when the \\"Order of the World\\" needed to be adjusted. Strictly speaking, God only initiated nerve-contact with human beings through dreams or inspired states (in poetry, etc.), or when humans had become corpses and returned to the \\"forecourts of Heaven\\" after purification to rejoin the 'nerve soul' of God. However, the entire crisis which Schreber describes in his book is the dangerous combination between humanity and God within the mind of Schreber. Schreber's ruminations can be schematized in this way: *God - Upper and lower (Ormuzd and Ahriman respectively, derived from Persian theology) *The \\"forecourts of Heaven\\" - The \\"states of Blessedness\\" where deceased humans' souls reside after a process of \\"purification\\" (These are called the \\"anterior realms of God\\" in contradistinction to the \\"posterior\\" realms which consist of the upper and lower Gods) *The Universe - Separated from the transcendental sphere of God providing the human/material world and yet threatening God's invested existence within it; celestial bodies allow the means for God's life/light to interact with His creations *Divine rays - Semi-sentient entities (which are the cosmic fuel of God's Omnipotence, and influence Schreber and the world but can be manipulated by Flechsig) *Nerves/Souls - The spiritual bodies of humans which are active whether the living person is alive or dead, and go through various states of purification in order to return to God's nerves in a \\"state of Blessedness\\" There is no Hell in Schreber's cosmology. Freud's interpretation and its criticisms Although Freud never interviewed Schreber himself, he read his Memoirs and drew his own conclusions from it in an essay entitled \\"Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)\\" (1911). Freud thought that Schreber's disturbances resulted from repressed homosexual desires, which in infancy were oriented at his father and brother. Repressed inner drives were projected onto the outside world and led to intense hallucinations which were first centred on his physician Dr. Flechsig (projection of his feelings towards his brother), and then around God (who represented Schreber's father, Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber). During the first phase of his illness Schreber was certain that Dr. Flechsig persecuted him and made direct attempts to murder his soul and change him into a woman (he had what Freud thought to be emasculation hallucinations, which were in fact, according to Schreber's words an \\"unmanning\\" (Entmannung) experience. In the next period of his ailment he was convinced that God and the order of things demanded of him that he must be turned into a woman so that he could be the sole object of sexual desire of God. Consideration of the Schreber case led Freud to revise received classification of mental disturbances. He argued that the difference between paranoia and dementia praecox is not at all clear, since symptoms of both ailments may be combined in any proportion, as in Schreber's case. Therefore, Freud concluded, it may be necessary to introduce a new diagnostic notion: paranoid dementia, which does justice to polymorphous mental disturbances such as those exhibited by the judge. Freud's interpretation has been contested by a number of subsequent theorists, most notably Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their work Anti-Oedipus and elsewhere. Their reading of Schreber's Memoirs is a part of their wider criticism of familial orientation of psychoanalysis and it foregrounds the political and racial elements of the text; they see Schreber's written experience of reality abnormal only in its honesty about the experience of power in late capitalism. Elias Canetti also devoted the closing chapters of his theoretical magnum opus Crowds and Power to a reading of Schreber. Finally, Jacques Lacan's Seminar on the Psychoses and one of his écrits \\"On a Question prior to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis\\" are predominantly concerned with reading and evaluating Schreber's text over-against Freud's original and originating interpretation. Schatzman's interpretation In 1974, Morton Schatzman published Soul Murder, in which he gave his own interpretation of Schreber's psychosis. Schatzman's interpretation was in turn based on W. G. Niederland's research from the 1950s, (Niederland had previously worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps).Niederland, W. G. Schreber: Father and Son. Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 28 Apr 1959 (2), 151-169 Schatzman had found child-rearing pamphlets written by Moritz Schreber, Daniel Schreber's father, which stressed the necessity of taming the rebellious savage beast in the child and turning him into a productive citizen. Many of the techniques recommended by Moritz Schreber were mirrored in Daniel Schreber's psychotic experiences. For example, one of the \\"miracles\\" described by Daniel Schreber was that of chest compression, of tightening and tightening. This can be seen as analogous to one of Moritz Schreber's techniques of an elaborate contraption which confined the child's body, forcing him to have a \\"correct\\" posture at the dinner table. Similarly, the \\"freezing miracle\\" might mirror Moritz Schreber's recommendation of placing the infant in a bath of ice cubes beginning at age three months. Daniel Paul Schreber's older brother, Daniel Gustav Schreber, committed suicide in his thirties. Han Israels argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman, claiming that Schreber's father had been unfairly criticized in the literature, in his 1989 book Schreber: Father and Son.Israels, H. (1989). Schreber: Father and Son. Madison: International Universities Press. Lothane's interpretation More recently, Henry Zvi Lothane has argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman in his book In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry.Lothane. H. (1992). In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry. Hillsdale, NJ/London: The Analytic Press. Second, German edition, Lothane, Z. (2004). Seelenmord und Psychiatrie Zur Rehabilitierung Schrebers. Giessen: Psychosozial-Verlag. (2nd edition of ‘’In Defense of Schreber’’ Lothane's Schreber research included the study of archival records concerning the relationship between Schreber and the other significant people in his life, including his wife and his doctors. On Lothane's account, the existing literature on Schreber as a rule (1) leaves substantial gaps in the historical records which careful archival research could in some measure fill; (2) leaves out psychoanalytically significant relationships, such as that between Schreber and his wife and (3) overstates the purportedly sadistic elements in Schreber's father's child-rearing techniques.Lothane, Z. (1992). In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry. Hillsdale, NJ/London: The Analytic Press Lothane's interpretation of Schreber also differs from previous texts in that he considers Schreber a worthwhile thinker.Lothane, Z. (2011).

From 2007, when about 1,194 pups were born to 3,500 resident grey seal colony, births rates have grown to 2,066 pups born over the 2018 season . A double wooden fence was erected in 2007 to stop people touching the newborn pups. The reserve, staffed by volunteer wardens, is accessible to the public. Media coverage of Donna Nook has led to a big increase in visitor numbers; it was visited by about 43,000 people in 2006. Surplus money collected through sales is used to further support the protection of seals. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust has asked walkers and photographers to stay in the public viewing area and to avoid going out onto the sands, following an increase in seal mortality which coincided with an increase in visitor numbers in 2010 and criticism of the disturbance caused by photographers.

Its motto is \\"Vigilamus\\" (translates to \\"We are watching\\"). It is a radar base and is also part of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). As part of intelligence-sharing arrangements between the United States and United Kingdom (see, for example, the UKUSA Agreement), data collected at RAF Fylingdales are shared between the two countries. Its primary purpose is to give the British and US governments warning of an impending ballistic missile attack (part of the so-called four minute warning during the Cold War). A secondary role is the detection and tracking of orbiting objects; Fylingdales is part of the United States Space Surveillance Network. As well as its early-warning and space-tracking roles, Fylingdales has a third function - the Satellite Warning Service for the UK. It keeps track of spy satellites used by other countries, so that secret activities in the UK can be carried out when they are not overhead. The armed services, defence manufacturers and research organisations, including universities, take advantage of this facility. History =Cold War= The radomes at Fylingdales in 1986 The Solid State Phased Array Radar (SSPAR) The station was sited on a former wartime mortar range on Snod Hill, which had to be comprehensively cleared by RAF Bomb Disposal before building could begin. The station was built by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1962, and was maintained by RCA (Great Britain), now Serco Group plc. RAF Fylingdales consisted of three diameter 'golfballs' or geodesic domes (radomes) containing mechanically steered radar. Operation of the Fylingdales Site transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 15 January 1964 although the site became operational on 17 September 1963. It became a local tourist attraction as a result. Coach tours to the nearby coastal town of Whitby drove past the site, at which point drivers would typically switch the radio on and allow passengers to listen to the interference caused by the radars. Between 1989 and 1992, Raytheon, the US defence contractor, completed a contract that saw the domes replaced by the current tetrahedron ('pyramid') structure, housing the AESA phased array radar. The site is above sea level and the structure is nine floors high rising from its ground level to high. =National Missile Defense= In the late 1990s, the United States decided to pursue a National Missile Defense plan fully, and RAF Fylingdales attracted further publicity. To improve tracking capabilities (for launches from Africa and the Middle East) the United States wanted the use of Fylingdales as part of its NMD network. After receiving a formal request from the US, the British Government agreed to its use as an NMD tracking facility, in 2003. The decision was criticised, because the proposed NMD system was solely for US benefit. A £449 million upgrade for RAF Fylingdales to become an NMD tracking facility is now underway by Boeing, with Raytheon as the major subcontractor. It will replace many internal systems - computers, displays, etc - to improve resolution and tracking accuracy. No external changes are being made in direct relation to these upgrades and no power increases will occur. According to the BBC, The Independent reported that the British Government secretly agreed to a US request to station NMD missile interceptors at Fylingdales Moor in late 2004. This has subsequently been denied by the Ministry of Defence. =Health fears= In June 2003, concern arose locally that RAF Fylingdales was emitting harmful emissions, after a possible cancer cluster was discovered around a similar radar facility on Cape Cod in the United States. The issue was investigated by the local NHS organisation, the Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale Primary Care Trust, and a report was released in December. It concluded that there was no link between RAF Fylingdales and local cancer rates, nor any abnormal risk, as cancer rates in the immediate area proved to be normal. A 2003 MoD report on the impact of the NMD upgrade at RAF Fylingdales reiterated that the base was within health guidelines and would remain so. Operation =BMEWS= While the radar station remains a British asset operated and commanded by the Royal Air Force, it also forms one of three stations in the United States BMEWS network (the United States also funds the cost of the radar units). The other two stations in the network are Thule Air Base, Greenland and Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. The data obtained by Fylingdales is shared fully and freely with the United States, where it feeds into the US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. To this end a United States Air Force liaison officer is stationed at the base. The British Government advised in March 2018, that as of the beginning of that month, fewer than five United States military personnel and ten US contractors worked at the station. Space Delta 4 of the United States Space Force, maintains a liaison officer at Fylingdales to act as link to US missile warning operations and advises the RAF station commander on operational issues. =Systems= The primary radars of RAF Fylingdales are active electronically scanned array (AESA) phased array radars, mounted on each face of a truncated tetrahedron, typically referred to as the \\"pyramid\\" or the SSPAR (Solid State Phased Array). This makes Fylingdales unique amongst its peers in that it covers a full 360 degrees. Each of the three arrays is across and contains around 2560 transmit/receive modules; mean power output is about , with a tracking range of . =Controversy= The functions of RAF Fylingdales have been subject to criticism from opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), leading to protests being held on occasion. These stem from concerns regarding the base's association with nuclear warfare and the militarisation of space. They argue against the UK assisting the US National Missile Defense (NMD) programme with RAF Fylingdales' ability to detect attacks, saying it is destabilising US and European relations with Russia, makes the UK the front line in any future conflict and it could be information from Fylingdales that initiates a nuclear response from the US and/or the UK to a perceived threat – real or false; intended or accidental. The radar beam has created serious concern of radiation risks due to leakage from the sides of the beams -“side lobes”. Although the radiation levels are within UK limits (NRPB), it would be harder for the base to keep within the tighter EU limits (INIRPB), which the UK may soon adopt, though pulling out of the EU makes this less likely. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) defends the use and role of the facility, regarding RAF Fylingdales as part of the UK's contribution to counter a military threat. The MoD states that, although ballistic missile attack is a minor threat currently, this could change in the long-term future, if as yet unknown enemies develop missiles as a means to overcome large distances to strike at the UK. =Cultural references= * The monitoring function is referred to in the Jethro Tull song \\"Fylingdale Flyer\\" which appears on the album A and in the Slipstream video. * In the classic Doctor Who story Remembrance of the Daleks, the Doctor asks Group Captain Gilmore to contact multiple space- capable radar installations, including Jodrell Bank and \\"the Fylingdale installations\\". * In the 1983 film The Day After, the Fylingdales facility is referred to 'as some place in England' with response to the early detection of a Nuclear strike by 2 radar facilities. * RAF Fylingdales can be seen on earlier episodes of the 1960's set ITV Drama Heartbeat, filmed in the village of Goathland just a few miles away.

In Smith, William (ed.). Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. 3. p. 516-517. Life He was a native of Phlius in Peloponnese, and was therefore by birth a Dorian. His father's name was Pyrrhonides or Encomius. It is not known at what time he went to Athens, but we find him exhibiting there, in competition with Choerilus and Aeschylus, around the 70th Olympiad, that is, 500-499 BCE, the year of Aeschylus's debut.Suda, Αἰσχύλος, Πρατίνας Works The main innovation that ancient critics ascribed to Pratinas was the separation of the satyric from the tragic drama.Suda, πρῶτος ἔγραψε ΣατύρουςHelenius Acron, Commentaries on Horace 230, reading Pratinae for Cratini Pratinas is frequently credited as having introduced satyr plays as a species of entertainment distinct from tragedy, in which the rustic merry-makings and the extravagant dances of the satyrs were retained. The change preserved a highly characteristic feature of the older form of tragedy, the entire rejection of which would have met with serious obstacles, not only from the popular taste, but from religious associations, and yet preserved it in such a manner as, while developing its own capabilities, to set free the tragic drama from certain of its genre constraints. A band of Satyrs, as the companions of Dionysus, formed the original chorus of tragedy; and their jests and frolics were interspersed with the more serious action of the drama, without causing any more sense of incongruity than is felt in the reading of those humorous passages of Homer, from which Aristotle traces the origin of the satyric drama and of comedy. As however tragedy came to be separated more and more from any reference to Dionysus, and the whole of the heroic mythology was included in its range of subjects, the chorus of Satyrs came to be seen as impracticable and absurd, and at the same time the humorous element, which formed an essential part of the character of the chorus of Satyrs, became more and more incongruous with the earnest spirit of the higher tragic dramas. It is easy to enter into the fun of the Prometheus the Fire-kindler, where an old Satyr singes his beard in attempting to embrace the beautiful fire; but it is hard to fancy what the poet could have done with a chorus of Satyrs, in place of the ocean nymphs, in the Prometheus Bound. The innovation of Pratinas at once relieved tragedy of this problem, and gave the Satyrs a free stage for themselves; where, by treating the same class of subjects on which the tragedies were founded, in a totally different spirit, the poet not only preserved a popular feature of his art (the old chorus), but also presented stories that audiences found, for lack of a better word, fun. It has been suggested by some writers that Pratinas cultivated the satyric drama out of fear of being eclipsed by Aeschylus in tragedy. Others disagree and observe that the early life of Pratinas would very probably imbue him with a taste for that kind of the drama; for his native city, Phlius, was the neighbor of Sicyon, the home of those \\"tragic choruses\\", on the strength of which the Dorians claimed to be the inventors of tragedy. It was adjacent also to Corinth, where the cyclic choruses of Satyrs, which were ascribed to Arion, had been long established.Herodotus, Histories 5.67Themistius, Orations xix.Aristotle, Poetics 3Bentley, Phal Reputation This innovation of Pratinas was adopted by his contemporaries; but Pratinas is distinguished by the large proportion of his satyric dramas. He composed, according to the Suda, fifty plays, of which thirty-two were Satyr plays. Böckh, however, from an alternate reading of the Suda, assigns to Pratinas only twelve satyric dramas, thus leaving a sufficient number of tragedies to make three for every satyric drama, that is, twelve tetralogies and two single plays.Trag. Gr. Princ. p. 125 In merit, the satyric dramas of Pratinas were considered the best ever written by his contemporaries, except only those of Aeschylus.Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.13.16 Pratinas ranked high among the lyric, as well as the dramatic poets of his age. He also wrote dithyrambs and the choral odes called hyporchemata, and a considerable fragment of one of these is preserved in Athenaeus.Athenaeus, xiv. 617 Hyporcheme was closely related to the satyric drama by the humorous character which it often assumed, and dithyrambs by its ancient choruses of Satyrs. Pratinas may perhaps be considered to have shared with his contemporary Lasus of Hermione the honor of founding the Athenian school of dithyrambic poetry. Some interesting fragments of his hyporchemes are preserved, especially a considerable passage in Athenaeus which gives an important indication of the contest for supremacy which was then going on both between poetry and music, and between the different kinds of music. The poet complains that the voices of the singers were overpowered by the noise of the flutes, and expresses his desire to replace the prevailing Phrygian scales then commonly used with the Dorian. It is impossible to say how much of his lyric poetry was separate from his dramas; in which, both from the age at which he lived, and from express testimony, we know that great importance was assigned not only to the songs, but also to the dances of the chorus. Athenaeus mentions him as one of the poets who were called \\"orchestikoi\\" (ὀρχηστικοί), from the large part which the choral dances bore in their dramas.Isaac Casaubon, De Satyrica Graecorum & Romanorum Satira (1605), Paris, lib. 1. c.5Näke, Choeril. p. 12Karl Otfried Müller, Die Dorier (1824), vol. ii. pp. 334, 361, 362, 2nd ed., Gesch. d.

It originally billed itself as \\"The World's Only Daily Game Magazine\\". The page was launched on 1 January 1993 on page 370 of the Teletext service on ITV before transferring over to Channel 4 later that year. It was updated daily except on Sundays, apart from a nine-month period in 2002 when it went to three days a week, weekends and holidays. It was followed by up to 1.5 million viewers at times. The magazine was notable for its surreal and risqué humour as well as its games coverage. Digitiser was advertised on the back of multiple issues of the multi-platform video game magazine Electric Brain. Digitiser was created by writers Paul Rose and Tim Moore who went by the pseudonyms Mr Biffo and Mr Hairs. They wrote it together for the first four years while Rose wrote more or less solo for the remaining six in a freelance capacity. History Digitiser frequently courted controversy, inspiring criticism both from outside groups and Teletext's own editorial team, who viewed the writers as troublemakers but were unable to axe them due to the magazine's popularity. Pages were often altered without the writers' knowledge, with sub-editors sometimes deleting entire frames of reviews for fear of missing a risqué joke. On one occasion, a sub-editor, who shortly afterwards was promoted to editorial director of the company, rang Rose to insist he remove a \\"disgusting\\" reference to \\"fingering the index\\". When Rose pointed out that it was a play on \\"index finger\\", and that it had not even dawned on him that it might be considered rude, the up-and-coming sub-editor is alleged to have fallen silent for a few seconds, before insisting that it was still deliberately provocative, and should be deleted. A similar confrontation occurred over a reference to \\"The three Rs\\", during which sub- editors believed that - despite Biffo's amused protests to the contrary - the \\"Rs\\" part of the phrase was meant to sound a bit like \\"arse\\", rather than a reference to the famous educational principle. Campaigns were even waged to have Digitiser's writing team fired - both within Teletext by its editorial minions, and beyond (by disgruntled Amiga, Sega, Sony, or Nintendo fans, not to mention the staff of Mean Machines and Official Nintendo magazines - whom Digitiser frequently poked fun at). Such reactions merely served to redouble Biffo's resolve to be controversial and edgy, and as he often wrote on the letters pages, Digitiser \\"hates everyone equally, man\\". For every person who hated Digitiser, there were dozens more who loved it, both for its fair and unbiased judgements of games, its informed style, and its unique and often bizarre tone. Doubtless, Biffo's battles with his employers helped to give Digitiser a defiant, anti-establishment air. Things finally came to a head in 2002, when Teletext gained a new senior editorial team, who lost patience with Biffo's pushing of the envelope of what was acceptable on a mainstream text service. Even though they could not quite bring themselves to get rid of Digitiser and Biffo altogether, they ordered that the magazine be reduced to three days a week, and have all humour and character stripped from the pages. Despite massive evidence to the contrary, and being one of the most popular features sections on Teletext, Biffo has said since that he was told the reason for this was because the humour \\"excluded people\\". Another reason for the reduction to three days a week, and the removal of the Panel 4 feature at weekends, was the negative financial effects felt after the September 11 attacks on Teletext Ltd.'s core business of advertising air travel holidays. It seemed as if the \\"suits\\" had finally won, and with Biffo's screenwriting career taking off at the time, he could have chosen to walk away from it all. However, he chose to stay on, writing the pages anonymously, as it only took 45 minutes out of his working day. \\"Money for old rope,\\" he has said subsequently. The decision later backfired on Teletext, when Digitiser's viewing figures plummeted to 400,000 per day from its peak of 1.5 million, and viewers spent the next nine months inundating the company with letters of complaint, demanding that Digitiser's humour and characters be restored. After thousands of emails and letters had poured into Teletext they were forced to go back on their previous decision, and asked Biffo to reinstate the humour, and return Digitiser to its daily glory. However, for Biffo the damage had been done, and his last shreds of faith in the company had been shattered. After Biffo handed in his notice in December 2002, he returned Digitiser to its earlier style for one final, four-month run as a thank you to the fans - which included a special ten-year anniversary celebration, complete with a glowing eulogy by author Alex Garland. The lights finally went out on just over ten years of Digitiser on 9 March 2003. Digitiser was replaced by GameCentral, which featured the same number of sub-pages, but none of the humour with then editor Tony Mott explaining \\"We're not Digitiser so get over it\\" to readers on the first edition. The writers The founding writers of Digitiser were Mr Biffo (Paul Rose) and Mr Hairs (Tim Moore) who, as Biffo himself says, only began working on it in order to \\"amuse ourselves and get free games\\". Hairs was fired by Teletext in May 1996, and Biffo continued to write the bulk of the magazine solo, apart for occasional, part-time contributors, who helped him out with the letters, tips, and charts pages. These temporary assistants went by the names Mr Cheese, Mr Udders and Mr Toast. Digitiser also ran a weekly opinion column, written by various guest writers, usually prominent members of the games journalist community (such as Violet Berlin and Stuart Campbell). Recent news In their 10 December 2006 episode, videoGaiden inducted Digitiser into their videoGaiden Time Capsule with the aid of Colin Baker in his outlandish Doctor Who outfit, and the song Lavender by Rose's favourite band, Marillion. Regular characters Regular characters appeared on the service both to fill up space left by short reviews and letters, and also to flesh out the content provided by the writers. The Man With a Long Chin (later renamed The Man) - The Man kept a regular diary in which he would detail the job he had been doing that week, before (usually) getting fired at the end of the week. One of The Man's jobs saw him working in a burger bar. He was eventually fired when he replaced the toilet paper with gloves from the lost property box, and someone froze to death in the toilet. The Man's Daddy (later renamed Daddy) - a bizarre ant/elephant creature who declared himself to be a famous comedian. His jokes tended to be disjointed, usually relying on a nonsense answer or a far-fetched pun. His jokes included: Question. Why did Superman wear his pants outside his trousers? Answer. Because he was a pervert., Question.: What do you call a dog wearing a policeman's hat? Answer: PC Dog-hat and Question.: What do you say if there is a seed in your pie and a man in your yard? Answer: \\"Seed pie leave now\\". Mr. T - A take on Mr. T from The A-Team, who would dispense worldly advice, while warning kids to stay away from his bins. His distinctive vocal style was brought across by the use of capitalisation of entire words in a sentence. Phoning Honey - Would phone up stores in order to make prank calls, and present the transcript for readers' perusal. Fat Sow - Presented the news page, and began every article with a wild insult, and a demand that the reader stop whatever they are doing to pay attention to the rant. Rose allegedly received a written warning when Teletext's editors deemed Fat Sow's comment \\"What's the matter lads - too fat and stupid to get into the army?\\" as \\"Grossly offensive towards security guards\\". Zombie Dave - A reanimated corpse who appeared on the news page and punctuated the items with comments written in the manner of the shambling dead. This was frequently used as an excuse to get rude comments screened on the family-friendly service, such as when he described Tomb Raider's Lara Croft as \\"thrr brrrd wrrz thrr tttrrrdz\\". Insincere Dave - A send-up of fanboys, marketing staff and ultra-positive reviewers; in particular the over enthusiastic Dave Gibbons who at that time was the games reviewer for the BBC Ceefax service. Dave would comment briefly on the news items of the day in an overly optimistic and enthusiastic fashion. Famously, any spare space on the line his comments occupied would be filled with exclamation marks, further emphasising his \\"sincerity.\\" Example: on a story about a pink casing accessory for the Dreamcast, Dave commented that, \\"Now your DC can be in the pink!!!!!!!\\". Very occasionally, a more deadpan Dave would appear: on a story regarding Microsoft's intention to ensure that the Xbox marketing budget outweighed Sony's PS2 expenditure, Dave remarked that, \\"Money is the most important thing.\\" Dave's comments were usually preceded by a rather acid take on the day's gaming events, adding a further element of juxtaposition to Dave's enthusiasm. The Snakes - A pair of beatboxing snakes, which would argue in a manner similar to that of Ali G (but pre-dating him by some years). Led to the catchphrase \\"I Cuss You Bad\\", along with the use of the word \\"Skank\\".Snake City BW - A faceless quizmaster, who was a bizarre parody of Bamber Boozler, quizmaster of Teletext quiz Bamboozle, often appearing to be nude. Gossi the Dog - Perhaps Digitisers most controversial character, Gossi hosted a regular gaming gossip page. On one occasion, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint about the Gossi page, which alluded to Gossi's master thrashing the talking cartoon dog with a belt. Gossi's page also led to the dismissal of Tim Moore, who - while Rose was away on paternity leave - printed an unsubstantiated rumour about a fellow games journalist Dave Perry. Teletext's editors allegedly used the absence of Rose (who remained useful to the company for his graphic design abilities), and the journalist's complaint, as an excuse to fire Moore. Doctor Derek Doctors - A sinister megalomaniac, whom Biffo and Hairs secretly removed from air, after a concerned mother rang to say she found him \\"Perverted and disgusting\\". Chester Fisho - Chester gave views on the news of the day laced with masses of sexual innuendo. Mock advertisements During Teletext's 16-year run, many of its subpages would have adverts inserted on the last page. Digitiser decided to create their own spoof adverts as a result. One of the most notable was for a fictional German music compilation called Rock Meister!, which included stereotypical German words as in \\"Rock dir night mit ROCK MEISTER!!\\", instead of the official \\"Rock der nacht!\\" as the advertisement was poking fun of stereotypes made at the German language, alongside stating the compilation is \\"Musik fur dir LONGHAIRS!\\". Artists on the compilation were listed as Roxette (although they came from Sweden) and The Scorpions, while \\"NOT A REAL GERMAN ADVERT\\" was placed at the top left of the screen instead of the usual \\"NOT AN ADVERT\\". This was done as a viewer contacted Teletext over a previous spoof believing it to be real. Reveal button The reveal button was a feature that was made heavy use of on Digitiser. Pressing this key on your television remote made some previously hidden text appear, sometimes with a blinking effect. Typical jokes would tell you to press reveal to see what a certain character thought of your letter, or a news item, and you would be presented with a surreal non-sequitur, such as a man shouting \\"Swayze!\\" The weekend edition would often feature a full-length \\"story,\\" told through \\"Reveal-O\\"s (as they were often called - see \\"Digi- Speak\\") on every page. The most controversial \\"Reveal-O\\" appeared right at the end of Digitisers life, on the final page of the final letters section. It purported to be a picture of \\"the real Turner The Worm (a cartoon character from Teletext also created by RoseA Turner the Worm comic) being sick\\". Pressing the reveal button then uncovered an image that many have likened to a recently ejaculated penis. The end-of-year quiz featured lizard like creatures pointing to the correct answer with its tongue when the button was pressed. Digi-Speak A further element of Digitisers other-worldly charm was its unusual take on the English language. Often this amounted to little more than using \\"the\\" in unusual places or adding curious suffixes to existing words (including, but not limited to -uss, -O, -ston, -Oh! and -me-do), but occasionally invented whole new sounds using words that never been used in that context, such as \\"huss\\" becoming an exclamation of joy. Another very common Digitiser phrase was the expression \\"mess up\\". It was used to mean erring or failing, to rebuke or discredit a person's opinion (\\"You, sir, have messed up.\\"), as an adjective meaning substandard or faulty (\\"messed-up animation\\"), and as a noun meaning any negative thing (\\"there are several mess-ups\\"). The phrase, like many others, was embraced by the readers who often used it in their letters. The author Alex Garland was a Digitiser fan and named a chapter in his novel The Beach \\"Messed Up\\" in its honour. Using tramps as similes (\\"That's like putting lipstick on a dead tramp and calling it a supermodel\\"), the phrase moc-moc-a-moc and irrelevant sentences which read merely \\"And!\\" were all elements of the Digitiser lexicon. It was common practice for Digitiser to mock the names of contributors to its letters page. Generally, the more obvious the better (for example a reader with the surname \\"Major\\" could well find themselves being referred to as \\"John\\"). Notable bits of name-calling included Digitiser viewer Matt Gander being rechristened \\"non- shiny goose\\", and a Mr. Tedesco being called \\"Safedeway\\", alluding to supermarket chains Tesco and Safeway. Bubblegun.com Bubblegun.com is a website that was established by Paul Rose, and featured contributions from several other writers. Touting itself as a Pop Culture version of Digitiser, this site gained popularity around the last few years of Digitiser, being named by Select magazine as one of the UK's top 10 \\"maverick websites\\". Though Paul Rose has not written for the site in over a decade, it remains as an archive run by its former designer, Steve Horsley. Though remaining unaffiliated with Rose - who has distanced himself from it - Bubblegun has featured new material from all-new contributors. Digitiser 2000 In late 2014, Digitiser received an online revival of sorts with the launch of Digitiser2000.com, a website featuring a mixture of games news and reviews, articles and humour, in the traditional Digitiser offbeat style, and featuring many of the characters and features previously seen in the Teletext era of Digi. The content for the new site is largely written by Paul \\"Mr Biffo\\" Rose and was essentially self-funded at launch; Rose has since enabled a crowdfunding page through Patreon to enable readers to contribute towards the site's running costs (though the site's core content will remain freely available for all to view). Mr Biffo's Found Footage In 2017, Paul Rose successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign to bring together \\"Mr Biffo's Found Footage\\", a comedy/sci-fi montage series in the found footage style. The full series was released for free on YouTube weekly each Sunday, beginning on 10 September 2017 and ending on 22 October 2017. Digitiser The Show In 2018, a second Kickstarter campaign by Paul Rose was funded - over 1000 backers raised more than £44000 to create Digitiser The Show, a weekly six-part YouTube show featuring regular co-hosts Mr Biffo, Larry Bundy Jr, Octavius Kitten, Gameplay Jenny and Paul Gannon, and special guests from across the gaming community. Episodes also included appearances by various Teletext Digitiser characters in acted or puppet form, and the original Mr Hairs. .

In his works he classified plants according to their fruits and seeds, rather than alphabetically or by medicinal properties. In 1555, he succeeded Luca Ghini as director of the botanical garden in Pisa. The botanist Pietro Castelli was one of his students. Cesalpino also did limited work in the field of physiology. He theorized a circulation of the blood. However, he envisioned a \\"chemical circulation\\" consisting of repeated evaporation and condensation of blood, rather than the concept of \\"physical circulation\\" popularized by the writings of William Harvey (1578–1657).  Biography  Statue of Cesalpino among the gallery of famous Tuscans in the Loggiato of the Uffizi, sculpted by Pio Fedi Cesalpino was born in Arezzo, Tuscany. For his studies at the University of Pisa his instructor in medicine was R. Colombo (d. 1559), and in botany the celebrated Luca Ghini. After completing his course he taught philosophy, medicine, and botany for many years at the same university, besides making botanical explorations in various parts of Italy. At this time the first botanical gardens in Europe were laid out; the earliest at Padua, in 1546; the next at Pisa in 1547 by Ghini, who was its first director. Ghini was succeeded by Cesalpino, who had charge of the Pisan garden 1554–1558. When far advanced in years Cesalpino accepted a call to Rome as professor of medicine at University of Rome La Sapienza and physician to Pope Clement VIII. It is not positively certain whether he also became the chief superintendent of the Roman botanical garden which had been laid out about 1566 by one of his most celebrated pupils, Michele Mercati.  Philosophical works  All of Cesalpino's writings show the man of genius and the profound thinker. His style, it is true, is often heavy, yet in spite of the scholastic form in which his works are cast, passages of great beauty often occur. Modern botanists and physiologists who are not acquainted with the writings of Aristotle find Cesalpino's books obscure; their failure to comprehend them has frequently misled them in their judgment of his achievement. No comprehensive summing up of the results of Cesalpino's investigations, founded on a critical study of all his works has appeared, neither has there been a complete edition of his writings. Seven of these are positively known, and most of the seven have been printed several times, although none have appeared since the 17th century. In the following list the date of publication given is that of the first edition. His most important philosophical work is Quaestionum peripateticarum libri V (1569). Cesalpino proves himself in this to be one of the most eminent and original students of Aristotle in the 16th century. His writings, however, show traces of the influence of Averroes, hence he is an Averroistic Aristotelean; apparently he was also inclined to pantheism, consequently he was included, later, in the Spinozists before Spinoza. A Protestant opponent of Aristotelean views, Nicolaus Taurellus wrote several times against Cesalpino. The work of Taurellus entitled Alpes cæsae, etc. (1597), is entirely devoted to combating the opinions of Cesalpino, as the play on the name Cæsalpinus shows. Nearly one hundred years later Cesalpino's views were again attacked by Samuel Parker, in a work entitled Disputationes de Deo et providentia divina (1678). Cesalpino repeatedly asserted the steadfastness of his Catholic principles and his readiness to acknowledge the falsity of any philosophical opinions expounded by him as Aristotelean doctrine, which should be contrary to revelation. In Italy he was in high favour both with the secular and spiritual rulers.  Medical and physiological works  Cesalpino's physiological investigations concerning the circulation of the blood are well known, but even up to the present time they have been as often overestimated as undervalued. An examination of the various passages in his writings which bear upon the question shows that although it must be said that Cesalpino had penetrated further into the secret of circulation of the blood than any other physiologist before William Harvey, still he had not attained a thorough knowledge, founded on anatomical research, of the entire course of the blood. Besides the work Quæstionum peripateticarum already mentioned, reference should be made to Quaestionum medicarum libri duo (1593).  Botanical works  His most important publication was De plantis libri XVI (1583). The date of its publication, 1583, is one of the most important in the history of botany before Carl Linnaeus. The work is dedicated to the Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici. Unlike the \\"herbals\\" of that period, it contains no illustrations. The first section, including thirty pages of the work, is the part of most importance for botany in general. From the beginning of the 17th century up to the present day botanists have agreed in the opinion that Cesalpino in this work, in which he took Aristotle for his guide, laid the foundation of the morphology and physiology of plants and produced the first scientific classification of flowering plants. Three things, above all, give the book the stamp of individuality: the large number of original, acute observations, especially on flowers, fruits, and seeds, made, moreover, before the invention of the microscope, the selection of the organs of fructification for the foundation of his botanical system; finally, the ingenious and at the same time strictly philosophical handling of the rich material gathered by observation. Cesalpino issued a publication supplementary to this work, entitled Appendix ad libros de plantis et quaestiones peripateticas (1603). Cesalpino is also famous in the history of botany as one of the first botanists to make an herbarium; one of the oldest herbaria still in existence is that which he arranged about 1550–60 for Bishop Alfonso Tornabono. After many changes of fortune the herbarium is now in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze at Florence. It consists of 260 folio pages arranged in three volumes bound in red leather, and contains 768 species of plants. A work of some value for chemistry, mineralogy, and geology was issued by him under the title De metallicis libri tres (Rome, 1596). Some of its matter recalls the discoveries made at the end of the eighteenth century, as those of Antoine Lavoisier and René Just Haüy, it also shows a correct understanding of fossils. The Franciscan friar Charles Plumier gave the name of Cæsalpinia to a plant genus and Linnaeus retained it in his system. At the present day this genus includes approximately 150 species and belongs family Fabaceae, subfamily Cæsalpinioideae, which contains a large number of useful plants. Linnaeus in his writings often quotes his great predecessor in the science of botany and praises Cesalpino in the following lines: Quisquis hic exstiterit primos concedat honores Casalpine Tibi primaque certa dabit.  Geology  As mentioned above, De metallicis libri tres (Rome, 1596) was of value for mineralogy and geology, displaying a correct understanding of fossils. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology states that in 1596, > Cesalpino, a celebrated botanist, conceived that fossil shells had been left > on the land by the sea, and had concreted into stone during the > consolidation of the soil.\\"Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, 1832, pp. > 30  Sources   External links  * Some places and memories related to Andrea Cesalpino on Himetop – The History of Medicine Topographical Database * De plantis, 1583, on Google Books. * De metallicis, 1596, on Google Books. * De Metallicis Libri Tres – full digital facsimile at Linda Hall Library * Category:1519 births Category:1603 deaths Category:16th-century Latin-language writers Category:17th-century Latin-language writers Category:Italian botanists Category:Italian philosophers Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:16th-century Italian physicians Category:17th-century Italian physicians Category:People from Arezzo Category:Pre-Linnaean botanists Category:Sapienza University of Rome faculty Category:University of Pisa faculty ","title":"Andrea Cesalpino"},{"id":"895170","text":"was a statesman and diplomat, active in Meiji period Japan.

Biography Ghini was born in Casalfiumanese, son of a notary, and studied medicine at the University of Bologna. By 1527 he was lecturing there on medicinal plants, and eventually became a professor. He moved to Pisa in 1544, while maintaining his home in Bologna. He created the first herbarium (hortus siccus) in that year, drying plants while pressing them between pieces of paper, then gluing them to cardboard. None of his herbaria survive although the one by his student Gherardo Cibo made around 1532 survives. 1544 also saw the establishment of a garden for live plants, which became known as the Orto botanico di Pisa. Ghini published no significant botanical work of his own, but was noted as a teacher many of whose students went on to significant careers, including Cesalpino (his successor at the herbariuim) and Pietro Andrea Mattioli, the latter of which he helped by travelling around the Mediterranean and Near East in search for plants that matched the mystifying descriptions of Dioscorides.

As a student, Wohlforth joined the youth section of Max Shachtman's Independent Socialist League (ISL), the Socialist Youth League in 1953.Jim Higgins, The Prophet's Children (1995), Revolutionary History, Vol. 6 No. 1, Winter 1995/96. (accessed 2008-08-15) He broke with Shachtman in 1957 when the ISL moved rightward to merge with the Socialist Party of America. Later that year, Wohlforth and a minority of ISL members joined the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), which was the main Trotskyist group in the US at the time.Harry Ratner, \\"Review of The Prophet's Children\\", New Interventions, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1996 (accessed 2008-08-15). In the early 1960s when the SWP and its supporters internationally in the International Committee of the Fourth International fused with the International Secretariat of the Fourth International and developed a critical but generally supportive attitude towards the Cuban Revolution, a minority of members led by Wohlforth and James Robertson (another former ISL member) formed the Revolutionary Tendency within the SWP. While Robertson left the SWP in 1962 and went on to form the Spartacist Group, later Spartacist League, Wohlforth and his supporters remained within the SWP and fought for the perspective of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). They were expelled in 1964 after demanding a discussion of the significance of the Sri Lankan Lanka Sama Samaja Party's entry into the government of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The US supporters of the ICFI formed the American Committee of the Fourth International, and in 1966 they formed the Workers League. In 1974, the ICFI discovered that Wohforth's partner, Nancy Fields, an active member of the Workers League, was raised by a relative who had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency's computer division and had ties to top-ranking agency officials. The Workers League Political Committee and ICFI criticized the fact that neither Fields nor Wohlforth had revealed this to the League. In August 1974, the League's central committee suspended Fields from membership and removed Wohlforth as national secretary pending a commission of inquiry, in a unanimous vote that included Wohlforth's. Both left the League, and Wohlforth rejoined the SWP. An investigation conducted by the Workers League concluded that Fields did not have connections to the CIA, and the two were requested to resume their membership. However, they refused.David North, The Heritage We Defend, Detroit, 1988. Wohlforth later claimed that the Workers League became a cult, largely due to the domination and manipulations of the principal ICFI leader at the time, Gerry Healy. Wohlforth was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In 1994 he published his memoirs, The Prophet's Children.

The railroad originally connected Arcade with Attica, however the right of way from North Java north to Attica was abandoned in 1947 due to flooding on the Tonawanda Creek. The principal business of the ARA is handling agricultural products (soy beans, corn, and fertilizer), lumber, dairy feed, and other commodities between Arcade and North Java. ARA continues to use its GE 80-ton centercab switcher no. 113 as primary freight power, and often will double-head 113 with its GE 65-tonner no. 112 to make switching operations easier at both ends of the line. The freight service operates as needed. The ARA also runs passenger excursion trains from May to October on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Passengers can enjoy a ride from Arcade to Curriers Station in Chaffee, New York, and back on restored 1920s-era Boonton passenger coaches, and an open gondola, pulled by the historic Arcade & Attica 18 (currently undergoing a full rebuild) or 1940s- and '50s-era diesel engines. History The Arcade and Attica Railroad was the latest in a long succession of railroads planned and built through the Tonawanda Valley in Wyoming County. In 1836 the Attica and Sheldon Railroad was proposed, but no construction ever took place. In 1852 the Attica and Alleghany Valley Railroad was incorporated to build a narrow gauge railway from Attica, through Arcade, to the Pennsylvania state line. in 1853 the contract was let for construction and most of the road was graded between Attica and Arcade. In 1855 construction was discontinued and the property was sold at foreclosure on February 2, 1856. On February 28, 1870, the Attica and Arcade Railroad was organized and began purchasing the right of way with construction of the line scheduled for completion by October 1, 1876. The railroad went bankrupt in 1873 without ever completing the railroad. On April 5, 1880, the Tonawanda Valley Railroad was incorporated with major financial backing from the Erie Railroad. The company planned to build a , narrow gauge line from Attica, through Curriers Corners, to Sardinia to connect with the Buffalo, New York, and Pennsylvania Railroad. On September 11, 1880, the first train ran on the line from Attica to Curriers Corners. In October 1880 the Tonawanda Valley Extension Railroad was organized to extend the line from Curriers to Sardinia. By that winter the company changed its mind and began building to Arcade, rather than Sardinia. By May 1, 1881, the line had reached Arcade. On July 14, 1881, the Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad was formed to extend the line from Arcade to Cuba via Sandusky and Rushford. On August 27, 1881, the Tonawanda Valley Railroad, Tonawanda Valley Extension Railroad, and Tonawanda Valley and Cuba were merged into the new Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad. By September 4, 1882, the line was complete between Attica and Cuba. The Company built facilities to transfer to the standard-gauge Erie Railroad in Attica and Cuba. In Cuba, the company made a connection with the Bradford, Eldred and Cuba, another narrow-gauge railroad controlled by the Erie.Arcade & Attica Railroad (2009) Kenneth C. Springirth Fonthill Media By September 1884 the company was defaulting on its bonds and November 29 the company was in receivership. The company's fortunes fell further when the Bradford, Eldred and Cuba went bankrupt. The company limped along until October 30, 1886, when it stopped its service from Cuba to Sandusky. On January 19, 1891, the section from Attica to Freedom was sold to bondholders and in May of that year the Attica and Freedom Railroad was formed. The line went bankrupt and was sold in April 1894. On October 13, 1894, the Buffalo, Attica and Arcade Railroad was formed to operate the line. The new management switched the line to standard gauge and by January 1895 the Attica to Curriers section was operating again. By December of that year the line was open and running from Attica to Arcade. By December 1897 the company had laid a segment to connect with the Pennsylvania Railroad near Arcade. By January 1902 the company had built a line from Arcade to Sandusky with the ultimate goal of reaching Crystal Lake, Illinois. In August that same year, a flood washed out much of the line between Arcade and Sandusky along with the connection to the Pennsylvania RR. In 1904 the BA&A; was sold to the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad which connected the BA&A; in Arcade. The B&S; operated the line until 1913 when it was sold to W. L. Kann of Pittsburgh. Under Kann the railroad declined and lost money until operations were suspended in the winter of 1916/17. On May 23, 1917, the Arcade and Attica (A&A;) Railroad was formed by local investors to operate the line. The line had its ups and downs, but survived. It had the enviable distinction of not laying off a single employee during the Great Depression. In 1941 the company purchased a 44-ton diesel from General Electric. The diesel was more dependable and much less expensive to operate than the steam locomotives. Many people credit the diesel for preventing the A&A; from going bankrupt in 1941. The Arcade and Attica operated a passenger service until 1951 when the Erie stopped providing a service on the Buffalo- Hornell line, including the connection with the A&A; in Attica. In 1957 the line was abandoned between Attica and North Java because of severe washouts in the spring of that year. During the 1960s the Arcade & Attica struck its mark when Borden's debuted the non-dairy creamer 'Cremora'. Until the facility's closure in 1970 the Arcade facility was the sole production plant in the United States for Cremora. The Arcade & Attica railroad brought in the raw supplies and shipped out the finished product across America. The famous orange & white boxcars, and later blue & white ones, were used to ship product throughout the country. On Saturday, May 27, 2017, the railroad held a celebration marking the corporation's 100th Anniversary. Part of the festivities included the first time in history that steam locomotive No.18 was turned on the wye to face railroad south. Until this weekend, it has always faced north. Other festivities included speeches at the station, employee photographs, a ribbon cutting ceremony, and a cake cutting at the Curriers Depot. Excursion line The passenger cars of the Arcade & Attica. Railroad freight traffic started to decline due to the inroads being made by the automobile and trucking industries following World War II and the Arcade & Attica wasn't immune. A solution was to purchase a light steam locomotive and a couple of passenger coaches for a tourist excursion service. After a few years of searching, A&A; management purchased a 2-8-0 #18 from the Boyne City Railroad in Michigan and two commuter coaches from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. For 27 days, the A&A; offered passenger excursions in 1962. The following year, #14, a 4-6-0, was purchased from the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad and more coaches were added. Now the Arcade and Attica runs all 6 coaches per run with an open air gondola used from United States Air Force Locomotive roster Arcade & Attica #18. *Arcade & Attica 14: (4-6-0) - Built in February 1917 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; currently in storage as it requires a very expensive overhaul to comply with federal safety standards *Arcade & Attica 18: (2-8-0) - Built in 1920 American Locomotive Company at its 'Cooke Works' in Paterson, New Jersey.Picture of A&A; 18 Currently out of service undergoing a full rebuild in Syracuse, NY. *Arcade & Attica 110: (GE 44-ton switcher) - Built in 1941 by General Electric at its Erie, Pennsylvania, plant, #110 is considered to have 'dieselized' the A&A; single-handedly; now on static display in the municipal parking lot across Main Street from the Arcade station.

He belonged to the comital branch of the Tolstoy family. Tolstoy graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in 1843. He held a managing position at the Ministry of the Navy beginning in 1853. Tolstoy was an Ober- Procurator of the Holy Synod in 1865-1880, simultaneously holding a post of the Minister of National Enlightenment in 1866-1880\\\\. In 1871, Tolstoy was in charge of the college reform, which would result in the prevalence of the classical education (included Latin and Greek languages and ancient literature, among other things). In 1872, as Education minister, Tolstoy agreed to the opening by V. I. Guerrier of his Higher Women's Courses in Moscow, thus establishing higher education for women in Russia. In 1882-1889, Tolstoy was the Interior Minister and Chief of Gendarmerie. He is considered one of the pillars of the political reaction in the 1880s and supporter of the strong authority. Tolstoy's activities were aimed at backing the nobility, regulating peasantry's modus vivendi and spreading his administration's influence over local authorities. On Tolstoy's initiative, they issued the so- called \\"Temporary regulations\\" in 1882, which limited the freedom of press to an even greater extent. Tolstoy, together with A. Pazukhin, outlined and prepared the so-called \\"counterreforms\\", which would become very unpopular in Russia. As one of the great counter reformers of the post Crimean period Tolstoy used his position as minister of education to promote study at university and secondary levels that would bolster Russia as a nation with honest people in power looking to maintain Orthodoxy and Autocracy: something in danger during Tolstoy's rule as the post Crimean period of reform amounted also to increasing rebellion and student dissent. Tolstoy did his best to educate a Russia, and moreover a Russian elite that would maintain Orthodoxy and Autocracy while being in mountable competition with the West. His focus was on consolidating his power over education while suppressing revolutionary attitudes by just censorship, etc. Tolstoy was elected President of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1882. He wrote a number of books on Russian history.

She is a mutant prostitute who was briefly affiliated with the X-Men and was later known as a member of the New Warriors. Created by writer by Joe Casey and artist Tom Raney, she first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #399 (November 2001), when she was known as X-Stacy. She later became known as Ripcord. Fictional character biography Stacy-X first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #399 (November 2001). Her real name is Miranda Leevald, and she has the mutant ability to exude pheromones which she could control to stimulate bodily sensations and functions of others, such as causing orgasms or vomiting. Her mutation also had a physical manifestation: at the age of sixteen Stacy's skin was replaced by patterned, snake-like scales. At one point her skin was shown shedding, much like a real snake's.Uncanny X-Men #399. Marvel Comics She later became known as Stacy-X.Uncanny X-Men #403. Marvel Comics She first appeared as a member of the Nevada mutant brothel, the X-Ranch. After the hate group the Church of Humanity destroys the ranch, Stacy joins the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She plays a vital role in fighting Black Tom, using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper workout. Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past.Uncanny X-Men #402–413. Marvel Comics Soon after the events at the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute. She took some time off after \\"servicing\\" a special client in Chappaqua, New York. Wolverine tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but he did talk Nightcrawler out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to \\"work\\" for special clients even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members Archangel and Nightcrawler. She became a team member who was highly depended upon. At one point when Chamber and Nightcrawler were stranded in the mountains, Chamber telepathically communicated with Stacy X. While she brought help, she was upset that Chamber invaded her mind without permission until Chamber told her she was the only one he thought would believe him as his telepathic powers were still new.Uncanny X-Men #417. Marvel Comics> At one point, Miranda works with a food magnate who is very sick. He reveals himself as a mutant with debilitating mutations: advanced aging has made him old before his time, and he has developed an immunity to all painkillers. She changes his body chemistry so that he will live out the rest of his short life without pain. After a spat with Paige (alias Husk), caused by the fact that they both were in love with Archangel, Miranda decides to leave the mansion. (She knew about Paige's love as she could see her lust with her ability to see people's emotions through their pheromones.) However, she left behind for Archangel a video of herself jumping rope naked, stating that she did not want to stay around them. Rather, this will indicate to him that he missed the chance to have had someone as sexy as herself as a girlfriend, instead of Paige.Uncanny X-Men #422. Marvel ComicsUncanny X-Men #414. Marvel Comics =Decimation and New Warriors= Due to the Scarlet Witch's magic, Miranda is one of the many mutants to lose her powers after the events of Decimation. While she was a prostitute when she had her powers, she never actually slept with anyone for money, relying on her pheromone powers. Since she lost her powers, this has apparently changed.New Warriors #1–20. Marvel Comics She becomes a member of the reformed New Warriors under the codename Ripcord. The circumstances of how she joined are not completely revealed, but her attitude and statements show that she wanted to change her life, and going back to being a hero seems like the path she chose best to do it. Besides being given artificial powers to replace what she lost, she apparently also has lost her leftover scaled skin.New Warriors vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics She was killed in an accident along with Skybolt.New Warriors vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics =Vengeance= Stacy X mysteriously re-appears in 2011's Vengeance limited series, the official sequel to the 1989/1990 crossover Acts of Vengeance. Stacy is shown having a three-way sexual encounter with Welsh pop star Sugar Kane (Chamber's onetime girlfriend) and new character Ultimate Nullifier in a high-rise hotel room after they are at a nightclub. The trio is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Magneto, who seeks to discipline Stacy for what he considers to be her disgraceful decadence which is embarrassingly tarnishing the collective image of Earth's too few remaining mutants. Magneto proceeds to magnetically thrash the room and toss all of them around. However, Ultimate Nullifier engages in combat with Magneto while Stacy and Sugar Kane make their escape. Successfully subduing Magneto by depowering him with a power-dampening gun and beating him with formidable martial arts skills, Ultimate Nullifier then reveals to Magneto that he was actually secretly acting as a bodyguard to Stacy and that it is his mission to protect her from Magneto.Vengeance #1–6. Marvel Comics Powers and abilities Stacy had snake-like, scaly skin that gave her an unknown degree of durability. She could control other's pheromones through skin contact, producing sensations and physical reactions in anyone she touches. She was able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and increase their stamina by giving her teammates a rush of adrenaline so that they wouldn't easily tire. Stacy is an expert fighter, able to even challenge Wolverine, though she was eventually beaten by him. However, this skill appears to be learned and not mutant in nature. Since joining the New Warriors as Ripcord, she has been given a special armor which has extensible metal tentacles that extend from her wrists and can be used as weapons. She is also equipped with web shooters, frog springs, and a Slyde suit. Other versions Ultimate Stacy X is introduced in Ultimate X-Men as the girlfriend of Mastermind, and she stays with him in the cell where he is currently impersonating Magneto, replacing Mystique (who was doing the same after he escaped during the events of the \\"Magnetic North\\" storyline).Ultimate X-Men #81. Marvel Comics In Ultimate Comics: X-Men she is seen in Camp Angel, camps where mutants are forced to live by the government in the aftermath of the Ultimatum Wave. She considers herself a political prisoner of war and urges mutants into revolution.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #8–9. Marvel Comics Reception Screen Rant ranked Stacy X as one of the superheroes that Marvel wants you to forget, citing her presence in X-Men stories as being based entirely on sex appeal.

Life and career Wadley was born in 1920 in Durban, South Africa. His father was the Mayor of Durban and Trevor was one of 12 children. He attended Durban High School where he excelled in mathematics and science but was uninterested in any sport. The exception was one year when he entered the annual cross-country athletics event and predicted that he would win in record time and his record would stand for 15 years. He went on to do exactly as he had predicted. His training method involved calculating the time he needed to run each section of the course and then training himself to run at the required pace for each section. He then went to Howard College (now the University of KwaZulu-Natal), where he studied under Hugh Clark and Eric Phillips. He had the habit of rarely, if ever, taking notes in lectures due to his near-eidetic memory. GR Bozzoli noted in is book Forging Ahead – South Africa’s Pioneering Engineers that Wadley \\"would very occasionally take out a small pocket notebook and write a word or two in it using a blunt, stubby pencil. His remarkable mind understood and remembered every item of a lecture.” Example of an Ionosonde In 1941, during World War II, he joined the Special Signals Services (SSS) of the South African Corps of Signals which was engaged in developing South Africa's own radar system based on the British experience which had been communicated to them. Wadley and other colleagues including Jules Fejer, the Hungarian-born mathematician, were trained on the British RADAR project. His association with Fejer would continue for many more years. Wadley was not keen on mathematics but Fejer proved each of Wadley's concepts mathematically. In 1946, Wadley was employed as a designer of radio equipment and instrumentation in a special division of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory (TRL), created at the behest of Prime Minister Jan Smuts and located at the electrical engineering department of the University of the Witwatersrand (under Basil Schonland). The TRL relocated to the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and was renamed the National Institute for Telecommunications Research (NITR) (under Dr Frank Hewitt). In 1948, Wadley started working on an urgent project for the South African Chamber of Mines to provide a means of radio communication underground for rescue purposes. After a feasibility investigation Wadley wrote a report indicating that it could be done and detailing his recommendations. The Chamber did not pursue the matter for more than a decade. Wadley retired in 1964 (aged 44) and lived on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal until his death from cancer in 1981 (aged 61).  Ionosonde  At the CSIR he developed a device called an ionosonde for measuring the Earth's ionosphere. It is a specialised form of a radar detector used to measure the height of the ionised layers of air between 50 and 600 kilometers. This information gives insight into what is occurring during an ionospheric storm. The ionosonde was used to provide a transmission frequency prediction service to the SABC, the South African Postal Service (SAPO) and South African Military. Wadley receiver (Barlow Wadley XCR-30)  Wadley loop  It was in 1948 at the CSIR that Wadley invented the Wadley Loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals. The Wadley Loop was first used in the Racal RA-17 a 1950s top-of- the-range British military short wave receiver and later in the South African made, commercially available \\"Barlow-Wadley XCR-30\\" radio. The Wadley Loop is more widely used today in spectrum analysers, where the noise sidebands of the analyser's tunable oscillator are cancelled due to the spectrum analyser having a sideband noise much lower than the signals being measured. This device was even more useful to the SABC, SAPO, the South African Military and British Government agencies. A Wadley receiver (circa 1952) is on display at the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers historical collection in Observatory, Johannesburg. Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain  Tellurometer  In the early 1950s the CSIR was asked to develop a portable measuring device that could measure distances with an accuracy of 1 in 100 000\\\\. In 1954 this project was given to Wadley. He asked Hal Baumann (Rhodes Scholar, engineer and Land Surveyor) for help. Baumann had already invented the tellurometer, but needed finance to develop it. Wadley provided the funding given to him by CSIR, filed the patents under his own name, and took the credit and revenue it generated for himself. https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/bloemfontein/Baumann.html The Tellurmeter could measure up to a distance of 80 km by measuring the time delay in microwave transmissions. It was used in land surveying but has been mostly replaced with laser-based systems. The replacement to the microwave tellurometer was also developed by a South African, H.D. Hölscer. Miniaturised versions are still used in some surveying instruments and mine lift-shafts. One of the first test of the tellurometer involved a measurement of the distance between Brixton Hill in Western Johannesburg and Fort Klapperkop in Pretoria, this being the most accurately known survey baseline in South Africa at the time. It successfully proved the accuracy of the tellurometer but, over time, Wadley noticed a bias to the measurements he was obtaining. He ascribed these to an inaccurate value of the speed of light that had been supplied to him. He approached the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington in England and they agreed to do a new measurement of the speed of light. The new measurement vindicated Wadley's claim. Manhattan In 1958 the Tellurometer was used to measure Manhattan (13.08 miles). The measurement took 1 hour (plus two hours for the technicians to move from the south end of the island to the north.) Previously the measurement had taken 5 days.Official website When the system was demonstrated in England before a group including the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, it showed that a line on the Salisbury Plain which had been used as the baseline for British surveying had been incorrectly calculated by 1.5 meters. Subsequent sales of the device earned more than R300 million (in 1960's terms) in foreign revenue for South Africa. Tellurometers are still manufactured in Plumstead, South Africa.Manufacturer of tellurometers website  Patents  *Distance measuring system.

It specialises in hi-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data and cybersecurity services. Atos operates worldwide under the brands Atos, AtosSyntel, Atos Consulting, Atos Healthcare, Atos Worldgrid, Bull, Canopy and Unify. History A diagram of the history of Atos acquisitions The company was formed in 1997 through a merger of two French IT companies; and combined with the Dutch-based company Origin B.V. in 2000 to become Atos Origin. It subsequently acquired KPMG Consulting in 2002 and SchlumbergerSema in 2004. In 2010 Atos Origin announced the buyout of Siemens IT Solutions and Services and finalized the acquisition in July 2011. Afterwards, the company name reverted to Atos. Logo of Atos Origin used prior to July 2011 = Background: a series of mergers (1997–2011) = In 1996, Origin B.V. was created after a merger of the Dutch company BSO and the Philips C&P; (Communications & Processing) division, while a year later in 1997, Atos was created following a merger of the French companies Axime and Sligos. In 2001, Atos Origin sold its Nordic operations to WM-data. In 2002, it made a major acquisition by buying KPMG Consulting in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. Then in 2004, it acquired SchlumbergerSema, the IT service division of Schlumberger and took over the infrastructure division of ITELLIUM, a subsidiary of KarstadtQuelle. At the same time (2004), the company created a new subsidiary, Atos Worldline, and the renaming of its consulting activities as Atos Consulting. Also in 2004, Atos Origin Australia, originating from Philips, was sold to Fujitsu. In 2005, Atos Origin sold its activities in the Nordic region, which had become part of the company with the acquisition of Sema Group, to WM-data while in 2006, Atos Origin sold its operations in the Middle East to local management. In October 2007, Philippe Germond replaced longtime CEO Bernard Bourigeaud. Two shareholders, the hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Pardus Capital, tried to gain control over the company via the supervisory board. In November 2008, the boardroom battle came to an end when Thierry Breton replaced Philippe Germond as chairman and CEO. In August 2010 Atos Origin acquired Indian payment company Venture Infotek. = Doubling size with acquisition of Siemens IT (2011) = In December 2010 Atos Origin agreed to acquire the IT Solutions and Services subsidiary of Siemens for €850 million. As part of the transaction, Siemens agreed to take a 15% stake in the enlarged Atos, to be held for a minimum of five years. The company dropped the \\"Origin\\" suffix of its name in July 2011 after completing its acquisition of the Siemens unit. In November 2011 Atos and software services provider Ufida International Holdings formed the joint venture Yunano. The two companies invested €5.7 million. Atos has 70 percent and UFIDA has 30 percent. The joint venture has its HQ in Bezons, France, a suburb of Paris. In 2012 Atos announced the creation of a new company called Canopy. The CEO is Philippe Llorens. In 2011 Atos introduced a Zero Email initiative, banning email as a form of internal communications, except for use with customers and prospects. As part of the initiative, Atos acquired the French software company blueKiwi in early 2012, rolling out their ZEN social networking software across its organisation. = Acquisition of information technology pioneer Bull (2014) = In August 2014 Atos announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Bull SA through a tender offer launched in May. Atos announced plans in October 2014 to buy out or squeeze out the remaining share and bondholders of Bull. = Expansion in North American with the acquisition of Xerox ITO and Syntel (2014-2018) = On 19 December 2014 Atos announces the acquisition of Xerox's IT Outsourcing business for , tripling the size of the North American business. At the time of the acquisition, the unit generated (Q3 2014) and had 9,800 employees operating in 45 countries. In October 2018, the company accelerates its expansion in North America with the $3.4-billion acquisition of Syntel, a company with activities in banking, financial services, healthcare, retail and insurance. = Global partnership with Google Cloud, sale of participation in Worldline and acquisition of Maven Wave (2018-2020) = In April 2018, Atos announces a global partnership with Google Cloud to help offer secure artificial intelligence systems. As part of this partnership, the two companies create common offerings and open \\"labs\\" dedicated to artificial intelligence in London, Dallas, Munich and Paris. In 2019, the company divests from Worldline, its payment subsidiary, as part of its strategy to become a \\"digital pure player\\". The company gradually sells its shares, retaining only a 3.82% stake in Worldline in April 2020. On November 1st 2019, Elie Girard replaces Thierry Breton as chief executive officer, following Breton's appointment as EU commissioner. In December 2019, Atos acquires Maven Wave, a US-based Google Cloud Premier Partner specialising in cloud and mobile applications, data analytics, experience design and cloud infrastructure.  Services and Activities  = Global services = Atos activities are organized in four divisions: * Infrastructure & Data Management: Datacenter management, service desk and unified communications; * Business Applications & Platform Solutions: consulting & systems integration; * Big Data & Cybersecurity: production of high-performance computers & servers and cybersecurity; * Worldline: e-commerce payment services and POS terminal application. = Activities = Positioned as a vendor of holistic digital transformation, Atos builds on four pillars within its Digital Transformation Factory:  Cloud  * Cloud_computing: implementation and management of private and hybrid cloud.

United Kingdom  According to a National Audit Office report on the government's four biggest suppliers, Atos earned £700 million in revenue from the public sector in the UK in 2012; of £7.2 billion sales worldwide. Atos holds £3 billion worth of UK government contracts providing services to a wide range of organizations including NHS Scotland, Home Office,\\"The Great Border Agency IT crash. Just who was responsible?\\" by Anna Leach. 1 June 2012 Welsh Government, the Ministry of Defence, Transport for Greater Manchester, the BBC and a multimillion outsourcing contract to NS&I.;NS&I; awards outsourcing contract to Atos In the United Kingdom, from 1998 - 2015 the company was at the centre of a controversy over the management of contracts by their healthcare division of the Work Capability Assessment for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\\"Disability benefit assessments 'unfair', says ex-worker\\".  Asia- Pacific  In January 2017, Atos secured a five-year contract as key IT partner of the Western Australian state government. Extendable for an additional five years, the deal (up to $2.39 billion) will be allocated with two other ICT suppliers.  Controversy  = Atos Healthcare = In the United Kingdom, from 1998 to 2015, Atos Healthcare was at the centre of a controversy over the management of contracts by their healthcare division of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). In August 2015, statistics from the DWP showed that 2,380 people had died between 2011 and 2014 soon after being found fit for work through disability benefit assessments. In 2014, \\"the DWP negotiated an early exit from the existing WCA contract with the private firm, Atos, after raising concerns about the quality of its work\\". However, Atos still (as of October 2016) continued to undertake work for the DWP in assessing Personal Independence Payment (PIP) applications. The Press Association revealed in 2017 that Atos, used by the DWP to make its decisions, were set to be paid more than £700m for their five-year contracts against an original estimate of £512m. When Atos took over administering PIP, estimates of how fast claims could be processed were over-optimistic as were estimates of how easily claimants could get to assessment centres. This led to delays in assessments, distress to claimants and unexpectedly high costs. Atos was accused of misleading the government. Atos developed a computer system that would extract data from GP's computers nationwide. Costs rose from £14 million to £40 million and it was felt Atos had taken insufficient care how it spent taxpayers' money. When Atos lost the contract for fitness to work tests, Richard Hawkes of Scope said, \\"I doubt there's a single disabled person who'll be sorry to hear that Atos will no longer be running the fit-for-work tests.\\" Hawkes claimed the \\"fundamentally flawed\\" test should be \\"more than an exercise in getting people off benefits. It should make sure disabled people get the specialist, tailored and flexible support they need to find and keep a job.\\" Mark Serwotka of Public and Commercial Services Union described the assessments as \\"designed to harass vulnerable people and take their benefits away rather than provide support and guidance. Doctors, MPs and disabled people all believe the tests should be scrapped so, instead of replacing the failed Atos with another profit-hungry provider, the government should bring the work in-house and invest in it properly.\\" Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron questioned how Atos and Capita could have been paid over £500m from tax payers money for assessing fitness to work as 61% who appealed won their appeals. Farron stated, \\"This adds to the suspicion that these companies are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right. They are the ugly face of business.\\" In 2014, Atos Healthcare rebranded its occupational health business to become OH Assist. The Atos Healthcare brand was reserved for use for the PIP contract. Atos sold its OH Assist business to CBPE Capital in 2015. For a number of years Atos denied claimants benefits or reduced their benefits if they did not take addictive opiate based pain killers. The Department of Work and Pensions subsequently revised its guidance stating, \\"healthcare practitioners [disability benefits assessors] should be mindful that the level of analgesia used does not necessarily correlate with the level of pain\\". = Corporation tax = It was disclosed in November 2013 through the National Audit Office that Atos had paid no corporation tax at all in the UK in 2012. The total value of contracts that had been awarded to Atos by June 2013 was approximately £1.6 billion. Sponsorship =Olympic/Paralympic Games= Atos has been the official IT Partner for the Olympic Games since 2001 and is expected to continue until at least 2024. Atos, through the SchlumbergerSema's acquisition, was involved in previous Games during the 1990s, starting with the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Atos has been one of 11 major sponsors for the Olympic Games since 2001. In 2011, some UK-based disability campaign groups called for a boycott of the 2012 Summer Paralympics due to Atos' sponsorship of the games and Atos Healthcare's UK contract to perform Work Capability Assessments on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) During the first week of the Paralympics in the summer of 2012, activists and disabled people targeted Atos in a series of nationwide protests. This culminated on Friday 31 August with a demonstration outside Atos headquarters in London,\\"Atos protesters clash with police in 'day of action' against Paralympics sponsor\\" 31 August 2012. The Guardian which ended in a confrontation with the police. Through the International Olympic Committee's TOP (The Olympic Partner) programme, Atos has sponsored athletes from all over the globe in order to support their Olympic ambitions, including Danny Crates, the 2004 Paralympic Champion in the 800m. =2014 Commonwealth Games= Atos was named as an official supporter of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. On 26 June 2013, \\"Glasgow Against Atos\\" occupied one of the Commonwealth Games venues in protest against Atos sponsorship.Chris Hoy Velodrome Occupied Games Monitor 2014 =2015 Southeast Asian Games= Atos was the official sponsor of 2015 Southeast Asian Games in Singapore.Official Sponsors 2015 South East Asian Games = 2018 European Championships = In February 2017 Atos has been appointed as the first official sponsor of the Glasgow 2018 European Championships.

He started his career working as a planetary geologist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey, in Flagstaff, Arizona. Later, Masursky joined NASA as a senior science member, where he worked in the areas of economic, structural and planetary geology. He was responsible for the investigation of planetary and lunar surfaces, being interested in finding scientifically valuable landing places. This included the Apollo, where, in the 1960's, he played a major role in choosing landing sites. In the 1970s, he headed the team that mapped the surface of Mars and was once again involved in choosing landing sites, this time for the Viking missions. In the 1980s, he worked with the Voyager program to explore the surfaces of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Masursky worked on numerous space missions and programs including Ranger, Surveyor, Lunar Orbiter, Mariner 9, Pioneer Venus, as well as on the Galileo and Magellan spacecrafts. A key role was his work as the president of the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature of the International Astronomical Union. In 1985 Masursky was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award Gold Medal, which is the highest honorary recognition an employee can receive within the Department of the Interior. Quoting from the award, the 1985 USGS Yearbook states: “Harold Masursky, Geologist, for his imaginative leadership in the field of astrogeology which has influenced almost every facet of lunar and planetary exploration since the beginning of the nation's space program.” A crater on Mars and the asteroid 2685 Masursky were named in his honor. The Masursky Award and the Masursky Lecture are named after him as well.

Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa, Otacon was introduced in the series in Metal Gear Solid. In Metal Gear Solid, Otacon, an ArmsTech employee who designed Metal Gear REX, becomes a close ally of Solid Snake upon learning of REX's nuclear strike capabilities. After the events of Metal Gear Solid, he helped Solid Snake form Philanthropy, a group whose main objective is to prevent proliferation of Metal Gear-type weapons. Snake and Otacon infiltrate the military installations and facilities of the world, delving into their compounds through stealth and cyber hacking. In a sense, Snake is the brawn and Otacon is the brains behind \\"Philanthropy.\\" A devoted fan of anime, Hal's chosen nickname is the short form of the Otaku Convention, with reference to Otakon held in Washington, D.C. each year. The name \\"Hal\\" is a direct reference to the computer HAL 9000 from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of several references to the film which is present in Metal Gear Solid; in the Otacon ending of the game, Hal and Snake make direct comparisons to the film. Critical reception of Otacon has been positive, with praise being particularly directed towards his and Snake's friendship. Concept and design \\"Hal\\" is a tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kojima states that he created Otacon as his way of glorifying the otaku stereotype by having a character who fights the terrorists with his intellect rather than his brawn. He added that the original idea for Otacon was to make him \\"heavier, wearing a cap, and programming while eating a chocolate bar\\". However, the design Shinkawa did for the character was a slender one instead. Lead character designer Yoji Shinkawa stated in an interview that Otacon was designed to look somewhat \\"tougher\\" than he did in Metal Gear Solid for the second game. Appearances Hal Emmerich was born in 1980 to Dr. \\"Huey\\" Emmerich and Dr. Strangelove, a pair of former scientists. When Hal was still young, Huey attempted using him as a test pilot for the Metal Gear ST-84, as the machine could only be piloted by a child. Strangelove vehemently opposed this, leading to an argument between Hal's parents and ultimately to his mother's death at his father's hands. Years later, Huey married a British woman named Julie Danziger with a child of her own (Emma). Hal and Emma were close, as they had no other friends. Hal was sexually abused by his stepmother, and she coerced him into keeping a brief affair. Upon learning this, Huey committed suicide by drowning himself in the family pool, and attempted to drown Emma as well. Emma expected Hal to save her, but he did not know it was happening since at the time he was with his stepmother. After the incident, Emma became estranged from her stepbrother, blaming him for not saving her. Shortly afterwards, Hal ran away from home and did not see any of his family members until several years later. Choosing not to continue school, he began to educate himself via the Internet. He became a big fan of anime, and started calling himself Otacon, short for the \\"Otaku Convention\\", which he never misses. He matriculated at MIT and earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University. During his college years, he was recruited by the FBI's Engineering Research Facility, but was fired from his job after hacking into their classified database. Otacon was hired by Armstech, Inc. to be the lead engineer for the Metal Gear REX project.\\"Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview,\\" Game Informer 182 (June 2008): 108. He jumped at the chance to make an actual mecha type robot, which appears frequently in the anime he enjoys. He was led to believe that it was a mobile defense system, but in reality it was a nuclear doomsday weapon. In 2005, during the Shadow Moses incident (the events of Metal Gear Solid), Otacon encountered Solid Snake who had informed him of the true nature of Metal Gear REX. Devastated, Otacon realized that he had written yet another chapter in his family's dark history—his grandfather had worked on the Manhattan Project, and his father was born on the day of the Hiroshima bombing. Otacon had developed a strong attraction to FOXHOUND member Sniper Wolf. Distraught that Snake would have to kill her, Otacon eventually came to terms with her, himself, and his position in life. With Otacon's assistance, Snake was able to destroy REX and defeat the terrorist uprising. According to the in-universe novel In the Darkness of Shadow Moses: The Unofficial Truth, Otacon had allegedly left for Great Britain after the events of the terrorist uprising to visit relatives. After the schematics for Metal Gear were placed on the black market by Revolver Ocelot, Snake and Otacon formed Philanthropy, an organization dedicated to the end of the proliferation of Metal Gear-type weapons. In 2007 (the events of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty), Otacon received an email from his step sister Emma, informing him of a new prototype Metal Gear RAY. The e-mail was actually a bait for the Patriots to lure Solid Snake out of hiding and frame him for terrorism, by having Ocelot hijack RAY and place the blame on Snake with forged evidence. When the tanker was destroyed by Ocelot, Otacon took a boat and managed to save Snake, as well as Olga Gurlukovich. Otacon was forced to fake Snake's death after he was framed by the Patriots. Using connections he had with an organization, he managed to steal Liquid Snake's corpse (which was missing its right arm) and dumped it into the sea. He continued to manage Philanthropy's activities, while keeping Snake's survival a secret from the public. In 2009, he received another anonymous e-mail, this time from Liquid (while taking over Ocelot's mind), informing him about the development of Arsenal Gear in the Big Shell. When Solidus Snake seized the Big Shell, he infiltrated the facility with SEAL Team 10 to find Emma, who was among the hostages. He managed to be reunited with her, but she died shortly afterwards, due to stab wounds inflicted by Vamp. Before her death, Emma admitted to always admiring Hal and wanting to follow in his footsteps. Despite falling into deep despair, Snake encouraged him to move on and rescue all the hostages held in the Big Shell. Apparently he was successful in this, and stays in contact to support Raiden until he defeated Solidus. When Snake met Otacon at their hideout he was given the disk that contained the data of the Wisemen's Committee to look over, which included their names and whereabouts. After this (the ending note) Otacon told Snake about the information on the disc: the twelve Wisemen had been dead for about 100 years. Otacon appeared once more as Old Snake's support man in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, set in 2014. He and Sunny built a robotic companion to Snake called Metal Gear Mk. II, which he controlled remotely. The Mk. II was taken from a robotic character of the same name in Snatcher. He became romantically involved with Naomi Hunter through the course of the story although he once again lost her upon her suicide, thus forcing him yet again to witness the death of a woman he cared about. In the finale, Otacon told Snake that he will live with Snake for the remainder of his life, to serve as witness of his existence. By the time of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance in 2018, Otacon is mentioned to have officially adopted Sunny. Outside of the Metal Gear series, Otacon made a guest appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, where he was one of Solid Snake's support crew available through taunting. Reception Otacon is widely regarded as one of the best sidekick type characters in video games. As such, he was declared the best \\"buddy in gaming\\" by Machinima.com in 2010. Cracked.com included him on their 2010 list of six video game sidekicks that are actually more effective than the actual hero at number four, stating: \\"Really, Otacon doesn't need Snake at all. The only thing keeping us from Metal Gear Solid: Nerdy Mouthbreather is the fact that Otacon pees all over himself when he's scared and has sex with his stepmother.\\" In 2011, UGO Networks ranked him the sixth best video game companion, comparing him to Q of James Bond, while Maximum PC listed him among 25 of gaming's greatest sidekicks, commenting that \\"Snake wouldn’t be half the man he is without Otacon backing him up.\\" In 2013, Hanuman Welch of Complex ranked Otacon and Meryl Silverburgh ex equo at fourth place on a list of video game sidekicks that deserve their own titles.13 Video Game Sidekicks That Deserve Their Own Titles, Complex.com, July 12, 2013. In GameSpot's poll \\"All- Time Greatest Game Sidekick\\", Otacon got to the semi-finals, before losing to Albert Einstein of the Command & Conquer: Red Alert series. Otacon was ranked the fourth best Metal Gear character by Play. 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey ranked Otacon's reaction to the death of Sniper Wolf at second place in his 2009 list of the series' \\"most awkward\\" moments, calling it \\"the world's most embarrassingly stupid case of Stockholm syndrome.\\" Among other reception, Marissa Meli of UGO placed him at third place on her 2010 list of the greatest Jewish characters in video games and Ryan Woo of Complex ranked him as the sixth most stylish video game character for his Metal Gear Solid 4 outfit in 2011. In 2012, Complex also put him and Solid Snake at second place on their list of \\"Most A**-Kicking Video Game Duos\\", GamesRadar included him among the \\"13 unluckiest bastards in gaming\\".

She was built in the United States and commissioned into the RAN in 1980. During her career, Adelaide was part of Australian responses or contributions to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état, the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, the Indonesian riots of May 1998, the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, the War in Afghanistan, and the United States-led invasion of Iraq. In 1997, the frigate rescued two competitors in the 1996–97 Vendée Globe solo, round-the- world yacht race. In 2001, a boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants was intercepted by Adelaide; the events of this interception became the centre of the Children overboard affair. In 2008, Adelaide was the second ship of the class to be decommissioned, in order to offset the cost of an upgrade to the other four vessels. This ship was to be sunk off Avoca Beach, New South Wales as a dive wreck on 27 March 2010, until an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by protest groups led to a postponement of the scuttling until additional cleanup work was completed. Despite further attempts to delay or cancel the scuttling, Adelaide was sunk off Avoca on 13 April 2011.

Adelaides Mark 13 launcher, with a dummy Standard missile loaded The original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets were fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the Adelaides later carried the Mark 46 torpedoes. Up to six machine guns were carried for close-in defence, and beginning in 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts were installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments.Scott, Enhanced small-calibre systems offer shipborne stopping power The sensor suite included an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters could be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel. Adelaide was laid down to the Oliver Hazard Perry class' Flight I design at Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle on 29 July 1977, launched on 21 June 1978 by Lady Ann Synnot (wife of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot), and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy on 15 November 1980.Perryman, Ships Named Adelaide, p. 2 During construction, she was identified with the United States Navy hull number FFG-17. A total of four Adelaide-class ships were constructed by Todd Pacific, with a further two built by Australian shipbuilder AMECON. Operational history After commissioning, Adelaide and Canberra remained in the United States to work up; during this time both ships were attached to the United States Navy's Destroyer Squadron 9. The frigate ran aground off Seattle in early 1981, during post-commissioning trials, but was freed with only minor damage. Following the decommissioning of the aircraft carrier in 1982 and the disbandment of fixed-wing aviation squadrons in 1984, the RAN Fleet Air Arm became focused on helicopter operations, but had minimal experience flying helicopters from small ships.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 247 To remedy this, a Bell Kiowa was embarked aboard Adelaide during 1984. Adelaide was awarded the Gloucester Cup for being the most efficient ship in the RAN during 1984. In May 1987, Adelaide visited Fiji, and was alongside in Lautoka when the first of the 1987 Fijian coups d'état occurred on 14 May.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 260 Adelaide and sister ship , alongside in Suva, were instructed to remain off Fiji to aid in any necessary evacuation of Australian citizens; the first component of what became Operation Morris Dance. Adelaide remained on station until at least 29 May, when a phased withdrawal began. On 3 July 1990, Adelaide became the first Australian warship to visit Tahiti since 1970.Bendle et al., Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005, p. 6 On 10 August, Adelaide, sister ship , and the replenishment ship were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Damask, Australia's participation in the international coalition enforcing sanctions against Iraq following that nation's invasion of Kuwait.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 261 Adelaide and Darwin remained in the area until 3 December, and was used for surveillance and boarding operations.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 263 In October 1992, Adelaide home port was changed to , making her the first ship of the class homeported in Western Australia under the Two-Ocean Policy.Perryman, Ships Named Adelaide, p. 3 Adelaide underway in 1982 In January 1997, the yachts of Thierry Dubois and Tony Bullimore (competitors in the 1996–97 Vendée Globe solo, round-the-world yacht race), capsized while attempting to cross the Southern Ocean.Grazebrook, A Drop in the Ocean?

J. Habibie. In February 1999, Adelaide was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup awarded to the most efficient ship in the RAN during the previous year.Adelaide's pair of cups, in Navy News The frigate was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 19 October.Stevens, Strength Through Diversity, p. 15 On 6 October 2001, Adelaide was the ship which intercepted SIEV 4, the event which sparked the Children overboard affair.Senate Select Committee, A Certain Maritime Incident Under orders to prevent SIEVs from entering Australian waters, Adelaide attempted to warn the craft, carrying over 200 passengers (including children), against crossing from international waters during the night and into 7 October. When the SIEV failed to heed these warnings, Adelaide fired warning shots and initiated a RHIB boarding action, with the boarding party took control of the craft that afternoon. Between this time and when the craft was manoeuvred from Australian territory late the next morning, several attempts were made to sabotage the craft, and some adult passengers jumped or were thrown overboard while others threatened to do so; the fourteen people that entered the water were recovered by the frigate's RHIB and taken back to the SIEV. Adelaide observed the craft as it headed towards Indonesia, and moved in to provide further assistance a few hours later, after systematic sabotage immobilised the small vessel. Adelaide was instructed to take the vessel in tow and head for Christmas Island. The SIEV began to take on water during the afternoon of 8 October, and despite the appearance that the problem had been rectified, the craft sank without warning at 17:00. All aboard were forced into the water, and were rescued by personnel from Adelaide. Reports of the sinking were conflated with information about those who jumped or were thrown overboard the day previous to give the impression that the threat of throwing children overboard had been made or carried out, a story that was later proven false but taken up at the time by the Howard government during the lead-up to the 2001 election to support their campaign promises to tighten border controls and immigration.Senate Select Committee, Executive Summary From November 2001 to March 2002, Adelaide and the amphibious warfare ship were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Slipper, the Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan.Bendle et al., Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005, p. 44 The ships also contributed to the continuing enforcement of the Iraq sanctions. Adelaide was deployed on border protection operations on multiple occasions until 2004. Adelaide returned to the Middle East from July 2004 to January 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst, the Australian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq following the United States-led invasion in 2003.Bendle et al., Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005, p. 60 During this deployment, in December 2004, several gunboats of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard attempted to capture a boarding party after it had inspected the freighter MV Sham, which had grounded near the Iraq-Iran maritime boundary.Gardner, Iran 'unable to take AustraliansAustralian Associated Press, Australians repelled Iranian navy After completing their inspection, the boarding party returned to their two RHIBs, but were approached by an Iranian gunboat. The boarding party climbed back aboard Sham, took up defensive positions, and, according to BBC reporter Frank Gardner, \\"warned [the Iranians] to back off, using what was said to be 'highly colourful language'.\\" During the next 45 minutes, four more gunboats arrived, and the stand-off lasted for four hours before the Australians were evacuated by Adelaides Seahawk helicopter. No shots were fired during the incident, and two of the Australians were later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their conduct during the stand-off. The Australian Defence Force did not immediately report the incident to the media, as they felt no need to highlight it, and the attempted capture did not come to light until July 2007, when Gardner wrote about it following the capture of 15 British personnel during a similar incident in March 2007.

The inuksugaq (or inukshuk) of stone allow these children to find their way back if they can convince the ijiraq to let them go.  Description  In North Baffin dialects ijiraq means Shape Shifter. While Tariaksuq appear like a half-man-half- caribou monster, an Ijiraq can appear in any form it chooses, making it particularly deceptive. Their eyes will always stay red, no matter what they shapeshift into. Their real form is just like a human, but their eyes and mouth are sideways. (The bookFabeldieren, Floortje Zwigtman, september 2017 of Dutch writer Floortje Zwigtman says only the shaman knows the real form of the Ijiraq). When you are hunting somewhere that Ijirait (plural) inhabit, you will see them in the corner of your eye for a fleeting moment (like tariaksuq, shadow people) (following another referenceMythical creatures catalogue: Ijiraq , you see a strange caribou in the corner of your eye instead of a normal shadow). If you try to observe them directly however, they are completely elusive. They are sometimes helpful, sometimes fatally deceptive.  Freeman's Cove  One of the most noted places in the Arctic for sightings of these shape shifters (and tariaksuq) is the Freeman's Cove area of Tuktusirvik (place to hunt caribou), Bathurst Island (Nunavut). This rich oasis is surrounded in a horseshoe pattern by dormant volcanic mountains. Historically, Freeman's Cove is most notable as a stopover for the ship the Intrepid, and also for the failed attempts by the infamous modern-day explorer and eccentric Cory K. Buott at settlement.  Story  The Ijirait are said to inhabit a place between two worlds; not quite inside this one, nor quite out of it. Inuit further south than the North Baffin group used to hold to a belief that some Inuit went too far north in the chase for game, and became trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living, and thus became the Ijirait. According to the small handful of surviving elders in the South Baffin Region that are knew these beliefs, the Inuit that are settled in Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord are these shape shifters or shadow people, because they went too far north. Some elders will avoid being in presence of extreme-northern Inuit, fearing they are evil Ijirait or Tariaksuq. The home of the Ijirait is said to be cursed, and one will lose their way, no matter how skilled or familiar with the land: Buott and his wife Enoogoo were said to be out hunting once on the small peninsula across the bay from Freeman's Cove, and Buott, despite being a renowned navigator, became completely turned around. While he and his wife had been there before, and they could clearly see the camp where their children were on the horizon, Buott had to closely follow the trail of disturbed shale and rock to get back. It is thought by many that this temporary disorientation was due to the influence of the Ijirait. When Enoogoo and Buott finally returned to their children, they discovered a polar bear was circling the camp, sizing their children up for a meal. A local hunter with considerable local knowledge, Mark Amarualik, also of Resolute Bay, was said to have experienced this disorientation in the same place on a hunting trip a year before. The Inuit believe the Ijirait do this to confuse Inuit (people), and to keep them from moving into their areas. It is believed locally that is why Buott and Amarualik experienced this disorientation.  Scientific explanation  One plausible explanation for this unusual phenomenon is likely related to large deposits of sour gas, of which can be disturbed by simply walking over top of the pockets, causing them to expel the toxic gas hydrogen sulphide. Buott and Enoogoo made reference in their journals of inexplicable gatherings of a variety of animal remains in seemingly random and mysterious piles. This corroborates the thought that the gas is responsible for these occurrences. Gas and sulphur smoke have been reported in the area as well as hot water springs discovered by the Amarualik (meaning wolf-like) family; all of which could cause a \\"mirage\\" causing to the traveller to see things such as Ijirait and Tariaksuq. The gas vapour or pockets low in oxygen could also account for hallucinations/sensations of being watched.  References  Verified Sources: * Cory K.

His younger brother, György Deák-Bárdos, was also a composer. Together with Kodály, Bárdos laid the foundations of 20th- century Hungarian choral music. From 1928 to 1967 he was a professor at the Academy, where he reformed the syllabus––emphasizing the training of choral conductors, the teaching of church music history, and instruction in music theory and prosody. In 1931, along with György Kerényi and Gyula Kertész, he founded the publishing company Magyar Kórus (Hungarian Chorus), publishing 2,000 works of old masters and modern composers over the next 20 years, before being shut down by the communist regime in 1950. As the most active disseminator of sacred music in Hungary, Bárdos was targeted at the time with threatening criticism. (For example, one writer in the new journal Éneklö Nép (Singing People) proclaimed, \\"We must take care to eradicate men such as Lajos Bárdos as soon as possible!\\")Beckles Wilson, Rachel. Ligeti, Kurtág, and Hungarian Music during the Cold War. Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 29. The irony is that the rich supply of music provided by Magyar Kórus had allowed schools across Hungary to organize concerts based on those works. That same group of works also served as the basis for the \\"Singing Youth\\" movement, which Bárdos founded in 1934, and which encouraged young people across Hungary to join choral groups and learn the basics of music. And the impetus to promote choral music in the first place came largely from Kodály's observation––made when both he and Bárdos were young musicians––that whereas only a few of the elite had the privilege of having an education in instrumental music, on the other hand, \\"everybody has a voice\\".Gách, Marianne. \\"When the Teacher Likes His Students and His Subject\\". http://www.bardoslajos.hu/bl_cikkek_when.php . Through his work as a conductor Bárdos raised the standards of Hungarian choral singing to the highest international level within decades. He directed several choirs and encouraged the development of choral activity in remote areas of the country. His repertory was pioneering: he included choral music from before Palestrina––especially that of Josquin––while also promoting new music (for instance, he directed the Palestrina Choir's performance of Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms in 1932, to great success––and praises from Stravinsky).\\"Bárdos Lajos munkásságáról angolul\\". http://www.bardoslajos.org/hu/cikkek/72-bardos-lajos-munkassagarol- angolul.html . He also promoted new music in other ways. For example, in 1947 he invited Olivier Messiaen to Budapest, where he both lectured and performed for two weeks.Beckles Wilson, Rachel. György Kurtág: The Sayings of Péter Bornemisza Op.7. Ashgate, 2004, p.15. Bárdos' own compositions draw on Renaissance polyphony and Hungarian folk music, following in the tradition of Bartók and Kodály. In all, he composed some 800 pieces––including folk song arrangements, choral masses, motets, secular pieces based on poems, theatrical accompaniments, songs, and instrumental music. Bárdos' work as a musicologist included major studies of Gregorian melody, modal and Romantic harmony, and the analysis of works by Liszt, Bartók, and Kodály. Well known papers include \\"The Modal Harmony in Liszt's Work\\", and \\"Heptatonia Secunda\\" (which is considered by some to be the best study of Kodály in all of musical literature). When the first essay of the volume Folk Rhythm in Bartók's Music was published, it inspired a younger generation to research Bartók further. His lectures at the Academy were famous for their clarity and liveliness, and he had a full house at all times, regardless of the subject matter. His pupils at the Academy included György Kurtág, who decades later dedicated two compositions to him (Op. 11, song #2, and Op. 12). György Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending Bárdos' lectures while they were both teaching at the Academy.Steinitz, Richard. György Ligeti: Music of the Imagination. Faber and Faber, 2003, p.31. He later credited Bárdos' lectures with having an influence on his own early compositions.Ligeti in conversation with Istvan Szigeti, broadcast on Budapest Radio on 29 July 1983. http://ronsen.org/monkminkpinkpunk/9/gl4.html Between the wars (for almost 20 years, until 1944) Bárdos composed the music for several large-scale \\"movement dramas\\" produced by the pioneering Hungarian modern dancer Valéria Dienes (herself a former student––and only authorized translator into Hungarian––of the French philosopher Henri Bergson, as well as being the founder of the first school of eurhythmics in Hungary). The teaching methods that Bárdos developed contributed to what has since come to be known as the Kodály Method of musical training. \\"Lajos Bárdos Music Week\\" has been an annual festival in Hungary since 1977.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He is one of five American players to win both an Olympic gold medal and a World Series championship which he won with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 over the St. Louis Cardinals. High school Mientkiewicz attended Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay, Florida, where he was a teammate of Alex Rodriguez. Upon graduation, he was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the twelfth round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose instead to play at Florida State University. College career In his third season with the Seminoles, Mientkiewicz led the team with a .371 batting average, 19 home runs and 80 runs batted in. Florida State earned their first Atlantic Coast Conference Championship, and Mientkiewicz was named ACC Atlantic I Regional Most Valuable Player. After the season, Mientkiewicz was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the fifth round of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. Mientkiewicz was elected to the Florida State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005. Minor league career In 1998, he batted .323, with a .432 on-base percentage and .508 slugging percentage in 509 at-bats for the New Britain Rock Cats to earn Eastern League (Double-A) All-Star honors, and a September call-up to the Twins. He batted .200 with two runs batted in in 25 at-bats for the Twins. Mientkiewicz earned a roster spot with the Twins the following spring without having playing in Triple-A, and batted .229 with two home runs and 32 runs batted in sharing playing time with Ron Coomer at first base in 1999. After a full season in the majors, Mientkiewicz spent the 2000 season with the Twins' Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Buzz. He was the Triple-A All-Star first baseman, and Pacific Coast League All-Star designated hitter. He batted .334, with a .446 on-base percentage and a .524 slugging percentage in 485 at-bats for Salt Lake, while both scoring and driving in 96 runs. After the Triple-A season, Mientkiewicz joined the U.S. Olympic team at the 2000 games in Sydney. Mientkiewicz hit the game-winning home run against South Korea in the semi-finals to help the U.S. capture its first-ever gold medal in baseball. Following the Olympics, he spent three games with the Twins, collecting six hits in fourteen at-bats. Major league career =Minnesota Twins= In 2001, Mientkiewicz was awarded the starting first base job for the Twins, and responded by batting .306 with fifteen home runs and 74 runs batted in (all career highs) while earning the American League Gold Glove award for top defensive first baseman. His numbers dipped in 2002; however, he reached the post-season for the first time in his career, and hit two home runs in the 2002 American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics. The Twins battled the Chicago White Sox and Kansas City Royals for the division crown all season long in 2003. Mientkiewicz drew the ire of the Chicago White Sox and their fans by suggesting that the All-Star Game, scheduled to be played at U.S. Cellular Field on July 15, should be moved to a different venue after a fan attacked umpire Laz Diaz during an April 15 game between the White Sox and Royals. Chicago White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams shot back that Mientkiewicz should not worry about the game's location because he would not be there. The fans booed Mientkiewicz the first time he and the Twins came to U.S. Cellular Field on April 25, and cheered White Sox starter Mark Buehrle for hitting Mientkiewicz with a pitch during his first at-bat. Following a mid-September three-game sweep over the White Sox at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome that gave the Twins a game lead in the American League Central, Mientkiewicz again got himself in the crosshairs by commenting in a postgame television interview, \\"They're done,\\" about his Central Division rivals. The Twins won the division by four games over the Chicago White Sox, but were eliminated by the New York Yankees in the 2003 American League Division Series. =Boston Red Sox= As the trade deadline approached, the 2004 Boston Red Sox found themselves games in back of the New York Yankees in the American League East, and one game in back of the Texas Rangers in the wild card race. With infield defense proving to be their Achilles' heel, they made a four-team trade deadline deal on July 31 that landed Mientkiewicz and Montreal Expos shortstop Orlando Cabrera with the Boston Red Sox, and sent Justin Jones to the Twins. The Red Sox also sent Nomar Garciaparra and Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and the Cubs sent Francis Beltrán, Alex Gonzalez and Brendan Harris to the Expos as part of this trade. Mientkiewicz and Cabrera proved valuable additions to their new franchise as the Red Sox surged to within three games of the Yankees by the end of the season, and took the A.L. wild card by seven games over the Oakland A's. On August 16, Mientkiewicz made an emergency start at second base, a position he had only ever played four times in the minor leagues, and never in the majors. Mientkiewicz went 4-for-10 in the post-season. He did not appear in any of the first three games of the 2004 American League Championship Series that the Red Sox lost to the New York Yankees; however, he appeared in all of the final four that they won in their come-from-behind series win. When St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Édgar Rentería grounded back to pitcher Keith Foulke, who trotted toward first base and underhanded the ball to Mientkiewicz to complete Boston's four-game sweep of the World Series, Mientkiewicz kept the ball, as dictated by baseball tradition. As Boston had not won a World Series in 86 years, the ball symbolized the end of the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\", and was of considerable interest to memorabilia collectors. Controversy resulted when the Red Sox asked for the ball's return, and Mientkiewicz refused to give it back. Shortly after his January 27 trade to the New York Mets, Mientkiewicz and the Red Sox reached an agreement that the Red Sox would hold the ball temporarily and could display it across New England, along with the World Series trophy. The agreement called for Mientkiewicz to get the ball back at the end of 2005 unless the ultimate issue of ownership has been otherwise resolved. In the controversy that followed, Mientkiewicz received death threats against himself and his wife. On November 30, 2005, lawyers for the Red Sox filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court asking the court to place the ball in a secure location until ownership was decided. The club's legal team said that Mientkiewicz had gained possession of the ball only because he was a Red Sox employee and that the ball remained the team's property. On April 23, 2006, it was announced that he had reached an agreement with the Red Sox, and the ball would go to the Baseball Hall of Fame. =Mets/Royals= Mientkiewicz began the 2005 season as the Mets' everyday first baseman, but lost his starting job to prospect Mike Jacobs by the end of the season. During the following season with the Kansas City Royals, he compiled a .283 batting average and 43 runs batted in, his most since playing with Minnesota. He was not offered a contract by the Royals, and on January 5, 2007, he signed a one-year deal with the New York Yankees. =New York Yankees= On June 2, 2007, Mientkiewicz collided with Mike Lowell of the Boston Red Sox while trying to field a throw from shortstop Derek Jeter. He suffered a mild concussion and a fractured scaphoid bone in his right wrist and was placed on the disabled list. Mientkiewicz missed three months of the season, and did not return until September 4. He made his first start since the injury on September 16, and went two-for-three in the Yankees' 4-3 victory over the Red Sox. For the season, he batted .277 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in. He made the post-season for the fourth time in his career, and was hitless in six at-bats. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Mientkiewicz with the Pirates in Spring Training 2008 On February 11, 2008, Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his only season in Pittsburgh, he batted .277 with two home runs and 30 runs batted in, mostly backing up Adam LaRoche at first base. He also made 33 appearances at third base and ten in right field. He briefly left the team during the season while his wife, Jodi, had heart surgery. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On February 26, 2009, Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made the Major League roster as a pinch hitter and appeared in seven games for the Dodgers in April before dislocating his shoulder sliding into second base and being placed on the 60-day disabled list. After a brief rehab stint with the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes from July 28 to August 17, Mientkiewicz rejoined the Dodgers in September, seeing sporadic action as a pinch hitter down the stretch. He collected six hits in eighteen at-bats, only one of which was for extra bases, and had three runs batted in. Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers for the 2010 season, and came to camp to compete for the left- handed pinch hitter role. He was offered a coaching position with the team when he did not make the club out of spring training, but opted instead to keep playing and become a free agent. =Florida Marlins= On May 5, 2010, he signed a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins, but was released just nine days later after playing four games for the Marlins' Triple A affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs. Mientkiewicz's deal included a one-day out clause for May 16, and the Marlins chose to cut him loose before he could exercise it. Following his release, Mientkiewicz chose to retire from baseball. Broadcasting After retirement, Mientkiewicz worked as an analyst for the 2010 MLB post-season for CBSSports.com. Coaching/managing Mientkiewicz made his coaching debut in 2012 in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as the hitting coach of the rookie league Ogden Raptors in the Pioneer League. After 2012, he was hired by the Minnesota Twins organization as the Manager of the high-Class A Fort Myers Miracle, the team he played for in 1995–96 to start his baseball career. Mientikiewicz got the Miracle off to a fast start in 2013 as the team tied a franchise record by winning their first 14 games of the season (equaling the mark set in 1995 and tied in 2007) and ended April with a Minor League best 21 wins (21-4). In October 2014, Mientkiewicz was a finalist to become the manager of the Minnesota Twins. Ultimately, Paul Molitor was selected as Twins manager, and Mientkiewicz managed the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts in 2015–16 before returning to Fort Myers for a second term as the Miracle's skipper. He was fired after the 2017 season.http://www.twincities.com/2017/09/16/byron-buxton-on-fired-manager- doug-mientkiewicz-more-of-a-brother-to-us/ On November 16, 2017, Mientkiewicz was named the manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A affiliate. On October 31, 2019, he was fired by the Mud Hens.

Biography Furtwängler wrote an 1896 doctoral dissertation at the University of Göttingen on cubic forms (Zur Theorie der in Linearfaktoren zerlegbaren ganzzahlingen ternären kubischen Formen), under Felix Klein. Most of his academic life, from 1912 to 1938, was spent at the University of Vienna, where he taught for example Kurt Gödel, who later said that Furtwängler's lectures on number theory were the best mathematical lectures that he ever heard; Gödel had originally intended to become a physicist but turned to mathematics partly as a result of Furtwängler's lectures. Furtwängler was paralysed and, without notes, lectured from a wheelchair while his assistant wrote equations on the blackboard. Some of Furtwängler's doctoral students were Wolfgang Gröbner, Nikolaus Hofreiter, Henry Mann, Otto Schreier, and Olga Taussky-Todd. Through these and others, he has over 3000 academic descendants. He is now best known for his contribution to the principal ideal theorem in the form of his Beweis des Hauptidealsatzes für Klassenkörper algebraischer Zahlkörper (1929).

The post-classical coinages are by far the most numerous of these. Indirect and direct borrowings Since the living Greek and English languages were not in direct contact until modern times, borrowings were necessarily indirect, coming either through Latin (through texts or various vernaculars), or from Ancient Greek texts, not the living spoken language.Ayers, Donald M. 1986. English Words from Latin and Greek Elements. (2nd ed.). p. 158. =Vernacular borrowings via Romance languages= Some Greek words were borrowed into Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages. English often received these words from French. Some have remained very close to the Greek original, e.g. lamp (Latin: lampas; Greek: λαμπάς). In others, the phonetic and orthographic form has changed considerably. For instance, place was borrowed both by Old English and by French from Latin platea, itself borrowed from Greek πλατεία (ὁδός), 'broad (street)'; the Italian piazza and Spanish plaza have the same origin, and have been borrowed into English in parallel. The word olive comes through the Romance from the Latin olīva, which in turn comes from the Greek elaíwā ().This must have been an early borrowing, since the Latin v reflects a still- pronounced digamma; the earliest attested form of it is the Mycenaean Greek , e-ra3-wo 'elaiwo(n)', attested in Linear B syllabic script. (see C.B. Walker, John Chadwick, Reading the Past: Ancient Writing from Cuneiform to the Alphabet, 1990, , p. 161) The Greek word was in turn apparently borrowed from a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean substrate; cf. Greek substrate language. A later Greek word, boútȳron (),Carl Darling Buck, A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages () notes that the word has the form of a compound βοΰς + τυρός 'cow-cheese', possibly a calque from Scythian, or possibly an adaptation of a native Scythian word. becomes Latin butyrum and eventually English butter. A large group of early borrowings, again transmitted first through Latin, then through various vernaculars, comes from Christian vocabulary: * chair << καθέδρα (cf. 'cathedra'); * bishop << epískopos (); * priest << presbýteros (); and * church < Old English cirice, circe < probably kȳriakḗ [oikía] (). In some cases, the orthography of these words was later changed to reflect the Greek—and Latin—spelling: e.g., quire was respelled as choir in the 17th century. Sometimes this was done incorrectly: ache is from a Germanic root; the spelling ache reflects Samuel Johnson's incorrect etymology from Greek ἄχος.Okrent, Arika. October 8, 2014. \\"5 Words That Are Spelled Weird Because Someone Got the Etymology Wrong.\\" Mental Floss. (Also in OED.) =Learned borrowings= Many more words were borrowed by scholars writing in Medieval and Renaissance Latin. Some words were borrowed in essentially their original meaning, often transmitted through Classical Latin: topic, type, physics, iambic, eta, necromancy, cosmopolite. A few result from scribal errors: encyclopedia < Greek: (not a compound in Greek); acne < ἀκνή (erroneous) < . Some kept their Latin form, e.g., podium < Greek . Others were borrowed unchanged as technical terms, but with specific, novel meanings: * telescope < Greek , refers to an optical instrument for seeing far away rather than a person who can see far into the distance; * phlogiston < , is a supposed fire-making potential rather than something which has been burned, or can be burned; and * bacterium < , is a kind of microorganism rather than a small stick or staff. This also applies to combining forms used in neologisms: * -cyte or cyto- < Greek , means biological cells, not arbitrary containers. * -oma < , a generic morpheme forming deverbal nouns, such as diploma ('a folded thing') and glaucoma ('greyness'), comes to have the very narrow meaning of 'tumor' or 'swelling', on the model of words like carcinoma < . For example, melanoma does not come from Greek , but rather from the modern combining forms melano- ('dark' [in biology]) + -oma ('tumor'). * -ase, used in chemistry for enzymes, is abstracted from diastase, where -ασις is not a morpheme at all. =Usage in neologisms= But by far the largest Greek contribution to English vocabulary is the huge number of scientific, medical, and technical neologisms that have been coined by compounding Greek roots and affixes to produce novel words which never existed in the Greek language: * utopia (1516; + ) * zoology (1669; ζῷον + λογία) * hydrodynamics (1738; + ) * photography (1834; + ) * oocyte (1895; + ) * helicobacter (1989; + ) So it is really the combining forms of Greek roots and affixes that are borrowed, not the words. Such terms are coined in all the European languages, and spread to the others freely—including to Modern Greek as reborrowings. Traditionally, these coinages were constructed using only Greek morphemes, e.g., metamathematics, but increasingly, Greek, Latin, and other morphemes are combined. These hybrid words were formerly considered to be 'barbarisms', such as: * television (Greek: + Latin: vision); * metalinguistic (Greek: + Latin: lingua + Greek: + Greek: ); and * garbology (English: garbage + Greek: ). Some derivations are idiosyncratic, for example: * utopia and gas (< Greek: ) are irregular both in formation and in spelling; * hadron < Greek: with the suffix -on, itself abstracted from Greek anion (); * henotheism < Greek: + , though eno- is not used as a prefix in Greek; and * taxonomy < Greek: + -nomy (), where the \\"more etymological form\\" is ,Both are used in French; see: Jean-Louis Fisher, Roselyne Rey, \\"De l'origine et de l'usage des termes taxinomie-taxonomie\\", Documents pour l’histoire du vocabulaire scientifique, Institut national de la langue française, 1983, 5:97-113 as found in the Greek , 'taxiarch', and the neologism taxidermy. Modern Greek uses in its reborrowing.Andriotis et al., Λεξικό της κοινής νεοελληνικής = Triantafyllidis Dictionary, s.v. In standard chemical nomenclature, the numerical prefixes are \\"only loosely based on the corresponding Greek words\\", e.g. octaconta- is used for 80 instead of the Greek ogdoeconta- '80'. There are also \\"mixtures of Greek and Latin roots\\", e.g., nonaconta-, for 90, is a blend of the Latin nona- for 9 and the Greek -conta- found in words such as ἐνενήκοντα enenekonta '90'.N. Lozac'h, \\"Extension of Rules A-1.1 and A-2.5 concerning numerical terms used in organic chemical nomenclature (Recommendations 1986)\\", Pure and Applied Chemistry 58:12:1693-1696 , under \\"Discussion\\", p. 1694-1695 full textdeep link to WWW version The Greek form is, however, used in the names of polygons in mathematics, though the names of polyhedra are more idiosyncratic. Many Greek affixes such as anti- and -ic have become productive in English, combining with arbitrary English words: antichoice, Fascistic. Some portmanteau words in English have led to suffixes based on Greek words, but which are not suffixes in Greek, e.g., -athon or -a-thon (walkathon, from walk + ) and -nomics (Reaganomics, from Reagan + ). =Through other languages= Some Greek words were borrowed through Arabic and then Romance. Many are learned: * alchemy (al- + Greek: or ) * elixir (al- + ) * alembic (al- + ) However, others are popular: * botargo () * tajine () * possibly quintal ( < Latin: centenarium (pondus)). Curiously, chemist appears to be a back-formation from alchemist. A few words took other routes: * Seine (a kind of fishing net) comes from a West Germanic form *sagīna, from Latin: sagēna, from Greek: σαγήνη. * Effendi comes from Turkish, borrowed from Medieval Greek: αυθέντης (/afˈθendis/, 'lord'). =Vernacular or learned doublets= Some Greek words have given rise to etymological doublets, being borrowed both through a later learned, direct route, and earlier through an organic, indirect route:Walter William Skeat, A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, \\"List of Doublets\\", p. 599ff (full text)Edward A. Allen, \\"English Doublets\\", Publications of the Modern Language Association of America 23:2:184-239 (1908) * ἀμυγδάλη amygdala, almond; * ἀντίφωνα antiphon, anthem; * ἀσϕόδελος asphodel, daffodil; * αὐθεντικός authentic, effendi (αὐθέντης via Turkish); * βάλσαμον balsam (probably itself a borrowing from Semitic), balm; * βάσις basis, base, bass (voice); * βλάσφημος blasphemy, blame; * βούτυρον , butter; * διάβολος , devil; * δραχμή drachma, dram, also dirhem via Arabic; * ἔλαιον elaeo-, oil, olive, oleum; * ἐλεημοσύνη eleemosynary, alms; * ἐπίσκοπος , bishop; * ζῆλος zeal, jealous; * καθέδρα , chair, chaise; * κέρας/κέρατ- 'horn' keratin, carat via Arabic; * κόλπος 'lap, womb, hollow, bay' , gulf * κυβερνᾶν cybernetics, govern * πάπυρος papyrus, paper; * πόδιον podium, pew; * πρεσβύτερος presbyter, priest; * πυξίς , box; * σκάνδαλον scandal, slander; * τρίπους/τρίποδ- tripod, trivet; * τύμπανον 'drum' tympanum 'eardrum', timbre, timpani; * φρενετικός frenetic, frantic; * χειρουργός chirurgical, surgeon; * χορός chorus, choir; * χρῖσμα chrism, cream; * χρῑστιᾱνός Christian, christen, cretin? * ὥρα , hour. Other doublets come from differentiation in the borrowing languages: * γραμματική : grammar, glamor, grimoire; * δίσκος discus: disc, dish, dais, and desk; * κιθάρα cither: guitar, , zither, gittern, cittern, etc.; * κρύπτη crypt: grotto, (under)croft; * παραβολή parabola: parable; additional doublets in Romance give palaver, parol, and parole; * ϕαντασία phantasy: fantasy; fancy in 15th-century English. =From modern Greek= Finally, with the growth of tourism and emigration, some words reflecting modern Greek culture have been borrowed into English—many of them originally borrowings into Greek themselves: * retsina, souvlaki, taverna (< Italian) * ouzo (disputed etymology) * moussaka (< Turkish < Arabic) * baklava (< Turkish) * feta (< Italian) * bouzouki (< Turkish) * gyro (the food, a calque of Turkish döner). Greek as an intermediary Many words from the Hebrew Bible were transmitted to the western languages through the Greek of the Septuagint, often without morphological regularization: * rabbi () * seraphim () * paradise ( < Hebrew < Persian) * pharaoh ( < Hebrew < Egyptian) Written form of Greek words in English Many Greek words, especially those borrowed through the literary tradition, are recognizable as such from their spelling. Latin had standard orthographies for Greek borrowings, including, but not limited to: * Greek was written as 'y' * as 'e' * as 'ch' * as 'ph' * as 'c' * rough breathings as 'h' * both and as 'i' These conventions, which originally reflected pronunciation, have carried over into English and other languages with historical orthography, like French.Crosby, Henry Lamar, and John Nevin Schaeffer. 1928. An Introduction to Greek. section 66. They make it possible to recognize words of Greek origin, and give hints as to their pronunciation and inflection. The romanization of some digraphs is rendered in various ways in English. The Ancient Greek diphthongs and may be spelled in three different ways in English: # the Latinate digraphs ae and oe; # the ligatures æ and œ; and # the simple letter e. The ligatures have largely fallen out of use worldwide; the digraphs are uncommon in American usage, but remain common in British usage. The spelling depends mostly on the variety of English, not on the particular word. Examples include: encyclopaedia / encyclopædia / encyclopedia; haemoglobin / hæmoglobin / hemoglobin; and oedema / œdema / edema. Some words are almost always written with the digraph or ligature: amoeba / amœba, rarely ameba; Oedipus / Œdipus, rarely Edipus; others are almost always written with the single letter: sphære and hæresie were obsolete by 1700; phænomenon by 1800; phænotype and phænol by 1930. The verbal ending is spelled -ize in American English, and -ise or -ize in British English. Since the 19th century, a few learned words were introduced using a direct transliteration of Ancient Greek and including the Greek endings, rather than the traditional Latin-based spelling: nous (νοῦς), koine (κοινή), hoi polloi (οἱ πολλοί), kudos (κύδος), moron (μωρόν), kubernetes (κυβερνήτης). For this reason, the Ancient Greek digraph is rendered differently in different words--as i, following the standard Latin form: idol < εἴδωλον; or as ei, transliterating the Greek directly: eidetic (< εἰδητικός), deixis, seismic. Most plurals of words ending in -is are -es (pronounced [iːz]), using the regular Latin plural rather than the Greek -εις: crises, analyses, bases, with only a few didactic words having English plurals in -eis: poleis, necropoleis, and acropoleis (though acropolises is by far the most common English plural). Most learned borrowings and coinages follow the Latin system, but there are some irregularities: * eureka (cf. heuristic); * kinetic (cf. cinematography); * krypton (cf. cryptic); * acolyte (< ; would be the etymological spelling, but , , are all found in Latin);Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, s.v. * stoichiometry (< ; regular spelling would be ). * Aneurysm was formerly often spelled aneurism on the assumption that it uses the usual -ism ending. Some words whose spelling in French and Middle English did not reflect their Greco-Latin origins were refashioned with etymological spellings in the 16th and 17th centuries: caracter became character and quire became choir. In some cases, a word's spelling clearly shows its Greek origin: * If it includes ph or includes y between consonants, it is very likely Greek, with some exceptions, such as nephew, cipher, triumph.Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, 1897, s.v., p. 4432 * If it includes rrh, phth, or chth; or starts with hy-, ps-, pn-, or chr-; or the rarer pt-, ct-, chth-, rh-, x-, sth-, mn-, tm-, gn- or bd-, then it is Greek, with some exceptions: gnat, gnaw, gneiss. Other exceptions include: * ptarmigan is from a Gaelic word, the p having been added by false etymology; * style is probably written with a 'y' because the Greek word (as in peristyle, 'surrounded by columns') and the Latin word stilus, 'stake, pointed instrument', were confused. * trophy, though ultimately of Greek origin, did not have a but a in its Greek form, . Pronunciation In clusters such as ps-, pn-, and gn- which are not allowed by English phonotactics, the usual English pronunciation drops the first consonant (e.g., psychology) at the start of a word; compare gnostic [nɒstɪk] and agnostic [ægnɒstɪk]; there are a few exceptions: tmesis [t(ə)miːsɪs]. Initial x- is pronounced z. Ch is pronounced like k rather than as in \\"church\\": e.g., character, chaos. The consecutive vowel letters 'ea' are generally pronounced separately rather than forming a single vowel sound when transcribing a Greek εα, which was not a digraph, but simply a sequence of two vowels with hiatus, as in genealogy or pancreas (cf., however, ocean, ωκεανός); the 'ea' in zeal comes irregularly from the η in ζήλος. Some sound sequences in English are only found in borrowings from Greek, notably initial sequences of two fricatives, as in sphere. Most initial /z/ sounds are found in Greek borrowings.Hickey, Raymond. \\"Phonological change in English.\\" In The Cambridge Handbook of English Historical Linguistics 12.10, edited by M. Kytö and P. Pahta. The stress on borrowings via Latin which keep their Latin form generally follows the traditional English pronunciation of Latin, which depends on the syllable structure in Latin, not in Greek. For example, in Greek, both ὑπόθεσις (hypothesis) and ἐξήγησις (exegesis) are accented on the antepenult, and indeed the penult has a long vowel in exegesis; but because the penult of Latin exegēsis is heavy by Latin rules, the accent falls on the penult in Latin and therefore in English. Inflectional endings and plurals Though many English words derived from Greek through the literary route drop the inflectional endings (tripod, zoology, pentagon) or use Latin endings (papyrus, mausoleum), some preserve the Greek endings: * -ον: phenomenon, criterion, neuron, lexicon; * -μα: plasma (-∅; cf. protoplasm), drama, dilemma, trauma; * -ος: chaos, ethos, asbestos, pathos, cosmos; * -ς: climax (ξ x = k + s), helix, larynx, eros, pancreas, atlas; * -η: catastrophe, agape, psyche; * -ις: analysis, basis, crisis, emphasis; * ης: diabetes, herpes, isosceles. In cases like scene, zone, fame, though the Greek words ended in -η, the silent English e is not derived from it. In the case of Greek endings, the plurals sometimes follow the Greek rules: phenomenon, phenomena; tetrahedron, tetrahedra; crisis, crises; hypothesis, hypotheses; polis, poleis; stigma, stigmata; topos, topoi; cyclops, cyclopes; but often do not: colon, colons not *cola (except for the very rare technical term of rhetoric); pentathlon, pentathlons not *pentathla; demon, demons not *demones; climaxes, not . Usage is mixed in some cases: schema, schemas or schemata; lexicon, lexicons or lexica; helix, helixes or helices; sphinx, sphinges or sphinxes; clitoris, clitorises or clitorides. And there are misleading cases: pentagon comes from Greek pentagonon, so its plural cannot be ; it is pentagons—the Greek form would be *pentagona (cf. Plurals from Latin and Greek). Verbs A few dozen English verbs are derived from the corresponding Greek verbs; examples are baptize, blame and blaspheme, stigmatize, ostracize, and cauterize. In addition, the Greek verbal suffix -ize is productive in Latin, the Romance languages, and English: words like metabolize, though composed of a Greek root and a Greek suffix, are modern compounds. A few of these also existed in Ancient Greek, such as crystallize, characterize, and democratize, but were probably coined independently in modern languages. This is particularly clear in cases like allegorize and synergize, where the Greek verbs ἀλληγορεῖν and συνεργεῖν do not end in -ize at all. Some English verbs with ultimate Greek etymologies, like pause and cycle, were formed as denominal verbs in English, even though there are corresponding Greek verbs, παῦειν/παυσ- and κυκλεῖν. Borrowings and cognates Greek and English share many Indo-European cognates. In some cases, the cognates can be confused with borrowings. For example, the English mouse is cognate with Greek μῦς /mys/ and Latin mūs, all from an Indo-European word *mūs; they are not borrowings. Similarly, acre is cognate to Latin ager and Greek αγρός, but not a borrowing; the prefix agro- is a borrowing from Greek, and the prefix agri- a borrowing from Latin. Phrases Many Latin phrases are used verbatim in English texts—et cetera (etc.), ad nauseam, modus operandi (M.O.), ad hoc, in flagrante delicto, mea culpa, and so on—but this is rarer for Greek phrases or expressions: * hoi polloi, the many' * eureka, 'I have found [it]' * kalos kagathos, 'beautiful and virtuous' * hapax legomenon, 'once said' * kyrie eleison, 'Lord, have mercy' Calques and translations Greek technical terminology was often calqued in Latin rather than borrowed,Fruyt, Michèle. \\"Latin Vocabulary.\\" In A Companion to the Latin Language, edited by J. Clackson. p. 152.Eleanor Detreville, \\"An Overview of Latin Morphological Calques on Greek Technical Terms: Formation and Success\\", M.A. thesis, University of Georgia, 2015, full text and then borrowed from Latin into English. Examples include: * (grammatical) case, from Latin casus ('an event', something that has fallen'), a semantic calque of Greek πτώσις ('a fall'); * nominative, from Latin nōminātīvus, a translation of Greek ὀνομαστική; * adverb, a morphological calque of Greek ἐπίρρημα as ad- + verbum; * magnanimous, from Greek μεγάθυμος (lit. 'great spirit'); * essence, from Latin essentia, which was constructed from the notional present participle *essens, imitating Greek οὐσία.Joseph Owens, Étienne Henry Gilson, The Doctrine of Being in the Aristotelian Metaphysics, 1963, p. 140 * Substance, from Latin substantia, a calque of Greek υπόστασις (cf. hypostasis);F.A.C. Mantello, Medieval Latin, 1996, , p. 276 * Cicero coined moral on analogy with Greek ηθικός.Wilhelm Wundt et al., Ethics: An Investigation of the Facts and Laws of the Moral Life, 1897, p. 1:26 * Recant is modeled on παλινῳδεῖν.A.J. Woodman, \\"O MATRE PVLCHRA: The Logical Iambist: To the memory of Niall Rudd\\", The Classical Quarterly 68:1:192-198 (May 2018) , footnote 26 Greek phrases were also calqued in Latin, then borrowed or translated into English: * commonplace is an English calque of the Latin locus communis, itself a calque of Greek κοινός τόπος. * Latin: deus ex machina (‘god out of the machine’) was calqued from the Greek apò mēkhanês theós (ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός). * materia medica is a short form of Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, the Latin translation of Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς. * quod erat demonstrandum (Q.E.D.) is a calque of ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι. * subject matter is a calque of Latin subiecta māteria, itself a calque of Aristotle's phrase \\"ἡ ὑποκειμένη ὕλη.\\" * wisdom tooth came to English from Latin dentes sapientiae, from Arabic aḍrāsu 'lḥikmi, from Greek σωϕρονιστῆρες, used by Hippocrates. * political animal is from Greek πολιτικὸν ζῷον (in Aristotle's Politics). * quintessence is post-classical Latin quinta essentia, from Greek πέμπτη οὐσία. The Greek word εὐαγγέλιον has come into English both in borrowed forms like evangelical and the form gospel, an English calque (Old English: gód spel, 'good tidings') of Latin bona adnuntiatio, itself a calque of the Greek. Statistics The contribution of Greek to the English vocabulary can be quantified in two ways, type and token frequencies: type frequency is the proportion of distinct words; token frequency is the proportion of words in actual texts. Since most words of Greek origin are specialized technical and scientific coinages, the type frequency is considerably higher than the token frequency. And the type frequency in a large word list will be larger than that in a small word list. In a typical English dictionary of 80,000 words, which corresponds very roughly to the vocabulary of an educated English speaker, about 5% of the words are borrowed from Greek.Scheler, Manfred. 1977. Der englische Wortschatz. Berlin: Schmidt. =Most common= Of the 500 most common words in English, 18 are of Greek origin: place (rank 115), problem (121), school (147), system (180), program (241), idea (252), story (307), base (328), center (335), period (383), history (386), type (390), music (393), political (395), policy (400), paper (426), phone (480), economic (494).New General Service List, See also *List of Greek and Latin roots in English *List of Greek morphemes used in English *List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names *Transliteration of Greek into English *Classical compound *Hybrid word *Latin influence in English References = Citations = =Sources= * Gaidatzi, Theopoula.

Background The Funk Brothers recorded and performed on Motowns' recordings from 1959 to 1972. The film was inspired by the 1989 book Standing in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson, a bass guitar instruction book by Allan Slutsky, which features a biography of James Jamerson along with his bass lines. The film covers the Funk Brothers' career via interviews with surviving band members, archival footage and still photos, dramatized re-enactments, and narration by actor Andre Braugher. The film also features new live performances of several Motown hit songs, with the Funk Brothers backing up Gerald Levert, Me'shell Ndegeocello, Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins, Chaka Khan, and Montell Jordan. The impetus behind making the film was to bring these influential players out of anonymity. In addition to bassist James Jamerson, The Funk Brothers consisted of the following musicians: Jack Ashford (percussion); Bob Babbitt (bass); Joe Hunter (keyboards); Uriel Jones (drums); Joe Messina (guitar); Eddie Willis (guitar); Richard \\"Pistol\\" Allen (drums); Benny \\"Papa Zita\\" Benjamin (drums); Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown (percussion); Johnny Griffith (keyboards); Earl Van Dyke (keyboards); and Robert White (guitar). The Funk Brothers produced more hits than The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and Elvis Presley combined. It was their sound, according to Mary Wilson (of The Supremes), that backed The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Mary Wells, among other noteworthy bands during their tenure from 1959 to 1973.

After duty in the Adriatic and Mediterranean she returned to the United States, and served on both the east and west coasts until 1924 when she was selected as a tender for the rigid airship A mooring mast some 125 feet above the water was constructed; additional accommodations both for the crew of Shenandoah and for the men who handled and supplied the airship were added; facilities for the helium, gasoline, and other supplies necessary for Shenandoah were built; as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes. This work by the Norfolk Navy Yard was completed shortly after 1 July 1924. Patoka retained her classification of AO–9. Patoka engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with the Shenandoah, which had reported to the Commander, Scouting Fleet, for duty on 1 August 1924. The first successful mooring was made on 8 August 1924. In October, Patoka, along with the cruisers and , were assigned stations in the mid-Atlantic to furnish the US Navy's second operational airship, , with the weather reports and forecasts during her flight, 12 to 15 October 1924, from Germany, where she had been built, to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey. During 1925 Patoka operated with both Shenandoah and Los Angeles in demonstrating the mobility of airships, and in reducing the number of ground personnel required to handle them. A projected polar flight by Shenandoah, using Patoka as her base of operations, was cancelled when the airship was lost in a storm on 3 September 1925. Between 1925 and 1932 Patoka operated with Los Angeles and served as her base of supply and operations on her long-range flights to Puerto Rico (1925), Panama (1928), Florida (1929), and during the fleet concentration off Panama (1931). During 1932 she also operated with the newly acquired airship , but the decommissioning of Los Angeles on 30 June 1932, and the loss of Akron on 4 April 1933 saw a reduced need for an airship tender, with Patoka decommissioned on 31 August 1933. On 10 November 1939 Patoka recommissioned at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Comdr. C.A.F. Sprague in command, and reported to Patrol Wing 5, Aircraft, Scouting Force. Her classification had been changed to AV–6, seaplane tender, on 11 October 1939. On 18 January 1940 she departed Puget Sound and, after taking on fuel and cargo at San Pedro, arrived at San Diego on the 31st. She steamed for the east coast on 5 February and reached Norfolk on 25 March. Next Patoka was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service in June and was reclassified AO–9 on 19 June 1940. On 13 August she departed Norfolk and sailed to Houston. Between August and December 1940, she operated out of Houston and Baytown, Texas, delivering fuel oil to Boston, Melville, Norfolk, Charleston, and Key West. From March 1941 to September Patoka delivered fuel oil and general cargo to various units of the Fleet in the Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean areas. On 28 September she departed Norfolk and proceeded, via Aruba, to Recife, Brazil. Patoka made one more round trip to Recife before the United States entered World War II. World War II, 1941–1943 On 7 December 1941, Patoka was moored at Recife, acting as tanker, cargo, store ship, and repair ship. Here she supplied the units of Task Force 3 (later 23) with fuel, diesel, lubricating oil; gasoline stores; provisions; and repairs. Shortly after the turn of the new year 1942, she got under way for Bahia, Brazil, anchoring there on 8 January. There, she received word that ships bearing rubber and other vital war goods had left French Indochina bound for the Axis controlled ports in Europe. Patoka requested and received permission to patrol the shipping lanes off Bahia. When she had completed her patrol duties she put into port and returned to Recife on 22 January. Six days later she was bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, but en route she was diverted to Trinidad, BWI. Taking on fuel and stores she returned to Recife. Standing out of the harbor on 21 February, she again set course, changed several times to avoid reported submarines, and reached San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 4 March. Her return trip to Recife was made without incident. On 25 May 1942, while again returning to Recife from Trinidad escorted by , Patoka sighted an enemy submarine on the surface. Jouett attacked, forcing the U-boat to dive and continued the attack until Patoka had escaped. Patoka remained at Recife, continuing to supply the ships of Task Force 23 with provisions, supplies and tender services until April 1943, with occasional trips to Puerto Rico and Trinidad for replenishment. Patoka then got underway for home, reaching Norfolk on 22 May for overhaul. She sailed for New York on 6 August to join a convoy bound for Aruba, N.W.I. and resumed operations along the coast of South America. 1944–1945 In April 1944, she carried 62 prisoners of war (German naval and merchant marine personnel) from Rio de Janeiro to Recife where they were turned over to the U.S. Army. Patoka departed on 24 March and arrived Norfolk on 6 April for an overhaul period, to prepare for duty in the Pacific. On 15 June, Patoka departed from Norfolk for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor. There she was outfitted for duty as a minecraft tender and was reclassified AG–125 on 15 August 1945. Shortly thereafter she sailed via Guam for Okinawa, reaching Buckner Bay on 5 September. Patoka provided the minecraft with tender services until 21 September at which time she got underway for Wakayama, Japan. Anchoring there on 23 September, she continued to provide logistic support to units of the 5th Fleet, servicing mine vessels of Task Group 52.6. She remained with the occupation forces until the spring of 1946, returning to the United States on 10 March 1946. Fate Patoka was decommissioned on 1 July 1946, transferred to the War Shipping Administration, and was struck from the Navy List on 31 July 1946. She was sold to Dulien Steel Products Co. for scrap on 15 March 1948.

A mashgiach may supervise any type of food service establishment, including slaughterhouses, food manufacturers, hotels, caterers, nursing homes, restaurants, butchers, groceries, or cooperatives. The mashgiach usually works as the on-site supervisor and inspector, representing a kosher certification agency or a local rabbi, who actually makes the policy decisions for what is or is not acceptably kosher. Sometimes the certifying rabbi (, Rav Hamachshir) acts as his own mashgiach; such is the case in many small communities. Requirements The requirements for becoming a mashgiach are being Jewish, being Sabbath-observant (shomer Shabbat), being Torah-observant (shomer mitzvot), and personally fulfilling the laws of kashrut (shomer kashrut). According to Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon, a senior Orthodox rabbi in the United States, the most important criterion is yirat Shamayim (fear of Heaven). Many AKO (Association of Kashrus Organizations) member organizations worldwide require a Mashgiach to complete the AKO Mashgiach Course, created by Kosher Institute of America, and obtain a Mashgiach ID Card as a prerequisite to working as a Mashgiach. A mashgiach takes on a great responsibility and the burden of a community. The mashgiach puts his good name and the name of the community on everything done on his watch. =Gender= Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has permitted a woman to serve as a mashgicha (feminine form of mashgiach). Although the majority of mashgichim are men, most supervising agencies employ women in this role as well. Responsibilities Depending on the assignment, the mashgiach must be familiar with the halakhas of slaughtering meat, cooking meat and fish, and separating meat and dairy. He must be knowledgeable about the way boilers and shipping vessels work, since high temperatures and long storage times can affect the status of kosher foods. It has been said that in addition to knowledge of Jewish law, a mashgiach must be familiar with \\"engineering, entomology, metallurgy, boiler treatment, food chemistry, and world market trends\\". A mashgiach is required whenever meat or fish is prepared or cooked. They check fresh eggs for blood spots before they are used in cooking, and must inspect all vegetables for forbidden insects before use. The mashgiach is responsible for performing the mitzvah of challah, the tithe of dough set aside for consumption by a kohen. (Some perform this in the diaspora, whereas in Israel it is always burnt.) The mashgiach must also light pilot lights and turn on cooking and heating equipment to satisfy minimum requirements of bishul Yisroel (food cooked by a Jew) and pas Yisroel (bread baked by a Jew), in a way that a Jew must be involved in the cooking of any kosher food \\"fit for a king's table.\\" the Mashgiach must light the boiler To satisfy requirements for Sephardic Jews, the mashgiah may be required to play an even more active role in the cooking process. Often, a primary responsibility of a Mashgiach is washing and inspecting produce to ensure there is no infestation. The skill of inspecting produce properly requires much training and expertise. One of the most pressing jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher (certification) before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products that are out of stock with non- kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine. Great strides, in the last several years, have been made towards ensuring that kosher products are transported only in kosher approved tanker trucks. In many settings, the mashgiach is merely responsible for making sure that the above tasks are performed by responsible, knowledgeable, and well-trained persons. A mashgiach plays social as well as technical roles in explaining kosher rules to the Jewish and non-Jewish community and forging close relationships with employees and customers.A Mashgiach's Job is Never Done Retrieved 2018-04-27.

The legends about Daedalus recognize him both as a man and as a mythical embodiment. He was the reputed inventor of agalmata, statues of the gods which had open eyes and moveable limbs, a compelling manifestation of the mystery of divinity (the verb \\"to see\\" was reciprocal in Greek: whoever saw was also seen, and the blind were invisible). These statues were so lifelike that Plato remarked upon their amazing and disconcerting mobility, which was accomplished with techniques that are clearly those of the \\"daidala\\". The writer Pausanias thought that wooden images were referred to as \\"daidala\\" even before Daedalus’s time. The name \\"Daedalus\\", more specifically, has been suggested by Alberto Pérez-Gómez to be a play on the Greek word \\"daidala\\" which appears in archaic literature as a complement of the verb \\"to make\\", \\"to manufacture\\", \\"to forge\\", \\"to weave\\", \\"to place on\\", or \\"to see\\". Daidala were the implements of early society: defensive works, arms, furniture, and so forth. Daedalic sculpture reveals Eastern influences, known as Orientalizing Period in Greek art. Orientalizing is particularly noticeable in the head seen from the front; it resembles an Eastern head, with wiglike hair, but is more angular, having a triangular face, large eyes, and a prominent nose. Furthermore, the hair usually forms two upward-facing triangles on either side of the face. The female body is rather flatly geometric, with high waist and formless drapery. Early sculpture exhibiting these attributes is known as \\"Daedalic\\"; it was used for figurines, on clay plaques, and in relief decorations on vases. It seems to have had a marked influence in the Peloponnese, Dorian Crete, and Rhodes. Its style is based on a simple formula which remained dominant, though with evolutionary modifications, for about two generations, before evolving into the Archaic style.

The term is the opposite of an incumbent politician who repeatedly defends their seats successfully. Perennial candidates can vary widely in nature. Some are independents who lack the support of the major political parties in an area or are members of alternative parties (such as third parties in the United States). Others may be mainstream candidates who can consistently win a party's nomination, but because their district is gerrymandered or a natural safe seat for another party, the candidate likewise never gets elected (thus these types are often paper candidates). Still, others may typically run in primary elections for a party's nomination and lose repeatedly. Numerous perennial candidates, although not all, run with the full knowledge of their inability to win elections and instead use their candidacy for satire, to advance non- mainstream political platforms, or to take advantage of benefits afforded political candidates (such as campaign financing, name recognition, and television advertising benefits).

His best performance was in 2011, with 2.30% of the votes. =Brazil= Due to the complex and intricate political system in Brazil concerning political parties, there are more than 30 political parties. In this scenario, it is very useful to have hopeless candidates who can make a good number of votes and increase the overall votes count of a party (or coalition). As a consequence, there are thousands of small perennial candidates for local elections around the country, whose sole purpose is helping others get elected, then ask for a job in the elected government cabinet. *Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ran for President of Brazil in 1989, 1994 and 1998, ranking second on each occasion. He ultimately won by landslide in 2002, and was re-elected in 2006. *José Maria Eymael, a fringe political figure, ran for the Presidency five times (1998, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018); he failed to reach 1% of the votes in any of those.

In her best results, she had numbers of votes in local Porto Alegre elections similar to those of lesser-voted elected candidates but did not get a seat due to her party's overall voting being small. PSTU traditionally enters elections with no visible chance to, allegedly, \\"put a leftist set of points in discussion\\" and \\"build the party\\" but has lately achieved some expressive numbers. *Enéas Carneiro, a cardiologist and founder of the far-right Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order (PRONA), ran for presidency 3 times, in 1989, 1994 and 1998.

The war lasted from 104 BC until 100 BC. Background The Consul Gaius Marius was recruiting soldiers for the war against the Cimbri and Teutones in the North. He requested support from King Nicomedes III of Bithynia near the Roman province of Asia, and was refused, on the grounds that every able-bodied man in Bithynia had been enslaved by Roman tax-gatherers for being unable to pay their dues. The Senate replied by issuing orders that no slaves were to be taken from among allies of Rome, and that all such slaves should be immediately freed.A. H. Beesely, The Gracchi, Marius, and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History, (Kindle edition), ch. VI., p. 57 The propraetor Publius Licinius Nerva, in obedience to the edict, at once freed around 800 slaves in his province of Sicily; aside from awakening discontent among slaves from other nationalities who were not freed, this had the effect of alienating the rich Sicilian plantation owners who saw their human chattel unceremoniously being taken out of their hands. Alarmed, Nerva revoked the sentence of manumission (the freeing of the slaves), which provoked the slave population into revolt. Salvius Tryphon Nerva failed to react with decision; by false promises he was able to return one body of the rebels to slavery, while neglecting to address a more serious outbreak near Heraclea. Eventually, Nerva dispatched a detachment of 600 soldiers to take care of the rebels near Heraclea but they were beaten and slaughtered; the slaves now gained confidence, having won a large supply of armaments and a strong leader, a former slave called Salvius. Taking the previous slave-leader Eunus for his example, who had proclaimed himself an Antiochus of the Seleucid line, he assumed the name Tryphon, from Diodotus Tryphon, a Seleucid ruler. After his victory, Salvius besieged the city of Morgantia. Nerva now marched against him with Sicily's militia but he was also defeated. The slaves then managed to take the city. After Morgantia, Salvius' slave army swelled to 2,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot. Meanwhile, another revolt had broken out in western Sicily; there Athenion, a Cilician slave with a career analogous to Cleon's, rose in revolt. He marched his slave army to join with Salvius upon hearing of the Morgantia victory. Lucullus In 103 BC the Senate sent the praetor Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who had just put down a revolt in Campania (the Vettian Revolt), to quell the rebellion. Lucullus, at the head of a 17,000 men strong Roman and Allied army, landed in western Sicily and marched on the rebel stronghold of Triocala.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 36.8. =The Battle of Scirthaea= When Salvius Tryphon, the Slave King, heard of Lucullus‘ arrival he wanted to hold out against the Romans inside Triocala. His general Athenion, however, persuaded him not to hide but instead face the Romans in open battle. Marching to meet Lucullus, the rebels encamped at Scirthaea, twelve miles distant from the Roman camp and, the next day, the two sides lined up for battle. According to Diodorus, Tryphon's host numbered around 40,000. After much skirmishing, the main battle began as the two armies closed the gap and came together. At first it seemed as if the rebels would drive the Romans back, with Athenion and his cavalry inflicting heavy losses upon Lucullus‘ flanks. However, just as it seemed that the slaves might be victorious, Athenion was wounded and fell from his horse. He was forced to feign death in order to save himself. The rebels, believing their general to be dead, lost heart and fled. Salvius Tryphon, seeing his army routed, turned and joined them in flight back to Triocala. Later that night, under cover of darkness, the wounded Athenion escaped the battlefield. With thousands of slaves cut down in the rout, Diodorus estimates that, as night fell, around 20,000 rebels lay dead, half of Tryphon's army. =The Siege of Triocala= After the battle, Lucullus slowly but surely worked his way to Triocala, restoring Roman Rule while he marched. At Triocala the rebels had dug in; Lucullus started a siege while waiting for his command to be extended, but when he heard that he had been replaced he spitefully ended the siege, burned his siegeworks, camp and provisions, retreated and disbanded his army.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 36.9. Lucullus did this to render the task harder for his successor, Gaius Servilius the Augur; Lucullus intended, by ensuring the failure of his successor, to prove his own innocence from any alleged incompetence.Mike Duncan, The Storm before the Storm, p. 140. Athenion In 102 BC Athenion, who had succeeded as slave-king after Salvius' death (he had passed after the earlier battle) was able to take Gaius Servilius's camp by surprise; Servilius' army was routed and dispersed, undoing all of Lucullus' previous success.A. H. Beesely, The Gracchi, Marius, and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History, VI, p. 58. The Revolt suppressed Finally, in 101 BC, the Roman consul Manius Aquillius was given the command against the insurgents in Sicily. The Senior Consul, Gaius Marius, donated several cohorts from his army in Gaul to Aquillius. With these and the troops he recruited, equipped and trained en route he succeeded in defeating Athenion's slave army upon arrival. He supposedly killed Athenion by his own hand. The revolt was quelled, and 1,000 slaves who surrendered were sent to fight against beasts in the arena back at Rome for the amusement of the populace. To spite the Romans, they refused to fight and killed each other quietly with their swords, until the last flung himself on his own blade. It was the second of a series of three slave revolts in the Roman Republic, but fueled by the same slave abuse in Sicily and Southern Italy.  Second Servile War in Literature  * F. L.

The Third was the only one directly to threaten the Roman heartland of Italy. It was particularly alarming to Rome because its military seemed powerless to suppress it. The revolt began in 73 BC, with the escape of around 70 slave-gladiators from a gladiator school in Capua; they easily defeated the small Roman force sent to recapture them. Within two years, they had been joined by some 120,000 men, women and children; the able-bodied adults of this band were a surprisingly effective armed force that repeatedly showed they could withstand or defeat the Roman military, from the local Campanian patrols, to the Roman militia and even to trained Roman legions under consular command. The slaves roamed across Italia, raiding estates and towns with relative impunity, sometimes dividing into separate but connected bands with several leaders, including the famous gladiator-general Spartacus. The Roman Senate grew increasingly alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded an army of eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus and the realization that the legions of Pompey and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian Way. Plutarch's account of the revolt suggests that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions and contributed to the development of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.  Background  To varying degrees throughout Roman history, the existence of a pool of inexpensive labor in the form of slaves was an important factor in the economy. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the enslavement of foreign populations through military conquest.Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Servus\\", p. 1038 ; details the legal and military means by which people were enslaved. With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands of slaves at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Servus\\", p. 1040; Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 2:33. Smith refers to the purchase of 10,000 slaves from Cilician pirates, while Caesar provides an example of the enslavement of 53,000 captive Aduatuci by a Roman army. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers of slaves worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of Sicily and southern Italy.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Servus\\", p. 1039; Livy, The History of Rome, 6:12 For the most part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not considered a person, but property. Owners could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades who worked in the fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Servus\\", pp. 1022–39 summarizes the complex body of Roman law pertaining to the legal status of slaves. This high concentration and oppressive treatment of the slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found tens of thousands of willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.  Beginning of the revolt (73 BC)  = Capuan revolt = The Gladiator Mosaic at the Galleria Borghese In the Roman Republic of the 1st century BC, gladiatorial games were one of the more popular forms of entertainment. In order to supply gladiators for the contests, several training schools, or ludi, were established throughout Italy.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Gladiatores\\", p. 574. In these schools, prisoners of war and condemned criminals—who were considered slaves—were taught the skills required to fight in gladiatorial games.Mommsen, The History of Rome, 3233–3238. In 73 BC, a group of some 200 gladiators in the Capuan school owned by Lentulus Batiatus plotted an escape. When their plot was betrayed, a force of about 70 men seized kitchen implements (\\"choppers and spits\\"), fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.Plutarch, Crassus, 8:1–2; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Livy, Periochae, 95:2; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Plutarch claims 78 escaped, Livy claims 74, Appian \\"about seventy\\", and Florus says \\"thirty or rather more men\\". \\"Choppers and spits\\" is from Life of Crassus. Once free, the escaped gladiators chose leaders from their number, selecting two Gallic slaves—Crixus and Oenomaus—and Spartacus, who was said either to be a Thracian auxiliary from the Roman legions later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Plutarch, Crassus, 8:2. Note: Spartacus' status as an auxilia is taken from the Loeb edition of Appian translated by Horace White, which states \\"... who had once served as a soldier with the Romans ...\\". However, the translation by John Carter in the Penguin Classics version reads: \\"... who had once fought against the Romans and after being taken prisoner and sold ...\\". There is some question as to Spartacus's nationality. A Thraex was a type of gladiator in Rome, so \\"Thracian\\" may simply refer to the style of gladiatorial combat in which he was trained.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Gladiatores\\", p. 576. On the other hand, names nearly identical to Spartacus were recorded among five out of twenty Thracian Odrysae rulers of Bosporan kingdom beginning with Spartokos I the founder of the Spartocid dynasty. The name probably meant \\"Spear bearer\\" (Spar-spear, tokos-bearer) in the Thracian language. These escaped slaves were able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip themselves with captured military equipment as well as their gladiatorial weapons.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Florus, Epitome, 2.8; – Florus and Appian make the claim that the slaves withdrew to Vesuvius, while Plutarch only mentions \\"a hill\\" in the account of Glaber's siege of the slave's encampment. = Defeat of the praetorian armies = Initial movements of Roman (red) and Slave (blue) forces from the Capuan revolt to the end of winter 73–72 BC. Insert: Vesuvius area. As the revolt and raids were occurring in Campania, which was a vacation region of the rich and influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly came to the attention of Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt as more a major crime wave than an armed rebellion. However, later that year, Rome dispatched a military force under praetorian authority to put down the rebellion.Note: while there seems to be consensus as to the general history of the praetorian expeditions, the names of the commanders and subordinates of these forces varies widely based on the historical account. A Roman praetor, Gaius Claudius Glaber, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not regular legions, but a militia \\"picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery.\\"Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116. Glaber's forces besieged the slaves on Mount Vesuvius, blocking the only known way down the mountain. With the slaves thus contained, Glaber was content to wait until starvation forced the slaves to surrender. While the slaves lacked military training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity in their use of available local tools, and in their use of clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman infantry.Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22 and Book VII:6. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs on the side of the mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1–3; Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, p. 109. Note: Plutarch and Frontinus write of expeditions under the command of \\"Clodius the praetor\\" and \\"Publius Varinus\\", while Appian writes of \\"Varinius Glaber\\" and \\"Publius Valerius\\". A second expedition, under the praetor Publius Varinius, was then dispatched against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius seems to have split his forces under the command of his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:4–5; Livy, Periochae , 95; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Sallust, Histories, 3:64–67. With these victories, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did \\"many of the herdsmen and shepherds of the region\\", swelling their ranks to some 70,000.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:3; Appian, Civil War, 1:116. Livy identifies the second commander as \\"Publius Varenus\\" with the subordinate \\"Claudius Pulcher\\". The rebel slaves spent the winter of 73–72 BC training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of Nola, Nuceria, Thurii and Metapontum.Florus, Epitome, 2.8. The victories of the rebel slaves did not come without a cost. At some time during these events, one of their leaders, Oenomaus, was lost—presumably in battle—and is not mentioned further in the histories.Orosius, Histories 5.24.2; Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion, p.96.  Motivation and leadership of the escaped slaves  Spartacus, by Denis Foyatier, c. 1830, displayed at the Louvre. An example of a modern heroic depiction of Spartacus. By the end of 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were in command of a large group of armed men with a proven ability to withstand Roman armies. What they intended to do with this force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories. Many popular modern accounts of the war claim that there was a factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:7; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117. This indicates the existence of two groups: Lucius Gellius eventually attacked Crixus and a group of some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:5–6. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there does not seem to be any direct evidence to support it. Fictional accounts sometimes portray the rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling to change a corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions that the goal of the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery. Even classical historians, who were writing only years after the events themselves, seem to be divided as to what the motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write that he intended to march on Rome itselfAppian, Civil Wars, 1:117; Florus, Epitome, 2.8.—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes. It is not certain that the slaves were a homogeneous group under the leadership of Spartacus, although this is implied by the Roman historians. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.  Defeat of the consular armies (72 BC)  The events of 72 BC, according to Appian's version of events In the spring of 72 BC, the escaped slaves left their winter encampments and began to move northwards towards Cisalpine Gaul. The Senate, alarmed by the size of the revolt and the defeat of the praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, dispatched a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116–117; Plutarch, Crassus 9:6; Sallust, Histories, 3:64–67. Initially, the consular armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117; Plutarch, Crassus 9:7; Livy, Periochae 96. Livy reports that troops under the (former) praetor Quintus Arrius killed Crixus and 20,000 of his followers. At this point, there is a divergence in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account. = Appian's history = According to Appian, the battle between Gellius' legions and Crixus' men near Mount Garganus was the beginning of a long and complex series of military maneuvers that almost resulted in the Spartacan forces directly assaulting the city of Rome itself. After his victory over Crixus, Gellius moved northwards, following the main group of slaves under Spartacus who were heading for Cisalpine Gaul. The army of Lentulus was deployed to bar Spartacus' path, and the consuls hoped to trap the rebel slaves between them. Spartacus' army met Lentulus' legion, defeated it, turned, and destroyed Gellius' army, forcing the Roman legions to retreat in disarray.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117. Appian claims that Spartacus executed some 300 captured Roman soldiers to avenge the death of Crixus, forcing them to fight each other to the death as gladiators.Appian, Civil war, 1.117; Florus, Epitome, 2.8; Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion, p.121; Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Gladiatores\\", p.574. – Note that gladiator contests as part of some funeral rituals in the Roman Republic were a high honor, according to Smith. This accords with Florus' passage \\"He also celebrated the obsequies of his officers who had fallen in battle with funerals like those of Roman generals, and ordered his captives to fight at their pyres\\". Following this victory, Spartacus pushed northwards with his followers (some 120,000) as fast as he could travel, \\"having burned all his useless material, killed all his prisoners, and butchered his pack-animals in order to expedite his movement\\". The defeated consular armies fell back to Rome to regroup while Spartacus' followers moved northward. The consuls again engaged Spartacus somewhere in the Picenum region, and once again were defeated. Appian claims that at this point Spartacus changed his intention of marching on Rome—implying this was Spartacus' goal following the confrontation in PicenumAppian, Civil war, 1.117; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Florus does not detail when and how Spartacus intended to march on Rome, but agrees this was Spartacus' ultimate goal.—as \\"he did not consider himself ready as yet for that kind of a fight, as his whole force was not suitably armed, for no city had joined him, but only slaves, deserters, and riff-raff\\", and decided to withdraw into southern Italy once again. They seized the town of Thurii and the surrounding countryside, arming themselves, raiding the surrounding territories, trading plunder with merchants for bronze and iron (with which to manufacture more arms), and clashing occasionally with Roman forces which were invariably defeated. = Plutarch's history = The events of 72 BC, according to Plutarch's version of events Plutarch's description of events differs significantly from Appian's. According to Plutarch, after the battle between Gellius' legion and Crixus's men (whom Plutarch describes as \\"Germans\\"Plutarch, Crassus, 9:7.) near Mount Garganus, Spartacus' men engaged the legion commanded by Lentulus, defeated them, seized their supplies and equipment, and pushed directly into northern Italy. After this defeat, both consuls were relieved of command of their armies by the Roman Senate and recalled to Rome.Plutarch, Crassus 10:1;. Plutarch does not mention Spartacus engaging Gellius' legion at all, nor of Spartacus facing the combined consular legions in Picenum. Plutarch then goes on to detail a conflict not mentioned in Appian's history. According to Plutarch, Spartacus' army continued northwards to the region around Mutina (modern Modena). There, a Roman army of some 10,000 soldiers, led by the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Gaius Cassius Longinus attempted to bar Spartacus' progress and was also defeated.Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion, p. 96; Plutarch, Crassus 9:7; Livy, Periochae , 96:6. – Bradley identifies Gaius Cassius Longinus as the governor of Cisalpine Gaul at the time. Livy also identifies \\"Caius Cassius\\" and mentions his co-commander (or sub-commander?) \\"Cnaeus Manlius\\". Plutarch makes no further mention of events until the initial confrontation between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus in the spring of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC. Why they might do so, when there was apparently no reason for them not to escape over the Alps—Spartacus' goal according to PlutarchPlutarch, Crassus, 9:5.—is not explained.  The war under Crassus (71 BC)  The events of early 71 BC. Marcus Licinius Crassus takes command of the Roman legions, confronts Spartacus, and forces the rebel slaves to retreat through Lucania to the straits near Messina. Plutarch says this occurred in the Picenum region, while Appian places the initial battles between Crassus and Spartacus in the Samnium region. Despite the contradictions in the classical sources regarding the events of 72 BC, there seems to be general agreement that Spartacus and his followers were in the south of Italy in early 71 BC. = Crassus takes command of the legions = The Senate, now alarmed at the apparently unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave the task of putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus was no stranger to Roman politics, or to military command as he had been a field commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the second civil war between Sulla and the Marian faction in 82 BC, and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.Plutarch, Crassus, 6; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:76–1:104. Plutarch gives a brief synopsis of Crassus's involvement in the war, with 6:6–7 showing an example of Crassus as an effective commander. Appian gives a much more detailed account of the entire war and subsequent dictatorship, in which Crassus's actions are mentioned throughout. Crassus was given a praetorship, and assigned six new legions in addition to the two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions).Appian, Civil Wars, 1:118; Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Exercitus\\", p.494; Appian details the number of legions, while Smith discusses the size of the legions throughout the Roman civilization, stating that late republican legions varied from 5,000–6,200 men per legion. Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).Appian, Civil Wars, 1:118. Plutarch only mentions the decimation of 50 legionaries of one cohort as punishment after Mummius' defeat in the first confrontation between Crassus and Spartacus.Plutarch, Crassus, 10:1–3. Regardless of what actually occurred, Crassus' treatment of his legions proved that \\"he was more dangerous to them than the enemy\\", and spurred them on to victory rather than running the risk of displeasing their commander. = Crassus and Spartacus = When the forces of Spartacus moved northwards once again, Crassus deployed six of his legions on the borders of the region (Plutarch claims the initial battle between Crassus' legions and Spartacus' followers occurred near the Picenum region, Appian claims it occurred near the region of SamniumAppian, Civil Wars, 1:119.), and detached two legions under his legate, Mummius, to maneuver behind Spartacus, but gave them orders not to engage the rebels. When an opportunity presented itself, Mummius disobeyed, attacked the Spartacan forces, and was subsequently routed. Despite this initial loss, Crassus engaged Spartacus and defeated him, killing some 6,000 of the rebels. The tide seemed to have turned in the war. Crassus' legions were victorious in several engagements, killing thousands of the rebel slaves, and forcing Spartacus to retreat south through Lucania to the straits near Messina. According to Plutarch, Spartacus made a bargain with Cilician pirates to transport him and some 2,000 of his men to Sicily, where he intended to incite a slave revolt and gather reinforcements. However, he was betrayed by the pirates, who took payment and then abandoned the rebel slaves. Minor sources mention that there were some attempts at raft and shipbuilding by the rebels as a means to escape, but that Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure the rebels could not cross to Sicily, and their efforts were abandoned.Florus, Epitome, 2.8; Cicero, Orations, \\"For Quintius, Sextus Roscius ...\\", 5.2 Spartacus' forces then retreated towards Rhegium. Crassus' legions followed and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The rebels were under siege and cut off from their supplies.Plutarch, Crassus, 10:4–5. = The end of the war = The last events of the war in 71 BC, where the army of Spartacus broke the siege by Crassus' legions and retreated toward the mountains near Petelia. Shows the initial skirmishes between elements of the two sides, the turn-about of the Spartacan forces for the final confrontation. Note the legions of Pompey moving in from the north to capture survivors. At this time, the legions of Pompey were returning to Italy, having put down the rebellion of Quintus Sertorius in Hispania. Sources disagree on whether Crassus had requested reinforcements, or whether the Senate simply took advantage of Pompey's return to Italy, but Pompey was ordered to bypass Rome and head south to aid Crassus.Contrast Plutarch, Crassus, 11:2 with Appian, Civil Wars, 1:119. The Senate also sent reinforcements under the command of \\"Lucullus\\", mistakenly thought by Appian to be Lucius Licinius Lucullus, commander of the forces engaged in the Third Mithridatic War at the time, but who appears to have been the proconsul of Macedonia, Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, the former's younger brother.Strachan-Davidson on Appian. 1.120; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:2. With Pompey's legions marching out of the north, and Lucullus' troops landing in Brundisium, Crassus realized that if he did not put down the slave revolt quickly, credit for the war would go to the general who arrived with reinforcements, and thus he spurred his legions on to end the conflict quickly.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:2. Hearing of the approach of Pompey, Spartacus tried to negotiate with Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120. When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces broke out of confinement and fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern Strongoli) in Bruttium, with Crassus' legions in pursuit.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 10:6. No mention of the fate of the forces who did not break out of the siege is mentioned, although it is possible that these were the slaves under command of Gannicus and Castus mentioned later. The legions managed to catch a portion of the rebels – under the command of Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.Plutarch, Crassus, 11:3; Livy, Periochae, 97:1. Plutarch gives the figure 12,300 rebels killed. Livy claims 35,000. Even though Spartacus had lost significant numbers of men, Crassus' legions had also suffered greatly. The Roman forces under the command of a cavalry officer named Lucius Quinctius were destroyed when some of the escaped slaves turned to meet them.Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion. p. 97; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:4. The rebel slaves were not a professional army, and had reached their limit. They were unwilling to flee any farther, and groups of men were breaking away from the main force to independently attack the oncoming legions of Crassus.Plutarch, Crassus, 11:5;. With discipline breaking down, Spartacus turned his forces around and brought his entire strength to bear on the oncoming legions. In this last stand, the Battle of the Silarius River, Spartacus' forces were finally routed completely, with the vast majority of them being killed on the battlefield.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:6–7; Livy, Periochae, 97.1. Livy claims some 60,000 rebel slaves killed in this final action. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield. However, his body was never found.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Florus, Epitome, 2.8.  Aftermath  The Fall of Spartacus The rebellion of the Third Servile War was annihilated by Crassus. Although Pompey's forces did not directly engage Spartacus's forces at any time, his legions moving in from the north were able to capture some 5,000 rebels fleeing the battle, \\"all of whom he slew\\".Matyszak, The Enemies of Rome p.133; Plutarch, Pompey, 21:2, Crassus 11.7. After this action, Pompey sent a dispatch to the Senate, saying that while Crassus certainly had conquered the slaves in open battle, he himself had ended the war, thus claiming a large portion of the credit and earning the enmity of Crassus.Plutarch, Crassus, 11.7. While most of the rebel slaves were killed on the battlefield, some 6,000 survivors were captured by the legions of Crassus. All 6,000 were crucified along the Appian Way from Rome to Capua. Pompey and Crassus reaped political benefit for having put down the rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or quaestor.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:121. Nonetheless, both men were elected consul for 70 BC,Appian, Civil Wars, 1:121; Plutarch, Crassus, 12:2. partly due to the implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.Fagan, The History of Ancient Rome; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:121. The effects of the Third Servile War on Roman attitudes towards slavery, and on the institution of slavery in Rome, are harder to determine. Certainly the revolt had shaken the Roman people, who \\"out of sheer fear seem to have begun to treat their slaves less harshly than before.\\"Davis, Readings in Ancient History, p.90 The wealthy owners of the latifundia began to reduce the number of agricultural slaves, opting to employ the large pool of formerly dispossessed freemen in sharecropping arrangements. With the end of Augustus' reign (27 BC - 14 AD), the major Roman wars of conquest ceased until the reign of Emperor Trajan (reigned 98–117 AD), and with them ended the supply of plentiful and inexpensive slaves through military conquest. This era of peace further promoted the use of freedmen as laborers in agricultural estates. The legal status and rights of Roman slaves also began to change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a constitution was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen.Suetonius, Life of Claudius, 25.2 Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown that they were being mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal.Gaius, Institvtionvm Commentarivs, I:52; Seneca, De Beneficiis, III:22. Gaius details the changes in the rights of owners to inflict whatever treatment they wished on their slaves, while Seneca details the slaves' right to proper treatment and the creation of a \\"slave ombudsman\\". While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades. It is difficult to determine the extent to which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.Though there were other slave revolts in the future. See, e.g., Zosimus, Historia Nova, I.71.  In popular culture  * The film Spartacus (1960), which was executive-produced by and starred Kirk Douglas, was based on Howard Fast's novel Spartacus and directed by Stanley Kubrick.

Founded on January 1, 1652, based on academic models in Italy, it was originally named the Academia Naturae Curiosorum until 1687 when Emperor Leopold I raised it to an academy and named it after himself. It was since known under the German name Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina until 2007, when it was declared to be Germany's National Academy of Sciences. The Leopoldina has a claim to be the oldest continuously existing learned society in the world. The validity of the claim depends in part on how certain definitional and historical questions are answered. Some societies covering only specific disciplines are older (e.g. the Royal College of Physicians was founded in 1519) and the Royal Society started informally in 1646 and received its charter in 1662 so is sometimes considered the oldest.Self-produced overview of the Leopoldina (accessed Apr. 29, 2016) History Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire Miscellanea Curiosa (1692) An illustration of the Acta Eruditorum of 1712 where the Naturae Curiosorum Ephemerides were published The Leopoldina was founded in the imperial city of Schweinfurt on 1 January 1652 under the Latin name sometimes translated into English as \\"Academy of the Curious as to Nature.\\"As for instance in the monumental A History of Magic and Experimental Science by Lynn Thorndike (see online). It was founded by four local physicians- Johann Laurentius Bausch, the first president of the society, Johann Michael Fehr, Georg Balthasar Metzger, and Georg Balthasar Wohlfarth; and was the only academy like it at the time making it the oldest academy of science in Germany. The archives of Leopoldina are some of the oldest in the world based on the fact that the records date back to the 17th century. These records will provide a window into the German sciences of the last 350 years. In 1670 the society began to publish the Ephemeriden or Miscellanea Curiosa, one of the earliest scientific journals and one which had a particularly strong focus on medicine and related aspects of natural philosophy, such as botany and physiology., pp. 7–8 It was recognized by Emperor Leopold I who raised it to an academy in 1677, and then declared it an Imperial Academy in 1687, naming it Sacri Romani Imperii Academia Caesareo- Leopoldina Naturae Curiosorum and allowing it to carry his name.Groschenheft magazine on the Leopoldina's anniversary (German) (accessed May 27, 2005) Main building of Leopoldina in Halle. At first, the society conducted its business by correspondence and was located wherever the president was working., pp. 8–9 After Schweinfurt, the Academy was rooted in many places before it was permanently located in Halle in 1878. Following Schweinfurt in chronological order: Nuremberg, Augsburg, Altdorf, Erfurt, Halle, Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bonn, Jena, Dresden, and finally Halle., pp. 8–9 There were many efforts during years of national prosperity to elevate the Academy to the status of a 'national institute,' but all such early efforts failed. In those times the Academy was not on the nation's agenda at a political or academic level. Later, however, its members began to enrich the Academy with an obligation to be present at its proceedings so as to improve their public standing. Thus they began to hold regular monthly meetings, even in the challenging conditions of 1924,, pp. 8–9 which had to be attended by all local members. When Adolf Hitler became Germany's Chancellor in 1933, the Leopoldina started to exclude its Jewish members. Albert Einstein was one of the first victims, and more than 70 followed until 1938. Eight of them were murdered by the Nazis over the course of World War II.Speech of Leopoldinas president Volker ter Meulen 2009 Nevertheless, the Leopoldina did not suffer as much influence from the Nazi regime as other German academies, thanks to the president of the Leopoldina at the time, Emil Abderhalden. While Jewish members were certainly expelled, the president of the Leopoldina made sure it did not go to the lengths that other academies went to at the time. He resisted the Nazi pressures by reorganizing Sections of the Academy and introducing a new series 'Biographies of German Natural Scientists' in 1932. After World War II, Halle became part of East Germany. During this time, the German Democratic Republic shut down all societies, leading the members of the Leopoldina to meet unofficially and in private. Efforts were made to reestablish the Academy, however. An edition of Goethe's 'The Works of Science' began to be edited under the Academy's name in 1947, and lectures started again in 1948. However, the Academy was not officially reopened until 1952. This reopening came just in time for the Academy to celebrate its tercentenary. After reopening, the Leopoldina successfully resisted attempts from the German Democratic Republic to reconstitute the Academy as a specifically East German institute and continued to think of itself as an institution for the whole of Germany. This was greatly affected by the building of the Berlin Wall in August of 1961. The Academy was able to stay independent of national politics, which allowed it to bridge East and West Germany through scientific ideas. The yearly meeting of the Academy was planned for October of that year in West Germany; invitations had been sent out in June announcing that they would be discussing energy; but less than two months later letters of cancellation were sent out, stating that members living in the GDR would not be given permission to travel. In 1991, after German reunification, the Leopoldina was granted the status of a non- profit organisation. It is funded jointly by the German government and the government of the state of Saxony-Anhalt., pp. 10–14 A new section was also created for the history of culture with the emphasis on medicine and the natural sciences. In November 2007, German science minister Annette Schavan announced the renaming of the Leopoldina to \\"German Academy of Sciences\\" (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften), and said that \\"due to its international prestige, the Leopoldina is predestined to represent Germany within the circle of international academies.\\" Karsten Jedlitschka says that the Academy was named the first national science Academy in Germany in February of 2008. As the German Academy of Sciences, it is a counterpart to the rights and responsibilities of institutions such as Britain's Royal Society and the United States' National Academy of Science. As the national academy, the Leopoldina will act as a consulting service on matters of science and science related policy for the German government, including parliament and social and political organizations.  Activities  The Leopoldina is the first and foremost academic society in Germany to advise the German government on a variety of scientific matters, for instance on climate change and disease control. The Leopoldina gives conferences and lectures and continues to publish the Ephemeriden under the name Nova Acta Leopoldina. It issues various medals and awards, offers grants and scholarships and elects new members to itself. The Academy also maintains a library and an archive and it also researches its own history and publishes another journal, Acta Historica Leopoldina devoted to this subject., pp. 15–33 Consistently with its national preeminence, it also collaborates extensively with other learned societies in international exchanges of ideas and policy recommendations. Details of such initiatives are included on its multilingual website.  Honours  Apart from being a fellow, excellence can also be rewarded by receiving one of the following honours: * honorary membership * Cothenius Medal (first awarded in 1792) * Carus Medal (first awarded in 1896) * Schleiden Medal (first awarded in 1955) *Mendel Medal (since 1965, in honour of Gregor Mendel) * Darwin Badge (only awarded in 1959 – the centenary of the publication of The origin of species) * Leopoldina Prize for Junior Scientists * Georg Uschmann Prize for History of Science * Leopoldina Research Prize (since 2001, funded by the Commerzbank Foundation) * Thieme Prize of the Leopoldina for Medicine * Medal of Merit (awarded by the Presidium only on special occasions)  Membership  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Three quarters of the members are from German- speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and one quarter from about 30 other nations. The election to membership of the Leopoldina is the highest academic honour awarded by an institution in Germany. Some laureates are also fellows of the Leopoldina. Among the most noted of fellows are for instance: * Christian Ludwig Brehm * Adolf Butenandt * James B. Conant * Manfred Eigen * Albert Einstein (excluded 1933 for being Jewish) * Gerhard Ertl * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe * Otto Hahn * Theodor W. Hänsch * Paula Hertwig * Joseph Lister * Alexander Oparin * Wilhelm Ostwald * Max Planck * Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker Members might also attribute discoveries and success to the academy. For example, the asteroid 893 Leopoldina is named in its honour.  Leadership  Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber At the head of the Academy there is a Presidium, elected by the Senate, consisting of the President, acting as the chair, four Vice Presidents, and other members at large. These position terms are five years long and can only be held twice by the same person. The Senate of the Academy currently consists of 39 members representing different sections and disciplines of science, as well as representatives from Switzerland and Austria. Senate members serve for four years and can only be re-elected once.

It believed the left had \\"lost its way\\" through \\"sectarianism\\", which it defined as the refusal to unite in a single workers' party unless each group's own programmatic demands are met.

It is known from a nearly complete skull found in the Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin. Fossil dealers had acquired this skull and illegally sold it to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. In 1996, the specimen became the holotype of the type species Irritator challengeri. The genus name comes from the word \\"irritation\\", reflecting the feelings of paleontologists who found the skull had been heavily damaged and altered by the collectors. The species name is an homage to the fictional character Professor Challenger from Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. Some paleontologists regard Angaturama limai—known from a snout tip that was described later in 1996—as a potential junior synonym of Irritator. Both animals hail from the same stratigraphic units of the Araripe Basin. It was also previously proposed that Irritator and Angaturamas skull parts belonged to the same specimen. Although this has been cast into doubt, more overlapping fossil material is needed to confirm whether they are the same animal or not. Other spinosaurid skeletal material, some of which could belong to Irritator or Angaturama, was retrieved from the Romualdo Formation, allowing for a replica skeleton to be made and mounted for display at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro in 2009. Estimated at between in length, Irritator weighed around , making it one of the smallest spinosaurids known. Its long, shallow and slender snout was lined with straight and unserrated conical teeth. Lengthwise atop the head ran a thin sagittal crest, to which powerful neck muscles were likely anchored. The nostrils were positioned far back from the tip of the snout, and a rigid secondary palate on the roof of the mouth would have strengthened the jaw when feeding. Belonging to a subadult, Irritator challengeris holotype remains the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull yet found. The Angaturama snout tip expanded to the sides in a rosette-like shape, bearing long teeth and an unusually tall crest. One possible skeleton indicates it, like other spinosaurids, had enlarged first-finger claws and a sail running down its back. Irritator had been mistaken initially for a pterosaur, and later a maniraptoran dinosaur. In 1996, the animal was identified as a spinosaurid theropod. The holotype skull was thoroughly prepared before being redescribed in 2002, confirming this classification. Both Irritator and Angaturama belong to the Spinosaurinae subfamily. A generalist diet—like that of today's crocodilians—has been suggested; Irritator might have preyed mainly on fish and any other small prey animals it could catch. Fossil evidence is known of an individual that ate a pterosaur, either from hunting or scavenging it. Irritator may have had semiaquatic habits, and inhabited the tropical environment of a coastal lagoon surrounded by dry regions. It coexisted with other carnivorous theropods as well as turtles, crocodyliforms, and a large number of pterosaur and fish species. History of research Northeast Region of Brazil, with the discovery sites of three spinosaurine fossil specimens in the Araripe and São Luís-Grajaú Basins marked. From top to bottom: Oxalaia, Irritator, and Angaturama. Commercial fossil-poachers excavated a chalk concretion containing the rear of a large skull with lower jaws near the town of Santana do Cariri in northeastern Brazil. This fossil was acquired by dealers who illegally sold it—fossil trade has been prohibited by law in Brazil since 1942—to Rupert Wild of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany. At the time it was assumed to be the skull of a giant basal pterosaur, or flying reptile, since the Chapada do Araripe region is famous for its copious pterosaur finds, and the German museum often bought such pieces. As it promised to be a unique discovery of singular importance, German and British pterosaur experts were contacted to study the exemplar. A paper describing it as a pterosaur had already been submitted for publication when the authors, German paleontologist Eberhard Frey and British paleontologist David Martill, were disabused of this notion by the peer reviewers, who suggested the fossil belonged to a theropod dinosaur. Outdated reconstruction of the holotype skull (top) based on the interpretations of Martill and colleagues in 1996. Depictions (similar to the one at the bottom) based on this reconstruction were later featured in many dinosaur books and encyclopedias. The skull was flattened somewhat sideways and, as is common with fossils, was partly crushed. The right side was well-preserved, while the left was extensively damaged during collection. Some of the skull's hindmost upper surface had eroded, and the lower jaw lacked its front end, both owing to breakage during fossilization. Parts of the specimen were also cracked due to being part of a septarian concretion. The tip of the upper jaw was also missing. Since there were no signs of erosion, it had most probably broken off during or after the fossil's collection. Evident corrosion on certain bones indicates acid preparation had been attempted. A vertical fracture was present across the middle of the skull, which had apparently been sealed with car body filler. In hopes of making it look more complete and valuable, the fossil traders had severely obscured the skull beneath plaster; a widespread practice among local collectors in the Chapada do Araripe, especially on fish fossils. The buyers were unaware of the modifications to the illegally collected specimen until it was sent to universities in the United Kingdom for CT scan imaging. This revealed the collectors had tried to reconstruct the skull by grafting parts of the maxilla (main upper jaw bone) onto the front of the rostrum (snout). The skull (designated SMNS 58022) became the holotype specimen of the new genus and species Irritator challengeri in February 1996, when it was first scientifically described by paleontologists David M. Martill, Arthur R.I. Cruickshank, Eberhard Frey, Philip G. Small and Malcolm Clarke. In this paper, Martill and his team wrote that the generic name Irritator came \\"from irritation, the feeling the authors felt (understated here) when discovering that the snout had been artificially elongated.\\" The type species, Irritator challengeri, was named after Professor Challenger, a character in Arthur Conan Doyle's novels, specifically The Lost World. Two years earlier, Frey and Martill had named a new pterosaur species from the Crato Formation Arthurdactylus conandoylei, after the novelist himself. When Martill and colleagues first described Irritator challengeri, the holotype was still extensively encased in calcareous rock matrix. Under the supervision of American paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues, technician Diane M. Scott from the University of Toronto at Mississauga assumed the task of fully extracting the skull bones from the rock, allowing for a detailed redescription in 2002. Published by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, this inspection of the now fully prepared specimen negated many of Martill and colleagues' original observations, which were based on misinterpretations of the damaged and largely concealed skull. The estimated length of the complete skull was shorter than previously proposed. What was originally thought to be a prominent head crest proved to be an unattached, indeterminate bone fragment. As in the previous study, Sues and colleagues regarded the African genus Spinosaurus as the most similar taxon to Irritator, because they shared many dental features, including mostly straight conical tooth crowns, thin enamel, well-defined edges with no , and lengthwise fluting. Since little was known of Spinosauruss skull at the time, these similarities were enough for the authors to suggest a possible junior synonymy of Irritator with Spinosaurus. Sues and colleagues noted that more overlapping skull material was needed for further diagnosis. As more of Spinosauruss skull became known, later research maintained separation of the two taxa. Although the site of discovery is uncertain, the specimen most probably stems from the Romualdo Formation (previously designated the Romualdo Member of the then Santana Formation). This assignment was confirmed by microfossils of the ostracod Pattersoncypris, and fish scales from the ichthyodectid Cladocyclus, both found in the Romualdo Formation. Questioning of local fossil dealers hinted at a locality near the village of Buxexé close to Santana Do Cariri at the flank of the Chapada do Araripe, at a height of approximately . Since the Romualdo Formation is indeed exposed there, and the matrix encasing the holotype has the same color and texture as those rocks, this locality can be regarded as the probable site of the discovery of the fossil. Irritator challengeri was the first dinosaur described from the Romualdo Formation, and its holotype specimen represents the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull known. =Synonymy with Angaturama= Known skull elements of Irritator as interpreted by paleontologist Jaime A. Headden; the snout tip is from the Angaturama specimen. Angaturama limai, another spinosaurid from the same time and place as Irritator challengeri, was described by the Brazilian paleontologists Alexander W. A. Kellner and Diogenes de Almeida Campos in February 1996. Kept today under specimen number USP GP/2T-5 at the University of São Paulo, the holotype specimen consists of an isolated snout tip from the Romualdo Formation. It was extracted from a calcareous nodule using a technique originally developed for pterosaur fossils. The generic name is in reference to Angaturama, a protective spirit in the aboriginal Tupi Indian culture of Brazil. The specific name honors the late Brazilian paleontologist Murilo R. de Lima, who informed Kellner of the specimen in 1991. maxillary tooth, as proposed by Sales and Schultz in 2017 In 1997, British paleontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner considered Angaturama a likely junior synonym of Irritator, noting that both genera had retracted nostrils, long jaws, and characteristic spinosaurid dentition. Paul Sereno and colleagues in 1998 agreed with this possibility, and additionally observed that the holotype of Angaturama seems to complete that of Irritator (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). Authors including Éric Buffetaut and Mohamed Ouaja in 2002, Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues in 2005, Tor G. Bertin in 2010, Darren Naish in 2013, and Madani Benyoucef and colleagues in 2015 supported this conclusion. In their redescription of Irritator, Sues and colleagues pointed out that both holotypes are equally as narrow, and share transversely round teeth with defined yet unserrated edges. They also noted that a sagittal crest on Angaturamas premaxillae may correspond with that of Irritators nasal bones. Some objection has been raised to these assertions. Kellner and Campos in 2000 and Brazilian paleontologist Elaine B. Machado and Kellner in 2005 expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the holotype of Angaturama limai was clearly more laterally flattened than that of Irritator challengeri. A review of both fossils by the Brazilian paleontologists Marcos A. F. Sales and Cesar L. Schultz in 2017 noted that the specimens also differ in other aspects of their preservation: the Irritator specimen is brighter in color and is affected by a vertical crack, while the Angaturama specimen bears many cavities; the damage to the teeth of the Irritator challengeri holotype is also much less severe. Sales and Schultz also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of Angaturama could have been larger than that of Irritator based on the proportions of the closely related genus Baryonyx. They therefore concluded that the two specimens do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If Angaturama and Irritator are regarded as a member of the same genus, the latter would be the valid scientific name under rules of priority, since it was named almost a month earlier. = Postcranial material and additional finds = Spinosaurine pelvis and sacral vertebrae (specimen MN 4819-V), National Museum of Rio de Janeiro Besides the skull, the snout fragment, and some isolated teeth, the Romualdo Formation has also yielded l remains that may belong to spinosaurids, many of which are hitherto undescribed, and all of them pertaining to the Spinosaurinae subfamily. In 2004, parts of a spinal column (MN 4743-V) were unearthed at the formation. Brazilian paleontologist Jonathas Bittencourt and Kellner assigned these, due to their structure, to the Spinosauridae. It is uncertain whether this specimen can be referred to Irritator or Angaturama, given that both are based only on skull material. In 2007, Machado and Kellner tentatively referred a rib fragment (MN 7021-V) to the Spinosauridae. However, the most complete spinosaur specimen retrieved from the Romualdo Formation is MN 4819-V, a partial skeleton lacking the skull. First reported in 1991, the specimen was referred by Kellner to the Spinosauridae in 2001 because of its tall sacral neural spines and the enlarged condition of the hand claw. The skeleton was fully described in 2010 in an as-of-yet unpublished master's thesis by Machado. An incomplete hind limb (MPSC R-2089) mentioned in 2013 might also pertain to the Spinosauridae. In 2018, Tito Aureliano and his team described LPP-PV-0042, part of a left tibia from a particularly large individual. As is common with fossils from the Araripe Basin, the majority of spinosaurid material from the Romualdo Formation was collected under uncontrolled circumstances for use in the illegal fossil trade. As such, many specimens are partly damaged and without precise geological field data. Some of the Romualdo Formation postcrania were used as the basis for the creation of a replica Angaturama skeleton, later mounted at the Federal University- owned Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (National Museum of Rio de Janeiro).O Estado de S. Paulo , 2009-05-14, available at ; O Globo, 2009-05-15, abridgement available at ; University's announcement at The skeleton depicted the animal carrying an anhanguerid pterosaur in its jaws. It was the centerpiece of the Dinossauros no Sertão (Dinosaurs of Sertão) exhibit, which opened to the public in March 2009, becoming the first large carnivorous Brazilian dinosaur to be put on display. Some of the original postcranial elements (including the fossil pelvis and sacral vertebrae) were presented alongside the mount. In press releases of the exhibit's opening, Kellner informally implied MN 4819-V as belonging to Angaturama. This is also reflected in the specimen's inclusion in the skeletal mount. In 2011, a third Brazilian spinosaur, Oxalaia quilombensis, was named and described from the Alcântara Formation of the Itapecuru Group, part of the São Luís Basin. This larger species, known only from an isolated snout tip and upper jaw fragment, lived during the Cenomanian stage, around six to nine million years after Irritator and Angaturama. Oxalaia quilombensis is differentiated from Angaturama limai by its broader, more rounded snout and lack of a sagittal crest on the premaxillae. In September 2018, a fire broke out at the palace housing the Museu Nacional, largely destroying the fossil collections and possibly the exhibited Angaturama skeleton and fossil elements. The holotype of Oxalaia quilombensis, which was stored in the same building, may also have been destroyed. Description Estimated size of Irritator (light green) and Angaturamas (dark green) holotype specimens with a human Even by maximal size estimates, Irritator was smaller than other known spinosaurids. Gregory S. Paul calculated its length at and weight at . Thomas R. Holtz Jr. published a higher estimate of , with a weight between . Estimates by Dougal Dixon were lower at long and high. When scaled by Aureliano and colleagues, the reconstructions from the study by Sales and Schultz provided a length of for the Irritator challengeri holotype, and for the Angaturama limai holotype. Some of the skull bones of the former holotype had not yet fully co-ossified (fused), indicating that the specimen belonged to a subadult. The partial spinosaurine skeleton MN 4819-V represented a moderately-sized individual, estimated by Machado at in length. Many elements from this specimen were incorporated into the skeletal mount in the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, which had a length of and a height of . However, spinosaurids from the Romualdo Formation possibly attained greater sizes. Although LPP-PV-0042 is represented only by a tibia fragment, Aureliano and colleagues estimated its length at roughly . Bone histology indicates that this individual was a subadult, so the mature animal may have been larger. =Anatomy of the Irritator challengeri holotype= Holotype skull of Irritator challengeri from left (top) and right side views The holotype skull of Irritator challengeri, although heavily damaged in certain places, is largely complete; missing only the tip of the snout and the front of the mandible. The preserved skull is tall and wide, its full length has been estimated at roughly , based on comparisons with Baryonyx. Irritators skull was long, narrow, and somewhat triangular in cross section. The was inclined backwards, and deeper than it was long. Extending from it was an elongate and low snout, with both sides relatively flat and slightly angled towards the skull midline. Only the rear ends of the paired (frontmost snout bones) remain intact, forming the front upper and lower borders of the (bony nostrils). As in all spinosaurids, the (main upper jaw bones) extended below and past the nostrils in a long, low branch that formed the lower border of this opening, consequently separating the premaxillae and bones in that location. Irritators maxillary sinuses (located in the body of the maxillae) bore a large oval opening, as in Allosaurus. The nostril openings were oval and, as in all spinosaurids, positioned farther back on the skull than in typical theropods. Irritators nostrils were both proportionately and absolutely smaller than in Suchomimus and Baryonyx, but larger than those of Spinosaurus. The opening behind the orbit (eye socket), the lateral temporal fenestra, was very large, while the antorbital fenestra, in front of the eyes, was long and elliptical. The orbit itself was deep and wider at the top (where the eyeball was placed) than the bottom. The bone separated the orbit from the antorbital fenestra, forming the upper and lower rear margins of the latter with two processes that enclosed a 40-degree angle; similar to Baryonyx, where it enclosed 35 degrees. Unlike in Baryonyx, Irritators lacrimal did not form a bony horn core. The prefrontal bones were large and sturdy, while the thinner bones, situated behind them, were smooth and concave on top; both of these bones formed the upper rim of the orbit. restoration combining specimens of Irritator and Angaturama A thin sagittal crest, constructed from the elongate nasal bones, extended along the skull midline before stopping just above the eye in a slightly flattened bulge. Although the complete shape and height of this structure is unknown in Irritator, these head crests were commonplace in spinosaurids, having possibly served a display function when the animal was alive. The preserved part of Irritators crest is deepest above the antorbital fenestra and lacks the vertical ridges seen in the crest of Spinosaurus. Like others in its family, Irritator possessed a long and bony structure on the roof of its mouth called a secondary palate, separating the oral from the nasal cavity. This is a feature observed in extant crocodilians, but absent in most theropod dinosaurs. Also like its relatives, Irritator had two additional openings on the skull roof (called the postnasal fenestrae) as well as long and only partially diverging (bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate). The back of the lower jaw was deep, its rear upper surface consisting mainly of the large bone, which with the shallower bone below it. The , a sideways-facing opening in the lower jaw, was oval and comparatively large. The (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) is unknown in Irritator, save for a possible remnant at the front of the surangular. Irritator challengeris holotype is unique in that it is one of the few non-avian (or non-bird) dinosaur fossils found with a preserved stapes. Closeup of Irritators upper jaw and Irritator had straight or only faintly recurved conical teeth, bearing sharply defined but unserrated edges. Flutes (lengthwise ridges) were present on its tooth crowns, a common dental trait among spinosaurids. Both sides of Irritators teeth were fluted, as in Spinosaurus, whereas Baryonyx exhibited them only on the lingual (inward facing) side of its teeth. Irritators teeth were circular in cross section, as opposed to the laterally flattened condition of most theropod teeth. The enamel (first layer of the teeth) was thin, with a finely wrinkled texture also observed in Baryonyx. Both of Irritators maxillae preserve nine teeth, although the left maxilla's tooth crowns are more intact, and there are traces of a tenth tooth in the rock matrix. The teeth were deeply inserted into the jaw and widely spaced towards the front of the maxilla. The first and second preserved maxillary teeth were the largest, at and in crown length. The seven remaining teeth became progressively smaller towards the rear, one of the last ones measuring in estimated crown length. CT scans performed on the specimen revealed replacement teeth on both sides of the upper jaw. Their roots ran deep into the maxillae and converged close to the midline, nearly reaching the top of the skull. Based on comparisons with Irritators relatives, the maxillae were probably lined with a total of 11 teeth each, similar to the number of 12 teeth in MSNM V4047, an upper jaw fossil referred to Spinosaurus. The hindmost tooth of the Irritator specimen's left maxilla was not yet fully erupted, and only the tip of it was visible. =Anatomy of the Angaturama limai holotype= Holotype of Angaturama limai from various angles The holotype of Angaturama limai consists only of the front part of the upper jaw, comprising the tips of the paired premaxillae and the frontmost ends of the maxillae. The specimen measures in height and in length, with the width of the palatal region being . The suture between the maxilla and premaxilla was jagged at the front and straightened out towards the rear. The lower margin of the premaxillae was concave, with the concavity reaching its apex at the sixth premaxillary tooth. The front of the snout was expanded, forming the spoon-shaped terminal rosette characteristic of spinosaurids. This concave underside of the premaxillae would have complemented a convex and enlarged mandible tip. The premaxillae connected with each other on the bottom to form Angaturamas secondary palate, which was also partially contributed to by two processes extending from the maxillae. The snout was strongly compressed laterally, and the premaxillae gently tapered towards the top to form a tall sagittal crest in thickness. This crest was larger and extended farther forwards on the snout than in other known spinosaurids. The frontmost upper border of the premaxilla had a small bulge that overhung the base of the crest. This bulge was apparently damaged on its upper surface, indicating that the top of the crest may have extended even farther over and forwards from that point. The front of Angaturamas snout hence had a vertically straight or concave margin, atypical from the more smoothly-sloping snouts of other spinosaurs. In the premaxilla, a broken-off tooth with partial tooth crown was recovered. The strongly extended and straight teeth with unserrated conical crowns, which measured in length, were singly embedded. This indicates continuous tooth replacement where new teeth were pushed up between the old ones. Judging by the (tooth sockets), the premaxilla had seven teeth altogether, the third tooth being the largest. The frontmost three teeth of the maxilla were also preserved. The premaxillary teeth increased in size from the first to third, shrank from the third to the sixth, and enlarged again from the sixth premaxillary to third maxillary positions. A diastema (gap in tooth row) was present between the last premaxillary and first maxillary tooth. =Postcrania= Hand and arm bones of specimen MN 4819-V, the most complete spinosaurid hand known Though no skeletal remains were discovered with the original Angaturama snout tip, one partial skeleton (MN 4819-V) from a different location may belong to the genus. But since there is no overlapping material between the two specimens, direct comparisons cannot be made. MN 4819-V comprises a largely intact pelvis, some dorsal (back) and (tail) vertebrae, five (hip) vertebrae, a partial right and (shin and calf bones), most of the right (thigh bone), and part of an (forearm bone). It also has the most complete hand known from a spinosaurid, including , , one , and one . Like in all spinosaurids, the claw of the first finger (the \\"thumb\\") was enlarged. The pelvic bones are well- preserved, with the right side better articulated than the left. The fused sacral vertebrae are still attached to the pelvis, which lacks the distal ends of both of its and (lower and rearmost hip bones). The (main hip bone) is long. The (front expansion) of the ilium was curved on the bottom and was somewhat shorter and deeper than the (rear expansion). The preacetabular ala were somewhat enlarged at the front, in contrast to the more slender condition of the postacetabular ala. The (groove at the bottom of the postacetabular ala) was concave, as was the rear margin of the ischium. The pubis bore a relatively large and almost closed , an indentation in the lower margin of the rear part of the bone that allowed for the passage of the obturator nerve. The upwards projecting neural spines of the sacrum were elongated, as is typical in spinosaurs. In life, these would have been covered in skin, forming a \\"sail\\" down the animal's back. MN 4819-V is distinguished from Suchomimus due to its longer and shallower ilium with a less curved upper margin, and from Baryonyx by having a more developed , a blade-like structure on the bottom of the ischium. Classification Size of various spinosaurids (Irritator in purple, first from left) compared with a human Martill and his team originally classified Irritator as a maniraptoran dinosaur in the clade Bullatosauria (a group no longer considered monophyletic), as a close relative to the feathered ornithomimosaurs and troodontids. Given that its dental morphology, particularly long snout, and assumed fin-shaped crest were features unknown in \\"other\\" maniraptorans, the researchers erected the new family Irritatoridae within the clade. They recognized Irritators affinities with Spinosaurus, in that they both had similarly shaped and unserrated teeth, but noted that the latter's mandible would not conform with the front of Irritators upper jaw, and that other non-avian dinosaurs like Compsognathus and Ornitholestes also bore no serrations on some or all of their teeth. Some of these claims were questioned in 1996 by Kellner who found that Irritators skull lacked the one autapomorphy (distinguishing feature) diagnosed in maniraptorans at the time, which was having its (cheek) bone forming part of the antorbital fenestra. He also pointed out that since Irritator challengeris holotype lacked the tip of its snout, it would not be possible to know if Spinosauruss dentary could complement it or not. Based on comparisons with Spinosaurus, Kellner resolved Irritator as a spinosaurid and synonymized Irritatoridae with that family. Irritator was then assigned to the Baryonychidae along with Angaturama, Baryonyx, Suchomimus, and Spinosaurus by Oliver W.M. Rauhut in 2003. Thomas Holtz and colleagues in 2004 considered the Baryonychidae synonymous with Spinosauridae, and moved these genera to the latter family. Most later revisions have upheld these classifications. As spinosaurids, Irritator and Angaturama are placed within the superfamily Megalosauroidea, with Spinosauridae being a possible sister taxon to the Megalosauridae. Diagram illustrating skull elements from Irritator (bottom) and other spinosaurids, comparing the relative positions of the , or bony nostrils, (labeled e.n.) In 1998, Sereno and colleagues defined two subfamilies within the Spinosauridae based on craniodental (skull and tooth) characteristics. They were Spinosaurinae, where they placed Spinosaurus and Irritator; and Baryonychinae, to which they assigned Baryonyx, Suchomimus, and Cristatusaurus. Spinosaurines were distinguished by their unserrated, straighter, and more widely spaced teeth, as well as smaller first teeth of the premaxilla. In 2005, Dal Sasso and colleagues assumed Irritators nostrils as being located above the middle of the maxillary tooth row; more posteriorly than in baryonychines, but less so than in Spinosaurus. Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that Irritators nostrils were in fact positioned closer to the front of the jaw, as in Baryonyx and Suchomimus; this more forward nostril placement was typically considered characteristic of baryonychines. Nevertheless, Irritator also bore unserrated teeth, a trait associated with spinosaurines. Sales and Schultz thus noted that the Araripe Basin spinosaurids Irritator and Angaturama might represent intermediate forms between the earlier baryonychines and later spinosaurines, and that further research may eventually render the former a paraphyletic (unnatural) group. Irritator is further distinguished from Baryonyx, Suchomimus, and Cristatusaurus by having slightly over half as many teeth in the maxilla, and from Spinosaurus due to its comparatively larger and more forwardly positioned nostril openings, which, unlike in Spinosaurus, are also formed by the premaxilla. The narrow sagittal crest, which ends in a knob-like process above the frontals, is another autapomorphy separating Irritator from other spinosaurids. Although Angaturama limais snout is generally narrower than in other spinosaurids, this might be due to damage sustained by the fossil; the holotype appears partly crushed and broken on its lower margin, with some of the preserved teeth having been sectioned off along their length. Therefore, Angaturamas only valid autapomorphy is its sagittal crest, which extends farther forwards on the rostrum and is more exaggerated than in other known spinosaurid skulls. Topology A: Benson and colleagues (2009) Topology B: Sales and Schultz (2017) Paleobiology =Diet and feeding= Head of an Indian gharial, which has similarities to the head of Irritator In 1996, Martill and colleagues theorized that Irritator challengeri, with its elongated snout and unserrated conical teeth, likely had at least a partly piscivorous (fish-eating) diet. Although much of the holotype's morphology turned out to be greatly different than they thought, later studies supported these observations. Spinosaurids had very narrow and elongated jaws with relatively homogeneous pointed teeth, an arrangement found particularly in animals like the Indian gharial—the most piscivorous extant crocodilian. The long conical teeth, which in spinosaurines did not possess serrated edges, were suitable for grabbing and holding prey. They differed from teeth of other theropods, which seemed geared towards tearing or cutting off seized body parts. Closeup of reconstructed skull and neck Irritator shared with crocodilians a stiff secondary palate and reduced antorbital fenestrae. In 2007, a finite-element analysis study by British paleontologist Emily J. Rayfield and colleagues found that these attributes, present in other spinosaurids as well, made the skull more resistant to torsion from prey item loads when feeding. The authors pointed out that in contrast, most theropods lacked secondary palates and had large antorbital fenestrae, exchanging strength for lighter skull builds. The nostrils of Irritator were shifted far back from the snout tip; this, along with the secondary palate, which separated the animal's nasal passages from the inside of its mouth, made respiration possible even if most of the jaw was underwater or held prey. In particular, the sagittal crest of Irritator is an indication for pronounced neck musculature, which would have been necessary to close the jaws quickly against water resistance and withdraw the head rapidly. In 2015, German paleontologist Serjoscha W. Evers and colleagues found evidence for similar adaptations in the African spinosaur Sigilmassasaurus. The neck vertebrae of this genus have a heavily furrowed undersurface. This is consistent with the attachment of powerful neck muscles for use in fishing or rapidly snatching small prey, a trait also observed in extant crocodilians and birds. Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that Irritator and baryonychines might have relied more on their sense of smell for hunting than Spinosaurus did, since they had larger, less retracted nostrils and more room in their skulls for the nasal cavity. Spinosaurus itself probably made heavier use of senses like vision or the mechanoreceptors on the tip of its snout, like those used by crocodilians to sense prey moving in the water. Skeleton mounted as attacking an anhanguerid pterosaur, National Museum of Rio de Janeiro Another trait spinosaurs shared with gharials was an enlarged snout tip that wielded a rosette-shaped array of interlocking teeth, adept for impaling and catching fish. Although to a lesser degree than most known spinosaurs, this feature was also present in the Angaturama limai holotype. In 2002, Sues and colleagues pointed out, however, that there would be no reason to assume that the Spinosauridae specialized completely in fishing. They stressed rather that this head morphology indicates a generalistic feeding, particularly on small prey animals. In fact, portions of a young Iguanodon, a terrestrial herbivore, were found inside the fossil skeleton of one Baryonyx. Naish and colleagues in 2004 supported the theory that Irritator hunted both aquatic and terrestrial animals as a generalist within the coastal area and in addition probably searched for carrion. A tooth belonging to Irritator was discovered still inserted into the fossil neck vertebral column of an ornithocheirid pterosaur, likely with a wingspan of . This indicates that Irritator ate pterosaurs as well, although it is not known if it actively hunted these animals or simply scavenged the remains. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues presented a possible scenario for the food web of the Romualdo Formation. The researchers proposed that spinosaurines from the formation may have also preyed on terrestrial and aquatic crocodyliforms, juveniles of their own species, turtles, and small to medium-sized dinosaurs. This would have made spinosaurines apex predators within this particular ecosystem. =Aquatic habits= Many spinosaurs likely had semiaquatic habits, as has been shown in studies using techniques like isotope analysis and bone histology. It has been found that they probably took advantage of aquatic prey and environments (usually marginal and coastal habitats) to occupy a distinct ecological niche, therefore avoiding competition with more terrestrial theropods. Spinosaurines appear to have been more adapted for such lifestyles than baryonychines. A 2018 study by British paleontologist Thomas M. S. Arden and colleagues examined the morphology of spinosaurine skull bones for possible aquatic traits. They found that the frontal bones of Irritator, Spinosaurus, and Sigilmassasaurus were similar in being arched, concave on top, and narrowed at the front; features that would have resulted in the eyes being positioned further up on the head than in other theropods. In particular, the broad lower jaw and narrowed frontals of Irritator resulted in the orbits facing at a steep incline towards the midline of the skull, whereas most theropods had laterally facing orbits. These traits would have permitted the animal to see above the waterline when submerged. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues conducted an analysis on the Romualdo Formation tibia fragment. CT scanning of the specimen in the University of San Carlos revealed the presence of osteosclerosis (high bone density). This condition had previously only been observed in Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, as a possible way of facilitating submersion in water by making its bones heavier. The presence of this condition on the Brazilian leg fragment showed that compact bones had already evolved in spinosaurines at least 10 million years before the appearance of Spinosaurus in Morocco. According to phylogenetic bracketing—a method used to infer unknown traits in organisms by comparison with their relativesWitmer, L.M. 1995.The Extant Phylogenetic Bracket and the Importance of Reconstructing Soft Tissues in Fossils. in Thomason, J.J. (ed). Functional Morphology in Vertebrate Paleontology. New York. Cambridge University Press. pp. 19–33.—osteosclerosis therefore might have been the norm in the Spinosaurinae. The significance of these traits was questioned in a later 2018 publication, where Canadian paleobiologist Donald Henderson argued that osteosclerosis would not have changed a theropod's buoyancy to a significant extent. =Neuroanatomy and senses= CT scan of the holotype showing endocast and endosseous labyrinth In 2020, German paleontologist Marco Schade and colleagues analyzed the anatomy of the holotype skull braincase through CT scans, revealing numerous details about behavioral capabilities of Irritator. With the scans, they created a 3D model of the skull and braincase, discovering that Irritator had elongated olfactory tracts and a relatively large floccular recesses (area that pierces through the semicircular canals and connects the brain with the inner ear). The flocculus itself, is an important element in the coordination and control of head and ocular movements during gaze stabilization (visual ability during head movement), by being involved in the coordination of the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and vestibulo- collic (VCR) reflexes. The flocculus appears to be enlarged in taxa that rely on quick movements of the head body. In addition, the vestibular part of the endosseous labyrinth has a large anterior semicircular canal with a lateral oriented semicircular canal. Both floccular recesses and semicircular canal suggest that Irritator could coordinate fast head movements and had a downward inclined snout posture, enabling an unobstructed, stereoscopic forward vision, which is important for distance perception and therefore precise snatching movements of the snout. These inferences seem to be an agreement with a piscivore life-style. They also noted that the relatively well-developed cochlear duct may have enable an average hearing frequency of 1950 Hz with a frequency band width of 3196 Hz. However, they considered these ranges as rough estimates and established an overall frequency range of 350–3550 Hz, making Irritator to be placed under bird hearing but above crocodiles. Paleoenvironment and paleobiogeography Restoration of the head Irritator and Angaturama are known from the Romualdo Formation, whose rocks are dated to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, about 110 million years ago. During this time, the Southern Atlantic Ocean was opening, forming the series of circum-Atlantic basins of southern Brazil and southwestern Africa, but the northeastern part of Brazil and West Africa were still connected. The Romualdo Formation is part of the Santana Group and, at the time Irritator was described, was thought to be a member of what was then considered the Santana Formation. The Romualdo Formation is a Lagerstätte (a sedimentary deposit that preserves fossils in excellent condition) consisting of limestone concretions embedded in shales, and overlies the Crato Formation. It is well known for preserving fossils three-dimensionally in limestone concretions, including many pterosaur fossils. In addition to muscle fibres of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, fish preserving gills, digestive tracts, and hearts have been found there. The formation is interpreted as a coastal lagoon with irregular freshwater influence that contended with cycles of transgressing and regressing sea levels. The climate of the formation was tropical and largely corresponded to today's Brazilian climate. The regions surrounding the formation were arid to semi-arid, with most of the local flora being xerophytic (adapted to dry environments). Cycadales and the extinct conifer Brachyphyllum were the most widespread plants. Restoration of Irritator walking down a coastline in the Romualdo Formation environment This environment was dominated by pterosaurs, including: Anhanguera, Araripedactylus, Araripesaurus, Brasileodactylus, Cearadactylus, Coloborhynchus, Santanadactylus, Tapejara, Thalassodromeus, Tupuxuara, Barbosania, Maaradactylus, Tropeognathus, and Unwindia. The known dinosaur fauna besides Irritator was represented by other theropods like the tyrannosauroid Santanaraptor, the compsognathid Mirischia, an indeterminate unenlagiine dromaeosaurid, and a megaraptoran. The crocodyliforms Araripesuchus and Caririsuchus, as well as the turtles Brasilemys, Cearachelys, Araripemys, Euraxemys, and Santanachelys, are known from the deposits. There were also clam shrimps, sea urchins, ostracods, and molluscs. Various well-preserved fish fossils record the presence of: hybodont sharks, guitarfish, gars, amiids, ophiopsids, oshuniids, pycnodontids, aspidorhynchids, cladocyclids, bonefishes, chanids, mawsoniids and some uncertain forms. According to Naish and colleagues, the lack of herbivorous dinosaurs could mean that the local vegetation was scant and thus incapable of sustaining a large population of them. The abundant carnivorous theropods would have then likely turned to the lush aquatic life as a primary food source. They also hypothesized that following storm events, pterosaur and fish carcasses might have washed up on the shoreline, providing theropods with plenty of carrion. Multiple piscivorous animals were present in the formation, which might in theory have led to high competition. Aureliano and colleagues stated there must have, therefore, been some degree of niche partitioning, where different animals would have fed on prey of varied sizes and locations within the lagoon. Generalized locations of spinosaurid fossil discoveries from the Albian-Cenomanian, 113 to 93.9 million years ago, marked on a map of that time span Similarities between the fauna of the Romualdo and Crato Formations to that of Middle Cretaceous Africa suggest that the Araripe Basin was connected to the Tethys Sea, though this link was likely sporadic, because the lack of marine invertebrates indicates the basin had a non-marine depositional setting. Spinosaurids had already achieved a cosmopolitan distribution during the Early Cretaceous. Sereno and colleagues in 1998 suggested that with the opening of the Tethys Sea, spinosaurines would have evolved in the south (Africa, in Gondwana) and baryonychines in the north (Europe, in Laurasia). In following, Machado and Kellner theorized in 2005 that spinosaurines would have then spread to South America from Africa. Sereno and colleagues postulated that divergent evolution between spinosaurines in South America and Africa likely occurred as a consequence of the Atlantic Ocean, whose opening gradually separated the continents and contributed to differences between taxa. A similar scenario was suggested in 2014 by Brazilian paleontologist Manuel A. Medeiros and colleagues for the fauna of the Alcântara Formation, where Oxalaia has been found. But the paleobiogeography of spinosaurids remains highly theoretical and uncertain, with discoveries in Asia and Australia indicating that it may have been complex. = Taphonomy = The taphonomy (changes between death and fossilization) of the Irritator challengeri holotype specimen has been discussed by some researchers. The skull was found lying on its side. Preceding fossilization, several bones from the back of the braincase, as well as the dentary, splenial, coronoid, and right angular bones from the lower jaw, were lost. Other bones, mostly from the skull rear, had become and displaced towards alternate regions of the head before burial. Naish and colleagues in 2004 asserted that the Romualdo Formation dinosaur fauna is represented by animals that died near shorelines or rivers before being carried out to sea, where their floating remains were eventually fossilized. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues argued against this scenario, stating that the Irritator challengeri holotype's mandible was preserved in articulation with the rest of the skull, whereas it would have likely detached had the carcass been floating at sea. They also noted that the corpse would have quickly sunk due to the osteosclerosis of the skeleton. The researchers, therefore, concluded that fossils from the Santana Group represent organisms that were buried in their natural habitat, instead of having been deposited allochthonously (other than at their present position).

The board is based at Leighton House, Westbury in Wiltshire, England in a dedicated camp. It is commanded by the President AOSB, a Colonel in the British Army, supported by a number of vice-presidents. The current President is Col. Lucy Giles. AOSB is an equivalent of the Admiralty Interview Board and the Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre of the Royal Air Force.  History  The AOSB has its roots in the War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs) of World War II. The WOSBs were created by Army psychiatrists and established in 1942. They involved candidates taking a three-day stay in a country house, where tests were administered including written tests of mental ability, questionnaires, Leaderless Group tests and interviews. Psychiatrists and some psychological components of the WOSBs were removed from the Boards after the war. The Army Officer Selection Board was known as the Regular Commissions Board (RCB). In 1949, the RCB moved from Sussex to its current facilities at Leighton House in Westbury, Wiltshire. Both Regular and Army Reserve officers are screened here. Application process Applicants for the British Army undergo initial suitability assessments, through computer-based tests and interviews, along a number of routes. All officer candidates will be required to attend AOSB at a point determined by the type of entry. Candidates for scholarship, Welbeck Defence Sixth Form College and professionally qualified officers will attend only one board; other entrants will be required to attend both a briefing board and a main board. Candidates will usually have undertaken insight or familiarisation visits to appropriate units prior to attendance at the board. Board structure Candidates are divided into groups of 6 to 8, each supervised by a group leader who is a major or captain and who runs the activities and records evidence. A board consists of one or two groups and is presided over by a president or vice-president, with Professionally Qualified Officer boards supervised by an officer of the appropriate specialisation. Each group is assessed by a deputy president, who is a lieutenant colonel; their group leader; and an education advisor, who is a serving or retired officer of the AGC(ETS). Up to three boards can be run concurrently. Types of board =AOSB briefing= This takes place over two days and must be attended prior to being able to proceed to the main board. It is an opportunity for candidates to learn some of the techniques that will be tested at the main board and for the AOSB assessors to offer advice and guidance to those attending about how prepared they currently are to attempt the much more challenging main board. It is designed to give potential officers an idea of what is required and expected at the main board. Candidates will participate in a number of assessments including physical and intellectual ones during their time at briefing. The results will be used by AOSB assessors when feeding back to candidates. Before leaving AOSB briefing, candidates will be assigned a category based on the evidence available to the assessors. This will be: # Allowed to proceed to the main board as soon as desired. # Required to delay for between three and twenty four months (often awarded to younger candidates with potential ability but insufficient maturity, or for remedial purposes such as to improve upon physical fitness) # The candidate is thought unlikely to pass the Main Board based on the evidence presented at briefing. However, they are not prevented from attempting the Main Board if, after further consideration, they believe they can achieve the required standard. # The candidate is not considered suitable for commissioned service based on the evidence available. This may be as a result of a number of issues including personality or their ability to apply their intellect or both. Candidates who receive a Category 4 at the Briefing may appeal against this result if they genuinely believe that their performance at briefing was not representative. If successful (strong cases must be made) the candidate may be allowed to attend a Main Board. =AOSB main board= Cadets undertaking an obstacle course in preparation for an AOSB This is a four-day selection event that consists of a number of different but inter-linked intellectual, physical, mental and aptitude tests. It is designed to put candidates for both the Regular Army and Army Reserve under pressure whilst fostering their team spirit and competitiveness. The Boards normally run from Tuesday until Friday but a small number each year take place from Thursday until Sunday. On arrival, candidates are allocated a number (used instead of one's name) and placed into teams known as groups. They remain in these groups for the duration of the board, making it common for strong friendships to develop during the process. As candidates are assessed against a standard and not against each other's performance (there are no set quotas for acceptance – if you meet the standard you pass), it is not uncommon that strong groups will see a large proportion of their members meet the standard. On the last night of the course a formal dinner is held for the candidates. The staff are at pains to point out that the meal is not an assessment, and no directing staff are present at the event. The details of the physical tasks, command tasks, interviews and academic tests are not made public. It is known that the assessment consists of a physical fitness assessment, an individual obstacle course, three multiple-choice tests on current affairs, general knowledge and military knowledge, three interviews, a group discussion and essay on current and moral affairs, a 5-minute lecturette, individual planning exercise, and both leaderless team tasks and a series of command tasks where an individual team member commands the rest. There are also group races where each group gets an opportunity to test themselves against the other groups undergoing selection at the time. Candidates are only permitted to make 2 attempts to pass the board. These must be separated by a minimum of 8 months. AOSB selectors are looking for evidence throughout the main board that the candidate has the appropriate characteristics that after training will allow them to perform effectively as a Junior Officer in command of soldiers both in barracks and on operations. =CFCB (Cadet Forces) Board= The Cadet Forces Commissions Board is used to select officers for the Army Cadet Force. Run over a weekend, the course is broadly similar to the AOSB Main Board however there are no physical tests. There is no set quota for selection and candidates are assessed against a standard, not each other. Following completion of CFCB, a candidate is awarded one of four possible results: # Selected - The candidate has been successful at the board and is recommended for an army cadet force commission. # Not Selected (Encourage) - The candidate has not been successful, however it has been recognised that they have potential and are encouraged to attempt the board again at a later date. # Not Selected - The candidate has not been successful. If they wish, they can attempt the board again at a later date. # Not Selected (Discourage) - The candidate has not been successful and is deemed to be unsuitable for a commission. The candidate cannot normally attend for another attempt, however in extenuating circumstances their county commandant can appeal to the President CFCB for an exception to be made. If a candidate has not been successful at the board, they must wait at least 1 year before a second attempt. If the second attempt is unsuccessful, they must wait a minimum of 5 years for a third attempt. =Army Scholarship Board= The Army runs two Scholarship Boards each year for boys and girls aged between sixteen and seventeen. The board is similar in many ways to the Main Board, with a fitness test, interviews, planning exercise and leadership tasks. The board is only 24 hours, and is specifically tailored to suit candidates in this specific age range. The Board is designed to identify intelligence and leadership at a young age. Successful candidates are then subject to further scrutiny by Recruiting Group prior to potentially being awarded a financial award whilst at sixth form, and then a subsequent annual award for each year whilst studying at university. They are also awarded a final lump sum on completion of the 44-week Commissioning Course after university. By passing the Board, scholars have a guaranteed place at Sandhurst, and they do not need to pass the AOSB Main Board to enter RMAS. Physical fitness requirements Following the roll-out of new standardised fitness tests across the entire army in April 2019, the general fitness requirements for both regular and reserve officer entrants consists of the Role Fitness Test (Entry): * Reach 8.7 on a bleep test * Throw a 4kg medicine ball 3.1 metres from a seated position * Lift 76kg in a mid-thigh pull Standards are the same for male and female candidates.  Former Presidents  * Vivian Majendie 1943 – 1946 * Hubert Essame 1946 – 1949 * Francis Matthews 1949 – 1950 * Francis Festing October 1950 – March 1951 * George Erroll Prior-Palmer 1956 – 1957 * William Turner 1959 – 1961 * Reginald Hobbs 1960s * Jack d'Avigdor-Goldsmid February – September 1965 * David Lloyd Owen 1969 – 1972 Leighton House The estate on which Leighton House stands belonged to the Phipps family, a prominent family in Westbury's cloth industry. In 1800 Thomas Henry Hele Phipps, father of coffee merchants and politicians John Lewis and Charles Paul Phipps, built a Neoclassical box house, naming it Leighton House. William Laverton, who ran a wool mill inherited from his uncle Abraham Laverton, bought out the entire estate in 1888. He extended the house and planted trees, including a row of Araucaria araucana (Chilean pine) which still stands there today. Laverton ran his own in-house cricket team which played at W. H. Laverton's Ground and a home cinema until money ran out in 1921. The house briefly became a prep school before the War Office bought the estate in 1939. It previously housed a selection board for National Service. Since 1949 the Regular Commissions Board, later Army Officer Selection Board, has been based there. The estate comprises a 19th-century manor house (Leighton House itself), a trout lake and an assault course where potential officers are put through their paces. In 1978 Leighton House was designated as Grade II listed for its architectural significance, as it features designs from two different periods.  Future  In March 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Westbury site was one of ten to be sold in order to reduce the size of the Defence estate. In November 2016 the estimated date of disposal of the site was given as 2024, with the Selection Board due to move to Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Berkshire.

Like other dewberries, it is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, related to the blackberry. It is widely distributed across much of Europe and Asia from Ireland and Portugal as far east as Xinjiang Province in western China. It has also become sparingly naturalized in scattered locations in Argentina, Canada, and the United States.Flora of China, Rubus caesius Linnaeus, 1753. 欧洲木莓 ou zhou mu mei Flora of North America, Rubus caesius Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 1: 493. 1753. European dewberry Altervista Flora Italiana, Rubus caesius L. includes photos and European distribution map Description Pollination by red-tailed bumblebee Fruit Rubus caesius is similar to and often confused with forms of Rubus fruticosus. It is a small shrub growing up to tall with biennial stems which die after fruiting in their second year. It sends out long runners which root at the tip to form new plants. The stems are bluish-grey and sometimes prickly. The alternate leaves are hairy above and below. They are stalked and the leaf blades are palmate in shape, either consisting of three oval leaflets with serrated margins and acute points or just being three-lobed. The inflorescence is a loose cluster of several white flowers about in diameter. The calyx has five sepals and the corolla is composed of five spreading petals with finely toothed margins. There is a boss of stamens in the centre and there are several pistils. The fruit is an aggregate of several black, fleshy drupes with a bluish waxy bloom. The dewberry flowers from June to September. Distribution and habitat Rubus caesius most often inhabits areas with rocky, basic soil and light shade. It is often found in forest margins, coppices, rocky broadleaf woods and waterside thickets. The Dewberry can hybridise with the raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and the stone bramble (Rubus saxatilis). Hybrids Various hybrids and cultivars have been developed from the wild form of R. caesius, including 'Youngberry' (a raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries hybrid), olallie blackberry and marionberry.

The fourteener is located in the Holy Cross Wilderness of White River National Forest, west- southwest (bearing 244°) of the Town of Red Cliff in Eagle County, Colorado, United States. The summit of Mount of the Holy Cross is the highest point in Eagle County and the northern Sawatch Range. Mountain Mount of the Holy Cross was named for the distinctive cross-shaped snowfield on its northeast face. Under USDA Forest Service administration, the mountain was proclaimed \\"Holy Cross National Monument\\" by Herbert Hoover on May 11, 1929. The monument was transferred to the National Park Service in 1933. In 1950, it was returned to the Forest Service and lost its National Monument status—the number of visitors to the mountain and the nearby \\"Pilgrim's Hut\\" had waned, and the expense of full-time staff could not be justified. This mountain has been the subject of painters, photographers and even a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, (\\"The Cross of Snow\\"). The first publicly available photograph was published in National Geographic magazine. Thomas Moran depicted the mountain in an oil painting, which now is part of the collection of the Museum of the American West, part of the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, California. It is still much photographed but it is not as well known today as it was in the past.Kevin Blake, 2008, Imagining Heaven and Earth at Mount of the Holy Cross, Colorado, Journal of Cultural Geography 25(1): 1-26. Nearby features include Bowl of Tears Lake, directly under the east face of the peak, Tuhare Lakes, in a cirque that lies south of a significant subpeak, and several other lakes. Notable locations within include the Dotsero volcano (near Interstate 70), Vail and Aspen. US 24 runs near the peak through Gilman. Photochrom print of Mount of the Holy Cross c. 1900. This image is a reversed view of the mountain compared to how it actually appears. The first recorded ascent of Holy Cross was in 1873, by F. V. Hayden and photographer W. H. Jackson during one of Hayden's geographical surveys. However, the peak may well have been ascended previously by miners or American Indians.Louis W. Dawson II, Dawson's Guide to Colorado's Fourteeners: Volume I, The Northern Peaks, Blue Clover Press, 1994, , pp. 36–44. The first winter ascent of the peak was made in 1943 by Russel Keene and Howard Freedman of the 10th Mountain Division, then stationed at Camp Hale. The mining town of Holy Cross City was established in 1880 to serve the growing mining operations around the region. In 1883, the Holy Cross City Trail was built to the town, but the town was depopulated from a peak of 600 people the next year. Holy Cross can be climbed by at least four different routes, with the easiest and most common route being the North Ridge, which involves of vertical gain over and is rated YDS Class 2 for moderate scrambling. The Cross Couloir route forms the vertical portion of the famous cross feature, and provides an advanced snow climb or extreme ski descent. Photo by William Henry Jackson ~ circa 1873 Mount of the Holy Cross has a history of endangering the lives of many hikers. Although the summit on Mount of the Holy Cross is frequently reached on a long day hike, hikers have become stranded or lost through missing the right turn down the ridgeline, heading straight down and into the wilderness; research and planning of the route is important to prevent tragedies. Efforts to improve safety have been made by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative. Mount of the Holy Cross is accessible from Tigiwon Road, south of Minturn, Colorado. The Half Moon Pass Trail is the standard route to the summit of Mount of the Holy Cross via the North Ridge.

They formed in 1978 by Adolphus \\"Adi\\" Newton and Steven \\"Judd\\" Turner. Along with contemporaries Heaven 17, Clock DVA's name was inspired by the Russian- influenced Nadsat of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange. Dva is Russian for \\"two\\". History =1978–1981: White Souls in Black Suits and Thirst= Newton had previously worked with members of Cabaret Voltaire in a collective called The Studs and with Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware in a band called The Future. He formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978 with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet) (born 26 September 1952, Sheffield). Clock DVA was originally known for making a form of experimental electronic music involving treated tape loops and synthesizers such as the EMS Synthi E. Clock DVA became associated with industrial music with the 1980 release of their cassette album White Souls in Black Suits on Throbbing Gristle's Industrial Records.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 271-2 Paul Widger joined on guitar. The LP Thirst, released on Fetish Records, followed in 1981 to a favourable critical reaction, knocking Adam and the Ants' Dirk Wears White Sox from the top of the NME Indie Charts, by which time the band had combined musique concrète techniques with standard rock instrumentation. \\"4 Hours\\", the single from Thirst, was later covered by former Bauhaus bassist David J on his 1985 solo EP Blue Moods Turning Tail. The band split up in 1981, with the non-original members of the band going on to form The Box. Turner died in September 1981 due to an accidental drug overdose. =1982–1984: Advantage= In 1982, Newton formed a new version of the band. First releasing the single \\"High Holy Disco Mass\\" on the major label Polydor Records under the name DVA, the band then released the album Advantage (with singles \\"Resistance\\" and \\"Breakdown\\") under the name Clock DVA. After a European tour in 1983, however, the band split acrimoniously. Adi Newton went on to form The Anti-Group or T.A.G.C. They released several albums continuing in a similar vein to the early Clock DVA, yet more experimental. =1987–1994: Buried Dreams, Man-Amplified and Sign= In 1987, Newton reactivated DVA and invited Dean Dennis and Paul Browse back into the fold to aid Newton's use of computer aided sampling techniques which he had been developing in The Anti Group. They released Buried Dreams (1989), an electronic album which (along with its single \\"The Hacker\\") received critical acclaim as a pioneering work in the cyberpunk genre. It is also rumored to have been the CD found in Jeffrey Dahmer's stereo at the time of his arrest, according to a 1990s piece published by Alternative Press. Browse left the group in 1989 and was replaced by Robert E. Baker. The album Man-Amplified (1992), an exploration of cybernetics, was the next release. Digital Soundtracks (1992), an instrumental album, followed. Following Dennis's departure from the group, Newton and Baker produced the album Sign (1993). =1995–2007: Hiatus= After the release of Sign and related singles, Clock DVA toured Europe (line-up: Newton & Baker with Andrew McKenzie and Ari Newton) and Newton relocated to Italy. However, their Italian record label at the time, Contempo, folded which caused a number of problems. Collective, an anthology album and a box set was released in 1994. Newton began working on new material with Brian Williams, Graeme Revell (from SPK) and Paul Haslinger but continued problems with record labels eventually caused Newton and Clock DVA take a long break from the music scene. In 1998, Czech record label Nextera released a reissue of Buried Dreams, sanctioned by Dean Dennis and Paul Browse but not by Newton. =2008–present: Reactivation= Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA along with his creative partner Jane Radion Newton in 2008. Since 2011 Clock DVA has performed at several electronic music festivals and venues throughout Europe with a new line-up consisting of Newton, Maurizio \\"TeZ\\" Martinucci and Shara Vasilenko.Moonlight Festival concert review in Filth Forge In November 2011, a new Clock DVA track \\"Phase IV\\" was featured on Wroclaw Industrial Festival compilation album. In January 2012, German record label Vinyl on Demand announced Horology, a vinyl box set compilation of early (1978–1980) Clock DVA material. Later on, the demo recordings included in this box set, namely Lomticks of Time, 2nd, Sex Works Beyond Entanglement, Deep Floor and Fragment, were reissued separately early 2016. A historical overview exhibition of Clock DVA (photographs, video and audio) took place at the Melkweg cultural centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands in February/March 2012. In July 2013, a new Clock DVA album called Post-Sign was released on Anterior Research. It was produced and composed by Adi Newton in 1994–95 as an instrumental companion album to Sign, though it remained unreleased at that time due to problems with record labels. According to Adi Newton, Mute Records were set to re-release the eight Clock DVA albums remastered in a box set in 2012. In 2013, Clock DVA played at the Incubate festival in Tilburg, The Netherlands. In 2014, Clock DVA released the album Clock 2 on a USB drive through their label Anterior Research. This limited edition release consists of 3 new studio tracks and various remixes of them, in addition to 4 video files. A 12\\" called Re-Konstructor / Re-Kabaret 13 was released shortly after. A version of the release was also made available on streaming sites and for digital download. A further EP, Neo Post Sign, containing tracks recorded 1995-96 but omitted from the Post-Sign album, was released early 2015. In July 2015, another vinyl box set of early material was released on Vinyl on Demand. Horology 2 - Clockdva, The Future & Radiophonic Dvations features recordings made in late 1977 / 1978 period by Adi Newton prior to and during the formative period of development of Clock DVA, including the original The Future recordings made by the trio of Adi Newton, Martyn Ware & Ian Craig Marsh before The Future developed into The Human League and Clock DVA. In September 2016 Clock DVA performed a series of live dates in the United States.

Bentley is most known for narrating the UK version of the Dutch reality television programme Big Brother since its inception in 2000, until the series' end in 2018. He also did other continuity announcements for Channel 4 until he left in July 2011 to continue narrating the revived Big Brother on Channel 5. Bentley's voice-over work and distinctive Geordie accent has led to him becoming one of Britain's most recognised voices. Bentley has also appeared on stage and in London's Burning. Although he rarely makes public appearances, his public profile has been raised since Big Brothers revival on Channel 5. Early life Bentley was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and brought up in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. He attended East 15 Acting School. Big Brother Bentley was selected as the narrator of the Channel 4 (2000–2010) and Channel 5 (2011–2018) reality television programme Big Brother, which originated in the Netherlands, and this remains his best-known work. The producers of Big Brother gave him the job of narrator because they liked the way he said \\"Chickens\\". His most notable catchphrase is \\"Day [x] (in the Big Brother house...)\\". Bentley has narrated all nineteen series of the show to date, as well as the spin-off shows Celebrity Big Brother, Teen Big Brother, Celebrity Hijack and Ultimate Big Brother. Other work Before Big Brother, Bentley starred in several TV adaptations of Catherine Cookson's novels where he honed his now familiar Teesside accent. He also starred in several TV commercials as well as minor parts in feature films, such as Mad Dogs and Englishmen, which starred Joss Ackland, C. Thomas Howell, and Elizabeth Hurley. Aside from Big Brother, Bentley could be heard on Channel 4 as a continuity announcer until he left after ten years, when he reprised his Big Brother narrator role on the revived Channel 5 series. Another of Bentley's roles is the unseen question master on Sky One quiz show, Dirty Money. =Channel 5= From December 2011, Bentley began doing continuity links on Channel 5, complementing his role as narrator of Big Brother on the same channel.

It was adapted into the film Sphere in 1998. The story follows Norman Johnson, a psychologist engaged by the United States Navy, who joins a team of scientists assembled to examine a spacecraft of unknown origin discovered on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The novel begins as a science fiction story but quickly transforms into a psychological thriller, developing into an exploration of the nature of the human imagination. Plot summary A group of scientists (psychologist Norman Johnson; mathematician Harry Adams; zoologist Beth Halpern; astrophysicist Ted Fielding; and marine biologist Arthur Levine), along with U.S. Navy personnel, travel to a deep sea habitat at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where an enormous spacecraft has been discovered. During the descent Levine becomes claustrophobic and is returned to the surface. The other scientists arrive safely at Habitat DH-8. After their arrival and subsequent pressurization to the habitat's exotic-gas environment, the Navy sends a robot to enter the spacecraft first, which locates and opens a panel near the spacecraft door. As the robot's cameras focus on the opened panel, labels in English indicate the spacecraft is a U.S. spacecraft constructed in the future and sent through time, appearing on the seabed at least 350 years before its creation. The robot is unable to open a hatch leading further inside, forcing the team to don pressure suits and explore the spacecraft. In a large cargo hold, the team discovers a mysterious spherical object that is clearly of extraterrestrial origin. Reasoning the ship's future builders were apparently unaware that it had already been found in their past, Adams becomes convinced that the team will not survive to report their discovery. Remaining behind after the rest of the team returns to the habitat, Adams succeeds in opening and entering the sphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, a Pacific cyclone forces the supporting Naval ships to evacuate, trapping and isolating the scientists on the ocean floor for five days. Adams is found and returned to the DH-8 Habitat where he awakens with a terrible headache and little-to-no memory of how he opened the sphere or what occurred while he was inside. Immediately afterwards, the team is contacted by an intelligent, seemingly friendly alien entity that calls itself \\"Jerry\\". At first, Jerry communicates with the scientists using a numeric code transmitted to the habitat's computer. While the team struggles to communicate with Jerry, increasingly bizarre and deadly events occur, including the appearance of impossible sea creatures that Halpern claims cannot exist (such as shrimp with no digestive organs), confirmed when Jerry informs them he is \\"manifesting\\" the creatures. At this point, members of the team start to die in various attacks by giant squid, and the dwindling band of survivors struggle in their dealings with the unthinkably powerful, childlike, and temperamental alien entity. Johnson realizes he must use psychology to keep the remaining survivors alive (Johnson, Adams, Halpern). After re- translating the original code, Johnson realizes by transposition the entity's name should be \\"Harry\\" (Adams). Johnson hypothesizes that the sphere is an object which allows a person's subconscious thoughts to manifest in reality, and Harry Adams has acquired the power through entering it. (Confirmed by his childhood fear of squid, especially the giant squid in the novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, manifested in the form of a vast number of small squid and later a giant squid that attacks the DH-8 Habitat.) Johnson and Halpern sedate Adams and wait for contact to be re-established with the surface, but the manifestations continue. Halpern accuses Johnson of having entered the sphere and gaining access to the power. While unable to recall this incident, Johnson comes close to yielding, until he watches a security video of Halpern entering the sphere herself. Rejecting the notion, Halpern decides that Johnson is an imminent threat and defends herself by planting potent explosives around the spacecraft and habitat, and then attempts to suffocate Johnson by manipulating the habitat's life-support system. Escaping from the habitat, Johnson goes to the spacecraft and enters the presence of the sphere, then the sphere itself. Inside the sphere, he finds a large sea of translucent \\"foam,\\" and has a conversation in his thoughts with some sort of entity that speaks in cryptic riddles, who eventually tells Johnson that the greatest power humans possess is the ability to imagine things. After leaving the sphere, Johnson decides to escape using the submarine docked at Habitat DH-7, a nearby habitat for Navy personnel, but cannot abandon the other survivors. Now empowered in the same way as Adams and Halpern, Johnson returns to DH-8 and - using the submarine - the trio escape before the explosives set by Halpern count down and destroy the spaceship, the research habitat, and surrounding site. On the surface, confined to a decompression chamber, the trio ponder on what version of their story to tell the Navy. Realizing they could not control the power granted them by the sphere, they decide its knowledge to be too dangerous to be communicated, and resolve to use its power to remove it from themselves and alter their memories, replacing the fantastical experiences with more mundane memories of a technical failure. Johnson's final words to Halpern suggest that she potentially did not remove her power. Main characters Norman Johnson is the protagonist and a psychologist who, years earlier, was responsible for defining the operational procedures should the US ever come into contact with alien life - although he admits that he treated the request to do so as a joke at the time. These procedures were outlined in a report entitled Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact With Unknown Life Forms, often abbreviated ULF. Despite being the least physically fit team member in the context of an underwater habitat, he is arguably the most level-headed of the group. Nonetheless, Johnson takes time and trouble to convince the group to collaborate. Harold \\"Harry\\" Adams is a young, intelligent, African-American mathematician. While intellectually gifted and professionally secure, he is arrogant, unsympathetic, disdainful, and often uncooperative with the others, as a legacy of growing up as a mathematical prodigy who was often picked on as a child because of his lack of athletic talent. Elizabeth Halpern is a biochemist who is gentle and caring while simultaneously fierce, combative, and confrontational. She perceives herself as being dominated by the male scientists. Theodore Fielding is an astrophysicist and an enthusiastic opportunist, whose pretensions tend to cause conflict in his relationships with the others, despite his good intentions. It is later revealed his ambition is driven by anxiety and a conviction he has to achieve fame and do so fast, because he believes that the time for him to do so is fast running out. Arthur Levine is marine biologist and the sole member of the team not chosen by Norman. He is also the only team member who doesn't make the descent to the crash site. Harold C. Barnes is a retired Navy captain who has charge of the underwater scientific investigation. He is brusque, impatient, and distrustful - possibly as a result of his military background. This leads to conflicts with the other main characters. He withholds crucial information from the team and his crew, following his own agenda at the expense of the others with tragic consequences. Alice \\"Teeny\\" Fletcher is a Navy chief petty officer in charge of maintaining the habitat. She is friendly and competent, despite Norman's initial skepticism. It is not specifically explained how she dies, but the survivors find a trail of blood and one of her shoes after the second giant squid attack. Tina Chan is a Navy petty officer and electronics technician who is in charge of communications. She develops a friendship with Halpern, and is one of the longest surviving Navy personnel killed by the manifestations. Rose Levy is a Navy seaman who serves as the habitat's cook. Jane Edmunds is a Navy petty officer and data processing technician who serves as the operation's archivist. She is responsible for recording events and transferring the tapes to the submarine at DH-7, which is pre-programmed to return to the surface if not reset before a failsafe 12-hour countdown reaches 0, intended to ensure that at the very least a partial record will survive in case of catastrophe. Background Crichton began writing the novel in 1967 as a companion piece to The Andromeda Strain. His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he \\"didn't know where to go with it\\" and put off completing the book until a later date. > The idea of doing a story about contact with superior intelligence, a time- > honored theme, is that it's very hard if you stop and think about it.

Film The book was made into the film Sphere (1998), directed by Barry Levinson, with a cast including Dustin Hoffman (Norman Johnson, renamed Norman Goodman), Samuel L. Jackson (Harry Adams), Peter Coyote (Harold Barnes), Liev Schreiber (Ted Fielding), and Sharon Stone (Beth Halpern, renamed Beth Halperin). The film largely follows the novel, although there are differences. The film received negative reviews from critics and has been described as having \\"bombed\\" at the box office. It was rated 12% by Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus opinion: \\"Sphere features an A-level cast working with B-grade material, with a story seen previously in superior science-fiction films\\". Film critic Roger Ebert described Sphere as \\"a watered-down take on the sci-fi classic Solaris by Stanislaw Lem, which was made into an immeasurably better film by Andrei Tarkovsky\\". Reception Reviews were mostly positive for the novel (in contrast to its film adaptation). For example, The New York Times Robin McKinley wrote, \\"Part of the fun of Sphere is that it keeps you going even when you're pretty sure of what will happen next.\\" See also  * \\"\\", a short story by Jack London References External links * Category:1987 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:1987 science fiction novels Category:Techno-thriller novels Category:Novels by Michael Crichton Category:Books about cephalopods Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Alfred A.

It pitted the French army, composed of the best heavy cavalry and artillery in Europe, led by Francis I, newly crowned King of France, against the Old Swiss Confederacy, whose mercenaries until that point were regarded as the best medieval infantry force in Europe. With the French were German landsknechts, bitter rivals of the Swiss for fame and renown in war, and their late arriving Venetian allies. Background The campaign of Marignano followed years of Swiss successes, during which French fortunes in Northern Italy had suffered greatly. The Swiss had taken control of Milan (for France the gateway to Italy) after their victory at the Battle of Novara (1513), and returned to its ducal throne Massimiliano, son of Ludovico Sforza, the last duke of the House of Sforza to rule independent Milan, as their puppet. The prologue to the battle was an Alpine passage, in which Francis hauled pieces of artillery (72 huge cannons) over new-made roads over the Col d'Argentière, a previously unknown route. This was, at the time, considered one of the foremost military exploits of the age and the equal of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps. At Villafranca the French, led by Jacques de la Palice,Francesco Guicciardini, Storia d'Italia, Lib. XII, cap. 12 surprised and captured the Papal commander, Prospero Colonna, in a daring cavalry raid deep behind the allied lines (the Chevalier Bayard providing the impetus and expertise). Colonna and his staff aside, the French seized a great deal of booty on the raid, including 600 horses. The capture of Colonna, along with the startling appearance of the French army on the plains of Piedmont, stunned the allies. The Pope and the Swiss both sought terms with Francis, while the Spanish allies en route from Naples halted to await developments. The main Swiss army retreated to Milan, while a large faction, tired of the war and eager to return home with the booty of years of successful campaigning, urged terms with the French. Though the parties reached an agreement that gave Milan back to the French, the arrival of fresh and bellicose troops from the Swiss cantons annulled the agreement, as the newly arrived men had no desire to return home empty-handed and refused to abide by the treaty. Discord swept through the Swiss forces till Matthäus Schiner, cardinal of Sion and an arch- enemy of King Francis, inspired the Swiss with a fiery harangue on 13 September, reminding them of what a smaller Swiss army had achieved against as powerful a French army at the Battle of Novara. Schiner pointed out the enormous profits of victory, appealed to national pride, and urged the Swiss to immediate battle. The effect was prodigious. The suddenly enthusiastic Swiss sprang to arms, issuing forth from Milan in disciplined but frenzied columns. Battle Swiss mercenaries and German Landsknechts fighting for glory, fame, and money at Marignano (1515). The bulk of the Renaissance armies was composed of mercenaries. The battlefield of Marignano, drawing by Urs Graf, himself a Swiss mercenary who may have fought there. Rudolfus Longus à Salis, of Soglio, sometime Governor of Pavia, killed at Marignano 1515. The Swiss encountered Francis's forces at the little burnt-out village of Marignano on a featureless plain. A treaty signed, the French were not expecting battle. Francis was in his tent, trying on a new suit of armor, when scouts reported the coming of the Swiss. The French army quickly sprang into action, forming up in three divisions: the vanguard, posted slightly forward and on the right under Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, the Constable of France; the central battle, commanded by the King, slightly trailing the right; and on the left and even further back, the “rearguard” commanded by the Duke of Alençon. Each division was a combined arms force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Massed in front of Francis’ center division was a grand battery of seventy-two field guns guarded by the infamous Black Legion, or Black Band. Also with the king's division was the Chevalier Bayard and his company, the foremost lancers in the French army (and perhaps Europe). Close to sunset, the Swiss approached the French in three divisions of their own, each a dense mass of pikemen. They had no artillery or cavalry and had learned in past actions that a rapid advance into the enemy would sweep all before them. At Marignano, the battle began with a “forlorn hope” detaching from the Swiss vanguard phalanx, and with lowered pikes charging the grand battery in front of the King’s position in the center. Their intent, justified by experience in other battles, was to quickly overrun the French cannon and then turn them upon their owners. At first the Swiss attack succeeded in driving back the landsknecht defenders and capturing a few of the guns, the speed of the Swiss advance rendering their fire ineffective. But Bourbon’s cavalry from the French right counter-attacked their flank, driving the forlorn hope back to the shelter of the Swiss vanguard. The pursuing French horse were themselves routed by the oncoming Swiss mainbody. Smoke and the coming of night obscured the battle; in the moonlight and confusion, the outcome hung in the balance. Furious French cavalry charges, often led by the king himself, with Bayard at his side, succeeded time and again in throwing back temporary Swiss gains. Many of the foremost French commanders were wounded or killed in the desperate night fighting, including the Prince of Tallemont, son of Louis II de la Trémoille, who died with sixty-two wounds on his body. The Black Legion counter-attacked and threw back the Swiss, only to be repulsed in turn. Bayard had to cut his way through the Swiss phalanx to rescue the Duke of Lorraine, stranded in the dark amongst his enemies. In the darkest hours, the fighting stopped, and both armies extracted themselves and reorganized. At dawn the battle commenced again. In the French center, the grand battery had been reassembled. Opposing them, the Swiss had reformed their largest phalanx. Encouraged by the evening before, the Swiss once again lowered pikes and charged the French guns. This time the grand battery was ready for them. Massed cannon fire tore bloody furrows deep in their ranks, slowing the advance. But the undaunted Swiss continually closed ranks and pushed forward. Again, the defending German landsknechts were driven back; but the massed fire of the guns at point blank range prevented the Swiss from pushing farther forward. Still another French cavalry charge, this time led by Bayard, forced the attacking Swiss to give ground. Baffled by the artillery but as yet undaunted, the Swiss refocused their assault against Alençon’s left-wing division. After making some headway, this attack too was thrown back. In his report later to his mother, King Francis would boast that “thirty brave charges” were hurled by the French gendarmerie against the stubborn Swiss. Only the mid-morning arrival of allied Venetian forces commanded by the condottiero Bartolomeo d'Alviano turned the tide against the Swiss. Their attacks repulsed everywhere, their ranks in bloody shambles, they grudgingly gave ground and withdrew. The battle was a decisive victory for Francis. This could be considered the expected outcome, seeing as the Swiss were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. But the Swiss during the preceding decades had almost habitually emerged victorious from such disadvantageous situations, and the French victory by no means came easily, the battle hanging in the balance until the arrival of the Venetian reinforcements. The immediate causes of the Swiss defeat were their failure to capture the enemy artillery during the early phase of the battle and the arrival of the Venetians. But also contributing to the Swiss defeat were their lack of discipline and their ineffective command structure. Earlier in the same year of 1515, the Swiss diet had granted to each captain the authority to decide whether their company would continue their campaign or retreat. This made it impossible for the Swiss forces to act as a unit. The system of command consisted two captains elected as commanders-in-chief, besides the captains of the individual companies, as well as one representative elected by the men-at-arms of each canton. These commanders would vote on the policy of the Swiss army. In practice, this system broke down as soon as it was put to the test: the captains decided to honour the agreement not to attack, while the representatives of the troops, especially those of Uri, Schwyz, and Glarus, decided to attack regardless, motivated by the prospect of rich spoils. Results Contemporary depiction of the battle, attributed to the Maître à la Ratière Dying Swiss, sketch by Ferdinand Hodler (ca. 1898) for his Retreat from Marignano fresco (1900). =French side= “I have vanquished those whom only Caesar vanquished” was printed on the medal King Francis ordered struck to commemorate the victory. Considering the battle his most cherished triumph, Francis requested that he himself be knighted on the battlefield, in the ancient style, by the hand of none other than the Chevalier Bayard. Marshal Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, veteran of every war for the previous 40 years, praised Marignano as the “battle of giants” and stated that compared to it, all previous battles in his lifetime had been “child’s sport”. Marignano established the superiority of French cast bronze artillery and gendarme cavalry over the heretofore invincible phalanx tactics of the Swiss infantry. French success at Marignano, however, eventually galvanized opposition in the divided peninsula and turned the European balance of power against Francis I. In the meantime, however, Francis gained the city, and more importantly, the Castello Sforzesco within it, the strategic key to control of Lombardy. There Massimiliano Sforza and his Swiss mercenaries and the cardinal-bishop of Sion retreated, only submitting when French sappers had placed mines under the foundations. The French regained Milan, and Massimiliano went into luxurious exile with a French purse of 30,000 ducats.Canada's Digital Collections (collections.ic.gc.ca) =Swiss side= The retreating Swiss army retained control of their upper-Lombardy provinces of Bellinzona and adjacent valleys, leaving a rearguard to preside over them. The battle ended once and for all Swiss aspirations in Milan, and the Swiss Confederacy never again went to war against France or Milan. In fact, the Confederacy never went to war again at all after 1525, and (apart from the conquest of Vaud by the canton of Berne acting on its own in 1536) there never was any Swiss military offensive against an external enemy again. Swiss historiography has tended to attribute this to the \\"lesson learned\\" at Marignano, but at least as effective was the division created by the Swiss Reformation in the 1520s, dividing the Confederacy into two factions which would be occupied with internal hostilities throughout the period of the European Wars of Religion, as well as a number of painful defeats of Swiss mercenary regiments in the decade between 1515 and 1525 (at Bicocca, Sesia and Pavia). =Perpetual Peace= After lengthy negotiations, a peace treaty between the Thirteen Cantons and its allies (abbot and city of St. Gallen, Three Leagues, Valais, Mulhouse) on one hand and Francis as both King of France and Duke of Milan on the other was signed in Fribourg on 29 November 1516. In the treaty of Fribourg, known as \\"Perpetual Peace\\" (Ewiger Frieden, Paix perpétuelle), the Swiss Confederacy renounced all claims to the protectorate of Milan. In return, France paid 700,000 gold crowns in compensation to the Confederacy. Both parties agreed to abstain from giving any support to enemies of the other party (with the exception of pre-existing treaties) and agreed on an arrangement of arbitration in the case of future disputes. France offered another 300,000 crowns if the Swiss were willing to yield their transmontane territories (except for Bellinzona), but this offer was declined. The treaty furthermore granted trade privileges to the Swiss, both in Milan and in Lyon. Only the Ossola valley was passed back to Milan, while the other transmontane bailiwicks of the Swiss Confederacy remain part of Switzerland to this day, since 1803 as the canton Ticino (while the Three Leagues lost control of the Valtellina in 1797). The \\"Perpetual Peace\\" with France was indeed kept for the remainder of the lifetime of the Kingdom of France, and was broken only during the French Revolutionary Wars, with the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798. It opened a period of close ties between the Swiss Confederacy with France over the next three centuries (while at the same time Switzerland moved away from its association with the Holy Roman Empire). A next step of rapprochement to France was the service pact (Soldbündnis) with France, concluded in 1521, which made Swiss mercenary regiments a regular part of the French armed forces (see Gardes Suisses). This arrangement also outlasted three centuries, with four Swiss regiments participating in Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, foreign military service of Swiss citizens being finally outlawed in 1848 with the formation of Switzerland as a federal state. =Other= In 1515, Francis met with Pope Leo X in Bologna. This Concordat resulted in the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges being repealed, and Francis gained the power to select French bishops. Also at the meeting was Leonardo da Vinci, whom Francis persuaded to accompany him back to France, and granted him the Clos Lucé manor and a pension of 7,000 scudi. Also present at the battle was Huldrych Zwingli, who since 1506 had been church patron at Glarus. In Glarus, there was political controversy on which side the young men seeking employment as mercenaries should take service, the side of France or that of the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States. The aim was to prevent that men of Glarus took service on both sides of the war, which would result in the unhappy constellation of \\"brothers fighting brothers\\" on the battlefield, as had been the case at Novara in 1500. Zwingli had supported the Pope before Marignano, and even after the battle, he opposed the peace with France and continued to support the side of the Papal States. Since public opinion in Glarus had shifted towards a clearly pro-French stance after the peace of 1516, Zwingli was forced to abandon his position in Glarus. He took employment at Einsiedeln, and from 1519 in Zürich. Based on his experience in the Italian War, Zwingli became an outspoken opponent of mercenary service, arguing with Erasmus of Rotterdam that \\"war is sweet only to those who have not experienced it\\" (dulce bellum inexpertis). He also blamed the warmongery on the part of cardinal Schiner for the disaster at Marignano and began to preach against the \\"red caps\\" (rote hüetlin, i.e. the high clergy), the first signs of his radicalization that would culminate in the Swiss Reformation during the decade following Marignano. Legacy and commemoration Commemorating the event are a bas-relief of the Battle of Marignano by Pierre Bontemps, which decorates Francis I's tomb at Saint-Denis; a painting by Antoine Caron for Fontainebleau (now at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa); and the most famous musical composition of Clément Janequin, the chanson La guerre.

Modern naval warfare is divided into four operational areas: surface warfare, air warfare, submarine warfare and information warfare. Each area comprises specialized platforms and strategies used to exploit tactical advantages unique and inherent to that area. Surface warfare involves surface ships. Description Modern surface warfare dates from the mid-20th century, when surface, air, and submarine warfare components were blended together as a tactical unit to achieve strategic objectives. In US Navy doctrine, the two most important strategic objectives are interdiction and sea control. * Interdiction is the process of intercepting an enemy transiting through a location. For example, German naval objectives against Britain during World War II's Battle of the Atlantic were primarily focused on preventing ships from arriving intact with their cargoes. * Sea control is the dominance of force over a given area that prevents other naval forces from operating successfully. For example, the mission of the Allied navies in the Atlantic during World War II was to maintain sea control and prevent Axis naval forces from operating. The Anti-access/area denial is an opposition to enemy's sea control without itself being an attempt to gain sea control. Surface Warfare (SuW) is conducted by a surface ship eliminate a threat, which may includes Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti- Submarine Warfare (ASW), Naval Gun Fire Support (NGFS), Riverine Operations, Mine Warfare, and Electronic Warfare. In the second half of the 20th century, the importance of naval surface power was reduced as air and submarine warfare platforms demonstrated their capabilities. This lesson was brought home through the surprising results of the Battle of Taranto, the Battle of Pearl Harbor, and the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse. Following World War II, guided anti-ship missiles required new tactics and doctrines. Small, fast, relatively cheap missile boats became a threat for large ships, much more serious than previous torpedo boats. Proof of concept arrived on 20 October 1967 with the loss of an Israeli destroyer Eilat to Egyptian missile boats. Ships Surface combatant ships include battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and others. Surface combatants also include mine warfare ships, amphibious command ships, coastal defense ships, amphibious assault ships, and many others. An important facet of naval warfare are however the support ships (that is, non-combat ships): freighters, oilers, hospital ships, tugs, troop transports, and others. In the U.S. Navy model, now widespread in the world, all kinds of ships would be primarily organized into the carrier battle group.

He attempted to assassinate Hitler on 13 March 1943 and drafted the Valkyrie plan for a coup against the German government. He was described by the Gestapo as the \\"prime mover\\" and the \\"evil spirit\\" behind the plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler.Fest 1997, p. 236. He committed suicide at Królowy Most on the Eastern Front upon the plot's failure. Early life Tresckow was born in Magdeburg into a noble family from the Brandenburg region of Prussia with 300 years of military tradition that provided the Prussian Army with 21 generals.Balfour 1988, p. 124. His father, Leopold Hans Heinrich Eugen Hermann von Tresckow, later a cavalry general, had been present at Kaiser Wilhelm I's coronation as the emperor of new German Empire at Versailles in 1871. His mother, Marie-Agnes, was the youngest daughter of Count Robert von Zedlitz-Trützschler, a Prussian Minister of Education. He received most of his early education from tutors on his family's remote rural estate; from 1913 to 1917, he was a student at the Gymnasium in the town of Goslar. He joined the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards as an officer cadet at age of 16 and became the youngest lieutenant in the Army in June 1918. In the Second Battle of the Marne, he earned the Iron Cross 2nd class for outstanding courage and independent action against the enemy. At that time Count Siegfried von Eulenberg, the commander of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, predicted that \\"You, Tresckow, will either become chief of the General Staff or die on the scaffold as a rebel.\\"Profile, offizierschule-des-heeres.de; accessed 16 March 2017. Career The young Tresckow After World War I, Tresckow stayed with the famed Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam and took part in the suppression of the Spartacist movement in January 1919, but resigned from the Weimar Republic Reichswehr Army in 1920 in order to study law and economics. He worked in a banking house and embarked on a world journey visiting Britain, France, Brazil and the eastern United States in 1924 before he had to abandon it to take care of family possessions back home. Like members of many prominent Prussian families, Tresckow married into another family with long-standing military traditions. In 1926, he married Erika von Falkenhayn, only daughter of Erich von Falkenhayn, the chief of the General Staff from 1914 to 1916, and returned to military service, being sponsored by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Nevertheless, he was not a typical Prussian officer. He wore his uniform only when it was absolutely required and disliked the regimentation of army life.Michael C. Thomsett, The German Opposition to Hitler, p.163 He liked to recite Rainer Maria Rilke, and spoke several languages, including English and French.Frankfurter Allgemine Zeitung, Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager interview, May 01, 2008 In 1934, Tresckow began General Staff training at the War Academy and graduated as the best of the class of 1936. He was assigned to the General Staff's 1st Department (Operations), where he worked in close contact with Generals Ludwig Beck, Werner von Fritsch, Adolf Heusinger and Erich von Manstein. Later in 1939 and into 1940, he served as the second general staff officer of Army Group A under Gerd von Rundstedt and Erich von Manstein, culminating in the invasion of France in the spring of 1940. Tresckow played a role in the adoption of the Manstein Plan, which proved to be so successful in the French campaign. Tresckow's former regimental comrade Rudolf Schmundt was Hitler's chief military aide, and it was through the Tresckow-Schmundt channel that Manstein's plan, after being rejected by Army High Command, was brought to Hitler's attention.Fest 1997, pp. 289–290. He is also said to have worked on developing the Manstein Plan itself as Günther Blumentritt's deputy.Barnett 2003, p. 187. After the fall of France, he did not share the euphoria that swept Germany and brought Hitler to the peak of his popularity. In October, he said in Paris to a secretary (the future wife of Alfred Jodl), \\"If Churchill can induce America to join in the war, we shall slowly but surely be crushed by material superiority. The most that will be left to us then will be the Electorate of Brandenburg, and I'll be chief of the palace guard.\\"Balfour 1988, p. 126. From 1941 to 1943, he served under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, his wife's cousin, and later Field Marshal Günther von Kluge as chief operations officer of the German Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, in October and November 1943, he served in combat as the commanding officer of Grenadier Regiment 442, defending the western bank of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. From December 1943 until his death in 1944, he served as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, in areas which are now Belarus and eastern Poland. Heu Aktion As Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, Tresckow signed an order on 28 June 1944 to abduct Polish and Ukrainian children in the so-called Heu- Aktion (Hay Action). Between 40,000 and 50,000 Polish and Ukrainian children aged 10 to 14 were kidnapped for Nazi Germany's forced labour programme.Men of 20 July and the War in the Soviet Union Christian Gerlach in War Of Extermination: The German Military In World War II page 139 The order read in part \\"In operations against gangs, any boys and girls taken between ages 10 and 13 who are physically healthy, and whose parents either cannot be located or who, as persons unable to work, are to be sent to the area earmarked for remaining families (the dregs are to be sent to the Reich).\\"Gerlach p.139 The kidnapped children were used as forced workers in the Todt organisation, Junkers factories and in German handicrafts as part of an operation to \\"lower biological strength\\" of the enemies of Nazi Germany. Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany has been classified by the Nuremberg Tribunal as part of a systematic programme of genocide.http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/05/NMT05-T0089.htm Alfred Rosenberg, who also signed the documents for Heu Aktion, was found guilty by the Nuremberg Tribunal, and his signing of the document was mentioned in the final verdict. Opposition to Hitler Although he was initially an enthusiastic supporter of Nazism because it opposed the Treaty of Versailles, he was quickly disillusioned by 1934 when the Schutzstaffel (SS) extrajudicially murdered many SA leaders and political opponents, including two generals, in the Night of the Long Knives (30 June to 2 July 1934). The events of the 1930s, such as the 1938 Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, further strengthened his antipathy to the Nazis. He regarded the Kristallnacht (state-sanctioned, nationwide pogrom of Jews) as personal humiliation and degradation of civilization.Scheurig 2004, p. 77. He therefore sought out civilians and officers who opposed Hitler, such as Erwin von Witzleben, who dissuaded Tresckow from resigning from the Army, arguing that they would be needed when the day of reckoning came.Barnett 2003, p. 47. By the summer of 1939, he told Fabian von Schlabrendorff that \\"both duty and honor demand from us that we should do our best to bring about the downfall of Hitler and National Socialism to save Germany and Europe from barbarism.\\"Hoffmann 1996, p. 265. In the campaign against the Soviet Union, Tresckow resumed his resistance activities with renewed urgency. He was appalled by the Commissar Order, of which he said: > Remember this moment. If we don't convince the field marshal (Fedor von > Bock) to fly to Hitler at once and have these orders (Commissar Order) > canceled, the German people will be burdened with a guilt the world will not > forget in a hundred years. This guilt will fall not only on Hitler, Himmler, > Göring, and their comrades but on you and me, your wife and mine, your > children and mine, that woman crossing the street, and those children over > there playing ball.Kane 2008, p.163. He was likewise incensed by the treatment of Russian prisoners of war, and in particular by the mass shootings of Jewish women and children by the Einsatzgruppen behind the lines.Fest 1997, p.175Kane 2008, p.163 When Tresckow learned about the massacre of thousands of Jews at Borisov, Tresckow appealed passionately to Field Marshal Fedor von Bock: \\"Never may such a thing happen again! And so we must act now. We have the power in Russia!\\"Scheurig 2004, p. 126. Army Group Centre staff included Lieutenant Colonel Georg Schulze- Büttger, Colonel Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, Major Carl-Hans Graf von Hardenberg, Lieutenant Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort, Lieutenant von Schlabrendorff, Lieutenant Philipp von Boeselager and his brother Georg von Boeselager, Lieutenant Colonel Hans-Alexander von Voss and Lieutenant Colonel Berndt von Kleist among others, many of them from Tresckow's old Infantry Regiment 9. The headquarters of Army Group Centre thus emerged as the new nerve centre of Army resistance.Hoffmann 1996, pp. 265–266. At the end of September 1941, Tresckow sent his special operations officer Schlabrendorff to Berlin to contact opposition groups and declare that the staff of Army Group Centre was \\"prepared to do anything.\\" This approach, made at the height of German expansion and the nadir of anti-Hitler opposition, represented the first initiative to come from the front and from the Army, as Ulrich von Hassell noted in his diary.Hoffmann 1996, p. 269. Schlabrendorff continued to serve as liaison between Army Group Centre and opposition circle around General Ludwig Beck, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Colonel Hans Oster, the deputy head of Abwehr (German military intelligence) who was involved in a 1938 coup attempt against Hitler (Oster Conspiracy). Oster's recruitment of General Friedrich Olbricht, head of the General Army Office headquarters, in 1942 linked this asset to Tresckow's resistance group in Army Group Centre, creating a viable coup apparatus.Fest 1997, p. 188. Plots against Hitler It was decided that Tresckow's group would assassinate Hitler and thereby provide the 'spark' for the coup, which Olbricht would direct from Berlin. In late 1942, Olbricht indicated that he still needed about eight weeks to complete preparations for the coup. Shortly thereafter, Tresckow traveled to Berlin to discuss the few remaining questions and emphasize that time was running short.Fest 1997, p. 192. In the winter of 1942, Olbricht declared: \\"We are ready. The spark can now be set off.\\"Von Schlabrendorff 1994, p. 227. Tresckow assured the conspirators that he would take action at the first available opportunity. It came on 13 March 1943, when Hitler finally visited troops on the Eastern Front at Smolensk after a few cancellations and postponements. Under the initial plan, a group of officers were to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal in the officers' mess during lunch but Kluge, Commander of Army Group Center, who had been informed about the plot, urged Tresckow not to carry it out saying, \\"For heaven's sake, don't do anything today! It's still too soon for that!\\"Fest 1997, p. 193. He argued that the German army and people were not ready to accept the coup and would not understand such an act. He also feared a civil war between the Army and SS, since Heinrich Himmler had canceled his visit and could not be killed at the same time.Philipp von Boeselager, Daily Telegraph book review of Valkyrie: the Plot to Kill Hitler by Philipp von Boeselager, February 5, 2008. Tresckow, however, had a backup plan. During the lunch in question, he asked Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Brandt, who was travelling with Hitler, whether he would be good enough to take a bottle of Cointreau to Colonel Helmuth Stieff (who was not yet a conspirator at that time) at Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia as a payment for a lost bet. Brandt readily agreed. The \\"Cointreau\\" was actually a bomb constructed of a British plastic explosive \\"Plastic C\\" placed into the casing of a British magnetic mine, with a timer consisting of a spring which would be gradually dissolved by acid. Before Hitler's Condor plane was to take off, Schlabrendorff activated the 30-minute fuse and handed the package to Brandt, who boarded Hitler's plane. After takeoff, a message was sent to the other Berlin conspirators by code that Operation Flash was under way, which they expected to take place around Minsk. Yet when Hitler landed safely at his East Prussian headquarters, it became obvious that the bomb had failed to detonate (the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment probably prevented the fuse from working). The message of failure was quickly sent out and Schlabrendorff retrieved the package to prevent discovery of the plot.Fest 1997, p. 194. A week later, on 21 March, Army Group Centre organised a display of Russian Army flags and weapons seized at the Eastern Front. It was exhibited at Zeughaus, military museum in Berlin, which Hitler was to visit on Heroes' Memorial Day with Himmler and Hermann Göring. Colonel Gersdorff volunteered to be the suicide bomber, intending to explode a bomb on his person near Hitler while serving as a tour guide. He had with him bombs with ten-minute fuses, knowing that Hitler was scheduled to be in the museum for 30 minutes. But at the last minute, just before Hitler was to arrive, the duration of his stay was reduced to just eight minutes as a security precaution. Hitler breezed through in two minutes. As a result, Gersdorff could not accomplish his mission, the assassination plan failed again and he barely managed to get out and defuse the bombs.Fest 1997, p. 196. Other plots similarly failed because of Hitler's good luck and irregular habits. Most importantly, they had no access to Hitler since he no longer visited the front, rarely visited Berlin and spent most of his time at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia or the Berghof in Bavaria. Tresckow lacked the required clearance to enter either site and the extremely high security made any attempt impractical and unlikely to succeed. The elimination of Oster's group in April 1943 (his deputy Hans von Dohnanyi and Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer were arrested, and Oster was placed under house arrest) was a further setback. Tresckow worked tirelessly to persuade army commanders such as Field Marshals Fedor von Bock, Günther von Kluge and Erich von Manstein to join in the conspiracy without much success. With unwitting help from Schmundt, he placed like-minded officers as their adjutants and staff officers to bring them closer to the conspiracy. Kluge sympathised with the conspirators and at times seemed ready to act, only to become indecisive at critical moments. Others refused outright, Manstein declaring, \\"Prussian field marshals do not mutiny.\\" Nonetheless, no-one reported their treasonable activities to the SS. Erika and Henning von Tresckow Operation Valkyrie Eventually, the conspirators came to rely more on the Reserve Army in Berlin and other districts to stage a coup against the German government. Olbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The Reserve Army had an operational plan called Operation Walküre (Valkyrie), which was to be used in the event that the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order, or an uprising by the millions of slave laborers from occupied countries now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilize the Reserve Army to take control of German cities, disarm the SS and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated. During August and September 1943, Tresckow took extended sick leave in Berlin to draft the \\"revised\\" Valkyrie plan with fine details and precise timetables. Revised orders and additional proclamations that would pin the blame for the uprising on the Nazi party were typed by Tresckow's wife, Erika, and his secretary, Countess Margarete von Oven, who wore gloves so as not to leave fingerprints.Fest 1997, p. 220. These 1943 papers were recovered by the Soviets after the war and finally published in 2007, showing Tresckow's central role in the conspiracy and the idealistic motivations of the resistance group at that time. Knowledge of the Jewish Holocaust was a major impetus for many officers involved.Peter Hoffmann, \\"Oberst i. G. Henning von Tresckow und die Staatsstreichpläne im Jahr 1943\\" But when Tresckow was assigned to command of a battalion on the Eastern Front in October 1943, he was no longer in position to actively plan or effect the coup. Even his promotion a month later to Chief of Staff of the Second Army did not bring him much closer. To gain access to Hitler, he proposed to his old comrade General Rudolf Schmundt, Hitler's chief adjutant and Army personnel chief, to create a new department of psychological and political warfare to evaluate data and make reports directly to the Führer. Schmundt, who was still well disposed toward his old friend but suspected that Tresckow disapproved of the Führer, quietly let the matter drop. Tresckow also applied to become General Adolf Heusinger's delegate in the Army High Command (OKH) during the latter's two- month leave, which would also give him access to Hitler's meetings, but Heusinger, who was earlier approached by conspirators, rejected it apparently for the same reason.Fest 1997, p. 226. Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who met Tresckow in August 1943 and worked together on revising Operation Valkyrie, took the responsibility for planning and implementing Hitler's assassination. By the time Stauffenberg was appointed Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army and was ready to carry out the assassination attempt, the Allies had already landed in Normandy. When Stauffenberg sent a message to Tresckow through Lehndorff to ask whether there was any point in making the attempt since there was no practical purpose to be served, Tresckow urged him not only to attempt the assassination but to go ahead with the coup in Berlin even if the assassination were to fail. He argued that there must be an overt act of German opposition to Hitler regardless of the consequences. He also told Philipp von Boeselager and Margarete von Oven that 16,000 people were being killed daily not as casualties of war but from being murdered by the Germans, and Hitler had to be killed just to put an end to it. A few days before the coup attempt, Tresckow confided to a friend that \\"in all likelihood everything will go wrong\\". When asked whether the action was necessary nonetheless, he replied, \\"Yes, even so.\\"Fest 1997, p. 340. Death When the assassination attempt on Hitler and the following coup in Berlin (the 20 July plot) had failed, Tresckow decided to commit suicide at the front in Królowy Most near Białystok on 21 July. His parting words to Schlabrendorff were: To protect other conspirators, he staged an appearance of partisan attack by firing his pistols and then dispatched himself by holding a hand grenade below his chin and detonating it. He was buried in the family home in Wartenberg. When the Nazis learned about his connections in late August, his body was exhumed and taken to the crematorium in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His wife was arrested on 15 August, and her children taken away under the Nazi policy of Sippenhaft (shared family guilt); however, early in October she was released and survived the war.Balfour 1988, p. 132. Memorial plaque for Erich Hoepner and Tresckow in the Bundeshaus, Berlin Personal Life In 1926, Tresckow married Erika von Falkenhayn, the daughter of Prussian general Erich von Falkenhayn and his wife Ida Selkmann. General von Falkenhayn served as Prussian Minister of War during World War I as well as Chief of German General Staff. Tresckow and von Falkenhayn had four children, Mark, born 1927, Rüdiger, born 1928, Uta, born 1931 and Adelheid, born 1939. After his suicide, his wife and daughters were arrested. His sons were already serving in the military. Mark would die in military service in 1945, almost a year after his father's suicide. The daughters were detained in a children's home in Bad Sachsa, Germany, together with several other children of the leaders of the 20 July plot. Quotes *\\"The assassination must be attempted at all costs. Even if it should not succeed, an attempt to seize power in Berlin must be made.

Compared to this objective, nothing else is of consequence.\\" (1944) *\\"Remember this moment.

He served as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1993 to 1996. Edwards was born in Kingston, Ontario and was educated at Trent University and Queen's University. He later worked as a barrister and solicitor. In 1988, Edwards was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Winnipeg riding of St. James, defeating his closest competitor, Progressive Conservative Jae Eadie, by 579 votes. He joined 19 other Liberals in forming the official opposition to the minority government of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon. The 1988 election was a landmark for the Manitoba Liberal Party, in that it had previously been reduced to a marginal presence in the province. The unpopularity of Howard Pawley's New Democratic government in 1988 had given the party the support of many centre-left voters, and many believed that the Liberals had a chance to form government in the next election. This did not occur. The New Democratic Party recovered under Gary Doer's leadership, and the Liberals were reduced to only seven seats (out of 57) in the election of 1990. Edwards was re-elected in St. James, this time defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Joanne Thibault by 295 votes. Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs was blamed by many in the party for squandering a chance to form government, and resigned as party leader in 1993. Subsequently, Edwards defeated MLA Kevin Lamoureux to become the party's new leader. The Liberals initially appeared to have a reasonable chance of winning the 1995 election, placing a strong second to the Tories in early polls. They ran a poor campaign, however, and the NDP overtook them well before election day. The Liberals fell to three seats in the election of 1995: Lamoureux was re-elected in his constituency of Inkster, as were Neil Gaudry in St. Boniface and Gary Kowalski in The Maples. In another close race in St. James, Edwards lost to New Democratic candidate MaryAnn Mihychuk by 166 votes. He announced his resignation as party leader later in the year. He formally resigned in 1996, and subsequently returned to a legal practice. Edwards is married to Anne MacKay. They have four children: Beth, Evan, Wynn and Adam.

It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula near the modern-day town of Valdivia, Ecuador between 3500 BCE and 1500 BCE. Culture Valdivian pottery is one of the oldest in the Americas. Valdivian pottery in the Museo de La Plata (Argentina). Mortar, Jaguar Valdivia, South Coast (4000 BCE to 1500 BCE). Mortar, Parrot Valdivia, South Coast (4000 BCE to 1500 BCE). Remains of the Valdivia culture were discovered in 1956 on the western coast of Ecuador by the Ecuadorian archeologist Emilio Estrada, who continued to study this culture. American archeologists Clifford Evans and Betty Meggers joined him in the early 1960s in studying the type-site. The Valdivia lived in a community that built its houses in a circle or oval around a central plaza. They were believed to have a relatively egalitarian culture of sedentary people who lived mostly off fishing, though they did some farming and occasionally hunted for deer to supplement their diet. From the archeological remains that have been found, it has been determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, chili peppers and cotton plants. The latter was processed, spun and woven to make clothing. Valdivian pottery, dated to 2700 BCE, initially was rough and practical, but it became splendid, delicate and large over time. They generally used red and gray colors, and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In their ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works. The trademark Valdivia piece is the \\"Venus\\" of Valdivia: feminine ceramic figures. The \\"Venus\\" of Valdivia likely represented actual people, as each figurine is individual and unique, as expressed in the hairstyles. The figures were made joining two rolls of clay, leaving the lower portion separated as legs and making the body and head from the top portion. The arms were usually very short, and in most cases were bent towards the chest, holding the breasts or under the chin. A display of Valdivian artifacts is located at Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Influences on Valdivia culture Female figurine; 2600-1500 BCE; ceramic; 11 x 2.9 x 1.6 cm (4 x 1 x in.); Brooklyn Museum (New York City) Ceramic phase A of the Valdivia was long thought to be the oldest pottery produced by a coastal culture in South America, dated to 3000-2700 BCE. In the 1960s, a team of researchers proposed there were significant similarities between the archeological remains and pottery styles of Valdivia and those of the ancient Jōmon culture, active in this same period on the island of Kyūshū, Japan). They compared both decoration and vessel shape, pointing to techniques of incising. The Early to Middle Jomon pottery had antecedents dating 10,000 years, but the Valdivia pottery style seemed to have developed rather quickly.Stuart J. Fiedel, Prehistory of the Americas, Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp. 187-189 In 1962 three archeologists, Ecuadorian Emilio Estrada and Americans Clifford Evans and Betty Meggers suggested that Japanese fishermen had gotten blown to Ecuador in a storm and introduced their ceramics to Valdivia at that time. Their theory was based on the idea of diffusion of style and techniques. Their concept was challenged at the time by other archaeologists, who argued that there were strong logistical challenges to the idea that Japanese could have survived what would have been nearly a year and a half voyage in dugout canoes. The cultures were separated by a distance of 15,000 km (8,000 nautical miles). Researchers argued that Valdivia ceramics (and culture) had developed independently, and those apparent similarities were a result simply of constraints on technique, and an \\"accidental convergence\\" of symbols and style. In the 1970s, what is believed widely to be conclusive evidence refuting the diffusion theory was found at the Valdivia type-site, as older pottery and artifacts were found below these excavations. Researchers found what is called San Pedro pottery, pre-dating Phase A and the Valdivia style. It was more primitive. Some researchers believe pottery may have been introduced by people from northern Colombia, where comparably early pottery was found at the Puerto Hormiga archaeological site. In addition, they think that the maize at Valdivia was likely introduced by people living closer to Meosamerica, where it was domesticated. In addition, other pottery remains of the San Pedro style were found at sites about 5.6 miles (9 km) up the river valley. Additional research at both several coastal sites, including San Pablo, Real Alto, and Salango, and Loma Alta, Colimes, and San Lorenzo del Mate inland have resulted in a major rethinking of Valdivian culture. It has been reclassified as representing a \\"tropical forest culture\\" with a riverine settlement focus. There has been major re-evaluation of nearly every aspect of its culture.

Breed clubs also maintain important records, and provide members with information. Many breed associations also have a social component, organising various activities such as shows. In addition, they may regulate breeding or raise funds for research related to the breed. = Examples = *In horses, the Appaloosa Horse Club, established in 1938, maintains a registry for Appaloosa horses, and has the goal of \\"preserving the horses’ heritage and history\\" and defining the horse breed through bloodline requirements.The Appaloosa Horse Club, 2009 *The Canadian Lowline Cattle Association defines its objectives as including \\"maintain the purity and improve the breed\\" of cattle as well as collecting maintaining breed information and publishing a Herd Book. *The Essex Pig Society is building up the numbers of the Essex Pig, formerly thought to be an extinct breed of the domestic pig. “Jimmy’s Farm” 22-Apr-05 *The American Buttercup Club defines its goal as connecting fanciers of the chicken breed so that they are \\"able to share stock and valuable information about the breed.\\"American Buttercup Club, The Crown of the Fancy *The Fantail Club UK, established in 1889, promotes the knowledge and enjoyment of the exhibition Fantail Pigeon in the United Kingdom.The Fantail Club *In cats, the Selkirk Rex Breed Club maintains a history of the breed and provides care and grooming tips to owners of the breed.Selkirk Rex Breed *Members of the dog breed club for the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) are expected to \\"conduct themselves in a responsible and sportsman-like manner at all times.\\"English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) Club *The OEGB Int'l Society proudly connects hobbyists of Old English Game Bantams from all around the world to discuss poultry related topics. In addition, it hosts the only US based OEGB futurity as an annual event called the MegaSpur.OEGB Int'l Society  Forming a breed club  With the advent of the internet, anyone can create a \\"breed club\\" by putting up a web page to advertise their animals. Buyers must research any claims of unaffiliated breed clubs.  Organizations covering groups of breeds  Breeds of animals of a particular species may have an organization that covers a large number of breeds of the species, even though each individual breed may have its own breed club. Often the multiple-breed over-association will maintain the breed records in a central location. An example of this would be the Canadian Sheep Breeder's Association, incorporated under the Canadian Livestock Pedigree Act in 1915, which includes fifty different breeds of sheep.  Other types of animal associations  Associations that include all breeds (as well as crossbred and mixed breed animals) of a particular species also exist. Usually such associations are organized for particular sports, such as hunting with raptors.

It will be hosted at the United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum, opening in April 2020 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Hall of Fame was established by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee in 1979; the first members were inducted in 1983. Between 1992 and 2003, the Hall of Fame went dormant, with no induction of new members. In 2004, the honor was revived, and continued in 2005 when the Class of 2006 was selected. The current process for selecting inductees is two- staged. Fifteen finalists are selected by a nominating committee consisting of athletes, members of the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, historians and USOC representatives. The inductees were then selected based on online voting at www.usolympicteam.com, with a requirement to select five individual athletes, one team, one Paralympian and one coach. When the inductees are announced, a veteran and a \\"special contributor\\" are also included. According to a 2012 press release, total membership has been brought to 96 Olympians, five Paralympians, 10 teams, four coaches, 10 veterans, 16 contributors and two Olive Branch award inductees.

It had three toes on each foot and is the first horse known to have grazed. Discovery and naming Restoration of Merychippus insignis Merychippus was named by Joseph Leidy (1856). Numerous authors assigned the type species – Merychippus insignis – to Protohippus, but this is ignored. It was assigned to the Equidae by Leidy (1856) and Carroll (1988), and to the Equinae by MacFadden (1998) and Bravo-Cuevas and Ferrusquía-Villafranca (2006).R. L. Carroll. 1988.

Merychippus (Mammalia, Perissodactyla, Equidae) from the Middle Miocene of state of Oaxaca, southeastern Mexico. Géobios 39:771-784 Its name means \\"ruminant horse\\", but current evidence does not support Merychippus ruminating. Description M. sejunctus front and back feet (right) and M. sphenodus lower jaw fragment Merychippus lived in groups. It was about tall and at the time it was the tallest equine to have existed. Its muzzle was longer, deeper jaw, and eyes wider apart than any other horse-like animal to date. The brain was also much larger, making it smarter and more agile. Merychippus was the first equine to have the distinctive head shape of today's horses. The Miocene was a time of drastic change in environment, with woodlands transforming into grass plains.MacFadden, B. J.. 1992. Fossil Horses: Systematics, Paleobiology, and Evolution of the Family Equidae. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. This led to evolutionary changes in the hooves and teeth of equids. A change in surface from soft, uneven mud to hard grasslands meant there was less need for increased surface area.MacFadden, B. J.. 1992. Fossil Horses: Systematics, Paleobiology, and Evolution of the Family Equidae. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The foot was fully supported by ligaments, and the middle toe developed into a hoof that did not have a pad on the bottom. In some Merychippus species, the side toes were larger, whereas in others, they had become smaller and only touched the ground when running. The transformation into plains also meant Merychippus began consuming more phytolith rich plants. This led to the presence of hypsodont teeth. Such teeth range from medium to intense crown height, are curved, covered in large amounts of cement, and are characteristic of grazing animals Matthew, W. D.. 1926. The Evolution of the Horse: A Record and Its Interpretation. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 1:139–185. Equid size also increased, with Merychippus ranging, on average, between 71 and 100.6 kg.MacFadden, B. J. 1986. Fossil horses from “Eohippus” (Hyracotherium) to Equus: scaling, Cope's Law, and the evolution of body size. Paleobiology, 12:355–369. Classification By the end of the Miocene era, Merychippus was one of the first quick grazers. It gave rise to at least 19 different species of grazers, which can be categorized into three major groups. This burst of diversification is often known as the \\"Merychippine radiation\\". The first was a series of three-toed grazers known as hipparions. These were very successful and split into four genera and at least 16 species, including small and large grazers and browsers with large and elaborate facial fossae. The second was a group of smaller horses, known as protohippines, which included Protohippus and Calippus. The last was a line of \\"true equines\\" in which the side toes were smaller than those of other proto-horses. In later genera, these were lost altogether as a result of the development of side ligaments that helped stabilize the middle toe during running.

The venture's successor, the revived Sony Music, is wholly owned by Sony, following their buyout of the remaining 50% held by Bertelsmann. BMG was instead rebuilt as BMG Rights Management on the basis of 200 remaining artists. History Sony BMG Music Entertainment began as the result of a 50–50 joint venture between Sony Music (part of Sony) and Bertelsmann Music Group (part of Bertelsmann) completed on March 4, 2004. It is one of the Big Four music companies and includes ownership and distribution of recording labels such as Arista Records, Columbia Records, Epic Records, J Records, Mchenry Records, Jive Records, RCA Victor Records, RCA Records, Legacy Recordings, Sonic Wave America and others. The merger affected all Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group companies worldwide except for Japan, where it was felt that it would reduce competition in that country's music industry significantly. Financial analysts covering the merger anticipated that up to 2,000 jobs would be cut as a result, saving Sony BMG approximately $350 million annually. The company's chief executive officer (CEO) is Rolf Schmidt- Holtz, who succeeded Andrew Lack on February 10, 2006. In the first half of 2005, the company's share of new releases in the United States (US) declined from 33% to 26% according to Nielsen SoundScan. This, and Lack's negotiation of what some called an \\"ill-conceived\\" deal with Bruce Springsteen led to Bertelsmann informing Sony that it would not renew Lack's contract. The company signed a content deal with the popular video sharing community YouTube. On August 5, 2008 Sony Corporation agreed to buy Bertelsmann AG's 50 percent stake in the music company for $1.2 billion to get full control. The music company was renamed Sony Music Entertainment and became a unit of Sony Corporation of America. This allowed Sony the rights to artists on the current and historic BMG roster and allowed Sony Corporation to better integrate its functions with its PlayStation 3 and upcoming new media initiatives. As part of the buyout, Bertelsmann kept the rights to master recordings by 200 artists, which formed the basis for a second version of BMG. Sony and Bertelsmann last teamed up in 2013, in a failed bid to acquire Parlophone from Universal Music Group. BMG would administer the label's back catalogue, while its current artists would sign with Sony. While Sony BMG failed to win Parlophone (which ultimately went to Warner Music Group), BMG acquired Mute Records' back catalogue and licensed Depeche Mode and the catalogue of The Echo Label to Sony. Controversies =Payola fine= In July 2005, Sony BMG was fined $10 million after the New York Attorney General's office determined that they had been practicing payola mostly in the form of direct payments to radio stations and bribes to disc jockeys to promote various artists including Franz Ferdinand, Audioslave, and mainly Jessica Simpson. Epic Records, one of their labels, was specifically cited for using fake contests in order to hide the fact that the gifts were going to disc jockeys rather than listeners. =Rootkit scandal= On 31 October 2005, a scandal erupted over digital rights management (DRM) software produced and shipped by Sony BMG that automatically installed itself on people's computers and made them more vulnerable to computer viruses. The scandal and attendant controversy about the practice of software auto-installation spawned several lawsuits. Sony BMG eventually recalled all of the affected CDs. On November 16, 2005, US-CERT, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, issued an advisory on Extended Copy Protection DRM, citing the XCP use of rootkit technology to hide certain files from the computer user as a security threat to computer users, saying that a Sony-provided uninstallation option also introduced computer system vulnerabilities. US-CERT advised, \\"Do not install software from sources that you do not expect to contain software, such as an audio CD.\\" In its \\"Top Flops of '05\\" issue, the enterprise newsweekly eWeek had to create a new category for the \\"Sony BMG root-kit fiasco.\\" Peter Coffee, of eWeek Labs reported, \\"The Sony brand name was already in trouble—it lost 16 percent of its value between 2004 and 2005.... Now it has taken a blow among tech-product opinion leaders. \\"We've never done it before, and we hope we'll never have [an] occasion to do it again but, for 2005, eWeek Labs awards a Stupid Tech Trick grand prize to Sony.\\" eWeek Vol. 22, No.50 =Kazaa file-sharing lawsuit= In October 2007, Sony BMG, alongside other large music firms, successfully sued Jammie Thomas for making 24 songs available for download on the Kazaa file-sharing network. Thomas, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,000 in damages. Thomas had allegedly shared 1702 files in total; the court upholding the award called it an \\"aggravated case of willful infringement\\". =Children's online privacy violations= In 2008, the Federal Trade Commission sued Sony BMG for collecting and displaying personal data of 30,000 minors without parental consent via its websites since 2004, violating the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Sony did not restrict minor children's participation in its websites. Sony paid a $1 million fine.

Feral cats may breed over dozens of generations and become an aggressive apex predator in urban, savannah and bushland environments. Some feral cats may become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them, but even with long-term attempts at socialization, they usually remain aloof and are most active after dusk. Feral cats are devastating to wildlife, and conservation biologists consider them to be one of the worst invasive species on Earth. Attempts to control feral cat populations are widespread but generally of greatest impact within purpose-fenced reserves. Some animal-rights groups advocate trap- neuter-return programs to prevent the cats from continuing to breed, as well as feeding the cats, socializing and adopting out young kittens, and providing healthcare. Others advocate euthanasia. Feral cats may live outdoors in colonies: these are regarded as managed colonies by animal rights advocates when they are provided with regular food and care by humans. Definitions Feral cats in Largo di Torre Argentina, Rome. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1969. The meaning of the term feral cat varies between professions and countries, and is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms such as free-roaming, street, alley, or community cat. Some of these terms are also used to refer to stray cats, although stray and feral cats are generally considered to be different by rescuers, veterinarians, and researchers. The lines between stray and feral cat are diffuse. The general idea is that owned cats that wander away from their homes may become stray cats, and stray cats that have lived in the wild for some time may become feral. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, a feral cat is defined as a cat that chooses not to interact with humans, survives with or without human assistance, and hides or defends itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled. Animal rescuers and veterinarians consider cats to be feral when they had not had much human contact particularly before eight weeks of age, avoid humans, and prefer to escape rather than attack a human. Feral cats are distinguished from domesticated cats based on their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and on the amount of fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult feral cats could potentially be tamed. = Italy = In Italy, feral cats have been protected since 1991, and it is illegal to kill them. In Rome, they are surgically neutered by veterinarians of the Veterinary Public Services. Programs for sterilization of stray cats are also implemented in the Padua and Venice Provinces. =United States= A survey of rescue and veterinarian facilities in the United States revealed that no widely accepted definition of a feral cat exists. Many facilities used waiting periods to evaluate whether a cat was feral by observing whether the cat became less afraid and evasive over time. Other indicators included the cat's response to touch with an inanimate object, and observation of the cats' social behavior in varying environments such as response to human contact, with a human nearby, or when moved to a quieter environment. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals defines community cats as either cats that were born and raised in the wild, or domestic cats that have been abandoned or lost and turned feral in order to survive. =Australia= The Australian government categorizes cats who have no interaction with or assistance from humans as feral, and unowned cats who rely on humans as semi- feral or stray. However, even these so-called 'managed colonies' often have a devastating impact on wildlife as demonstrated in the decimation of native mammals in adjacent reserves, such as occurred with numbats and woylies in Western Australia.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-22/numbats-and-woylies- flourish-at-dryandra-after-feral-cat-fight/11532040 = Farm cat = A farm cat A farm cat is a free-ranging domestic cat that lives in a cat colony on agricultural farms in a feral or semi-feral condition. Farm cats primarily live outdoors and usually shelter in barns. They are partially supplied with food and milk, but mainly subsist on hunting rodents such as black rat, brown rat, common vole and Apodemus species. In England, farm cat colonies are present on the majority of farms and consist of up to 30 cats. Female farm cats show allomothering behaviour; they use communal nests and take care of kittens of other colony members. Some animal rescue organizations maintain Barn Cat Programs and rehome neutered feral cats to people who are looking for barn cats. =Ship's cat= Domestic cats have been members of ship crews since the beginning of commercial navigation. Phoenician and Etruscan traders probably carried cats on board their trading vessels to Italy and the Mediterranean islands. History Cats in ancient Egypt were venerated for killing rodents and venomous snakes. The need to keep rodents from consuming or contaminating grain crops stored for later human consumption may be the original reason that cats were domesticated. The spread of cats throughout much of the world is thought to have originated in Egypt. Scientists do not agree on whether cats were domesticated in Ancient Egypt or introduced there after domestication. Phoenician traders brought them to Europe for control of rat populations, and monks brought them further into Asia. Roman armies also contributed spreading cats and eventually brought them to Britain. Since then, cats continued to be introduced to new countries, often by sailors or settlers. Cats are thought to have been introduced to Australia in either the 1600s by Dutch shipwrecks, or the late 1700s by English settlers. These domesticated cats began to form feral populations after their offspring began living away from human contact. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cat specimens were described as wildcat subspecies that are considered feral cat populations today: *Felis lybica var sarda proposed by Fernand Lataste in 1885 was a skin and a skull of a male cat from Sarrabus in Sardinia that looked like an African wildcat (Felis lybica), but was more reddish, gray and brown and had longer hair on the back. In the 1980s, Colin Groves assessed values of Schauenberg's index of cat skulls of zoological specimens that originated in the Mediterranean islands. Based on these values, he concluded that Sardinian wild cats are descendants of African wildcats that were introduced from North Africa's Maghreb region. Results of zooarchaeological research indicate that Sardinian wild cats descended from domestic cats that were introduced around the beginning of the 1st millennium during the Roman Empire, probably from the Near East. *Felis reyi proposed by Louis Lavauden in 1929 was a skin and a skull of a specimen from Biguglia in Corsica that was smaller and darker than the European wildcat (Felis silvestris), had a much shorter tail than the African wildcat and differed in fur colour and markings from both. When Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed Felis skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London, he considered Felis reyi a synonym of Felis lybica sarda, the Sardinian wild cat. The Corsican wildcat is considered to have been introduced in the early 1st millennium. The earliest known fossil records of cats date to the early 14th century, but older chronostratigraphic layers revealed fossils of livestock introduced since the Iron Age. *Felis lybica jordansi proposed by Ernst Schwarz in 1930 was a skull and skin of a male specimen from Santa Margarita in Mallorca that had more pronounced stripes than the African wildcat. This is also considered to have descended from domestic cats introduced to the island. *Felis silvestris cretensis proposed by Theodor Haltenorth in 1953 was a cat skin purchased in a bazaar in Chania that resembled an African wildcat, but had a bushy tail like a European wildcat. Groves considered the Cretan wildcat an introduced feral cat.  Distribution and habitat  The feral cat is the most widely distributed terrestrial carnivore. It occurs between 55° North and 54.3° South latitudes in a wide range of climatic zones and islands in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea, including Canary Islands, Port- Cros, Dassen Island, Marion Island, Juan de Nova Island, Réunion, Hahajima, Okinawa Island, Raoul Island, Herekopare Island, Stewart Island, Macquarie Island, Galápagos Islands, San Clemente Island, Isla Natividad, San José Island, and New Island. Feral cat colonies also occur on the Japanese islands of Ainoshima, Hahajima and Aoshima, Ehime. The feral cat population on the Hawaiian Islands is mainly of European origin and probably arrived in the 19th century on ships. Feral cat colonies in Rome have been monitored since 1991. Urban feral cats were studied in Madrid, Jerusalem and Ottawa. Behavior and ecology Some behaviors of feral cats are commonly observed, although there is disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when they are able to do so. If trapped, they hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out. They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly. Most feral cats have small home ranges, although some are more transient and travel long distances. The home ranges of male feral cats, which are generally two or three times larger than those of female cats, are on average under , but can vary from almost to under . This variance is often due to breeding season, access to females, whether the cat is neutered, age, time of day, and availability of prey. = Colonies = A colony of feral cats Feral cats often live in groups called colonies, which are located close to food sources and shelter. Researchers disagree on the existence, extent, and structure of dominance hierarchies among feral cats in colonies. Different types of hierarchies have been observed in colonies, including despotic and linear hierarchies. Some colonies are organized in more complex structures, such as relative hierarchies, where social status of individual cats varies, depending on location, time of day, or the activity the cats are engaged in, particularly feeding and mating. A 'managed colony' is taken care of by humans who supply food and water to the cats, provide shelters and veterinary care, implement trap-neuter-return programs, find foster homes for cats that can be socialized for eventual adoption, and educate people in the neighborhood. = Socialization = Feral kittens can be trapped and socialized, then adopted into a home. The age at which a kitten becomes difficult to socialize is not agreed upon, but suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age. Although older cats can sometimes be socialized, it is a very long and difficult process, and the cat rarely becomes friendly and may remain fearful. In a 2013 study with British participants, rescuers tended to be more willing than veterinarians to attempt to tame adult feral cats. Veterinarians tended to be more opposed to this practice, with some expressing concerns for the welfare of such a cat in a home environment. In a 2010 interview survey with veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for adult cats. = Diet = Feral cats can be effective hunters of small animals Feral cats are either mesopredators (mid-ranking predators) or apex predators (top predators) in local ecosystems. They prey on a wide variety of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and typically prefer smaller animals with body weights under , particularly mammals, birds, and lizards. Their global prey spectrum encompasses over 1,000 species; the most commonly observed were the house mouse, European rabbit, black rat, house sparrow, and common blackbird. In Australia, they prey on introduced species like the European rabbit and house mouse, and on native rodents and marsupials, particularly the common ringtail possum. Although some people advocate for feral cats as a means to control pigeons and invasive rodents like the house mouse and brown rat, these cosmopolitan species co-evolved with cats in human-disturbed environments, and so have an advantage over native rodents in evading cat predation. Studies in California showed that 67% of the mice killed by cats were native species, and that areas near feral cat colonies actually have larger house mouse populations, but fewer birds and native rodents. Though cats usually prey on animals less than half their size, a feral cat in Australia was photographed killing an adult pademelon of around the cat's weight at . Feral cats are prey of feral dogs, dingoes, coyotes, caracalshttp://www.urbancaracal.org/livingwithcaracals and birds of prey.  Health  =Life span and survival=  Without human assistance  Without human assistance, feral kittens are expected to have a high death rate, with approximately 50% dying within the first year. Of cats who survive kittenhood, the average life span of a feral cat without human care is less than two years. However, adult feral cats without human assistance have been found in surprisingly good condition. In Florida, a study of feral cats admitted to a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program concluded that \\"euthanasia for debilitated cats for humane reasons is rarely necessary\\". A further study of over 100,000 community cats (feral and stray) admitted to TNR programs in diverse locations of the U.S. resulted in the same 0.4% rate of euthanasia for debilitating conditions. The body condition of feral cats entering a TNR program in Florida was described as \\"generally lean but not emaciated\\". However, many community cats had suffered from parasites such as fleas and ear mites before entering TNR programs.  With human assistance  Feral cats in managed colonies can live long lives. A number of cats in managed colonies in the United Kingdom died of old age. A long-term study of a trap-neuter- return (TNR) program on a university campus in Central Florida found that, despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, 83% of the cats studied had been present for more than six years, with almost half first observed as adults of unknown age. The authors compared this result to a 1984 study that found the mean life span for domesticated cats was 7.1 years. = Disease = Types Feral cats, as with all cats, are susceptible to diseases and infections including rabies, bartonellosis, toxoplasmosis, feline panleukopenia virus, external and internal parasites, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), rickettsial diseases, ringworm, and feline respiratory disease complex (a group of respiratory illnesses including feline herpesvirus type 1, feline calicivirus, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasma haemofelis). Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus belong to the Retroviridae family, and both cause immunosuppression in cats, which can increase their susceptibility to other infections. Research has shown that the prevalence of these viruses among feral cat populations is low and is similar to prevalence rates for owned cats in the United States. Researchers studying 553 feral cats in North Florida in the United States tested them for a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be Bartonella henselae, the cause of cat-scratch disease in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. Feline coronavirus was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested did not appear to be a greater risk for shedding the virus than pet cats. Researchers studying 96 feral cats on Prince Edward Island in Canada found that feline roundworm was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by Toxoplasma gondii, which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding T. gondii oocysts. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one intestinal parasite, with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.  Transmission to humans  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has warned about the rabies risk associated with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s. In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States. Although some colony management programs involve administering rabies vaccines, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain. Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require post-exposure treatment. The study of feral cats on Prince Edward Island warned of \\"considerable zoonotic risk\\" for transmission of intestinal parasites. Although the authors noted that their study did not provide evidence for great risk associated with T. gondii in cats, they advised that the risk should still be considered, as the infection in humans can cause significant health problems, and cats who are not otherwise transmitting the infection can begin shedding the virus in times of stress. Control and management Feral cats are controlled or managed by various agencies to manage disease, for the protection of native wildlife and to protect their welfare. Control of feral cats can be managed through trapping and euthanasia or other forms of lethal control, or through trap-neuter-return (TNR). Trap-neuter-return involves trapping feral cats, vaccinating, spaying or neutering them, and then returning them to the place where there were originally trapped. In addition to the vaccinations and spay/neuter, cats may receive other medical care, such as dental care and parasite treatment. TNR programs are prevalent in several countries, including England, Italy, Canada, and the United States, and are supported by many local and state governments. Proponents of TNR argue that it is effective in stopping reproduction and reducing the population over time. TNR results in fewer complaints, as nuisance behaviors diminish following neutering, and the quality of life of the cats is improved. The practice is reported to save money and garner more public support and better morale than efforts that involve killing cats. The International Companion Animal Management Coalition advocates for TNR as a humane method of controlling feral cat populations. In the U.S., the practice is endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States and the National Animal Control Association. While the United States Department of Defense does not formally advocate TNR, it provides information to military installations on how to implement TNR programs, with the main message that population control programs must be humane. In 2011, an Australian study emphasised the need to monitor the effects of culling programs after infrared cameras found that the culling of feral cats led to an increase in feral cat populations in the culled areas. It was thought that only dominant cats were being baited and trapped during such operations. After the removal of dominant cats, there was an influx of subordinate animals to the area which unlike the dominant cats, did not venture into the traps. Within a year cat numbers in culled areas stabilised to original numbers. The effectiveness of both trap-and-euthanise and TNR programmes is largely dependent upon controlling immigration of cats into cleared or controlled areas; where immigration of new cats is controlled both techniques can be effective. However where immigration is not controlled culling is more effective. Comparisons of different techniques have also found that trap-and-euthanise programmes are half the cost of TNR ones. An analysis of both techniques in Hawaii suggested they are less effective when new cats were introduced by the abandonment of pets. The usefulness of TNR is disputed by some scientists and conservation specialists, who argue that TNR is primarily an animal welfare issue and ignores the ongoing damage done by neutered cats in the wild. Some conservation scientists question the effectiveness of TNR at controlling numbers of feral cats. Some studies that have supported TNR have also been criticised for using anecdotal data to evaluate their effectiveness. Effects on wildlife In the United States, free-ranging cats kill 1 to 4 billion birds and 6 to 22 billion mammals annually. In Australia, domestic cats were introduced in the 1800s to settlements that had developed near gold mining sites and farms as a pest control strategy to decimate rabbits, mice, and rats. Feral cats kill on average one million reptiles each day. It has been estimated that they kill more than 800 million mammals annually, of which 56% are native species. =Impact on prey species= A cat aiming for a pigeon To date, little scientific data is available to assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations outside of agricultural situations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline in the numbers of birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial. Feral cats can threaten native species with extinction. In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals. The ecological role of introduced cats may be more complicated. They control the rat population, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators. Native species such as the New Zealand kakapo and the Australian bettong tend to be more ecologically vulnerable and behaviorally \\"naive\\", when faced with predation by cats. Feral cats have had a major impact on these native species and have played a leading role in the endangerment and extinction of many species. In Hawaii's remote, mountainous areas, they destroy the nests of seabirds including Newell's shearwater (Puffinus newelli) and the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis). In agricultural settings, cats can be effective at keeping mouse and rat populations low, but only if rodent harborage locations (such as tall grass) are kept under control. While cats are effective at preventing rodent population explosions, they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations. Hybridisation with wildcats A Kellas cat, a landrace resulting from hybridisation between a domestic cat and a Scottish wildcat Feral cats have interbred with wildcats to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed. Modern genetic analysis revealed that the African wildcat is the ancestor of the domestic cat. Pure Scottish wildcats are unlikely to exist, but the current wildcat population is distinct enough from domestic cats to be worth protecting. High levels of hybridisation have led to difficulties in distinguishing pure wildcats from feral and domestic cats, which can complicate conservation efforts. Trap-neuter-return programs have been established to prevent hybridisation. Notable gene introgression into European wildcat populations exists also in Italy, Hungary, Spain and Portugal.

Career =Early life and Guidon Games= Wham worked a variety of odd jobs during his early adult life. After serving four years in the U.S. Navy, he worked for the Guidon Games hobby shop in Maine where he got his first game, a variant on a Civil War naval miniatures campaign, published. One of Wham's books was published in the same series of books from Guidon Games that began in 1971 with Chainmail. In 1972, Wham got a job with Don Lowry at Guidon Games, in the shipping/layout department of Campaign magazine; there, he co-authored a set of Civil War naval miniature rules, Ironclad. Afterwards he became a prison guard in his hometown, then held an office job in Denver. =TSR= In May 1977 he began working for TSR, Inc. at their Lake Geneva, Wisconsin headquarters as a general office worker, the company's 13th employee. After running the Dungeon Hobby Shop for a summer, he was moved upstairs to the company's art department. Wham worked with Dave Sutherland and Dave Trampier on the original Monster Manual. Wham began doing some creative work for the company, contributing a handful of illustrations for the original AD&D; Monster Manual, including the creature called the beholder. He also made a deal with Tim Kask, editor of The Dragon, to do a game in the centerfold, called Snit Smashing; this led to other games in Dragon, including The Awful Green Things from Outer Space. These games, printed on cardstock and included in the centerfold of the magazine, usually featured artwork supplied by Wham. Notable games published this way include: * Snit Smashing: Originally published in Dragon #10 (October 1977). In Wham's first game for Dragon, tiny creatures known as Snits run out from the sea and try to procreate while avoiding the giant blob-like Bolotomi, who smash the Snits out of boredom. Players alternate control between the Snits and the Bolotomus, attempting to make their own Snits reproduce faster than those of their opponent. * Snit's Revenge: Originally published in Dragon #11 (December 1977). In the more famous follow-up to Snit Smashing, the Snits set out to finally kill the elephantine Bolotomi who are smashing them, by invading their bodies and shutting down all their internal organs. This was published as a separate boardgame by TSR in 1978, and is now published by Steve Jackson Games. * The Awful Green Things from Outer Space: Originally published in Dragon #28 (August 1979). A game of green aliens invading a spaceship. This too was eventually published as a separate game by TSR and later published by Steve Jackson Games as well. * Search for the Emperor's Treasure: Originally published in Dragon #51 (July 1981). Players take the roles of adventurers searching a fantasy empire for the emperor's scattered magical treasures. A revised edition was included in a box set called \\"The Best of Dragon Games\\", 1990. * File 13: Originally published in Dragon #72 (April 1983). A game about designing board games. A second edition was reissued in \\"The Best of Dragon Games\\". * King of the Tabletop: Originally published in Dragon #77 (September 1983), this is a game in which people create their own kingdom from little cardboard chits representing land, characters, and events. Also expanded and published commercially as Kings and Things by West End Games, Games Workshop, and later, in a German edition, Pegasus Spiele. * Elefant Hunt: Originally published in Dragon #88 (August 1984). Great White Hunters travel through deepest, darkest \\"Aferca\\" with the help of natives to capture as much live animals and ivory as they can to sell for profit. =After TSR= After TSR, Wham collaborated on books with Rose Estes, and did his own novelette in Christopher Stasheff's The Exotic Enchanter. More games followed, including Kings & Things (with Rob Kuntz), the SimCity card game, and Iron Dragon. Later efforts include a reprint of Snits and Awful Green Things from Outer Space from Steve Jackson Games, and Planet Busters by Troll Lord Games. Wham designed the board game \\"King of the Tabletop\\" with Robert J. Kuntz, which was published in Dragon #77 (September 1983); the game was later expanded and rereleased as Kings & Things (1986) by West End Games, and was an Origins award-winner. Since leaving TSR, Wham has designed many more games, including collaborating with James M.

The mandibular central incisors are the first primary teeth to erupt, usually between 6 and 10 months of age. It can take several years for all 20 teeth to complete the tooth eruption. Though the process of teething is sometimes referred to as \\"cutting teeth\\", when teeth emerge through the gums they do not cut through the flesh. Instead, hormones are released within the body that cause some cells in the gums to die and separate, allowing the teeth to come through.\\"Teething\\". National Health Service of England Teething may cause a slightly elevated temperature, but not rising into the fever range of greater than . Higher temperatures during teething are due to some form of infection, such as a herpes virus, initial infection of which is extremely widespread among children of teething age. Signs and symptoms The level of pain that a baby can handle will be different for each child. Some may appear to suffer more than others while they are teething. The soreness and swelling of the gums before a tooth comes through is the cause for the pain and fussiness a baby experiences during this change. These symptoms usually begin about three to five days before the tooth shows, and they disappear as soon as the tooth breaks the skin.Teething Overview WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-01-25 Some babies are not even bothered by teething. Common symptoms include drooling or dribbling, increased chewing, mood changes, irritability or crankiness, and swollen gums. Crying, sleeplessness, restless sleep at night, and mild fever are also associated with teething. Teething can begin as early as 3 months and continue until a child's third birthday. When do Babies Start Teething? Kute Keiki. Retrieved on 2019-09-15 In rare cases, an area can be filled with fluid and appears over where a tooth is erupting and cause the gums to be even more sensitive. Pain is often associated more with large molars since they cannot penetrate through the gums as easily as the other teeth. Some noticeable symptoms that a baby has entered the teething stage include chewing on their fingers or toys to help relieve pressure on their gums. Babies might also refuse to eat or drink due to the pain. Symptoms will generally fade on their own, but a doctor should be notified if they worsen or are persistent. Teething may cause signs and symptoms in the mouth and gums, but does not cause problems elsewhere in the body. Infant and toddler health Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-01-25 Pulling on the ears is another sign of pain; the pain in the mouth throbs throughout the baby's head so they pull their ears believing that it will provide relief. Mild rash can develop around the mouth due to skin irritation that is caused by excessive drooling or dribbling. Teething Symptoms eMedicine Health Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-25 =Sequence of appearance= Stages of tooth emergence, at 0 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years. The infant teeth tend to emerge in pairs – first one lower incisor emerges then the other lower incisor emerges before the next set begin to emerge. The general pattern of emergence is: # Lower central incisors (2) at approximately 6 months # Upper central incisors (2) at approximately 8 months # Upper lateral incisors (2) at approximately 10 months # Lower lateral incisors (2) at approximately 10 months # First molars (4) at approximately 14 months # Canines (4) at approximately 18 months # Second molars (4) at approximately 2–3 years Milk teeth tend to emerge sooner in females than in males. The exact pattern and initial starting times of teething appear to be hereditary. When and how teeth appear in an infant has no bearing on the health of the child. =Misdiagnosis as teething= Teething has not been shown to cause fever or diarrhea; however, the belief that teething causes fever is extremely common among parents. Whilst there is some evidence that teething can cause an elevated temperature, it does not cause fever (medically defined as rectal temperature greater than . One small 1992 study found a significant rise in temperature on the day of eruption of the first tooth. Another study in 2000 found \\"mild temperature elevation\\" but not fever over . There is a risk that fever around the age of teething is dismissed as due to teething when it is actually due to illness, particularly infection by herpes viruses. \\"Coincidentally, primary tooth eruption begins at about the time that infants are losing maternal antibody protection against the herpes virus. Also, reports on teething difficulties have recorded symptoms which are remarkably consistent with primary oral herpetic infection such as fever, irritability, sleeplessness, and difficulty with eating.\\" \\"Younger infants with higher residual levels of antibodies would experience milder infections and these would be more likely to go unrecognized or be dismissed as teething difficulty.\\" Herpes virus infection may take the form of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (HSV-1) or of infection by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), which infects 90% of children by age 2. \\"The symptoms of elevated temperature and facial rash could be explainable by infection with the HHV-6 agent, which is ubiquitous among infants of teething age.\\", citing King DL Teething revisited. Pediatr Dent 1994; 16: 179–182. Other viruses may also cause fevers which may be misattributed to teething, but the oral involvement that may occur with herpes viruses makes misdiagnosis a particular risk for such infections. History of Teething and Relation to Fever Kute Keiki. Retrieved on 2019-07-04 Treatment Baby teething on a magazine, 1940 Infants may chew on objects to aid in the teething process. Teething necklaces or bracelets are not recommended as they can cause choking, strangulation, or irritation of the mouth. Teething rings and other toys, called teethers, are often designed with textures. Some infants gain relief from chewing on cold objects. Some people freeze small chunks of fresh fruits or vegetables and put them in teething nets. =Medication= In cases where the infant is in obvious pain, some doctors recommend the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or child-safe pain-relief treatments containing benzocaine, lidocaine, or choline salicylate. Benzocaine must be used cautiously because it can cause methemoglobinemia; choline salicylate is related to aspirin and \\"may cause Reye's syndrome in susceptible children, especially those with or recovering from viral infections, or when used in combination with other NSAIDs\\". 5% lidocaine gel produces anaesthesia (numbing) within 2–5 minutes, lasting for 10–20 minutes. However, one author concludes that, \\"Overall, the risks and adverse effects from inappropriate or prolonged use of pharmacological agents outweigh their potential benefits.\\" She points out that \\"the psychological trauma involved in administering medications or applying topical preparations to infants must be considered\\", and argues that \\"the placebo effect must not be overlooked. For example, applying a gel of 20% benzocaine in polyethylene glycol may give only a modest benefit over applying the placebo, which gives an efficacy of 60% compared with 90% for the active preparation.\\" Medicines are often applied to the babies' gums to relieve swelling and pain. These gels are similar to the toothache gel that is used by adults for sore gums and toothaches, but is administered in much smaller doses. Teething gels work as a numbing agent to dull the nerves in the gums so that the pain is less noticeable. It is important to follow the directions on the package to ensure that the correct amount of medication is administered and that proper techniques are used to reduce the risk for infection. It is important not to let the medicine numb the throat as it may interfere with the normal gag reflex and may make it possible for food to enter the lungs. Medications used to treat teething pain eMedicine MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-25 Similar medicines are also available in powder form, as \\"teething powder\\". Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are also recommended to treat the pain and swelling that babies experience. It should only be used a few times a day so that it does not mask symptoms that are being experienced due to other medical conditions and not because of teething. Products that contain aspirin should never be given to a child unless directed by a pediatrician, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Some traditional medicine used to treat teething pain has been found to be harmful due to high lead content, with effects including toxic encephalopathy. \\"Surma\\" or \\"kohl\\" has traditionally been used in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent as a teething powder, as have the Middle Eastern \\"saoott\\"/\\"cebagin\\". \\"Santrinj\\" - a 98% lead oxide product otherwise used as a paint primer - is also used in the Middle East as a home remedy for teething. History Early twentieth century teething ring and pacifier. Teething used to be considered (wrongly) a cause of death, as many children died in the first years of life, at the same time as teething occurs. \\"The tendency in the past to attribute serious disease to teething was so prevalent that in 1842 teething was the registered cause of death in 4.8% of all infants who died in London under the age of 1 year and 7.3% of those between the ages of 1 to 3 years according to the Registrar General's report.\\" Ironically, while teething is a natural process which creates little more than discomfort, some methods for relieving teething pain have caused serious harm and even death. Old remedies for teething include \\"blistering, bleeding, placing leeches on the gums, and applying cautery to the back of the head\\". In the sixteenth century the French surgeon Ambroise Paré introduced the lancing of gums using a lancet, in the belief that teeth were failing to emerge from the gums due to lack of a pathway, and that this failure was a cause of death. This belief and practice persisted for centuries, with some exceptions, until towards the end of the nineteenth century lancing became increasingly controversial and was then abandoned, although as late as 1938 an Anglo- American dental textbook advised in favour of lancing, and described the procedure. In the first half of the twentieth century, teething powders in the English-speaking world often contained calomel, a form of mercury. It was removed from most powders in 1954 when it was shown to cause \\"pink disease\\" (acrodynia), a form of mercury poisoning. Teething toys have a long history. In England in the 17th–19th centuries, a coral meant a teething toy made of coral, ivory, or bone, often mounted in silver as the handle of a rattle.OED; Examples from the Metropolitan A museum curator has suggested that these substances were used as \\"sympathetic magic\\" and that the animal bone could symbolize animal strength to help the child cope with pain.

The European Le Mans Series is similar to the former American Le Mans Series (ALMS) based in the United States and Canada that was running with ACO and IMSA between 1999 and 2013. ELMS team champions and runners-up receive an automatic entry to the following year's 24 Hours of Le Mans. Originally titled the Le Mans Endurance Series before becoming simply the Le Mans Series in 2006, the series was renamed once more in 2012, reusing a name previously utilized by IMSA in 2001. History When he was allowed to bring the rules and racing formulae of the 24 Hours of Le Mans to North America with the creation of the Petit Le Mans in 1998, Don Panoz attempted to build a series inspired by the Petit Le Mans. The aged IMSA GT Championship was taken over and became the new American Le Mans Series, and met with much success in 1999. Europe had lacked a major sports prototype series since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992. Following the success of the ALMS, Panoz attempting to bring sports prototype racing back to Europe. This led to the 2000 American Le Mans Series season, which included two races in Europe as the Nürburgring and Silverstone Circuit, as well as a round in Australia. These races would serve as a precursor to what would become the separate European Le Mans Series in 2001. The European Le Mans Series was launched for 2001 with five races, including a premier 1000 km race at Estoril, which would be the European equivalent of the 1000 mile Petit Le Mans and earn automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for each class winner. To aid in the development of the ELMS, the 2001 season shared some races between both ALMS and ELMS. The 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, normally ALMS races, were considered optional races for ELMS teams. At the same time, the ELMS races at Donington Park and Jarama were considered optional for ALMS teams. This allowed for the possibility of boosting the draw from international teams to either series. The series was unable to earn much attention from European sportscar teams, especially since the final FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship series used similar cars, but different rules which would require teams to modify their cars or buy new cars to comply with ELMS rules. For the ELMS events that included ALMS teams, very few teams actually bothered to make the trip across the Atlantic to participate in races that appeared to have very few serious competitors. Thus the entry lists for each race fell from 25 at the beginning of the season to a mere 14 at season's end, with some classes only having one or two competitors. With a lack of involvement from teams, and less interest from the media due to the lack of teams, the European Le Mans Series folded following the 2001 season. The ACO was not completely satisfied with the fact that IMSA did not fully comply with the ACO's regulations in order to help attract privateer teams, as well as the failure of the FIA Sportscar Championship to succeed in Europe. Seeing the success of the American Le Mans Series, the ACO decided that a series run by themselves would be a better alternative for Europe. The ACO would instead attempt to attract factory backed teams with longer endurance races than ALMS and FIA SCC ran. The series would also be European based instead of international, thus it could be closer to the factories of many sportscar teams to help attract them to the series. In 2003, the ACO announced their intentions to create their own European-based series, named the Le Mans Endurance Series, which would be similar to the original European Le Mans Series, but feature only 1000 km races instead of the shorter, 2 hour 45 minute races used by the ELMS, and fewer races in a season than the ALMS and FIA SCC to help keep costs down. Winners of the LMES championship would go on to earn automatic entries in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, similar to the American Le Mans Series. The series was initially previewed in an open race run under the LMES banner in 2003 at the 1000km of Le Mans, a one-off event before the season started in 2004. For the 2004 Le Mans Series, the series participated in four events, including resurrecting classic races like the 1000km Monza, 1000km Nürburgring, 1000 km Silverstone and the Spa 1000 km. Many competitors participated, making the racing very exciting. 2005 saw the series expand to a five race format with the addition of the Istanbul Racing Circuit. In 2007, the LMS held its first and single overseas race with Mil Milhas Brasil as the sixth round. In 2010, the Formula Le Mans Cup was integrated into the Le Mans Series, running alongside Le Mans Prototype cars and GT cars. As the FIA World Endurance Championship was reestablished in 2012, the ELMS had a reduced car count, and its calendar was reduced to three rounds in Paul Ricard, Donington Park and Road Atlanta (Petit Le Mans). For 2013 a twenty-nine car field was announced including eleven LMP2 cars and ten LM GTE class cars. The calendar featured five races with a duration of 3 hours. In 2014 the LMPC class was dropped and all races were expanded to 4 hours. The 2015 season saw the introduction of the new LMP3 class. In 2016 the GTC class featuring GT3-spec cars was dropped from the series. A new support series, the GT3 Le Mans Cup, was created and will race on the same weekends as the 4-hour events as well as on the same week as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2017 it was established by ACO that the lower teams from LMP3 would drop to following year Michelin Le Mans Cup, while the best LMP3 teams from this competition would be promoted to ELMS.

On November 29, 2010, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the constituency of Winnipeg North in a by-election. He was re-elected during the 2011 election by a margin of just 44 votes. Lamoureux had previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2010, and he twice sought the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party. He serves in the House of Commons as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Background Lamoureux was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Winnipeg. He worked as a store manager and air traffic control assistant, also serving in the armed forces for three years. His younger brother Darrin Lamoureux was the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party from 2013 to 2017. His daughter, Cindy Lamoureux, is an MLA for the Winnipeg riding of Burrows. Member of the Manitoba Legislature Lamoureux first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 election in the north end Winnipeg division of Logan. The Liberal Party did not have a strong provincial organization in this campaign, and Lamoureux finished a distant third against New Democrat Maureen Hemphill. The Manitoba Liberal Party saw its popularity increase between 1986 and 1988, as many centre-left voters abandoned the New Democratic Party (NDP) government of Howard Pawley. In the 1988 election, the Liberals jumped from one seat to twenty and became the dominant party in both north and south Winnipeg. Lamoureux scored a narrow victory over NDP incumbent Don Scott in the north end division of Inkster and entered the legislature as a member of the Official Opposition. The Liberal Party fell back to seven seats in the 1990 provincial election, finished third place behind a resurgent New Democratic Party. Lamoureux, however, was re- elected in Inkster with an increased margin of victory. ;Leadership campaigns Lamoureux ran for the Manitoba Liberal Party's leadership in 1993 after the resignation of Sharon Carstairs. He was seen as an \\"anti-establishment\\" candidate in this contest, representing north end Winnipeg communities against a party establishment dominated by south end Winnipeg interests. He lost to Paul Edwards. The Liberals were leading in the polls before the 1995 provincial election, but their support base collapsed during the campaign and the party won only three seats. Lamoureux again increased his majority in Inkster, while Edwards was defeated in St. James. Edwards announced his resignation in late 1995, and Lamoureux again stood for the party leadership. He was again regarded as an \\"anti-establishment\\" candidate, this time facing Ginny Hasselfield who was supported by the party's leadership. This contest was very divisive, and its ending was controversial. All party members were able to cast a ballot, and the results were \\"weighted\\" by constituency. It is generally acknowledged that Lamoureux received a greater number of total party membership votes than Hasselfield. Because his support was concentrated in north Winnipeg, however, Hasselfield won the weighted vote by 21 points. ;Defeat and return The divisions in the Manitoba Liberal Party continued after the leadership contest. Following the 1997 Canadian federal election, Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski announced that they could no longer support Hasselfield's leadership and would sit as \\"Independent Liberals\\". This decision left Neil Gaudry as the party's only official member of the legislature. Facing increased pressure, Hasselfield agreed to resign as party leader in early 1998. Jon Gerrard was elected as her successor, and Lamoureux and Kowalski rejoined the party caucus. The Liberal Party entered the 1999 provincial election in a weakened state, damaged by the divisions of the previous years. The election itself became polarized between the governing Progressive Conservatives and the opposition New Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party's support fell significantly. Although still personally popular, Lamoureux was narrowly defeated by New Democrat Becky Barrett. Lamoureux ran as a Liberal Party candidate in Winnipeg Centre in the 2000 Canadian federal election. He finished second to New Democratic Party (NDP) incumbent Pat Martin.Riding history for Winnipeg Centre (1997- ) from the Library of Parliament Becky Barrett did not seek re-election in 2003, and Lamoureux was again elected to the legislature for Inkster.2003 Inkster election results The only other Liberal to win election in this campaign was Jon Gerrard. Both Lamoureux and Gerrard were re-elected in the 2007 election, but the party did not make any further gains.2007 Inkster election results Member of the Canadian House of Commons Lamoureux resigned his provincial seat in 2010 to seek election to the House of Commons of CanadaLamoureux resigns as MLA, eyes federal run.

The Heimskringla relates that he was the son of Högne of Nærøy, and that he had his home in Jutland (however, according to the older source Historia Norwegiae, he was Geatish). He pillaged in the Baltic Sea and at night they made shore in the hundred of Lofond/Lovund (perhaps Lovön or the Lagunda Hundred) where they surrounded a house and set it on fire killing everybody inside. In the house there was a feast where the Swedish king Östen was invited. Then Sölve and his men arrived in Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and declared that the Swedes had to accept him as king. The Swedes refused and fought Sölve for eleven days until they lost. Sölve then ruled Sweden until the Swedes rebelled and killed him. Historia Norwegiae only relates that the Geats burnt Östen and his people to death inside his house. Sölvi also appears in Half's saga, of which there is a version from the year 1300. This saga relates that Sölvi was the son of Högne the rich of Nærøy fyrir Naumundalsminni in Norway and that he was the brother of Hild the Slender. Sölvi's brother-in-law, Hjorleiv, was the king of Hordaland and Rogaland and Hjorleiv killed Hreidar, the king of Zealand. Then Hjorleiv put Sölvi as the jarl of Zealand. Later in the saga, Sölvi is no longer the jarl of Zealand, but the king of Sweden. Hjorleiv had a son named Half (after whom the saga is named), and after the Norwegian king Asmund had killed Half, a couple of his champions go to Sweden and king Sölvi (til svíþjóðar ; fóru þeir ... á fund Sölva konungs) (see also Gard Agdi).

A clonal colony or genet is a group of genetically identical individuals, such as plants, fungi, or bacteria, that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively, not sexually, from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. In fungi, \\"individuals\\" typically refers to the visible fruiting bodies or mushrooms that develop from a common mycelium which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the soil. Clonal colonies are common in many plant species. Although many plants reproduce sexually through the production of seed, reproduction occurs by underground stolons or rhizomes in some plants. Above ground, these plants most often appear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected and are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to recognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also sexually reproducing. Methods of establishment With most woody plants, clonal colonies arise by wide-ranging roots that at intervals send up new shoots, termed suckers. Trees and shrubs with branches that may tend to bend and rest on the ground, or which possess the ability to form aerial roots can form colonies via layering, or aerial rooting, e. g. willow, blackberry, fig, and banyan. Some vines naturally form adventitious roots on their stems that take root in the soil when the stems contact the ground, e.g. ivy and trumpet vine. With other vines, rooting of the stem where nodes come into contact with soil may establish a clonal colony, e.g. Wisteria. Ferns and many herbaceous flowering plants often form clonal colonies via horizontal underground stems termed rhizomes, e.g. ostrich fern Matteuccia struthiopteris and goldenrod. A number of herbaceous flowering plants form clonal colonies via horizontal surface stems termed stolons, or runners; e.g. strawberry and many grasses. Non-woody plants with underground storage organs such as bulbs and corms can also form colonies, e.g. Narcissus and Crocus. A few plant species can form colonies via adventitious plantlets that form on leaves, e.g. Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Tolmiea menziesii. A few plant species can form colonies via asexual seeds, termed apomixis, e.g. dandelion. Record colonies The only known natural example of King's Lomatia (Lomatia tasmanica) found growing in the wild is a clonal colony in Tasmania estimated to be 43,600 years old. A group of 47,000 Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees (nicknamed \\"Pando\\") in the Wasatch Mountains, Utah, United States, has been shown to be a single clone connected by the root system. It is sometimes considered the world's largest organism by mass, covering , and also as among the world's oldest living organisms, at an estimated 80,000 years old. It is possible that other unknown clonal colonies of trees rival or exceed its size and/or age. Another possible candidate for oldest organism on earth is an underwater meadow of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea, which could be up to 100,000 years of age. Examples When woody plants form clonal colonies, they often remain connected through the root system, sharing roots, water and mineral nutrients. A few non-vining, woody plants that form clonal colonies are quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), bladdernut, blueberry (Vaccinium), devil's Club (Oplopanax horridus), forsythia, hazelnut (Corylus), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), kerria (Kerria japonica), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), poplars (Populus), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), sumac (Rhus), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and sweetshrub (Calycanthus floridus) .

In Nordic legends, according to Sögubrot and the Lay of Hyndla, he was the son of Ráðbarðr the king of Garðaríki and Auðr the Deep-Minded, the daughter of the Danish-Swedish ruler Ivar Vidfamne. In these two sources, Auðr had Randver's brother, Harald Wartooth, in a previous marriage.Nerman (1925), p. 243-6. One of the genealogies in Hversu Noregr Byggðist seems to say that he is the son of Hrœrekr slöngvanbaugi and the brother of Harald Wartooth.Hversu Noregr byggðist, Chapter V Hrœrekr was, according to Sögubrot, a Danish king on Zealand who was killed by Ivar Vidfamne.Nerman (1925), p. 244. According to Hervarar saga both Randver and Harald Wartooth were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild, the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. This saga relates that Ivar appointed Valdar as the king of Denmark, and when Valdar died, he was succeeded by Randver. Randver married Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder (in other sagas said to be the wife of Gudrød the Hunter of Vestfold), who gave birth to a son, Sigurd Hring. After his brother Harald had reclaimed Götaland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript), Randver fell in battle in England.Ellehøj (1965), p. 89. The Hervarar saga says that Randver was succeeded as Danish king by his son Sigurd Hring (probably as Harald's viceroy).Ellehøj (1965), p. 89. However, Sögubrot says that Harald Wartooth elevated Sigurd Hring as sub-king of Sweden and Västergötland.The Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) does not clearly mention Randver, but rather asserts that Hring was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald and an unnamed sister of Harald Wartooth.Saxo Grammaticus (1905), p. 459. The Danish scholar Gudmund Schütte drew a parallel between the pair Ráðbarðr - Randver in Langfeðgatal and the pair Rædhere - Rondhere that is mentioned in line 123 in the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith (7th century?). Schütte's argument was that lists of heroic figures found in Widsith were reflected in the ordering of names in some later medieval sagas and chronicles.Schütte (1926), p. 44.

Delany. It was nominated for the 1976 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was shortlisted for a retrospective James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1995. It was originally published under the shorter title Triton. Delany has said that Trouble on Triton was written partly in dialogue with Ursula K. Le Guin's anarchist science fiction novel The Dispossessed, whose subtitle was An Ambiguous Utopia.On Triton and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R. Delany It is also loosely linked to other books by him (particularly Neveryóna) in its references to \\"the modular calculus\\", a vaguely described future mathematics that would analyze analogies, fictional constructs, and possibly human personalities. The most recent US edition from Wesleyan University Press (1996) has a foreword by the postmodern novelist Kathy Acker, focusing on Trouble on Triton as Orphic fiction.  Plot introduction  As the subtitle implies, the novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of utopia. Utopia literally means \\"good place\\" or \\"no place\\". Delany takes the term heterotopia from the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault.Sean Grattan, \\"I am a Reasonably Happy Man: The Trouble with Trouble on Triton\\", Tor.com, Aug 2, 2010 (accessed Jan 31 2016) Literally, heterotopia means \\"other place\\" or \\"a place of differences\\". Foucault uses the term to designate spaces outside everyday fixed institutional and social spaces, for example trains, motels and cemeteries. In the novel's future solar system, Neptune's moon Triton supports one of several human societies independent from Earth, which has developed along radically libertarian lines in some ways: though a representative government exists, it has virtually no power to regulate private behavior, and citizens may choose to live in an area where no laws apply at all. Technology provides for a high degree of self- modification, so that one can change one's physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes.  Plot summary  The novel examines how Triton's freedoms and customs are perceived by the main characters, particularly Bron Helstrom, a young man who has previously worked on Mars as a male prostitute. The society of Mars is far harsher than that of Triton, and it has evidently influenced Bron's personality. He is self-absorbed, often lacks insight about himself and others, and has great difficulty with personal relationships. Though the civilization of Triton offers everything that he could reasonably want, he is unhappy with his life, out of harmony with those around him, and continually looking for others to blame whenever things go wrong. As the novel continues, political tensions between Triton and Earth lead to a destructive interplanetary war. This is mainly used as the backdrop for Bron's (ultimately disastrous) relationship with a brilliant young woman known as the Spike, but Delany speculates about how an interplanetary war might actually unfold. Reception Although dissatisfied with the novel's \\"abrupt\\" conclusion, Richard A. Lupoff praised Triton as \\"a thoroughly absorbing, highly rewarding reading experience. . . . a noble and fascinating experiment [that] speaks well for the author.\\"\\"Richard Lupoff's Book Week,\\" Algol 17, 1977, pp. 31-32  Technology  The novel offers a unique directional artificial gravitational field created by inducing relativistic motion of atomic particles, essentially extreme elliptical orbits.  Connections to other works  Trouble on Triton is not to be confused with the 1941 Henry Kuttner novel or the 1954 Alan E. Nourse novel Trouble on Titan. The title of the novel was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's 1952 opera, Trouble in Tahiti. Fred Pohl, the editor at Bantam, made Delany shorten the title to Triton to avoid confusion. Trouble on Triton contains the first two parts of the five-part series \\"Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus\\", which continues in several volumes of the Return to Nevèrÿon series. The novel as a whole is Part One, while Part Two is the novel's second appendix. Bron's home city of Bellona on Mars shares its name with the Bellona where Delany's other novel Dhalgren is set. Wesleyan paperback edition. Several plot elements in Trouble on Triton have similar corresponding elements in Delany's Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand. Trouble on Triton is set in the same universe as Delany's short story \\"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\\", included in his collection Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories. The complex game vlet, which Bron observes the play of, is inspired by the Joanna Russ short story \\"A Game of Vlet\\", found in her collection The Zanzibar Cat.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) from Astra 2E on Freesat channel 967 and Sky channel 957, and in select areas on Virgin Media channel 858. The latest edition of Look North is also available to watch on the BBC iPlayer. Broadcasts On weekdays, Look North broadcasts six three-minute opt-outs during BBC Breakfast at 27 and 57 minutes past each hour – as of June 2016, the bulletins are also shared with Look North's sister service in Yorkshire and the North Midlands, as part of a pilot scheme. A 15-minute lunchtime news airs at 1.30 pm, before the main half-hour edition at 6:30 pm. and a 15-minute bulletin shown at 10:25 pm, following the BBC News at Ten. Look North also airs three bulletins during the weekend: early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday and a late night bulletin on Sundays, following the BBC News at Ten. The times of these bulletins vary. Coverage area The programme's main coverage area is East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, the editorial areas covered by BBC Lincolnshire and BBC Radio Humberside. Some households in rural north-west Norfolk receive the Hull edition of Look North. History Look Norths Hull-based programme began in November 2002, presented by Helen Fospero (née Morton) and Peter Levy. The programme was presented from a tiny studio built in the existing BBC building in Chapel Street and directed from a technical gallery at Leeds. The programme's first editor was Roger Farrant. Before 11 November 2002, this region was part of a BBC North region, served by Look North from Leeds with short six-minute opt-outs for the area (introduced during 2001) during the main evening programme at 6:30 pm and the BBC Ten O' Clock News. The November 2002 changes saw the opt extended to become a full half-hour programme at 6:30 pm, with the 10:25 pm opt-out remaining unchanged. Daytime and weekend bulletins were carried from Leeds. In 2004, Look North, along with the radio station Radio Humberside and the Online/Interactive Project, moved to new studios and offices in Queen's Gardens. Within a short time of going live from the new studios, dedicated daytime and weekend bulletins for the region were introduced, replacing the previous arrangement of carrying such bulletins from Leeds.

She emigrated as a child with her parents to the United States and lived in the immigrant neighborhood of the Lower East Side of Manhattan.  Personal life  Yezierska was born in the 1880s in Maly Plock to Bernard and Pearl Yezierski. Her family emigrated to America around 1890, following in the footsteps of her eldest brother, who had arrived in the States six years prior. They took up housing in the Lower East Side, Manhattan. Her family assumed the surname, Mayer, while Anzia took Harriet (or Hattie) as her first name. She later reclaimed her original name, Anzia Yezierska, in her late twenties. Her father was a scholar of Torah and sacred texts. Anzia Yezierska's parents encouraged her brothers to pursue higher education but believed she and her sisters had to support the men. In 1910 she fell in love with Arnold Levitas but instead married his friend Jacob Gordon, a New York attorney. After 6 months, the marriage was annulled. Shortly after, she married Arnold Levitas in a religious ceremony to avoid legal complications. Arnold was the father of her only child, Louise, born May 29, 1912. Around 1914 Yezierska left Levitas and moved with her daughter to San Francisco. She worked as a social worker. Overwhelmed with the chores and responsibilities of raising her daughter, she gave up her maternal rights and transferred the girl to Levitas. In 1916, Yezierska and Levitas officially divorced. She then moved back to New York City. Around 1917, she engaged in a romantic relationship with philosopher John Dewey, a professor at Columbia University. Both Dewey and Yezierska wrote about one another, alluding to the relationship. After she had become independent, her sister encouraged her to pursue her interest in writing. She devoted the remainder of her life to it. Yezierska was the aunt of American film critic Cecelia Ager. Ager's daughter became known as journalist Shana Alexander. Anzia Yezierska died November 21, 1970, of a stroke in a nursing home in Ontario, California.  Writing career  Yezierska wrote about the struggles of Jewish and later Puerto Rican immigrants in New York's Lower East Side. In her fifty-year writing career, she explored the cost of acculturation and assimilation among immigrants. Her stories provide insight into the meaning of liberation for immigrants—particularly Jewish immigrant women. Many of her works of fiction can be labeled semi-autobiographical. In her writing, she drew from her life growing up as an immigrant in New York's Lower East Side. Her works feature elements of realism with attention to detail; she often has characters express themselves in Yiddish-English dialect. Her sentimentalism and highly idealized characters have prompted some critics to classify her works as romantic. Anzia Yezierska in 1922 Yezierska turned to writing around 1912. Turmoil in her personal life prompted her to write stories focused on problems faced by wives. In the beginning, she had difficulty finding a publisher for her work. But her persistence paid off in December 1915 when her story, \\"The Free Vacation House\\" was published in The Forum. She attracted more critical attention about a year later when another tale, \\"Where Lovers Dream\\" appeared in Metropolitan. Her literary endeavors received more recognition when her rags-to-riches story, \\"The Fat of the Land,\\" appeared in noted editor Edward J. O'Brien's collection, Best Short Stories of 1919. Yezierska's early fiction was eventually collected by publisher Houghton Mifflin and released as a book titled Hungry Hearts in 1920. Another collection of stories, Children of Loneliness, followed two years later. These stories focus on the children of immigrants and their pursuit of the American Dream. Some literary critics argue that Yezierska's strength as an author was best found in her novels. Her first novel, Salome of the Tenements (1923), was inspired by her friend Rose Pastor Stokes. Stokes gained fame as a young immigrant woman when she married a wealthy young man of a prominent Episcopalian New York family in 1904. Her most studied work is Bread Givers (1925). It explores the life of a young Jewish-American immigrant woman struggling to live from day to day while searching to find her place in American society. Bread Givers remains her best known novel. Arrogant Beggar chronicles the adventures of narrator Adele Lindner. She exposes the hypocrisy of the charitably run Hellman Home for Working Girls after fleeing from the poverty of the Lower East Side. In 1929–1930 Yezierska received a Zona Gale fellowship at the University of Wisconsin, which gave her a financial stipend. She wrote several stories and finished a novel while serving as a fellow. She published All I Could Never Be (1932) after returning to New York City. The end of the 1920s marked a decline of interest in Yezierska's work. During the Great Depression, she worked for the Federal Writers Project of the Works Progress Administration. During this time, she wrote the novel, All I Could Never Be. Published in 1932, this work was inspired by her own struggles. As portrayed in the book, she identified as an immigrant and never felt truly American, believing native-born people had an easier time. It was the last novel Yezierska published before falling into obscurity. Her fictionalized autobiography, Red Ribbon on a White Horse (1950), was published when she was nearly 70 years old. This revived interest in her work, as did the trend in the 1960s and 1970s to study literature by women. \\"The Open Cage\\" is one of Yezierska's bleakest stories, written during her later years of life. She began writing it in 1962 at the age of 81. It compares the life of an old woman to that of an ailing bird. Although she was nearly blind, Yezierska continued writing. She had stories, articles, and book reviews published until her death in California in 1970.  Yezierska and Hollywood  The success of Anzia Yezierska's early short stories led to a brief, but significant, relationship between the author and Hollywood. Movie producer Samuel Goldwyn bought the rights to Yezierska's collection Hungry Hearts. The silent film of the same title (1922) was shot on location at New York's Lower East Side with Helen Ferguson, E. Alyn Warren, and Bryant Washburn. In recent years, the film was restored through the efforts of the National Center for Jewish Film, the Samuel Goldwyn Company, and the British Film Institute; in 2006, a new score was composed to accompany it. The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival showed the restored print in July 2010. Yezierska's 1923 novel Salome of the Tenements was adapted and produced as a silent film of the same title (1925). Recognizing the popularity of Yezierska's stories, Goldwyn gave the author a $100,000 contract to write screenplays. In California, her success led her to be called by publicists, \\"the sweatshop Cinderella.\\" She was uncomfortable with being touted as an example of the American Dream. Frustrated by the shallowness of Hollywood and by her own alienation, Yezierska returned to New York in the mid-1920s. She continued publishing novels and stories about immigrant women struggling to establish their identities in America.

Krákumál According to Krákumál (stanza 7), he fell at Ulleråker south of Uppsala. {  :Hjoggum vér með hjörvi. :Hátt grenjuðu rottar, :áðr á Ullarakri :Eysteinn konungr felli; :gengum golli fáðir :grundar vals af bröndum, :rækyndill smó rauðar :rítr, at hjalma móti; :svíra virtr ór sárum :sveif of hjarna kleifar.  } Ragnarssona þáttr The apparently oldest version, Ragnarssona þáttr, relates that Ragnar Lodbrok's sons had left Sweden and conquered Zealand, Reidgotaland (here Jutland), Gotland, Öland and all the minor islands. Ivar the Boneless, the leader, then settled at Lejre with his brothers. Ragnar was jealous with his sons' successes, and set Eysteinn as the jarl of Sweden, telling him to protect Sweden from his sons. He then went east across the Baltic Sea to pillage and to show his own skills. Ragnar's sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake Mälaren and sent a message to king Eysteinn that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar's sons, and Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn's daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner. Eysteinn offered Eric as much of Uppsala öd as he wanted, and Borghild, in wergild for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted. In Zealand, his mother Aslaug and his brothers Björn Ironside and Hvitserk, who had been playing tafl, become upset and sail to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug, calling herself Randalin rides with cavalry across the land. The battle ended with Eysteinn's death. When Ragnar died, Björn Ironside became the king of Sweden. Ragnar Lodbrok's saga Ragnar Lodbrok's saga tells that Eysteinn was the king of Sweden and a good friend of Ragnar Lodbrok. Eysteinn had the most beautiful daughter named Ingeborg. He was also a devout pagan and there were so many blóts at Uppsala that no other place had ever been its equal. The Swedes worshiped a holy cow named Sibilja, and when the Swedes were attacked by enemies they had the cow walk in front of the battle formation. The cow's magic was so great that when she began to bellow the enemies began to fight between themselves. When Ragnar Lodbrok was visiting Eysteinn at Uppsala, Eysteinn suggested that Ragnar marry Ingeborg and have her as wife instead of the pauper Aslaug (Kraka). Ragnar consequently betrothed himself to Ingeborg. Eventually, Aslaug found out from three small birds, and told Ragnar that she was no pauper. She was the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild. As Ragnar understood that Kraka was of better descent that Ingeborg, he decided not to go back to Sweden and wed Eysteinn's daughter. Eysteinn was upset with Ragnar's change of plans and declared that their friendship was no more. This was interesting news to Ragnar's sons Eric and Agnar who decided to go to Sweden and pillage, as their father would not mind anymore. Eysteinn sent the fiery cross in all directions and assembled the Swedish leidang. They also made Sibilja join the army, but they had to blót considerably to make her obey. When they had arrived at the location where Eric and Agnar were camped, Eysteinn ordered one third of the Swedish army to attack Eric and Ragnar's men, while the others would attack from all directions after the battle had begun. This was done and Sibilja began to bellow. Eric and Agnar's warriors began to fight between themselves and eventually Agnar died and Eric was taken captive. Eric was offered both peace and Ingeborg but Eric wanted the Swedes to stick spears into the ground and throw him on top of them so that he would die. When Aslaug heard the news of Eric and Agnar's death, she cried blood, and asked Ragnar's sons to avenge their dead brothers. Ivar the Boneless was afraid of the magic that ruled in Sweden, but when his little brother, the only three year old Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye wanted to attack Eysteinn, the brothers changed their minds. Sigurd's foster-father assembled five longships for him. Hvitserk and Björn Ironside mustered fourteen, while Aslaug and Ivar the Boneless marshalled ten ships each. Ivar would not allow his mother Aslaug to go by sea, but she could join the army of riders that would go across land. She accepted and changed her name to Randalin. When the armies met in battle, Ivar told everyone to make such a din that the bellowing from Sibilja could not be heard. This was of no use, however, and so Ivar shot two arrows in each of Sibilja's eyes. However, the cow could not be stopped. Then Ivar asked his men to throw him on top of the cow. Ivar made himself so heavy as he landed on the cow, that she was crushed. The Swedish leidang was beaten and Eysteinn fell. Ragnar's sons commanded that their brother had been avenged and that the Swedes should be spared pillaging. Hervarar saga The Hervarar saga tells that Eysteinn Beli was the son of Harald Wartooth. Hervarar saga made Harald Wartooth the king of Sweden and Sigurd Hring the king of Denmark, while other sources have it the other way round. It tells that Eysteinn inherited Sweden from his father Harald Wartooth and ruled it until he was killed by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, as told in Ragnar Lodbrok's saga. When Ragnar died, Björn Ironside became the king of Sweden. Gesta Danorum The Gesta Danorum (book 9) by Saxo Grammaticus also mentions Eysteinn, but only in passing. It says that Ragnar Lodbrok's son Agnar learnt that his brother Eric had been slain by Osten, the king of Sweden. He wished to avenge his brother but died in the battle. Skáldatal Skáldatal says that Eysteinn Beli was the patron of many skalds, including Bragi inn gamli, Grundi prúði, Erpr lútandi, Kálfr þrænzki, Refr ryzki, Ormr oframi, two named Ölvaldi, Ávaldi, Fleinn skáld and Rögnvaldr skáld.

It is part of the sestiere of Dorsoduro and is a locality of the comune of Venice. Geography Giudecca lies immediately south of the central islands of Venice, from which it is separated by the Giudecca Canal. San Giorgio Maggiore lies off its eastern tip. History Giudecca was known in ancient times as the Spinalunga (meaning \\"Long Thorn\\"). The name Giudecca may represent a corruption of the Latin \\"Judaica\\" (\\"Judaean\\") and so may be translated as \\"the Jewry\\": a number of towns in Southern Italy and Sicily have Jewish quarters named Giudecca or Judeca. However, the original Venetian Ghetto was in Cannaregio, in the north of the city, and there is no evidence, but for the name, of Jews ever having lived in Giudecca. Furthermore, the term \\"Giudecca\\" was not used to denote the Jewish quarters of towns in northern Italy. Giudecca was historically an area of large palaces with gardens, the island became an industrial area in the early 20th century with shipyards and factories, in addition to a film studio. Much of the industry went into decline after World War II, but it is now once more regarded as a quiet residential area of largely working-class housing with some chic apartments and exclusive houses. It is known for its long dock and its churches, including the Palladio-designed Il Redentore. The island was the home of a huge flour mill, the Molino Stucky, which has been converted into a luxury hotel and apartment complex. At the other end of Giudecca is the famous five- star Cipriani hotel with large private gardens and salt-water pool. =Resort town= Modern renovations of some antique architecture in Giudecca have bolstered the island's reputation as a vacation locale. In 2011, Venetian developers reopened the lodgings of a prominent 16th-century mansion as long- term rentals under the name \\"Villa F.\\" Gallery Church of the Redentore (7251821740).jpgIl Redentore church Festa del Redentore 2009 1.jpegThe pier that connects Giudecca with Venice during the Festa del Redentore in July Le Zitelle (7257700906).jpgLe Zitelle church Le quartier Junghans (Giudecca, Venise) (6157086872).jpgThe modern Junghans quarter Teatro junghans giudecca.JPGJunghans contemporary theater, seat of the Venetian Theatrical Academy Aerial view Venice l 07 2017 4999.jpgAerial view of the Giudecca Canal (left) See also * List of islands of Italy References  External links  * Satellite image from Google Maps * Guide, news, events in Giudecca * Mini Guide to Giudecca Category:Islands of the Venetian Lagoon Category:Dorsoduro Category:Geography of Venice Category:Historic Jewish communities ","title":"Giudecca"},{"id":"895755","text":"Skogskyrkogården (; ) is a cemetery located in the Gamla Enskede district south of central Stockholm, Sweden. Its design, by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, reflects the development of architecture from Nordic Classicism to mature functionalism. History Resurrection Statue at the Holy Cross Gravestone of Greta Garbo Uppståndelsekapellet (the Resurrection Chapel), designed by Sigurd Lewerentz Skogskapellet cemetery chapel, designed by Gunnar Asplund Skogskyrkogården came about following an international competition in 1915 for the design of a new cemetery in Enskede in the southern part of Stockholm, Sweden. The entry called \\"Tallum\\" by the young architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz was selected. After changes made to the design on the recommendations of the competition jury, work began in 1917 on land that had been old gravel quarries that were overgrown with pine trees, and the first phase was completed three years later. The architects' use of the natural landscape created an extraordinary environment of tranquil beauty that had a profound influence on cemetery design throughout the world. Essential models for the design of the cemetery were the German forest cemeteries of Friedhof Ohlsdorf at Hamburg and Waldfriedhof in Munich but also the neoclassical paintings of Caspar David Friedrich. The basis for the route through the cemetery is a long route leading from the ornamental colonnaded entrance that then splits, one way leading through a pastoral landscape, complete with a large pond and a tree-lined meditation hill, and the other up to a large detached granite cross and the abstract portico of the crematorium and the chapels of the Holy Cross, Faith, and Hope. The paths then rejoin and pass along a dead-straight path through a dense grove of tall pine trees, the so-called Way of Seven Wells, leading to the \\"Uppståndelsekapellet\\" or Resurrection Chapel. The giant dark granite cross at the focus of the vista from the main entrance has also been described as having been based on a painting by Caspar David Friedrich, titled \\"Cross on the Baltic Sea\\" (1815), signifying hope in an abandoned world; yet Asplund and Lewerentz insisted that the cross was open to non-Christian interpretations, even quoting Friedrich: \\"To those who see it as such, a consolation, to those who do not, simply a cross.\\"Ken Worpole, Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West, Reaktion Books, 2004, p. 147. The architects designed the entire complex, from the landscape to the smallest lamp, though there are also integrated sculptures by Carl Milles. Lewerentz's contribution mainly concerned the landscape but also the main entrance and the classical \\"Uppståndelsekapellet\\" or Resurrection Chapel, which was built in 1925. Asplund devoted himself mainly to the buildings, and the small Woodland Crematorium — built in 1935–40 — has been regarded as a central work in his oeuvre as well as the Nordic Classicism style of that period. The small chapel, set on a Tuscan peristyle and featuring a gold statue on the roof by Carl Milles, was in fact derived from a \\"primitive hut\\" that Asplund had happened to see in a garden at Liselund.Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture - A Critical History. London, Thames & Hudson, 1980. The crematorium, with its Faith, Hope, and Holy Cross Chapels, was Asplund's final work of architecture, designed in a rational modernist style typical for his later work, opened shortly before his death in 1940. In 1994, Skogskyrkogården was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and although it does not have the number of famous interments as the Norra begravningsplatsen, its much older counterpart in northern Stockholm, it is a major tourist attraction. At the Tallum Pavilion (a building designed originally by Asplund as staff facilities), visitors can see an exhibition about the cemetery and the story of its origins and the two architects whose vision created it.

A former Manitoba teacher and principal, she was also president and co-founder of Cross Cultural Communications International Inc. a company that provided diversity training and education throughout Canada. In 1995, she was awarded the Manitoba YM/YWCA Woman of Distinction award. Although Hasselfield had never run for provincial office, she was known in Manitoba as a prominent organizer for the Liberal Party and was supported by the party's establishment against Kevin Lamoureux, a maverick MLA from north-end Winnipeg. Hasselfield and Lamoureux had a very poor personal relationship during the 1996 leadership contest. The voting was determined by a \\"weighted\\" balloting process (i.e. every party member could vote in his/her home constituency, and the votes from each constituency were averaged out to provide an equal number of \\"points\\" for the total). Lamoureux received more membership votes, but the concentration of his support in north Winnipeg meant that Hasselfield was able to attain a 21-point victory. After the federal election of 1997, Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski left the Liberal caucus to sit as \\"Independent Liberals\\" (this left Neil Gaudry as the only official Liberal MLA in the Manitoba legislature). With the party's internal organization crumbing, Hasselfield was persuaded to stand down as party leader on February 4, 1998. While she never stood for election to the legislature, she was leader during one by-election in Portage la Prairie. Hasselfield later moved to British Columbia, and continued her active involvement in the Liberal Party of Canada. Her roles included chairing the Federal Liberal President's Council of British Columbia and co-chair of the Liberal Laurier Club. In 2006, she was appointed a Director of the Fraser River Port Authority and was involved in developing plans that eventually amalgamated the Port of Vancouver with the North and South Fraser ports. She is currently on the Board of the South Coast British Columbia Transit Police Authority.

Keller once again excelled and was awarded the tournament's Silver Ball as the tournament's second best player. =Millwall= After being a member of the U.S. National Team in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, he was signed by the English club Millwall, playing there and becoming a fan favorite between 1992 and 1996. Keller made his Millwall debut on May 2, 1992 and played his last game on May 5, 1996, making 202 overall appearances for The Lions. Keller was voted Player of The Year 1992–93 by the Lions fans and also picked up the Junior Lions and Disabled Millwall Fans' awards. When Millwall were relegated to the Second Division, the team transferred Keller to Leicester City for £900,000 on August 15, 1996. =Leicester City= In his first year with Leicester City, Keller played a vital part in the team's success in both a strong league position and winning the 1997 League Cup. The team reached the final again in 1999; a last minute goal lost them the match. That summer, he left the club for Spain on a free transfer. =Rayo Vallecano= Keller signed with the newly promoted Spanish club Rayo Vallecano for the 1999–2000 season and played there for two years. =Tottenham Hotspur= In August 2001, Keller returned to England and the Premier League, joining Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer. Relegated to backup duty for Neil Sullivan early on, he won the starting spot, and played every minute for Spurs in both the 2002–03 and the 2003–04 seasons. In the 2004–05 Premiership season, Keller fell out of favor at Tottenham, as Paul Robinson became the first choice keeper. In November 2004, Kasey was loaned out to Southampton, a Premiership club ravaged by injuries to its goalkeepers, for one month. =Borussia Mönchengladbach= On January 15, 2005, Keller joined German Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach on a free transfer during the Bundesliga's winter break. He got off to a good start in the Bundesliga, keeping a clean sheet in his first appearance for Borussia. Keller played every minute in the second half of the season and kept a total of seven clean sheets in that period, playing an important role in saving the club from relegation. Keller also lived in Haus Donk, a castle in Tönisvorst, near Mönchengladbach. During the 2006–07 season he was one of the two Bundesliga players to be hobby-columnists for RUND, a German soccer magazine published once each month, reflecting his life in Germany and his Bundesliga career within those lines. He shared that role with VfB Stuttgart's shot-stopper Timo Hildebrand. On August 10, 2006 Keller was selected by his teammates to captain club side Borussia Mönchengladbach during the 2006–07 campaign. He is the second American (after Claudio Reyna) to captain a top level German club. =Fulham= In August 2007, Keller returned to the Premier League, signing for Fulham. The length of Keller's contract and financial details were not disclosed by the club. He was bought as a back-up to goalkeeper Antti Niemi, but nagging injuries to Niemi saw him take over as principal goalkeeper at Fulham. However, the day before the Premier League match against Derby County in October, Keller injured his arm in training and was on the sidelines until late January. He returned as a substitute keeper in the 2–1 win over Aston Villa on February 3. From then on he was only second choice until Fulham's match against Blackburn where he started the game, with Niemi on the bench. He then went on to start Fulham's remaining games as they defied all odds and avoided relegation on the last day of the season with a 1–0 win over Portsmouth at Fratton Park. =Seattle Sounders FC= Keller saves a penalty kick taken by Thierry Henry of the New York Red Bulls in 2011. On August 14, 2008, Keller returned to the United States to sign with 2009 MLS expansion team Seattle Sounders FC. He was the starting goalkeeper for the MLS team's first-ever match, on March 19, 2009, which the Sounders won 3–0. He continued to have a clean sheet in each of his next three starts, with a score of 2–0 per start. He also set the record for most minutes without a goal to start a season in MLS history. His clean sheet streak came to an end on May 2, 2009 at 457 minutes in the second half of a game against the Chicago Fire. Keller played his final regular season home game for the Sounders on October 15, 2011, a game in which the Sounders beat the San Jose Earthquakes 2–1 with goals from Sammy Ochoa and Fredy Montero to send Keller out in style. A record crowd of 64,140 people were present. International career Keller got his first senior team cap against Colombia on February 4, 1990 and was on the roster as Tony Meola's back up at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. After being ignored by U.S. coach Bora Milutinović for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he made Steve Sampson's ill-fated squad in 1998, and played two games at the World Cup. Keller was an overage selection for the 1996 Olympics team, starting all three matches. Kasey was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 1997 and 1999, and again in 2005. Perhaps his most famous clean sheet came in the historic 1998 win versus Brazil. Keller played all 90 minutes in goal and made ten saves, many from point blank range, in preserving the 1–0 shutout victory for the U.S. His performance in goal prompted Brazilian great Romário to remark \\"That is the best performance by a goalkeeper I have ever seen,\\" the performance was commemorated in the song \\"Kasey Keller\\" by synth-pop band Barcelona. For most of their careers, Keller and Brad Friedel were engaged in a head to head battle for the U.S. goalkeeper's jersey. Keller got the nod in 1998 but was second choice to Friedel in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In spite of this stiff competition he has the second most caps and wins of any men's goalkeeper in U.S. soccer history with 102 and 53 respectively, behind current star Tim Howard. Keller remains the team's all-time leader in keeping clean sheets with 47. Keller crowned the U.S.'s run in the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament with a clean sheet in the final match against Panama and two saves in the penalty shootout to give the side the trophy. Keller started the first seven games of the final round of World Cup qualifying in 2005, recording five consecutive clean sheets and 507 consecutive goalless minutes to lead the U.S. to qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Finals in Germany. He then became the first male player in U.S. history to win his third Athlete of the Year award. On May 2, 2006 Keller and teammate Claudio Reyna became the first two Americans named to four World Cup Rosters. In that World Cup, he played in all three games, being named Man of the Match in the 1–1 draw with Italy in Kaiserslautern on June 17, 2006. Keller is the only U.S. player to participate in both the 1990 and 2006 World Cups. Personal life Keller resides in Seattle with his wife Kristin and their two children, Cameron and Chloe, twins born on August 26, 1997. Keller has lived in London, Madrid, and Germany, where he and his family lived in a 1,000-year-old castle. During his time abroad, Keller has learned to speak German and Spanish fluently. He told the New York Times that he turned down offers from several European clubs to sign with Seattle for the sake of his children, who have attended a new school with every transfer he has made. Keller has been featured on ESPN as a soccer analyst.

It is the source of the famous quotations \\"To err is human, to forgive divine\\", \\"A little learning is a dang'rous thing\\" (frequently misquoted as \\"A little knowledge is a dang'rous thing\\"), and \\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread\\".  Composition  The first fragmentary drafts of the work were written in Abberley in 1707.Mack 1985, p. 168. It was first published in May 1711.Mack 1985, p. 177. Many of the poem's ideas had existed in prose form since at least 1706. Composed in heroic couplets (pairs of adjacent rhyming lines of iambic pentameter) and written in the Horatian mode of satire, it is a verse essay primarily concerned with how writers and critics behave in the new literary commerce of Pope's contemporary age. The poem covers a range of good criticism and advice, and represents many of the chief literary ideals of Pope's age. Structure and themes The verse \\"essay\\" was not an uncommon form in eighteenth-century poetry, deriving ultimately from classical forebears including Horace's Ars Poetica and Lucretius' De rerum natura.Sitter 2011, p. 34. Pope contends in the poem's opening couplets that bad criticism does greater harm than bad writing: Despite the harmful effects of bad criticism, literature requires worthy criticism. Pope delineates common faults of poets, e.g., settling for easy and clichéd rhymes: Throughout the poem, Pope refers to ancient writers such as Virgil, Homer, Aristotle, Horace and Longinus. This is a testament to his belief that the \\"Imitation of the ancients\\" is the ultimate standard for taste. Pope also says, \\"True Ease in Writing comes from Art, not Chance,/ As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance\\" (362–363),Pope 1963, p. 155 meaning poets are made, not born. As is usual in Pope's poems, the Essay concludes with a reference to Pope himself. William Walsh, the last of the critics mentioned, was a mentor and friend of Pope who had died in 1708.  Critical reception  An Essay on Criticism was famously and fiercely attacked by John Dennis, who is mentioned mockingly in the work. Consequently, Dennis also appears in Pope's later satire, The Dunciad. Thomas Rymer, and Jonathan Swift were among other critics: Rymer, who had the strongest critique said, \\"till of late years England was as free from critics as it is from wolves...they who are least acquainted with the game are aptest to bark at everything that comes in their way.\\"; Swift's statement concentrated on critics who were damned \\"as barbarous as a judge who should take up a resolution to hang all men that came before him upon trial.\\" Part II of An Essay on Criticism includes a famous couplet: This is in reference to the spring in the Pierian Mountains in Macedonia, sacred to the Muses. The first line of this couplet is often misquoted as \\"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing\\". The Essay also gives this famous line (towards the end of Part II): The phrase \\"fools rush in where angels fear to tread\\" from Part III (line 625Pope 1963, p. 163) has become part of the popular lexicon, and has been used for and in various works.

He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals. Wilson played minor league baseball for three teams until the end of 1907, when he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. After spending six seasons with the organization, Wilson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, where he spent the last three seasons of his major league career and with whom he played his last game on October 1, 1916. Wilson is best known for setting the single-season record for triples in with 36, a record that still stands. Personal life Wilson was born on August 21, 1883, in Austin, Texas. He grew up at a ranch owned by his family located approximately 50 miles north of Austin in Bertram. He was known for his introverted nature; his Pirates teammate and roommate Bobby Byrne recounted how Wilson \\"wouldn't say two words all day.\\" Wilson started his baseball career playing on several teams in independent leagues, before joining the Austin Senators in 1905. After he retired from baseball, Wilson returned to his family ranch in Bertram, where he became a stock farmer and held various positions in service to the community. He died on October 24, 1954, at the age of 70 and was interred at Austin Memorial Park. On March 31, 2007, the Bertram Little League Sports Complex was dedicated to and named after Wilson. =Origins of nickname= Contrary to popular belief, Wilson was not of Native American descent. He was nicknamed \\"Chief\\" because his Pittsburgh teammates and manager Fred Clarke thought Wilson, a native Texan with a towering height of , resembled a \\"Chief of the Texas Rangers.\\" Professional career =Minor leagues= In , Wilson signed with the Austin Senators, a minor league baseball team in the Texas League. However, the team disbanded in the middle of the season on June 6 and Wilson joined the Fort Worth Panthers, playing for them until he was promoted to the Des Moines Champs of the Western League in . He performed well, posting a batting average of .323 in 56 games. It was during his first (and only) season with the Champs that Wilson was spotted by Denver Grizzlies' pitcher Babe Adams, who had signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of 1907. Adams informed Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss of Wilson's \\"tremendous arm\\" and his ability \\"not only as a hitter but as a fielder.\\" This prompted Dreyfuss to sign Wilson to the Pirates as their right fielder. Wilson made his major league debut for the Pirates on April 15, 1908, at the age of 24, in a 3–1 Opening Day win against the St. Louis Cardinals. =Pittsburgh Pirates (1908–1913)= A T207 baseball card depicting Wilson. During his rookie season, Wilson had a relatively disappointing year, batting .227, slugging .285 and finished sixth in the National League (NL) in strikeouts with 66. Out of his 120 hits that season, only 18 were extra base hits. As a result of his offensive woes, Pirates fans booed him on a constant basis. Wilson greatly improved his batting in the following season, raising his batting average to .272, playing all 154 games in the season and finishing fifth in the NL in triples with 12. This success culminated in the Pirates winning the World Series at the conclusion of that season. In the Opening Day game of the season, Wilson got injured and had to sit out for seven games, with Vin Campbell taking his place in the lineup. On July 3, against the Cincinnati Reds, he hit for the cycle. He finished the season with similar statistics as the previous year, batting .276 and hitting 13 triples. The season was a breakout year for Wilson. He posted a batting average of .300, finished third in the NL in doubles (34), fifth in home runs (12) and sixth in slugging (.472) and drove in 107 runs batted in (RBI), thus becoming the league's RBI champion. The 12 home runs he hit that season marked a Pirates team record he held until . In , Wilson recorded the same batting average as the year before and came second in the league in slugging (.513) and games played (152), third in home runs (11), fourth in RBI (95) and seventh in hits (175). Furthermore, he set the single-season record for triples, hitting 36 in total that year. However, his record received almost no press coverage whatsoever. Baseball sportswriter Ernest Lanigan suggested that this was because a record book erroneously attributed Nap Lajoie with having 44 triples in , when he hit only 11 that year. As a result, several newspapers—most notably the Pittsburgh Press—were under the belief that Lajoie held the record. Wilson's record still stands today and is currently the third oldest single-season record, behind Lajoie's .426 batting average in 1901 and Jack Chesbro's 41 wins in 1904. It is considered one of baseball's most unbreakable records, ' as only Sam Crawford (1914) and Kiki Cuyler (1925) have come the closest to breaking the record; both players hit 26 triples. Wilson's record also accounted for part of the 129 triples amassed by the Pirates that year, setting a single-season for most triples by a team since 1900. Due to his stellar and record-breaking performance, Wilson finished eighth in that season's voting for the Chalmers Award, the precursor to the MLB Most Valuable Player Award. =St. Louis Cardinals (1914–1916)= Wilson finished his career playing 3 seasons for the Cardinals.

The means by which this crime could be perpetrated can include attempting to discredit potential jurors to ensure they will not be selected for duty. Once selected, jurors could be bribed or intimidated to act in a certain manner on duty. It could also involve making unauthorized contact with them for the purpose of introducing prohibited outside information and then arguing for a mistrial. In the United States, people have also been charged with jury tampering for handing out pamphlets and flyers indicating that jurors have certain rights and obligations, including an obligation to vote their conscience notwithstanding the instructions they are given by the judge. Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, the Special Criminal Court is a three- judge, juryless court which tries cases based on a majority vote. Use of the Special Criminal Court is restricted to cases where \\"ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice\\", and is allowed for by the Constitution of Ireland. While the power was initially created to prevent court cases being subverted by juries sympathetic to the defendant, the Special Criminal Court was established in 1972 to handle paramilitary cases resulting from the Troubles, when the risk of jury intimidation was high and there had also been a series of light sentences and acquittals by judges and juries sympathetic to the defendants. It has since been used to try cases of high-profile gang leaders and other high-risk non-terrorism cases where normal juries risk intimidation or revenge. United Kingdom In Great Britain, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows for non-jury trials when there is danger of jury tampering, or where jury tampering has taken place. On 18 June 2009, the Court of Appeal in England and Wales made a landmark ruling that resulted in the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, allowing the first-ever criminal trial to be held without a jury by invoking Section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The case in question involved four men accused of an armed robbery at Heathrow Airport in February 2004. After three juries either failed to reach verdicts or were discharged, the fourth trial of the case took place before a single judge, and ended on 31 March 2010 with guilty verdicts for all four accused.BBC News: Gang of four convicted of £1.75m armed Heathrow raid, 31 March 2010 The UK had previously established non-jury courts in Northern Ireland, known as Diplock Courts.

He accused one of his teachers, Blanche Bettington, of being \\"communistic\\" because she warned her students against \\"reactionary\\" publications. Bettington and another teacher were removed from teaching as a result, but were reinstated by the Los Angeles Board of Education in 1946, commenting, \\"While this inquiry has raised serious questions as to certain classroom practices engaged in by these teachers, it has also produced evidence of many outstanding accomplishments by them\\". Nofziger served in the United States Army and then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from San Jose State College in San Jose, California, and later worked for sixteen years as a reporter, editor and Washington, DC, correspondent for Copley Newspapers and Copley News Service. In 1966, Nofziger was named press secretary for Ronald Reagan's successful California gubernatorial campaign and served two years as Reagan's Director of Communications. Nixon years Nofziger with Lee Atwater in 1982 President Ronald Reagan Farewell Photo Opportunity with Nofziger and Members of His Staff Including Lee Atwater and Ed Rollins in the Oval Office in 1982 After Richard Nixon's election as President of the United States in 1968, Nofziger served in the Nixon White House as Deputy Assistant to the President for Congressional Relations and the Republican National Committee as its Deputy Chairman for Communications. Nofziger worked for Nixon's presidential re-election campaign in 1972 as executive director of the California Committee for the Re-Election of the President. John Dean, Nixon's White House counsel, wrote that Nofziger had helped compile the Nixon White House's enemies list. As Reagan set his sights on the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, Nofziger served his campaign as Press Secretary, Convention Director, and Director of the California campaign. When Gerald Ford won the Republican nomination, Nofziger assisted with the Ford-Dole campaign, which lost the election to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Nofziger went back to work for Reagan as he began laying the groundwork for the 1980 campaign, serving as executive vice-chairman of Citizens for the Republic, a political action committee founded by Reagan. With the run for the White House in full gear in 1979, Nofziger served as deputy chairman for finance for the Reagan for President organization. Reagan won the election, defeating Carter's bid for a second term. Nofziger never sought to be Press Secretary in the White House, it being in his words \\"a young man's job\\". James Brady was named Press Secretary. Nofziger was instead named to the post of Assistant to the President for Political Affairs, and was employed in that position for about a year. Nofziger was a senior consultant for the 1984 Reagan-Bush Re-Election Campaign and a member of the 1985 Inaugural Committee. Nofziger also ran political campaigns for Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes. =Wedtech scandal= In 1987, Nofziger was investigated for allegedly violating the Ethics in Government Act when he lobbied on behalf of Wedtech Corporation, a defense contractor. Under this law, former government officials could not lobby their former office for a period of two years. Nofziger knew this, and for two years he did not lobby the Office of Political Affairs at the White House. Federal prosecutors said the law made it illegal for Nofziger to contact any office at the White House. Nofziger was indicted and later convicted of violating the law. Nofziger vigorously fought the indictment and conviction, which was eventually overturned on appeal. The government pressed its case to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to reinstate the conviction. =Memoir= Nofziger's political memoir, titled Nofziger, was published in October 1992 by Regnery Publishing. He wrote four Western novels with a hero named Tackett, a drifter who falls into situations that compel him to rescue women in distress. The Tackett series was an homage to Nofziger's friend, Louis L'Amour, author of The Sacketts and scores of other Westerns. =Death= Nofziger died at his home in Falls Church, Virginia of cancer at the age of 81. =Anti-metrication= Nofziger and Frank Mankiewicz were major players in halting the 1970s metrication effort in the United States, largely by convincing President Ronald Reagan to shut down the United States Metric Board.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1993 to 1997, and was a secretary of state in the government of Jean Chrétien. He was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1998 until 2013, and the member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for River Heights since 1999. Early life and private career Gerrard was born in Birmingham, England, and grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from the University of Saskatchewan (1967), a Doctor of Medicine degree from McGill University (1971), a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Minnesota (1976), and a Certificate in Pediatrics from the American Academy of Pediatrics (1976).David Kuxhaus, \\"Grits pick Gerrard as their saviour\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 October 1998, A1. He worked at several prominent American institutions in the 1970s, and returned to Canada in 1980 to accept a position as pediatrician at the Winnipeg Children's Hospital.Girard, p. 169. Gerrard served as head of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at this hospital from 1985 to 1992, and taught at the University of Manitoba from 1980 to 1993.William Neville, \\"A voice in the Grit wilderness\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 August 1998, A10. He has authored or co-authored over 200 scientific publications, and became known during the 1980s as an expert on the research and treatment of children's cancer.Joan Bryden, \\"Chrétien revives politics of joy\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 24 July 1993, A9.\\"About Jon Gerrard\\" , Manitoba Liberal Party online document, accessed 25 July 2007. Gerrard has also been interested in bald eagles since his teenaged years, and co-authored a book entitled The Bald Eagle: Haunts and Habits of a Wilderness Monarch in 1988.\\"Researcher works to secure future of Canada's bald eagles\\", Toronto Star, 20 November 1988, C11. He has been studying eagles at Besnard Lake in Saskatchewan for 50 years. Gerrard became active with the Liberal Party of Canada while working on his undergraduate degree, impressed with Prime Minister Lester Pearson's positions on social and international issues.Gary Girard, \\"Jon Gerrard: The Building Continues\\", in Jon Gerrard, Battling For A Better Manitoba, (Winnipeg: Heartland Associates, Inc.), 2006, p. 147. See also Alison Mayes, \\"Bringing the brain to bear\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 May 2007, B4. He was a delegate to the Liberal Party's 1968 leadership convention, supporting John Turner.Girard, p. 168. Gerrard believed that Turner best understand the concerns of Western Canada. He later volunteered for the \\"Non\\" side in the 1980 Quebec referendum, and became Liberal riding president for Lisgar in 1984. In 1990, he was Manitoba co-chair of Jean Chrétien's successful bid for the Liberal Party leadership.\\"Agriculture a priority\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 1993; Daniel Lett, \\"Plenty of plums at Grit picnic\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 September 2002, A12; Girard, p. 171. Government minister Gerrard was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 federal election, defeating two-term Progressive Conservative incumbent Felix Holtmann in the riding of Portage—Interlake.The Liberal Party's nomination contest was closely contested among Gerrard and two other candidates. He was selected on the third ballot. See Girard, p. 175. On November 4, 1993, he was appointed as Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development. This was not a full cabinet portfolio, but was instead affiliated with Industry Canada.Alan Toulin, \\"Cabinet likely to impress business\\", Financial Post, 5 November 1993, 9. Gerrard worked closely with Industry Minister John Manley, and oversaw the development of such programs as Technology Partnerships Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the Canada Research Chairs.Girard, p. 177. =Internet and communications strategies= Gerrard outlined the Chrétien government's strategy for the burgeoning information highway in February 1994, as internet use increased throughout the country. One of this strategy's goals was to \\"[put] Canada in cyberspace\\", by creating a \\"national network of networks\\" within the new media. Gerrard indicated that his plan would be targeted toward creating jobs, reinforcing Canada's cultural identity, and ensuring universal internet access at affordable rates.Jonathan Chevreau, \\"Ottawa to push 'open' highway\\", Financial Post, 3 February 1994, p. 3. He officially launched an $80 million action plan on January 30, 1995, providing funding for online applications in the fields of business, research, health care and education.Carlton Student, \\"$80 million paves highway to future\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 January 1995; \\"CANARIE launches new technology and applications development program\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 30 January 1995, 17:00. Previously, in August 1994, Gerrard had indicated an interest in developing a national system of electronic libraries. See Jim Bronskill, \\"Council ponders electronic libraries\\", Hamilton Spectator, 20 August 1994, B7. In 1997, he indicated that his government was working to make the internet available for all Canadians. See Grant Buckler, \\"Internet Access A Canadian Concern\\", Newsbytes News Network, 8 January 1997. In March 1994, Gerrard described the internet as \\"very much a Liberal technology in the sense that it is much more individual than collective\\".Lynne Stefanchuk, \\"Ottawa takes ride on superhighway\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 March 1994. Speaking to an interviewer in 2007, he said that the highlight of his political career was convincing the Chrétien government to include a reference to the information highway in its first throne speech.Alison Mayes, \\"Bringing the brain to bear\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 May 2007, B4. Gerrard's 1994 strategic statement on the information highway also addressed the subject of industry mergers in the communications sector. He indicated that the Chrétien government would \\"apply pro-competition policies wherever ... they make sense\\"Jonathan Chevreau, \\"Ottawa to push 'open' highway\\", Financial Post, 3 February 1994, p. 3; Monta Kerr, \\"Delegates call for joint effort in development of 'highway.'\\", Computing Canada, 16 February 1994, Vol. 20 No. 4, p. 1. and added: =Science and technology strategies= In June 1994, Manley and Gerrard ordered a full review of federal science and technology policy. This process had three aspects: an internal review, an independent assessment from the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology, and a series of consultations with interested Canadians.Alan Toulin, \\"Liberals reinventing science and technology policy\\", Financial Post, 12 July 1994, p. 9. Gerrard personally supervised the review's consultative sessions, and was appointed as vice-chairman of the National Advisory Board.Agnes Bongers, \\"Industry, research must work together, Ottawa told\\", Hamilton Spectator, 10 August 1994, D6; Neville Nankivell, \\"Inventing a new science policy\\", Financial Post, 3 August 1995, 9. The government's new strategy was issued in March 1996, outlining new plans for funding and tax credits.Neville Nankivell, \\"National strategy sees potential for job growth\\", Financial Post, 12 March 1996, 15; David Crane, \\"At last a plan for tech spending\\", Toronto Star, 12 March 1996, D2. The Chrétien government's approach to funding the science and technology sectors was given mixed reviews. Some criticized the government for cutting a number of research and science positions during the recession of the early 1990s,Paul Gessell, \\"Ottawa 'tragically short-sighted' in science cuts\\", Hamilton Spectator, 8 June 1995, A13. although at least one technological journal credited it with maintaining research and development incentives in the austerity budget of 1995.Gerrard indicated that the government wanted to have \\"the best tax regime in the world for science and technology\\". See Andy Shaw, \\"High-technology industry escapes federal budget axe\\", Computing Canada, 15 March 1995, p. 5. Gerrard himself was described a \\"passionate advocate\\" of research investment, and as the driving force behind the government's National Technology Investment Program of 1996.Dennis Bueckert, \\"Ottawa plans fund to aid high-tech firms\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 January 1996, B7. See also John Douglas Kevin Rollason, \\"City poised to cash in on fund\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 January 1996, B4. He also played a role in preserving the federal government's funding for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, during a period of cutbacks to Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. See \\"Neutrino project ducks federal axe\\", Globe and Mail, 26 March 1996, A4. =Additional duties= Gerrard was given additional responsibilities as Secretary of State for Western Economic Diversification on January 25, 1996. He oversaw the expansion of the Community Futures Development Corporation Network throughout Western Canada, and worked with Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy to ensure a secure transition of the Port of Churchill rail line from Canadian National to OmniTRAX.Girard, p. 179. =Other= Gerrard voted in favour of the Chrétien government's national gun registry program in late 1994, despite some personal reservations. The registry was unpopular with many rural Manitobans, and Gerrard remarked to John Manley soon after the vote that it would likely cost him his seat in the next election. =1997 election= The Portage—Interlake riding disappeared with redistribution before the 1997 election. Gerrard ran in the new riding of Selkirk—Interlake, and lost to Reform Party candidate Howard Hilstrom by 66 votes in a very close three-way contest.There were a number of recounts before the result was finalized. See Carlton Student, \\"Gerrard appeals ruling during judicial recount\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 June 1997, A4; \\"Gerrard bows to Reform win\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 1997, A7. Gerrard returned to his work at the Winnipeg Children's Hospital after his defeat. He also became a Medical Research Council of Canada scholar in residence at the University of Manitoba's medical school and applied to become Dean of Medicine,Bud Robertson, \\"Gerrard considers return to politics\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 June 1998, A8. as well as returning to his research work on bald eagles.In late 1997, he argued there was evidence northern bald eagles have the ability to produce more female offspring in food-rich regions, and more male offspring in areas where food is scarce. See Manfred Jager, \\"Ex-MP finds eagles' gender based on food\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 November 1997, A6. Leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party Gerrard returned to active political life in 1998, as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party. After winning only three seats in the 1995 provincial election and losing its official status in the legislature, the provincial Liberal Party had nearly disintegrated in 1997 under the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield.Some party members spoke of Gerrard as a possible successor to Hasselfield as early as December 1997. See Melanie Verhaege, \\"Does anyone want Liberals' top job?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 December 1997, A6. She resigned in February 1998, and Gerrard declared his candidacy to succeed her. Supported by former leader Sharon Carstairs, he defeated the only other candidate, former Sagkeeng First Nation chief Jerry Fontaine.\\"Gerrard's leadership bid backed by Carstairs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 September 1998, A4. =Elections= 1999 Gerrard set modest goals for his party in the 1999 provincial election, saying that the Liberals could win between ten and fifteen seats to hold the balance of power in a minority government.Kim Guttormson, \\"Low-key Liberal leader sets sights on 10-15 seats\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 August 1999, A6. He focused his attention on health care, and pledged that he would serve as his own Minister of Health if elected as Premier.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba Grits plan return from wilderness\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 March 1999, A4. He argued that the New Democratic Party's plan for health care would \\"throw money\\" at the provincial health system without a comprehensive plan for improvement. See David Kuxhaus, \\"Doer touts $15-M plan to repair health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 August 1999, A1. He also promised to appoint a health ombudsman, commit $25 million toward repairing provincial infrastructure, provide $20 million for post- secondary education, end provincial clawbacks of federal tax credits for welfare recipients, and create a new Ministry of Digital Economy and the Information Highway.Kim Guttormson, \\"Liberal leader recycles '95 pledge on health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 August 1999, A5 [ombudsman]; \\"Ruling Tories promise new grads a 25 per cent tax cut in Manitoba\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 25 August 1999, A5 [information]; Scott Edmonds, \\"Liberal candidate pledges to rebuild crumbling highways, sewerage\\"; Linda Rosborough, \\"Grits pledge $20M for learning\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 September 1999, A8 [education]; \\"Manitoba Grits run on antipoverty platform\\", Globe and Mail, 1 September 1999, A5 [clawbacks]; Kim Guttormson, \\"Gerrard reveals high-tech strategy\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 December 1999, A9. The Liberal Party was unable to run a full electoral slate, fielding candidates in only 50 of 57 divisions.Duncan Morrison, \\"198 candidates in race as nominations close\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 September 1999, A9. Gerrard tried to deflect criticism by joking that he would \\"put his 50 Liberal candidates up against 57 Tory and NDP candidates any day\\", but the failure to run a full slate unquestionably damaged his party's prospects.Kim Guttormson, \\"Liberals fail to field full slate of hopefuls\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 September 1999, A8; David Kuxhaus, \\"Gerrard asks Manitoba Grits\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 March 2000, A3. On election day, Gerrard personally defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Mike Radcliffe in the upscale Winnipeg division of River Heights, but the Liberals did not win any other seats. The party's popular vote fell from 23% to 13%, as many former Liberal voters shifted to the victorious New Democratic Party under Gary Doer.Douglas Nairne, \\"It's Premier Doer! Collapse of Liberal vote swings province to NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1999, A1. See also Kim Guttormson, \\"Gerrard the last Liberal standing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1999, A1; Kim Guttormson, \\"Lonely Grit: Gerrard says party is not dead\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 September 1999, B7. As his party did not regain official party status in the legislature, Gerrard did not receive funding to hire researchers. See David Kuxhaus, \\"Life at legislature no party as Gerrard faces 'challenge'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 October 1999, A11. Gerrard was the only Liberal member of the Manitoba legislature between 1999 and 2003. He was not personally blamed for the party's loss, and was reaffirmed as party leader in 2000.David Kuxhaus, \\"Grits back Gerrard, reject leadership race\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 March 2000, A3. Gerrard won 74% support from party delegates. 2003 Popular support for the Liberal Party increased after the 1999 election, reaching 24% in July 2001 and remaining in the low twenties throughout 2002 and 2003.Aldo Santin, \\"Growing Liberal support hits 24%\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 July 2001, A4; Helen Fallding, \\"Doer? I don't even know her!\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 March 2002, A1 [note: actual article title]; Mia Rabson, \\"Election fever Raging at Legislature\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 March 2003, A9. Gerrard voted for the Doer government's budget shortly before the 2003 election was called, citing a significant expansion in health-care revenues from the federal government. See \\"Gerrard backs budget despite concerns\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2003, A4. The party entered the 2003 election in a much improved position from four years earlier: their divisions were largely resolved and their financial situation more secure, and they were able to field a candidate in every division.Mia Rabson, \\"Enthusiastic Liberals set vote sights high\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 April 2003, B3. Gerrard promised tax cuts for Manitobans under thirty and the elimination of the province's payroll tax,Mia Rabson, \\"Gerrard would slash taxes for Manitobans under 30\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 April 2003, A6; Mia Rabson, \\"Tories, Liberals spell out tax cuts\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 May 2003, A1. and committed to a \\"health-care guarantee\\" wherein the government would fund out-of-province health care if services could not be provided within Manitoba.Scott Edmonds, \\"Manitoba New Democrats seek new mandate, call election for June 3\\", Canadian Press, 2 May 2003, 15:54. He also promised to create an organization that would integrate health services from different fields,Daniel Lett, \\"Doer touts 5-point plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 2003, A1. and to establish community health centres for seniors.Leah Janzen, \\"Liberals offer seniors community health centres\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 2003, A4.Gerrard also promised to increase the province's share of public education funding from 57.5% to 80% over a period of five years, with a $222 million cash infusion. See Nick Martin, \\"Liberal policies best of bad lot: trustees\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 2003, A5. On infrastructure, he promised that over $200 million of Manitoba's fuel tax revenues would be put directly into building and improving the province's roads and highways system. See Leah Janzen, \\"Gerrard wants fuel taxes spent on roads, highways\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 May 2003, A8. Liberal support declined in the final stage of the campaign,Leah Janzen, \\"Gerrard changes tack in last days\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 May 2003, A12. Shortly before the election, Liberal support had fallen to 13%. and the party ultimately polled a slightly lower percentage of votes relative to its 1999 result. Gerrard was nevertheless returned without difficulty in River Heights, and former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Kevin Lamoureux gave the party a second seat by retaking his old division of Inkster.Support for the Liberal Party returned to 21% by the end of the year, fell to 14% in March 2006, and rose again to 18% in October of the same year. See \\"Nearly half of electorate backs Doer government\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 December 2003, A7; Mia Rabson, \\"Tories strong again: poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 March 2006, A5; Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba NDP, Tories in dead heat for voters\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 October 2006, A1. 2007 The Liberal Party's 2007 campaign was centred around five issues: health care waiting lists, threatened emergency room closures in Winnipeg, university funding, urban sprawl, and the environmental state of Lake Winnipeg.Joe Paraskevas, \\"'Underdog' Liberals have ideas, high hopes\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 April 2007, A1; Joe Paraskevas, \\"Gerrard sets sights on saving Lake Winnipeg\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 April 2007, A3; Joe Paraskevas, \\"Liberals promise wait-free visits to family doctors\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 2007, A4; Mia Rabson, \\"Mental health services 'failing' Gerrard says system needs an overhaul\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 May 2007, A4. The Liberals also pledged to provide immediate funding for rapid-transit in Winnipeg,Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Gerrard favours rapid transit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 April 2007, web extra. phase out the provincial payroll tax while reducing property taxes by as much as 30%,Joe Paraskevas, \\"Liberals pledge to wipe out payroll tax, boost research\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 2007, A7; Joe Paraskevas, \\"Gerrard promises 80/20 ratio for education funding\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 2007, A4; Joe Paraskevas, \\"Liberals envision bone care network\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 May 2007, A6. and introduce a new police unit to protect children from sexual exploitation.Joe Paraskevas, \\"Liberals want special police unit for kids\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2007, A5. The party also stressed an environmentally conscious image, purchasing carbon credits to run a carbon-neutral campaign.Mia Rabson, \\"Gerrard to go green with carbon- neutral campaign\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 March 2007, B7. Gerrard and Lamoureux were again returned to the legislature, but no other Liberals were elected and the party's popular vote slipped again to just under 12.5%. =Issues= Health care Gerrard has remained involved with health issues throughout his time in the legislature. In 2001, he protested the Doer government's decision to close an outpatient pharmacy at the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre by bringing several families of child cancer patients to the legislature to confront the health minister.Mia Rabson, \\"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... Everywhere Man\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 May 2002, A12. He later called for changes to Manitoba's adult heart surgery program, after figures obtained through a freedom of information request showed an increasing number of fatalities.Mia Rabson, \\"Heart surgery mortality rate raises concern\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 July 2002, A3; \\"Manitoba Liberal leader says something must be done to stop cardiac deaths\\", Canadian Press, 15 July 2002, 20:18. In April 2004, Gerrard published a favourable review of Michael Rachlis's \\"Prescription for Excellence\\", a book on reforming Canada's health care system. See Jon Gerrard, \\"A new prescription for health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 April 2004, B9. Gerrard wrote a Winnipeg Free Press column criticizing the Doer government for health-care delays in 2005,\\"Manitoba must provide timely access to health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 July 2005, A11. and later argued that personal health information should be made more easily accessible to patients and their families.Leah Janzen, \\"Speed access to info on patients: Gerrard\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 February 2006, A5.Gerrard has also argued that the Minister of Health should report on the performance of individual surgeons. See Mia Rabson, \\"Gerrard calls for cardiac report cards\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 December 2001, A4. He released a detailed document promoting change in Manitoba's health system in September 2007, highlighted by a call to make regional health authorities more accountable to citizens.\\"Liberal's dose\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2007, A10. Agriculture and environment Shortly after the 1999 election, Gerrard took part in an all-party delegation to Ottawa to lobby the federal government for a cash bailout for struggling western farmers.David Kuxhaus, \\"Prairie politicians band together to plead farmers' case\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 October 1999, A3. In early 2004, Gerrard wrote a guest column in the Winnipeg Free Press calling on the federal government to test every beef and dairy cow over thirty months for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This recommendation was made during a significant decline in the Canadian cattle market, after the discovery of a BSE-infected cow in Alberta caused the United States to block all Canadian cattle.\\"A BSE-Free Guarantee Contingency plan needed for beef industry\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 March 2004, A9. Also in 2004, Gerrard accused the Doer government of undermining its water-quality legislation by reducing funds for key programs.\\"Budget cut may affect water quality: Gerrard\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 2004, A5. Social issues Gerrard holds liberal views on social issues. He pressured the Doer government to legalize adoption rights for same-sex couples in 2001,Mia Rabson, \\"PCs back gay adoption?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 June 2001, A3. one year before a comprehensive bill including adoption rights was passed by the legislature.Mia Rabson, \\"Tories flip-flop, vote against adoption rights for gay couples\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 August 2002, A2. Gerrard took part in the Winnipeg Harvest Poverty Challenge in late 2002, and attempted to live for a full week on only $20. The challenge was meant to draw attention to the difficulties faced by Manitoba's lowest-income residents, living on social assistance.Lindor Reynolds, \\"Trying to eat on $20 a week\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 November 2002, A1; Rob Knodel, \\"Harvest hosts a real survivor challenge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 December 2002, 1. In 2003, Gerrard supported calls for a provincial smoking ban in workplaces and enclosed public spaces.Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba to butt out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 November 2003, A1. Other issues In early 2005, Gerrard wrote that the Doer government had not taken proper steps to regulate the province's burgeoning internet pharmaceutical industry. This industry was popular with American customers, and Gerrard's column was written at a time when the federal government was seeking to impose greater control over the sector.Jon Gerrard, \\"Laws needed for delivery of distance health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 January 2005, A11. In April 2007, Gerrard introduced a private member's bill entitled the Apology Act, to make apologies inadmissible in court as proof of liability or guilt. The bill was modeled after similar legislation in British Columbia, and was intended to allow medical professionals to apologize to patients without risking legal charges.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Saying sorry to be made less costly?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 April 2007, A7.

Originally code named GM10, it began development in 1982 under Chairman Roger B. Smith and debuted in 1987 with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal, and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coupés. The four-door sedan version was introduced for 1990. Starting with the 2nd Gen 110.5 in wheelbase in 1996 it became a full-size platform as well as a 109 in wheelbase mid-size; from 2005 on the 3rd gen 110.5 in wheelbase full-size was the only version through its discontinuation in 2016. History The platform cost $7 billion to develop and was to replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick on the G and A platforms. This ultimately did not happen; while the A-platform Chevrolet Celebrity and Pontiac 6000 were quickly discontinued, the A-body Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera remained in production until 1996. The engineering work was done by the Chevrolet- Pontiac-Canada (CPC) group; also known as the small car division. The plan was for seven GM plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but GM’s 1984 reorganization, combined with changing market dynamics, wrought havoc with the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10's were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every car it produced. 1996 Buick Regal with Transverse leaf spring rear suspension The later revision of this platform was known as the MS2000 or simply the W2-Car. Early versions used a transversely installed, fiberglass mono-leaf spring combined with struts in the rear. The \\"generation 1.5\\" W-body models had updated rear suspensions that used coil springs instead of the transverse leaf spring design inspired by the Chevrolet Corvette. For the 1997 model year the second generation W-body was released with a MacPherson strut coil spring design. The W platform was updated in 2004 rather than being replaced by a stretched Epsilon platform, as had been planned. Metal fabrication of the floor pan for W-body cars was performed at the Parma Metal Center in Parma, Ohio. The cars were built at GM's Oshawa Car Assembly. The transverse use of GM's LS small- block engine in the W-bodies was a major addition for 2005. The GM W Platform was phased out with the production of the new long-wheelbase Epsilon II platform. The last car produced on the W platform was the ninth generation of the Chevrolet Impala, which was replaced by the Epsilon-based tenth-generation Impala, beginning in model year 2014. GM continued to produce the W-body Impala to fleet customers only under the name Impala Limited until production ended in May 2016.

The family's best-known recent member was Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg – the key figure in the 1944 \\"20 July plot\\" to assassinate Adolf Hitler.  History  The recorded history of the Schenk von Stauffenberg family begins in Swabia in the 13th century, when the family, who belonged to the Reichsrittern (Imperial Knights), originated from the settlement Cell, where they owned extensive estates surrounding the village and the Zollerberg long before the Counts of Zollern (Hohenzollern family/dynasty) took possession of the mountain and acquired lands there. Its first known member is mentioned in 1251 as Wernherus Pincerna de Celle, who in 1255 was appointed to the ceremonial court office of Schenk (cupbearer, sommelier, butler) with the Counts of Zollern. The officeholder was in charge of his lord's wine cellars and vineyards, and when the office of Schenk later became hereditary within the family, the title was adopted into the family name. Surnames were appended according to the officeholder's place of residence, and so the family name varied between Schenk von Zell, Schenk von Neuenzell, Schenk von Andeck, Schenk von Erpfingen and Schenk von Stauffenberg. By the end of the 15th century, the family's permanent name was Schenk von Stauffenberg, which refers to Burg Stauffenberg, a former castle situated by a small cone-shaped mountain of the same name between the small town of Hechingen and its suburb Rangendingen in Land Württemberg. A tradition in the family also associates it with the Staufen dynasty. The Stauffenbergs rose in the world in 1698 when Emperor Leopold I conferred upon the brothers Maximilian Gottfried and Johann Philipp the hereditary title of Reichsfreiherr (Imperial Baron). The family was later split into four branches: the Katzensteiner, Bacher, Wilflinger and Amerdinger ones. The former two became extinct during the 18th century, while a member of the Wilflinger branch was raised to the rank of hereditary Reichsgraf (Imperial Count) by Emperor Leopold II in 1785. Since the Wilflinger branch also became extinct in 1833, only the baronial Amerdinger branch remained. All now living members of the family are descendants of the brothers Franz Ludwig and Friedrich of the Amerdinger branch. Franz Ludwig was made a hereditary Graf (Count) in the Kingdom of Bavaria by King Ludwig II. Since then, there exist two sub- branches: one which holds the title of Count and one which bears the title of Imperial Baron. In the 16th century, the Stauffenberg family acquired the castle Amerdingen near Nördlingen through marriage. Before that, the Stauffenbergs were owners of Wilflingen and Jettingen. Over the course of the years, further estates were added to the family's possessions, such as Schloss Greifenstein and Schloss Burggrub in Heiligenstadt near Bamberg, the Lautlingen castle near Ebingen on the southern slopes of the Schwäbische Alb, Schloss Rißtissen some twenty kilometers south of Ulm, and the Straßberg and Wildentierberg estates in Lautlingen near Albstadt. After 1918, when the constitution of the Weimar Republic abolished all noble titles in Germany and declared them to be part of the family name, the family came to have two names in order to preserve the former titles of Schenk, Graf (Count) and Freiherr (Baron) as parts of the surnames. Since the title of Schenk is considered to be of superior rank due to being a hereditary office title, it is placed before the noble title, which in turn is placed before the surname. The correct versions of the family's surnames are thus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and Schenk Freiherr von Stauffenberg respectively. Two of the family's members also served as Prince-Bishops of Bamberg (Marquard Sebastian) and Augsburg and Konstanz (Johann Franz), and thus they used the title of Fürst (Prince) instead of their other noble titles.

Biography Dafoe was born in Madoc, Ontario, the son of a physician. He trained in the same profession and, in early 1909, he went into practice in Callander, Ontario, where he resided for the rest of his life. On 28 May 1934 he assisted in the multiple births of the Dionne family, that saw the survival of the mother and all the children. This got international press notice. He continued to help care for the children for years, and became something of a celebrity in the onslaught of media attention. In response to public interest, a special nursery was built for the children where the curious members of the public viewed them. There was no charge to this, so it did not give the impression to the viewers they were exploiting the children. This was generally approved of at the time, but later generated criticism for the sideshow atmosphere it produced. Souvenir stands and other concessions surrounded the area where the quints lived. Once the quints were born, Dafoe became one of their guardians, and he devoted little work to his medical practice, turning it over to others. He became wealthy from his pay as guardian and from multiple commercial endorsements and speaking fees. In The Country Doctor (1936), a movie starring the quints, Jean Hersholt portrayed Dr. John Luke, a character based on Dafoe, and there were two sequels: Reunion (1936) and Five of a Kind (1938). When Dafoe blocked the idea of continuing the series, Hersholt created Dr. Christian, which had a long run on radio. Dafoe's induction into the Circus Saints and Sinners Club of New York as \\"Doctor of Litters\\" in 1938 drew much criticism from French-Canadian groups who suggested such an honour (howbeit facetious; he arrived in a Rural Free Delivery wagon emblazoned \\"A. R. Dafoe-- Mass Deliveries\\") was condescending and against the best interests of the quintuplets; such, in fact, eventually being used by the quints' father, Oliva, in his subsequent case to reclaim custody. Dafoe was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his work with the Dionne quintuplets. He died on 2 June 1943 at age 60 from pneumonia and complications from cancer, and is buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada Today, his home is the Callander Bay Heritage Museum and Alex Dufresne Gallery in Callander, Ontario.

Built in 1930, it is one of the first two dormitories at Harvard University constructed under President Abbott Lawrence Lowell's House Plan and one of the seven Houses given to Harvard by Edward Harkness. In the early days, room rents varied based on the floor and the size of the room. Dunster was unique among Harvard dormitories for its sixth-story walk-up (it had no elevators); these rooms were originally rented by poorer students, such as Norman Mailer. The House was named in honor of Henry Dunster, the first President of Harvard University. History The tower of Dunster House is inspired by, but somewhat smaller than, the famous Tom Tower of Christ Church, Oxford. Above the east wing is the Dunster family coat of arms, and above the west wing is the coat of arms of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Henry Dunster matriculated in 1627. Magdalene College commemorated the relationship between the two universities by sending medieval tracery stones from the First Court of Magdalene; these are now set in the wall near the doors to J-entry of Dunster House. Dunster is located on the banks of the Charles River next to the John W. Weeks Footbridge, which links Harvard's Allston and Cambridge campuses. From above, its architectural shape, unusual among the River Houses, resembles a branching flowchart due to the odd trapezoidal footprint of the land on which it was built. Dunster underwent a \\"full House renewal,\\" a comprehensive renovation that was completed in 2016. It was the first of Harvard's residential houses to undergo such a full renewal. Dunster, like many of the Harvard Houses, has many yearly traditions, including Keg Races in the fall, Messiah sing-a-long in the winter, the Goat Roast in the spring, and the yearly Dunster House Opera. It is known as one of the more social houses at Harvard, boasting popular Stein Clubs and formals in either the beautiful dining hall or courtyard. As of the 2017-2018 academic year, Dunster's Faculty Deans (formerly known as \\"house masters\\") are Sean Kelly and Cheryl Chen. The House's first master was Chester N. Greenough (Harvard Class of 1898), English Professor and former Dean of Harvard College. Former faculty deans/house masters include Roger Porter and Ann Porter, Raoul Bott, and Sally Falk Moore and Cresap Moore. Michael Uy currently serves as the Allston Burr Resident Dean. His predecessor was Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo. Dunster's mascot is the moose, inspired by the three golden elk on the Dunster family crest.

He was one of the most prominent Swedish authors writing in the aftermath of World War II, but his existential texts transcend time and place and continue to be widely published in Sweden and abroad. Stig Dagerman was born in Älvkarleby, Uppsala County. In the course of five years, 1945–49, he enjoyed phenomenal success with four novels, a collection of short stories, a book about postwar Germany, five plays, hundreds of poems and satirical verses, several essays of note and a large amount of journalism. Then, with apparent suddenness, he fell silent. In the fall of 1954, Sweden was stunned to learn that Stig Dagerman, the epitome of his generation of writers, had been found dead in his car: he had closed the doors of the garage and run the engine.Thompson, Laurie. 1983. Stig Dagerman. Boston: Twayne Publishers. Dagerman's works deal with universal problems of morality and conscience, of sexuality and social philosophy, of love, compassion and justice. He plunges into the painful realities of human existence, dissecting feelings of fear, guilt and loneliness. Despite the somber content, he also displays a wry sense of humor that occasionally turns his writing into burlesque or satire.Lagercrantz, Olof. 1958, 1967, 1985, 2004. Stig Dagerman. Stockholm: Norstedts Panpockets. “An imagination that appeals to an unreasonable degree of sympathy is precisely what makes Dagerman’s fiction so evocative. Evocative or not, as one might expect, of despair, or bleakness, or existential angst, but of compassion, fellow-feeling, even love.” - Alice McDermott in her foreword to Sleet: Selected Stories (David R. Godine, Publisher, 2013). The British writer Graham Greene said this about him: \\"Dagerman wrote with beautiful objectivity. Instead of emotive phrases, he uses a choice of facts, like bricks, to construct an emotion.\\"Dagerman, Stig. The Games of Night. Philadelphia and New York: Lippincott 1961. Cover quote by Graham Greene. This style is exemplified in the following excerpt from the story, \\"The Games of Night,\\" in which a young boy, Håkan, lies waiting for his drunken father to come home: ::: At night, all waking thoughts revolve around one thing, one moment. ::: And even Håkan's deepest sleep is much too fragile to block that thing out. ::: True, he hasn't heard the car pull up out front. He hasn't heard the click ::: of the light switch or the steps in the stairwell. But the key that slides into the keyhole ::: also pokes a hole in Håkan's sleep. In an instant he's awake, stricken deep by a flash ::: of delight tingling hot from his toes to his scalp. But the delight disappears nearly ::: as fast as it comes, withdrawing into a cloud of uncertainties.\\"The Games of Night\\", translation by Steven Hartman. Dagerman's work is translated into many languages, and his work continues to inspire readers, writers, musicians and filmmakers. His collected works are available in eleven volumes. Scholars have examined his writing from every possible angle: philosophical, political, psychological, journalistic, its relationship to the medium of film, and why French and Italian readers have found him particularly appealing. Artists continue to put music to his texts.The French group \\"Têtes raides\\" recorded the text of \\"Our Need for Consolation is Insatiable\\" to reggae rhythm on their CD Banco, 2007. Films have been made of his short stories, novels and famous essay \\"Our Need for Consolation Is Insatiable\\".E.g. \\" The Games of Night\\" by Dan Levy Dagerman (23 min, English, 2007); \\"Our Need for Consolation\\" by Dan Levy Dagerman (20 min, English, 2012) The Stig Dagerman Society in Sweden annually awards the Stig Dagerman Prize to individuals who, like Dagerman, through their work promote empathy and understanding. In 2008, the prize went to the French writer J. M. G. Le Clézio, who later was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.http://www.dagerman.se Life and work Stig Dagerman, born in 1923, spent his childhood on a small farm in Älvkarleby, where he lived with his paternal grandparents. His unwed mother gave birth on the farm but left shortly thereafter, never to return. He would see her again only when he was in his twenties. Dagerman's father, a traveling day laborer, eventually settled in Stockholm. His son joined him there at the age of eleven. Through his father, Dagerman came into contact with Anarchism and its ideological offspring, Syndicalism, and joined the Syndicalist Youth Federation. At nineteen, he became the editor of \\"Storm\\", the youth paper, and at twenty-two he was appointed the cultural editor of Arbetaren (\\"The Worker\\"), then a daily newspaper of the Syndicalist movement. In the intellectual atmosphere of the newspaper world, he met fellow writers and developed a taste for polemical writing. In addition to editorials and articles, Dagerman wrote more than a thousand daily poems, many highly satirical, commenting on current events. He called \\"Arbetaren\\" his \\"spiritual birthplace\\". Dagerman's horizons were greatly expanded by his marriage in 1943 to Annemarie Götze, an eighteen-year- old German refugee. Her parents, Ferdinand and Elly, were prominent Anarcho- Syndicalists, and the family escaped Nazi Germany to be at the center of the movement in Barcelona. When Spanish fascists brutally crushed the Anarcho- Syndicalist social experiment there, the Götzes fled through France and Norway, with Hitler's army at their heels, to a neutral Sweden. Dagerman and his young wife lived with his in-laws, and it was through this family, and the steady stream of refugees that passed through their home, that Dagerman felt he could sense the pulse of Europe. In 1945, Stig Dagerman at age twenty-two published his first novel Ormen (The Snake). It was an anti-militaristic story with fear as its main theme, channeling the war-time zeitgeist. Positive reviews gave him a reputation as a brilliant young writer of great promise. He left \\"Arbetaren\\" to write full-time. The following year, Dagerman published De dömdas ö (The Island of the Doomed), completed over a fortnight during which, he says, it was as if he \\"let god do the writing\\". Using nightmarish imagery, this was an allegory centered on seven shipwrecked people, each doomed to die, each seeking a form of salvation. Critics have compared Dagerman's works to those of Franz Kafka, William Faulkner and Albert Camus. Many see him as the main representative of a group of Swedish writers called “Fyrtiotalisterna” (“the writers of the 1940s”) who channeled existentialist feelings of fear, alienation and meaninglessness common in the wake of the horrors of World War II and the looming Cold War.Articles In 1946, Dagerman became a household name in Sweden through his newspaper travelogue from war-ravaged Germany, later published in book form with the title Tysk Höst (German Autumn). Rather than blaming the German people for the war's atrocities, calling them crazed or evil, Dagerman portrayed the human ordinariness of the men and women who scraped by in the ruins of war. To him, the root of disaster lay in the anonymity of mass organizations that obstructed empathy and individual responsibility, qualities without which the human race is threatened by extinction. :::“I believe that man’s natural enemy is the mega-organization :::because it robs him of the vital necessity to feel responsible for his fellow-man, :::restricting his possibilities to show solidarity and love :::and instead turns him into an agent of power, :::that for the moment may be directed against others, :::but ultimately is directed against himself.”From “Do we believe in man?” 1950, Stig Dagerman Essäer och journalistik, transl. Lo Dagerman The short story collection Nattens lekar (The Games of Night), published in 1947, met with high acclaim.Short review of the stories https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Coffeehouse/4587/issue7.html%23dagerman&date;=2009-10-25+09:59:25 Many of the stories were set on his grandparents’ farm, and are written from a child's perspective. Dagerman used a tender naturalistic style that appeals to a wide audience. This same year his first play “Den dödsdömde” (“The Man Condemned to Death”) opened in Stockholm to rave reviews. The most famous of Dagerman's short stories, “Att döda ett barn” (“To Kill A Child”), exemplified the strong influence of film on his writing. In image after image, it portrayed in riveting detail how a series of perfectly ordinary events can be a prologue to horror. In 1948, he wrote three more plays and published his third novel Bränt barn (A Burnt Child). The story, a psychological account of a young man's infatuation with his father's mistress, was written in a tight, naturalistic style. Dagerman wrote only one more novel: Bröllopsbesvär (Wedding Worries), published in 1949, regarded by some as his best. In this novel, he returned one final time to the setting of his grandparents’ farm and characters to describe the human condition, including a search for forgiveness and salvation. In this book, Dagerman, who throughout his career experimented with different literary styles, used stream-of-consciousness as a method of penetrating a character. After his early and rapid successes, expectations kept rising, not the least his own. Dagerman struggled with depression and an onset of writer's block. He became restless in the now suburbanized Götze family, and was drawn to the medium of theater. As a playwright, and even a one-time director, he met friends and lovers within the theater world, leaving his family for periods at a time. Eventually, Dagerman broke away for good to live with and later marry the celebrated actress Anita Björk, with whom he had a daughter. But the break proved difficult, emotionally and financially. Dagerman felt guilty leaving his young sons, and took on mounting debt to support his first family. The assumption being that his debt would be paid up when he were to publish his next book ... While battling deepening depression and a debilitating writer's block, Dagerman wrote an autobiographical essay “Vårt behov av tröst är omättligt” (“Our need for consolation is insatiable”) about his struggles and search for a way to stay alive. He also wrote “Tusen år hos gud” (“A Thousand Years with God”) – part of a new novel he was planning – which signaled a turn to a more mystical bent in his writing. In spite of his struggles, Dagerman continued to deliver his daily satirical verses for “Arbetaren”, the last one published on November 5, 1954, the day after his suicide.

University of Minnesota Press, 2012. All of Dagerman's oeuvre, his novels, poems and political essays are in some way contained in this stormy novel, in its whirl of sensations and images. … 'the open eyes which fearlessly scrutinize their dangerous position must be the stars of our ego, our only compass, the compass which decides which direction we take, because if there is no compass, there can be no direction.' With humble gratitude to Stig Dagerman who, in order to show us the way, let himself be consumed by his own fire. - JMG Le Clezio The Snake. Translation and introduction by Laurie Thompson. Quartet Encounters, London, 1995. The novel seems to be a collection of short stories until, in a brilliant denouement, disparate threads are brought together to reveal the underlying thematic structures. Dagerman writes with equal skill from the point of view of both sexes, and through them he examines wider issues of social justice and the psychology of fear. - Laurie Thompson The Games of Night.

Subjects and assessment VCEs were available in many subjects including Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Management, Leisure and Recreation, Travel and Tourism and Business. Some students preferred the vocational system due to its practical 'hands-on' nature. The qualification was created in September 2000 to replace the Advanced GNVQ, with the main change being that the marking system was altered from the three level Distinction, Merit and Pass system to A-E grading, bringing the AVCE into line with A-Levels. The AVCE was intended to lead on to higher education or employment and was made up of modules, each covering different aspects of the subject. Some of these modules overlapped and some institutions chose to merge their content. Students had to complete a set number of modules in order to qualify for an AVCE: *AVCE Double Award - 12 units (worth two A-levels) *AVCE Single Award - 6 units (worth one A-level) *ASVCE - 3 units (worth one AS-level) Assessment was by a mixture of continuous assessment, based on a portfolio of evidence, and externally set and marked examinations. Withdrawal The regulatory body, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), along with Welsh equivalent ACCAC, decided in June 2004 to withdraw the Advanced VCE, with the final candidates starting in September 2004. They created and piloted an \\"Applied GCE (AGCE)\\" qualification to replace the AVCE.

In 2010 Richard and Drew decided to take a break from the regular publication of a literary magazine, choosing to instead publish issues of the journal when they had an idea they were excited about (Issue 9.1 \\"The Middles Of Things\\", was the first along these new lines. 5 authors were tasked with writing the middle of a novel, but were not allowed to write the beginning or the end, they were instructed to treat it as though they'd walked into the middle of a movie, and to simply describe what they saw. Sharon McGill provided the illustrations for each piece, and Amelia Gray ordered the pieces, writing interstitial bits, creating a loose impression of a continuous narrative through the book [Amelia chose to order the pieces from most conventional to least]). In the absence of the regular magazine, they've been publishing a chapbook series, though the term \\"chapbook\\" is applied loosely: \\"This here, this mixtape? It's a chapbook. This novel? It's a chapbook. Everything we do is a chapbook.\\" ←- Drew said that, and it's how things are done. (Chapbooks have traditionally been throwaway items – the guys at Spork subvert this idea with letterpressed hardback hand- bound books, and an inattention to the rest of the things chapbooks usually are.)

He was chief of the Sagkeeng First Nation from 1989 to 1998, led the First Peoples Party in the 1995 provincial election, and was an unsuccessful candidate to lead the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1998. He was the director of Indigenous Initiatives at Algoma University from 2004-2008. Fontaine is the nephew of Assembly of First Nations leader Phil Fontaine. Early career Fontaine received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976.Dan Lett, \\"Liberals grooming aboriginal leader\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 1998, A1. He first campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 provincial election, contesting Lac du Bonnet as a Liberal. The Liberal Party was a weak electoral force in Manitoba during this period, and Fontaine received 959 votes (11.33%). The winner was Clarence Baker of the New Democratic Party. Sagkeeng chief and FPP leader Fontaine became chief of the Sagkeeng First Nation three years later, and led the community until 1998. During his tenure as Chief, Sagkeeng developed the First Nation's constitutional declaration. This declaration facilitated the Manitoba Hydro Accord, a process that enabled the community to mitigate erosion damages caused by Hydro development and enforce its jurisdiction over its traditional territory. The constitutional process mandated the First Nation's Law-Making Assembly to pass two important pieces of legislation in relation to the Hydro Accord: the Process Law and Conservation Law. He was a supporter of local gambling rights, and launched a private prosecution against the Pine Falls pulp mill in 1995 for violations of the Water Rights Act.Randy Turner, \\"Gamblers swarm palace\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 June 1993, City Page [gambling]; Kevin Rollason, \\"Sagkeeng chief charges mill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 April 1995, City Page. By his own admission, he destroyed his Liberal Party membership in 1994 when the Canadian government of Jean Chrétien relaxed anti-pollution standards in the area near his community.David Kuxhaus, \\"Fontaine feels he can mend fractured Liberal party\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 1998, A6. Fontaine became a prominent spokesman for Manitoba's First Peoples Party (FPP) later in the year and was generally recognized as the nascent party's leader, although it is not clear if he held an official position.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba natives form own party\\", The Globe and Mail, 29 November 1994, A4; Lett, \\"Liberals grooming aboriginal leader\\". The FPP was created following a 1993 resolution of the Assembly of Manitoba chiefs that advocated a political party focused on aboriginal issues.\\"Aboriginal party in Manitoba would be open to all\\", Financial Post, 30 November 1994, p. 6. The party argued that all native peoples in Canada have an inherent right to self- government and that the country's traditional political parties were not addressing aboriginal concerns.Kelly Taylor, \\"Native North shops for any port in a storm\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 1995, City Page. Fontaine emphasized that the FPP was open to all Manitobans, not simply those of aboriginal background. The party ran three candidates in the 1995 provincial election, all of whom were defeated. Fontaine ran a credible campaign in the vast northern constituency of Rupertsland, but received only 541 votes (12.22%) for a fourth-place finish against New Democrat Eric Robinson, who is also aboriginal. The FPP ceased to exist after the election. In 1998, an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation raised allegations that a separate aboriginal-issues party called Independent Native Voice (INV) had been set up by Progressive Conservative organizers to take votes from the New Democratic Party in marginal constituencies. A commission led by Judge Alfred Monnin ruled that these organizers had induced at least one candidate, Darryl Sutherland, to run. The FPP was not implicated in this scandal.\\"The 1999 Michener Award Winner\\", The Michener Awards Foundation , accessed 2006. In the year the scandal broke, Fontaine informed the media that Sutherland had approached him late in the 1995 campaign to acknowledge that Conservative organizers provided him with funds. He encouraged Sutherland to take his story to the press, although Sutherland rejected this advice at the time.Paul Samyn, \\"Prominent native leader tells of discussions in 1995\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 July 1998, A4. Fontaine has asserted that \\"the Tories took advantage of Aboriginal individuals who weren't all that involved in political issues or political life\\", and argued that the incident was symptomatic of the way aboriginal voters are sometimes treated by mainstream parties.\\"Filmon to testify at alleged election-rigging inquiry\\", The Manitoban, 18 November 1998, accessed 2006. Liberal leadership campaign Fontaine rejoined the Manitoba Liberal Party after the FPP's dissolution, and became a candidate for the party's leadership in 1998 following the resignation of Ginny Hasselfield. He was 42 years old at the time. His candidacy was organized by Ernie Gilroy, and won support from figures such as Terry Duguid and Graham Dixon.Kuxhaus, \\"Grits pick Gerrard as their saviour\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 October 1998, A1; Kuxhaus, \\"Fontaine feels he can mend fractured Liberal party\\". Fontaine emphasized that he was not a protest candidate, and his campaign did not focus exclusively on aboriginal issues. Initially regarded as the frontrunner, he lost to former Member of Parliament Jon Gerrard by 1336 votes to 832 in a mail-in ballot open to all party members. He was not a candidate in the 1999 provincial election. Wing Construction During the 1998 leadership contest, Fontaine was served with a $100,000 lawsuit from Wing Construction Limited, which had previously received a contract for school construction in Sagkeeng.Kuxhaus, \\"Liberal leader hopeful faces lawsuit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 October 1998, A1. Wing Construction argued that the Sagkeeng council had not turned over promised funds, and asserted that the company was left to sustain a loss of three million dollars.Paul Barnsley, \\"Partners battle over school construction\\", Windspeaker, April 2000 , accessed 2006. The federal government later determined that the Wing contract had not been formally approved by the Department of Indian Affairs, and the company was forced into bankruptcy protection in 2000. Fontaine characterized the personal lawsuit as \\"frivolous\\", and was later described as saying that the company had overstated the value of its work.Alan Isfeld, Letter to the Editor, Grassroots News, 28 January 2004, accessed 2006. Others have disputed this, and Alan Isfeld of the Waywayseecappo First Nation argued that the collapse of Wing Construction created a potentially destructive precedent for aboriginal/non-aboriginal partnerships in Canada.\\"Government manipulation\\", Windspeaker, January 2001 , accessed 2006. Separate from the Wing Construction controversy, some members of the Sagkeeng first nation accused Fontaine of inadequate on-reserve housing in 1998.Stevens Wild, \\"Sit-in at Sagkeeng protests lack of houses\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 August 1998, A3. He resigned as chief following a series of protests, saying that he needed to devote all of his attention to the leadership contest.Rollason, \\"Chief's quitting heartens protest\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 September 1998, A6. He later defended his financial record against what he described as a \\"continued siege by government and media alike\\".Jerry Fontaine, \\"Sagkeeng siege unwarranted\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 March 2001, A7. Since 1998 From 1998-2003, Fontaine served as Senior Advisor to the Pine Falls Paper Company. During this period he facilitated negotiations between the Pine Falls Paper Company (PFPC) and participating Anishinaabe Nations in the development of a partnership agreement between the PFPC and Anshinaabe Nations. During the period, 2003-2005 Fontaine became active in the development of the Treaty 1 Protection Office that included the following Treaty 1 First Nations (Brokenhead, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River, Sagkeeng, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake). Treaty 1 was signed August 3, 1871. In 2005, Fontaine served as an adviser to AFN leader Phil Fontaine and promoting education within Canada's aboriginal communities.\\"Aboriginal- Education\\", Broadcast News, 15 April 2005, 04:11 report. He has argued that aboriginal communities should have control over First Nations post-secondary institutions.Anne Kyle, \\"First Nations should control their own education: national chief\\", Regina Leader Post, 15 April 2005, A5. He was chosen as interim president of the First Peoples National Party of Canada, a federal party similar to the FPP, in 2005.First Peoples National Party of Canada: Interim Executive, Minutes of the October 20th meeting held at the Shingwauk University, Sault Ste. Marie, ON , accessed 12 October 2006. He continues to serve as FPNP president as of 2006. Fontaine was an administrator at Algoma University, where he worked as Director of Indigenous Initiatives.Algoma University: Administration , accessed 11 March 2007. While in the capacity of Director, Indigenous Initiatives, Fontaine also served as Sessional Lecturer. (Algoma University, Laurentian University and Shingwauk Kinoomage Gamig) Fontaine received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from (European University, Paris, France) (2000), Master of Arts (MA) from the (University of Manitoba) (2009) and Ph.D.in Indigenous Studies (Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario).

Rules There are several major rules, which differ only slightly. The \\"Official Baseball Rules\\" govern all professional play in the United States and Canada, including the World Baseball Classic. The complete rules are published as the Official Baseball Rules at MLB.com, the official web site of Major League Baseball in the United States and Canada. The rules are also published in book form in North America by the Sporting News. Many amateur and youth leagues use the \\"OBR\\" with only a few modifications for safety. Other slightly modified versions of the \\"Official Baseball Rules\\" are used in competitions operated by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), including the Olympics and the World Cup, most leagues outside North America (such as Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball), and youth baseball organizations such as Little League, PONY League, and Cal Ripken League. The baseball rulebook of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), aside from governing the games of that organization's members, is also used by several other competitions involving college-aged players. U.S. high school and high school-age baseball is governed by the rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). Differences and evolution For the origins of the game, see Origins of baseball. Unlike many other sports, the Official Baseball Rules have remained mainly static during the modern era of the game. Many baseball players, fans, and administrators view the rules and traditions of professional baseball as time-tested and nearly sacrosanct. This was not the case during baseball's early days, particularly in the late 19th century, when rules were changed significantly and often yearly. The game as we know it today really only began to take shape in the late 1880s, and even after that, many significant rule changes were made during the rest of that century. In 1857, under the NABBP Rules which governed until 1870, the current 9-inning format was adopted, replacing the previous rule that the first team to score 21 runs won. The next year called strikes were recognized, and a batter was out if a ball, fair or foul, was caught on the fly or after one bounce. Called balls and the walk were introduced in 1863. In 1867, the batter had the right to call for a high or low pitch, to be determined by the umpire. The National League formed in 1876. Its rules changed almost yearly for the next quarter century. In 1880, a batter was out if the catcher caught the third strike; otherwise, the batter got four strikes. Before 1883, pitchers were required to deliver pitches with their hand below their hips; in that year, the rule was changed to allow shoulder-high deliveries. Until 1887, batters could call for either a high or low pitch, and the strike zone was either above or below the waist. In 1885, the rules changed, until 1893, to allow bats to be flat on one side; beginning in 1893, they had to be round. In 1887, the rules changed so that batters could no longer call for a pitch; and the strike zone was defined as from the shoulders to the knees. During this period, the pitcher's mound was much closer to home plate, foul balls were not counted as strikes, batters got four strikes, and the number of \\"called balls\\" resulting in a walk—which initially included strikes and foul balls- went from 9 to 8 to 7 to 6 to 5 and, in 1889, to 4. In that same year, the number of strikes went from 4 to 3. In 1887, a rule was adopted for that year only counting walks as hits, which played havoc with statistics. In 1892, the 154 game schedule was adopted. In 1893, the pitching position was changed from behind a line 50 feet from home plate to contact with a rubber slab 60.5 feet away. In 1894, foul bunts were made strikes, and the infield fly rule was adopted with one out. In 1895, foul tips were made strikes, but not foul balls. In 1898, the first modern balk rule was adopted, as well as the modern rule for recognizing stolen bases. In 1901, the infield fly rule was extended to apply when there were no outs. Because of the frequent and often radical rule changes during this early period, the \\"modern era\\" is generally considered to have begun in 1901, when the American League was also formed. Some significant rule changes continued in the first quarter of the 20th century but were much less frequent. In 1903, the American League adopted the foul strike rule. In 1907, the sacrifice fly rule was adopted. In 1910, cork centers were added to balls. In 1925, the minimum distance for a home run was made 250 feet. Until 1929 (AL) and 1931 (NL), a ball that bounced over the outfield fence in fair territory was a home run, not a double. After that, the rules remained virtually static for decades. In 1961, the 162-game schedule was adopted. In 1969, the pitcher's mound dropped five inches and the strike zone reduced: from the armpits to the top of the knees. In 1973, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule—rejected to this day by the National League. This was probably the most controversial rule change in baseball's history and is still subject to lively debate. Also controversial when adopted was the later introduction of interleague play. The most recent significant rule changes, banning the use of steroids and other performance- enhancing substances, have had widespread support as protecting the integrity of the game. The use of steroids by many players over the last two decades has called into question records for both hitting and pitching. Gameplay =General structure= Diagram of a baseball diamond Baseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field from the team that is not batting at that point (the batting team would have one batter in play at \\"home plate\\" on the field). On a baseball field, the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three bases. Numbered counterclockwise, first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as bags) shaped as 15 in (38 cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with home plate, the fourth \\"base\\", they form a square with sides of 90 ft (27.4 m) called the diamond. Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab 17 in (43.2 cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections: *The infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure). *The outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines, and bounded by a wall or fence. *Foul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines. The pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an 18 ft (5.5 m) diameter mound of dirt no higher than 10 in (25.4 cm). Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned 60 ft 6 in (18.4 m) from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released. At the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine innings in which each team gets one turn to bat and tries to score runs while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and Little League uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves in which the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball—a fact that differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team out. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team's score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner. This is known as a walk-off. A batter follows through after swinging at a pitched ball. The basic contest is always between the pitcher for the fielding team and a batter. The pitcher throws—pitches—the ball towards home plate, where the catcher for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the batter's boxes and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher's rubber—a 24×6 in (61×15 cm) plate located atop the pitcher's mound—during the entire pitch, so he can only take one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher's job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to \\"call\\" the game by a series of hand movements that signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and \\"sets up\\" behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target. The catcher's role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new play, which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself. Each half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn at bat. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball in the air, tag outs, force outs, and strikeouts. After the fielding team has put out three players from the opposing team, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as \\"batting around\\" and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense. The goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then becoming a baserunner, touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a pinch-runner. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable baserunners to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into fair territory—between the baselines—in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all. A baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases scores a run. In an enclosed field, a fair ball hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic home run, which entitles the batter and all runners to touch all the bases and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied ('bases loaded') is called a grand slam. =Fielding team= The squad in the field is the defensive team; they attempt to prevent the baserunners from scoring. There are nine defensive positions, but only two have a mandatory location (pitcher and catcher). The locations of the other seven fielders are not specified by the rules, except that at the moment the pitch is delivered, they must be positioned in fair territory and not in the space between the pitcher and the catcher. These fielders often shift their positioning in response to specific batters or game situations, and they may exchange positions with one another at any time. The nine positions most commonly used (with the number scorekeepers use) are: pitcher (1), catcher (2), first baseman (3), second baseman (4), third baseman (5), shortstop (6), left fielder (7), center fielder (8), and right fielder (9). Note that, in rare cases, teams may use dramatically differing schemes, such as switching an outfielder for an infielder. The numbering convention was established by Henry Chadwick. The reason the shortstop seems out of order has to do with the way fielders positioned themselves in the early years of the game; the shortstop was positioned in the shallow outfield. Each position is weighted on the defensive spectrum in terms of difficulty. The most difficult position is the catcher, while the least difficult is first base. Designated hitter, while on the scale, is not part of the defense at all. Pitchers, while part of the active defense, are so specialized in their role that they usually make only routine plays. The battery The battery is composed of the pitcher, who stands on the rubber of the mound, which is also known as the pitching plate, and the catcher, who squats behind home plate. These are the two fielders who always deal directly with the batter on every pitch, hence the term \\"battery\\", coined by Henry Chadwick and later reinforced by the implied comparison to artillery fire. The pitcher's main role is to pitch the ball toward home plate with the goal of getting the batter out. Pitchers also play defense by fielding batted balls, covering bases (for a potential tag out or force out on an approaching runner), or backing up throws. The catcher's main role is to receive the pitch if the batter does not hit it. Together with the pitcher and coaches, the catcher plots game strategy by suggesting different pitches and by shifting the starting positions of the other fielders. Catchers are also responsible for defense in the area near home plate (such as dropped third strikes and wild pitches) or baserunning plays, most commonly when an opposing player attempts to steal a base. Due to the exceptional difficulty of the position, catchers are universally valued for their defensive prowess as opposed to their ability to hit. The infielders The four infielders are the first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, and third baseman. Originally the first, second and third basemen played very near their respective bases, and the shortstop generally played \\"in\\" (hence the term), covering the area between second, third, and the pitchers box, or wherever the game situation required. As the game evolved, the fielding positions changed to the now-familiar \\"umbrella\\", with the first and third baseman generally positioned a short distance toward second base from their bases, the second baseman to the right side of second base standing farther away from the base than any other infielder, and the shortstop playing to the left of second base, as seen from the batter's perspective. The first baseman's job consists largely of making plays at first base on ground balls hit to the other infielders. When an infielder picks up a ball from the ground hit by the batter, he must throw it to the first baseman who must catch the ball and maintain contact with the base before the batter gets to it for the batter to be out. The need to do this quickly often requires the first baseman to stretch one of his legs to touch first base while catching the ball simultaneously. The first baseman must be able to catch the ball very well and usually wears a specially designed mitt. The first baseman fields balls hit near first base. The first baseman also has to receive throws from the pitcher in order to tag runners out who have reached base safely. The position is less physically challenging than the other positions, but there is still a lot of skill involved. Infielders don't always make good throws to first base, so it is the first baseman's job to field any ball thrown toward him cleanly. Older players who can no longer fulfill the demands of their original positions also often become first basemen. The second baseman covers the area to the first- base side of second base and provides backup for the first baseman in bunt situations. He also is a cut-off for the outfield. The cut-off provides an intermediary between an outfielder and the infield so that the outfielder does not have to throw the entire distance if they've been forced to field the ball near the outer edge of the outfield. The shortstop fills the critical gap between second and third bases—where right-handed batters generally hit ground balls—and also covers second or third base and the near part of left field. This player is also a cut-off for the outfield. This position is the most demanding defensively, so a good shortstop doesn't need to necessarily be a good batter, though this has changed in modern times. The third baseman's primary requirement is a strong throwing arm, in order to make the long throw across the infield to the first baseman. Quick reaction time is also important for third basemen, as they tend to see more sharply-hit balls than do the other infielders, thus the nickname for third base as the \\"hot corner\\". Also, because there are far more right-handed hitters than lefties, there are more ground balls hit to the left side of the infield due to the natural motion of the batter's swing. The outfielders The three outfielders, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder, are so named from the catcher's perspective looking out onto the field. The right fielder generally has the strongest arm of all the outfielders due to the need to make throws on runners attempting to take third base. The center fielder has more territory to cover than the corner outfielders, so this player must be quick and agile with a strong arm to throw balls into the infield; as with the shortstop, teams tend to emphasize defense at this position. Also, the center fielder is considered the outfield leader, and left- and right-fielders often cede to his direction when fielding fly balls. Of all outfielders, the left fielder often has the weakest arm, as they generally do not need to throw the ball as far in order to prevent the advance of any baserunners. The left fielder still requires good fielding and catching skills, and tends to receive more balls than the right fielder due to the fact that right-handed hitters, who are much more common, tend to \\"pull\\" the ball into left field. Each outfielder runs to \\"back up\\" a nearby outfielder who attempts to field a ball hit near both their positions. Outfielders also run to back up infielders on batted balls and thrown balls, including pick-off attempts from the pitcher or from the catcher. Defensive strategy =Pitching= The typical motion of a right-handed pitcher Effective pitching is critical to a baseball team, as pitching is the key for the defensive team to retire batters and to prevent runners from getting on base. A full game usually involves over one hundred pitches thrown by each team. However, most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. In previous eras, pitchers would often throw up to four complete games (all nine innings) in a week. With new advances in medical research and thus a better understanding of how the human body functions and tires out, starting pitchers tend more often to throw fractions of a game (typically six or seven innings, depending on their performance) about every five days (though a few complete games do still occur each year). A single game often requires multiple pitchers, including the starting pitcher and relief pitcher(s). Pitchers are substituted for one another like any other player (see above), and the rules do not limit the number of pitchers that can be used in a game; the only limiting factor is the size of the squad, naturally. In general, starting pitchers are not used in relief situations except sometimes during the post-season when every game is vital. If a game runs into many extra innings, a team may well empty its bullpen. If it then becomes necessary to use a \\"position player\\" as a pitcher, major league teams generally have certain players designated as emergency relief pitchers, to avoid the embarrassment of using a less skillful player. In baseball's early years, squads were smaller, and relief pitchers were relatively uncommon, with the starter normally remaining for the entire game unless he was either thoroughly ineffective or became injured; today, with a much greater emphasis on pitch count, over the course of a single game each team will frequently use from two to five pitchers. In the 2005 ALCS, all four of the Chicago White Sox victories were complete games by the starters, a highly noteworthy event in the modern game. While delivering the ball, the pitcher has a great arsenal at his disposal in the variation of location, velocity, movement, and arm location (see types of pitches). Most pitchers attempt to master two or three types of pitches; some pitchers throw up to 6 types of pitches with varying degrees of control. Common pitches include a fastball, which is the ball thrown at high speed; a curveball, which is made to curve by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a change-up, which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at significantly lower velocity; a splitfinger fastball, which attempts to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but has slight topspin rotation allowing the baseball to sink as it approaches the batter due to the position of the index finger and middle finger being \\"split\\" on the baseball; a slider, which is made to curve laterally by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a knuckleball, which is held either by the knuckles closest to the nails or by the nails themselves allowing the pitcher to throw a baseball with little or no spin on the ball allowing the baseball to move in any direction; a Vulcan changeup, which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significant lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the baseball with the middle and ring fingers slightly apart; a circle changeup, which is held in the palm of the hand with the index finger curled around the side of the baseball, allowing the pitcher to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significantly lower velocity. To illustrate pitching strategy, consider the \\"fastball/change-up\\" combination: The average major-league pitcher can throw a fastball around 90 miles per hour (145 km/h), and a few pitchers have even exceeded . The change-up is thrown somewhere between . Since the batter's timing is critical to hitting a pitch, a batter swinging to hit what looks like a fastball, would be terribly fooled (swing and miss, hopefully) when the pitch turns out to be a much slower change-up. Some pitchers choose to throw using the 'submarine style,' a very efficient sidearm or near-underhand motion. Pitchers with a submarine delivery are often very difficult to hit because of the angle and movement of the ball once released. Walter Johnson, who threw one of the fastest fastballs in the history of the game, threw sidearm (though not submarine) rather than a normal overhand. True underhanded pitching is permitted in Major League Baseball. However, it is difficult to generate enough velocity and movement with the underhand motion. Among modern Major League pitchers, Chad Bradford had the closest to an underhand delivery, with his knuckles sometimes scraping the ground. However, he is still usually considered a \\"submarine\\" pitcher. =Fielding strategy= 1906 World Series, infielders playing \\"in\\" for the expected bunt and the possible play at the plate with the bases loaded, the same strategy 112 years ago as now. Only the pitcher's and catcher's locations are fixed, and then only at the beginning of each pitch. Thus, the players on the field move around as needed to defend against scoring a run. Many variations of this are possible, as location depends upon the situation. Circumstances such as the number of outs, the count (balls and strikes) on the batter, the number and speed of runners, the ability of the fielders, the ability of the pitcher, the type of pitch thrown, the tendencies of the hitter, and the inning cause the fielders to move to more strategic locations on the field. Common defensive strategies include: playing for the bunt, trying to prevent a stolen base, moving to a shallow position to throw out a runner at home, playing at \\"double play depth\\", and moving fielders to locations where hitters are most likely to hit the ball. =Batting team= Batters and runners The ultimate goal of the team at bat is to score runs. To accomplish this task, the team at bat successively (in a predetermined order called a lineup or batting order) sends its nine players to the batter's box (adjacent to home plate) where they become batters. (Each team sets its batting lineup at the beginning of the game. Changes to the lineup are tightly limited by the rules of baseball and must be communicated to the umpires, who have the substitutions announced for the opposing team and fans. See Substitutions below.) A batter's turn at the plate is called a plate appearance. Batters can advance to first base safely in one of seven methods: a base-hit (abbreviated 'H') or walk ('BB' for base- on-balls) are by far the most common; being hit-by-the-pitch ('HBP'), reaching by error ('E') or fielder's choice ('FC') are less common; and somewhat rarely a player may reach base by virtue of interference ('I') or a passed ball ('PB') on a strike-out, where the player is allowed to run and reach base safely if he can. When the batter hits a fair ball, he must run to first base, and may continue or stop at any base unless he is put out. A successful hit occurs when the batter reaches a base: reaching only first base is a single; reaching second base, a double; third base, a triple; and a hit that allows the batter to touch all bases in order on the same play is a home run—whether the ball is hit over the fence does not matter (if the ball is not hit over the fence and the batter touches all bases, it is usually referred to as an \\"inside-the-park home run\\"). Once a runner is held to a base, he may attempt to advance at any time, but is not required to do so unless the batter or another runner displaces him (called a force play). A batter always drops his bat when running the bases; otherwise, the bat would slow him down and could give rise to a call of interference if it were to contact the ball or a fielder. However, if a batter hits the ball, and the batter or the dropped bat touches the ball, it is considered a dead ball. Depending on the way the ball comes off the bat, the play has different names. A batted ball is called a fly ball if it is hit in the air in an upward arc, such that a fielder might be able to catch it before it hits the ground. A batted ball is called a ground ball if it hits the ground within the infield before it can be caught, often due to being hit in a downward trajectory. Several different names are used to describe fly balls, depending on their trajectory. A ball hit high in the air and seemingly almost straight up is called a \\"pop-up\\". A ball hit forcefully in a fast-moving and seemingly almost straight-line trajectory is called a line drive. A \\"shallow\\" fly ball, hit with just enough force to possibly land between the infielders and the outfielders, is often call a \\"blooper\\". A \\"deep\\" fly ball is hit with enough force to approach and possibly clear the outfield fence. When a ball is hit outside the foul lines, it is a foul ball, requiring the batter and all runners to return to their respective bases, whether it is caught or not. Additionally, if a ground ball or a bunted ball lands in foul territory and the ball rolls back into bounds before reaching either first or third bases without being touched by either a fielder or a runner, then said ball is considered fair. Once the batter and any existing runners have all stopped at a base or been put out, the ball is returned to the pitcher, and the next batter comes to the plate. After the opposing team bats in its own order and three more outs are recorded, the first team's batting order will continue again from where it left off. When a runner reaches home plate, he scores a run and is no longer a base runner. He must leave the playing area until his spot in the order comes up again. A runner may only circle the bases once per plate appearance and thus can score no more than a single run. In the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a designated hitter, who bats for the pitcher. Batting Each plate appearance consists of a series of pitches, in which the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate while a batter is standing in the batter's box (either right or left). With each pitch, the batter must decide whether to swing the bat at the ball in an attempt to hit it. The pitches arrive quickly, so the decision to swing must be made in less than a tenth of a second, based on whether the ball is hittable and in the strike zone, a region defined by the area directly above home plate and between the hollow beneath the batter's knee and the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. In addition to swinging at the ball, a batter who wishes to put the ball in play may hold his bat over home plate and attempt to tap a pitch lightly; this is called a bunt. Good bunting technique has been described as \\"catching the ball with the bat.\\" On any pitch, if the batter swings at the ball and misses, he is charged with a strike. If the batter does not swing, the home plate umpire judges whether the ball passed through the strike zone. If the ball, or any part of it, passed through the zone, it is ruled a strike; otherwise, it is called a ball. The number of balls and strikes thrown to the current batter is known as the count; the count is always given balls first (except in Japan, where it is reversed), then strikes (such as 3–2 or \\"three and two\\", also known as a \\"full count\\", which would be 3 balls and 2 strikes). If the batter swings and makes contact with the ball, but does not put it in play in fair territory—a foul ball—he is charged with an additional strike, except when there are already two strikes. Thus, a foul ball with two strikes leaves the count unchanged. (However, a noted exception to this rule is that a ball bunted foul with two strikes is a strikeout.) If a pitch is batted foul or fair and a member of the defensive team is able to catch it, before the ball strikes the ground, the batter is declared out. In the event that a bat deflects the ball sharply and directly back toward the catcher's box, it is a foul tip. If a ball ruled as a foul tip is caught, with two strikes in the count, it is considered a counted third strike and an out; if not initially caught by the catcher, it remains a foul ball with two strikes. When three strikes occur on a batter, it is a strikeout and the batter is automatically out unless the pitch is not caught by the catcher or if the pitch bounces before it is caught. It is then ruled an uncaught third strike, an exception to the third strike rule: If the catcher drops the third strike, the batter is permitted to attempt to advance to first base if there are two outs in the inning or if it is unoccupied. In this case, the batter is not out (although the pitcher is awarded a strikeout). The catcher can try to get the batter out by tagging him with the ball or throwing the ball to first base to put him out. (See Doug Eddings (2005 ALCS) and Mickey Owen (1941 World Series) for famous examples of dropped third strikes that dramatically altered the course of post-season series.) On the fourth ball, it is called a walk, and the batter becomes a runner, and is entitled to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a base on balls or a walk (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the batter (or the batter's clothes), the umpire declares a hit by pitch (abbreviated HBP) and the batter is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the batter, or that the batter did not attempt to avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the batter obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the batter awarded first. In addition, if the batter swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the batter and/or the batter's bat as the batter is attempting to hit a pitch, the batter is awarded first base, ruled \\"catcher's interference\\". Baserunning Once a batter becomes a runner and reaches first base safely, he is said to be \\"on\\" that base until he attempts to advance to the next base, until he is put out, or until the half- inning ends. In order to be safe a runner must beat the ball to the bag. When two or more runners are on the basepaths, the runner farther along is called a lead runner or a preceding runner; any other runner is called a trailing runner or a following runner. Runners on second or third base are considered to be in scoring position since ordinary hits, even singles, will often allow them to score. A runner legally touching a base is \\"safe\\"—in most situations he may not be put out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base at any time (except when the ball is dead). A runner that must attempt to advance is forced , when all previous bases are occupied and a batted ball that touches the ground is a fair ball. The runner forced to advance toward the next base is considered \\"forced out\\" if a fielder holding the baseball touches the intended base before the baserunner arrives. When a batted ball is hit in the air, i.e., a fly ball, and caught by the defending team, runners must return and \\"retouch\\" the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. The common name for this requirement is tagging up. If the runner retouches the origin base at any time after the fly ball is first touched by a fielder, he may attempt to advance to the next base or bases at his own risk. The penalty for failing to retouch (if the defensive team notices this) is that the advancing runner can be put out on a live appeal in which the defensive team player with the ball touches the base from which that runner departed prematurely. If a runner tagged up and tries to run to the next base in sequence, they are deemed out if tagged by an infielder at any point before reaching the base or the ball arrives at the base ahead of the runner. However, if the runner is not forced to run to the next base in sequence, they are not deemed out until they are tagged. This often leads to a runner being trapped between two or more infielders trying to tag them before reaching any base: a situation known as being \\"caught in no-man's-land\\". Only one runner may occupy a base at a time; if two runners are touching a base at once, the trailing runner is in jeopardy and will be out if tagged. However, if the trail runner reached the base having been forced there, it is the lead runner who will be out when tagged for failing to reach his force base. Either such occurrence is very rare. Thus, after a play, at most three runners may be on the basepaths, one on each base—first, second, and third. When three runners are on base, this is called bases loaded. Pick-off attempt on runner (in red) at first base Baserunners may attempt to advance, or steal a base, while the pitcher is preparing to make a pitch, while he is making a pitch, or while waiting for a return throw from the catcher after a pitch. The pitcher, in lieu of delivering the pitch, may try to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner; if successful, it is called a pick-off. He may also, as part of a planned sequence, throw a pitch well outside and high of the strike zone to his catcher who is waiting for it upright there, and is thus better prepared to throw out a runner trying to steal; this sequence is called a \\"pitchout.\\" If the runner attempts to steal the next base but is tagged out before reaching it safely, he is caught stealing. An illegal attempt by the pitcher to deceive a runner, among other pitching violations, is called a balk, allowing all runners to advance one base without risk of being put out. Another fundamental tenet of the rules of baseball is that a runner who was initially ruled out can subsequently be ruled safe, but once a runner is ruled safe he cannot be called out on the same play, unless he overruns the base. For example, if a baserunner steals second base, beating the throw, an umpire might make the quick call of safe, but if the runner then slides beyond the base and is tagged before he can retreat to it the umpire has the right to change the call. A runner initially called out can be subsequently ruled safe if the fielder putting the runner out drops the ball (on either a tag or force play), pulls his foot off the base (in the case of a force play), or otherwise illegally obstructs a runner from reaching a base that he otherwise would have reached safely. Batting and base running strategy The goal of each batter is to become a base runner himself (by a base hit, a base on balls, being hit by the pitch, a fielding error, or fielder's choice) or to help move other base runners along (by another base hit, a sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, or hit and run). Batters attempt to \\"read\\" pitchers through pre-game preparation by studying the tendencies of pitchers and by talking to other batters that previously faced the pitcher. While batting, batters attempt to \\"read\\" pitches by looking for clues that the pitcher or catcher reveal. These clues (also referred to as \\"tipping pitches\\") include movements of the pitcher's arms, shoulders, body, etc., or the positioning of the catcher's feet and glove. Batters can attempt to \\"read\\" the spin of a ball early in the pitch to anticipate its trajectory. Batters also remain keenly aware of the count during their at bat. The count is considered to be in the batter's favor when there are more balls than strikes (e.g., two balls and no strikes). This puts pressure on the pitcher to throw a strike to avoid a walk so the batter is more likely to get an easier pitch to hit and can look for a particular pitch in a particular zone or take a riskier or bigger swing. The count is considered to be in the pitcher's favor when there are fewer balls than strikes (e.g., no balls and two strikes). This gives the pitcher more freedom to try enticing the batter to swing at a pitch outside the strike zone or throwing a pitch that is harder to control (e.g. a curve, slider or splitter), but that is also harder to hit. Thus the batter will take a more protective swing. A major strategy in batting at competitive levels of baseball is patient hitting. An example of patient hitting is when a batter has a zero strike count, the batter will almost always look for his perfect pitch. One strike hitting is very similar to no strike hitting and the batter usually is still looking for a good pitch to hit. Two strike hitting, the strategy is changed where the batter will protect the plate by fouling off pitches until the batter is able to find a pitch to hit. This style of hitting allows the hitter to look for a good pitch to hit, and makes the pitcher throw more pitches so that he will tire out faster. This is critical if the batting team is facing a very skilled pitcher who, if allowed to, will take over the game with his ability to get batters to do what he wants them to do. In general, base running is a tactical part of the game requiring good judgment by runners (and their coaches) to assess the risk in attempting to advance. During tag plays, a good slide can affect the outcome of the play. Managers will sometimes simultaneously send a runner and require the batter to swing (a hit- and-run play) in an attempt to advance runners. On a hit-and-run play the batter will often try to hit to the opposite field (the opposite of the natural tendency for the right-handed hitter to pull the ball to left field and vice versa). Hitting to the opposite field will likely find an opening in the infield vacated by the fielder covering second base. This is because coverage of second base against a steal is best achieved by whichever fielder is closer to second base, the shortstop or the second baseman; and such positioning is aimed at defending against the natural tendency of the hitter. Typically, the first and second batters are contact hitters, who try to make contact with the ball to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. The third batter is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, who tries to help baserunners to score runs, and if possible to reach base himself. The fourth batter is the cleanup hitter, and is often a power hitter, who tries to hit home runs. The fifth and sixth batters often help baserunners to score runs. They often \\"sacrifice\\" his at-bat. This can be done by bunting the ball, hitting a fly ball far enough in the air that a baserunner can advance after the catch, or simply making contact with the ball on a hit-and-run play. During the course of play many offensive and defensive players run close to each other, and during tag plays, the defensive player must touch the offensive player. Although baseball is considered a non-contact sport, a runner may be allowed to make potentially dangerous contact with a fielder as part of an attempt to reach base, unless that fielder is fielding a batted ball. (Noted exceptions to the dangerous contact rule are found throughout amateur competitions, including youth leagues, high school, and college baseball.) A good slide is often more advantageous than such contact, and \\"malicious\\" contact by runners is typically prohibited as offensive interference. The most common occurrence of contact of this nature is at home plate between the runner and the catcher, as the catcher is well padded and locked into position that completely blocks home plate from the runner, and the runner will often try to knock the ball out of the catcher's hand by running him over. Since the catcher is seen (symbolically and literally) as the last line of defense, it seems natural that the more physical play happens here. =Innings and determining a winner= An inning consists of each team having one turn in the field and one turn to hit, with the visiting team batting before the home team. A standard game lasts nine innings, although some leagues (such as high school baseball and Little League) play fewer. Most high school games last seven innings, and Little League has six innings. A single game between two teams during NCAA competition is nine innings. A doubleheader in NCAA competition may be two seven inning games, two nine inning games, or one nine inning game and one seven inning game between the same teams. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. If the home team is ahead when the middle of the last inning is reached, it is declared the winner, and the last half-inning is not played. If the home team is trailing or tied in the last scheduled inning (or in an extra inning, see below) and they score to take the lead, the game ends as soon as the winning run touches home plate; however, if the last batter hits a home run to win the game, he and any runners on base are all permitted to score. If both teams have scored the same number of runs at the end of a regular-length game, a tie is avoided by the addition of extra innings. As many innings as necessary are played until one team has the lead at the end of an inning. Thus, the home team always has a chance to respond if the visiting team scores in the top half of the inning; this gives the home team a small tactical advantage. In theory, a baseball game could go on forever; in practice, however, they eventually end. In addition to that rule, a game might theoretically end if both the home and away team were to run out of players to substitute (see Substitutions, below). In Major League Baseball, the longest game played was a 26-inning affair between the Brooklyn Robins and Boston Braves on May 1, 1920. The game, called on account of darkness, ended in a 1–1 tie. Two minor-league teams, the Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings, played a 33-inning game in 1981. In Major League Baseball, games end with tie scores only in rare cases when conditions make it impossible to continue play. A tie game does not count as a game in the standings—a 2008 rule change made all tie games suspended unless and until not needed for the sake of determining playoff teams, and no longer replayed; however, though undecided, and not factored in the championship standings and the playoff reckoning, a tie game goes on the record and player and team statistics from it are counted. Inclement weather may also shorten games, but at least five innings must be played for the game to be considered official; four-and-a-half innings are enough if the home team is ahead. Previously, curfews and the absence of adequate lighting caused more ties and shortened games—now, games interrupted from ending in such circumstances are, at least initially, suspended. Also, with more modern playing surfaces better able to handle light rains, the process for calling or shortening a game due to weather has changed; it is more common than in the past to delay a game as much as two hours before a cancellation; also, a delay usually does not occur anymore until the rain is moderate-to-heavy and/or there is standing water on some part of the playing field. In Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, if the score remains tied after nine innings, up to three extra innings may be played (6 in the playoffs) before the game is called a tie. Since 2011 only regular season games have a 3-hour, 30-minute time limit. Some youth or amateur leagues will end a game early if one team is ahead by ten or more runs, a practice officially known as the \\"runs ahead rule\\" (sometimes referred to as a \\"mercy rule\\" or \\"slaughter rule\\"). Rarely, a game can also be won or lost by forfeit. There is a short break between each half-inning during which the new defensive team takes the field and the pitcher warms up. An existing pitcher is permitted five warm-up pitches and a new pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches. The starting pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches to begin the game. Traditionally, the break between the top half and the bottom half of the seventh inning is known as the seventh-inning stretch. During the \\"stretch\\", fans in the United States often sing the chorus of Take Me Out to the Ball Game. However, since the September 11, 2001 attacks, God Bless America has often been added to it, especially at games in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as during the All-Star Game and the postseason. In Atlanta and Baltimore it has been a tradition since 1974 to play \\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\\" after \\"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\\" during the seventh-inning stretch. At Boston's Fenway Park, a tradition has brought the singing of \\"Sweet Caroline\\" in the middle of the eighth inning. =Substitutions= Each team is allowed to substitute for any player at any time the ball is dead. A batter who replaces another batter is referred to as a pinch hitter; similarly, a pinch runner may be used as a replacement for a baserunner. Any player who replaces another player between innings, or while the team is in the field, is known as a \\"defensive replacement\\". A replacement pitcher is called a relief pitcher. Any replacement is a permanent substitution; the replaced player may not return to the game under any circumstances. Thus, a pitcher that has been removed from the game and replaced by a relief pitcher cannot return to pitch later in the game, and any batter who is replaced by a pinch-hitter cannot take the field in the following inning (or even bat again if his turn comes up again in the same inning). Note however, that two players can switch defensive positions at any time, and both can still stay in the game—because neither has actually been _removed_ from the game. This means that in at least one case, a pitcher switched positions with an outfielder in the middle of the game, with the outfielder becoming a relief pitcher ... then later in the game, the players switched back. This meant that in practical terms, the starting pitcher was relieved by another pitcher, but then came back to relieve the relief pitcher. This game took place on September 28, 1952: the players in question were starting pitcher Harvey Haddix, who moved to the outfield to make way for outfielder-turned relief pitcher Stan Musial, then switched back to pitcher after Musial had faced one batter. Note that this did not violate baseball's permanent substitution rule in any way, as at no time did either player leave the game. This \\"permanent substitution\\" rule is in contrast to some other sports, such as basketball, hockey and American football, that practice \\"free substitution\\". In some cases, if the defensive manager responds to the entrance of a pinch-hitter by bringing in a new pitcher, the pinch-hitter may be replaced by another pinch-hitter without having even come to the plate, in which case the first pinch-hitter is considered to have entered the game and is ineligible to do so later. However, the defensive manager may not replace a pitcher who has not pitched to at least one batter (three batters in MLB as of 2020), except in case of injury. The reentry of a replaced player into the game is a violation of the permanent substitution rule; if the defense has more than nine players on the field at any time, the umpire must determine who is the tenth player, and that player is ejected from the game. Many amateur leagues allow a starting player who was removed to return to the game in the same position in the batting order under a re-entry rule. Youth leagues often allow free and open substitution to encourage player participation. Pitchers as batters, and the designated hitter Pitching is a specialized skill, particularly in the collegiate and professional ranks; so most pitchers are relatively poor hitters, or, those who were skilled batsmen are simply unable to adequately hone their hitting skills to be comparable to everyday position players. As a result, unless keeping a given pitcher in the game is a higher priority than the prospect of immediate offense, it is common to substitute for a pitcher when he is due to bat. This pinch hitter is typically then replaced by a relief pitcher when the team returns to the field on defense. A more complicated tactic is the double switch, in which a pitching change is accompanied by the simultaneous replacement of another fielder. If the pitcher is due to bat soon, and the outgoing fielder batted recently, the new pitcher will take the outgoing fielder's place in the batting order, thus delaying his next time at bat. A common variation on this involves the introduction of a player who has just pinch hit (or pinch run for the pinch hitter) into the defensive alignment; unless this player becomes his team's next pitcher, another field player departs the game, and the new pitcher then assumes that player's place in the batting order. Many leagues allow designated hitters, notably Major League Baseball's American League (which instituted the Designated Hitter in 1973 to boost offensive output). A designated hitter (or DH) is a player whose sole purpose is to hit when it would normally be the pitcher's turn (or, in some leagues, if the pitcher is a good batter, another weaker batter). This is not considered a substitution, but rather a position, albeit a purely offensive one. A designated hitter does not play in the field on defense and may remain in the game regardless of changes in pitchers. If the designated hitter is moved to a fielding position, the team loses the DH, and the fielder whose position was taken by the former DH is replaced by the pitcher, who assumes that player's position in the hitting lineup. The use of the designated hitter, which reduces the need for complicated strategy such as the double-switch, is opposed by many baseball traditionalists. Nevertheless, it is used today at most levels of baseball in the United States and abroad. Major League Baseball's National League is the most prominent league that still requires pitchers to bat. =Rosters= The number of players on a major league roster is dictated by the labor agreements worked out between players and management. According to the current rules, a team may have a maximum of 25 men on a roster from Opening Day until August 31. Beginning in the 2012 season, a major league team is allowed to carry a 26th man on its roster when playing the second game of a double-header that was scheduled at least 48 hours in advance. As of 2020 the number has been increased to 26, of whom no more than 14 may be pitchers, with 27 for a doubleheader. After August 31, during the regular season teams may call up additional personnel to the active roster, up to a maximum of 40 players. This number is seldom actually approached, however, with most teams' September rosters peaking at around 30 players. In 2020 the number was limited to 28. In the postseason, rosters are fixed at 25 men. Until 2007, teams could not replace players on their playoff rosters in the event of an injury and had to play out the series shorthanded. Starting in 2007, an injured player could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by another player who was not included on the initial 25-man roster, but the injured player becomes available for the next round of the playoffs should his team advance. =Pace of play= Rule changes have been implemented at different levels of baseball to quicken the pace of play. In college baseball, the Southeastern Conference experimented with a 20-second pitch clock during the 2010 season, and the NCAA instituted the pitch clock before the 2011 season for when no runners are on base. The pitch clock began to be used in professional baseball as well, first in the Arizona Fall League in 2014 and in the Double-A and Triple-A levels of Minor League baseball in 2015. Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, instituted rule changes to MLB before the start of the 2015 MLB season to address the pace of the game, including having batters remain in the batter's box and the installation of time clocks to limit the time spent around commercial breaks.

After the end of the campaign, it was transferred to the Western Theatre and on the 10 October 1939 was renamed as the Army Group B, and consisted of: * 6th Army * 4th Army = Invasion of the Soviet Union = In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, Army Group North was reformed from Army Group C on 22 June 1941. Army Group North was commanded by Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and staged in East Prussia. Its strategic goal was Leningrad, with operational objectives being the territories of the Baltic republics and securing the northern flank of Army Group Centre in Northern Russia between Western Dvina River and Daugavpils-Kholm Army Group boundary. On commencement of the Wehrmacht's Baltic offensive operation the army group deployed into Lithuania and northern Belorussia. It served mainly in Baltic territories and north Russia until 1944.

Built in 1928 to a Japanese pagoda style design by Edmund B. Clarke, it was voted the most unusual garage in England in 2001. History The garage was built in 1928 to a design by Edmund B. Clarke in the style of a Japanese pagoda on land adjoining Stone Park Farm which was part of the Langley Court Estate. At that time Stone Park Avenue had not been laid out and the main traffic route was north–south between Beckenham and West Wickham; this accounts for the alignment of forecourt. Local folklore suggests that the Langley Court's former owners, the Bucknell family, were shipping magnates that underwrote the Titanic. Subsequently when it sank they financially sank too, hence the sale of their estate. It is further reputed that during their travels, the Bucknells regularly visited the Far East and Japan and brought back many exotic plants for the Estate which is said to have inspired Clarke to build the Garage in its distinctly Japanese style. However, no traces of such planting survive today on the Estate to substantiate this claim. It may well be that the design was purely the whim of the architect and his client. Because of its oriental appearance it became known locally as The Chinese Garage although the official name was Langley Park Garage until 1989. It is now a Grade II listed building. The building is now part of a Kia and Peugeot car dealership and is no longer used as a petrol garage but retains much of its historic character and the grounds and adjoining roundabout are planted in a complementary manner.

Polychrome wood carving by Pedro de Mena, Church of San Miguel and San Julian, Valladolid A cilice , also known as a sackcloth, was originally a garment or undergarment made of coarse cloth or animal hair (a hairshirt) worn close to the skin. It is used by members of various Christian traditions (including some communicants of the Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Scottish Presbyterian Churches) as a self-imposed means of repentance and mortification of the flesh; it is often worn during the Christian penitential season of Lent, especially on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and other Fridays of the Lenten season. Cilices were originally made from sackcloth or coarse animal hair so they would irritate the skin. Other features were added to make cilices more uncomfortable, such as thin wires or twigs. In modern religious circles, cilices are simply any device worn for the same purposes. Etymology The word cilice derives from the Latin cilicium, a covering made of goat's hair from Cilicia, a Roman province in south-east Asia Minor. The reputed first Scriptural use of this exact term is in the Vulgate (Latin) translation of Psalm 35:13, \\"Ego autem, cum mihi molesti essent, induebar cilicio.\\" (\\"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth\\" in the King James Bible). The term is translated as hair-cloth in the Douay–Rheims Bible, and as sackcloth in the King James Bible and Book of Common Prayer. Sackcloth can also mean burlap, but is often mentioned as a symbol of mourning and was probably a form of hairshirt. Use St. Louis at St. Aspais Church, Melun, France Ivan the Terrible's cilice (16th century). The tsar wanted to die like a monk. There is some evidence, based on analyses of both clothing represented in art and preserved skin imprint patterns at Çatalhöyük in Turkey, that the usage of the cilice predates written history. This finding has been mirrored at Göbekli Tepe, another Anatolian site, indicating the widespread manufacturing of cilices. Ian Hodder has argued that \\"self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing 'cleansing' and 'lightness'.\\"Ian Hodder, \\"Çatalhöyük: The Leopard's Tale\\", Thames & Hudson, 2006. In Biblical times, it was the Jewish custom to wear a hairshirt (sackcloth) when mourning (Genesis 37:34, 2 Samuel 3:31, Esther 4:1), but not in order to cause harm to oneself, which is forbidden in the Jewish religion. In the New Testament, John the Baptist wore \\"a garment of camel’s hair\\" (Matthew 3:4). Historically, some Christian denominations have worn sackcloth to mortify the flesh or as penance for adorning oneself. Cilices have been used for centuries in the Catholic Church as a mild form of bodily penance akin to fasting. Thomas Becket was wearing a hairshirt when he was martyred, St. Patrick reputedly wore a cilice, Charlemagne was buried in a hairshirt, and Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, famously wore one in the Walk to Canossa during the Investiture Controversy. Prince Henry the Navigator was found to be wearing a hairshirt at the time of his death in 1460. St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius Loyola and St. Therese of Lisieux are known to have used them. Scottish king James IV wore a cilice during Lent to repent of the indirect role he played in his father's death. In modern times they have been used by Mother Teresa, St. Padre Pio, and Pope Paul VI. In the Discalced Carmelite convent of St. Teresa in Livorno, Italy, members of Opus Dei who are celibate (about 30% of the membership), and the Franciscan Brothers and Sisters of the Immaculate Conception continue an ascetic use of the cilice. According to John Allen, an American Catholic writer, its practice in the Catholic Church is \\"more widespread than many observers imagine\\". Some high church Anglicans, including Edward Bouverie Pusey, wore hairshirts as a part of their spirituality. In the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, influenced by the evangelical revival, penitents were dressed in sackcloth and called in front of the chancel, where they were asked to admit their sins. In some Methodist churches, on Ash Wednesday, communicants, along with receiving ashes, also receive a piece of sackcloth \\"as a reminder of our own sinful ways and need for repentance\\". In popular culture tines In Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code, one of the antagonists, an albino numerary named Silas associated with the religious organization Opus Dei, wears a cilice in the form of a spiked belt around his thigh. The sensationalized depiction in the novel has been criticized for its inaccuracy in subsequent books and by Opus Dei itself, which issued a press release responding to the movie's depiction of the practice, claiming \\"In reality, they cause a fairly low level of discomfort comparable to fasting. There is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person's health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it.\\" See also * Fasting * Hairshirt environmentalism * Hessian * Sackcloth References * External links * *On the Latin word cilicium (with photograph of a 16c hairshirt) *Suffering and Sainthood in the Catholic Church The importance of Penance and Mortification for those who desire to become a Catholic Saint Category:Catholic penitential practices Category:Opus Dei Category:Corporal punishments Category:Catholic religious clothing Category:Undergarments Category:Christian asceticism ","title":"Cilice"},{"id":"895987","text":"Milan Horáček (born 30 October 1946 in Velké Losiny, then in Czechoslovakia), is a Czech-born German politician, a founding member of the German Green Party, a former member of the Bundestag (1983–1985) and a former Member of the European Parliament (2004–2009).

Biography David Park was born in Boston, the son of Mary Turner and Charles Edward Park. His father was a Unitarian minister.Boas, Nancy. “David Park and George Staempfli: A Painter and His Dealer.” Archives of American Art Journal, vol. 54, no. 1, 2015, pp. 46–62.

He attended the Loomis Chaffee school in Windsor Connecticut and was recognized for his early talent by the sculptor Evelyn Longman Batchelder, the headmaster's wife. He moved to Los Angeles at the age of 17, staying with his aunt Edith Park Truesdell who was an artist, so he could study at Otis Art Institute in 1928. A year later, he moved to Berkeley where he married Lydia Newell in 1930 and with whom he had two daughters, Natalie and Helen. His first solo show was in 1933 at the Oakland Art Gallery. In 1943, he began teaching at California School of Fine Arts (CSFA), now known as San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). During the economic depression, Park returned to Boston to teach art at the Winsor School for girls. David Park was one of the post-World War II alumni of the San Francisco Art Institute which was called the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) at the time. He revived an interest in figurative art, at first experimenting with still-abstracted forms that relied on color for their impact, dynamics and warmth. Park, along with Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff, broke away from the philosophy of painting promoted by Clyfford Still, who taught at the Institute, forming what would later be called the Bay Area Figurative Movement. Their influence may be seen in the work of later Bay Area Figurative School artists such as Paul John Wonner, Nathan Oliveira, Manuel Neri, Henry Villierme, Henrietta Berk and Joan Brown. Although these painters started out painting in what was called an objective style, deploying abstract shapes in large space, they soon migrated to using the physical world and representative subjects to experiment with shape, color, texture and temperature in their painting. Park realized that concentrating on principle and abstraction drew attention to the painter rather than the painting. He felt that it was important to focus on the present, to develop responses to nature. \\"I believe that we are living at a time that overemphasizes the need of newness, of furthering concepts\\". Park worked with figurative painting from about 1950 until about 1959 when he became ill with cancer. Usually working from memory,Armstrong 1989, p. 38. he initially painted what he saw: kids playing in the street, musicians, his friends, people in their houses. Toward the end of the decade he painted classical studio nudes and bathers in a monumental style. After he became too ill to work with oils, he continued working with watercolors which he produced until his early death in 1960, at the age of 49, of cancer. Park was working at the University of California as an Associate Professor of Art up until he died. Tragically, he was painting his best works in the final years of his life and career. He had a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, 1988–1989.

It was released on 21 November 1997 in Europe and 24 November 1997 in North America. The game is set on Timber's Island and revolves around Diddy Kong and his friends' attempt to defeat the intergalactic antagonist, a wizarding pig named Wizpig, through winning a series of races. The player can take control of any of the featured characters throughout the game. Diddy Kong Racing features five worlds with four racetracks each, and the ability to drive a car, hovercraft, or pilot an aeroplane. Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2, and was intended to be a real-time strategy game known as Wild Cartoon Kingdom in its early stages. As time progressed, the focus of development shifted from a Walt Disney World- influenced racing game to a unique title named Pro-Am 64, in which Nintendo had no involvement. Due to the delays of Banjo-Kazooie, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to base a game on the character of Diddy Kong. Diddy Kong Racing received critical acclaim upon release. The graphics, audio and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game, with minor criticism directed at the game's repetition. The game has sold 4.8 million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo 64's eighth best-selling game. A sequel named Donkey Kong Racing was in development for the GameCube but was abandoned after Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million in 2002. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS titled Diddy Kong Racing DS was released worldwide in 2007. Gameplay In this screenshot, Timber the Tiger is racing in Fossil Canyon, the 2nd track in the game, in a car. The interface displays the player's current position, number of laps, bananas, time, and a map of the track. In Diddy Kong Racing, players can choose one of ten characters, two of which must be unlocked, who have access to three different vehicles: car, hovercraft and aeroplane. The car is an all-round vehicle, however it is the slowest on surfaces such as sand and water. The hovercraft is designed for both sand and water areas but lacks in acceleration and maneuverability. The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas; it is good at acceleration and maneuvering, however it has the slowest speed. Each racetrack has a set of boosters known as \\"zippers\\" that temporarily boost the player's speed, as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various colours that provide power-ups. There are five different types of balloons: red, blue, green, yellow, and rainbow. Red balloons grant missiles to attack racers ahead, blue balloons grant a speed boost, yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks, green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers, and rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer to the nearest racer. If multiple balloons of the same colour are picked up, the power-up will be upgraded to a more powerful version. A total of two upgrades are available for each balloon. Additionally, racetracks contain non-regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up. A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed but can also be obtained to prevent other players from gaining speed. If a racer gets hit, two bananas will be deducted. In \\"Adventure Mode\\", players control the racer of their choice to progress through the story. Players begin on Timber's Island, which consists of five interconnected worlds; Dino Domain, Snowflake Mountain, Sherbet Island, Dragon Forest, and Future Fun Land. The worlds are opened up by collecting balloons, except for Future Fun Land, which is a hidden world reached by accomplishing several secret objectives. Each world contains four race tracks, an unlockable battle stage and a race against a boss character. If the player defeats Wizpig in Future Fun Land, obtains all amulet pieces and collect all of the gold medals, the player will be able to play in a mode called \\"Adventure 2\\". In this mode, all of the balloons change colour to platinum and the tracks are inverted from left to right. The game also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag-style battle and a mode which involves opponents capturing eggs. The battle modes are not initially selectable, and must be unlocked by collecting keys hidden in each of the worlds.  Plot  Timber the Tiger's parents go on holiday and leave their son in charge of the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to organize a race. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the island's four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bluey the Walrus, Bubbler the Octopus and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercrafts, and aeroplanes. Drumstick the Rooster, the best racer on the island, fails this challenge and is transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic. Timber recruits a team of eight racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Drumstick is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.  Development  Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was conceived as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro-Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars. Due to Banjo-Kazooie being delayed until the summer of 1998, the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video game in time for Christmas 1997. Rare felt that Pro Am 64 did not have a strong enough intellectual property to capture the attention of consumers, and thus changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong. According to Musgrave, the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice, a decision which Nintendo \\"enjoyed\\". Once the intellectual property was changed, the team were left to adapt the visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released. Musgrave stated that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it \\"run as fast\\" as Mario Kart 64, which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilized sprites of characters whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully 3D models. Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall project due to the \\"small team\\" of 14 people who worked on it. In an October 2012 interview, Musgrave stated that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character of Pro Am 64 had the intellectual property for Diddy Kong Racing not been conceived. Two of the characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, starred in games (Banjo-Kazooie and Conker's Bad Fur Day, respectively) which were unveiled to the public before Diddy Kong Racing, at the June 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but ultimately not released until after Diddy Kong Racing. Rare stated that they chose not to exhibit Diddy Kong Racing at E3 because of the proprietary animation technology used in the game. = Soundtrack = The music for the game was composed by David Wise. The soundtrack was first released in Japan on 1 April 1998, with 42 tracks, while a German version of the album was released in Europe with the same number of tracks. For its United States release only 16 tracks were featured. The disc itself was specially shaped in the form of Diddy Kong's head, which was unplayable in certain CD players. Release Due to most of the Nintendo 64's planned 1997 Christmas season lineup being delayed until 1998, Diddy Kong Racing became the main Nintendo 64 release for the holiday shopping season, and a majority of Nintendo's $200 million advertising budget for the entire year was allocated to promoting the game. Diddy Kong Racing also held the distinction of being the only game in the North American Christmas season lineup for which development was contracted by Nintendo; the other two first-party Nintendo 64 games in the lineup, Bomberman 64 and Mischief Makers, were both licensed from Japanese third-party publishers.  Reception  The game received critical acclaim upon release. The Nintendo 64 version holds an aggregate score of 89% at GameRankings based on 20 reviews and 88 at Metacritic based on 15 reviews, whereas the Nintendo DS remake received a score of 67% at GameRankings based on 42 reviews and a score of 63 at Metacritic, based on 39 reviews. Diddy Kong Racing sold approximately 4.5 million copies worldwide; which included 3.78 million copies sold in the United States and PAL regions, and 653,928 copies in Japan. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \\"Gold\\" prize for revenues above €15 million in the European Union during the previous year. It stands as the Nintendo 64's eighth best-selling game, and broke one million units sold in the United States within three weeks of its release. The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game. Some critics noted how it minimized pop-up without resorting to the use of distance fog. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot disputed this, saying that the game has both pop-up and distance fog in amounts comparable to the average Nintendo 64 game. He nonetheless stated that the game was a \\"pleasure to look at\\" and praised the detail of the tracks. Doug Perry of IGN heralded the visuals as the most \\"spectacular of its kind\\", and praised Rare's ability to master dynamic animation through enabling polygons to span larger surfaces without loss of framerate. Furthermore, Perry stated that the game's technical achievements were enough to leave \\"even the most critical Japanese gamer [to] look upon with smiling eyes\\". Although Crispin Boyer opened his review of the game for Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) with the warning \\"Don't dismiss this out-of-the-blue racer as a Mario Kart 64 clone\\", most reviews compared the two games. Gerstmann suspected Nintendo of rushing Diddy Kong Racing to market in order to fill a quarter left vacant by delays of other Nintendo games, and argued it was much too soon after Mario Kart 64s debut to release such a similar game. Other critics, including Boyer's EGM co-reviewers, focused on Diddy Kong Racings perceived superiority to Mario Kart 64. Dan Hsu of EGM said it \\"beats Mario Kart 64 in every department\\", particularly mentioning the superior balance and level designs. Edge praised the adventure and progression aspect of the game, stating that the game's single-player mode is \\"everything Mario Kart 64 should have been.\\" The character designs met with a variety of opinions. EGMs Shawn Smith praised the characters as \\"hilarious\\". Next Generation, by contrast, said the character designs are \\"pathetic and obvious, molded from the same cookie cutter as Banjo-Kazooie and Conker\\", noting the formulaic use of anthropomorphic animal characters and the simplistic application of each animal's characteristics to gameplay. Perry felt that the vocals of characters in the game were \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"comical\\", while also stating that \\"some of the characters are just too damn cute and are certain to annoy older gamers.\\" Overall assessments of the game were mostly positive. GamePro gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for sound and a perfect 5.0 in control, graphics, and fun factor, calling it \\"a feverishly fun Nintendo 64 racer that combines elements of Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, and Pilotwings 64 into one spectacular game.\\" EGM named it \\"Game of the Month\\", with its four reviewers lauding the challenging gameplay and numerous objectives to tackle. Gerstmann instead counted the latter as the game's greatest weakness, arguing that having to repeatedly play through the same courses with slightly different objectives makes the game excessively repetitive. He concluded that the game is far better than Mario Kart 64, but the repetitiveness \\"ultimately kills it.\\" Next Generation fell more in line with the majority, remarking that the combination of racing and adventure elements works well, and that \\"Diddy Kong Racing shows Rare's pure craftmanship, displaying keen subtleties that eventually win players over.\\" In a retrospective review, Andrew Donaldson of Nintendo Life stated that the game was visually \\"incredibly vibrant\\" and \\"captivating\\" for a game of the early Nintendo 64 era. Scott McCall of AllGame acknowledged its only shortcoming was its \\"excessive\\" amount of clipping, although he admitted it was not \\"unbearable\\". He praised the wide range of audio in the game, including its voice acting and soundtrack; he heralded the music as \\"interesting\\" and \\"fitting\\" to its race tracks, also considering it superior to that of Mario Kart 64. Donaldson criticized game's presentation as too \\"cutesy\\", especially in terms of the characters' voices. However, he praised the \\"upbeat\\" and \\"catchy\\" soundtrack, saying that each track had its own unique tune to suit the distinct environment. Diddy Kong Racing won the Console Racing Game of the Year at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 1998, beating Mario Kart 64, Moto Racer and NASCAR 98. Legacy =Sequels= After the release of Diddy Kong Racing, Rare began development on a sequel named Donkey Kong Racing for the GameCube, which featured Donkey Kong as the titular character. A pre-rendered CG video of the game was shown at E3 2001, which displayed a parody of the speederbike scene from Return of the Jedi. According to Lee Musgrave, the game featured a unique mechanic which involved riding on animals rather than driving vehicles, in which the player could switch between different types of animals mid-race; larger animals could destroy obstacles whereas smaller ones allowed more maneuverability. Development of Donkey Kong Racing was cancelled when Nintendo turned down the opportunity to purchase its remaining 51 percent stake in Rare, and the British developer was eventually bought out by Microsoft for $375 million in 2002. After the buyout, Rare took what had been done with Donkey Kong Racing and created a prototype for the Xbox which expanded into an adventure game similar to the original setup of Diddy Kong Racing. Musgrave stated that the concept was essentially \\"built from scratch\\" and featured a limited multiplayer version at one point. The concept was in development over 18 months and evolved from being an animal-orientated racing game to an open- world game with Tamagotchi-style features, in which nurturing animals was a \\"key mechanic\\". By this point, Donkey Kong Racing had evolved into Sabreman Stampede, part of Rare's Sabreman series. Sabreman Stampede was set for release on the Xbox 360, but was cancelled due to a lack of focus and Rare's unfamiliarity with the hardware. Aside from Donkey Kong Racing, two other sequels to Diddy Kong Racing were soon to be developed, one named Diddy Kong Pilot, with planes as the only vehicle, was planned for a release on the Game Boy Advance. Originally announced alongside Donkey Kong Racing at E3 2001, the game eventually became Banjo-Pilot after Microsoft's acquisition of Rare. At the time of its announcement, the game featured the ability to play using a tilt function as well as a D-pad, and contained at least five available tracks. The other titled Diddy Kong Racing Adventure, was a rejected pitch made by Climax Studios for the Nintendo GameCube around 2004. The project was never announced to the public in any capacity and only became known after a video game archivist acquired the prototype and published a video about it in November 2016. =Remake= Diddy Kong Racing DS is a Nintendo DS remake of Diddy Kong Racing. Developed by Rare and published by Nintendo, it was released on 5 February 2007 in North America, and on 20 April 2007 in Europe. This version received enhanced visuals and framerate in addition to touchscreen functions. Four new racetracks were included in the remake, along with new playable characters Taj and Wizpig, while Banjo and Conker were replaced by Tiny Kong and Dixie Kong. The DS version also features new modes which allow the player to create their own racetracks, customize their characters through recording voices and an online multiplayer function. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics asserting that the new additions were \\"gimmicky\\" and the touchscreen controls felt \\"horribly sensitive\\".

The batsman can be also caught out if the ball touches the glove instead of the bat, provided the hand is in contact with the bat. This is because the glove is considered to be the extension of the bat. The batsman may also wear protective helmets, usually with a visor, to protect themselves. Helmets are usually employed when facing fast bowlers. While playing spinners, it might not be employed (though injuries are still possible). Fielders cannot use gloves to field the ball.

Rock Profile first appeared on the channel UK Play in 1999, directed by Michael Cumming, before moving to BBC Two in 2000. The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving Jamie Theakston questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.  Broadcast history  The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In Christmas 2000, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled Rock the Blind. The episode followed Gary Barlow (Lucas) and Ronan Keating (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. Ted Robbins appeared as Pete Waterman, and Sara Cox as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years. In October 2001, several sketches were comprised for the re-launch of Top of the Pops, entitled The All-New Top of the Pops. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. Fans of the series were happy to see its brief return, however, people who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments. Complaints were also sparked regarding the sketch featuring Lucas as Elton John, who was being interviewed about his appearance on TOTP, in which he performed The Lion King's main theme, \\"Circle of Life\\". A member of the audience also verbally harassed Lucas during the sketch, which resulted in the entire feature being cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, meaning the DVD release is the only existent source to the public to view these. In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website Funny or Die for free viewing. The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host Dermot O'Leary. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with Jordan and Peter Andre.  Examples of musicians parodied  * Shirley Bassey (Lucas) and Tom Jones (Walliams) – Shirley Bassey is portrayed as claiming to have more hits than she actually does. Jones is portrayed as a befuddled has-been who confuses the names of other artists who have told him he was \\"the greatest singer of his generation.\\" * ABBA are reluctantly reunited after interviews with Benny Andersson & Björn Ulvaeus. * Boy George (Lucas) and Marilyn (Walliams) – Both characters are portrayed as thinking they are female and Marilyn claims the interviewer has made him pregnant and that he needs to provide for his baby. *Ringo Starr (Walliams) – Ringo Starr is portrayed as believing himself to be Thomas the Tank Engine's representative on Earth. He claims that Thomas has asked him to do both good and bad things. *Simon & Garfunkel – Simon (Lucas) and Garfunkel (Walliams) are portrayed as hating each other, and both try to prove that they are more successful than the other. They use a curtain and even a brick wall to separate themselves. *Bono (Walliams) – Bono is portrayed as an irritating Englishman who loves to phone Salman Rushdie and can't understand why his fellow U2 bandmates persist in speaking with an Irish accent. The Edge (Lucas) points out that it is because they are Irish. *Elton John (Lucas) – Elton John is portrayed as a moody, temperamental prima donna. *George Harrison (Lucas) – George Harrison is portrayed as speaking with a strong Indian accent and keeps a poppadum in his top pocket, yet cannot understand why people keep talking about his Indian influences. He also produces bizarre films plots; for example: one man's love for his sandal. * Lee and H from Steps (Walliams and Lucas respectively) are portrayed as five-year-olds. *Liam Gallagher (Walliams) – Liam Gallagher is portrayed as a foul-mouthed house husband whose wife, Patsy Kensit (Lucas), constantly embarrasses him and ruins his 'hard-man' image by exposing him as a friend of Mary and Jeffrey Archer. *Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees is portrayed as a bully who bosses his brothers Maurice (Lucas) and Robin around. In the episode, Barry resembles the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz. He even has a tail. *Blur – Damon Albarn (Lucas) is portrayed as a Cockney working-class hero, who says his life is like the musical Oliver. Alex James (Walliams) is portrayed as being very confused about many things, such as his sexuality. *Geri Halliwell (Lucas) – Geri Halliwell is portrayed as a patronising moron who stalks and has delusions about marrying George Michael (played by both Lucas and Walliams on separate occasions). According to Geri, everything is \\"Girl Power\\". \\"All base metals, Girl Power. The River Nile, Girl Power. Clive Anderson, dictionary definition of Girl Power\\". *Paul McCartney (Lucas) – Paul McCartney is portrayed as fed up with people asking about his solo career. He announces \\"People keep asking me... what's the hidden message at the end of 'Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time'?... Y'know, 30 years ago I was in a band called The Beatles... but no one ever wants to talk about that!\\" When Theakston, overjoyed at Paul's apparent willingness to talk about the Beatles, questions him on John Lennon, McCartney soberingly muses \\"Y'know the saddest thing? No one ever mentions him.\\" * Dave Stewart (Lucas) – David Stewart of Eurythmics is portrayed as a mad scientist who claims to have created Annie Lennox (Walliams) -- who is portrayed as a creature similar to that from Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' -- from parts of corpses. * Happy Mondays – Bez (Walliams) is portrayed as a professionally trained dancer who went to the Ramhurst School, claiming that he was in the year above Darcey Bussell. Shaun Ryder (Lucas) is portrayed as mumbling, incoherent and an unenthusiastic interviewee. * Gary Barlow (Lucas) and Howard Donald (Walliams) from boy band Take That – Gary Barlow and Howard Donald are portrayed as constantly thinking about reforming the band. Gary is portrayed as a mean-spirited bully and Howard portrayed as childlike. When Theakston asks Gary if he still speaks to Robbie Williams, Gary responds \\"Yeah, I phone Robbie up every week -- don't tell him it's me though\\". * Graham Coxon (Walliams) – Graham Coxon (of Blur) is portrayed as a musically inept, paranoid pyromaniac who speaks in hushed tones until he categorically states he didn't \\"start the fire\\". * Andy Warhol (Lucas) – Andy Warhol is portrayed as living in a flat with Lou Reed (Williams). This sketch was the direct influence for Lou and Andy in Little Britain, only Lucas looks like Andy Warhol and isn't in a wheelchair. They do however both use the same voices as Lou and Andy. Reed asks Warhol what he wants for his tea, to which Warhol replies \\"chippy\\". Reed then goes into a long explanation about how he had chippy for his lunch and can't have it twice. Warhol replies \\"Yeah, I know\\", and a catchphrase was born. \\"So what do you want then?\\", to which Warhol replies: \\"Chippy\\". * Kylie Minogue (Walliams) and her sister Dannii Minogue (Lucas) – The sisters are portrayed as being extremely jealous of each other and during their interview take great pride in pointing out each other's failures. Dannii tells Kylie, \\"the whole family was so proud when your last single went to number 27 in the charts\\". * Prince (Lucas) – Prince is portrayed as an alcoholic Glaswegian tramp, performing his hits on acoustic guitar and harmonica as a busker. Although the introduction to the episode claims he is living in Glasgow, he is busking on the Uxbridge Road in London's Shepherd's Bush.  Reception  Rock Profile has been well received by critics. Radio Times described the show as \\"truly silly and truly inspired\\". Sunday Mirror described it as \\"excellent comedy\\".  DVD release  A DVD release of Rock Profile was released in 2005, featuring both series, Rock the Blind, the TOTP sketches, as well as a never-before seen commercial and sketches composed for The Ralf Little Show.

This is covered by Law 25 of the Laws of Cricket. When a runner is used, the batsman stands in position and plays shots as normal, but does not attempt to run between the wickets: the runner runs for him/her. The runner occupies the injured batsman's crease when he/she is on strike, but takes up a position away from the pitch at the umpire's discretion, typically on a pitch parallel to that being used for the game. When the injured batsman moves off strike, he/she then takes up the position near the square leg umpire (not at the bowler's end), and the runner stands next to the bowler's wicket as in the normal course of play. *A runner can only be used if the umpires, together, are satisfied that the batsman has sustained an injury during the match that affects his/her ability to run. *The runner must be a member of the batting side, but not the twelfth man. The runner must also already have batted in the innings, if possible. *The runner must wear all the external protective equipment worn by the batsman and must carry a bat. If either the injured batsman or his/her runner is out of their ground, the batsman is liable to be run out or stumped. The runner is also subject to other laws such as obstructing the field.

He was the son of Yngvi, and he had reclaimed the throne of Sweden for his dynasty from Haki (the brother of Hagbard, the hero of the legend of Hagbard and Signy, and Snorri cites two kennings from this legend Sigar's steed and Hagard's fell noose, when telling of Jorund). Snorri Sturluson relates that when Jorund was young he used to travel the seas and plunder with his brother Erik, and they were great warriors. One summer they plundered in Denmark where they met another pillager, King Gudlög of Hålogaland (a province in Norway) with whom they fought. They took him prisoner and carried him ashore at Stromones where they hanged him. Gudlaug's surviving companions raised a mound over him there. Snorri then cites the poem Háleygjatal by a Norwegian skald named Eyvindr skáldaspillir: {  :En Guðlaugr :grimman tamdi :við ofrkapp :austrkonunga :Sigars jó, :er synir Yngva :menglötuð :við meið reiddu. :Og náreiðr :á nesi drúpir :vingameiðr, :þar er víkur deilir, :þar er fjölkunnt :um fylkis hreyr :steini merkt, :Straumeyjarnes.Ynglinga saga at Norrøne Tekster og Kvad  :By the fierce East-kings' cruel pride, :Gudlog must on the wild horse ride -- :The wildest horse you e'er did see: :'Tis Sigur's steedthe gallows tree. :At Stromones the tree did grow, :Where Gudlog's corpse waves on the bough. :A high stone stands on Stromo's heath, :To tell the gallant hero's death.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr  } This act rendered the Swedish princes, Eric and Jorund, even more famous and they were thought of as even greater men. When they learnt that King Haki no longer had his forces around him, they decided to take care of their enemy. They assembled a large force that was joined by Swedes as they approached. They entered Mälaren (a bay at the time) and steered towards Uppsala. They left their ships at the Fyris Wolds and were met by Haki who had fewer men. Haki was a brutal fighter and managed to turn the tide of the battle. He slew Erik who held the banner and Jorund retreated with his men. Haki had been seriously wounded and died. Jorund then ruled Sweden at Uppsala, but he usually spent the summers pillaging. One summer, he plundered in Jutland and entered Limfjorden, where he continued the pillaging. They anchored in Oddesund (before a storm in 1825, it was near the innermost part of the fjord and almost 200 km from its mouth) but were discovered by the Norwegian pirate Gylaug of Hålogaland, the son of Gudlaug. Gylaug and his men attacked them and were joined by local forces who wanted revenge. As Jorund was vastly outnumbered (and had to run an almost 200 km long gauntlet to get out of the fjord), he lost the battle, and Gylaug had him hanged. Snorri illustrates this event with the stanza from Ynglingatal: {  :Varð Jörundr :hinn er endr of dó, :lífs of lattr :í Limafirði, :þá er hábrjóstr :hörva Sleipnir :bana Goðlaugs :of bera skyldi; :ok Hagbarðs :hersa valdi :höðnu leif :at halsi gekk.A second online presentation of Ynglingatal  :Jorund has travelled far and wide, :But the same horse he must bestride :On which he made brave Gudlog ride. :He too must for a necklace wear :Hagbert's fell noose in middle air. :The army leader thus must ride :On Horva's horse, at Lymfjord's side.  } The Historia Norwegiæ presents a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, older than Snorri's quotation, continuing after Yngvi (called Ingialdr): {  Post hunc filius ejus Jorundr, qui cum Danos debellasset, ab eisdem suspensus in loco Oddasund in sinu quodam Daciæ, quem Limafiorth indiginæ appellant, male vitam finivit.

The daughter gave birth to Halfdan, but another woman became Fróði's legitimate wife and gave him an heir named Ingjaldr (corresponds to the Heaðobard Ingeld in Beowulf). Together with one of his earls, Swerting, Jorund conspired against Fróði and killed him during the blót.

The Swedish king Hugleik had also gathered a large army and was supported by the two champions Svipdag and Geigad. On the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds), south of Uppsala, there was a great battle in which the Swedish army was defeated. Haki and his men captured the Swedish champions Svipdag and Geigad and then they attacked the 'shield-circle' around the Swedish king and slew him and his two sons. Haki and his warriors subdued the Swedish provinces and Haki made himself the king of Sweden. Then he happily sat in peace for three years while his warriors travelled far and wide and amassed fortunes. The previous king, Hugleik, had two cousins named Eric and Jorund, who had become famous by killing Gudlög, the king of Hålogaland. When they learnt that king Haki's champions were gone plundering, they assembled a large force and steered towards Sweden. They were joined by many Swedes who wanted to reinstall the Yngling dynasty on the Swedish throne. The two brothers entered Mälaren, went towards Uppsala, and landed on the Fyrisvellir. There they were met by king Haki, who had a considerably smaller force. Haki was, however, a brutal enemy who killed many men and lastly Eric, who held the banner of the two brothers. Jorund and his men fled to the ships, but Haki was mortally wounded. Haki asked for a longship, which was loaded with his dead warriors and their weapons. He had the sails hoisted and set fire to a piece of tar- wood, which he asked to be covered with a pile of wood. Haki was all but dead when he was laid on top of the pile. The wind was blowing towards the water and the ship departed in full flame between the small islands out into the sea. This was much talked about and it gave him great fame. Other traditions Most legends surrounding Haki are probably lost. In the Völsunga saga, Gudrun and Brynhild have a discussion on the \\"greatest of men\\" referring to a legend now lost, where Haki's sons have not yet avenged their sisters by killing the evil Sigar (the feud with Sigar is still going on and Hagbard has not yet been hanged): In Gesta Danorum (book 7), Haki (Hakon) killed Sigar, avenging his brother Hagbard's death. In Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus gives Haki as a king of Denmark, and Hugleik, called Huglet(h)us, is an Irish king. The motivation behind the attack was to show that even the furthest kingdoms of the world might not be untouched by the Danish arms. Saxo writes that Starkad and Haki brought their fleet to Ireland, where the rich and greedy king Hugleik lived. Hugleik was never generous to an honourable man, but spent all his riches on mimes and jugglers. In spite of his avarice, Hugleik had the great champions Geigad and Svipdag. When the battle began, the jugglers and mimes panicked and fled, and only Geigad and Svipdag remained to defend Hugleik, but they fought like an entire army. Geigad dealt Starkad a wound on the head which was so severe that Starkad would later sing songs about it. Starkad killed Hugleik and made the Irish flee. He then had the jugglers and mimes whipped and beaten, in order to humiliate them. Then the Danes brought Hugleik's riches out to Dublin to be publicly looted, and there was so much of it that none cared for its strict division. When Haki learnt that his brother Hagbard had been killed by Sigar, he avenged his brother. However, killing Sigar was not enough to satiate his thirst for blood: He was soon chased away by Sigar's son Siwald. Secondary sources Nerman, B. Det svenska rikets uppkomst. Stockholm, 1925.

The team with the most runs wins in many versions of the game, and always draws at worst (see result), except for some results decided by the DLS method, which is used in limited overs games where the two teams have had different opportunities to score runs. One run (known as a \\"single\\") is scored when: * A batsman (known as the \\"striker\\") hits the ball with the bat (or a gloved hand holding the bat) * Both the striker and the non-striker, who start off positioned at opposite ends of the pitch (which has a length of 22 yards), arrive safely at the other end of the pitch (i.e. they cross each other without being run out). There is no limit on the number of runs that may be scored off of a single hit and depending on how long it takes the fielding team to recover the ball, the batsmen may run more than once. Each completed run increments the scores of both the team and the striker. A batsman may also score 4 or 6 runs (without having to run) by striking the ball to the boundary. * If the ball hits the ground before hitting or passing the boundary, then four runs are scored. * If the ball passes or hits the boundary without first bouncing, then six runs are scored. The team's total score in the innings is the aggregate of all its batsmen's individual scores plus any extras (which are runs scored without the bat or glove hitting the ball). To complete a run, both batsmen must make their ground, with some part of their person or bat touching the ground behind the popping crease at the other end of the pitch. Attempting a run carries a risk factor because either batsman can be run out, (one method of dismissal), if the fielding side can break the wicket with the ball before the batsman has completed the run. Method Scoring runs is the subject of Law 18 in the Laws of Cricket. Boundaries are covered in Law 19. How the Batsman makes his ground is Law 30. =Runs scored by running= Harmanpreet Kaur taking a run while batting for Sydney Thunder, 2018. Batsmen frequently run singles and also \\"twos\\" and \\"threes\\". If the batsmen run a single or a three, they have \\"changed ends\\", so the striking batsman becomes the non-striker for the next delivery, and vice versa. If the single or three is scored off the last delivery of the over, the striker, having changed ends, retains the strike for the first delivery of the next over. There are rare instances of \\"fours\\" being all run when the ball does not reach the boundary. A \\"five\\" is possible, but usually arises from a mistake by the fielders, such as an overthrow. The batsman is never compelled to run and can deliberately play without attempting to score. This is known as running between the wickets. The batsmen stop running when they judge that the ball is sufficiently controlled by the fielding team to prevent another run, for example when it is returned to the bowler or the wicketkeeper. If, when turning for an additional run, one of the batsmen fails to ground some part of their body or bat behind the popping crease, the umpire declares a \\"short run\\" and the run does not count but, even if the bat is dropped, runs do count as long as each batsman makes his ground with his bat or person somehow. =Boundaries= The act of running is unnecessary if the batsman hits the ball to the marked boundary of the field. If the ball reaches the boundary having made contact with the ground, four runs are added to the scores of both the batsman and the team. If the batsman succeeds in hitting the ball onto or over the boundary on the full (i.e. the ball does not contact the ground until it has hit or is beyond the boundary), six runs are added. If the batsmen are running when the ball reaches the boundary, they can stop, and their team will be awarded either the number of runs for the boundary (4 or 6), or runs the batsmen completed together (including a run in progress if they already crossed when the boundary is scored), whichever is greater. =Extras= In addition to runs scored by the batsmen, the team total is incremented by extras (also known as \\"sundries\\" in Australia; they are not added to a batsman's individual score), which arise because: * The bowler has delivered a wide or no-ball * The fielders have caused a no-ball (each of which incurs a one-run penalty) * The fielders have failed to control a ball which did not make contact with the bat (byes and leg byes), thus allowing the batsmen to run. * Byes, leg-byes and wides that elude the fielders and cross the boundary score four (never six) in addition to the one-run penalty scored for a no-ball or wide if applicable. * Five penalty runs are awarded by the umpires, either to the batting team or to the fielding team as applicable, for infringement of some of the Laws, usually relating to unfair play or player conduct. ** For example five runs are awarded to the batting team if the ball hits a helmet on the ground belonging to the fielding team; five runs are awarded to the fielding team if the batting team causes avoidable damage to the wicket after due warning by the umpire. If the umpire considers a short run to have been a deliberate act he will disallow all runs attempted, and impose a five-run penalty on the batting team. History In the written records of cricket, \\"run\\" is as old as \\"cricket\\" itself. In the earliest known reference to the sport, dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date), Surrey coroner John Derrick made a legal deposition concerning a plot of land in Guildford that when ():Underdown, p. 3. > \\"a scholler of the Ffree Schoole of Guildeford, hee and diverse of his > fellowes did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies\\". It may well be that, in this context, \\"runne\\" meant running in general. For a long time, until well into the 18th century, the scorers sat on the field and increments to the score were known as \\"notches\\" because they would notch the scores on a stick, with a deeper knick at 20. The same method was used by shepherds when counting sheep. In the earliest known Laws of cricket, dated 1744, one of the rules states:Ashley-Cooper, p. 22. > \\"If in running a Notch, the Wicket is struck down by a Throw, before his > Foot, Hand, or Bat is over the Popping-Crease, or a Stump hit by the Ball, > though the Bail was down, it's out\\". In the 1774 version, the equivalent rule states:Haygarth, pp. 16–17. > \\"Or if in running a notch, the wicket is struck down by a throw, or with the > ball in hand, before his foot, hand, or bat is grounded over the popping- > crease; but if the bail is off, a stump must be struck out of the ground by > the ball\\". These are the earliest known references to running as the means of scoring. The change of terminology from \\"notch\\" to \\"run\\" was gradual and both terms were in use in 1800. The result of a match played in Sussex on 3 August 1800 was a win \\"by 25 notches\\"McCann, p. 197. while another match in Sussex on 9 August 1800 was won \\"by an innings and 38 runs\\".McCann, p. 198.

The affair started in June 1953 in Gaspésie when three men from Pennsylvania were reported missing. Their bodies were found a month later deep in the woods sixty kilometres from the nearest town. Trial and execution The main suspect in the case was Wilbert Coffin, who was found to have many items belonging to the men in his possession. Coffin was sent to trial in July 1954 and though the evidence against him was mostly circumstantial, he was convicted with one count of murder (as the penal code prohibited multiple convictions of murder in the same trial). On August 5 he was sentenced to hang. An appeal to the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench was dismissed. Coffin's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was turned down but the federal Cabinet submitted a reference question to that Court asking: \\"If the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be made by the court?\\"Reference re Same- Sex Marriage , [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, 2004 SCC 79, at para. 68 The federal government's decision to take the question to the Supreme Court of Canada caused tension with the government of the province of Quebec. The Supreme Court answered that it would have upheld the conviction of Coffin: Reference re Regina v. Coffin, [1956] S.C.R. 191. Coffin was hanged at Montreal's Bordeaux Prison on February 10, 1956 at 12:01 AM. But the story did not end with Coffin's death. Jacques Hébert, a reporter during the trial and later a senator, published two books on the matter: (1958) and J'accuse les assassins de Coffin (1963). Hébert's 1963 book caused such controversy that the provincial government established a Commission of Inquiry into the case. Headed by judge Roger Brossard with Jules Deschênes as Counsel to the Commission, over 200 witnesses were interviewed. The commission found that Coffin did receive a fair trial. In 1979, filmmaker Jean-Claude Labrecque made a feature film on the matter entitled . It was released on September 10, 1980. Other documents inspired by the Coffin case include Dale Boyle's song \\"The Wilbert Coffin Story\\" and the Alton Price book, To Build A Noose, which reflects Price's intensive research on the case. Recent interest and debate In 2006, 50 years after Coffin's hanging, four generations of his family commemorated his death at his graveside. That week, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted announced it was studying the case. The director of client services for the association called Coffin's case \\"a blot on the criminal justice system.\\" The coroner at the time, Lionel Rioux, recently told the news media that he believes Coffin was innocent. Rioux accused Maurice Duplessis, premier of Quebec at the time, of making Coffin into a scapegoat for the killings of foreign tourists. Rioux held a coroner's inquest at which Coffin testified. Rioux says that the provincial government destroyed the transcript of Coffin's testimony. Coffin did not testify at his trial. Speaking in 2006, prominent Canadian criminal lawyer Edward Greenspan blamed Coffin's trial lawyer, Raymond Maher, for keeping Coffin out of the witness box: \\"It was incompetence with a capital I,\\" Greenspan said of Maher. \\"It's the worst case of lawyering I've ever seen.\\" At the time Coffin was hanged, he had an 8-year-old son. The child's mother wanted to marry Coffin before the execution, but Duplessis denied permission and said it would not be \\"decent.\\" In a 384-page book titled ' (translation: The Coffin Affair: A Hoax?) published by Wilson & Lafleur in Montreal, Clément Fortin, a retired attorney and law professor, proceeded to re-establish the facts. Given the evidence presented to the Percé jurors in 1954, Fortin concluded that they were justified to render a verdict of guilty as charged. In 1964, the Royal Commission of Enquiry on the Coffin Affair reached the same conclusion.

He was the son of Alf and Bera. Some commentators assimilate Hugleik with his namesake, the Geatish king Hygelac. However, although both kings were killed in battle, Chlochilaicus/Hygelac was killed near the coast of France/Frisia, while Hugleik was killed at Fyrisvellir in Sweden. When Hugleik's father and uncle had killed each other, Hugleik inherited the Swedish throne. Like his father, he was not a warrior, but preferred to stay at home. He was reputed to be as greedy as he was rich and, he preferred to be in the company of jesters, seidmen and völvas who entertained him. Haki and Hagbard (the hero of the legend of Hagbard and Signy) were two famous sea-kings who had amassed a great force of warriors, and they occasionally plundered together. Haki arrived in Sweden with his troops to assault Uppsala. Haki was a murderous fighter and around himself he had his twelve hirdmen of whom one was the legendary old warrior Starkad (who had been in the service of Hugleik's grandfather Erik and great-uncle Alrik). Hugleik had also mustered a large army and he was aided by two famous warriors named Svipdag and Geigad. The two armies met on the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds) and a great battle ensued. The Swedish army was defeated, but the two champions Svipdag and Geigad pushed onwards even though Haki's champions were six times as many. They were both captured by Haki, and then Haki attacked the shield-circle around Hugleik and killed him together with both his sons. Saxo Grammaticus knows of this story but he renders Huglet(h)us as an Irish king who was killed by the Dane Haco (given as Hakon in the following translation ). The motivation behind describing Hugleik as an Irish king was probably identical to what Saxo described as the motivation behind the attack: even the farthest kingdoms of the world might not be untouched by the Danish arms. Saxo writes that Starkad and Haki brought their fleet to Ireland where lived the rich and greedy king Hugleik. Hugleik was never generous to an honourable man, but spent all his riches on mimes and jugglers. In spite of his avarice, Hugleik had the great champions Geigad and Svipdag.

Some versions indicate they were brothers or other close relations. They killed each other. History According to Ynglingatal, Historia Norwegiae and Ynglinga saga, Yngvi and Alf were the sons of Alrik. Snorri Sturluson relates that Yngvi was an accomplished king: a great warrior who always won his battles, the master of all exercises, generous, happy and sociable. He was both loved and famous. Alf was unsociable and harsh and stayed at home instead of pillaging in other countries. His mother was Dageid, the daughter of king Dag the Great from whom is descended the Dagling family. Alf was married to Bera who was happy and alert and a very lovable woman. One day in the autumn, Yngvi returned to Uppsala from a very successful Viking expedition which had rendered him famous. He used to spend time at the drinking table until late in the night, like Bera, and they found it pleasant to talk to each other. Alf, however, preferred to go to bed early and he started to tell her to go to bed early as well so that she did not wake him. Then Bera used to answer that Yngvi was much better for a woman than Alf, an answer that was getting on Alf's nerves. One evening, the jealous Alf entered the hall and saw Yngvi and Bera converse on the high seat. Yngvi had a short sword in his lap and the other guests were too drunk to see that Alf had arrived. From under his cloak Alf drew a sword and pierced Yngvi. Yngvi, mortally wounded, got up, drew his own short sword and slew Alf. They were buried in two mounds on the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds). Alf was succeeded by his son Hugleik.

But King Alrek had a short life, for Eirík struck Alrek dead with a bridle when they were out to train their horses and then ruled as sole ruler over Sweden. This version says that Eirík reigned for a long time as told in Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar (Saga of Hrólf son of Gautrek). This second saga introduces Thornbjörg, the daughter of King Eirík and Queen Ingigerd, who was a skillful shieldmaiden and ruled over part of the kingdom. Thornbjörg even called herself King Thorberg. But eventually she fell in love with Hrólf son of Gautrek and agreed to marry him, at which point she gave up her weapons to her father King Eirík and took up embroidery. In Gesta Danorum Saxo Grammaticus in Book 5 of his Gesta Danorum introduces Ericus Desertus, that is Erik the Eloquent, son of a champion named Regnerus (Ragnar), both Norwegians in the service of King Gøtarus (Götar) of Norway, a monarch otherwise unknown. This Erik is likely to be the Eirík the Eloquent or Eiríkr the Wise in Speech mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in the Skáldskaparmál as being of Ylfing lineage. But he otherwise has left no clear record in surviving Norse literature. Saxo makes up for it by telling at greath length of Erik's amusing deeds. He relates how Erik outwitted all foes with clever tricks and became the counselor of Fróði son of Fridleif, king of Denmark. Erik's expeditions on Fróði's behalf always went well because of Erik's cunning and way with words. Erik finally married Fróði's sister Gunvara and Erik's elder half-brother Rollerus (Roller) was made king of Norway. Saxo then brings in a king of the Swedes named Alricus (Alrik) who corresponds to Alrek of the Norse tradition. Alrik was at war with Gestiblindus king of the Gautar (Geats) and Gestiblindus now sought Fróði's aid. (In the Norse Hervarar saga Gestumblindi is the name assumed by the disguised Odin and it is possible that this Gestiblindus is also Odin in disguise.) Erik and Skalk the Scanian pursued the war and slew Alrik's son Gunthiovus (Old Norse Gunnþjófr) leader of the men of Vermland and Solongs. Then occurred a parley and secret interview between Alrik and Erik in which Alrik attempted to win Erik over to his cause. When this failed, Alrik asked that the war be settled by a single combat between himself and Gestiblindus. Erik refused the offer because of Gestiblind's unfitness and advanced years but made a counter-offer to fight such a duel with Alrik himself if Alrik were willing. The fight occurred straightaway. Alrik was slain and Erik seemed to be fatally wounded so that a report actually came to King Fróði that Erik was dead. Indeed Erik was long in recovering. However Fróði was disabused when Erik himself returned announcing that Fróði was now also king of Sweden, Värmland, Helsingland, and Soleyar. Fróði then gave all those lands to Erik to rule directly and also gave Erik the two Laplands, Finland, and Estonia as dependencies paying annual tribute. Saxo explains that this Erik was the first Swedish king to be called Erik but that after him it became a very common name among the Swedish kings. He also writes that Erik met and helped the champion Arngrim, an account that agrees with Hervarar saga, where Arngrim's sons meet Erik's successor Yngvi (see e.g. Angantyr and Hjalmar). That the duel occurred at the end of a \\"secret interview\\" suggests that Alrik and Erik were alone when they fought just as were their counterparts in the Norse accounts. That Erik was believed to have died suggests knowledge of the Ynglinga saga version in which both fighters met their death. There is no mention of horse bridles. But Erik is not elsewhere a great duelist or champion but instead a trickster who wins through stratagems and deceiving words so that is it likely that Saxo or his source passed over a stratagem in which a horse bridle played a part. Saxo also mentions Starkad's stay in Sweden in Book 6 in a summary of Starkad's life up to that point in his history. But Saxo does not indicate what king or kings then ruled Sweden, saying only: > ... he went into the land of the Swedes, where he lived at leisure for seven > years' space with the sons of Frø. Frø is of course the god Frey, the ancestor of the Swedish dynasty. At the beginning of Book 6, Saxo notes that Erik died of a disease and was succeeded by his son Haldanus (Halfdan). Halfdan was later slain by rivals for the throne but the warrior Starkad established Halfdans' heir Siward as the new king. Siward's daughter Signe was married to King Harald of Denmark who was co-king his brother Fróði. Later Harald's son Halfdan, now king of Denmark, slew Siward in war. But Siward's grandson Erik, the son of Halfdan's uncle Fróði by Signe, the direct heir to the throne, now rose up against Halfdan. After a long war this second Erik was captured by Haldfan and left in the woods in chains to be devoured by beasts. With him, it seems, the Swedish line of Erik the Eloquent, as set forth by Saxo, came to an end. Commentary It is not clear whether or not the accounts in the Gesta Danorum and the accounts in the Ynglinga saga' tales of a Danish king named Halfdan who became king of Sweden are at all related. See Halfdan. Traditions of twin brothers connected with horses appear are a commonplace in Indo-European cultures as are foundation legends about two twin brothers, one of whom kills the other. It is possible that Alrek and Eirik are reflexes of such traditions. Saxo's identification of the legendary Eirík the Eloquent with the legendary Swedish king Eirík probably originated as a flourish by a pro-Danish or pro-Norwegian story teller.

(, ; from terre, \\"land\\") is a French term used to describe the environmental factors that affect a crop's phenotype, including unique environment contexts, farming practices and a crop's specific growth habitat. Collectively, these contextual characteristics are said to have a character; terroir also refers to this character. Some artisanal crops for which terroir is studied include wine, coffee, tobacco, chocolate, chili peppers, hops, agave (for making tequila and mezcal), tomatoes, heritage wheat, maple syrup, tea, and cannabis. Terroir is the basis of the French wine appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, which is a model for wine appellation and regulation in France and around the world. The AOC system presumes that the land from which the grapes are grown imparts a unique quality that is specific to that growing site (the plants' habitat). The extent of terroir's significance is debated in the wine industry. Origins Over the centuries, French winemakers developed the concept of terroir by observing the differences in wines from different regions, vineyards, or even different sections of the same vineyard. The French began to crystallize the concept of terroir as a way of describing the unique aspects of a place that influence and shape the wine made from it. Long before the French, the wine-making regions of the ancient world had already developed a concept of different regions having the potential to produce very different and distinct wines, even from the same grapes. The Ancient Greeks would stamp amphorae with the seal of the region they came from, and soon different regions established reputations based on the quality of their wines. For centuries, literate and disciplined members of the Benedictine and Cistercian orders cultivated grapes in much of Burgundy. With vast landholdings, the monks could conduct large-scale observation of the influences that various parcels of land had on the wine it produced. Some legends have the monks going as far as \\"tasting\\" the soil. Over time the monks compiled their observations and began to establish the boundaries of different terroirs - many of which still exist today as the Grand Cru vineyards of Burgundy. Elements Chablis premier cru Fourchaume are terroir-driven. While wine experts disagree about the exact definition, particular consideration is given to the natural elements that are beyond the control of humans. Mark A. Matthews, a professor of viticulture and plant physiology at University of California, Davis, has described the common conception of terroir as a myth. While Matthews agrees local characteristics can have an effect on plant growth and the wines made from particular grapes, he points out that the term is imprecisely defined, and puts forward that the concept of terroir is accepted primarily based on traditional belief, and is not backed by rigorous data or research.Mark A Matthews (2016). Terroir and Other Myths of Winegrowing. University of California Press, Components often described as aspects of terroir include: * Climate * Soil type * Geomorphology * Other organisms growing in, on, and around the vine plots The interaction of climate and terroir is generally broken down from the macroclimate of a larger area (For example, the Côte de Nuits region of Burgundy), down to the mesoclimate of a smaller subsection of that region (such as the village of Vosne-Romanée) and even to the individual microclimate of a particular vineyard or row of grapevines (like the Grand Cru vineyard of La Grande Rue). The element of soil relates both to the composition and the intrinsic nature of the vineyard soils, such as fertility, drainage and ability to retain heat. Geomorphology refers to natural landscape features like mountains, valleys and bodies of water, which affect how the climate interacts with the region, and includes the elements of aspect and elevation of the vineyard location. Other organisms growing in, on, and around the vine plots refers to the region specific fauna, flora, and microflora present in the vineyards. The microbial populations in vineyards have been described as being a quantifiable aspect of the overall terroir. =Human controlled elements= The definition of terroir can be expanded to include elements that are controlled or influenced by humans. This can include the decision of which grape variety to plant, though whether or not that grape variety will produce quality wine is an innate element of terroir that may be beyond human influence. Some grape varieties thrive better in certain areas than in others. The winemaking decision of using wild or ambient yeast in fermentation instead of cultured or laboratory produced yeast can be a reflection of terroir. The use of oak is a controversial element since some will advocate that its use is beneficial in bringing out the natural terroir characteristics while others will argue that its use can mask the influences of the terroir. Vineyard management (e.g. growing grapes organically or biodynamically over a more conventional method of farming) can also be seen as a human controlled aspect of terroir. Influences of viticulture and winemaking Many decisions during the growing and winemaking process can either lessen or increase the expression of terroir in the wine. These include decisions about pruning, irrigation and selecting time of harvest. At the winery, the use of oak, cultured or ambient yeast, length of maceration and time in contact with lees, temperature during fermentation, and processes like micro-oxygenation, chaptalization, clarification with fining agents, and reverse osmosis all have the potential to either reduce or emphasize some aspect derived from the terroir. Winemakers can work between the extremes of producing wine that is terroir-driven and focused on purely expressing the unique aspects of a region's terroir, or winemaking that is done without any consideration given to terroir. Furthermore, aspects of terroir such as climate and soil type may be considered when deciding such things as which grape variety to plant if the goal is to make good wine rather than terroir-driven wine. The importance of these influences depends on the culture of a particular wine region. In France, particularly Burgundy, there is the belief that the role of a winemaker is to bring out the expression of a wine's terroir. The French word for \\"winemaker,\\" vigneron, is more aptly translated as \\"wine-grower\\" rather than \\"winemaker\\". The belief that the terroir is the dominant influence in the wine is the basis behind French wine labels emphasizing the region, vineyard, or AOC more prominently than the varietal of grape, and often more prominently than the producer. In other drinks The concept of terroir exists in other drinks, notably in tea (Wuyi rock-essence tea being a notable example) and Cognac where the chalky soil, climate and distance from the ocean are all factors influencing the product. Producers of whiskey, bourbon, rum, and vodka use terroir elements in their production process, including wood flavors derived from barrel aging. In artisan cheese The tenet of terroir has also been applied to the production of artisan cheese, and French authorities have fought to balance traditional cheesemakers terroir cheeses concerns with those of major industrialists. Appellation systems The influence of terroir means that wines from a particular region are unique, incapable of being reproduced outside that area, even if the grape variety and winemaking techniques are painstakingly duplicated. Winemakers in Burgundy do not believe that they are producing Pinot noir that happens to be grown in Burgundy, but that they are producing unique Burgundian wines that happen to be made from Pinot noir. Appellation systems, such as the French AOC systems, have developed around the concepts of \\"unique wines from a unique area\\". These systems have also developed into protected designation of origin across the European Union so that, for example, winemakers from outside a region like Tuscany can not produce a Sangiovese wine and call it a Chianti. While the wine may be made from the same clonal variety of Sangiovese, in the same soil composition as found in the Chianti region with winemakers using the Tuscan method of production, there is an assumption that the two wines will be different due to terroir. The names of these European wine regions are protected so that wines from different regions and different terroir are not confused with wines from that those regions – i.e. A Spanish or Australian \\"chianti\\". In the United States there is some confusion over the use of semi-generic names like Champagne and Port but there has been more effort by the American wine industry to recognize the unique association of place names with the wines produced in those places, such as the 2005 Napa Declaration on Place agreement. While appellation systems and the protected designations of origin can be a way of protecting \\"unique terroir\\", the commercial importance of terroir has been a much debated topic in the wine industry. In Spain in 2018, networks of vintners joined in a grassroots movement to produce wines with added terroir value with intention to enhance the Spanish rural wine culture. =Commercial interests= The importance of terroir affects the price of the agricultural product as well as the products made from the product. Branding, variety, and farmer identification affects the price of a product. The Slow Food movement appreciates history of a variety of plant or animal, the story of the farmer who produced it, and ultimately the quality of the product. Chefs and bakers develop their own list of qualities they desire for their creations, and terroir affects these. Wine critics question the value of a Pinot noir wine from a Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard relative to a wine produced from the \\"lesser terroir\\" of a Premier Cru vineyard, and whether it merits the higher price. These doubts also arise when the quality of winemaking and other human influences are taken into account, which may be of a higher standard with the \\"lesser\\" premier cru. These critics also question the difference between New World and Old World wine and whether modern winemaking techniques – like significant oak influences, over-ripened fruit, cultured yeast, micro- oxygenation, and color pigment additives – obscure or even eliminate the influence of terroir in making different regions unique. Critics often point to the homogenizing effect on mass-produced wines made from popular varietals like Chardonnay, which may have their terroir characteristics hidden by invasive and intensive winemaking. A heavily oaked, over-ripe Chardonnay from California can taste very similar to the same style of wine from elsewhere. The marketability of wines from different regions and producers is affected by the importance accorded to terroir, both by the wine industry and consumer wine markets, with some producers downplaying terroir and its effect on their wines. Outside of France In the United States, the principles of terroir have been applied in a few limited instances, such as Vidalia onions, whose production area has been defined by the United States Department of Agriculture an Indian River fruit, which can only carry that label if grown within an area defined by the United States Federal Trade Commission. In some East Asian countries, terms like terroir or marriage have been popularised by Japanese manga. A 2008–09 Korean drama, most of whose leading characters work with wine, is titled Terroir after the main setting, a wine restaurant in turn named for the concept. In popular culture The concept of terroir has been discussed in several films and television shows. Jonathan Nossiter's 2004 documentary, Mondovino, explores the globalization of the wine business, and features interviews with a number of small producers, mostly French, who talk about terroir. In the 2006 BBC series, Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure, one episode is almost entirely devoted to Oz Clarke teaching James May about terroir. At the end of the episode, May identifies three wines successfully, placing them in the correct order on the basis of the quality of terroir they come from. Les Blank and Gina Leibrecht's 2007 documentary, All In This Tea, explores the importance of terroir and organic growing methods for the quality and future sustainability of the Chinese tea market. Terroir is also a frequent topic of discussion in the Japanese wine comic Les Gouttes de Dieu. The films French Kiss and A Good Year also make references to terroir. Terroir recognition is a plot turning point in the 1976 French comedy L'aile ou la cuisse (The Wing or the Thigh) with Louis de Funès. In 2014 Keith Carradine starred in John Charles Jopson's Edgar Allan Poe-inspired film Terroir.

It is related to the word shura, meaning consultation or \\"taking counsel\\". As an official title, it historically indicates a personal advisor to the ruler. In this use it is roughly comparable to the European titles of State Counsellor and counsellor of state. In a military context, mushir became associated with the idea of the ruler's personal counsellor or advisor on military matters, and as such became the highest rank in Arab countries and the Ottoman Empire. It is used as the highest rank in most armed forces of the Middle East and North Africa, for armies, navies, and air forces. It is therefore equivalent to the ranks of Field Marshal and Admiral of the Fleet.  Iraq  In Iraq under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi navy maintained a fleet admiral rank known as Mushir. A Mushir was the most senior of all naval officers and the rank was rarely bestowed. The sleeve insignia was the same as a British Admiral of the Fleet. The rank of Mushir in Iraq is known as \\"Muhib\\" and is used in all official and unofficial addresses. Saddam Hussein as commander-in-chief of the armed forces was an honorary \\"staff muhib\\" () in the Iraqi army, and the uniform which he typically wore was that of a staff muhib.

Bischoff, along with Richard Diebenkorn and David Park, was part of the post-World War II generation of artists who started as abstract painters and found their way back to figurative art. Biography Elmer Bischoff, second child of John and Elna (née Nelson) Bischoff, grew up in Berkeley, California, the second-generation Californian son of a father of German descent and a mother of mixed Swedish-Ecuadoran origin. He entered the University of California, Berkeley, in September 1934, completing his master's degree in May 1939, and immediately started teaching art at Sacramento High School (1939–41). During his years at university, one teacher had influenced him most: the highly independent-minded Margaret Peterson, whose total dedication to her teaching, and insistence on the ethical value of art, were to have a great impact on the artist Elmer Bischoff would be. World War II, however, was to change Bischoff's life. In 1941, he served as a lieutenant colonel in intelligence services of the United States Army Air Forces in England, stationing near Oxford, and only coming back to the US in November 1945. After the war, back in San Francisco, Bischoff found himself once more in the midst of avant-garde artistic ebullience - mixing, among other painters (and to name but two), with such artists as Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. In January 1946, a golden opportunity was offered him: one of his artist friends, Karl Kasten (himself a war veteran, like Bischoff) suggested Bischoff as art teacher for a position still available, at San Francisco's California School of Fine Arts. It was then that Bischoff entered a faculty which already included some of the most talented new artists of post-war America. It is there that he eventually met David Park and Richard Diebenkorn. In 1973, Bischoff was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1985. While distinct from expressionist art that came from Europe, art of the Bay Area Figurative Movement displays the immediacy and warmth that one sees in abstract expressionist painting. Elmer Bischoff was older than Diebenkorn, and he had experiences in the world that led to his taking an independent turn in painting. Bischoff's quiet and lyrical paintings were serious in a different way from the painting which was being taken seriously at the time; and which saw the rise of Abstract expressionism. A retrospective of Elmer Bischoff's work, Grand Lyricist: The Art of Elmer Bischoff, was offered by the Oakland Museum of California, November 3, 2001- January 13, 2002. The Crocker Art Museum (California), the de Young Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C.), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art (Kansas City, Missouri), the Museum of the National Academy of Design (New York City), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (Texas), the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, the Orange County Museum of Art, The Phillips Collection (Washington D.C.), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.) are among the public collections holding works by Elmer Bischoff.

Agne being hanged by his wife Skjalf. Artwork by Hugo Hamilton, 1830 King Agni's Barrow just southeast of Sollentuna Station in Sweden. Snorri Sturluson relates that he was the son of Dag the Wise, and he was mighty and famous. He was also skilled in many ways. One summer, he went to Finland with his army where he pillaged. The Finns gathered a vast host under a chief named Frosti.This chief has the same name as the Jotun Frosti who was the father of Snær the Old, and consequently Agne's great- great-great-great-grandfather. A great battle ensued which Agne won and many Finns were killed together with Frosti. Agne then subdued all of Finland with his army, and captured not only great booty but also Frosti's daughter Skjalf and her kinsman Logi.In the older Ynglingatal only her kinsman, but in Heimskringla he was her brother, which seems to be a mistake by Snorri Sturluson. Agne returned to Sweden and they arrived at Stocksund (Stockholm) where they put up their tent on the side of the river where it is flat. Agne had a torc which had belonged to Agne's great-great-great-grandfather Visbur. Agne married Skjalf. Skjalf asked Agne to honour her dead father Frosti with a great feast, which he granted. He invited a great many guests, who gladly arrived to visit the now even more famous Swedish king. They had a drinking competition in which Agne became very drunk. Skjalf saw her opportunity and asked Agne to take care of Visbur's torc, which was around his neck. Agne bound it fast around his neck before he went to sleep. The king's tent was next to the woods and was under the branches of a tall tree for shade. When Agne was fast asleep, Skjalf took a rope which she attached to the torc. Then she had her men remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told her men to pull the rope and they hanged Agne, avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland. Agne was buried at the place, now called Agnafit, which is east of the Tauren (the Old Norse name for Södertörn) and west of Stocksund. {  :Þat tel ek undr, :ef Agna her :Skalfar ráð :at sköpum þóttu, :þar gœðing :með gullmeni :Loga dís :at lopti hóf :svalan hest :Signýjar vers.Ynglinga saga at Norrøne Tekster og KvadA second online presentation of Ynglingatal  :How do ye like the high-souled maid, :Who, with the grim Fate-goddess' aid, :Avenged her sire? – made Swithiod's king :Through air in golden halter swing? :How do ye like her, Agne's men? :Think ye that any chief again :Will court the fate your chief befell, :To ride on wooden horse to hell?.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr  } Ynglingatal then gives Alrekr and Eiríkr as Agne's successors.

Instead Alrekr is Agne's predecessor and Agne is succeeded by Yngvi (incorrectly called Ingialdr). The even earlier source Íslendingabók cites the line of descent in Ynglingatal and it gives the same line of succession as Historia Norwegiæ: xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi.Guðni Jónsson's edition of Íslendingabók The location indicated by Snorri Sturluson as the place of Agne's death has a barrow called Kung Agnes hög (King Agne's barrow) in Lillhersby, Sollentuna.

He played for the Cincinnati Reds (1999–2003), Boston Red Sox (2003-), Chicago Cubs (2005–2006), San Diego Padres (2006), and the Baltimore Orioles (2007). After a lightning-fast start: going from college to the major leagues in two years, with just five appearances at the Triple-A level and winning National League Rookie of the Year honors, Williamson's career tailed off in the mid-2000s as he suffered repeated injuries and spent long stretches on the disabled list.  Career  =Amateur= Williamson attended Friendswood High School in Friendswood, Texas. In his senior year he posted a 0.68 ERA and was named district MVP. In college, Williamson played for first Tulane University and then Oklahoma State University. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. With Oklahoma State, he earned Big 12 first-team honors during the 1996-1997 school year. Williamson entered the draft after the season was over and was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th round, 276th pick overall. = Cincinnati Reds = Cincinnati assigned Williamson their rookie affiliate, the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League. Starting for Billings, Williamson went 8-2 with a 1.78 ERA, the best in the league that year. For 1998 Cincinnati promoted Williamson to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League, bypassing Single-A altogether. In his first start for the Lookouts Williamson faced Atlanta Braves veteran John Smoltz, down with the Greenville Braves on a rehabilitation assignment. Williamson held his own, giving up two runs in six innings in a 6-5 loss. Mark Berry, Lookouts manager, praised Williamson's performance: \\"I was highly impressed...I expected him to be more erratic because of Smoltz, the big crowd and the whole situation. It's something he can build on.\\" Williamson would start just 18 games for the Lookouts that year after battling injuries, but at the end of the season Cincinnati promoted him to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Cincinnati planned to call Williamson up in September but he \\"stretched a tendon in the middle finger of his pitching hand\\" during a game for Indianapolis, ending his season. Cincinnati invited Williamson to spring training in 1999, where the combination of an impressive performance and injuries to key members of the pitching staff, including Denny Neagle and Stan Belinda, led to Williamson making the major league club despite having made just five appearances at the Triple-A level and never being on the 40-man roster. Williamson made his major league debut in relief on April 5, 1999. In his rookie season with Cincinnati Williamson went 12-7 with 107 strikeouts, a 2.41 earned run average and 19 saves; made the All-Star team, and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Williamson was the first Reds player to be so honored since Chris Sabo in 1988. During the 1999-2000 off-season Williamson's name came up several times in trade talks with the Seattle Mariners, who were looking to deal Ken Griffey, Jr., but in the end Williamson remained with Cincinnati. Williamson returned for the 2000 season but was bedeviled by injuries, including two broken toes in mid-September. He made fewer appearances than in 1999 but pitched more innings, due in part to joining the starting rotation after the All-Star break. After a lackluster spring training Cincinnati returned Williamson to the bullpen, but after two appearances went on the disabled list with a torn ligament in his shoulder. After consultation with orthopedic surgeon James Andrews Williamson underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his season. Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden called it \\"Devastating, just devastating.\\" Williamson returned to the bullpen for the 2002 season and went 3-4 with a 2.92 ERA. For 2003 Williamson took over as closer and saved 21 games in 43 appearances. On July 31, 2003 Cincinnati traded Williamson to the Boston Red Sox for Phil Dumatrait, Tyler Pelland and cash. The move was part of a fire sale instigated by Cincinnati management after Bowden and manager Bob Boone were fired. = Boston Red Sox = The New York Yankees had also been interested in Williamson; that Boston acquired him from Cincinnati was widely touted as a coup for Boston general manager Theo Epstein. USA Today sportswriter Hal Bodley placed the Williamson trade in the context of Red Sox- Yankees rivalry: > The Sauerbeck-Williamson deals give the Red Sox and Epstein a measure of > revenge. They were stung last winter when the Yankees outbid them in a > bitter battle for Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras. The mid-season arrival of Williamson, along with Scott Sauerbeck, Jeff Suppan and Byung Hyun Kim was expected to boost an already strong Boston team to the 2003 World Series. Williamson's tenure with Boston was a troubled one: his ERA with the team was 6.20 and he pitched just 20 innings in 24 appearances. In mid-September he underwent an MRI but the result was negative. As Boston entered the playoffs he shared closer duties with Mike Timlin. In the American League Championship series against New York, Williamson earned saves in Games 1, 4 and 6. Nevertheless, Little left a tiring Pedro Martínez in the 8th inning of Game 7 with Boston up 5-2. Martinez gave up three runs and New York would eventually win in the 11th inning 6-5. Critics maintain that Little should have pulled Martinez in favor of Williamson or Timlin, but that their mixed record during the regular season led Little to stay with the veteran Martinez. Williamson returned to Boston in 2004 as a middle reliever and got off to a strong start (1.69 ERA in 14 appearances) before elbow tendinitis placed him on the disabled list again in late May. Williamson returned in mid- June, but never felt completely healthy and went back on the DL at the beginning of July with a nerve impingement in his right forearm. The return to the DL was not without controversy: Williamson, feeling pain in a game against the Yankees (which the Red Sox would go on to lose), took himself out of the game. What happened next is a matter of dispute. Contemporary media accounts claim that Boston veteran starting pitcher Curt Schilling confronted Williamson and \\"questioned [Williamson's] manhood.\\" Schilling would later downplay the incident, acknowledging that he and Williamson \\"had words\\" but that Schilling never doubted that Williamson was injured. Williamson indicated that he and Schilling never patched things up and said that \\"Unfortunately, it happened. He's got his opinion, but it wasn't right.\\" In August Boston placed Williamson on the 60-day disabled list as word spread that he might undergo a second \\"Tommy John\\" surgery, which would end the 2004 season and likely preclude any activity in 2005 as well. Defying predictions, Williamson returned in September and finished the season with a 1.26 ERA in 28 appearances. However, he was left off the post-season roster and underwent surgery as Boston won the 2004 World Series. Williamson filed for free agency at the end of the season, and departed the organization after Boston declined to offer arbitration. = Chicago Cubs = At the start of 2005 the Chicago Cubs signed Williamson to a minor league contract and added him to their 40-man roster, but he almost immediately went on the 60-day disabled list: in the end Williamson had undergone the second Tommy John surgery and was not yet recovered. Williamson returned to the team in August but struggled with his velocity. Sportswriters wondered at the wisdom of coming back in less than 12 months without the benefit of spring training. Williamson himself said that he was \\"trying to find my rhythm and it's hard to do that at the big-league level.\\" Williamson eventually appeared in 17 games; his ERA, 8.68 in the beginning of September, dropped to 5.65 by the end of the season. Showing its confidence in Williamson, Chicago exercised its option to bring him back for another season. Williamson made the 2006 team as a middle reliever, losing the closer's job to Ryan Dempster. Williamson had expressed a willingness to be traded if it meant taking over the closer's job for the new team. In early June, after making 23 appearances with an ERA over 4, Williamson went back on the disabled list with tendinitis. Williamson returned at the end of June and pitched in eight more games, but on July 22 Chicago traded him to the San Diego Padres for minor League pitchers Fabian Angulo and Joel Santo. = San Diego Padres = Williamson joined a San Diego team in first place in the National League West division, a prospect which cheered him: \\"Going from second-to-last to first place, that's always exciting.\\" In an interview with the Galveston County Daily News, Williamson also expressed disappointment at the way Chicago manager Dusty Baker had used him and revealed that he had considered retiring altogether. Now with San Diego, Williamson said that he was \\"having a lot of fun here, and I'm back to being myself, laughing and joking.\\" Just days after that interview was published, Williamson made his last appearance for San Diego: an MRI revealed a bone chip in his elbow. Williamson returned to the DL and sat out the rest of the season. San Diego released Williamson on October 12. = Baltimore Orioles = In late November 2006 the Baltimore Orioles signed Williamson to a one-year contract. After six appearances and an ERA of 1.60, Williamson went on the disabled list with tightness in his right triceps tendon. Williamson returned in June and appeared in ten more games, but lingering questions about his health and a desire on the part of Baltimore's management to promote younger players led to him being designated for assignment on July 4. In sixteen games Williamson was 1-0 with a 4.40 ERA. Williamson cleared waivers and was released. = Around the minors = The New York Yankees signed Williamson to a minor league contract on July 22. He was released on August 5 after going 0-1 with a 9.82 ERA in 4 games with the Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees. In early February 2008, Williamson signed a one-year minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. He would have made $700,000 if he had made the Giants major league roster. After posting a 13.50 ERA with the Giants in spring training, Williamson was released on March 5, 2008. Williamson was signed to a minor league contract by the Atlanta Braves in April. They released him in early June. On June 15, 2008, the Seattle Mariners signed him to a minor league contract. After joining the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers and his third organization that year, Williamson remarked that \\"This year has been kind of a crazy year for me...It's kind of frustrating, but it feels good to go out and compete.\\" but he was released in late June after just three appearances. On January 24, 2009, Williamson signed a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers, who were looking for middle relievers after a disappointing 2008 season. In the end Williamson lost out to newcomer Ryan Perry and was sent down to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Detroit manager Jim Leyland praised Williamson's experience: \\"I think Scott Williamson has an excellent chance...You're talking about a pretty big-time Major League pitcher at one time.\\" Once in Toledo, however, Williamson had difficulties making a consistent outing and his ERA climbed steadily. On April 26, 2009, Toledo released Williamson to make room for Eddie Bonine, ending Williamson's comeback attempt within the Detroit Tigers organization. On August 2, 2010, Scott Williamson agreed to pitch for the Somerset Patriots. http://blogs.mycentraljersey.com/patriots/2010/08/02/coming-and-going/ = Coaching = Scott Williamson currently is a private pitching instructor.

They are often more responsible for administrative than operational matters, and in countries with conscript forces, often handle parts of the conscription cycle. Navies have also used a similar model, with organizations such as the United States Naval Districts. A number of navies in South America used naval districts at various points in time. Algeria Algerian military regions Algeria is divided into six numbered military regions, each with headquarters located in a principal city or town (see People's National Army (Algeria)#Military regions). This system of territorial organization, adopted shortly after independence, grew out of the wartime wilaya structure and the postwar necessity of subduing antigovernment insurgencies that were based in the various regions. Regional commanders control and administer bases, logistics, and housing, as well as conscript training. Commanders of army divisions and brigades, air force installations, and naval forces report directly to the Ministry of National Defence and service chiefs of staff on operational matters. Previously Algeria had formed France's tenth military region. Military region commanders in 2003 included Brahim Fodel Chérif (1st Military Region), Kamel Abderrahmane (2nd Military Region, Abcène Tafer (3rd Military Region), Abdelmadjid Sahed (4th Military Region, Chérif Abderrazak (5th Military Region) and Ali Benali (6th Military Region).Isabelle Werenfels, 'Managing Instability in Algeria: Elites and Political Change since 1995,' p.186 (fn 51). China =Republic of China= There were 76 northern military districts or military regions (軍區), or war areas, which were the largest formations of the National Revolutionary Army, under the Military Affairs Commission, chaired by Chiang Kai-shek during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the National Revolutionary Army eventually organized itself into twelve Military Regions. =People's Republic of China= The military regions (originally eleven, then seven) of the People's Liberation Army were divided into military districts (usually contiguous with provinces) and military sub-districts, under the command of the Central Military Commission. In February 2016, the 7 military regions were changed to 5 theater commands:http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160201/47322320_0.shtml#_zbs_baidu_bk * Eastern Theater Command * Southern Theater Command * Western Theater Command * Northern Theater Command * Central Theater Command France =Third Republic= Under the Third Republic, a military region comprised several departments which supported an army corps. For many years up to 21 military regions were active. =Fifth Republic= With the evolution of administrative organization, France was divided into regional administrative districts (circa 1963) (administrative region dependent of a prefect of the region). The military organisation then combined the administrative organization and in each CAR corresponded a territorial military division (TMD). On the defence side, these military divisions have been grouped into military regions. Their number varied depending on the period. The current number is six. Germany =German Reich= During World War II, Germany used the system of military districts () to relieve field commanders of as much administrative work as possible and to provide a regular flow of trained recruits and supplies to the Field Army. The method they adopted was to separate the Field Army (Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres) from the Home Command (Heimatkriegsgebiet) and to entrust the responsibilities of training, conscription, supply and equipment to that command. The Commander of the Infantry Corps with the identical number also commanded the Wehrkreis in peacetime, but command of the Wehrkreis passed to his second-in command at the outbreak of war. In peacetime, the Wehrkreis was the home to the Infantry Corps of the same number and all subordinate units of that Corps. =Federal Republic of Germany= Until 2013 the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) had four military districts – Wehrbereichskommando (WBK) as part of the Streitkräftebasis or Joint Service Support Command. Each WBK controlled several Landeskommandos (State Commands) due to the federal structure of Germany who have taken over functions carried out by the Verteidigungsbezirkskommandos (VBKs) or Military Region Commands (Defence District Commands) as. These command authorities are in charge of all military facilities. Now the Landeskommmandos are led by the National Territorial Command called Kommando Territoriale Aufgaben der Bundeswehr (KdoTerrAufgBw). Indonesia Kodam districts as of 2007 in Indonesia Mulawarman Military district command HQ, situated in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan Siliwangi Military district command HQ in Bandung, West Java The Indonesian Army (Bahasa Indonesia: Tentara Nasional Indonesia - Angkatan Darat \\"TNI-AD\\") uses military districts, known as Komando Daerah Militer (Military Region command) or KODAM. It was created by General Sudirman as a system initially called \\"Wehrkreise\\", adapted from the German system during World War II. The system was later ratified in \\"Surat Perintah Siasat No.1\\" (No.1 Strategy Command Letter), signed on November 1948. Military regional commands functioned as a means of circles of defense, or regional defense, to defend the designated islands/provinces under Indonesian territory. Each MRC commander had full authority to begin operations with assets available in the district. MRC commanders have command and autonomy over its military structures and organizations. Kazakhstan Regional Commands of Kazakhstan A Regional Command (, Aımaqtyq qolbasshylyq; , Regional'naya komanda) in Kazakhstan operates in a similar fashion to Russian military districts. The Kazakh Ground Forces are divided into four regional commands:http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/kazachztan/kazachstan-grand.htm Kazakh Ground Forces *Regional Command \\"Astana\\" headquartered in Nur-Sultan *Regional Command \\"East\\" headquartered in Semey *Regional Command \\"West\\" headquartered in Atyrau *Regional Command \\"South\\" headquartered in Taraz Poland Initially, right after the First World War, Poland had five military districts (1918–1921): * Kraków Military District (Krakowski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Kraków * Łódź Military District (Łódzki Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Łódź * Lublin Military District (Lubelski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Lublin. * Poznań Military District (Poznański Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Poznań * Warsaw Military District (Warszawski Okręg Wojskowy), HQ in Warszawa. In 1921, due to reorganization, the military districts were replaced with Dowództwo Okręgu Korpusu (DOK – Corps District Command). In the Second Polish Republic there were ten DOKs: * I – Warszawa * II – Lublin * III – Grodno * IV – Łódź * V – Kraków * VI – Lwów * VII – Poznań * VIII – Toruń * IX – Brześć nad Bugiem * X – Przemyśl Each DOK consisted of four large units (three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade). For district arrangements after World War II see Polish Land Forces. The Kraków Military District disbanded in 1953. From 1999 Poland has been divided into two military districts, the Pomeranian Military District and the Silesian Military District, both were disbanded by the end of 2011. Russia and the Soviet Union =Russian Empire= Military districts of the Russian Empire in 1913 The Russian Empire's military district (, voyenny okrug) was a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military establishments. This territorial division type was utilized in Imperial Russia, USSR and is currently in use in Russian Federation. Such territorial division provided convenient management of army units, their training and other activities regarding the country's readiness to defend itself. =Soviet Union= In the USSR, the military districts continued to perform the same role they had done in the Russian Empire, with first six military districts (Yaroslavsky, Moskovsky, Orlovsky, Belomorsky, Uralsky, and Privolzhsky) were formed on 31 March 1918 during the Russian Civil War. This increased to 17 military districts of the USSR at the beginning of July 1940 shortly before the USSR was invaded by Germany and entered the Second World War, and were used to create combat Fronts after commencement of the German invasion of the USSR. During the war the districts were further divided into geographic regions for logistic reasons, these being: *North and North Western districts *West and Central USSR districts *South and South Western districts *Siberian and Central Asian districts *Far Eastern districts After the war, the number was increased to 33 to aid in demobilisation of forces, but by October 1946, they had been reduced to 21.V.I. Feskov et al, The Soviet Army in the Period of the Cold War, Tomsk, 2004 By the end of the 1980s, immediately before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there were sixteen military districts, within three to five main strategic Theatre groupings. =Russian Federation= A military district (, voyenny okrug) in the Russian Federation operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. (Previously under Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces General Nikolai Kormiltsev, the military districts reported to the General Staff via the Russian Ground Forces staff.) It is a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military establishments. This territorial division type was historically adopted, originally by Imperial Russia, to provide a more efficient management of army units, their training and other operations activities related to combat readiness. From 1992 to 2010, the Armed Forces maintained a diminishing number of former Soviet Armed Forces districts – Leningrad Military District, Moscow Military District, Volga-Urals Military District, North Caucasus Military District, Siberian Military District, Far East Military District. Military districts of Russia as of 2016 In 2009–2010, these districts were reorganised into 4 Military Districts comprising regional Joint Strategic Commands: In 2014 Northern Fleet was reorganized into separate Joint Strategic Command. *Western Military District with headquarters in Saint Petersburg *Southern Military District with headquarters in Rostov-on-Don *Central Military District with headquarters in Ekaterinburg *Eastern Military District with headquarters in Khabarovsk *Northern Fleet with headquarters in Severomorsk Sweden The military district (, usually abbreviated to Milo) was an administrative division of the Swedish Armed Forces, and was a higher regional level subdivision. The commander of a military district, the Militärområdesbefälhavare (also militärbefälhavare), commanded the Swedish Army divisions stationed in the region, the regional naval command, the regional air defence sector as well as the lower regional level subdivision defence districts that made up the military district. The commander answered directly to the Supreme Commander. The military districts in the modern form were created in 1966, and each district was named according to the geographical area they covered. Several changes were made, such as creating or merging districts, until all military districts were disbanded in 2000. After the Defence Act of 2000 the military districts were replaced by new military districts (, usually abbreviated to MD). The new military districts corresponded geographically to the former military districts, however, they did not have the same territorial and operational tasks. In 2005, the military districts were replaced to some extent by four Security and Cooperation Sections (). United Kingdom British Army regional districts have evolved slowly over the previous 150 years or so. For many years there were regional commands in the UK, including Aldershot Command (from 1880), Eastern Command, Northern Command, Scottish Command, Southern Command and Western Command (from 1905). By 1985 these were superseded by districts, and until the spring of 1991 there were nine of them. Antony Beevor wrote in his revised edition of Inside the British Army in 1991 that '..the first of the minor districts to be amalgamated were North West District, Western District, and Wales, to form a new Western District.' HQ Northern Ireland remained separate and reported to HQ UK Land Forces only on non-operational matters.Beevor, 1991 revised edition, 232. Structure Regional Forces c.2006 From 1995, UK commands and later districts were replaced by regenerative divisions. 2nd Division, 4th Division, 5th Division and London District acted as regional commands within the UK reporting to Commander Regional Forces. Scotland District was absorbed by 2nd Division in 2000. The divisions were responsible for training subordinate formations and units under their command for operations in the UK, such as Military Aid to the Civil Community, as well as training units for overseas deployments. 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions were replaced by Support Command on 1 November 2011.Charles Heyman, 'The British Army: A Pocket Guide 2012-2013', p.31 United States The military department was a military and administrative command of the US Army. Present day US military organization is structured around Unified Combatant Commands, which encompass different geographical areas and responsibilities.

Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.Hopper (1978) p. 16. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions. The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.  Early history  During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of historians as the world's first published computer program. The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first programming language.  First programming languages  In the 1940s, the first recognizably language required a great deal of intellectual effort. An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalkül, developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1943 and 1945 but not implemented at the time.In 1998 and 2000 compilers were created for the language as a historical exercise. Rojas, Raúl, et al. (2000). \\"Plankalkül: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation\\". Institut frame Informatik, Freie Universität Berlin, Technical Report B-3/2000. (full text) The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s. John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer. Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code. In the early 1950s, Alick Glennie developed Autocode, possibly the first compiled programming language, at the University of Manchester. In 1954, a second iteration of the language, known as the \\"Mark 1 Autocode,\\" was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker. Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by Douglas Hartree of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimization and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine. In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. When FORTRAN was first introduced, it was viewed with skepticism due to bugs, delays in development, and the comparative efficiency of \\"hand-coded\\" programs written in assembly. However, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving; the language eventually became known for its efficiency. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype.Hopper (1978) p. 16. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.Sammet (1969) p. 316 Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.Sammet (1978) p. 204. Other languages still in use today include LISP (1958), invented by John McCarthy and COBOL (1959), created by the Short Range Committee. Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of \\"a new language for algorithms\\"; the ALGOL 60 Report (the \\"ALGOrithmic Language\\"). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations: * nested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into blocks without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures; * lexical scoping: a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, that is, information hiding. Another innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described: * a mathematically exact notation, Backus–Naur form (BNF), was used to describe the language's syntax. Nearly all subsequent programming languages have used a variant of BNF to describe the context-free portion of their syntax. Algol 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular. The Burroughs large systems were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of Algol. Algol's key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68: * syntax and semantics became even more orthogonal, with anonymous routines, a recursive typing system with higher-order functions, etc.; * not only the context-free part, but the full language syntax and semantics were defined formally, in terms of Van Wijngaarden grammar, a formalism designed specifically for this purpose. Algol 68's many little-used language features (for example, concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being difficult. Niklaus Wirth actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler Pascal language. Fortran Some notable languages that were developed in this period include: {  valign=top  * 1951 – Regional Assembly Language * 1952 – Autocode * 1954 – IPL (forerunner to LISP) * 1955 – FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL) * 1957 – FORTRAN (first compiler) * 1957 – COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL) * 1958 – LISP * 1958 – ALGOL 58 * 1959 – FACT (forerunner to COBOL) * 1959 – COBOL  valign=top  * 1959 – RPG * 1962 – APL * 1962 – Simula * 1962 – SNOBOL * 1963 – CPL (forerunner to C) * 1964 – Speakeasy * 1964 – BASIC * 1964 – PL/I * 1966 – JOSS * 1966 - MUMPS * 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to C) }  Establishing fundamental paradigms  Scheme The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period: * Speakeasy, developed in 1964 at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) by Stanley Cohen, is an OOPS (object-oriented programming system, much like the later MATLAB, IDL and Mathematica) numerical package. Speakeasy has a clear Fortran foundation syntax. It first addressed efficient physics computation internally at ANL, was modified for research use (as \\"Modeleasy\\") for the Federal Reserve Board in the early 1970s and then was made available commercially; Speakeasy and Modeleasy are still in use currently. * Simula, invented in the late 1960s by Nygaard and Dahl as a superset of Algol 60, was the first language designed to support object- oriented programming. * C, an early systems programming language, was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973. * Smalltalk (mid-1970s) provided a complete ground-up design of an object-oriented language. * Prolog, designed in 1972 by Colmerauer, Roussel, and Kowalski, was the first logic programming language. * ML built a polymorphic type system (invented by Robin Milner in 1973) on top of Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional programming languages. Each of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry. The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of \\"structured programming\\", which essentially meant programming without the use of \\"goto\\". A significant fraction of programmers believed that, even in languages that provide \\"goto\\", it is bad programming style to use it except in rare circumstances. This debate was closely related to language design: some languages did not include a \\"goto\\" at all, which forced structured programming on the programmer. To provide even faster compile times, some languages were structured for \\"one- pass compilers\\" which expect subordinate routines to be defined first, as with Pascal, where the main routine, or driver function, is the final section of the program listing. Some notable languages that were developed in this period include: {  valign=top  * 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to B) * 1968 – Logo * 1969 – B (forerunner to C) * 1970 – Pascal * 1970 – Forth * 1972 – C  valign=top  * 1972 – Smalltalk * 1972 – Prolog * 1973 – ML * 1975 – Scheme * 1978 – SQL (a query language, later extended) }  1980s: consolidation, modules, performance  MATLAB Erlang Tcl The 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade. One important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of modules, or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs---generics being, in essence, parametrized modules (see also polymorphism in object- oriented programming). Although major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and Emerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed systems. The 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The RISC movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by processor speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compilation techniques, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compilation technology for high-level languages. Language technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s. Some notable languages that were developed in this period include: {  valign=top  * 1980 – C++ (as C with classes, renamed in 1983) * 1983 – Ada * 1984 – Common Lisp * 1984 – MATLAB * 1984 – dBase III, dBase III Plus (Clipper and FoxPro as FoxBASE, later developing into Visual FoxPro) * 1985 – Eiffel * 1986 – Objective-C  valign=top  * 1986 – LabVIEW (Visual Programming Language) * 1986 – Erlang * 1987 – Perl * 1988 – Tcl * 1988 – Wolfram Language (as part of Mathematica, only got a separate name in June 2013) * }  1990s: the Internet age  Haskell Lua PHP Rebol The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many \\"rapid application development\\" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE, garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal, Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention. More radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages. These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain. Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web. Some notable languages that were developed in this period include: {  valign=top  * 1990 – Haskell * 1990 – Python * 1991 – Visual Basic * 1993 – Lua * 1993 – R * 1994 – CLOS (part of ANSI Common Lisp)  valign=top  * 1995 – Ruby * 1995 – Ada 95 * 1995 – Java * * 1995 – JavaScript * 1995 – PHP * 1997 – Rebol }  Current trends  Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included: D Programming Language Groovy PowerShell Rust Scratch Swift * Increasing support for functional programming in mainstream languages used commercially, including pure functional programming for making code easier to reason about and easier to parallelise (at both micro- and macro- levels) * Constructs to support concurrent and distributed programming. * Mechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, dependent typing, information flow control, static thread safety. * Alternative mechanisms for composability and modularity: mixins, traits, typeclasses, delegates, aspects. * Component- oriented software development. * Metaprogramming, reflection or access to the abstract syntax tree ** AOP or Aspect Oriented Programming allowing developers to insert code in another module or class at \\"join points\\" ** Domain specific languages and code generation *** XML for graphical interface (XUL, XAML) * Increased interest in distribution and mobility. * Integration with databases, including XML and relational databases. * Open source as a developmental philosophy for languages, including the GNU Compiler Collection and languages such as Python, Ruby, and Scala. * More interest in visual programming languages like Scratch, LabVIEW and PWCT * Massively parallel languages for coding 2000 processor GPU graphics processing units and supercomputer arrays including OpenCL * Early research into (as-yet-unimplementable) quantum computing programming languages * Early research in applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to generate code like using GPT-3 Some notable languages developed during this period include: {  valign=top  * 2000 – ActionScript * 2001 – C# * 2001 – D * 2002 – Scratch * 2003 – Groovy * 2003 – Scala * 2005 – F# * 2006 – PowerShell * 2007 – Clojure  valign=top  * 2008 – Nim * 2009 – Go * 2010 – Rust * 2011 – Dart * 2011 – Kotlin * 2011 – Elixir * 2012 – Julia * 2012 - TypeScript * 2014 – Swift } Other new programming languages include Red, Crystal, Elm, Hack, Haxe, Zig, Reason and Ballerina.

Originating in the car and heavy-duty truck industry in the United States, it is now widely used in other parts of the world. SAE J1939 is used in the commercial vehicle area for connection and communication throughout the vehicle, with the physical layer defined in ISO 11898. A different physical layer is used between the tractor and trailer, specified in ISO 11992. History Originally, Controller Area Network (CAN) was not mentioned in J1939, which covered cars and tractor-trailer rigs, and with some dual and triple use 8-bit addresses assigned by the SAE J1939 board. CAN was not originally free, but its instruction set did fit in the custom instruction format of J1939. This was true as of 2000. Since then, CAN has been included, the chipset for J1939 has been clocked faster, and 16-bit addresses (PGN) have replaced 8-bit addresses. J1939, ISO 11783 and NMEA 2000 all share the same high level protocol. SAE J1939 can be considered the replacement for the older SAE J1708 and SAE J1587 specifications. Definition SAE J1939 defines five layers in the seven-layer OSI network model, and this includes the Controller Area Network (CAN) ISO 11898 specification (using only the 29-bit/\\"extended\\" identifier) for the physical and data-link layers. Under J1939/11 and J1939/15, the data rate is specified as 250 kbit/s, with J1939/14 specifying 500 kbit/s. The session and presentation layers are not part of the specification. The later use of CAN FD is currently discussed. All J1939 packets, except for the request packet, contain eight bytes of data and a standard header which contains an index called Parameter Group Number (PGN), which is embedded in the message's 29-bit identifier. A PGN identifies a message's function and associated data. J1939 attempts to define standard PGNs to encompass a wide range of automotive, agricultural, marine and off-road vehicle purposes. A range of PGNs (00FF0016 through 00FFFF16, inclusive) is reserved for proprietary use. PGNs define the data which is made up of a variable number of Suspect Parameter Number (SPN) elements defined for unique data. For example, there exists a predefined SPN for engine RPM. Applications SAE J1939 has been adopted widely by diesel engine manufacturers. One driving force behind this is the increasing adoption of the engine Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which provides one method of controlling exhaust gas emissions within US and European standards. The telematics data is used (via Fleet Telematics Systems) by Fleet Management Systems to let fleet operators keep track of vehicle and driver performance, such as fuel consumption, safety events, and repair time. Because of the demanding standards, engine development is expensive, and truck-based engines are reused in many fields. Consequently, SAE J1939 can now be found in a range of diesel- powered applications: vehicles (on- and off-road and rail), marine propulsion, power generation and industrial pumping.

Contextually, it refers to conveying the message of Islam.\\" is a Sunni Islamic missionary movement that focuses on exhorting Muslims and encouraging fellow members to return to practising their religion as it was practised during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and particularly in matters of ritual, dress and personal behaviour. The organisation is estimated to have between 12 million to 80 million adherents worldwide, with the majority living in South Asia, and a presence in somewhere between 180 and 200 countries. It has been deemed as \\"one of the most influential religious movements in 20th-century Islam.\\" Established in 1926 by Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi in Mewat region of India, it began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement, and as a response to perceived deterioration of moral values and a supposed neglect of the aspects of Islam. The movement aims for the spiritual reformation of Islam by working at the grassroots level. The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in \\"Six Principles\\" (Kalimah (Declaration of faith), Salah (Prayer), Ilm-o-zikr (Knowledge), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention), Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytizaton)). Tablighi Jamaat denies any affiliation in politics and involvement in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), focusing instead on the Quran and Hadith. However, the group has been accused of political links. The U.S. Government has closely monitored Tablighi Jamaat since September 2001. This has revealed that there are no direct links between the organisation and Islamic terrorism, although Islamic terrorist organisations have recruited from them. Tablighi Jamaat leaders have denied any links with terrorism. The Tablighi Jamaat strictly avoids political activities and debates, and instead focuses on religion only. The Jamaat does admit that it attracts all sorts of individuals, regardless of their social or political standing and doesn't control its membership. History The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat represented the intensification of individual reformation aspects of the original Deobandi movement. It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of Muslim political hegemony to the Maratha Empire and the subsequent consolidation of the British Raj. The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as Shuddhi (purification) and Sanghatan (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity. =Origin= Maulana Muhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Quran decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during Ilyas's second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque- based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers. Ilyas abandoned his teaching post at Madrasah Mazahir Uloom in Saharanpur and became a missionary for reforming Muslims (but he did not advocate preaching to non-Muslims). He relocated to Nizamuddin near Delhi, where this movement was formally launched in 1926, or 1927.Dietrich Reetz, Sûfî spirituality fires reformist zeal: The Tablîghî Jamâ‘at in today's India and Pakistan, Archives de sciences sociales des religions [En ligne], 135  juillet–septembre 2006, mis en ligne le 01 septembre 2009, consulté le 29 novembre 2014. p. 33. When setting the guidelines for the movement, he sought inspiration from the practices adopted by Muhammad at the dawn of Islam. Muhammad Ilyas put forward the slogan, , \\"O Muslims, become [true] Muslims!\\". This expressed the central focus of Tablighi Jamat: their aim to renew Muslims socially by uniting them in embracing the lifestyle of Muhammad. The movement gained a following in a relatively short period and nearly 25,000 people attended the annual conference in November 1941. At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders feared that Muslims were losing their religious identity and were heedless of Islamic rituals (mainly daily prayers). The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas called it Tahrik-i Imaan.Kepel, War for Muslim Minds, 2004: p. 261 The Mewat region where TJ started around Delhi was inhabited by the Meos, a Rajput ethnic group, some of whom had converted to Islam, and then re-converted to Hinduism when Muslim political power declined in the region, lacking the necessary acumen (according to one author, Ballard) required to resist the cultural and religious influence of majority Hindus, prior to the arrival of Tablighi Jamaat. =Expansion= Bishwa Ijtema in Bangladesh The group began to expand its activities in 1946. The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter was established in the hinterlands of Raiwind town near Lahore, Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest until Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan. Within two decades of its establishment, the group reached Southwest and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The Tablighi Jamaat's aversion to politics, and also its lack of any direct and practical economic-political-social viewpoints, like the occupation of Palestine, helped it enter and operate in societies, especially western countries and societies where politically active religious groups faced restrictions. =Foreign missions= The first foreign missions were sent to the Hejaz (western Saudi Arabia) and Britain in 1946. The United States followed and during the 1970s and 1980s the Tablighi Jamaat also established a large presence in continental Europe. In France it was introduced in the 1960s, and grew significantly in the two decades following 1970. In Europe Tablighi Jamaat focused on marginalised populations – \\"migrant workers deprived of any cultural access to European society, \`lost\` teens, drug addicts\\". It peaked in popularity and numbers in Europe between the mid-1970s and mid 1980s, and declined thereafter (in France it reportedly started to decline around 1989) as young people from Muslim families, educated in Europe, began to seek \\"a more intellectual framework for their faith\\", and moved toward Salafi Islam.Kepel, War for Muslim Minds, 2004: pp. 260–62 In France, as of 2004, it was represented on the French Council of the Muslim Faith. During the first half-decade of the 21st century Tablighi Jamaat went through a major revival in France, reaching 100,000 followers by 2006. However, the United Kingdom is the current focus of the movement in Europe, primarily due to the large South Asian population that began to arrive there in the 1960s. By 2007, Tablighi Jamaat members were situated at 600 of Britain's 1,350 mosques. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the movement made inroads into Central Asia. As of 2007, it was estimated that 10,000 Tablighi Jamaat members could be found in Kyrgyzstan, that was largely driven by Pakistani members initially. Pew Research Center estimates there are between 12 and 80 million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries. By some measures this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World. The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat are active in the United States. An attempt at Salafi expansion among the Muslim Chams in Vietnam has been halted by Vietnamese government controls, which has been of benefit to Tablighi Jamaat. Beliefs and objectives Members of Tabligh Jamat are allowed to follow their own fiqh as long as it does not deviate from Sunni Islam. Tablighi Jamaat defines its objective with reference to the concept of Dawah, the proselytizing or preaching of Islam. Tablighi Jamaat interprets Dawah as enjoining good and forbidding evil only and defines its objective within the framework of two particular Qur'anic verses which refer to this mission. Those two verses are: Tablighi Jamaat encourages everyone to fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self- reform. Like Salafists, Tabligh seek a \\"separation in their daily life from the \`impious\` society that surrounded them\\". The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in most sermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailed orthopraxy: \\"followers must dress like the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side\\"; enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your hand; and more. The movement encourages Muslims to spend time out of their daily routine in the tablighi activities so that the rest of routine could be harmonised with Tablighi lifestyle. Adherents are also encouraged to enroll in Deobandi madaaris (found around the world) to deepen their faith.Kepel, War for Muslim Minds, 2004: p. 83 The method adopted by Muhammad Ilyas was to organise units (called jamaats, meaning Assembly) of at least ten persons and send them to various villages or neighborhoods to preach. These outings, Dawah tours (see below), are now organised by TJ leaders. In these tours, emphasis is laid on \\"A hadith about virtues of action\\" (imitating Muhammad). In the ahadith (reported sayings of Muhammad) of fazail (virtues) these has been called Eemaan (faith) and Ihtisab (for the sake of Allah) and TJ believes this is the most vital deriving force for reward in akhirah (afterlife). TJ founder Ilyas preached that knowledge of virtues and A'amalu-Saliha (Good Deeds and Actions) takes precedence over the knowledge of Masa'il (jurisprudence). Knowing jurisprudence detail (Fara'id (mandates) and Sunan (traditions) of Salat) is useful only if a person is ready to perform rituals such as offering Salat. They insist that the best way of learning is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets, Sahaba (Companions of Prophet) and Awlia Allah (\\"Friends of Allah\\"). Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by Zakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. A collection of books, usually referred as Tablighi Nisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith). Tablighi ethic discourages social engagement or participation with some non-orthodox customary and ceremonial rituals which are usually extravagantly followed in South Asia. For example, marriages are performed en masse at annual congregations and other similar mass meetings, so that the costly celebrations common in South Asia are avoided. In its early days and in South Asia, the Tabligh movement aimed to return to orthodoxy and \\"purify\\" the Muslim religio- cultural identity of heterodox or \\"borderline\\" Muslims who still practised customs and religious rites connected with Hinduism. Especially to counteract the efforts of Hindu proselytising movements who targeted these often recently converts from Hinduism. Unlike common proselytising movements, has TJ mostly focused on making Muslims 'better and purer' and ideally \\"religiously perfect\\", rather than preaching to the non-Muslims. This is because (it believes) dawah to non-Muslims will only be effective (or will be much more effective) when a Muslim reaches \\"perfection\\". =Six Attributes (Sifāt)= Six Principles of Tabligh Jamaat TJ visits a village or neighborhood, invites the local Muslims to assemble in the mosque and present their message in the form of Six Attributes.These six Attributes were derived from the lives of the companions of Muhammad. It is stated in one narration, \\"My Sahabah (companions) are like [guiding] stars, whosoever follows [any] one of them will be guided.\\" [(Sahih Muslim 6466; 207-(2531) Darussalam ed.), Used in notable Fiqh books for 'judging' purpose]. Muslim's believe, they were the best human beings after Muhammad.Muhammad Ilyas just articulated six demands in the form of Six Sifāt which are quintessential to Tablighi Jamaat's teachings. Its basically a discussion about 6 special Attributes that one have to achieve, which will just make it Easy to follow the entire Dīn. According to them, the objectives are: # Kalimah/ ʾīmān [believe with conviction]: 'lā ilāha illā -llāh (There is) No god but Allah, muḥammadur rasūlu -llāh; is a sacred pledge of man with GOD (believe with conviction & adopt the lifestyle) which should transform one's Certainty, Lifestyle & Affection [from Creation to Creator ; Other's to Sunnah & Worldly to Afterlife]. # Namaz/Salah [Performing the prescribed prayers]: Achieve sahaba standard salah & certainty so that one can get spiritual elevation, piety and a life free from the ills of the material world . # Ilm with Zikr [Knowledge with Remembrance]: One have to achieve enough wisdom so that (A) able to differentiate between what is permissible-impermissible, purity-impurity, legitimacy-illegitimacy in all aspects of his/her life (B) Know that, at any given moment, in one's 24-hour existence, what GOD wants of him/ her. Ilm, Dhikr are interconnected & to get benefit one have to achieve them simultaneously. At each moment in one's worldly existence he/she have to achieve, a conscious awareness, nearness, a ta’aluq [relationship] and Ma'rifa [knowledge] of GOD. # Ikram al-Muslim [Honoring Muslims]: Treat fellow Muslims and non-Muslims with honor and deference. with all the rest of the Ummah (and by extension, all of creation) – be based on love, compassion, honor, generosity and respect. Instead of demanding them, one should not only forgo his/her rights, but become deeply concerned with giving others at least their due (rights stipulated by the Sacred Law). # Sahih Niyyah/ Ikhlāṣ [Only for GOD]: Sincerity of Intention – Reforming one's life in supplication to GOD by performing every human action (especially ibadah & Muamalat) for the sake of GOD and toward the goal of self-transformation\\". # Dawah & Tabligh/ Tabligh-i-waqt [Invitation and Conveyance]: Inviting and Preaching – The sparing of time to live a life based on faith and learning its virtues, following in the footsteps of Muhammad, and taking His message door to door for the sake of faith, so that (A) All of humanity (Including Oneself) until the Day Reckoning embodies the first five of the Six Attributes & (B) All of humanity attains salvation, saved from Hellfire by achieving Heaven. Organisation Kakrail Mosque, Dhaka. The Tablighi Jamaat movement in Bangladesh is mostly based here. Tablighi Jamaat follows an informal organisational structure and keeps an introvert institutional profile. It has been described as \\"a free-floating religious movement with minimal dependence on hierarchy, leadership positions, and decision-making procedures.\\" It keeps its distance from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly to avoid the disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as Tablighi Nisaab [Tablighi Curriculum]). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. The organisation's activities are coordinated through centres and headquarters called Markaz. Tablighi Jamaat is maintained from its international headquarters, called Nizamuddin Markaz, in the Nizamuddin West district of South Delhi, India, from where it originally started .It also has country headquarters in over 200 countries to co-ordinate its activities. These headquarters organise volunteer, self-funding people in groups (called jamaats), averaging ten to twelve people, for reminding Muslims to remain steadfast on path of Allah. These jamaats and preaching missions are self funded by their respective members. Amarat- Ameer is title of supervisor(doyen) in the Tabligh Jamaat and the attribute largely sought is the quality of faith, rather than the worldly rank. The ameer of Tabligh Jamaat is appointed for life by a central consultative council (shura) and elders of the Tabligh Jamaat. The first ameer was Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi, later succeeded by his son Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi and then by Maulana (cleric) Inaam ul Hasan. During sometime in 1992, 3 years before the time of his demise, Maulana (cleric) Inaamul Hasan, formed a 10-member Shura (committee) to appoint an ameer. This 10 member shura committee consisted of Maulana Saeed Ahmed Khan Sb, Mufti Zainul Abideen, Maulana Umar sb palanpuri, Maulana Izhar ul Hasan, Maulana Zubair ul hasan, Miyaji Mehraab sb, Haji Abdul Wahab Sb, Haji engineer Abdul Muqeet sb, Haji Afzal sb and Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi. Activities and traditions The activism of Tablighi Jamaat can be characterised by the last of the Six Principles. This principle, Tafrigh-i-Waqt (English: sparing of time) justifies the withdrawal from World, though temporarily, for travelling. Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organisation. They describe the purpose of this retreat as to patch the damages caused by the worldly indulgence and occasionally use the dry-dock parable to explain this. These individual jamaats, each led by an ameer, are sent from each markaz across the city or country to remind people to persist on the path of God. The duration of the work depends on the discretion of each jamaat. A trip can take an evening, a couple of days or a prolonged duration. =Khurūj (proselytising tour)= largest Islamic movement, Tabligh Jamaat encourages its followers to follow the pattern of spending \\"ten nights a month (Ashra),120 continuous days a year (Teen Chilla), and ultimately 150 days (5 Maah- Beroon) in tabligh missions\\". During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs. These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members. During their stay in mosques, these jamaats conduct a daily gasht, which involves visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably with the help of a guide called as rehbar. They invite people to attend the Maghrib prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam. Generally, the assumed role of these jamaat members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone. =Ijtema (annual gathering)= Bishwa Ijtema (World Gathering) of Muslims at Tongi, Bangladesh An annual gathering of followers, called ijtema, is summoned at headquarters of the respective countries. A typical ijtema continues for three days and ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2 million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts people from all over World. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called Bishwa Ijtema (World Gathering), converges followers from around the World in Tongi near Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 3 million people. In 2018 there was an ijtema in Aurangabad in India which changed the whole scenario of tablighi with minimum attendance of 4 million people gather from around the world under the patronage of Maulana saad khandalwi of nizamuddin markaz. The second largest Tabligh Jamaat gathering takes place in Raiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5 million people in 2004. In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and a total of 1 million people attended each of the two Ijtema. Role of women In TJ, women are encouraged to stay home, and to choose a life of \\"segregation between female and male\\". However they also engage in proselytizing activities, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another mahram) on proselytizing trips. Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children. According to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf, the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (mahram, محرم), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach. Controversies Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, Montasik, Aceh Besar, Aceh =Criticism= Due to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete hijab for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \\"strictly subservient and second string\\". Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist. Tablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare. Many critics, especially those from Hizb ut-Tahrir and Jamaat-e- Islami, criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an Islamic constitution in Pakistan (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969–1971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement (1977). The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of Ayub Khan (1960s) and Indira Gandhi (1975–77), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions. The difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure. TJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with Sufis. Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, the former grand mufti of Saudi Arabia is reported to have said that \\"Jama'atul-Tableegh ... have many deviations. They have some aspects of bid‘ah and shirk, so it is not permissible to go with them,\\" Another Salafi cleric, Falih Ibn Nafi Al-Harbi, has reportedly complained that TJ \\"are the originator of fictitious tales and baseless stories and people of bid‘ah.\\" = Allegations of extremism = The U.S. Government has closely monitored Tablighi Jamaat since September 2001. According to US officials, though the Tablighis do not have a direct link with terrorism, the teachings and beliefs of Tablighi Jamat have been a cornerstone for joining in radical Muslim groups. One of the terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook involved in the 2015 San Bernardino attack was a student of the teachings of Tablighi Jamaat. Tablighi Jamaat leaders have denied any links with terrorism. The Tablighi Jamaat generally avoids political activities and debates, and instead focuses on religion only. The Jamaat does admit that it attracts all sorts of individuals and doesn't control its membership. According to Pakistani security analysts and Indian investigators, The founders of terrorist group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen were members of the Tablighi Jamaat. The intelligence estimates that over 6,000 Tablighis were trained in Harkat-ul- Mujahideen terrorist camps in Pakistan. Some of the terrorist involved in the 9/11 terrorist attack had stayed in the premises of the Tablighi Jamaat centre in New Delhi. The Tablighi Jamaat was also suspected of involvement in the Godhra train burning in 2002, whick killed 59 Hindu pilgrims. In February 2020, a counter-terrorism operation in Russia led to the arrest of seven Tablighis and dismantled the terrorist cell affiliated to the Tablighi Jamaat. According to Russian intelligence, the terrorist cell was involved in dissemination of materials and radicalization. The Tablighi Jamat was banned Russia since 2009.The Supreme Court of Russia also recommendation the Tablighi Jamat to be included into the list of terrorist groups monitored by the Kremlin. The Tablighi Jamaat rejects secularism and believes in strict allegiance to Islamic lifestyle. Some have compared the group's ideology to Khawarij whereas others point out that the Tablighi Jamaat takes a \\"traditionalist\\" approach to Islam in contrast to Khawarij puritanical approach. Law enforcement officials says that Tablighi Jamaat's presence all around the world and its apolitical stance have been exploited by militant groups. Philip Haney described Tablighi Jamaat as a \\"trans-national Islamist network\\". The Tablighi Jamaat has been described as \\"a conduit and a fertile recruiting ground for jihadi organizations such as Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-i- Taiba\\". However, Tablighi Jamaat itself has not been accused of terrorism by US officials. Leaders of the Tablighi Jamaat have denounced Al-Qaeda. According to Alex Alexiev, \\"perhaps 80% percent of the Islamist extremists have come from Tablighi ranks, prompting French intelligence officers to call Tablighi Jamaat the 'antechamber of fundamentalism.'\\"Le Monde (Paris), 25 January 2002. Tablighi members who have been charged with terrorism include: Zacarias Moussaoui (charged in the United States in the 11 September attacks), Hervé Djamel Loiseau (French citizen found in Afghanistan), and Djamel Beghal (Algerian-born French citizen and Al Qaeda member who was convicted of plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris), Syed Rizwan Farook. In a foiled January 2008 bombing plot in Barcelona, Spain, \\"some media reports\\" stated that a Muslim leader in the city stated that the fourteen suspects arrested by police in a series of raids (where bomb-making materials were seized) were members of the Tablighi Jamaat. Other terrorist plots and attacks on civilians that members of Tablighi Jamaat have been connected with include the Portland Seven, the Lackawanna Six, the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, the 7/7 London bombings, the 2007 London car bombs, and 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack. According to the American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC), the Tablighi Jamaat teaches that jihad is \\"primarily as personal purification rather than as holy warfare\\". Because of its disavowal of violent jihad, the Tablighi activities have been banned in Saudi Arabia and some Islamist groups have accused the Tabligh of weakening support for jihad amongst Muslims. On the other hand, AFPC concludes, the group bears similarities with Islamist groups in that it adheres to strict Islamic norms and seeks to spread Islam to the whole world. The Tablighi Jamaat tried to expand the Abbey Mills Mosque into the largest mosque in the United Kingdom. The plan attracted controversy, and the Tabligh was denied permission. Many outside observers have described the group as \\"apolitical\\" at least in part because it avoids media and government notice, operates largely in secrecy, and has missionaries that lead austere lifestyles. Three western experts on Islam, for example, have described it as a: Another describes it as having an \\"apolitical stance\\" which Tablighi Jamaat is an extremely secretive group and the core of the group does not disclose how it operates. Despite claims of being apolitical, it has ties with the political and military sector of countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. In January 2016, in what was \\"probably the first time that any restriction has been placed on Tableeghi Jamaat\\" in Pakistan, the Punjab government banned preaching on university campuses, and banned Tableeghi Jamaat (and other non-students) from preaching and staying in campus hostels.\\"Punjab campus hostels out of bounds for Tableeghi Jamaat\\" , Dawn, 30 January 2016 =Forced conversions= In mid–May 2020, members of a Hindu family in the Sindh province of Pakistan were beaten by the Tablighi Jamaat members and threatened to convert to get their houses back. They demolished their home and abducted their son for refusing to convert to Islam. The mother of the abducted boy cried and begged the Jamaat to release her son. The Pakistan's Hindu community protested against the forced conversion. The Pakistan Hindu Council chief demanded an immediate inquiry from the government's minority council on the incident. Notable members The Tablighi Jamaat has no membership lists nor formal procedures for membership, which makes it difficult to quantify and verify affiliations. The former chief minister of the Pakistani province of Punjab, Pervaiz Elahi is also a strong supporter of the Tablighi Jamaat. During his tenure in 2011, 75 kanals of land (, ) were purchased for a Tablighi Jamaat mosque at the Raiwind Markaz. The cleric Tariq Jameel & Tariq Masood are prominent member of Tablighi Jamaat. The Former Pakistan Presidents- Farooq Leghari and Muhammad Rafiq Tarar were believed to be associated with the movement, the Indian president Dr Zakir Hussain was also affiliated with tabligh jammat Singers, actors and models, including Attaullah Essa Khailwi, Gulzar Alam, Bacha, Alamzeb Mujahid, are also affiliated with the movement. Former Lieutenant General and head of Inter-Services Intelligence Javed Nasir and General Mahmud Ahmed of the Pakistan Army both became members of Tablighi Jamaat during their service. The Tablighi Jamaat also has a notable following among Pakistani professional cricketers: Shahid Afridi, Mohammad (formerly \\"Youhana\\") Yousuf and the former cricketers Saqlain Mushtaq, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saeed Anwar and Saeed Ahmed are active members. Mohammad Yousuf's conversion from Christianity to Islam is widely attributed to the influence of the Tabligh Jamaat.

He was the son of Dyggvi, the former king. According to legend, he could understand the speech of birds and had a sparrow that gathered news for him from many lands. When the bird was killed on one of these trips, Dag invaded Reidgotaland (considering the date and location, apparently Gothiscandza), in order to avenge it. There he was ambushed by a thrall and killed. The earliest two versions based on Ynglingatal, i.e. Historia Norwegiæ and Íslendingabók (see below) say that Dag was succeeded by his sons Alrekr and Eírikr who in their turn were succeeded by Dag's grandson Agne (in Historia Norwegiæ incorrectly called HogneStorm, Gustav (editor) (1880).

This is what Snorri tells of Dag: {cellpadding=3  Dagr hét son Dyggva konungs, er konungdóm tók eptir hann; hann var maðr svá spakr, at hann skildi fugls rödd. Hann átti spörr einn, er honum sagði mörg tíðindi; flaug hann á ymsi lönd. Þat var eitt sinn, at spörrinn flaug á Reiðgotaland, á bœ þann, er á Vörva heitir; hann flaug í akr karls ok fékk þar matar. Karl kom þar ok tók upp stein ok laust spörrinn til bana. Dagr konungr varð illa við, er spörrinn kom eigi heim; gékk hann þá til sónarblóts til fréttar, ok fékk þau svör, at spörr hans var drepinn á Vörva. Síðan bauð hann út her miklum ok fór til Gotlands; en er hann kom á Vörva, gékk hann upp með her sinn ok herjaði: fólkit flýði víðs vegar undan.

Í þann tíma var sá höfðingi gramr kallaðr er herjaði, en hermennirnir gramir.Ynglinga saga at Norrøne Tekster og Kvad  style=\\"width:30px;\\"  King Dygve's son, called Dag, succeeded to him, and was so wise a man that he understood the language of birds. He had a sparrow which told him much news, and flew to different countries. Once the sparrow flew to Reidgotaland, to a farm called Varva, where he flew into the peasant's corn- field and took his grain. The peasant came up, took a stone, and killed the sparrow. King Dag was ill-pleased that the sparrow did not come home; and as he, in a sacrifice of expiation, inquired after the sparrow, he got the answer that it was killed at Varva. Thereupon he ordered a great army, and went to Gotland; and when he came to Varva he landed with his men and plundered, and the people fled away before him. King Dag returned in the evening to his ships, after having killed many people and taken many prisoners. As they were going across a river at a place called Skjotan's [the Weapon's] Ford, a labouring thrall came running to the river-side, and threw a hay- fork into their troop. It struck the king on the head, so that he fell instantly from his horse and died. In those times the chief who ravaged a country was called Gram, and the men-at-arms under him Gramer.  } Then Snorri quoted Ynglingatal (9th century): {  :Frák at Dagr :dauða orði :frægðar fúss :of fara skyldi, :þá er valteins :til Vörva kom :spakfrömuðr :spörs at hefna. :Ok þat orð :á austrvega :vísa ferð :frá vígi bar, :at þann gram :af geta skyldi :slöngviþref :Sleipnis verðar.  :What news is this that the king's men, :Flying eastward through the glen, :Report?

She was elected to this post on November 6, 2018 with more votes than any other candidate for Treasurer in the state's history. She served as a member of the California Board of Equalization from 2015 to 2019. Ma served in the California State Assembly (2006–2012) and on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (2002–2006). A member of the Democratic Party, Ma was the first Asian American woman to serve as California Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest-ranking office in the California Assembly. Ma is also only the second Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to be elected to the Board of Equalization. She was selected as Chairperson of the California Board of Equalization in 2016, ordered three external audits of the agency, and helped lead the biggest reforms for accountability and efficiency in that agency's history. Ma received more than 7.8 million votes in her election to become California's 34th Treasurer. She oversees more than $2 trillion of revenue running through the Treasurer's office every year. She stated her overarching goal is \\"to recognize the future and make sure it is distributed evenly.\\" Early life and education Ma is the oldest of three children born to William and Sophia Ma, both Chinese immigrants. Her grandfather, Lieutenant General Ma Zhen, was the first mayor of Kunming, Yunnan. Born and raised in New York, she attended Baker Elementary School before graduating from Great Neck North Middle and High Schools. Her father, Dr. William Ma, was a mechanical engineer who later specialized in construction claims and litigation before he retired. Her mother, Sophia (née Doo), was a high school art teacher for 20 years before moving the family to San Francisco to be closer to her parents. Rev William Doo was posted as a minister at the San Francisco Swatow Christian Church in San Francisco's Sunset District. Fiona Ma received a bachelor's degree in Accounting at Rochester Institute of Technology, a master's degree in Taxation from Golden Gate University, and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University. She is a CPA and member of the Aspen Institute's 2009 Class of Aspen-Rodel Fellows. Professional career In 1993 she worked at Ernst and Young, one of the \\"big six\\" accounting firms at the time. However, seeing few female managers and even fewer female partners during her time with the firm, she decided to start her own accounting practice with an associate. In 1994 Fiona Ma was elected president of the Asian Business Association, which led to her first involvement with politics, lobbying San Francisco City Hall and the Sacramento State Capitol for business issues that affected women and minorities. As a result of her work on behalf of the Small Business Association at that same time, she was elected in 1995 as a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business under President Bill Clinton. Fiona Ma's advocacy work in that role helped lead to socially responsible contracting for minorities and women in San Francisco, and produced a report to Congress on the 60 top policy recommendations to help small businesses grow and prosper in the 21st century. Ma is an active member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), California Society of Certified Public Accountants (CalCPA), Governmental Accounting Standards Advisory Council (GASAC). She was also a Hunt Keane Fellow in 2019, Cohort 6.  Early political career Ma was appointed to the Assessment Appeals Board of San Francisco by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1995. That same year, she started her public service career as a part-time district representative for then-State Senator John Burton. She served as John Burton's district representative until her election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 2002. She was responsible for helping constituents with Medi-Cal, Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Franchise and Employment Development Department taxes, and professional licensing.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  Ma was later elected to the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors from 2002 to 2006 representing District 4, the Sunset District, Outer Sunset, Parkside, Outer Parkside, and Pine Lake Park. While serving on that board, her major legislative push was a human rights campaign to shut down massage parlors who illegally trafficked persons into the country and used them to run illegal prostitution rings. Following the passage of Proposition 209, which barred public institutions from considering sex, race or ethnicity, she led the effort to create the city's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program to enable small businesses to more easily participate in public works projects, aiming to broaden the scope of inclusion. As a Supervisor, she also started her advocacy regarding banning toxins from children's toys - passing Ordinance Number 060107 to \\"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article…if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\\"Slow Death by Rubber Duck: How the Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Life Affects Our Health; Rick Smith, Bruce Lourie Random House Digital, Inc,2010  California Assembly  Ma with Don Korotsky Norte in 2009 Fiona Ma was first elected to represent California's 19th Assembly District from November 2006 to November 2012 (serving the maximum three terms). She was the 112th woman to be elected to the California legislature and the first Asian woman to serve as Speaker pro Tempore since 1850. Ma won the Democratic nomination to represent California's 19th Assembly District against fellow Democrat Janet Reilly in the state primary election of June 6, 2006. The campaign was one of the more expensive legislative primary races in the state of California. On November 7, 2006 Ma received 70 percent of the votes and defeated her two opponents for California Assembly, Republican Howard Epstein and Green Barry Hermanson. She replaced Leland Yee as 19th District assemblywoman. Her district included San Francisco, Daly City, Colma and Broadmoor, totaling some 420,000 constituents. Ma was appointed Assembly majority whip by the speaker of the assembly, Fabian Núñez, a position which she held for 4 years. As Majority Whip, she marshaled votes to ensure the passage of legislation that affected public education, expanded healthcare access, and set in place environmental protections. In 2010, Speaker of the Assembly John Pérez appointed Ma to the leadership position of Speaker pro Tempore, a position which she held for her final 2 years as the California Assembly. As presiding officer and member of the leadership team, Ma guided assembly members through the daily business of the house, responds to parliamentary inquiries, issues rulings on points of order when necessary, and is responsible for guiding legislative priorities. Ma presided over a record-breaking 18-hour session to pass California's budget. As an assemblywoman, Ma continued her work around toxic children's toys, authoring legislation banning toxic chemicals in products for babies and small children in assembly bill 1108. The bill came to be known as the \\"Rubber Duck Bill\\", so named because phthalates are often used in the manufacture of soft plastic toys and baby teethers. Arnold Schwarzenegger, then governor of California, signed the bill into law in October 2007; it took effect in January 2009. Ma's legislation was later incorporated into Senator Dianne Feinstein's federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 signed by President George W. Bush on August 15, 2008. She also worked on the creation of statewide high-speed rail, granting equal rights to men and women to change their last names when they are married or become domestic partners, and was a co-author of SB 840, a bill that would create a single payer universal health care system throughout California. = Committee membership = Standing committees: * Committee on Accountability and Administrative Review * Committee on Agriculture * Committee on Appropriations * Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism, and Internet Media * Committee on Business and Professions * Committee on Governmental Organization * Committee on Health * Committee on Higher Education * Committee on Housing and Community Development * Committee on Labor and Employment * Committee on Public Employees, Retirement and Social Security * Committee on Public Safety * Committee on Revenue and Taxation * Committee on Utilities and Commerce Select committees: * Chair, Select Committee on Domestic Violence * Select Committee on Alcohol And Drug Abuse * Select Committee on Foster Care * Select Committee on Preservation of California's Entertainment Industry * Select Committee on Rail Transportation * Select Committee on Regional Approaches To Addressing The State's Water Crisis * Select Committee on Safety And Protection Of At-Risk Communities In California Joint committees: * Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation, and Classification * Joint Committee for the Protection of Lake Tahoe California Board of Equalization On November 4, 2014, Ma won election to Board of Equalization district 2. She received 1,448,657 votes to win the election by 68.5% of the vote.http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-general/pdf/06-summary.pdf District 2 covers nearly 10 million people along California's coastline from Oregon to Santa Barbara. On, February 24, 2016, at the Board of Equalization (BOE) meeting in Culver City, the Board selected Ma as its chair.http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol- alert/article62469117.html As chair, Ma also sits on the California Franchise Tax Board.https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutFTB/boardMembers.shtml?WT.mc_id=AboutUs_BoardBiographies The California's Board of Equalization was created by voter initiative in 1879 to \\"equalize\\" property values/taxes. The board has broad regulatory and adjudicatory powers as a state tax board. The five-member Board meets monthly and is the only elected tax board in the country. The BOE administers more than 30 tax and fee programs. During fiscal year 2014–15, the BOE generated $60.5 billion of revenue. The BOE's monthly meetings offer taxpayers and other interested parties opportunities to participate in the formulation of rules and regulations adopted by the Board.http://www.boe.ca.gov California State Treasurer On May 17, 2016, Ma announced she was opening her campaign to run for California treasurer in the 2018 election. On June 5, 2018, she finished first in the nonpartisan open primary, and then defeated Republican Greg Conlon in the November 6 election receiving 7,825,587 votes – the most votes ever earned by a candidate for treasurer of California. On January 7, 2019, she was sworn in as the first woman of color and only the 2nd CPA to ever serve as California State Treasurer. In the Assembly, Ma was one of California's most powerful legislators, and as State Treasurer, she continued developing new laws and policies. In 2019 she sponsored 15 pieces of legislation, supported 25 bills, and provided technical support to 30 others, focusing on her priority areas of fiscal accountability, green financing, high-speed rail, affordable housing and consumer protections. =Head banker and strengthening state finances= As State Banker for California, Ma immediately put her stamp on how the state of California issues bonds. In her first year in office, Wall Street's Fitch Ratings and Moody's upgraded California's general obligation bonds, citing improved fiscal management, and stating California's budget reserves had \\"never been stronger\\". Ma stated her goal to help create \\"lower borrowing costs, a favorable interest rate environment, improved ratings, and a continued commitment to building reserves\\". In the first quarter of 2019, Ma sold more bonds than any other state treasurer in America, including a different bond issuance almost every week during March and April. From July to December of 2019, her office sold an additional $7.65 billion of bonds. In November 2019, the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst's Office reported on the Treasurer's cost- cutting impact stating: “the State Treasurer has been able to refinance much of the state’s bond debt. Consequently, much of the state’s outstanding debt now carries a lower interest rate resulting in lower annual costs.\\" Overall in 2019, Ma's office oversaw $85 billion in bonds and $85 billion to $100 billion (an all-time high) in short term investments. \\"I believe in checks and balances, accountability and also being proactive,\\" Ma told Bloomberg news. Ma's priorities for California's bond program include: * saving taxpayer's billions of dollars by refinancing at lowering interest rates * solving the housing crisis with more bonds allocated to affordable and low cost housing * green bonds that promote environmental benefits for the people of California * broadening efforts to include women, minority and veteran-owned broker-dealer firms to manage bond issuances * helping local city governments to manage their finances soundly * statewide infrastructure projects and voter approved bonds such as clean water and high-speed rail. =Green financing and environmental policy= Treasurer Ma chaired the inaugural meeting of the California Green Bond Market Development Committee on June 5, 2019 to “establish California as the world’s green bond leader” by developing standards for what qualifies as green bonds, and incorporating green bonds into the financing of state infrastructure projects. Ma launched the Small Business Energy Efficiency Financing and the Affordable Multifamily Energy Efficiency Financing programs in October 2019 to help small business, nonprofits and affordable housing owners to reduce the cost of financing energy efficiency improvements. She also co-sponsored the California Recycling Market Development Act to promote California's recycling programs, AB 1583 authored by Assemblymember Susan Eggman and signed in to law by Governor Newsom. Ma also chairs the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), which assists the state in meeting its greenhouse gas goals and works with the private market. CAEATFA operates the CA Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing Program, which has provided more than $825 million in sales tax exclusions for over 200 green projects that support solar manufacturing, geothermal, renewable fuels, and biogas production. Treasurer Ma also chairs the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA), providing $16.2 billion in low-cost innovative financing to California businesses since 1972 to make California more economically prosperous and environmentally clean. CPCFA was the first statewide financing authority to sign the Green Bond Pledge, vowing to meet climate bond principles in all of its projects. CPCFA awarded $73.7 million in tax-exempt green bond financing in 2019 to CalPlant I, LLC, a company that will turn rice straw into medium density fiberboard, employing 115 full- time workers, 450 part-time harvest-season workers, and supporting 325 construction jobs to build this first-of-a-kind project. =Affordable housing= Ma's Treasurer Office oversees private activity bonds (through the California Debt Limit AllocationCommittee - CDLAC) and state housing tax credits (though the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - CTCAC) that are used to build and maintain low-income housing and keep rents in these units affordable for 55 years. In 2019, her office sold over $180 million of bonds for the California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) program to provide affordable loans to veterans. Ma also sold $500 million in revenue bonds for California's No Place Like Home (NPLH) program, a groundbreaking California effort to develop permanent supportive housing for homeless and mentally ill persons. =Financial security and protections for consumers= In June 2019, Ma announced the official launch of the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program (CalSavers), which offers an IRA retirement savings option to employees who don't currently have one through their employer. The program also offers an option for self-employed “gig” workers who don't work as traditional employees. In October 2019, Ma announced that California's family college savings plan known as California's ScholarShare 529 had received a gold rating from Morningstar Inc, making it one of the four top college savings plan in the nation. In 2019, the “Scholar Dollars” program as part of ScholarShare 529 awarded more than $300,000 to 20 K-8 California public schools to fund technology, music, art, theater, computer science, sports, and other programs. As part of Governor Gavin Newsom's Master Plan for Aging, Ma co-sponsored three bills addressing the needs of older adults, people with disabilities and family caregivers: AB 1287 (Nazarian), AB 1382 (Aguiar-Curry), and SB 611(Cabellero). In 2019, the Treasurer Office's CalABLE program was expanded to allow anyone with a disability diagnosed before the age of 26 to open up an account and save up to $15,000 a year. =High-speed rail= In her first year as treasurer, Ma appointed Dr. Beverly Scott and Frederick Jordan to the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group.. Ma also gave a big boost to the So-Cal-to-Las Vegas XpressWest high-speed rail project connecting Southern California and Las Vegas, Nevada when she announced approval of a $300 million bond issuance for the project. The $4.8-billion, 170-mile long line running along Interstate 15 is slated to start construction in 2020 with trains running by 2023. “This is going to be the biggest shot in the arm that we have ever seen,” said Art Bishop, a councilman and former mayor in the San Bernardino County, California area, with an expected 600 permanent jobs generated and thousands of new homes in the region. =Cannabis banking= Ma continued her efforts to regulate the legal marijuana industry, and on February 13, 2019 she was the highest ranking government official to testify at the first U.S. Congressional hearing to authorize “safe-harbor” banking services for marijuana businesses located in states which have legalized marijuana use. Ma pointed out that “the cannabis market in California alone is expected to exceed $5.1 billion” by 2020, but federal roadblocks prevent those funds from going through the banking system. Those huge amounts of cash are untraceable and can lead to violent crimes like armed-robbery and other illicit activities. In addition, Ma pointed out that marijuana-related businesses are forced to pay employees in cash and therefore these employees are unable to pay into the Social Security system, unable to get car loans or home mortgages, and even unable to pay into alimony and child support.. In 2019, Ma sponsored SB 51, by Senator Majority Leader Bob Hertzberg, to allow private banks and credit unions to apply for state licensing which would allow licensed cannabis-related businesses to open accounts and deposit income. =Collecting sales tax revenue from Amazon= On April 25, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that Ma had pushed to require out-of-state and online retailers like eBay, Etsy, and Amazon to collect sales taxes in line with the practices of local brick and mortar California businesses, eliminating an unfair advantage that Amazon and other out-of-state and online businesses had claimed. Ma had championed such legislation when she sat on the Board of Equalization, and during her time in the California Assembly since 2007. = COVID-19 pandemic= During the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 2020, all Treasurer Ma's operations were considered essential services and kept fully open and operational. Ma’s office and agencies she chaired took the following actions: * assembled resources for taxpayer relief, food sources for needy families, and financial resources for small business. * Extended deadlines for business for the CalSavers retirement program and supported Governor Newsom and the State Franchise Tax Board in extending deadlines for California tax returns. * Launched $5 million emergency loan program for hospitals and health facilities in small, rural and district communities. * Increased bond money available to build additional 4,054 units of affordable housing including the first housing to target LGBT elders in the Davis region. * Pushed forward on $600 million in bonds for the Southern California to Las Vegas high speed rail project including 1,250 workforce housing units, 30,000 construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs. Oversight of coronavirus contracts By May 2020, California had spent $2.2 billion on safety gear to prevent coronavirus infection. No-bid contracts were used because of the emergency and unprecedented need for personal protective equipment. The state’s standard purchasing processes were disrupted and Treasurer Ma’s office, which normally just carries out final stages of financial transactions, took on an oversight role. “Not one dime – not one dime - of taxpayer dollars was lost,\\" testified Mark Ghilarducci, director of the state's Office of Emergency Services. Governor Newsom echoed these comments using the same words. In three noted transactions, the state was made whole for any expenditures: * Blue Flame Medical LLC - $495 million refunded to California after questions raised about reliability. * BYD Co. - 247.5 million of initial payment refunded due to delays in delivery. * Bear Mountain Development Co. LLC – $800 million contract cancelled; Bear Mountain only reimbursed for masks that were delivered. During legislative hearings about state procurement practices during the pandemic, Treasurer Ma pushed for more accountability. “Any measures that seek to create more transparency, especially in public contracting, I think is always the right course of action.” On April 15, 2020 Treasurer Fiona Ma defied both state and county health orders to shelter-in-place and social distancing guidelines by eating in at restaurant with staff members. Treasurer Ma posted pictures of the event to her Facebook page. The photos were later deleted.https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/04/15/coronavirus-state- treasurer-photo-sacramento-restaurant/  Personal life  She is married to Jason Hodge, a firefighter of Native American descent and an Oxnard Port Commissioner with the Port of Hueneme in Ventura County. Political positions = Business taxes = A top priority for Ma on the Board of Equalization has been to get everyone to pay “their fair share of taxes”, particularly “the $8 billion in unpaid taxes in the underground economy.” This has included efforts to get Amazon to collect sales tax on transactions from third-party sellers as a way of helping local brick-and-mortar retailers to compete – estimated at between $431 million and $1.8 billion in new revenue for California every year. In her first year, Ma also advocated for e-cigarettes to be taxed like tobacco products, as a way to deter vaping and smoking, and to pay for health-costs caused by tobacco use. Two years later in 2017, voters passed Prop. 56 with a nearly 2/3 majority, collecting $1.7 billion in new tobacco taxes which was spent on anti-smoking programs and funding Medi-Cal payments for the poor. Ma also identified the cannabis industry as “the largest shadow economy in California” with “hundreds of millions of dollars that disappear into an underground cannabis economy”. Her tireless efforts to regulate the industry, develop systems to “track and trace” all marijuana in California, and to develop legal banking mechanisms for marijuana businesses have earned her the nickname of “chief marijuana tax collector”. = Tax relief for citizens and small business = After 2015's Valley Fire in Lake County left four dead and nearly 2,000 buildings destroyed, Ma proposed a new law (enacted the following year) that granted some tax relief to businesses that suffer losses from a natural disaster like the Valley Fire. Ma has also actively supported California's Earned Income Tax Credit to give cash back to low-income individuals, and promoted expansion of the program to minimum wage earners and independent contractors. = Clean government reforms = Within months of joining the Board of Equalization, Ma became “very, very frustrated” with the agency's fiscal conditions and mishandling of state tax accounts. She called for the formation of an Auditing and Oversight Committee, and when she became Chairperson in 2016, initiated three external audits of the agency. The audits exposed a culture of mismanagement, nepotism and political use of state resources. Ma co-sponsored legislation to toughen campaign reporting requirements for BOE members. She then led the effort to ask the Governor to appoint a public trustee to take over the agency, and called on CA Attorney General Xavier Becerra to assign independent legal counsel for the agency. Ma laid out a list of reforms which was incorporated into the “Taxpayer Transparency and Fairness Act of 2017”, the biggest restructuring of the Board of Equalization in its 138-year history. The law was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in June 2017 and supported by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, Senate President Kevin de León, and former BOE member Controller Betty Yee. = Women and diversity = Ma continued her lifelong commitment to promoting women and diversity in public office. In 2016, she received Emerge California’s Woman of the Year Award and was a speaker at the Ascend Conference, the largest non-profit Pan-Asian business conference in America. Among her many other activities, Ma also celebrated Women's Equality Day at the Kelley House in Mendocino and spoke to students at the Future Chinese Leaders of America in Los Angeles. = Requiring consent to plastinate a corpse = On February 23, 2007, Ma introduced a bill which would have required commercial exhibitors of plastinated corpses to obtain a county permit, which would be dependent on proof of consent from the decedent or next of kin.\\"California Assembly approves legislation to ensure prior consent\\", by Marc Lifisher, Los Angeles Times. It passed the Senate on August 15, 2008 and was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on September 26, citing a budget delay that caused him to only sign bills \\"that are the highest priority for California. This bill does not meet that standard and I cannot sign it at this time.\\"Notice of veto, from Arnold Schwazenegger = Banning toxic chemicals = Fiona Ma has passed legislation banning toxic chemicals in plastics and children's toys. As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \\"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article…if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\\" This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit. As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys. Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008. = Hepatitis B awareness and prevention = At the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late. Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans. An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus. As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California. Fiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States. It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area. In 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B. She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California. = High-speed rail = Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high- speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail. = Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence = As the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system. A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed \\"The Sin by Silence Bills\\", inspired by the documentary Sin by Silence, into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute. AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports. =Non-profit and community involvement= Ma serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc. She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival. State and national outreach Assemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation. As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states. She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party. International outreach Since 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education. She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities. She has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.

Dyggvi died and became the concubine of Hel, Loki's daughter. Dyggvi was succeeded by his son Dag the Wise. According to Snorri Sturluson, Dyggvi was the nephew of Dan, the eponymous ancestor of Denmark, through his sister Drott, and was the first to be called King by his family.

All teams are competing in the top-flight Danish league in their respective sport. The kit sponsor for the club is Adidas, and the principal sponsor for the football team is the regional bank Spar Nord. AaB was founded on 13 May 1885 by English engineers who were building Jutland's railway system, and the first years was concentrated on the game of cricket. It was initially named Aalborg Cricketklub (Aalborg Cricket club) but the name of the club was changed to Aalborg Boldklub (Aalborg ballclub) in 1899. Football was adopted on an amateur basis in 1902, and has since been the main sport, as the name was changed to the current Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885 (Aalborg ballgameclub of 1885) in 1906.AaB at Onside.dk  Sections  = Professional =  Football  The club established a men's football team in 1902.

AaB became the first Danish team ever to participate in the UEFA Champions League Group Stage in 1995. AaB also qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League and qualified for the UEFA Cup in the same season after a 3rd-place finish in their Champions League group. Handball Handball was adopted by AaB in 2003, when the local men's team Aalborg HSH was bought and renamed AaB Håndbold (AaB handball). Since then, the club has played in the Danish top-flight handball league, though they have never won the league title. In May 2007, AaB published the plans to take over the women's handball team of Aalborg DH, as a part of the AaB Håndbold brand, as Aalborg DH did not pass a due diligence test, the takeover was never completed. With the expanded handball section, the men's team have moved their games to Aalborg DH's venue, Gigantium Arena. AaB Håndbold was owned by AaB A/S until January 2011. In January 2011 the license was given to the new company \\"Aalborg Håndbold A/S\\".

The Lejre Chronicle The Chronicle of Lejre (Chronicon Lethrense) written about 1170 introduces a primeval King Ypper of Uppsala whose three sons were Dan, who afterwards ruled Denmark, Nori, who afterwards ruled Norway, and Østen, who afterwards ruled the Swedes. Dan apparently first ruled in Zealand for the Chronicle states that it was when Dan had saved his people from an attack by the Emperor Augustus that the Jutes and the men of Fyn and Scania also accepted him as king, whence the resultant expanded country of Denmark was named after him. Dan's wife was named Dana and his son was named Ro. The Rígsthula The Eddic poem Rígsthula,http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Rigstula tells how the god Ríg (said to be Heimdall), fathered a mortal son named Jarl. Jarl had twelve sons with Erna Herse's daughter, the youngest of which bore the name Kon the Young (Old Norse Konr Ungr), this name understood to be the origin of the title konungr 'king', though the etymology is in fact untenable. One day, as he was hunting and snaring birds in the forest, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would gain more by going after men, and praised the wealth of \\"Dan and Danp\\". The poem breaks off incomplete at that point. The Skjöldungasaga According to Arngrímur Jónsson's Latin epitome of the lost Skjöldungasaga made in 1597: > Ríg (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time. He > married the daughter of a certain Danp [Old Norse Danpr], lord of Danpsted, > whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, > left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects > were called Danes. This tradition is close to that of the Rígsthula. This Dan married Olof the daughter of Wermund and so became brother-in-law to the Offa of Angel mentioned in the Old English poem Beowulf. Dan ruled first in Jutland but then conquered Zealand from King Aleif creating the kingdom of Denmark. Ynglinga saga Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga saga relates of King Dygvi of Sweden: > Dygvi's mother was Drótt, a daughter of King Danp, the son of Ríg, who was > first called konungr ['king'] in the Danish tongue [(Old Norse)]. His > descendants always afterwards considered the title of konungr the title of > highest dignity. Dygvi was the first of his family to be called konungr, for > his predecessors had been called dróttinn ['chieftain'], and their wives > dróttning, and their court drótt ['war band']. Each of their race was called > Yngvi, or Ynguni, and the whole race together Ynglingar. Queen Drótt was a > sister of King Dan Mikilláti, from whom Denmark took its name. Here Ríg is the father of Danp, the father of Dan. The title Mikilláti can be translated 'Magnificent' or 'Proud'. Snorri does not relate here whether this Dan is also descended from King Fridfrodi or Peace-Fróði whom Snorri presented as ruling in Zealand as a contemporary of Fjölnir son of Frey six generations before King Dygvi. Snorri writes further: > In the time when the kings we have been speaking of were in Uppsala, Denmark > had been ruled over by Dan Mikilláti, who lived to a very great age; then by > his son, Fróði Mikilláti, or the Peace-loving, who was succeeded by his sons > Halfdan and Fridleif, who were great warriors. This peaceful Fróði seems a duplicate of the earlier Fróði. In his preface to the Heimskringla (which includes the Ynglinga saga), Snorri writes: > The Age of Cairns began properly in Denmark after Dan Mikilláti had raised > for himself a burial cairn, and ordered that he should be buried in it on > his death, with his royal ornaments and armour, his horse and saddle- > furniture, and other valuable goods; and many of his descendants followed > his example. But the burning of the dead continued, long after that time, to > be the custom of the Swedes and Northmen. Sven Aagesen The 12th century historian Sven Aagesen mentions Danu Elatus 'the Proud' presumably, Dan Mikilláti, and makes him the successor to Uffi, that is to Offa son of Wermund, so agreeing with the Skjöldungasaga. He said that this Dan was so powerful a king that he had another king as his page and two nobles to hold his horse. The Gesta Danorum According Saxo Grammaticus Dan and Angul were brothers Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum presents three different Danish monarchs named Dan, either splitting up a single monarch into many or properly keeping separate what others have confused. Saxo begins his history with two brothers named Dan and Angul, sons of one Humbli, who were made rulers by the consent of the people because of their bravery. They were not however called \\"kings\\", as that usage was not then common. Angul is the eponym of the region of Angul and from his people eventually came the English who gave their name to England. Dan fathered two sons, Humblus and Lotherus, by his wife Grytha. Neither one is otherwise known, though a king named Humli is a leader of Huns in the Old Norse Battle of the Goths and Huns. Lotherus might have some relation to the Norse god Lóðurr or to the exiled king Heremod mentioned in Beowulf or to both. According to Saxo, Lotherus is the father of the famous hero Skioldus. The second king called Dan appears much later in Book 4, as the son of Uffi son of Vermund, (that is Offa of Angel son of Wermund). But Saxo passes over him in a few lines as a warlike king who scorned his subjects and wasted his wealth, much degenerated from his ancestors. He is followed by King Huglek, then Fróði the Active, who is then followed by the third Dan. Saxo does not specifically give the parentage of any of these kings. Of this Dan, Saxo relates only an anecdote that when Dan was twelve years old, tired of the arrogance of Saxon ambassadors who demanded tribute on pain of war, he bridged the river Elbe with ships, crossed over, and won a great victory. This Dan is the father of Fridlef father of Frothi, in whom one recognizes Fridleif and his son Fróði mentioned often in Norse sources, the latter being, at least by parentage, the Peace-Fróði whom Snorri introduced in the early in the Ynglinga saga. The Song of Eric The \\"Song of Eric\\" was once seen as a valuable source for Migration Period history, but is now regarded as inauthentic fakelore created during the 16th century. The ballad deals with Eric, the first king of Geatland (fyrsti konunger i Götalandinu vidha). He sent a troop of Geats southward to a country named Vetala, where no one had yet cultivated the land. In their company was a wise man who was to uphold the law. Finally, a king named Humli set his son Dan to rule the settlers, and after Dan, Vetala was named Denmark. The song was first published in a Latin translation in Johannes Magnus' Historia de omnibus gothorum sueonumque regibus (1554). He states that the original song was widely sung in Sweden at the time.

The first autumn, the Swedes sacrificed oxen at the temple at Uppsala, but the next harvest was not better. The second autumn, they sacrificed men, but the following crops were even worse. The third year many Swedes arrived at Gamla Uppsala at the Thing of all Swedes and the chiefs decided they had to sacrifice the king.

As in his time there was great famine and distress, the Swedes made great offerings of sacrifice at Upsalir. The first autumn they sacrificed oxen, but the succeeding season was not improved thereby. The following autumn they sacrificed men, but the succeeding year was rather worse. The third autumn, when the offer of sacrifices should begin, a great multitude of Swedes came to Upsalir; and now the chiefs held consultations with each other, and all agreed that the times of scarcity were on account of their king Domald, and they resolved to offer him for good seasons, and to assault and kill him, and sprinkle the stalle of the gods with his blood.

Biography =Early life= Hincmar was born in 806 to a distinguished family of the West Franks. Destined to the monastic life, he was brought up at Saint-Denis under the direction of the abbot Hilduin (died 844), who, when appointed court chaplain in 822, brought him to the court of the emperor Louis the Pious.Stone, Rachel, and Charles West.

When Hilduin was disgraced in 830 for having joined the party of Lothair I, Hincmar accompanied him into exile at Corvey in Saxony. Hincmar used his influence with the emperor on behalf of the banished abbot, and not without success: for he stood in high favour with Louis the Pious, having always been a faithful and loyal adherent. He returned with Hilduin to Saint-Denis when the abbot was reconciled with the emperor and remained faithful to the Louis during his struggle with his sons.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Hincmar.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. =840–877: reign of Charles the Bald= After the death of Louis the Pious (840) Hincmar supported Charles the Bald (see Capitularies of Charles the Bald), and received from him the abbacies of Nôtre-Dame at Compiègne and Saint-Germer-de- Fly. Archbishop of Reims (845) Archbishop Ebbo had been deposed in 835 at the synod of Thionville (Diedenhofen) for having broken his oath of fidelity to the emperor Louis, whom he had deserted to join the party of Lothair. After the death of Louis, Ebbo succeeded in regaining possession of his see for some years (840-844), but in 844 Pope Sergius II confirmed his deposition. In 845 Hincmar obtained through the king's support the archbishopric of Reims, and this choice was confirmed at the Synod of Beauvais (April 845). He was consecrated archbishop on 3 May 845; in 847 Pope Leo IV sent him the pallium. One of the first cares of the new prelate was the restitution to his metropolitan see of the domains that had been alienated under Ebbo and given as benefices to laymen. From the beginning of his episcopate Hincmar was in constant conflict with the clerks who had been ordained by Ebbo during his reappearance. These clerks, whose ordination was regarded as invalid by Hincmar and his adherents, were condemned in 853 at the Council of Soissons, and the decisions of that council were confirmed in 855 by Pope Benedict III. This conflict, however, bred an antagonism of which Hincmar was later to feel the effects. During the next thirty years the archbishop of Reims played a very prominent part in church and state. His authoritative and energetic will inspired, and in great measure directed, the policy of the West Frankish kingdom until his death. As a participant in government and court ceremony and an aggressive advocate of ecclesiastical privilegeCantor 1993, loc. cit., Hincmar took an active part in all the great political and religious affairs of his time, and was especially energetic in defending and extending the rights of the church and of the metropolitans in general, and of his own metropolitan of the church of Reims in particular. In the resulting conflicts, in which his personal interest was in question, he displayed great activity and a wide knowledge of canon law, but was not so scrupulous that he would not resort to disingenuous interpretation of texts. Gottschalk and predestinarianism His first encounter was with Gottschalk, whose predestinarian doctrines claimed to be modelled on those of St Augustine. Hincmar placed himself at the head of the party that regarded Gottschalk's doctrines as heretical, and succeeded in procuring the arrest and imprisonment of his adversary (849). For a part at least of his doctrines Gottschalk found ardent defenders, such as Lupus of Ferrières, Prudentius of Troyes, the deacon Florus, and Amolo of Lyons. Through the energy and activity of Hincmar the theories of Gottschalk were condemned at the second council of Quierzy (853) and Valence (855), and the decisions of these two synods were confirmed at the synods of Langres and Savonnières, near Toul (859). To refute the predestinarian heresy, Hincmar composed his De praedestinatione Dei et libero arbitrio, and against certain propositions advanced by Gottschalk on the Trinity he wrote a treatise called De una et non trina deitate. Gottschalk died in prison in 868. Lothar II of Lorraine The question of the divorce of Lothair II, king of Lorraine (r. 855–869), who had repudiated his wife Theutberga to marry his concubine Waldrada, engaged Hincmar's literary activities in another direction. At the request of a number of great personages in Lorraine he composed in 860 his De divortio Lotharii regis et Theutbergae reginae, in which he vigorously attacked, both from the moral and the legal standpoints, the condemnation pronounced against the queen by the Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle (February 860). Hincmar energetically supported the policy of Charles the Bald in Lorraine, less perhaps from devotion to the king's interests than from a desire to see the whole of the ecclesiastical province of Reims united under the authority of a single, sympathetic sovereign, and in 869 it was he who consecrated Charles at Metz as king of Lorraine. Episcopal conflicts In the middle of the ninth century there appeared in Gaul the collection of 'false decretals' commonly known as the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. The exact date and the circumstances of the composition of the collection are still an open question, but it is certain that Hincmar was one of the first to know of their existence, and apparently he was not aware that the documents were forged. The importance assigned by these decretals to the bishops and the provincial councils, as well as to the direct intervention of the Holy See, tended to curtail the rights of the metropolitans. Rothad, bishop of Soissons, one of the most active members of the party in favour of the pseudo-Isidorian theories, immediately came into collision with his archbishop. Deposed in 863 at the council of Soissons that was presided over by Hincmar, Rothad appealed to Rome. Pope Nicholas I, supported him zealously, and in 865, in spite of the protests of the archbishop of Reims, Arsenius, bishop of Orte and legate of the Holy See, was instructed to restore Rothad to his episcopal see. Hincmar experienced another check when he endeavoured to prevent Wulfad, one of the deposed clerics ordained by Ebbo, from obtaining the archbishopric of Bourges with the support of Charles the Bald. After a synod held at Soissons, Pope Nicholas I pronounced himself in favour of the deposed clerics, and Hincmar was constrained to submit (866). He was more successful in his contest with his nephew Hincmar, bishop of Laon, who was at first supported both by the king and by his uncle, the archbishop of Reims, but soon quarrelled with both. Hincmar of Laon refused to recognize the authority of his metropolitan, and entered into an open struggle with his uncle, who exposed his errors in a treatise called Opusculum LV capitulorum, and procured his condemnation and deposition at the Synod of Douzy (871). The bishop of Laon was sent into exile, probably to Aquitaine, where his eyes were put out by order of Count Boso. Pope Adrian protested against his deposition, but it was confirmed in 876 by Pope John VIII, and it was not until 878, at the council of Troyes, that the unfortunate prelate was reconciled with the Church. A serious conflict arose between archbishop Hincmar on the one side and Charles and the pope on the other in 876, when Pope John VIII, at the king's request, entrusted Ansegisus, archbishop of Sens, with the primacy of the Gauls and of Germany, and created him vicar apostolic. In Hincmar's eyes this was an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the archbishops, and it was against this primacy that he directed his treatise De iure metropolitanorum. At the same time he wrote a life of St Remigius, in which he endeavoured by audacious falsifications to prove the supremacy of the church of Reims over the other churches. Charles the Bald, however, upheld the rights of Ansegisus at the synod of Ponthion. =877–882: reigns of Louis the Stammerer, Louis III and Carloman= Relief from Hincmar's tomb, destroyed in 1793. Although Hincmar had been very hostile to Charles' expedition into Italy, he figured among his testamentary executors and helped to secure the submission of the nobles to Louis the Stammerer, whom he crowned at Compiègne (December 8, 877). During the reign of Louis, Hincmar played an obscure part. He supported the accession of Louis III and Carloman, but had a dispute with Louis, who wished to install a candidate in the episcopal see of Beauvais without the archbishop's assent. To Carloman, on his accession in 882, Hincmar addressed his De ordine palatii, partly based on a treatise (now lost) by Adalard, abbot of Corbie (c. 814), in which he set forth his system of government and his opinion of the duties of a sovereign, a subject he had already touched in his De regis persona et regio ministerio, dedicated to Charles the Bald at an unknown date, and in his Instructio ad Ludovicum regem, addressed to Louis the Stammerer on his accession in 877. In the autumn of 882 an irruption of the Normans forced the old archbishop to take refuge at Épernay, where he died on 21 December 882. Theological work Hincmar was a prolific writer. Besides the works already mentioned, he was the author of several theological tracts; of the De villa Noviliaco, concerning the claiming of a domain of his church; and he continued from 861 the Annales Bertiniani, of which the first part was written by Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, the best source for the history of Charles the Bald. He also wrote a great number of letters, some of which are extant, and others embodied in the chronicles of Flodoard. Hincmar's works, which are the principal source for the history of his life, were collected by Jacques Sirmond (Paris, 1645), and reprinted by Migne, Patrol. Latina, vol. cxxv and cxxvi.

History The brand was launched in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters. It was originally used as an advertising gimmick when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935. Until the late 1950s, Parliaments were packaged in a two-layer \\"hard\\" pack. That packaging continued under the Benson & Hedges brand after Parliament adopted a conventional paper pack. Parliaments are one of few brands of cigarettes on the mainstream market to feature a recessed paper filter. Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was marketed for its unique filters, with advertisements reading, \\"Only the flavor touches your lips\\", and \\"Tobacco tastes best when the filter's recessed\\". The brand also claimed that the recessed filter prevented tar from making contact with the smoker's mouth, unlike standard filters. However, this recess would also explain the popularity of the cigarette in another way: the sleeve would be suitable for snorting cocaine. In Korea, brands like Marlboro , Philip Morris, Dunhill, Parliaments and various other Western cigarettes were sold in 1987 as import opening to prepare for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Parliament make up 1.9% of U.S. cigarette sales, in contrast to Marlboro, which represent 41.1% of the U.S. cigarette sales. From the 1950s on the cigarette had a reputation for being popular among affluent smokers. It is the 12th best- selling international brand and the 4th largest PMI brand. In 2016, the volume of produced Parliament cigarettes was 46 billion. The brand is sold in more than 30 countries. Advertising In the television commercials that were once broadcast in Japan, the image of New York was strongly issued. From the early to the mid 1980s, things like CG animation, which had been the package designs of Parliament, ranged from the cityscape of New York to roads and bridges, etc. From around the end of the 1980s, the aerial photographs of New York by live action turned into things to be used. Since entering the 1990s, under the image strategy of being even more expensive, BGM was shedding the number of AOR artists such as Bobby Caldwell with beautiful images. Among them were included a self-cover version by Bobby of \\"Stay With Me\\" for KA, GU, YA (the theme song of the movie Bamboo Story) that was offered to Peter Cetera. Kyōzō Nagatsuka was in charge of the narration at that time. Actor Charlie Sheen appeared in ads for Parliament in Japan in the 1990s. In popular culture =Novels= Parliament cigarettes appeared in the 1956 James Bond novel Diamonds Are Forever. Ian Fleming specifically mentions the brand with the line \\"She (Tiffany Case) picked up her third Martini and looked at it. Then very slowly, in three swallows, she drank it down. She put down the glass and took a Parliament out of the box beside her plate and bent towards the flame of Bond’s lighter.\\". Parliaments were also mentioned in the 1962 Bond novel The Spy Who Loved Me. The brand is referenced when Vivienne Michel enjoys a Parliament while settling in for her planned evening alone. \\"Then I pulled the most comfortable armchair over from the reception side of the room to stand beside the radio, turned the radio up, lit a Parliament from the last five in my box, took a stiff pull at my drink, and curled myself into the armchair.\\" =Music= *Musician George Clinton named his groups The Parliaments and Parliament respectively after the cigarette brand. *Regina Spektor 2006 song \\"That Time\\" *Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke Parliaments *Lana Del Rey 2014 song \\"West Coast\\" *I can see my baby swinging, his Parliament's on fire and his hands are up *Ghostemane 2018 song \\"My Heart of Glass\\" *Of the Parliament I said that I would quit but I can't *Cal Scruby 2020 song \\"Bad Guy\\" =Acting/Variety Show= Actress Keiko Awaji was a Parliament smoker.

They are useful for decomposition of Haken manifolds, normal surface theory, and studying fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.  Formal definition  irreducible. Let S be a compact surface properly embedded in a smooth or PL 3-manifold M. A compressing disk D is a disk embedded in M such that : D \\\\cap S = \\\\partial D and the intersection is transverse. If the curve ∂D does not bound a disk inside of S, then D is called a nontrivial compressing disk. If S has a nontrivial compressing disk, then we call S a compressible surface in M. If S is neither the 2-sphere nor a compressible surface, then we call the surface (geometrically) incompressible. Note that 2-spheres are excluded since they have no nontrivial compressing disks by the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, and 3-manifolds have abundant embedded 2-spheres. Sometimes one alters the definition so that an incompressible sphere is a 2-sphere embedded in a 3-manifold that does not bound an embedded 3-ball. Such spheres arise exactly when a 3-manifold is not irreducible. Since this notion of incompressibility for a sphere is quite different from the above definition for surfaces, often an incompressible sphere is instead referred to as an essential sphere or a reducing sphere.  Compression  Compressing a surface S along a disk D results in a surface S', which is obtained by removing the annulus boundary of N(D) from S and adding in the two disk boundaries of N(D). Given a compressible surface S with a compressing disk D that we may assume lies in the interior of M and intersects S transversely, one may perform embedded 1-surgery on S to get a surface that is obtained by compressing S along D. There is a tubular neighborhood of D whose closure is an embedding of D × [-1,1] with D × 0 being identified with D and with :(D\\\\times [-1,1])\\\\cap S=\\\\partial D\\\\times [-1,1]. Then :(S-\\\\partial D\\\\times(-1,1))\\\\cup (D\\\\times \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\}) is a new properly embedded surface obtained by compressing S along D. A non-negative complexity measure on compact surfaces without 2-sphere components is b0(S) − χ(S), where b0(S) is the zeroth Betti number (the number of connected components) and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic. When compressing a compressible surface along a nontrivial compressing disk, the Euler characteristic increases by two, while b0 might remain the same or increase by 1. Thus, every properly embedded compact surface without 2-sphere components is related to an incompressible surface through a sequence of compressions. Sometimes we drop the condition that S be compressible. If D were to bound a disk inside S (which is always the case if S is incompressible, for example), then compressing S along D would result in a disjoint union of a sphere and a surface homeomorphic to S. The resulting surface with the sphere deleted might or might not be isotopic to S, and it will be if S is incompressible and M is irreducible.  Algebraically incompressible surfaces  There is also an algebraic version of incompressibility. Suppose \\\\iota: S \\\\rightarrow M is a proper embedding of a compact surface in a 3-manifold. Then S is π1-injective (or algebraically incompressible) if the induced map :\\\\iota_\\\\star: \\\\pi_1(S) \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi_1(M) on fundamental groups is injective. In general, every π1-injective surface is incompressible, but the reverse implication is not always true. For instance, the Lens space L(4,1) contains an incompressible Klein bottle that is not π1-injective. However, if S is two-sided, the loop theorem implies Kneser's lemma, that if S is incompressible, then it is π1-injective. Seifert surfaces A Seifert surface S for an oriented link L is an oriented surface whose boundary is L with the same induced orientation. If S is not π1 injective in S3 − N(L), where N(L) is a tubular neighborhood of L, then the loop theorem gives a compressing disk that one may use to compress S along, providing another Seifert surface of reduced complexity. Hence, there are incompressible Seifert surfaces. Every Seifert surface of a link is related to one another through compressions in the sense that the equivalence relation generated by compression has one equivalence class. The inverse of a compression is sometimes called embedded arc surgery (an embedded 0-surgery). The genus of a link is the minimal genus of all Seifert surfaces of a link. A Seifert surface of minimal genus is incompressible. However, it is not in general the case that an incompressible Seifert surface is of minimal genus, so π1 alone cannot certify the genus of a link. Gabai proved in particular that a genus-minimizing Seifert surface is a leaf of some taut, transversely oriented foliation of the knot complement, which can be certified with a taut sutured manifold hierarchy. Given an incompressible Seifert surface S for a knot K, then the fundamental group of S3 − N(K) splits as an HNN extension over π1(S), which is a free group. The two maps from π1(S) into π1(S3 − N(S)) given by pushing loops off the surface to the positive or negative side of N(S) are both injections.

The film, which was directed by Richard Attenborough, is based on a screenplay by William Goldman, who also wrote the novel upon which it was based. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.  Plot  After Charles \\"Corky\\" Withers fails in his first attempt at professional magic, his mentor \\"Merlin\\" (E. J. André) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats, becoming a huge success. Corky's powerful agent, Ben Greene, is on the verge of signing him for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \\"afraid of success.\\" In truth, Corky does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe mental issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). In the Catskills, Corky reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peggy into thinking they are soulmates, leading to them having sex. This sparks the jealousy not only of Duke but also the dummy Fats. In the midst of an argument \\"between\\" Corky and Fats, Greene arrives unexpectedly and confronts Corky, discovering the truth about Corky's state of mind. Corky pleads that nothing is wrong with him and that he is just rehearsing, so Greene puts him to the test, saying \\"Make Fats shut up for 5 minutes.\\" Corky puts aside Fats, but is unable to last 5 minutes without delivering a rapid stream of speech through Fats. Greene demands that Corky get help, and leaves to make some calls to doctors, but Fats convinces Corky to kill his agent. Corky chases after Greene in the woods and bludgeons him with Fats' hard, wooden head, and then attempts to drag the body into a lake. However, a still-living Greene suddenly lunges at him, causing Corky to drown him. The next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to elope with Peggy and leave the dummy behind. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. Suspecting his wife has cheated on him, he wants to have a talk with Corky by the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots Greene's body on the edge of the lake. Duke, believing Greene could still be alive, sends Corky to get help. Curious, he decides to search Corky's cabin, where Fats stabs him with \\"help\\" from Corky. An increasingly deranged Corky manages to pull himself together and persuade Peggy to run away with him. But she insists on waiting to tell Duke face to face. She thinks everything is fine until Fats \\"comes alive\\" and reveals that Corky's card trick is only a ruse he uses to seduce women, and that Peggy is only the latest of his conquests. Repulsed, she rejects Corky and locks herself in her bedroom. Fats says that, from this point on, he will make the decisions in Corky's life, immediately asserting this new authority by ordering Corky to kill Peggy. Corky, turning on the charm and using Fats' voice, apologizes to Peggy through her locked door, and leaves her a wooden heart that he carved. A short while later, Corky returns with a bloodstained knife. Fats seems pleased — until it is revealed that the blood on the knife is Corky's, who has fatally stabbed himself so that he won't kill anyone else. As a result, Fats also feels faint. They wonder which of them will die first. Moments later, Peggy returns to their cabin, happily calling out that she has changed her mind and has decided to run away with Corky after all. As she speaks, she playfully changes her voice to impersonate Fats.

Laurence Olivier was originally offered the role of the agent but was unable to do it so Burgess Meredith was cast instead. Meredith got the role after walking into 21 one night when Joe E. Levine was there - Levine cast him on the spot. Meredith modelled his performance on the agent Swifty Lazar, even shaving his head to look like Lazar. \\"I tried to get his cool, understated manner, his sharp clothes and, most of all, his way of speaking softly so that you've got to lean over to hear what he's saying\\", said Meredith. Goldman later wrote about the film that \\"Burgess Meredith was perfect and Tony Hopkins... was so wonderful here. But running stride for stride with him was Miss Olsson.

However, The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review 1990 writeup of the film remarks that Hopkins appears stiff in the lead role, but praised the supporting cast: \\"Ann- Margret...invests her role with a considerable sparkle.

The complete soundtrack was released on CD through Varèse Sarabande in April, 2003 and features twenty-two tracks score at a running time of forty-two minutes. It was subsequently reissued by La-La Land Records.  Home media  As 20th Century Fox never owned complete rights to this film (the studio did and still does own the theatrical distribution and music rights), other companies (especially Embassy and nowadays MGM) have been able to release home video versions of Magic under different licenses. However, subsequent legal complications kept the film from being formally reissued on VHS and DVD in the last decade due in part to Embassy Pictures' corporate holdings being divided amongst different entities. Recently the rights were acquired by the American Movie Classics division of AMC Film Holdings, LLC, while TV rights are handled for syndication by Trifecta Entertainment & Media (under Paramount Pictures). An uncut version is currently available on widescreen DVD and Blu-ray.  In popular culture  In 2010, the BBC Radio 4 satirical comedy series The Now Show claimed that Michael Gove looked like a scary ventriloquist puppet.

In 2002–03 the club finished as runners-up and promoted alongside fellow Israeli-Arab club Maccabi Ahi Nazareth, becoming the joint- second Israeli-Arab club to play in the top flight after Hapoel Tayibe. Promotion was only won on the last day of the season, the club overtaking Hapoel Jerusalem when they won 1–0 away to Maccabi Kiryat Gat, whilst Hapoel were held to a 0–0 draw at Hapoel Ra'anana. Prior to their first season in the top division, Sakhnin were favourites to be relegated, and it was thought that Nazareth had a better chance of survival. Questions remained as to whether the squad that gained promotion would be able to compete at the top level, along with the added pressures not to become the next Hapoel Taibe (who were relegated in their first season in the top flight, and subsequently suffered financial problems leading to repeated relegations thereafter). They also lost manager Momy Zafran who resigned shortly after the club won promotion, replacing him with Eyal Lahman. In addition, the club had to play games in Haifa's Kiryat Eliezer Stadium, as their home ground in Sakhnin was deemed unfit for the Premier League. =Later successes= The club signed former Maccabi Haifa striker Raffi Cohen and loaned another striker, Lior Asulin from Maccabi Herzliya. Sagi Strauss was brought in to mind the nets from Maccabi Petah Tikva. Despite the gloomy predictions, the club defied the odds, eventually finishing 10th, four points clear of relegation, whilst Nazareth finished bottom. However, the highlight of the season was the State Cup victory, also a first by an Israeli-Arab club. In the final, Sakhnin beat surprise finalists, second division side Hapoel Haifa 4–1. The team gained a reputation for being a tough, combative outfit, similar in style to the Crazy Gang period at English club Wimbledon. Captain and club stalwart Abbas Suan (he had been at the club since its formation, having been part of the Hapoel Sakhnin team since 1994) won particular acclaim, gaining a call-up to the Israel squad, and winning his first cap in February 2004. The cup win meant that the club became the first Arab team to play in Europe, entering the UEFA Cup. After beating Partizani Tirana 6–1 on aggregate in the second qualifying round, the club faced Newcastle United in the first round. However, Sakhnin were beaten 7–1 on aggregate, including a 5–1 home defeat in a match played at the Ramat Gan Stadium in Ramat Gan due to security concerns. During the 2004–05 season, with its stadium still under development the club played many of its home matches at Hapoel Nazareth Illit's Municipal Stadium. The Doha Stadium was funded in part by Qatar and was opened in 2006 During their spell in the top flight, several Sakhnin games were plagued by hooliganism. Despite chairman Ghnaim's stated mission to create a \\"cultural rainbow\\" from his football club, games against Beitar Jerusalem were particularly violent, at least partially due to the presence of notoriously anti-Arab supporters of Beitar;Spurs Legend On Life At Racist Israeli Club Sky News, 6 October 2006 when Sakhnin won the State Cup, Beitar fans paid for an obituary to be printed in Israel's leading daily Yediot Aharonot, claiming that Israeli football was dead. On 29 January 2005 Sakhnin fans rioted during a home match (played at Kiryat Eliezer) against Hapoel Tel Aviv after a violent incident on the field between a team official and a referee, who had earlier had sent off two Sakhnin players. As a punishment, the IFA ordered the club to play two games behind closed doors. Despite a large cash injection made by Israeli businessman Arcadi Gaydamak ($400,000) in the hope of promoting peace and harmony among the citizens of Israel,Soccer: In Israel and Italy, storied teams rise International Herald Tribune, 15 April 2007 and a return to their rebuilt home stadium (largely financed by the Emir of Qatar, hence the renaming to Doha Stadium), Sakhnin were relegated at the end of 2005–06 season, finishing nine points from safety. However, with one of the largest budgets in the division (around five and a half million shekels), the club were amongst the favourites to return quickly to the Premier League, and did so by finishing as runners-up to Kiryat Shmona. In their first season back in the Premier League, they finished fourth, their highest ever league position, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup. Problems due to political unrest in the region, did that leaders in the club asked to postpone matches in Intertoto cup in the Summer of 2008, Most of the stars of the team were sold, most notably Maor Buzaglo who signed for Maccabi Tel Aviv. The club's 2019-20 season started off painfully, with the first match ending in a home 3-0 loss to Bnei Yehuda. The next week, some of the team's players and managing team had to quarantine as a result of covid-19 pandemic precautions, and they played their away match against Maccabi Netanya with a lacking roster and no coach. After suffering a 7-0 loss, the greatest defeat in the club's history, the Sakhnin chairman left the administrative division of Ligat Ha'al. In popular culture The rise of the Bnei Sakhnin F.C. was the subject of a popular documentary film by noted Israeli director Ram Loevy. The team is also the subject of the critically acclaimed 2010 documentary film \\"After The Cup: Sons of Sakhnin United\\", which follows the team after they win the Israel State Cup directed by American Christopher Browne. Sponsorship During the 2005–06 season, the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with Israeli mobile phone company Cellcom. Talks are currently ensuing over continuing the deal even though the chief executive of Cellcom's Arab sector affairs, Suliman Diab, has left his non-executive post with Bnei Sakhnin to join Liga Artzit (third tier) side Bnei Tamra. The club's budget was bolstered on 15 June 2006 when Gaydamak announced that he would donate two million shekels to the club in hope that they will make a return to Israel's top league. Support The fan base of Bnei Sakhnin is smaller in comparison to other Israeli clubs. The majority of fans of Bnei Sakhnin are Arab Israelis. The Bnei Sakhnin fan club is called Ultras Sakhnin 2003 (US03) or Duha Gate 4–5 (named due to the gate numbers that leads to their stand), it was established in 2003 after they promoted to the top division. Other fan clubs that they have friendship with is Ultras Hapoel 99 fans of Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C., Ultrà Sankt Pauli 2002 of FC St. Pauli and Ultras Winners 2005 of Wydad Casablanca. Big matches (especially those against rival club Beitar Jerusalem) can attract large crowds but toward the end of the 2005–06 season when the club was set to be relegated, the attendance at matches declined dramatically. The peak of fan attendance was the Israel State Cup final when Ramat Gan Stadium was filled with Arabs from Israel who had all come to support the club. Players =Current squad= =Foreigners (2020–21)= Only up to six non-Israeli nationals can be in an Israeli club squad. Those with Jewish ancestry, married to an Israeli, or have played in Israel for an extended period of time (e.g. Gustavo Boccoli), can claim a passport or permanent residency which would allow them to play with Israeli status. * Emery Welshman * Ikouwem Utin Club officials *Owner: Fawzi Hameed *Chief executive: Shlomi Goldstein *Manager: Abdul Aziz Bashir Managers * Azmi Nassar (1999–00) * Momi Zafran (2002–2005) * Eyal Lahman (2003–2005) * Momi Zafran (2005) * Michael Kadosh (2005–2006) * Elisha Levy (July 1, 2006 – June 30, 2008) * Freddy David (July 1, 2008 – 2008) * Eyal Lahman (2008–09) * Eran Kulik (2009 – Oct 19, 2009) * Marco Balbul (Oct 21, 2009 – June 30, 2010) * Yuval Naim (July 1, 2010 – Aug 11, 2010) * Haim Levy (2010) * Slobodan Drapić (2010–11) * Shlomi Dora (April 4, 2011 – March 10, 2013) * Marco Balbul (March 11, 2013 – June 19, 2014) * Guy Levy (June 19, 2014) * Eli Cohen (born 1961) (2014–2015) * Yossi Abuksis (2015–2017) * Jairo Swirsky (2017) * Aiman Khalaila (caretaker) (2017) * Felix Naim (2017) * Tal Banin (2018) * Benny Ben Zaken (2018) * Amir Turgeman (2018-2019) * Giorgi Daraselia (2019) * Eldad Shavit (2019) * Nissan Yehezkel (2019) Titles * State Cup (1): 2003-04 * Toto Cup (0), runners-up (1): 2020-21 Records *Most League Goals: 31 Ahmed Kasoum,(2003–2006)&(2009–2014) *Most League Goals in a Season (individual): 16 Oren Muharer, Liga Leumit, 2000–01 *Most Goals scored in a match: 3 Samir Zampir v SK Nes Ziona, 6 March 1999 / 3 Wissam Isami v Hapoel Bat Yam, 21 May 1999 / 3 Oren Muharer v Hapoel Jerusalem, 31 October 1999 / 3 Shlomi Azulay v Maccabi Haifa, 02 April 2016 / 3 Shlomi Azulay v Beitar Jerusalem, 01 May 2016 *Most League Goals in a Season (team): 60 2011/12 References Sakhnin Category:Association football clubs established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Israel ","title":"Bnei Sakhnin F.C."},{"id":"896192","text":"Golan Cipel (born 1968) is an Israeli consultant most known for his intention for filing a sexual harassment lawsuit against New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, an action that led to McGreevey's decision to resign as governor. Biography Cipel was born in Tel Aviv in 1968 and grew up in the city of Rishon LeZion.Golan Cipel's official web site Cipel served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for five years as a naval officer, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant. Following his service in the Israeli Navy, Cipel held several positions in government. He began his career in 1992 as parliamentary aide in the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, where he was responsible for policy formation, as well as the drafting of legislation. In 1994 he joined the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as chief information officer at the Consulate General of Israel in New York, where he was responsible for presenting the Israeli government perspective to the American media and public. In 1999, Cipel was appointed the spokesperson for the municipality of Rishon LeZion, Israel. In 2001, Cipel returned to the United States to work on the New Jersey gubernatorial campaign of Jim McGreevey. Following the election, Cipel was appointed counselor to the governor, advising McGreevey on issues including political strategy, diplomatic affairs and Jewish community relations. He also served as liaison between the states's various security and law enforcement agencies and the governor's office. Cipel currently works as an independent marketing consultant. He holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in communications arts from the New York Institute of Technology. Relationship with McGreevey McGreevey met Cipel while on a junket to Israel in 2000. Cipel was working as a public affairs officer for a municipal government. Cipel later moved to New Jersey in order to provide outreach to the Jewish community on behalf of McGreevey's gubernatorial campaign. McGreevey eventually appointed Cipel as a counselor to the governor, a position from which he resigned in August 2002 to take a position at the public relations firm MWW. Cipel's intention to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against McGreevey in Mercer County Court led to McGreevey's decision to resign as governor on August 12, 2004. Cipel dropped the lawsuit after McGreevey resigned, stating that justice had been served. =Cipel's version= In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz (August 19, 2004), Cipel stated that his situation was intentionally misrepresented by the governor's office and affirmed that he had never actually been responsible for internal security under the governor. According to Cipel, the press had distorted his history, transforming him from someone who had self-published a book of poetry at age sixteen into a \\"poet\\". He claims such distortions supported the story that McGreevey allegedly created and the press eagerly covered. In his own words, Cipel claims he was one of many victims of McGreevey's sexual harassment, that he had \\"no romantic affair\\" with the governor, but rather was taken advantage of. He also describes the former governor's behavior as egotistical, unprofessional, immoral, and immature.

The installation occupies about of waterfront space and of pier and wharf space of the Hampton Roads peninsula known as Sewell's Point. It is the world's largest naval station, with the largest concentration of U.S. Navy forces through 75 ships alongside 14 piers and with 134 aircraft and 11 aircraft hangars at the adjacently operated Chambers Field.History of Naval Station Norfolk Port Services controls more than 3,100 ships' movements annually as they arrive and depart their berths. Air Operations conducts over 100,000 flight operations each year, an average of 275 flights per day or one every six minutes. Over 150,000 passengers and 264,000 tons of mail and cargo depart annually on Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft and other AMC-chartered flights from the airfield's AMC Terminal. History docked at then–NOB Norfolk in October 1937 The area where the base is located was the site of the original 1907 Jamestown Exposition. In 1915, the Headquarters of the 5th Naval District was established. In April 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, a bill was passed for the purchase of the land, and money was set aside in the amount of $1.6 million for the development of the base. The Naval Operating Base (NOB) and other facilities were established. By 1918, there were 34,000 enlisted men at the base. However, by the war's end, the base was reduced in personnel and put into a \\"standby mode.\\" and at NS Norfolk in 1954. When World War II began in Europe in 1939, the base became more active again. New facilities were built, including new runways for aircraft, part of Naval Air Station Norfolk. It also had ramps built to be used by seaplanes to be operated by the Navy during the war. About 400 acres was acquired and, by 1943, the air station had become a central airfield for operations. Due to the expansion, it contributed to ending the war because of the training it provided to naval air units. In March 1946, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered the Commandant of the 5th Naval District to place NOB Norfolk and NAS Norfolk as separate installations under the command of Commandant Naval Base, whose title was soon changed to Commander, Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic. Following World War II, NOB Norfolk became the primary base of the Atlantic Fleet. It was one of the largest naval bases in the world. On 1 January 1953, the name of the naval base was officially changed to Naval Station Norfolk (NS Norfolk), after being known as the NOB. In 1968, the Naval Air Station was given a major role in John F. Kennedy's vision of putting a man on the moon. The air station became Recovery Control Center Atlantic, which provided command, control, and communications for the ships and aircraft that participated in the recovery operations of Apollo 7. Due to the end of the Cold War, a drawdown began in the 1990s, and the Navy began reducing shore installations to help with operating costs. Due to this, the Navy merged the separate Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Air Station Norfolk into a single installation to be called Naval Station Norfolk, which became official on 5 February 1999. Following the attack on USS Cole and 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, the base had some major upgrades to its security gates, costing more than $12.5 million. On 26 January 2017, NS Norfolk celebrated its centennial at the Pennsylvania House, an historical building built for the Jamestown Exposition, located on the base. Incidents On Easter (3 April) of 1988, members of the anti-nuclear group Plowshares boarded the battleship with visitors for a ship's tour and left their group to do symbolic damage to the ship's empty Tomahawk missile launchers, using hammers and their own blood. On March 24, 2014, a shooting at NS Norfolk resulted in the death of a Sailor and a civilian. The shooting occurred around 11:20 p.m. EDT aboard . Security forces shot and killed the civilian who had allegedly shot the Sailor aboard the vessel. The base was closed for a short time after the shooting on USS Mahan. Operational Units Naval Station Norfolk is home port of four carrier strike groups and their assigned ships. In addition, the Naval Station plays host to several Military Sealift Command ships, as well as the submarines of the Atlantic Fleet. As of June 2017, the following operational units are headquartered or homeported at Naval Station Norfolk: = Carrier Strike Groups (CARSTRKGRU)= * Carrier Strike Group Two * Carrier Strike Group Eight * Carrier Strike Group Ten * Carrier Strike Group Twelve = Destroyer Squadrons (DESRONS)= * Destroyer Squadron 2 * Destroyer Squadron 28 * Destroyer Squadron 26 * Destroyer Squadron 22 =Submarine Squadron (SUBRON)= * Submarine Squadron 6 = Aircraft carriers =   = Cruisers =  * * † * † * † * † * = Submarines =   * * = Military sealift command =     * * † undergoing service life extension  Air Squadrons  Tenant/Shore Commands In addition to the several operational units, Naval Station Norfolk is also headquarters to a number of shore activities that provided administrative and specialty support to regional operational assets, and in some cases, the entire Navy.

Early life Caley was born in Craven, Yorkshire, England, the son of a horse-dealer. He was educated at the Free Grammar School at Manchester for around four years and was then taken into his father's stables. Coming across a volume on farriery, he became interested in the herbs mentioned in prescriptions and this led to his teaching himself botany. He changed his job to that of a weaver in order to allow himself more time for study and, with the encouragement of the noted botanist, Dr William Withering (1744-1799), he became associated with the Manchester School of Botanists. In March 1795 he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks who, after warning him about the small financial rewards to be expected by a botanist for his labour, suggested that he might be able to obtain work for him as a gardener's labourer, which would give opportunities of increasing his knowledge. He worked in Kew Gardens and other gardens. Australia Caleana, the Flying Duck Orchid, named after George Caley Banks appointed Caley as a botanical collector in New South Wales in 1798. He was given a free passage to Sydney aboard the Speedy, where he arrived on 15 April 1800. He was paid weekly wage of 15 shillings, was allowed rations by the government and he was also given a cottage at Parramatta. Governor King, writing to Banks in September 1800, expressed his intention to establish a botanical garden near the cottage. Caley was assisted by Daniel Moowattin an Aboriginal man of the Darug people. Daniel was Caley's interpreter, bush guide, gatherer of plant and animal specimens, bird-trapper, servant and companion on expeditions around Sydney. Caley sent many botanical and other specimens to Banks and his letters also kept Banks informed of the general conditions of the colony as well as scientific matters. Caley was the first to make a serious effort to study the Eucalyptus. In 1801 Caley went with Lieutenant James Grant to Western Port and in 1804 he gave King a long report on \\"A journey to ascertain the Limits or Boundaries of Vaccary Forest\\" (the Cowpastures). Caley was able to report on the wild cattle, which he found considerably increased in numbers. In November 1804 Caley, with three convict assistants, attempted to cross the Blue Mountains along the northern edge of the Grose Valley. He managed to reach and ascend a mountain he named Mount Banks. However, upon being struck by the awe-inspiring views of the sheer cliffs of the Grose Valley stretching away to the south, he decided to turn back, unaware he was only a day's walk away from the western escarpment and the open country lying beyond. In October 1805 he visited Norfolk Island and went to Hobart at the end of November that year. In August 1808 Banks wrote to Caley offering him an annuity of £50 a year and to release him from all services beyond what he voluntarily wished to perform and to remain in New South Wales if he desired. Caley was homesick for England, however, and decided to return to England. Later life Caley returned to England in 1810 and in 1816 was appointed curator of the botanic gardens in St Vincent, West Indies. He resigned from this position in December 1822 and was back in England in the following May. He died on 23 May 1829. He had married in 1816 but his wife predeceased him without children. Governor King found Caley 'eccentric and morose', both Banks and King found Caley difficult and at times tactless and unreasonable. He was, however, a good worker, a skilful and accurate botanist and he was thoroughly honest. He did not publish any works, but his collections did much to spread a knowledge of Australian plants in the early years of the nineteenth century. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Caley when citing a botanical name. He is recognised in several place names, including a Reserve name and bushland pavilion name at St. Ives, and in the orchid genus Caleana and the species Grevillea caleyi, Viola caleyana, Banksia caleyi, and Eucalyptus caleyi.Webb, J., (2002), ‘Caley, George’, in R.

He was burned to death inside his hall by the arson of two of his own sons in revenge for rejecting their mother and denying them their heritage. He was succeeded by his son Dómaldi.

He married the daughter of Aude the Rich, and gave her as her bride-gift three large farms, and a gold ornament. They had two sons, Gisle and Ond; but Visbur left her and took another wife, whereupon she went home to her father with her two sons. Visbur had a son who was called Domald, and his stepmother used witchcraft to give him ill-luck. Now, when Visbur's sons were the one twelve and the other thirteen years of age, they went to their father's place, and desired to have their mother's dower; but he would not deliver it to them. Then they said that the gold ornament should be the death of the best man in all his race, and they returned home. Then they began again with enchantments and witchcraft, to try if they could destroy their father. The sorceress Huld said that by witchcraft she could bring it about by this means, that a murderer of his own kin should never be wanting in the Yngling race; and they agreed to have it so. Thereafter they collected men, came unexpectedly in the night on Visbur, and burned him in his house.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr  } Snorri included a piece from Ynglingatal (9th century) in his account in the Heimskringla: {  :Ok Visburs :vilja byrgi :sævar niðr :svelga knátti, :þá er meinþjóf :markar öttu :setrs verjendr :á sinn föður; :ok allvald :í arinkjóli :glóða garmr :glymjandi beit.A second online presentation of Ynglingatal  :Have the fire-dogs' fierce tongues yelling :Lapt Visbur's blood on his own hearth? :Have the flames consumed the dwelling :Of the here's soul on earth? :Madly ye acted, who set free :The forest foe, red fire, night thief, :Fell brother of the raging sea, :Against your father and your chief.Laing's translation at Northvegr  } The Historia Norwegiæ presents a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, older than Snorri's quotation: {  Hic [Wanlanda] genuit Wisbur, quem filii sui cum omni curia sua, ut citius hærenditarentur, vivum incenderunt.

It is traditionally used for winter clothing such as the Selbu mitten (selbuvott) and sweaters (lusekofte, lopapeysa and mariusgenser). Of ancient origin, the pattern is associated with the town of Selbu in Norway, and has become an international symbol of Norway (or Scandinavia generally), Christmas and winter.  History  The design now known as the selburose has a long history. It appears in textiles across European history, and in knitting pattern books from Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany in the 16th to 18th century.Om selbumønsteret i Andemor Sundbøs Kvarsdagsstrikk fra 1994 (avfotografert bok fra Nasjonalbibliotekets arkiv) It appears to combine designs of Islamic and Christian tradition based on Coptic and Byzantine art, or even the Sumerian Star of Ishtar. In Norway, the pattern was already in use prior to 1857 on sweaters from Western Norway based on Danish designs. Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad (born 1841), a girl from Selbu, popularized the design in 1857 when she knitted three pairs of mittens with an eight-petalled rose design (åttebladrose) and brought them to church. She may have been inspired by stockings knitted by Marit Sessenggjerdet, a woman working for the same employer. The design became immediately popular in Selbu. The Norwegian Arts and Craft Club (Husflidslag) spread the selburose mitten fad across the country after 1910. By the 1930s, 100,000 pairs were made in Selbu every year, and by 1960, much of the town's economy depended on the trade. The popularity of the design in Norway may have been helped by the desire to establish a Norwegian national identity as the decades-long process of Norwegian independence from Sweden had thought leaders searching for the country's \\"true spirit\\". The bold, \\"uniquely Norsk\\" design of the selburose fit these aspirations. Norwegian girls were taught to knit the pattern, as a pair of selbuvotter became the traditional gift of a girl to her fiancé and his friends. The home industry of Selbu mitten knitting helped make Norwegian farming life economically feasible and gave women a measure of economic independence. Norwegian emigration and international trade spread the symbol across the world, where it is often interpreted as a snowflake or a star instead of a flower. This helped cement the association between the selburose and winter clothing and therefore winter itself. The same pattern is widely known and used among Finno-Ugric peoples. In Finnish it is called Kannuksenpyörä.

Founded in 1887 by Emile Rossel, it was intended as a politically-independent source of news. It is one of the most popular Francophone newspapers in Belgium, competing with La Libre Belgique, and since 2005 has appeared in Berliner format. It is owned by Rossel & Cie, which also owns several Belgian news outlets and the French paper La Voix du Nord. History and profile Le Soir was founded as a free advertising newspaper in 1887. Later it became a paying paper. When Belgium was occupied during the Second World War, Le Soir continued to be published under German censorship, unlike many Belgian newspapers which went underground. The paper, which became known as \\"Le Soir Volé\\" (or \\"Stolen Le Soir\\"), was parodied by the resistance group, the Front de l'Indépendance which in 1943 published a satirical pro-Allied edition of the paper, dubbed the \\"Faux Soir\\" (or \\"Fake Soir\\"), which was mixed with official copies of the paper and distributed to news kiosks in Brussels. The \\"Stolen Le Soir\\" was notable for including Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin cartoons in serialized form during the war. The renewed production of the \\"Free Le Soir\\", under Lucien Fuss, restarted on 6 September 1944, just days after the Allied Liberation of Brussels. The publisher of the paper is Rossel company. Circulation In the period of 1995–96 Le Soir had a circulation of 182,798 copies. Its 2002 circulation was 130,495 copies with a market share of 20.3%. The circulation of the paper was 104,000 copies in 2003 and 101,000 copies in 2004. Editorial stance Compared to its centre-right Catholic competitor, La Libre Belgique, Le Soir is seen as liberal and progressive with politically federalist leanings. Reaffirmed on the occasion of the release of the new format on 15 November 2005, Le Soir describes its editorial stance as \\"a progressive and independent daily newspaper.\\" It describes its aims to be a \\"counterweight\\" and \\"always alert, in line with society\\". It describes its role as: Google controversy The paper gained some notoriety on the internet after it successfully sued the search engine Google for copyright infringement. The case was built on the fact that Google made parts of the newspaper's website available through its search engine and its Google News service, even after the articles in question had been removed from the newspaper's website. A Belgian judge ruled that this did not conform to Belgian regulations and ordered Google to remove all \\"copyright violations\\" from its websites. Google responded as requested, by removing all links to the Belgian newspaper not only from its news service but also from its search index.Belgian newspaper: Google blocking us on searches, Associated Press via CBS News, 15 July 2011 Charlie Hebdo bomb threat In response to the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in which 12 people died on 7 January 2015, some international organizations such as Reporters Without Borders and the Index on Censorship called for controversial Charlie Hebdo cartoons to be re- published in solidarity with the French satirical magazine and in defense of free speech. The Hamburger Morgenpost included Charlie Hebdo cartoons on its front cover on 8 January and was subsequently firebombed. Le Soir faced bomb threats for republishing Charlie Hebdo cartoons, including many satirising religion.

He was a great warrior, and went far around in different lands. Once he took up his winter abode in Finland with Snae the Old, and got his daughter Driva in marriage; but in spring he set out leaving Driva behind, and although he had promised to return within three years he did not come back for ten. Then Driva sent a message to the witch Huld; and sent Visbur, her son by Vanlande, to Sweden. Driva bribed the witch- wife Huld, either that she should bewitch Vanlande to return to Finland, or kill him. When this witch-work was going on Vanlande was at Upsal, and a great desire came over him to go to Finland; but his friends and counsellors advised him against it, and said the witchcraft of the Finn people showed itself in this desire of his to go there. He then became very drowsy, and laid himself down to sleep; but when he had slept but a little while he cried out, saying that the Mara was treading upon him. His men hastened to him to help him; but when they took hold of his head she trod on his legs, and when they laid hold of his legs she pressed upon his head; and it was his death.

Thus the interval order matters — a perfect fifth, for instance (C,G), ordered , 2:3, gives an \\"effect of indicated continuation\\", while , 3:2, gives an \\"effect of finality\\". This is a measure of interval strength or stability and finality. Notice that it is similar to the more common measure of interval strength, which is determined by its approximation to a lower, stronger, or higher, weaker, position in the harmonic series. The reason for the effect of finality of such interval ratios may be seen as follows. If F = h_2/2^n is the interval ratio in consideration, where n is a positive integer and h_2 is the higher harmonic number of the ratio, then its interval can be determined by taking the base-2 logarithm I=12log_2(h_2/2^n)=12log_2(h_2) - 12n (3/2=7.02 and 4/3=4.98). The difference of these terms is the harmonic series representation of the interval in question (using harmonic numbers), whose bottom note 12n is a transposition of the tonic by n octaves. This suggests why descending interval ratios with denominator a power of two are final. A similar situation is seen if the term in the numerator is a power of two.Krumhansl, Carol L.

(Caricature by Albert Engström) Fjölnir is a legendary king in Norse mythology said to have been the son of Freyr (Frey) and his consort Gerðr (Gertha). The name appears in a variety of forms, including Fiolnir, Fjölner, Fjolner, and Fjolne. He was claimed as the progenitor of the Swedish Yngling dynasty, reigning from Gamla Uppsala. According to the Grottasöngr, Fjölnir lived from the 1st century BC to the early 1st century AD. Fjölnir was said to have drowned in a vat of mead while visiting Peace-Fróði, a similarly-legendary king of Zealand, the Danish island. Fjölnir was then succeeded by his son Sveigðir.  Name  The etymology of the Old Norse name Fjǫlnir is unclear. It could stem from the verb fela ('to hide'), with Fjǫlnir as 'the concealer [of the mead of poetry]', or it may have emerged as an abbreviation of fjǫlviðr ('the very wise'). A derivation from fjǫl ('crowd') has also been proposed, with Fjǫlnir as the 'manifold' or the 'multiplier', although such an adverbial formation has no attested parallel. According to Lindow, the second etymology may be more fitting for a name of Odin, but the meaning remains uncertain in any case. Fjölnir is indeed also frequently mentioned as a name of Odin. In Grímnismál ('The Lay of Grímnir'), Odin mentions it to Geirröðr as one of his many names that constitute the beginning of his epiphany. In Reginsmál ('The Lay of Reginn'), a man who is clearly Odin uses Fjölnir to refer to himself as he is standing on a mountain addressing Sigurd and Regin. In Gylfaginning ('The Beguiling of Gylfi'), Fjölnir appears among the 12 names given for Alfödr, another name of Odin. Attestations =Grottasöngr= Grottasöngr informs that Fjölnir was the contemporary of Caesar Augustus (63 BC – AD 14). He was a mighty king and the crops were bountiful and peace was maintained. At his time, King Fróði, the son of Friðleifr, ruled in Lejre in Zealand. Grottasöngr relates that when Fróði once visited Uppsala he brought two giantesses, Fenja and Menja: :Fróði konungr sótti heimboð í Svíþjóð til þess konungs, er Fjölnir er nefndr. Þá keypti hann ambáttir tvær, er hétu Fenja ok Menja. Þær váru miklar ok sterkar.Gróttasöngr at Norrøne Tekster og Kvad However, the two giantesses were to be his undoing (see Grottasöngr). =Ynglinga saga= The Ynglinga saga tells that Fjölnir was the son of Freyr himself and the giantess Gerd, but he was the first of his house who was not to be deified. {cellpadding=3  Freyr tók þá ríki eptir Njörð; var hann kallaðr dróttinn yfir Svíum ok tók skattgjafir af þeim; hann var vinsæll ok ársæll sem faðir hans.

He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Upsal, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods. Then began the Upsal domains, which have remained ever since. Then began in his days the Frode- peace; and then there were good seasons, in all the land, which the Swedes ascribed to Frey, so that he was more worshipped than the other gods, as the people became much richer in his days by reason of the peace and good seasons. His wife was called Gerd, daughter of Gymis, and their son was called Fjolne.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr  } Then Snorri tells that after Freyr's death, Fjölnir became the king of Sweden. However, he drowned in a vat of mead visiting Peace-Fróði (Friðfróði), the king of Zealand. {cellpadding=3  Fjölnir, son Yngvifreys, réð þá fyrir Svíum ok Uppsala auð; hann var ríkr ok ársæll ok friðsæll.

He was powerful, and lucky in seasons and in holding the peace. Fredfrode ruled then in Leidre, and between them there was great friendship and visiting. Once when Fjolne went to Frode in Sealand, a great feast was prepared for him, and invitations to it were sent all over the country. Frode had a large house, in which there was a great vessel many ells high, and put together of great pieces of timber; and this vessel stood in a lower room. Above it was a loft, in the floor of which was an opening through which liquor was poured into this vessel. The vessel was full of mead, which was excessively strong. In the evening Fjolne, with his attendants, was taken into the adjoining loft to sleep. In the night he went out to the gallery to seek a certain place, and he was very sleepy and exceedingly drunk. As he came back to his room he went along the gallery to the door of another left, went into it, and his foot slipping, he fell into the vessel of mead and was drowned.  } =Ynglingatal= Snorri also quoted some lines of Ynglingatal, composed in the 9th century: {  :Varð framgengt, :þars Fróði bjó, :feigðarorð, :es at Fjölni kom; :ok sikling :svigðis geira :vágr vindlauss :of viða skyldi.  :In Frode's hall the fearful word, :The death-foreboding sound was heard: :The cry of fey denouncing doom, :Was heard at night in Frode's home. :And when brave Frode came, he found :Swithiod's dark chief, Fjolne, drowned. :In Frode's mansion drowned was he, :Drowned in a waveless, windless sea.Laing's translation at Northvegr  } The Historia Norwegiæ provides a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, which precedes Snorri's quotation. It also informs that Fjölnir was the son of Freyr, the father of Svegder and that he drowned in a vat of mead: {  Froyr vero genuit Fiolni, qui in dolio medonis dimersus est, cujus filius Swegthir [...]Storm, Gustav (editor) (1880).

ISBN 8772898135, p. 75.  } The even earlier source Íslendingabók cites the line of descent in Ynglingatal and also gives Fjölnir as the successor of Freyr and the predecessor of Svegðir. In addition to this it summarizes that Fjölnir died at Friðfróði's (i.e. Peace-Fróði): iii Freyr. iiii Fjölnir. sá er dó at Friðfróða. v Svegðir:.Guðni Jónsson's edition of Íslendingabók =Gesta Danorum= In Gesta Danorum, Book 1, Frodi corresponds to Hadingus and Fjölnir to Hundingus, but the story is a little different. It relates how King Hundingus of Sweden believed a rumor that King Hadingus of Denmark had died and held his obsequies with ceremony, including an enormous vat of ale. Hundingus himself served the ale, but accidentally stumbled and fell into the vat, choked, and drowned. When word came to King Hadingus of this unfortunate death, King Hadingus publicly hanged himself (see Freyr). =Ballad of Veraldur= Dumézil (1973, Appendix I) cites a Faroese ballad recorded in 1840 about Odin and his son Veraldur. It is believed that this Veraldur is related to Fjölnir and Freyr, as per Snorri's statement that Freyr was veraldar goð (\\"god of the world\\"). In this ballad Veraldur sets off to Zealand to seek the king's daughter in marriage despite Odin's warnings. The king of Zealand dislikes Veraldur and tricks him into falling into a brewing vat in a \\"hall of stone\\" where Veraldur drowns. When Odin hears the news, he decides to die and go to Asgard where his followers will also be welcomed after death. The tale is similar to that of the death of Fjölnir, son of Freyr, who accidentally fell into a vat of mead and drowned while paying a friendly visit to Fridfródi the ruler of Zealand.

It is the second film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his dog Gromit, following A Grand Day Out (1989). In the film, a sinister penguin named Feathers McGraw uses Wallace and Gromit's robotic \\"Techno Trousers\\" to steal a diamond. The Wrong Trousers premiered in the United States of America on 17 December 1993, and the United Kingdom on 26 December 1993 on BBC Two. It was commercially successful, and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1994. It also inspired a charity fundraising day, known as \\"Wrong Trousers Day\\", one of several events. The short was followed by two sequels, A Close Shave, released in December 1995, and A Matter of Loaf and Death released in December 2008. Feathers McGraw would reappear in the 2003 video game Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo. Plot To pay off debts, Wallace lets the spare bedroom to a penguin, who befriends Wallace and drives Gromit from the house. The penguin takes an interest in Wallace's new \\"techno trousers\\", which can walk on walls and ceilings, and secretly rewires them for radio control. Gromit realises that the penguin is a wanted criminal, who disguises himself as a chicken, Feathers McGraw. Feathers forces Wallace into the techno trousers and sends him on a test run through town. Later, Gromit spies on Feathers as he takes measurements of the city museum, and discovers Feathers' plans to steal a diamond from the museum. While Wallace sleeps, Feathers marches him to the museum and uses the trousers to infiltrate the building. He uses a remotely operated crane claw, contained in a helmet he has made Wallace wear, to capture the diamond, but accidentally trips the alarm. As Wallace wakes up, Feathers marches him back to the house and traps him and Gromit in a wardrobe at gunpoint. Gromit rewires the trousers to break open the wardrobe. He and Wallace chase Feathers aboard their model train set. Wallace disarms Feathers and frees himself from the trousers. After Feathers' train collides with the trousers, Gromit captures him in a milk bottle. The police imprison Feathers in the city zoo. Wallace and Gromit pay their debts with the reward money, while the techno trousers walk off into the sunset. Cast *Peter Sallis as Wallace Soundtrack alterations In the original airing and first VHS release of the film, Gromit's birthday card plays \\"Happy Birthday to You\\". In subsequent home video releases and airings, this was replaced with \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\" to avoid copyright infringements. Also altered (again for reasons of copyright) are two specific songs from the penguin's radio which were replaced with extracts from Hammond organ versions of \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\". The pieces that were removed are \\"Happy Talk\\" from the musical South Pacific and \\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\", along with Wallace's singing of the latter during the subsequent morning. In addition, Gromit's television during breakfast no longer plays the Open University theme, although an announcer can still be heard saying, \\"Welcome to Open University\\". However, the original soundtrack can still be heard in the background of the commentary track of the DVD release, although the Blu-ray release features the commentary track with the altered soundtrack. The original soundtrack can also be heard in non English versions of the film. Reception The Wrong Trousers was voted as the eighteenth best British television show by the British Film Institute. It has a unanimously positive score on Rotten Tomatoes, with 24 reviews, 100% positive and an average score of 9.1/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"An endearing and meticulous showcase of stop motion animation, The Wrong Trousers also happens to be laugh out loud funny.\\" The film was awarded the Grand Prix at the Tampere Film Festival, and the Grand Prix at the World Festival of Animated film – Animafest Zagreb in 1994. The Wrong Trousers won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1994.

The blends, flavorings, color scheme, and overall marketing concepts closely followed the Benson and Hedges model. Early packs (1968-1978) read \\"Benson and Hedges Park Avenue New York\\", near the bottom. Virginia Slims are narrower ( circumference) than standard cigarettes (hence, \\"Slims\\"), and are also longer than normal \\"king-sized\\" cigarettes (which are ), sold only in longer lengths, to give the cigarettes a more \\"elegant\\" appearance and ostensibly to reduce the amount of smoke they produce. They are also sold in \\"Superslims\\", \\"Lights,\\" (now called Gold), and \\"Ultra Lights,\\" (now called Silver) varieties. All packings are available in menthol and non- menthol. The original packaging was designed by Walter Landor, and was white with colored stripes running lengthwise along the left side. In 2016, the package design was updated to replace the stripes with a more floral, mottled appearance. The first test market was San Francisco, California. Originally scheduled for six months, it was cut short after seven weeks due to the success of the introduction - a nearly 3% market penetration. Distribution and marketing was implemented nationwide, and by September 30, 1968, the entire U.S. was covered.* How an agency builds a brand -- the Virginia Slims story In 1976, a full-flavor packing was test-marketed in Fresno, California. Designed to compete with RJ Reynolds More brand, the test ultimately failed and this entry was withdrawn. In 1978, Virginia Slims Lights were introduced, with good success. Although early marketing concepts included soft pack, Philip Morris decided to use a box-pack design only. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, growth and market penetration was significant, drawing the attention of competitors who introduced their own slim, female-oriented brands (such as American Tobacco Company's Misty, Brown and Williamson's Capri, Liggett's Eve, and R.J Reynolds' Dawn). In 1984, Virginia Slims Ovals were test marketed in Rochester, NY, Birmingham, AL, and Las Vegas, NV, but were unsuccessful and withdrawn. Ovals were light, and had an oval-shaped cross section. In 1985, Virginia Slims Luxury Lights 120's were introduced - a length packing again intended to better compete with RJ Reynolds More brand, as well as other 120's on the market.Why They Stretched the Slims, New York Times, Author Cathryn Jakobson, June 8, 1986 After test marketing in Portland, OR and Nashville, TN was successful, the new style was rolled out nationally. While initially concerned that 120's might 'cannibalize' customers from other packings (especially Lights), this proved to be unfounded, as the 120's appeared to attract a slightly older demographic. The packing has since become a mainstay of the smoking glamour community. It is arguable as to whether VS120's are truly 'light', since their rating numbers compare more closely to full-flavor. Pack of Virginia Slims cigarettes In 1987, Ultra Lights 100's were introduced, in keeping with changing consumer tastes, other competitive entries, and the Benson and Hedges model. Marginally successful, this packing remains on the market today. In 1989, Superslims Lights 100's were introduced, in response to ultra-thin ( circumference) competition and consumer demand for a 'low-smoke' product entry. These were also marginally successful, and remain on the market. In 1993, a 10-Pack version of Lights 100's were introduced, with 10 cigarettes per pack, costing approximately half the price of a 20-pack. This entry had limited success and came under attack from critics. It was ultimately withdrawn. In 1994, Virginia Slims Kings ( length) were designed as a discount entry and possibly to compete with other king-size entries such as RJ Reynolds' Camel brand. It is not clear whether Kings were ever test marketed, but they were never introduced on a nationwide basis. In 2003, a box-pack was introduced for full flavor 100's, in response to consumer demand. This packing is steadily displacing the classic soft-pack. Also in 2003, the package graphics were slightly altered, changing the colors and striping along the edge. In 2004, Luxury Ultra Lights 120's (both menthol and non menthol) were introduced with marginal success. It is likely that this packing will continue to be supported. In 2008, Virginia Slims Superslims were introduced in a smaller-sized \\"Purse Pack\\". In 2016, the package graphics for all styles were slightly altered, changing the stripes along the edge to a more mottled and floral-like appearance. All packings were simultaneously introduced in both Menthol and non-menthol (e.g., Regular or Filter) varieties. Unlike most other brands, Menthol represents 40–55% of the total sales of a particular packing (vs. 25–35%). In all, there have been 11 packings introduced or test marketed in the US, of which 7 are still on the market. There are other varieties marketed in the Asian-Pacific region (including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam), Russia, and South Africa. Virginia Slims has never had a significant European or South American presence. Marketing From inception, Virginia Slims have been designed and marketed as a female-oriented fashion brand, generally targeted towards a younger demographic (18- to 35-year-olds). While various themes emerged in the marketing campaigns over the years, the basic threads have been independence, liberation, slimness, attractiveness, glamour, style, taste, and a contrast to men's cigarettes. Thus, Virginia Slims functioned as a pioneer brand, which successfully implemented an empowering female-centered marketing strategy, also known as femvertising. A report by the Surgeon General of the United States has interpreted these marketing strategies as attempting to link smoking \\"to women's freedom, emancipation, and empowerment\\". This report also tied the increase of smoking among teenage girls to rises in sales of Virginia Slims and other \\"niche\\" brands marketed directly to women. 1970 Virginia Slims ad published on a magazine. The legend says \\"You've come a long way, baby\\" In the 1960s and 1970s, the themes of feminism and women's liberation, with the slogan \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\\" were often used in the ads, and often featured anecdotes about women in the early 20th century who were punished for being caught smoking, usually by their husbands or other men, as compared to the time of the ads when more women had equal rights, usually comparing smoking to things like the right to vote. Later campaigns have used the slogans, \\"It's a woman thing.\\" in the 1990s, and \\"Find your voice.\\" in the 2000s. Television and print ads often featured well-known models and designer fashions. Print ads were generally placed in women's magazines, and formed the mainstay of the marketing campaign, supplemented with billboards and point-of- purchase displays. From 1969 until 1971 (when cigarette advertising on television became prohibited), television advertising was an important component; the commercials would begin with actors dressed in period costumes re-enacting the early 20th century anecdotes in comedic fashion, followed by a glamorous modern-day model, smoking the product while proudly dressed in the latest fashions, accompanied by \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\\", which in the commercials was an up-tempo, catchy pop-rock jingle: You've come a long way, baby To get where you've got to today You've got your own cigarette now, baby You've come a long, long way On January 1, 1971, at 11:59 p.m, an ad for Virginia Slims was aired during The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson which became notable as the final cigarette advertisement to air on television before the implementation of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which prohibited the radio and television advertising of all cigarettes in the United States, regardless of the demographics at which they were aimed. Several other, less important, marketing vehicles were employed, such as the Virginia Slims Book of Days (a day timer/calendar book), fashion shows, and an extensive line of products, apparel, and accessories. The \\"Find your voice\\" ad campaign was criticized for being offensive to those who have lost their voices to throat cancer as a result of smoking, especially in light of the well-publicized laryngectomy of Janet Sackman, a former model for another cigarette brand, who developed throat and lung cancer. The campaign was also criticised for targeting minority women; the campaign and the brand sought to associate themselves with empowerment, independence, women's rights, and sexual allure. The campaign was also criticized for the slogan \\"NEVER let the goody two shoes get you down\\", which uses reactance to promote product use. It has also been suggested that it urges smokers to disregard health warnings.1999 advertisement described in previous source, in the collection of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising The campaign also featured a model using a throat-touching gesture, which echoes earlier ads which made more explicit claims of voice box benefits.Classic vs. modern ad comparison, Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising ad database. The Leo Burnett advertising agency handled the Virginia Slims account throughout most of the product lifetime. Market share From its inception until 1978, Virginia Slims saw a steady increase in market share to 1.75% (3.9% of all female smokers). With the introduction of Lights in 1978, the market share increased to 2.5%. Other packings, including 120's, Ultra Lights, and Superslims helped push the market share to a peak of 3.1% (nearly 7% of female smokers) in 1989. With increased competition from other brands, notably Capri and Misty, the brand lost ground but stabilized at around 2.4% though 2003. Since then, it has lost about 0.1% per year, and was 2.0% in 2007 and 1.8% in 2009. This slow but steady decline is expected to continue, since the brand is no longer heavily promoted. Despite this, brand loyalty is well above average, and is still one of the highest in the industry. Markets Virginia Slims are mainly sold in the United States, but also was or still is sold in the British Virgin Islands, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Cyprus, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Australia. Sponsorship =Women's tennis= Virginia Slims sponsored the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour from 1971 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1994. This sponsorship is sometimes credited for the growth and success of women's tennis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Virginia Slims also sponsored the Virginia Slims Circuit, a tennis tour consisting of a group of originally nine female professional players. Formed in 1970, the Virginia Slims Circuit eventually became the basis for the later WTA Tour. The players, dubbed the Original 9, rebelled against the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) due to the wide inequality between the amount of prize money paid to male tennis players and to female tennis players. Heldman, with the assistance of Joe Cullman of Philip Morris, then offered US$5,000 out of her own pocket to allow the \\"Original 9\\" to sign token $1 contracts and set up their own tour of eight professional tournaments in 1970. The tour was sponsored by Virginia Slims. This independent women's professional tennis circuit provided more prize money than had been provided previously by the USLTA and other organizations. Despite the USLTA's suspension of the \\"Original 9\\" from its tournaments, by the end of the year the Virginia Slims Circuit was able to boost its numbers from nine to forty members, which helped pave the way for the first full year season of the Circuit in 1971. Subsequently, in the aftermath of the creation of the WTA in 1973, the Virginia Slims Circuit would eventually absorb the ILTF's Women's Grand Prix circuit and become the WTA Tour. In popular culture =Music= You've Come a Long Way, Baby is the name of the second album of the electronic musician Fatboy Slim, released in 1998. The Black Lips' song \\"Dog Years\\" references Virginia Slims Ultra Lights. Greyson Chance references Virginia Slims as his mother's favorite brand and brings its up multiple times on his 'Portraits' album. =Television= Episode number 66 of the animated television show Duckman is titled \\"You've Come a Wrong Way, Baby\\". The episode is as follows: After catching Mambo with a cigarette in his mouth, Bernice challenges the tobacco industry on the floor of Congress. During testimony she is invited to a tobacco plantation by Walt Evergreen (voiced by Jim Varney)—president of an unnamed tobacco company—which does not go well for the family.

His education in art helped to spur the development of a set of inkblots that were used experimentally to measure various unconscious parts of the subject's personality. His method has come to be referred to as the Rorschach test, iterations of which have continued to be used over the years to help identify personality, psychotic, and neurological disorders. Rorschach continued to refine the test until his premature death at age 37.Huffman, K. (2008), Psychology in Action, John Wiley & Sons, 9th Edition, Early life Rorschach was born in Zürich, Switzerland, the eldest of three children born to Ulrich and Philippine Rorschach. He had one sister, Anna, and one brother, Paul. He spent his childhood and youth in Schaffhausen, in northern Switzerland. He was known to his school friends as Klex, or \\"inkblot\\" since he enjoyed klecksography making fanciful inkblot \\"pictures\\". By the time of Rorschach's youth, consideration of the projective significance of inkblots already had some historical context. For example, in 1857, German doctor Justinus Kerner had published a popular book of poems, each of which was inspired by an accidental inkblot. It has been speculated that the book was known to Rorschach. French psychologist Alfred Binet had also experimented with inkblots as a creativity test. Rorschach's father, an art teacher, encouraged him to express himself creatively through painting and drawing conventional pictures. As the time of his high school graduation approached, he could not decide between a career in art and one in science. He wrote a letter to the German biologist Ernst Haeckel asking his advice. A major factor that led Rorschach to differ from his father and not pursue art was that his father died while he was still trying to decide what to study. Education and career Rorschach, in his early years, attended Schaffhausen Kantonaleschule in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Rorschach was a bright student from the beginning, and he often tutored other students at his school. After Ernst Haeckel suggested a career in science, Rorschach enrolled in medical school at the University of Zurich. While studying, Rorschach began learning Russian, and in 1906, while studying in Berlin, he traveled to Russia for a holiday. Travel was a large part of his life after medical school. On a trip to Dijon, in France, he met a man who taught him about Russian culture. Torn by the decision whether to stay in Switzerland or move to Russia, he eventually took a job as first assistant at a Cantonal Mental Hospital. While working at the hospital, Rorschach finished his doctoral dissertation in 1912 under the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had taught Carl Jung. The excitement in intellectual circles over psychoanalysis constantly reminded Rorschach of his childhood inkblots. Wondering why different people often saw entirely different things in the same inkblots, he began, while still a medical student, showing inkblots to schoolchildren and analyzing their responses. This dissertation contained the origins for his ink blot experiment. All the while, Rorschach remained fascinated by Russian culture. In 1913, he obtained a fellowship opportunity in Russia, where he continued to study contemporary psychiatric methods. Rorschach spent some time in the city of Kryukovo outside of Moscow, and in 1914 he returned to Switzerland to work at the Waldau University Hospital in Bern. In 1915, Rorschach took the position of assistant director at the regional psychiatric hospital at Herisau, and in 1921 he wrote his book Psychodiagnostik, which was to form the basis of the inkblot test. Personal life Rorschach graduated in medicine at Zurich in 1909 and at the same time became engaged to Olga Stempelin, a girl from Kazan (in the present- day Republic of Tatarstan, Russia). The couple were married in 1913 and lived in Russia until their relocation back to Switzerland, for Rorschach's work, in 1915.Herman Rorschach, M.D at mhhe.com They had two children, a daughter Elizabeth (called \\"Lisa\\", 1917–2006) and a son, Ulrich Wadin (called \\"Wadim\\", 1919–2010). Neither Lisa nor Wadim had children. One year after writing Psychodiagnostik, Rorschach died of peritonitis, probably resulting from a ruptured appendix. He was still associate director of the Herisau Hospital when he died, aged 37, on 1 April 1922. Legacy In 2001 the inkblot test was criticised as pseudoscience and its use was declared controversial by Scientific American, as different psychologists drew different findings from the same data, suggesting their results were subjective rather than objective.Scott O. Lilienfeld, James M. Wood and Howard N. Garb: What's wrong with this picture? Scientific American, May 2001 In 2013 and 2015 two systemic reviews and meta-analyses were published that resulted in the criticism as pseudoscience being lifted. In November 2013, Google celebrated the 129th anniversary of Rorschach's birth with a Google Doodle showing an interpretation of his inkblot test. Aside from the MMPI, the Rorschach Inkblot Method has generated more published research than any other psychological personality measure. The cover of The Essentials of Psycho-analysis by Sigmund Freud, published in the \\"Vintage Freud\\" series by Vintage Books in 2005, features artwork by Michael Salu based on a Rorschach Inkblot. Hermann Rorschach's legacy for personality assessment is undeniable. The inkblots test, created almost a century ago, consists of an important professional tool to identify personality traits. Since its development, the instrument has been used by countless people around the world, with different theoretical and professional approaches.Amraro, T. A. C. & Hisatugo, C. L. C. (2019).

His writing honors include a 2012 Deems Taylor Award for internet writing and a Mellon Fellowship at Harvard. His Brahms and Ives biographies were end-of-year Critics' Choices in The New York Times. The Ives biography was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award in biography and won the Pen-Winship prize for a book on a New England subject. His biography Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph in its first week appeared on the New York Times bestseller list. He has taught at schools including Boston University, Amherst College, Tufts, and Boston Conservatory. Swafford's music, which is highly lyrical and moves freely between tonality and atonality, has been called New Romantic in style. There are equal if less overt contributions from world music, especially Indian and Balinese, and from jazz and blues. The titles of his works reveal a steady inspiration from nature and landscape. The composer views his own work as a kind of classicism: a concern with clarity, directness, and expression, or as he puts it, \\"music that sounds familiar though it is new, works that sound like they wrote themselves.\\" Notable are his orchestral works Landscape with Traveler (1979–80), After Spring Rain (1981–82) and From the Shadow of the Mountain (2001), the piano quintet Midsummer Variations (1985), the piano quartet They Who Hunger (1989), and the piano trio They That Mourn (2002), the last in memoriam 9/11. In 2012 cellist Rhonda Rider premiered his solo cello work The Silence at Yuma Point, part of a commissioning project of pieces inspired by the Grand Canyon (where Swafford has been a frequent hiker). His compositional awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Composer Grant, two Massachusetts Artists Foundation Fellowships, and a Tanglewood Fellowship.

He is best known as a translator of Greek patristic material, especially the work of Origen, into Latin. Life Rufinus was born in 344 or 345 in the Roman city of Julia Concordia (now Concordia Sagittaria), near Aquileia (in modern-day Italy) at the head of the Adriatic Sea. It appears that both of his parents were Christians. Around 370, he was living in a monastic community in Aquileia when he met Jerome. In about 372, Rufinus travelled to the eastern Mediterranean, where he studied in Alexandria under Didymus the Blind for some time, and became friends with Macarius the elder and other ascetics in the desert. In Egypt, if not even before leaving Italy, he had become intimately acquainted with Melania the Elder, a wealthy and devout Roman widow. When she moved to Palestine, taking with her a number of clergy and monks on whom the persecutions of the Arian Valens had borne heavily, Rufinus followed her, moving to Jerusalem in 380. There, while his patroness lived in a convent of her own in Jerusalem, Rufinus, at her expense, gathered together a number of monks to form a new monastery on the Mount of Olives, devoting himself to the study of Greek theology. This combination of the contemplative life and the life of learning had already developed in the Egyptian monasteries. When Jerome came to Bethlehem in 386, the friendship formed at Aquileia was renewed. Jerome, along with his patroness Paula, set up a similar community in Bethlehem a few years later. Another of the intimates of Rufinus was John II, Bishop of Jerusalem, and formerly a monk of the Natrun desert, by whom he was ordained to the priesthood in 390.The Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature. (James Strong and John McClintock, eds.); Harper and Brothers; NY; 1880 In 394, as a result of the attacks by Epiphanius of Salamis upon the doctrines of Origen made during a visit to Jerusalem, a fierce quarrel broke out, which found Rufinus and Jerome on different sides. Although both Jerome and Rufinus had previously been great admirers of Origen's work, in the light of Epiphanius' criticism of Origen, Jerome felt that Rufinus was not fierce enough in attacking the works of Origen. Three years afterwards a formal reconciliation was brought about between Jerome and Bishop John, with whom Rufinus sided,(Jerome) John N. Hritzu, tr., ed., Dogmatic and Polemical Works (The Fathers of the Church, Volume 53), \\"General Introduction\\" pp xii ff. but this was to prove only temporary. In the autumn of 397 Rufinus embarked for Rome, where, finding that the theological controversies of the East were exciting much interest and curiosity, he published a Latin translation of the Apology of Pamphilus for Origen, and also (398-99) a somewhat free rendering of the Περὶ Αρχῶν (or De Principiis) of that author himself. In the preface to the latter work he referred to Jerome as an admirer of Origen, and as having already translated some of his works with modifications of ambiguous doctrinal expressions. This allusion annoyed Jerome, who was exceedingly sensitive as to his reputation for orthodoxy, and the consequence was a bitter pamphlet war, with Rufinus' Against Jerome and Jerome's Against Rufinus. At the instigation of Theophilus of Alexandria, Pope Anastasius I (399-401) summoned Rufinus from Aquileia to Rome to vindicate his orthodoxy, but he excused himself from a personal attendance in a written Apologia pro fide sua. The pope in his reply expressly condemned Origen, but left the question of Rufinus' orthodoxy to his own conscience. He was, however, regarded with suspicion in orthodox circles (cf. the Decretum Gelasii, 20). Rufinus spent most of the first decade of the fifth century translating Origen. He translated Origen's homilies for the whole Heptateuch except Deuteronomy, and others on selected Psalms, the Song of Songs, and 1 Samuel. Rufinus' translation of Origen's Commentary on Romans (c405-6) gave fresh stimulus to discussions of destiny and free will that had been going on in Roman circles since the mid-390s and would shortly become an issue in Augustine's clash with Pelagius.Mark Vessey, 'Jerome and Rufinus', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), p324 Rufinus also translated other works. These include Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, translated in 401 at the request of Bishop Chromatius of Aquileia as an antidote to the terror caused by the Gothic incursions into Italy.Mark Vessey, 'Jerome and Rufinus', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), p325 Rufinus omits much of Eusebius' tenth book, and compresses what remains of it into book 9; he also retouches the narrative in several places and adds two books of his own to bring the account down to the death of Theodosius the Great (395). Such translations often appear to have been done as a result of a commission, or with a local readership in mind, and so it seems likely that Rufinus worked with the support of friends and patrons. Between 397 and 408 he lived in Italy, probably mainly in Rome and Aquileia; in 408 Rufinus was at the monastery of Pinetum (in the Campagna?), having been driven there by the arrival of Alaric in northern Italy. He fled to Sicily when Alaric moved south and pillaged Rome in 410. He was in the company of Melania the Younger in his flight. He died in Sicily in 411.Mark Vessey, 'Jerome and Rufinus', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), p327 Works =Original works= * Commentarius in symbolum apostolorum: a commentary on the Apostles' Creed which gives evidence of its use and interpretation in 4th-century Italy.

L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone, eds., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3 rev. ed. (Oxford University Press, 2005 [online 2009]). =Translations from Greek to Latin= Rufinus translated the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius of Caesarea and continued the work from the reign of Constantine I to the death of Theodosius I (395). It was published in 402 or 403. Origen's commentary on the New Testament Epistle to the Romans, along with many of his sermons on the Old Testament, survive only in versions by Rufinus. The full text of Origen's De principiis (On first principals) also survives only in Rufinus' translation. Jerome, earlier a friend of Rufinus, fell out with him and wrote at least three works opposing his opinions and condemning his translations as flawed. For instance, Jerome prepared a (now lost) translation of Origen's De principiis to replace Rufinus' translation, which Jerome said was too free. The other translations of Rufinus are # the Instituta Monachorum and some of the Homilies of Basil of Caesarea # the Apology of Pamphilus, referred to above # Origen's Principia # Origen's Homilies (Gen. Lev. Num. Josh. Kings, also Cant, and Rom.) # Opuscula of Gregory of Nazianzus # the Sententiae of Sixtus, an unknown Greek philosopher # the Sententiae of Evagrius # the Clementine Recognitions (the only form in which that work is now extant) # the Canon Paschalis of Anatolius Alexandrinus. =Quotes from Tyrannius Rufinus= He said; \\"[The Incarnation] was that the divine nature of the Son of God might be like a kind of hook hidden beneath the form of human flesh… to lure on the prince of this world to a contest; that the Son might offer him his human flesh as a bait and that the divinity which lay underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its hook… then, just as a fish when it seizes a baited hook not only fails to drag off the bait but is itself dragged out of the water to serve as food for others; so he that had the power of death sees the body of Jesus in death, unaware of the hook of divinity which lay hidden inside. Having swallowed it, he was immediately caught. The gates of hell were broken, and he was, as it were, drawn up from the pit, to become food for others.\\" — Christian Theology, an Introduction, Chapter 13, The Doctrine of Salvation in Christ. Influence We can hardly overestimate the influence which Rufinus exerted on Western theologians by thus putting the great Greek fathers into the Latin tongue. Dominic Vallarsi's uncompleted edition of Rufinus (vol. i. folio. Verona, 1745) contains the De Benedictionibus, the Apologies, the Expositio Symboli, the Historia Eremitica and the two original books of the Historia Ecclesiastica.

Bathymetric map of Laysan Monk seal on the beach at Laysan Island. Note ripple pattern in coral sand (June 1969). Laysan from the north The interior of Laysan, showing its lake and the birds that nest there. The shore of Lake Laysan. Laysan (; ), located northwest of Honolulu at N25° 42' 14\\" W171° 44' 04\\", is one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It comprises one land mass of , about in size. It is an atoll of sorts, although the land completely surrounds a shallow central lake some above sea level that has a salinity approximately three times greater than the ocean. Laysan's Hawaiian name of Kauō means egg. Geology Laysan is the second largest single landmass in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, after Sand Island at Midway Atoll. Laysan was created by coral growth and geologic upshift.Rauzon 2001, p.100. The fringing reefs surrounding the island cover about . Lake Laysan, the , brown, hypersaline lake in the island's interior, has varied in depth over the decades. In the 1860s, the lake was at most deep, but by the 1920s it averaged deep, because of the buildup of sand that had been blown away in sandstorms. The best way to find fresh water on Laysan is to observe where the finches are drinking; the fresh water floats on the saltier water and accumulates around the shore. The tallest point on the island is at above sea level, on a large dune that covers much of the northern portion of the island. A U.S. Geological Survey study found that Laysan, Midway Atoll, and Pacific islands like them could become inundated and unfit to live on during this century.\\"Storm Surges, Rising Seas Could Doom Pacific Islands This Century: Atolls and other low-lying islands in the Pacific Ocean may not slip under the waves but they will likely become uninhabitable due to overwashing waves\\" ClimateWire and Scientific American April 12, 2013 History =Discovery and early expeditions= Native Hawaiians may have known about Kauō before Americans and Europeans sailed their ships into the region in the early 19th century (see below). The first reported sightings of the island were by Massachusetts whalers in the 1820s. The Nantucket Enquirer reported a sighting in 1825.The Daily National Journal (citing an article in The Nantucket Enquirer), issue of 7 March 1825. Here we probably find the first reference to the name Laysan in print. They were among many who took advantage of the newly discovered whaling grounds off the coast of Japan, making the waters around the Northwest Hawaiian archipelago an increasingly popular commercial route. A United States government survey of Pacific Ocean geography in 1828 included the earlier whalers' reports and an additional sighting of an island fitting Laysan's description by Capt. \\"Brigs.\\"Jeremiah N. Reynolds, Address on the subject of a surveying and exploring expedition to the Pacific Ocean and South Seas: Delivered in the Hall of Representatives on the evening of April 3, 1836 (New York:1836), pp. 201 & 223. This may refer to Capt. John Briggs of New Bedford, who may have come across the island as early as 1822.In The New Bedford Mercury, 21 Feb 1823, p. 3, the ship Persia reports sighting Briggs' ship Wilmington & Liverpool Packet northwest of Midway Island. Various publications name Capt. Stanyukovich of the Russian ship Moller as the discoverer of Laysan. Although he mapped the island in 1828 and attempted to name it for his ship, he clearly was there after the New Englanders, at least. In 1857, Capt. John Paty of the Manuokawai annexed Laysan to the Kingdom of Hawaii. The island held an economic value in guano. In 1859, Capt. Brooks of the ship Gambia traveled to the island, and in his ship log wrote that there was guano there, but \\"not of sufficient quantity to warrant any attempts to get it.\\"Rauzon 2001, pg.101. Despite this estimate, in 1890 George D. Freeth and Charles N. Spencer successfully petitioned the Kingdom of Hawaii for permission to mine guano on Laysan and agreed to make royalty payments to the Kingdom. Around were extracted per day. Given that iron-hulled sailing ships towards the end of the guano mining era had a capacity of 5,000 tons, Layson produced a shipload every two months. The working condition at the guano mine was grueling. In August 1900, Japanese workers mutinied against American management. At first the workers refused to work. That Strike action turned to violence because of a language barrier. As a result, there were two deaths and two injuries. This newfound attention to Laysan attracted scientists, and in the next decade, many of Laysan's unique species were scientifically examined for the first time.Rauzon 2001, p.104. However, guano digging affected the island's ecosystem dramatically. Professor William Alanson Bryan of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum estimated that there were 10 million seabirds on Laysan in 1903, but eight years later the estimation was at little more than a million. In those eight years, the Pritchardia palms that were unique to Laysan, and the island's sandalwood trees (Santalum ellipticum) both became extinct. 1894 marked the arrival of Laysan's most notorious inhabitant, German immigrant Max Schlemmer. Schlemmer released domestic rabbits, Belgian hares, English hares and guinea pigs on the island, expecting them to multiply, and provide supplies for a future meat-canning business. This proved to be crucial in the decline of Laysan. =Period of extinction= The rabbits did multiply rapidly. Soon, the appetite of the rabbits far exceeded the available vegetation. Complaints about this and about Japanese poachers of the bird population led President Theodore Roosevelt to declare the Northwestern Hawaiian chain a bird sanctuary in 1909. Schlemmer continued to allow the Japanese to export bird wings illegally and so was removed from the island. But without plant cover, much of the soil and sand became loose and blew about in horrific dust storms. By 1918, the rabbits had eaten so much that the remaining vegetation was only enough to sustain 100 rabbits. Twenty-six plant species had been eradicated, and the Laysan millerbird had gone extinct.Rauzon 2001, p.110 In 1923, the Tanager Expedition arrived, and the rabbits were exterminated at long last. The bird population had been reduced to about a tenth of its former size. Three endemic taxa had become extinct, as had numerous other plant species. Two other endemic species, the Laysan duck and the Laysan finch, survive to this day, but are endangered. =Recent history= Like most of the Northwestern Hawaiian islands, Laysan is currently uninhabited. It is protected by the Hawaiian Natural Life Act of 1961 and cared for by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who have had success in eliminating pests, restoring the island to almost pre-desert state, and restoring the numbers of imperiled species. All sorts of garbage that is thrown from ships ends up floating to shore on Laysan. This poses a great danger to the birds because they swallow the plastic, which remains undigested and crowds the stomach, leaving no room for actual food. Curiously, most of the plastic found is Japanese in origin.Greene 2006. Additionally, in the 1990s, biologists found that a container of poisonous carbofuran had floated to shore and burst open above the high tide line, creating a \\"dead zone\\" which killed anything alive that went near it.Rauzon 2001, p.126-127. Sandbur eradication In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service started an effort to eradicate alien sandbur, a grass that crowds out the native bunchgrass, which is habitat for the birds. Sandbur was first introduced in the 1960s by US Armed Forces personnel.Rauzon 2001, p.120. Costing almost one million dollars, the project ended in 2000 when the sandbur was completely removed. With this threat gone, the USFWS hopes to restore Laysan to how it was before it was discovered. To replace the native Pritchardia palms that became extinct, the FWS wants to bring in Pritchardia remota from Nihoa, a similar species to Laysan's lost fan palm. Next may be Nihoa millerbirds, to replace the extinct Laysan millerbirds that were closely related. These transfers would accomplish a two-fold goal: to restore Laysan to an ecology similar to its pre-industrial one, and to protect those two species from extinction by maintaining a second population on Laysan. That way, if diseases, fires, or hurricanes obliterate the Nihoa population, the population can be revived by transplanting some from Laysan.Rauzon 2001, p.122. \\"Laysan fever\\" In 1991, several workers on Laysan contracted a feverish illness previously unknown there or anywhere else. It affected workers on Laysan in varying levels of severity: one woman was evacuated for persistent fever, but others exhibited very mild symptoms. Cedric Yoshimoto, of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa School of Public Health, wrote that \\"surveillance has identified a newly-described illness of humans termed 'Laysan fever (LF)' It is associated with bites of the seabird tick Ornithodoros capensis... [and] joins a short list of human illnesses associated with seabird colonies...\\"Rauzon 2001, p.123. The symptoms of Q fever overlap significantly with those of Laysan fever, and scientists have speculated as to their possible common causes.Rauzon 2001, p.125. Possible ancient Hawaiian presence In 2003, an archaeologist examining sediment cores found pollen from coconut palms deep below the bottom of the central lagoon. This unexpected find raises several issues. Heretofore, no evidence existed that the coconut ever reached any of the Hawaiian Islands before the arrival of the Polynesian voyagers. Further, there has never been any physical evidence that the ancient Hawaiians extended their explorations of the Hawaiian chain beyond Nihoa and Mokumanamana (Necker). Dating the sediment containing the Cocos pollen is imprecise, but appears to be somewhere between 5,500 years ago, and the arrival of Europeans in Hawaiian waters in the late 18th century. The full length of the core was and is thought to represent a record spanning 7,000 years. Coconut pollen was not found in the deeper (older) part of the core. However, cores from Guam in the western Pacific show the presence of coconut trees there as early as 9,000 years ago, well before human habitation. Hawaiian traditions suggest that the Hawaiians were aware that islands existed to the northwest, and the pollen evidence could be interpreted as proof of early Hawaiian visitation to Laysan. Clearly, more precise dating of the sediment layers will be crucial to better interpreting this find.TenBruggencate 2005 Distinctive species of Laysan A Laysan duck mother and her ducklings. Laysan is generally regarded as the \\"gem\\" of the NWHI, with the most biodiversity. It is home to the Laysan duck, the rarest duck in the world.Liittschwager 2005, p.131. The other native land bird of Laysan is the Laysan finch, an opportunistic hunter. Eighteen other bird species nest here and use Lake Laysan, the only lake in the NWHI, as a rest stop or breeding ground. Laysan also has its share of native plants, many of which, such as Eragrostis variabilis, were extirpated from Laysan during its extinction period and then reintroduced by scientists afterwards, from other leeward islands.Liittschwager 2005, p.128.

He studied theology for a short time at Leipzig, and afterwards philology at Wittenberg, where he received a Ph.D. in 1812. While still a student in 1811, he had already published a work on public libraries. In 1812, he published another work entitled Hierarchiae in religionem ac literas commoda, which roughly translates to “Hierarchy in religion and letters advantages.” In 1813, he was attached to the Leipzig University library, and in 1814 was appointed secretary to the Royal Library of Dresden. The same year, he published F. Taubmanns Leben und Verdienste and in 1819 Torquato Tasso, a translation from Pierre Louis Ginguené with annotations. The rich resources open to him in the Dresden library enabled him to undertake the work on which his reputation chiefly rests, the Allgemeines bibliographisches Lexikon, the first volume of which appeared in 1821 and the second in 1830. This was the first work of the kind produced in Germany, and the most scientific published anywhere. From 1823 to 1825, Ebert was librarian to the Duke of Brunswick at Wolfenbüttel.

Wallace takes the robot's nightstick as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit. Returning to life, the robot follows Wallace and Gromit. Wallace panics and he and Gromit retreat into the rocket. Unable to climb the ladder, the robot cuts into the fuselage with a can opener and accidentally ignites some fuel. The explosion throws it off the rocket and Wallace and Gromit lift off. Dejected, the robot fashions discarded rocket fuselage into skis and skis across the lunar landscape. It waves goodbye to Wallace and Gromit as they return home. Cast *Peter Sallis as Wallace Production Nick Park started creating the film in 1982, as a graduation project for the National Film and Television School. In 1985, Aardman Animations took him on before he finished the piece, allowing him to work on it part-time while still being funded by the school. To make the film, Park wrote to William Harbutt's company, requesting a long ton of Plasticine. The block he received had ten colours, one of which was called \\"stone\\"; this was used for Gromit. Park wanted to voice Gromit, but he realised the voice he had in mind — that of Peter Hawkins — would have been difficult to animate. For Wallace, Park offered Peter Sallis £50 to voice the character, and his acceptance greatly surprised the young animator. Park wanted Wallace to have a Lancastrian accent like his own, but Sallis could only do a Yorkshire voice. Inspired by how Sallis drew out the word \\"cheese\\", Park chose to give Wallace large cheeks. When Park called Sallis six years later to explain he had completed his film, Sallis swore in surprise. Gromit was named after grommets, because Park's brother, an electrician, often mentioned them, and Nick Park liked the sound of the word. Wallace was originally a postman named Jerry, but Park felt the name did not match well with Gromit. Park saw an overweight Labrador retriever named Wallace, who belonged to an old woman boarding a bus in Preston. Park commented it was a \\"funny name, a very northern name to give a dog\\". According to the book The World of Wallace and Gromit, original plans were that the film would be forty minutes long, including a sequence where Wallace and Gromit would discover a fast food restaurant on the Moon. Regarding the original plot, Park said: Home media The short film was released on VHS in the 1990s by BBC Video. It was also released on DVD multiple times, as part of the Wallace and Gromit in 3 Amazing Adventures series of DVDs. In the United States, it was released on DVD in 2009 by Lionsgate VOD and HiT Entertainment. In the United Kingdom, it was again released on DVD in the 2000s. Release The short premiered on 4 November 1989 at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, UK, and premiered in the United States on 18 May 1990. It was also shown on Channel 4 on 24 December 1990 in the UK. Reception =Awards and nominations= In 1991, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but it lost to the short Creature Comforts, which was also a creation of Nick Park.

The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989. It now covers . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region. Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted (Scots pine) and shrublike (Norway spruce). These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities. Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland. The Kovero Farm (), a tenant farm established in 1859, is part of the cultural heritage area of the park. Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on June 19, 1996. It was valid until June 2011. Fauna The mires – that cover more than half of the park's area – are inhabited by black grouses, common cranes, whooper swans, wood sandpipers and northern willow grouses. The old-growth forests house hole nesters such as Eurasian pygmy owls, Ural owls, three-toed woodpeckers, red- breasted flycatchers and the Siberian flying squirrel. The emblem species and the most common species in the park is the pine marten.

In 2000, Greengard, Arvid Carlsson and Eric Kandel were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system. He was Vincent Astor Professor at Rockefeller University, and served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Cure Alzheimer's Fund, as well as the Scientific Council of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. He was married to artist Ursula von Rydingsvard. Biography Greengard was born in New York City, the son of Pearl (née Meister) and Benjamin Greengard, a vaudeville comedian. His older sister was actress Irene Kane, who later became a writer by the name of Chris Chase; she died in 2013, aged 89. Their mother died in childbirth and their father remarried in 1927. The Greengard siblings' parents were Jewish, but their stepmother was Episcopalian. He and his sister were \\"brought up in the Christian tradition\\".Profile of Paul Greengard, nobelprize.org; accessed December 28, 2013. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as an electronics technician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working on an early warning system against Japanese kamikaze planes. After World War II, he attended Hamilton College where he graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics. He decided against graduate school in physics because most post-war physics research was focusing on nuclear weapons, and instead became interested in biophysics. Greengard began his graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the lab of Haldan Keffer Hartline. Inspired by a lecture by Alan Hodgkin, Greengard began work on the molecular and cellular function of neurons. He received his PhD in 1953 and began postdoctoral work at the University of London, Cambridge University, and the University of Amsterdam. Greengard then became director of the Department of Biochemistry at the Geigy Research Laboratories. After leaving Geigy in 1967, he worked briefly at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Vanderbilt University before taking a position as Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Yale University. In 1983 he joined the faculty of The Rockefeller University. Greengard was a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. He was the acting chairman of the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation and served on the board of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Research Foundation, which later merged with The Michael J. Fox Foundation.. Both internationally renowned foundations support the research conducted in the Greengard laboratory at The Rockefeller University. He died on April 13, 2019. Research Greengard's research focused on events inside the neuron caused by neurotransmitters. Specifically, Greengard and his fellow researchers studied the behavior of second messenger cascades that transform the docking of a neurotransmitter with a receptor into permanent changes in the neuron. In a series of experiments, Greengard and his colleagues showed that when dopamine interacts with a receptor on the cell membrane of a neuron, it causes an increase in cyclic AMP inside the cell. This increase of cyclic AMP, in turn activates a protein called protein kinase A, which turns other proteins on or off by adding phosphate groups in a reaction known as phosphorylation. The proteins activated by phosphorylation can then perform a number of changes in the cell: transcribing DNA to make new proteins, moving more receptors to the synapse (and thus increasing the neuron's sensitivity), or moving ion channels to the cell surface (and thus increasing the cell's excitability). He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Arvid Carlsson and Eric Kandel for his work on the central regulatory protein DARPP-32. Family Paul Greengard had two sons from his first marriage, Claude and Leslie. Claude Greengard holds a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley, and is the Founder of Foss Hill Partners. Leslie holds an MD from the Yale School of Medicine and a PhD in computer science from Yale University, and is a professor of mathematics and computer science at and director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, a winner of the Steele Prize for a seminal contribution to research, a recipient of both a Packard Foundation Fellowship and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, and a member of both the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. In 1985, Paul Greengard married internationally renowned sculptor Ursula von Rydingsvard, who has received numerous awards and grants, including two awards from the National Endowment of the Arts, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, and three awards from the American section of the International Association of Art Critics. von Rydingsvard is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and her artworks are among the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Brooklyn Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art and the Walker Art Center. Discrimination complaints In February 2018, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found The Rockefeller University liable for discrimination based on race and national origin which occurred in 2007 in the lab of, and under the supervision of, Greengard. Pearl Meister Greengard Prize Paul Greengard used his Nobel Prize honorarium to help fund the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize, an award for women scientists. The award is named after his mother, who died during childbirth. It was established in 2004 to shine a spotlight on exceptional women in science, since, as Greengard observed, \\"[women] are not yet receiving awards and honors at a level commensurate with their achievements.\\" The annual prize is awarded to an outstanding woman conducting biomedical research.

It was the first novel (but not published work of fiction) set in Reynolds's eponymous universe. The novel reflects Reynolds's professional background: he has a PhD in astronomy and worked for many years for the European Space Agency. It was short listed for the 2000 BSFA and Arthur C. Clarke Awards. Summary Revelation Space begins with three seemingly- unrelated narrative strands that merge as the novel progresses. This plot structure is characteristic of many of Reynolds's works. The first strand centres around Dan Sylveste, beginning in the year 2551. Sylveste is an archaeologist excavating the remains of the long-dead Amarantin race. Over the course of decades, Sylveste learns that the Amarantin may have become technologically sophisticated before their sun destroyed life on the planet Resurgam nearly a million years prior. The next strand centres around Ilia Volyova aboard the Nostalgia for Infinity, a large ship capable of interstellar travel. Volyova and the other members of her skeleton crew wish to find Sylveste because they believe he can help them with their captain, who has been infected with the Melding Plague, a nanotech virus that attacks human cells and machine implants to pervert them into grotesque combinations. The third strand focuses on Ana Khouri, an assassin living on the planet Yellowstone (in the Epsilon Eridani system). Khouri is hired by a mysterious figure known as the Mademoiselle to assassinate Sylveste. With help from the Mademoiselle, Khouri infiltrates the crew of the Nostalgia for Infinity as it reaches orbit around Yellowstone, knowing that they will then travel to Resurgam. The Nostalgia for Infinity arrives in orbit around Resurgam in 2566. Desperate to secure Sylveste's expertise to help cure her captain, Volyova and the other two members of the ship's ruling triumvirate (Sajaki and Hegazi) threaten the defenceless Resurgam civilisation, prompting its rulers to turn Sylveste over to them. Once aboard, however, Sylveste informs the triumvirs that he has antimatter bombs hidden inside the implants in his artificial eyes that could destroy the Nostalgia for Infinity. He then agrees to attempt to cure their captain in exchange for a trip to Cerberus, a mysterious nearby planet that he believes holds the secret to the truth of Amarantin civilisation. They soon discover that Cerberus is actually a massive beacon aimed at alerting a machine sentience of the appearance of new star-faring cultures so that it can destroy them. It is that sentience, Sylveste belatedly realises, that caused the demise of the Amarantin. Publication history As this was Alastair Reynolds's first published hardback or hardcover fiction, and was published in a relatively small initial print run in the United Kingdom, it subsequently became a collectible first edition. Reception Thomas M. Wagner of SF Reviews wrote that \\"despite my disappointment, images and bits and pieces of the novel simply would not get out of my head. This is saying something, since, with the volume of SF and fantasy I read, I do not exactly retain an eidetic memory of everything I've read that I can call up in a second or two unless the book literally bowled me over. But in the case of Revelation Space, two and three years later I still could remember the opening scene in the archaeological dig on the lonely planet of Resurgam with remarkable clarity. The dark, eerie corridors of the vast starship Nostalgia for Infinity still brought haunting images to mind.\\" A Dragonsworn review notes \\"there's plenty of beautifully scripted action sequences, and gorgeous descriptions—especially where the Nostalgia for Infinity is concerned. Reynolds paints a vivid picture of a haunting machine in decline, and a crew that may as well be ghosts.\\" while observing the lack of character development.

It deals with themes of identity, memory, and immortality, and many of its scenes are concerned primarily with describing the unusual societal and physical structure of the titular city, a major nexus of Reynolds's universe. It won the 2002 British Science Fiction Association award. Synopsis Chasm City is framed and largely written in the voice of Tanner Mirabel, a security expert who has come to Chasm City to avenge the death of his former client's wife at the hands of a \\"postmortal\\" noble named Argent Reivich. Tanner arrives to find that Yellowstone, the most advanced civilization in human history, has descended into squalor; an alien nanotech virus known as the Melding Plague has wreaked havoc throughout the system. Chasm City, a dense forest of mile-high shapeshifting skyscrapers, has melted into a slum. The Glitter Band, a sparkling diorama of ten thousand orbital habitats, has been reduced to a \\"Rust Belt\\" of a few hundred survivors, mostly primitive and pre-nanotech antiques. In this chaos of plague and desolation, Tanner seeks his prey, only to discover that Reivich is more clever than he originally thought. In the midst of his hunt, he begins experiencing virus-induced flashbacks from the life of Sky Haussmann, the founder of his home world, Sky's Edge, who is both revered and reviled for the crimes he committed for his people. From the depths of the gas plume at the heart of Chasm City, to the aristocratic canopy spanning what remains of the skyscrapers, Mirabel begins to unravel the mystery of the Melding Plague.

It is a low, flat sand and coral island about 905 nautical miles (1,676 km) northwest of Honolulu. The island is surrounded by reefs and shoals, including the extensive Neva Shoals. Access to the island is limited by helicopter or by boat to a narrow sandy inlet on the southeastern side of the island. Geology and topography The island is made of limestone that caps the submerged summit of an extinct shield volcano that was active about 20 million years ago. Lisianski Island is undergoing the slow process of erosion, and features a depression between two tall sand dunes, that is thought to once have been a lagoon like the one on Laysan, its nearest neighbor. For this reason, the island's selected Hawaiian name, Papa‘āpoho, means \\"island with a depression\\". Over three-quarters of the Bonin petrels that nest in Hawaii nest here. Recent discovery of subfossils on the island indicate that Laysan duck populations occurred on the island, possibly as a result of the former lagoon. The Island is named after Yuri Lisyansky, native Ukrainian explorer and an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy. Lisianski was the commanding officer of the Russian- American Company's merchant sloop Neva, which was on an exploration mission as part of the first Russian circumnavigation of the world when she ran aground on the island in 1805. Lisianski reported the island to be of little interest, except insofar as its surrounding reefs and shoals posed a threat to passing vessels. King Kamehameha IV claimed the island for the Hawaiian Kingdom on 10 May 1857. In 1890, the North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Company acquired a twenty-year lease on the island from the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1909, Lisianski became part of the new Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation established by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Prior to this, there had been concern about the poaching of birds on the island.\\"Lisianski Island and Neva Shoals\\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The book is written like a diary. Its protagonist is Misty Wilmot, a once-promising young artist currently working as a waitress in a hotel. Her husband, a contractor, is in a coma after a suicide attempt. According to the description on the back of Diary, Misty \\"soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives.\\" Diary loosely falls into the modern horror genre, putting aside violence and shock tactics in favour of psychological scares and dark humor. The audio version of Diary is narrated by actress Martha Plimpton. Plot summary Diary takes the form of a \\"coma diary\\" telling the story of Misty Marie Wilmot as her husband lies senseless in a hospital after a suicide attempt. The story is not exactly told by Misty but through a second-person perspective instead. Once she was an art student dreaming of creativity and freedom, but now, after marrying her husband Peter while they were both still at school and then giving birth to their daughter shortly after, she is eventually brought back to Waytansea Island, a place that was once-quaint but is now tourist-overrun. Misty has been reduced to the lowly condition of a mere waitress within a common resort hotel. Peter, before falling into his coma, was building hidden rooms within the houses he was remodeling and scrawling vile messages all over the walls; this is an old habit of builders but it's been dramatically overdone in Peter's case. Angry homeowners are suing Misty left and right and her dreams of artistic greatness have been ruined. But then, as if she was possessed by the spirit of the fabled Waytansea artist Maura Kincaid, Misty begins painting again, excessively and compulsively. Misty discovers that the islanders, including her father-in-law (previously thought to be dead) are involved in a conspiracy which repeats every four generations. A young artist (in this case Misty) is lured to the island by an old piece of jewelry, she becomes pregnant and has her child within the community. It is implied that this old jewelry works to lure and entrap Misty because it was hers in a past life, during which these same events played out before. During middle age, her husband dies, followed by all her children, resulting in a wave of great artistic creativity, the product of which is mesmerizing to the observing audience. The islanders create an exhibition of Misty's art work at the local hotel where a fire is started by Misty's daughter, who is revealed to be alive after a previous point in the book when she was thought to have drowned, and all the hotel's occupants are burned to death due to their being mesmerized by her painting. The result is a huge insurance claim which leaves the remaining island citizens wealthy enough to support their luxuriant lifestyles for the next four generations, at which point a new young artist will be found to repeat the cycle. Peter, Misty's husband, attempted to warn her of this plot using his hidden writing and it is revealed that his suicide attempt was in fact a murder attempt. It is never revealed in the end whether Peter recovered from his coma, but from Misty's descriptions of his state of health, he more than likely died. Characters The names of the main characters are taken from fans' names selected at random in an official contest held by \\"The Cult\\" on the ChuckPalaniuk.net website prior to publication. ; Misty Marie Wilmot : The protagonist. Her maiden name is Kleinman. Misty was raised in a trailer park in Tecumseh Lake, Georgia by her hippie mother. She is an aspiring artist and attends art school where she eventually meets and begins going out with Peter Wilmot. Peter does everything in his power to get her pregnant, and they eventually go live with his family on Waytansea Island after his father, Harrow Wilmot, dies. Misty puts off her artistic aspirations to raise Tabitha. Misty eventually discovers that she is the reincarnation of past artists, including Maura Kincaid and Constance Burton. ; Peter Wilmot : After moving back to Waytansea Island, Peter takes up the job of contractor. He is found in the family car by Misty, supposedly having attempted suicide. It eventually turns out that he was the victim of attempted murder by his own father, whom Misty had thought was dead and who was trying to stop him from spoiling the islanders' plan to use Misty's artwork to get rich. The murder attempt was a failure, and Peter now lies comatose in a hospital bed. ; Tabitha Wilmot : Referred to throughout most of the book as Tabbi, Tabitha is the daughter of Misty and Peter. She plays the part of a loving child throughout most of the story, eventually faking her death so as to cause her mother emotional pain which would help Misty to create art. After it is revealed to Misty that Tabitha is still alive, she learns that Tabitha smokes, flirts with boys, and is not as loving, sweet, or innocent a child as she'd previously thought. ; Grace Wilmot : Grace is the mother of Peter and \\"Granmy\\" to Tabitha. Misty is often annoyed by her, whether it's the way she wastes Misty's money, or the way she's influencing Tabitha. Grace is often found with a diary, which it turns out is not of Grace's writings, but rather that of a dead artist from a century back by the name of Constance Burton. Grace eventually dies in a fire in the hotel along with more than a hundred other persons on the night of the unveiling of Misty's artwork. ; Harrow Wilmot : Referred to most often by the nickname Harry, Harrow was the father of Peter and husband of Grace. Misty uses him to judge in advance what Peter will eventually look like. Although Misty loved him, throughout most of the book, Misty believes he is dead, as that is what Peter, Grace, and the doctor have all told her (despite none of them telling her the same thing as his cause-of-death). Toward the end of the book, it is discovered that Harrow is actually alive, and that his death has been faked. But he dies not long after, along with Grace in the burning hotel. ; Angel Delaporte : Angel is a wealthy man who comes to live on the island. He is quite interested in graphology, and he and Misty go around to the various houses in which Peter has done construction work to see what sort of messages Peter has painted on the walls of these houses. It is eventually revealed that Peter was actually bisexual and in love with Angel. Angel is killed by the island-folk, stabbed to death by Harry while he slept. ; Detective Clark Stilton : Stilton is the only member of the Seaview County Hate Crimes Task Force. He is investigating the acts of an anti-tourist terrorist group known as the Ocean Alliance for Freedom (OAFF). He arrests Misty under suspicion of murder and arson. That night, he dies in the hotel fire. ; Daniel Touchet, M.D. : Dr. Touchet (pron: \\"tü-ˈshā\\") is the main, if not only, doctor on the island. He has delivered most of the younger residents of the island, including Peter, Tabitha, Paulette Hyland (then Paulette Petersen), Will Tupper, Matt Hyland, and Brett Petersen. He also prepares the bodies of the dead for funeral, and performs cremations. When Misty has a migraine, she goes to Dr. Touchet, who tells her about the Jain Buddhists, the Essene Jews, and the early Christians, and gives her some capsules which he claims contain \\"green algae mostly, some white willow bark, [and] a little bee pollen.\\" When Misty trips, the doctor tells her she has injured her knee and that she must stay in her room for three weeks, affording her the opportunity to paint. When Angel tries to help her escape, he tells her he had the pill tested, and that it contained powdered lead with trace amounts of arsenic and mercury, each of which are traditional ingredients in artistry paints linked to accidental self-poisoning. =Other characters= ; Mrs. Burton, Mrs. Seymour, and Mrs. Perry : These three islanders are referred to in Misty's diary as \\"local sea turtles.\\" ; Raymon : A busboy at the hotel. ; Maura Kincaid and Constance Burton : Two dead artists, both female, who had come to live on Waytansea Island in much the same manner as Misty. The islanders believe that Misty is the reincarnation of these artists, as well as others, and Misty herself comes to believe this. Both Maura and Constance have left clues around the island for their future incarnations, including little messages written in the island's library books. ; Mrs. Terrymore : The old librarian, who diligently erases messages from Maura and Constance when she finds them in the books. ; Paulette Hyland : The desk clerk at the hotel, whose maiden name is Petersen. ; Will Tupper : A friend of Peter who now is bald and runs the ferryboat between the island and the mainland. Back in college, he had blonde hair, and had ripped an earring from his ear to give to Misty. He still has scar-tissue from this incident. ; The Ocean Alliance for Freedom : OAFF for short, this was the name Harrow (and possibly other islanders) gave himself when he committed murder and arson so that the police would suspect the murders and arsonry were the act of militant radical leftists, rather than an act of conspiracy with the whole island. Stilton, a member of the Seaview County Hate Crimes Task Force, is brought onto the case as it is noticed that OAFF only attacks mainlanders. On page 155, Stilton says \\"The white supremacy movement and the Green Party have connections going way back. It's not a long stretch from protecting nature to preserving racial purity.\\" ; Nora Adams : Nora appears on the last page of the book in a letter form. Towards the end of the book, Misty states that she and Tabbi will change their names (hence the Nora Adams) and move to Tecumseh Lake, GA. The address where the letter is sent is from Tecumseh, GA. Cover The dust jacket of the first edition of Diary contains a hidden printed message. The inside of the jacket is printed black, with white letters printed vertically across the jacket from bottom to top, in the same style of writing as the title on the cover.

The book was a best-seller in the authors‘ native Austria and Germany and went on to be a worldwide bestseller with over 800,000 copies sold and translated into 27 languages. In particular, the book is known for defining a possible \\"20/80 society\\". In this possible society of the 21st century, 20 percent of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going. The other 80 percent live on some form of welfare and are entertained with a concept called \\"tittytainment\\", which aims at keeping the 80 percent of frustrated citizens happy with a mixture of deadeningly predictable, lowest common denominator entertainment for the soul and nourishment for the body. Contents The book deals mainly with the effects of globalization. It describes a growing social divide as a result of \\"delimitation\\" of the economy and a loss of political control by the state over the economic development, which is increasingly controlled by global corporations. The authors warn of a so-called \\"20-to-80-society\\". They describe how a global 80:20 distribution already exists in many aspects, and illustrate possible economic, social and political consequences of free trade and deregulated financial markets. In the beginning, they describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents from September 27 - October 1, 1995 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, the term \\"one-fifth-society\\" arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one-fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work. The authors predict huge number of unemployed, perhaps finding themselves in low-paid voluntary community services to boost their morale.

Magnetic storage or magnetic recording is the storage of data on a magnetized medium. Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetisation in a magnetizable material to store data and is a form of non- volatile memory. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads. Magnetic storage media, primarily hard disks, are widely used to store computer data as well as audio and video signals. In the field of computing, the term magnetic storage is preferred and in the field of audio and video production, the term magnetic recording is more commonly used. The distinction is less technical and more a matter of preference. Other examples of magnetic storage media include floppy disks, magnetic recording tape, and magnetic stripes on credit cards.  History  Magnetic storage in the form of wire recording—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of Electrical World. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) magnetic recorder was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first magnetic tape recorder. Early magnetic storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record digital data. In old computers, magnetic storage was also used for primary storage in a form of magnetic drum, or core memory, core rope memory, thin film memory, twistor memory or bubble memory. Unlike modern computers, magnetic tape was also often used for secondary storage.  Design  Hard drives use magnetic memory to store giga- and terabytes of data in computers. Information is written to and read from the storage medium as it moves past devices called read-and-write heads that operate very close (often tens of nanometers) over the magnetic surface. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetisation of the material immediately under it. There are two magnetic polarities, each of which is used to represent either 0 or 1. The magnetic surface is conceptually divided into many small sub-micrometer-sized magnetic regions, referred to as magnetic domains, (although these are not magnetic domains in a rigorous physical sense), each of which has a mostly uniform magnetisation. Due to the polycrystalline nature of the magnetic material each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains. Magnetic grains are typically 10 nm in size and each form a single true magnetic domain. Each magnetic region in total forms a magnetic dipole which generates a magnetic field. In older hard disk drive (HDD) designs the regions were oriented horizontally and parallel to the disk surface, but beginning about 2005, the orientation was changed to perpendicular to allow for closer magnetic domain spacing . Older hard disk drives used iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) as the magnetic material, but current disks use a cobalt-based alloy. For reliable storage of data, the recording material needs to resist self-demagnetisation, which occurs when the magnetic domains repel each other. Magnetic domains written too close together in a weakly magnetisable material will degrade over time due to rotation of the magnetic moment of one or more domains to cancel out these forces. The domains rotate sideways to a halfway position that weakens the readability of the domain and relieves the magnetic stresses. A write head magnetises a region by generating a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise the region and to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed \\"giant\\" magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically magneto-resistive while the write element is typically thin-film inductive. The heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter; that air moves at or near the platter speed. The record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of air bearing.  Magnetic recording classes  = Analog recording = Analog recording is based on the fact that remnant magnetisation of a given material depends on the magnitude of the applied field. The magnetic material is normally in the form of tape, with the tape in its blank form being initially demagnetised. When recording, the tape runs at a constant speed. The writing head magnetises the tape with current proportional to the signal. A magnetisation distribution is achieved along the magnetic tape. Finally, the distribution of the magnetisation can be read out, reproducing the original signal. The magnetic tape is typically made by embedding magnetic particles (approximately 0.5 micrometers in size) in a plastic binder on polyester film tape. The most commonly-used of these was ferric oxide, though chromium dioxide, cobalt, and later pure metal particles were also used. Analog recording was the most popular method of audio and video recording. Since the late 1990s, however, tape recording has declined in popularity due to digital recording. = Digital recording = Instead of creating a magnetisation distribution in analog recording, digital recording only needs two stable magnetic states, which are the +Ms and -Ms on the hysteresis loop. Examples of digital recording are floppy disks and hard disk drives (HDDs). Digital recording has also been carried out on tapes. However, HDDs offer superior capacities at reasonable prices; at the time of writing (2020), consumer-grade HDDs offer data storage at about $0.03 per GB. Recording media in HDDs use a stack of thin films to store information and a read/write head to read and write information to and from the media; various developments have been carried out in the area of used materials.Developments in Data Storage, ed. S.N. Piramanayagam and Tow C. Chong, IEEE-Wiley Press (2012). = Magneto-optical recording = Magneto-optical recording writes/reads optically. When writing, the magnetic medium is heated locally by a laser, which induces a rapid decrease of coercive field. Then, a small magnetic field can be used to switch the magnetisation. The reading process is based on magneto-optical Kerr effect. The magnetic medium are typically amorphous R-Fe-Co thin film (R being a rare earth element). Magneto-optical recording is not very popular. One famous example is Minidisc developed by Sony. = Domain propagation memory = Domain propagation memory is also called bubble memory. The basic idea is to control domain wall motion in a magnetic medium that is free of microstructure. Bubble refers to a stable cylindrical domain. Data is then recorded by the presence/absence of a bubble domain. Domain propagation memory has high insensitivity to shock and vibration, so its application is usually in space and aeronautics.  Technical details  = Access method = Magnetic storage media can be classified as either sequential access memory or random access memory, although in some cases the distinction is not perfectly clear. The access time can be defined as the average time needed to gain access to stored records. In the case of magnetic wire, the read/write head only covers a very small part of the recording surface at any given time. Accessing different parts of the wire involves winding the wire forward or backward until the point of interest is found. The time to access this point depends on how far away it is from the starting point. The case of ferrite-core memory is the opposite. Every core location is immediately accessible at any given time. Hard disks and modern linear serpentine tape drives do not precisely fit into either category. Both have many parallel tracks across the width of the media and the read/write heads take time to switch between tracks and to scan within tracks. Different spots on the storage media take different amounts of time to access. For a hard disk this time is typically less than 10 ms, but tapes might take as much as 100 s.  Coding schemes  Magnetic disk heads and magnetic tape heads cannot pass DC (direct current). So the coding schemes for both tape and disk data are designed to minimize the DC offset. Allen Lloyd. \\"Complete Electronic Media Guide\\". 2004\\\\. p. 22. Most magnetic storage devices use error correction. Many magnetic disks internally use some form of run-length limited coding and partial-response maximum-likelihood.  Current usage  , common uses of magnetic storage media are for computer data mass storage on hard disks and the recording of analog audio and video works on analog tape. Since much of audio and video production is moving to digital systems, the usage of hard disks is expected to increase at the expense of analog tape. Digital tape and tape libraries are popular for the high capacity data storage of archives and backups. Floppy disks see some marginal usage, particularly in dealing with older computer systems and software. Magnetic storage is also widely used in some specific applications, such as bank cheques (MICR) and credit/debit cards (mag stripes).  Future  A new type of magnetic storage, called magnetoresistive random-access memory or MRAM, is being produced that stores data in magnetic bits based on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Its advantage is non-volatility, low power usage, and good shock robustness. The 1st generation that was developed was produced by Everspin Technologies, and utilized field induced writing. The 2nd generation is being developed through two approaches: thermal-assisted switching (TAS) which is currently being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working. However, with storage density and capacity orders of magnitude smaller than an HDD, MRAM is useful in applications where moderate amounts of storage with a need for very frequent updates are required, which flash memory cannot support due to its limited write endurance. Six state MRAM is also being developed, echoing four bit multi level flash memory cells, that have six different bits, as opposed to two. Research is also being done by Aleksei Kimel at Radboud UniversityAlexey Kimel University page towards the possibility of using terahertz radiation rather than using standard electropulses for writing data on magnetic storage media. By using terahertz radiation, writing time can be reduced considerably (50x faster then when using standard electropulses). Another advantage is that terahertz radiation generates almost no heat, thus reducing cooling requirements.Kijk magazine, 12, 2019  See also  * Digital Audio Tape * Digital Data Storage * Disk storage * Karlqvist gap * Magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) * Magnetic recording methods: ** Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) ** Longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR) ** Perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) - also known as: Conventional magnetic recording (CMR) ** Shingled magnetic recording (SMR) * Marvin Camras  References   External links  * A History of Magnetic Recording (BBC/H2G2) * Selected History of Magnetic Recording * Oberlin Smith and the Invention of Magnetic Sound Recording * History of Magnetic Recording on the UC San Diego web site (CMRR). * A Chronology of Magnetic Recording. * \\" Science Reporter, VOLUME 43 NUMBER 7 JULY 2006 \\"Magnetic Recording a Revolutionary Technology\\" * Category:American inventions Category:Storage media Category:Computer storage media Category:Magnetic devices ","title":"Magnetic storage"},{"id":"896360","text":"Eric Anundsson or Eymundsson was a legendary Swedish king who supposedly ruled during the 9th century. The Norse sagas describe him as successful in extending his realm over the Baltic Sea, but unsuccessful in his attempts of westward expansion. There is no near-contemporary evidence for his existence, the sources for his reign dating from the 13th and 14th centuries. These sources, Icelandic sagas, are generally not considered reliable sources for the periods and events they describe. Controversially, older Swedish historians have identified Eric with another legendary Swedish king, Erik Weatherhat, who is mentioned in some medieval king-lists as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious.Prosaiska krönikan, p. 231 ; Strinnholm, A.M. (1834) Svenska folkets historia från äldsta till närwarande tider, Vol. I. Stockholm: Hörberg, p. 296 However, Saxo Grammaticus identifies Erik Weatherhat with another figure, a son of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks krønike Eric's reign He is given as the son of Anund Uppsale in the Hervarar saga (13th century): :Eiríkr hét sonr Önundar konungs, er ríki tók eptir föður sinn at Uppsölum; hann var ríkr konungr. Á hans dögum hófst til ríkis í Noregi Haraldr hárfagri, er fyrstr kom einvaldi í Noreg sinna ættmanna. :Eric was the son of king Anund, and he succeeded his father at Uppsala; he was a rich king. During his reign, Harald Fairhair came to power in Norway, Harald was the first of his kin to reign as a monarch in Norway.Ellehöj, Svend (1965) Studier over den aeldste norröne historieskrivning. Copenhagen: Munksgaard, pp. 98–9. However, the Eric who was contemporary with Harald Fairhair is called Eymundsson by Snorri Sturluson.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 14 Since the preceding king Anund is often identified with an Anund who flourished in the 840s and is mentioned by other sources (Rimbert and Adam of Bremen), Anundsson is probably the correct form of the patronym.Vita Ansgari, Chapter 19 The names Eymund and Anund were equivalent enough for the later king Anund Jacob to be called Emund (Eymund), in the Westrogothic law. Consequently, Eric's patronym would not be the only instance where the two names were confused. According to Hervarar saga, he was preceded by his father Anund Uppsale and uncle Björn at Hauge, and later on succeeded by Björn (the father of Eric the Victorious and Olof Björnsson). Landnámabók informs that Eric and his son Björn ruled during the time of the Pope Adrian II and Pope John VIII, i.e. in the period 867–883, the time of the first settlement of Iceland. Harald Fairhair's saga relates that Erik died when Harald Fairhair had been king of all Norway for ten years.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 28 Traditionally this would indicate 882, but Harald's ascent to power is nowadays believed to have occurred later, in the 880s or c. 900.Sveaas Andersen, Per (1977) Samlingen av Norge og kristningen av landet 800—1130. Handbok i Norges historie bind 2. Bergen-Oslo-Tromsø: Universitetsforlaget. Erik is mentioned in several places in the Heimskringla. In the saga of Olaf Haraldsson, Thorgny Lawspeaker relates: :My grandfather Thorgny could well remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, and used to say of him that when he was in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Estonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, moreover, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.Heimskringla, Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 81 Conflict with Harald Fairhair In Harald Fairhair's saga, Snorri Sturluson relates that Eric also wanted to extend Sweden westwards and to make a kingdom for himself as large as that of the Swedish king Sigurd Hring and his son Ragnar Lodbrok (i.e. Raumarike, Vingulmark and Westfold all the way to the island of Grenmar). Thus he conquered Värmland and all the land south of Svinesund (modern Bohuslän) and claimed the shores of Viken as his own, naming it all West Götaland. He placed Hrane Gautske (Hrane the as Jarl of the land between Svinesund and Göta älv. In these territories the people accepted Erik as their king. When King Harald Fairhair arrived at Tønsberg (in Viken, and at the time a trading town) from Trondheim, he learnt of this and became very angry. He assembled the ting at Fold and accused the people of treason, after which some had to accept his rule, while others were punished. He then spent the summer forcing Viken and Raumarike to accept his rule.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 14 When the winter arrived, Harald learnt that the Swedish king was in Värmland, after which he crossed the Ed forest and ordered the people to arrange feasts for him and his entourage. The most powerful man in the province was a man named Åke, who had formerly been one of Halfdan the Black's men, and he invited both the Norwegian king and the Swedish king to his halls. Åke had built a new hall instead of his old one, which was ornamented in the same splendid manner, but the old hall only had old ornaments and hangings. When the kings arrived, the Swedish king was placed in the old hall, whereas the Norwegian king was placed in the new one. The Norwegian king found himself in a hall with new gilded vessels carved with figures and shining like glass, full of the best liquor. The next day, the kings prepared to leave. Bidding his farewell Åke gave to Harald's service his own twelve-year-old son Ubbe. Harald thanked Åke and promised him his friendship. Then Åke talked to the Swedish king, who was in a bad mood. Åke gave him valuable gifts and followed the king on the road until they came to the woods. Eric asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the old things and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king's man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Eric drew his sword and slew the impudent Åke. When Harald learnt of this, he and his retainers mounted their horses and chased after the Swedish king until they spotted him. When Eric and his men became aware that they were pursued, they rode as hard as they could until they had reached the wood that divided Värmland and Götaland. At this point Harald considered it best to return. He then spent the rest of the autumn killing all the Swedish king's men in Värmland.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 15 In the winter, Harald plundered and burnt in Rånrike. In the meantime the Geats gathered an army, preparing to resist the Norwegians. When the ice broke up they drove stakes into the Göta älv to stop ships from entering. Nevertheless, the Norwegians invaded Götaland and laid their ships alongside the stakes. The Geats came down to the shore with a sizeable army and gave battle. A lot of people fell, but King Harald gained the victory. He then travelled far and wide in Götaland, winning most of the battles. In one of the battles, Hrane Gautske fell. Harald then proclaimed himself the ruler of all land north of Göta älv and north and west of lake Vänern and placed Guttorm Haraldsson to defend the region with a large force.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 16–17 There were disturbances between Harald and the Geats until King Eric died, ten years after Harald's ascension to power. He was succeeded by his son Björn (III) Eriksson who ruled the Swedes for 50 years.Heimskringla, Harald Fairhair's Saga, Chapter 28–29 Contemporary references to the period The only possibly contemporary source for the war is three scaldic verses said to be composed by King Harald's skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi. One of them states that Harald was the enemy of the Geats and apparently won a victory over them. Another says that Harald subdued land and people south of the sea, and tied his ship to the stakes by the shore, without further specification. The verses mention neither Eric nor any Swedes. The historian Curt Weibull has characterised Eric as historically problematic, and doubted that the Swedes had anything to do with Värmland or West Götaland in the late 9th century.Weibull, Curt (1921) Sverige och dess nordiska grannmakter under den tidigare medeltiden. Lund: Gleerups, pp. 25–35. A late 9th-century geographical account preserved in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript, by Ohthere of Hålogaland, vaguely says that Norway borders \\"to Sweoland at the other side of the mountains, until the southern part of the country, and far up to the north\\". Another account in the same manuscript, by Wulfstan of Hedeby, says that Blekinge, Möre, Öland and Gotland belonged to the Swedes (hyrað to Sweon).Lund, Niels (1983) Ottar og Wulfstan: to rejsebeskrivelser fra vikingetiden. Roskilde: Vikingeskibshallen, pp. 23–5. Other accounts The Flateyjarbók (late 14th century) has a different account about Eric Anundsson. It says that Björn at Haugi was king when Harald Fairhair became king in Norway. His successor Anund then ruled for at least 40 years, being succeeded by his son Eric who ruled for 47 years. Eric married Ingigerd, a daughter of Harald Fairhair. After some time she was to be sacrificed to the gods for unspecified reasons. The Swedes, therefore, brought the queen to an island where the blót would take place. She was however rescued by her brother Halfdan the Black (Junior) and brought to safety. This incident provoked long- time hostilities between Harald and Eric. Later on, Harald's trustee Hauk Håbrok went to Holmgard in Kievan Rus' to make purchases but had an adventurous confrontation with two champions of Eric who stayed there.Flateyjarbók (1860) Christiania: Malling, p. 577, 582 A saga about Harald Fairhair's skalds also mentions a Swedish King Eric who was Harald's enemy; he is however given the patronym \\"Björnsson\\".Munch, P.A.

He either ruled before or together with his two sons Eric and Emund. Virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. Bishop Unni's visit The Archbishopric of Bremen had conducted Christian mission in Central Sweden during the 9th century, but the effort lapsed in the second half of the century for various reasons. The German Kingdom came into closer contact with Scandinavia when King Henry the Fowler defeated the Danes in 934 and gained influence in the important emporium Hedeby in South Jutland.Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius förlag, p. 57-8 (Book I, Chapter 57). The German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen, writing in c. 1075, relates that the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Unni, arrived to Denmark to appoint priests for the churches in the realm.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 58 (Book I, Chapters 58-59). From Denmark he traveled over the Baltic Sea and arrived, with some discomfort, to Birka in the Swedish kingdom. This happened in 935 or 936. According to Adam, almost no Christian teachers had visited Birka for seventy years.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 60 (Book I, Chapter 60). \\"The believer in the Lord went ashore in this port and proceeded to make contact with the population for his unusual purpose. For the Swedes and Geats, or to put it better, the Norsemen, had, during the period of barbaric raids of conquest, when many kings exercised a bloody rule during a few consecutive years, entirely forgotten the Christian religion and could not now be easily persuaded to believe in it. I have heard from the often-quoted King Sweyn (of Denmark, ruled 1047-1076), that the Swedes at this time were ruled by a certain Ring together with his sons Eric and Emund. This is the same Ring who was preceded by Anund, Björn and Olof, about whom one may read in the biography of Ansgar, and others who are not mentioned. And it is likely that the warrior of God, Unni, turned to these kings although they were not believers, and preached the word of God in the land of the Swedes with their permission ... Swedes and Geats, among whom the Holy Ansgar had first spread the seeds of faith, but reverted to paganism, were once again called to faith by the Holy Father UnniAdam av Bremen (1984), p. 60-2 (Book I, Chapter 61). ... When the messenger of God had completed his missionary task and eventually decided to go home, he fell ill in Birka and left his tired body there.\\"Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 62 (Book I, Chapter 62). Name and place Unni died on 17 September 936, though it is unclear if Adam's assertion of him and King Ring being contemporaries is the author's guesswork. King Ring is not mentioned in the Norse king lists and sagas, such as Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks. The name is however borne by the Swedish ruler who was victorious in the legendary Battle of Bråvalla, Sigurd Ring. It is not otherwise attested among the members of the Viking Age royal family. It has sometimes been speculated that his true name was Olof (Anlaufr), represented in Latin chronicles as Anulo, which could have been misinterpreted as Latin annulus, meaning \\"ring\\".Birger Nerman (1916) \\"Torgny lagman\\", Arkiv för nordisk filologi 28 311 ; Carl Bernadotte et al. (eds) (1956), Sveriges hundra konungar. Stockholm: Biblioteksböcker, p. 74-6, 92. There has also been some speculation about the location of Birka where Unni died. A runic inscription on a cross at the church of Sund in Åland has been interpreted by local scholars as Wini (Unni), which would call for a radical reinterpretation of the historical geography of Viking Age Sweden.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 61. The dominating view among historians and archaeologists is nevertheless that Birka was situated on Björkö in Lake Mälaren.Åke Hyenstrand (1996), Lejonet, draken och korset; Sverige 500-1000. Lund: Studentlitteratur. The German encroachment on Scandinavia, which resulted in Unni's visit, may also have alerted the rulers of Birka. The family of Danish rulers who were defeated in 934 is said to have come from Sweden, although this statement has been much- disputed by modern scholars.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 52-3 (Book I, Chapter 48). For an archaeological view of Swedes in Hedeby, see Heiko Steuer (1984), \\"Zur ethnischen Gliederung der Bevölkerung von Haithabu anhand der Gräberfelder\\", p. 209 Niels Lund (1982) \\"Svenskevældet i Hedeby\\", Aarbøger for Nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie 1980 København: Det Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab - Nationalmuseet, p. 114-125. At any rate Birka apparently had strong commercial relations with Hedeby. The fortifications of Birka were strengthened around 940 as the gravel walls were heightened, and palisades seem to have been erected.Carl Bernadotte et al. (eds) (1956), p. 93.

She ranks among the greatest singers of the 20th century, and many opera critics called hers \\"the voice of the century.\\" Desmond Shawe-Taylor wrote of her in the New Grove Dictionary of Opera: \\"No one within living memory surpassed her in sheer beauty and consistency of line and tone.\\" Early life and career Flagstad was born in Hamar, Norway, in her grandparents' home. Though she never actually lived in Hamar, she always considered it her home town. She was raised in Oslo within a musical family; her father Michael Flagstad was a conductor and her mother Maja Flagstad a pianist. She received her early musical training in Oslo and made her stage debut at the National Theatre in Oslo as Nuri in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland in 1913. Her first recordings were made between 1913 and 1915. After further study in Stockholm with Dr. Gillis Bratt, she pursued a career in opera and operetta in Norway. In 1919, she married her first husband Sigurd Hall and a year later gave birth to her only child, a daughter, Else Marie Hall. Later that year she signed up with the newly created Opera Comique in Oslo, under the direction of Alexander Varnay and Benno Singer. Varnay was the father of the famous soprano Astrid Varnay. Her ability to learn roles quickly was noted, as it often took her only a few days to do so. She sang Desdemona opposite Leo Slezak, Minnie, Amelia and other lesser roles at the Opera Comique. She sang at the Stora Teatern of Gothenburg, Sweden, between 1928 and 1934. Flagstad made her debut there singing Agathe in Der Freischütz by Weber. In 1930, a revival of Nielsen's Saul and David featured Flagstad singing the role of Michal. On 31 May 1930 she married her second husband, the Norwegian industrialist and lumber merchant Henry Johansen, who subsequently helped her in expanding her career. In 1932 she made her debut in Rodelinda by Handel. After singing operetta and lyric roles such as Marguerite in Faust for over a decade, Flagstad decided to take on heavier operatic roles such as Tosca and Aida. The part of Aida helped to unleash Flagstad's dramatic abilities. In 1932, she took on the role of Isolde in Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and appeared to have found her true voice. Ellen Gulbranson, a Swedish soprano at Bayreuth, persuaded Winifred Wagner to audition Flagstad for the Bayreuth Festival. Flagstad sang minor roles in 1933, but at the next season in 1934, she sang the roles of Sieglinde in Die Walküre and Gutrune in Götterdämmerung at the Festival, opposite Frida Leider as Brünnhilde. Career at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere Flagstad was first noticed by Otto Hermann Kahn, then Chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Opera, on a trip to Scandinavia in 1929, and Met management made overtures soon after. Their letters were never answered, however. At the time, Flagstad had just met her soon to be second husband and had even briefly considered giving up opera altogether. Then, in the summer of 1934, when the Met needed a replacement for Frida Leider, Flagstad agreed to audition for conductor Artur Bodanzky and Met general manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza in St Moritz in August 1934, and she was engaged immediately. Upon leaving St Moritz, Bodanzky's parting words for Flagstad were \\"Come to New York as soon as you know these roles (Isolde, the three Brünnhildes, Leonore in Fidelio, and the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier). And above all do not go and get fat! Your slender, youthful figure is not the least reason you were engaged.\\"Vogt, Howard. Flagstad: Singer of the Century London: Specker and Warburg, 1987 At the Met Flagstad became a pupil of vocal coach Hermann Weigert, who prepared her for all her roles with the company. Her debut at the Met, as Sieglinde in Die Walküre on the afternoon of 2 February 1935, created a sensation, though it was not planned as a special event. By this time, after weeks of rehearsals, Met management already knew what they had, but they nonetheless decided on a low key debut. Flagstad was unknown in the United States at the time. The performance was, however, broadcast nationwide on the Met's weekly syndicated radio program, and the first inkling of the deluge of critical praise to come was given when intermission host and former Met star Geraldine Farrar discarded her prepared notes, overwhelmed by what she had just heard, and breathlessly announced that a new star had just been born. Days later, Flagstad sang Isolde, and later that month, she performed Brünnhilde in Die Walküre and Götterdämmerung for the first time. Before the end of the season, Flagstad sang Elsa in Lohengrin, Elisabeth in Tannhäuser, and her first Kundry in Parsifal. Almost overnight, she had established herself as the pre-eminent Wagnerian soprano of the era. According to most critics, she still remains the supreme Wagnerian dramatic soprano on disc by virtue of her unique voice. It has been said that she saved the Metropolitan Opera from looming bankruptcy. Her performances, sometimes three or four a week in her early days at the Met, quickly sold out at the box office as soon as they went on sale. Her services to the Met were not from box office receipts alone; her nationwide personal appeals to radio listeners during Saturday matinee intermissions brought thousands of dollars in donations to the Met's coffers. Fidelio (1936 and later) was her only non- Wagnerian role at the Met before the war. In 1935, she performed all three Brünnhildes in the San Francisco Opera's Ring cycle. In 1937, she first appeared at the Chicago City Opera Company.McArthur, Edwin. Flagstad: a personal memoir Da Capo Press, 1980 In 1936 and 1937, Flagstad performed the roles of Isolde, Brünnhilde, and Senta at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, under Sir Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner and Wilhelm Furtwängler, arousing as much enthusiasm there as she had in New York. She also toured Australia in 1938. Hollywood also tried to cash in on Flagstad fever, after her sudden popularity in the US in the mid 1930s, with her many appearances on NBC Radio, The Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby, and regular appearances on CBS's The Ford Sunday Evening Hour. Though Flagstad was not interested in stardom or Hollywood contracts per se, she did make trips to Hollywood during the late 1930s for publicity photo shoots, public appearances, concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and she filmed a rendition of Brünnhilde's Battle Cry from Die Walküre for the Hollywood variety show anthology The Big Broadcast of 1938, in which she was introduced to American film audiences by Bob Hope. Flagstad and Sonja Henie are the only two Norwegians to have their own stars on Hollywood's \\"Walk of Fame\\". Her career at the Met, however, was not without its ups-and- downs. Flagstad got involved in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about \\"stupid publicity photos\\" during a game of bridge in Flagstad's hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two never said a word to each other off stage for the next two years. It was Flagstad's husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace. Flagstad also feuded with the Met's general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky's death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met's new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not hear of it any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; she went over Johnson's head and discussed the matter with the Met's board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde, she received 100 roses, courtesy of Melchior and Johnson. Having received repeated and cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who had returned to Norway a year and a half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless a difficult decision for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the US. Even more importantly, her 20-year- old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against the best advice of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941. Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. The Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad's husband, Henry Johansen, after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen's sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war. Later career Flagstad eventually returned to the Metropolitan Opera, invited by its new general manager, Rudolf Bing, who was furiously criticized for this choice: \\"The greatest soprano of this century must sing in the world's greatest opera house\\", he replied.cited by Bing in his first autobiography, 5,000 Nights at the Met She also returned to Covent Garden following its reopening in 1947 (a rare exception - the Opera House, in lean financial straits following the war- time closure, was attempting to build up a house company of English nationals, principally singing in English, in preference to expensive guest stars). In four consecutive seasons from 1948 to 1952, she sang in all her regular Wagnerian roles, including Kundry and Sieglinde. She toured South America in 1948 and returned to San Francisco in 1949, and finally returned to the Met. In the 1950-1951 season, although she was aged well into her 50s, Flagstad showed herself still in remarkable form as Isolde, Brünnhilde and Leonore. Flagstad visited Jean Sibelius at his home in June 1952. Despite the great fanfare surrounding her return to the Met in early 1951, and her success in resuming her roles there, Flagstad decided that it would be her final year singing Wagner on the stage. She had gained quite a bit of weight since her pre-war years at the Met when she sang those long and physically demanding roles night after night. In 1950, when she accepted Bing's invitation, she felt she did not have the stamina she had had as a younger woman. She had also developed an arthritic hip in mid-1951 (and had to consult doctors in New York); this further made the operatic stage difficult for her, especially when singing Wagner. She gave her farewell operatic performance at the Met on 1 April 1952, not as Brünnhilde or Isolde but in the title role of Gluck's Alceste, a role she had learnt in the war years in Norway. In London she appeared as Dido (another recently learnt role) in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre (in the 1951 Festival of Britain season):Earl of Harewood: Kobbé's Complete Opera Book (Putnam, London 1958 printing), p. 16. the portrayal was recorded (in studio), and issued by EMI in January 1953 (see: Recordings). Her last operatic appearance was as Dido in Oslo on June 5, 1953. During the post-war years, Flagstad was also responsible for the world premiere of Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs. Strauss had written the pieces during his exile in Switzerland following the war (like Flagstad, he had been vilified as a collaborator with the Nazis). He intended them to be premiered by Flagstad, though not because he had her voice in mind. (The songs are better suited to the lyric soprano voice he idealised throughout his life, as exemplified by Elisabeth Schumann and ultimately his wife Pauline de Ahna. Strauss, moreover, had heard praise for Flagstad over the years, but had not heard her sing in person since casting her as the soprano soloist in the 1933 Bayreuth Festival performance of the Beethoven Choral Symphony.) It was, rather, out of sympathy for her difficulties. He sent Flagstad a letter, accompanied by a collection of his own works which he desired her to consider adding to her repertoire, and requested that she give the premiere - together with \\"a first-class conductor and ensemble\\" - of these four new orchestral lieder, at that point still in the publication process. Flagstad accepted the commission, although Strauss did not live to see the premiere. As a conductor, she chose not McArthur (who, though an excellent piano accompanist, was not considered a ‘first-class’ orchestral conductor) but Wilhelm Furtwängler (also experiencing the repercussions of suspect wartime conduct), and the pair chose Walter Legge's Philharmonia Orchestra, with which they both worked well, to provide the accompaniment. By the time of the premiere on 22 May 1950 at London's Royal Albert Hall, Flagstad was almost 55 years old. Her voice by this point was darker, heavier, and more inflexible than when she had sung for Strauss at Bayreuth, and she was becoming reluctant to venture above the staff, as would be notoriously demonstrated in the recording of Tristan und Isolde two years later; the Strauss songs, particularly the Hesse settings, were thus not ideally suited to her resources, and she found herself tested to her limits. \\"Frühling\\" indeed, gave such trouble that Legge, in promoting the concert, was two days before the event advertising the Strauss as \\"three songs with orchestra\\". In the event, Flagstad rose to the occasion and included \\"Frühling\\" (with, however, excluding the highest note), and the close of \\"Im Abendrot\\" was followed by a respectful silence in memory of Strauss. The concert, which aside from the Strauss songs consisted of Wagner (including Isolde's Liebestod and Brünnhilde's Immolation), received favorable reviews; recordings of Flagstad's contributions were made from the radio broadcast, and are today commercially available. Flagstad added \\"September\\", \\"Beim Schlafengehen\\", and \\"Im Abendrot\\" to her repertoire, and recordings (technologically superior to those taken at the premiere) exist of these performed in concert; she did not, however, sing \\"Frühling\\" again.Wilhelm Furtwangler Conducts Strauss - Four Last Songs and Wagner Excerpts (Testament), liner notes. Some controversy surrounds the recording of Vier Letzte Lieder from this occasion, which survives only in a recording of variable quality set down at the receiving end of a radio broadcast. Some sources (including the most recent release, by the Testament label) allege the recording to be of the live performance itself; others allege rather that it is of the dress rehearsal earlier in the day, and state that no surviving recording of the Strauss portion of the concert survives. Whatever the outcome in that regard, the Strauss of the first half does not appear to derive from the source responsible for recording the Wagner of the second half, which exists in altogether better sound, and which is not in any doubt regarding authenticity. After her retirement from the stage, she continued to give concert performances and record – first for EMI (setting down her definitive account of Isolde in the first commercially released account of Tristan und Isolde, and then for Decca Records. She even made some stereophonic recordings, including excerpts from Wagner's operas with Hans Knappertsbusch and Sir Georg Solti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1958, she sang the part of Fricka in Wagner's Das Rheingold, the first instalment in Solti's complete stereophonic set of the Ring Cycle, released by Decca on LP and reel-to-reel tape. She also spent time mentoring young singers in her native country, including contralto Eva Gustavson. From around 1952, when she gave her Met farewell, until her death 10 years later, Flagstad's health steadily deteriorated. She was in and out of hospitals on an increasing basis both in the number and the length of her stays for a variety of ailments. She even joked with an interviewer in 1958 that Oslo hospital had become her home away from home. From 1958 to 1960, Flagstad was the first Director of the Norwegian National Opera. In her last years she gave many benefit concerts throughout Norway. She was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 1960 and died of the disease on 7 December 1962. At her own request she was buried in an unmarked grave in Vestre Gravlund Cemetery in the Frogner borough of Oslo. The largest floral arrangement at her funeral was sent by Lauritz Melchior. Legacy Kirsten Flagstad painted on a Norwegian Air Shuttle airliner. The in Hamar, Norway, contains a private collection of opera artifacts. Her costumes draw special attention, and include several examples on loan from the Metropolitan Opera Archives. Her portrait appeared on the Norwegian 100 kroner bill and on the tail section of Norwegian Air Shuttle planes. \\"That voice! How can one describe it?\\" wrote opera critic Harold C. Schonberg in his New York Times obituary of Flagstad. \\"It was enormous, but did not sound enormous because it was never pushed or out of placement. It had a rather cool silvery quality, and was handled instrumentally, almost as though a huge violin was emitting legato phrases.\\" Incredibly, Flagstad sang the role of Isolde 70 times on the Met stage from 1935 to 1941, making Tristan und Isolde one of the greatest box office attractions in Metropolitan Opera history. Nine of those performances were Saturday matinee radio broadcasts.From the Metropolitan Opera website/Met history/historical archives. See external links. Recordings Of her many recordings, the complete Tristan und Isolde with Furtwängler is considered the finest representation of her interpretive art in its maturity. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest recordings of all time. Throughout her career she recorded numerous songs, by Grieg and others, and these are evidence of a voice that maintained its stable beauty during her many years in the limelight. A comprehensive survey of her recordings was released in several volumes on the Simax label. Her pre-war recordings, which show her voice in its freshest brilliance and clarity, include studio recordings of Wagner arias, Beethoven arias, and Grieg songs, as well as duets from Lohengrin, Parsifal, and Tristan und Isolde with Lauritz Melchior. These have been (and probably still are) available on RCA/BMG CDs, as well as on good CD transfers from the Naxos, Preiser and Romophone companies. Many Metropolitan Opera broadcasts also survive and have circulated among collectors and more recently on CD. These include: *Die Walküre, Act I and fragments from Act II from her 1935 début broadcast; 1937 (as Sieglinde); 1940. *Tristan und Isolde, performances from 1935, 1937, and 1940 all readily available. *Tannhäuser: 1936, with Melchior and Tibbett, 1939, and 1941 (the latter having an official release on Metropolitan Opera LPs). *Siegfried: 1937, with Lauritz Melchior and Friedrich Schorr (available on Naxos and Guild labels). *Lohengrin: 1937, with René Maison *Fidelio: 1941 with Bruno Walter (available on Naxos) *Alceste: 1952 (available on Walhall) After World War II, many important studio recordings followed including: *Wagner Scenes including the final duet from Siegfried (Testament CDs, licensed from EMI) *Götterdämmerung: Final Scene, with Furtwängler - EMI *Tristan und Isolde: Complete opera with Furtwängler - EMI *Norwegian Songs: EMI *Götterdämmerung: with Fjeldstad and Bjoner and Set Svanholm. 1956 - Urania and Walhall. *Der Ring des Nibelungen: Gebhard. From Teatro alla Scala with Furtwängler, Lorenz, Svanholm, Frantz. 1950 Perhaps her most famous operatic recording is the 1952 Tristan with Furtwängler, which has never been out of print. It is available from EMI and Naxos, among others. Because she was aged 57, she was unsure of her capacity to reach the top Cs in Act II, and agreed to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf providing her voice for this purpose.Naxos, Notes to Tristan und Isolde. Retrieved 11 December 2015 Another two Tristans of note are two live performances: from London on 18 May and 2 June 1936, with Lauritz Melchior as Tristan, Emanuel List as Marke, Sabine Kalter as Brangäne, and Herbert Janssen as Kurwenal, conducted by Fritz Reiner leading the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and from the Teatro Colón (Buenos Aires) on 20 August 1948, with Set Svanholm as Tristan, Viorica Ursuleac as Brangäne, Hans Hotter as Kurwenal, and Ludwig Weber as Marke, conducted by Erich Kleiber. Two live concerts are of particular historical significance: *Four Last Songs (Richard Strauss, world premiere), with excerpts from Tristan und Isolde and Götterdämmerung, (Philharmonia Orchestra, cond. Wilhelm Furtwängler), London 22 May 1950. (Testament) *Carnegie Hall American farewell concert (Symphony of the Air, cond. McArthur), 20 March 1955. (Includes Die Walküre Act I excerpts; Götterdämmerung final scene, Tristan Liebestod, and Wesendonck Lieder (orchestral version).) (World Records LP T-366-7.) *Flagstad's celebrated 1951 appearance at the Mermaid Theatre, London in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas is represented by a cast recording in which the Mermaid Belinda (Maggie Teyte) was replaced by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, but under the original direction of Geraint Jones. (HMV ALP 1026, EMG review January 1953).E. Sackville-West and D. Shawe-Taylor, The Record Year 2 (Collins, London 1953), 235-6; M. Teyte, Star on the Door (Putnam, London 1958), 184-5. A live performance with Teyte is available on the Walhall label. *The Alceste (original Italian version edited by Geraint Jones) in which she also made a farewell was recorded with Raoul Jobin, Alexander Young, Marion Lowe, Thomas Hemsley, Joan Clark, Rosemary Thayer, Geraint Jones Orchestra and singers, Geraint Jones (Decca LP LXT 5273-5276). (Her part was recorded April 28, April 30, and May 1, 1956.) In 1956, she moved to Decca where in the autumn of her career further important studio recordings followed: *Several albums of Grieg, Sibelius, Brahms, etc., with orchestra and piano *Hymns (traditional Norwegian language hymns) *Wagner arias with Knappertsbusch (stereo) *Acts I and III of Die Walküre (as Sieglinde and Brünnhilde, respectively) as well as the Brünnhilde/Siegmund duet from Act II (these conducted variously by Knappertsbusch and Solti, as a sort of preparation for Decca's complete Ring project). *Her great valedictory as Fricka in the Decca Rheingold of 1958. Almost to the end of her life, Flagstad continued to sing in fine voice, although she increasingly sang mezzo-soprano material or in a mezzo range: besides the Rheingold Fricka (a mezzo role), Decca planned to cast her also as the Walkure Fricka and the Gotterdammerung Waltraute for its complete Ring (in the event, both roles were sung by Christa Ludwig), and also to record her in Brahms’ Four Serious Songs and Alto Rhapsody; that these plans were shelved only by her final illness and death stands as a testament to her superbly consistent vocal abilities, and to the respect and affection in which she was held to the end by record companies and the public.

He is said to have ruled together with his father and his brother Emund in about 936, and later presumably reigned in his own name.Carl Bernadotte et al. (eds) (1956), Sveriges hundra konungar. Stockholm: Biblioteksböcker, p. 93. Reign The name of this king is only known from Adam's work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum from c. 1075. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Unni, was able to arrange church matters in Denmark after the defeat of the Danes at the hands of King Henry the Fowler of Germany in 934.Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius förlag, p. 57-8 (Book I, Chapters 57-59). From Denmark he proceeded to the Swedish trading port Birka in 935 or 936. Referring to information from the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen, Adam states that the Swedes at this time were ruled by a certain Ring and his sons Erik and Emund.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 60 (Book I, Chapter 61). Adam finds it likely that Unni approached these heathen kings and obtained permission to propagate Christianity, which by this time was long forgotten in the region. After his mission was over, Unni prepared to return but fell ill and died in Birka in 936.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 62 (Book I, Chapter 62). Later on Adam mentions an Emund Eriksson as ruling in Sweden at the height of Harald Bluetooth's reign in Denmark (around the 970s).Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 81 (Book II, Chapter 25). From his name he appears to have been a son of Erik Ringsson. Place in the Swedish king list The reign of Erik Ringsson has been tentatively dated in the 940s and 950s.Carl Bernadotte et al. (eds) (1956), p. 93. He is not mentioned in any Norse sagas or king lists. 13th century sagas, such as Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks and Heimskringla, mention a Björn Eriksson as ruling for a long time in the 10th century, being the father of the historical ruler Eric the Victorious (c. 980-995).Nordisk familjebok, 2nd edition http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0322.html Referring to Erik Ringsson as King Eric IV or V is later inventions, counting backwards from Eric XIV (1560–68). He and his brother Charles IX (1604–1611) adopted numerals according to a fictitious history of Sweden. The amount of Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric XIV (at least seven) is unknown, going back into prehistory, and none of them used numerals. It would be speculative to try to affix a mathematically accurate one to this king.

It is the Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis; the Co-Cathedral is the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis. One of the most distinctive cathedrals in the United States, it sits on Cathedral Hill overlooking downtown St. Paul and features a distinctive copper-clad dome. It is dedicated to Paul the Apostle, who is also the namesake of the City of St. Paul. The current building opened in 1915 as the fourth cathedral of the archdiocese to bear this name. On March 25, 2009, it was designated as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican. History The Kittson mansion, demolished to make way for the Cathedral. = Previous Cathedrals = The first church building in what became the Archdiocese was a small log chapel built at the urging of Father Lucien Galtier. He came to the area when the settlement was still known as \\"Pig's Eye\\" (after Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant). The chapel, measuring by , was dedicated on November 1, 1841. Father Augustin Ravoux later enlarged the structure, and when Joseph Crétin was appointed as the bishop of the newly established Diocese of St. Paul in July 1851, the log chapel became the first cathedral. Crétin immediately started to build a larger church to serve the fast-growing population of St. Paul. The second church building had three stories, with a library, kitchen, and school facilities on the first floor; the church itself on the second floor; and offices and living quarters for Crétin and his staff. The second building still proved to be too small for the needs of the diocese, so he started plans for a third cathedral in 1853. Construction of the building, at the corner of St. Peter and Sixth Streets in Downtown St. Paul, started in 1854 and was completed in 1858, having been delayed by the Panic of 1857 and Crétin's death. The third cathedral was built of stone, measured long and wide, but had practically no ornamentation in an effort to cut costs. Thomas Grace was the bishop at the time the cathedral was completed. Landmark Center = Current building = The building of the current cathedral was instigated by Archbishop John Ireland in 1904. The site was formerly occupied by the deteriorating mansion of entrepreneur Norman Kittson. Charles H.F. Smith (the head of the Finance Committee) and Alpheus Beede Stickney, two businessmen in St. Paul, purchased the land and donated it to the archdiocese. At Ireland's direction, the archdiocese commissioned well- known French Beaux-Arts architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, who was also the chief architect of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, and construction began in 1906. He had a budget of $1 million, and he based the cathedral on the designs of French churches of Périgueux Cathedral at Périgueux and Sacre-Coeur basilica in Paris, as well as French Renaissance and Classical themes.Lathrop, Alan K - A French Architect in Minnesota - Emmanuel L. Masqueray 1861-1917 Minnesota Profiles. Minnesota Historical Society. Summer 1980 Masqueray's open design allows visitors unobstructed views of the altar and pulpit. Masqueray died in 1917, having completed only a few designs for the interior, which included three of the Cathedral's major chapels: Saint Peter's, Saint Joseph's and the Blessed Virgin Mary's. In 1987 the Cathedral acquired five bronze bells cast in France. The copper dome was renovated in 2002. In 2013, in conjunction with the restoration of the Cathedral's Æolian- Skinner organ by Quimby Pipe Organs, a new organ case was completed by architect Duncan G Stroik. The hand-carved walnut organ case preserves the view of the Cathedral's rose window. Human-sized carved angels stand on both sides of the organ case and a statue of Saint Cecilia, patron saint of music, stands on top of the central organ case dome, directly below the rose window. The Cathedral is normally open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also a contributing property to the Historic Hill District. On March 25, 2009, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared the Cathedral of Saint Paul to be a National shrine – the first in Minnesota and the only one in North America dedicated to the Apostle Paul. The Cathedral is now also known as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul. The Cathedral was visited by Eugenio Pacelli two years before his election to the Papacy in 1939. Nearby Catholic high schools Saint Thomas Academy, Cretin-Derham Hall, and Hill- Murray School use the Cathedral every year for their graduation services.  Design  Baldachin of the Cathedral of Saint Paul The dome of the cathedral is in diameter and high. Warm-colored paint and gold leaf were added during a major renovation of the dome in the 1950s. The exterior walls of the cathedral are Rockville granite from St. Cloud, Minnesota (from the Clark quarry). The interior walls are American Travertine from Mankato, Minnesota. The interior columns are made of several types of marble. The interior is illuminated by twenty-four stained glass windows featuring angelic choirs. There is also a rose window in the transept designed by Charles Connick. Electric lighting was installed in 1940. Heroic size marble statues of the four evangelists, sculpted by John Angel, are set into the niches of the piers in the four corners of the Church. This placement was not coincidental, according to Msgr. Lawrence Ryan (Historical Sketch of the Cathedral of St. Paul, 1904-1937), for as the piers hold up the church of stone, so the Word recorded by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John sustains that Church not made by human hands. Each statue rises to a height of 11’6” and weighs eight tons. The life of Saint Paul is honored by a bronze baldachin, as well as massive bronze Te Deum and Magnificat grilles. The cathedral also has six chapels dedicated to the patron saints of the European ethnic groups that settled the area around the city: St. Anthony for the Italians, St. John the Baptist for the French Canadians, St. Patrick for the Irish, St. Boniface for the Germans, Saints Cyril and Methodius for the Slavs; and St. Therese of Lisieux for the missionaries. There are also chapels dedicated to the Sacred Heart, to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and to Saint Joseph, her husband, as well as to Saint Peter. alt= See also *List of Catholic cathedrals in the United States *List tallest domes *List of tallest buildings in St. Paul *List of shrines#United States *St. Paul's Cathedral (disambiguation) for other Cathedrals of St. Paul References Other sources *Ernster, Barb. \\"Cathedral is Catechism in Stone and Glass: National Shrine Honors Paul the Apostle\\".

Boucher is regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen of all time. He holds the record for the most Test dismissals by a wicket-keeper, with 532 catches and 555 total dismissals. He has represented Border, Warriors, South Africa, Africa XI, ICC World XI and Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League. He is currently the head coach of the Titans. He had been a regular feature of the South African side since the 1997/1998 tour to Australia, until his retirement from international cricket in July 2012 after a serious eye injury against Somerset. Early life Born in East London, Boucher was educated at Selborne College where he was coached by Richard Pybus. International career =Wicket-keeping role= From the time he replaced Dave Richardson until his retirement, Boucher was South Africa's first-choice wicketkeeper, and is widely regarded as one of, if not the, greatest wicketkeepers South Africa has ever had. He holds the record for the most dismissals (catches and stumpings) in Test cricket. He reached the record originally when he overtook the former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy in the first test of the Bank Alfalah Test Series versus Pakistan in Karachi on 3 October 2007 when he stumped Umar Gul off the bowling of Paul Harris. He then lost the record to Adam Gilchrist before regaining it when he caught Mushfiqur Rahim of Bangladesh in February 2008.South Africa on brink of victory BBC News retrieved 25 February 2008 Boucher is also third on the all- time list in One Day Internationals. =Batting credentials= He once held the record for the highest score by a nightwatchman in Test cricket with 125 for South Africa v Zimbabwe at Harare in November 1999.2nd Test: Zimbabwe v South Africa at Harare, 11–14 Nov 1999 Cricinfo retrieved 25 February 2008 On 12 March 2006 he hit the winning runs for South Africa against Australia in what had been the Greatest One Day International ever played.AUS vs SA, 12/3/2006 BBC News retrieved 25 February 2008 Later in 2006, on 20 September, he made his maiden ODI century, hitting an unbeaten 147 against Zimbabwe from a mere 68 balls. His hundred came up off just 44 balls, the second-fastest ODI century ever by a South African after AB de Villiers. Boucher did benefit, however, from some very poor Zimbabwean fielding, being dropped no fewer than six times during his innings.Boucher blitz blows Zimbabwe away Cricinfo retrieved 25 February 2008 He has played over one hundred consecutive ODIs for his country and is one of only eleven players, including Hansie Cronjé and Shaun Pollock, to achieve this.Most consecutive ODIs. Cricinfo retrieved 25 February 2008 In February 2007 he and Jacques Kallis combined to hit Mohammad Asif for 28 runs off an over in an ODI at SuperSport Park in Centurion. It broke the South African record for most runs off an over which was previously held by both Shaun Pollock and Graeme Smith with 27. However, this was later broken by Herschelle Gibbs with 36 runs off one over, the most possible without no-balls or wides.Most runs off one over retrieved 25 February 2008 =Vice captaincy= In the period while the team was under Shaun Pollock's leadership, Boucher was the regular vice-captain of the team and lead the team in tests four times. These matches include a victory over Australia, an achievement which Pollock could not manage. =Breaking records= Boucher started his 2007 Cricket World Cup campaign in good form with a 21-ball half century, the then fastest in World Cup history (before being beaten by Brendon McCullum's 20-ball effort six days later) – scoring 75 not out against the Netherlands as South Africa scored 353 for 4 wickets in a rain-shortened World Cup match. However, this was overshadowed by Herschelle Gibbs's six sixes in an over, the 3rd time ever in world cricket and first time in a One Day International match, and thus in the World Cup.SA vs NET, World Cup 2007 Cricinfo retrieved 25 February 2008 He became the first wicketkeeper in the history of test cricket to reach the milestone of 400 dismissals when he caught Danish Kaneria off the bowling of Makhaya Ntini on 10 October 2007 in the second test of the Bank Alfalah Test Series against Pakistan at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.Pakistan v South Africa at Lahore, 08-12 Oct 2007 Cricinfo retrieved 25 February 2008 Mark Boucher training at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 2009 Despite being South Africa's consistent wicket-keeper for a long time, age meant that batsman AB de Villiers was given a chance with the gloves and he impressed. However de Villiers is one of the team's best outfielders and therefore Boucher continued to feature in the team. He participated in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and the South African coach Corrie van Zyl said that both Boucher and Herschelle Gibbs have the chance to get back in the team. He stated that Boucher will get his chance in the team provided that he performs in the domestic ODI tournament and that both of them had a good chance in playing for the 2011 Cricket World Cup He was however still selected for the Test series against Pakistan and continues to be South Africa's number one test wicket-keeper Also during that time Boucher recovered from his six-week shoulder injury and stated that he is desperate for a return to international cricket. He stated that his main aim was to participate in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. =Eye injury and subsequent retirement= Boucher is surrounded by the South African team immediately after suffering his eye injury against Somerset in 2012.Boucher suffered a serious eye injury on 9 July 2012, after being struck on his left eye by a bail. He was not wearing a protective helmet or glasses when he was struck by the bail after leg-spinner Imran Tahir bowled Somerset's Gemaal Hussain. Following surgery to the eyeball, Boucher was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Due to the severity of the injury, Boucher—who had planned to retire at the end of the tour—retired from International Cricket on 10 July.South Africa's Mark Boucher ruled out of England Test series BBC News retrieved 10 July 2012 There was no damage to the retina, so it was felt that there was a chance for Boucher to recover some vision in the damaged eye. After undergoing two operations on his injured eye, surgeons announced that they were \\"cautiously optimistic\\". Coaching In December 2019, Boucher was appointed as head coach of the South Africa national cricket team. Honours Tributes included comments from Shaun Pollock and Kevin Pietersen. Pollock congratulated him on a great career, while Pietersen called for more support from fans and those involved in sports, saying \\"Let’s keep it going! Bouch is a fighter!\\". In May 2017, he was named Coach of the Year at Cricket South Africa's annual awards. * South Africa Player of the Year 1998 * South Africa Player of the Year 2000 * South Africa Player of the Year 2006 * Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2009 Achievements * He also holds the record for the most dismissals as wicketkeeper in all forms of international cricket (999). * Holds the record for the most catches taken by a wicketkeeper in all forms of international cricket (952). * Holds the record for playing the most T20 innings without a career duck (76). * Most byes conceded by a wicketkeeper in a T20I innings (15). * He along with Justin Kemp set the record for the highest 6th wicket stand in ICC Champions Trophy history (131).

The novel describes how three women are forced to come to terms with their identity, both as women and as sexual beings, in a small, conservative, gossipy New England town, with recurring themes of hypocrisy, social inequities and class privilege in a tale that includes incest, abortion, adultery, lust and murder. It sold 60,000 copies within the first ten days of its release and remained on The New York Times best seller list for 59 weeks. The novel spawned a franchise that would run through four decades. 20th Century-Fox adapted it as a movie in 1957, and Metalious wrote a follow-up novel that was published in 1959, titled Return to Peyton Place, which was filmed in 1961 using the same title. The original 1956 novel was adapted again in 1964, in what became a wildly successful prime time television series for 20th Century Fox Television that ran until 1969, and the term \\"Peyton Place\\" – an allusion to any small town or group that holds scandalous secrets – entered into the American lexicon. A daytime soap opera titled Return to Peyton Place ran from 1972 to 1974, and the franchise was rounded out with two made-for-television movies: Murder in Peyton Place and Peyton Place: The Next Generation. Setting The story starts in 1937 and continues through the years following World War II. While never mentioned explicitly by name, the novel does make several references that suggest Peyton Place is located within the state of New Hampshire: Vermont can be seen from across the Connecticut River; Lake Winnipesaukee is a short drive from the town; a nearby New England town is called White River a character is spoken of as attending the New Hampton School for Boys; and several mentions are made of a lake called Silver Lake, of which there are four located in New England, three in the state of New Hampshire, in the cities of Harrisville, Hollis and Madison. The fictional Peyton Place also appears to be a composite of several real New Hampshire towns: Metalious' hometown of Gilmanton, as well as Gilford, Laconia, Manchester and Plymouth, where at least some of the work was written at the Plymouth Inn on Main Street (the inn has been torn down). Grace Metalious and her husband George first considered Potter Place (the name of a real community near Andover, New Hampshire). Realizing their town should have a fictional name, they looked through an atlas and found Payton (the name of a real town in Texas). They combined that with Place and changed the \\"a\\" to an \\"e\\". Thus, Peyton Place was created, prompting her comment, \\"Wonderful—that's it, George. Peyton Place. Peyton Place, New Hampshire. Peyton Place, New England. Peyton Place, USA. Truly a composite of all small towns where ugliness rears its head, and where the people try to hide all the skeletons in their closets.\\"Metalious, George and O'Shea, June. The Girl from Peyton Place, Dell, 1965. Characters and story The main plot follows the lives of three women: lonely and repressed Constance MacKenzie, her illegitimate daughter Allison, and her employee Selena Cross, a girl from across the tracks or \\"from the shacks.\\" Several characters and events were drawn from events in nearby towns and people that Metalious actually knew. Selena Cross was based on Barbara Roberts, a 16-year-old girl from the village of Gilmanton Ironworks, who murdered her father Sylvester after years of sexual abuse and buried his body under a sheep pen. In the novel, Selena kills her stepfather because incest was considered too taboo for readers at the time. Metalious' editor Kitty Messner made the change, much to the author's dismay and disapproval.Farrell, Joelle. \\"'Pandora in blue jeans' lives on\\", Concord Monitor, March 26, 2006. Constance leaves Peyton Place for New York City at a young age and meets a man in the publishing business named Allison MacKenzie, who already is married with children. Constance becomes pregnant with MacKenzie's child. MacKenzie dies a few years after his daughter, also named Allison, is born. Constance and her daughter adopt Allison's last name before returning to Peyton Place as a \\"widow\\" and child, and Constance alters her daughter's birth date to make her appear legitimate. In Peyton Place, Nellie marries Lucas Cross shortly after their daughter Selena's birth, although Selena is not Lucas's child. Paul, Lucas's son and Selena's stepbrother, left Peyton Place after accusing Lucas of stealing his money. Nellie and Lucas later had a child together: Joey, who lives with the couple and Selena in \\"the shacks,\\" a poor section of town. When Selena turned 14 years old, Lucas began to abuse her, impregnating her and leaving the local doctor in a troublesome situation in which he decided to perform an abortion. The doctor made Lucas leave town, and after she discovered this, Nellie committed suicide by hanging. Leslie Harrington, the richest man in town, was shattered when he lost his only son, Rodney, in a car accident. Novelist Barbara Delinsky, author of the fictional Looking for Peyton Place (2006), summarized the storyline of Peyton Place on her website: > Peyton Place opens in 1937.

At 6 ft 5in, Caddick was a successful bowler for England for a decade, taking 13 five-wicket hauls in Test matches. He spent his entire English domestic first-class cricket career at Somerset County Cricket Club, and then played one Minor Counties match for Wiltshire in 2009. Early life Caddick was born in Christchurch, New Zealand to English parents, and educated at Papanui High School. As a youngster, he modelled his bowling action on that of Richard Hadlee. He appeared three times for New Zealand Young Cricketers, all of his appearances coming in February 1988. His performances were unremarkable, the highlight being an unbeaten 20 with the bat and bowling figures of 1/16 off three overs in the first One Day International (ODI) against the touring India Under 19 team. In spite of his modest figures in the two matches against the Indians, he retained his place for the first match of the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup. However, after struggling with 0/39 he lost his place, and did not appear for New Zealand again. Opportunity in England Frustration at what he saw as a lack of opportunities to be selected for the New Zealand Test side drove him to try his luck in England, something New Zealand captain Ken Rutherford would later rue, commenting that \\"he slipped through the net and given our lack of depth we can ill afford to lose players like him\\". He played a handful of games for Middlesex Second XI in late 1988 and early 1989, taking 17 wickets in four matches for them at 26.71. On his Somerset Second XI debut in June 1989, Caddick took 8/46 in Surrey Second XI's first innings. He was restricted to playing in the Second XI Championship for the 1990 and 1991 seasons, as Jimmy Cook was the club's overseas player and Caddick had yet to serve his four years to qualify as an English player. In spite of this, he made his first-class debut for Somerset against the West Indians in May 1991, but his only further match of the season was against the touring Sri Lankans in the August. Domestic career His County Championship debut and breakthrough came in the 1992 season, with Caddick immediately amongst the wickets, taking 4/96 against Gloucestershire. Later in the season, he took his maiden 10 wicket haul against Kent, and finished the season with a respectable 71 wickets at 27.01. He impressed the right people and was rewarded with his county cap, and a place in the England A squad touring Australia. He shone on the tour, finishing with a first-class bowling average of 28.60, by far the best on the England team. A strong start to the following season, including a career best 9/32 in the second innings of a match against Lancashire, saw him called up to the Test and one-day squads for the 1993 Ashes series. =Period of uncertainty= Injuries plagued Caddick through the 1994 and 1995 seasons, limiting his appearances for Somerset and keeping him out of the England squad altogether. He was initially hampered with a shoulder injury, and then with recurring shin issues that for a time threatened to end his career completely. When he did play, he showed his class, taking 6/70 against Nottinghamshire, and 6/51 against Durham in the space of a few weeks. In his final match of the 1995 season, he hit his highest total with the bat, 92 against Worcestershire. The start of the 1996 season saw him back to full fitness and in irresistible form. He claimed a five-fer in each innings against Warwickshire to take his first of three 10 wicket hauls for the season, the next coming only two matches later against Worcestershire. These figures, along with his general good form saw him recalled to the England team for the second Test against Pakistan. He took three wickets in each innings to give him match figures of 6/165, and could consider himself unlucky to be dropped immediately after. He finished off his season with 10 wickets against Sussex, once again claiming a five-fer in each innings. =Later county career= In 2007 Caddick, at the age of thirty-eight, finished the season as the leading English wicket-taker with 75 wickets at 23.10 as Somerset gained promotion from Division Two of the County Championship. That Christmas, Caddick underwent surgery on his back to correct pain he had felt during the final games of the season, and he rejoined training with Somerset in February 2008. Somerset awarded Caddick benefit seasons in 1999 and in 2009. Also, in June 2009, he played one match for Wiltshire against Wales Minor Counties. In early August 2009, Caddick announced that he would be retiring from first-class cricket at the end of the season. International career =Debut years= Caddick warming up prior to a one-day matchMaking his debut in the first ODI of the 1993 Texaco Trophy series at Old Trafford, after an average display with the ball in which he took 1/50, Caddick arrived at the crease with 11 runs required to win. Four runs were added to the score prior to the final over, leaving Caddick and Richard Illingworth needing to score seven runs off the last over to secure the match for England. A leg bye reduced the target, but they still needed six from the last two balls. Facing the penultimate ball, Caddick stroked the ball to long leg and launched himself off for the single, turned and sprinted back for the second, only to find that Illingworth had remained in his crease. Illingworth was run out, and England lost by four runs. Caddick had no such excitement in the second ODI, as he was not required to bat, and failed to take any wickets on a batting track at Edgbaston. With the series already lost, Caddick found more joy in the third ODI, taking three wickets and helping to restrict the Australians to 230; a total England must have felt they could chase down. A batting collapse ensured that this would not be the case, and Australia took the series 3–0. He found it difficult to penetrate the Australians batting line up through the Test series and, in a tough series for England, he flourished only through one session at Trent Bridge. He was eventually dropped for the fifth and sixth Ashes Tests. Returning to Somerset, he took three five-fers in the final two months of the season. Caddick was not to be out of the England side for long, as he was named in the squad to tour the West Indies. He shone in the third Test at Queen's Park Oval, where he took 6/65 in the West Indies second innings, although this was overshadowed when England were bowled out for just 46 in their second innings, with Curtly Ambrose taking 11 wickets in the match. He also managed 5/63 in the second innings of the fourth Test at Kensington Oval, although he was yet again overshadowed, this time by Alec Stewart scoring centuries in both England innings' and Angus Fraser's 8/75 in the first innings. Caddick did however finish the series as England's leading Test wicket taker, with 18 wickets to his name. =Second international spell= In the winter of 1996–97, Caddick found himself rather more permanently back in the England set-up, touring Zimbabwe and New Zealand. Caddick's involvement in Zimbabwe was limited to two warm up matches, with his performances described by one newspaper as akin to \\"a camel loping into one of the hot dry harmattans that blow off the Kalahari\\". He thus travelled to his native New Zealand with a point to prove. He again failed to shine during the warm up matches, and was left out again for the first Test. His chance to prove his critics wrong came in the second Test, and he seemed to take it with a menacing streak to his game, snatching four wickets in the first innings and a further two in the second. He retained his place for the third Test and the majority of the One Day International series, and along with Darren Gough was one of the stand out bowlers of the tour. Playing against the West Indies in 2000, Caddick became one of only four bowlers ever to take four wickets in a single six-ball over, as England beat the West Indies in a series for the first time since 1969.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/18/when-andy-caddick-took- four-test-wickets-for-england-in-a-single-over-the-spin-cricket Post- retirement life Caddick is a qualified pilot, and works in aviation sales for a Devonshire company.https://www.rotortechuk.com/news/andy- caddick/https://www.jamesedition.com/stories/jets/cricket-star-andy-caddick-s- agusta-on-james-interview- inside-932/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/18/when-andy-caddick- took-four-test-wickets-for-england-in-a-single-over-the-spin-cricket Honours *Wisden Cricketers of the Year: 2001 References External links *Official Website * Category:England Test cricketers Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup Category:Somerset cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:New Zealand people of English descent Category:Wiltshire cricketers Category:New Zealand emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Cricketers from Christchurch Category:People educated at Papanui High School ","title":"Andrew Caddick"},{"id":"896399","text":"The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), or grey fox, is an omnivorous mammal of the family Canidae, widespread throughout North America and Central America. This species and its only congener, the diminutive island fox (Urocyon littoralis) of the California Channel Islands, are the only living members of the genus Urocyon, which is considered to be the most basal of the living canids. Though it was once the most common fox in the eastern United States, and still is found there, human advancement and deforestation allowed the red fox to become more dominant. The Pacific States still have the gray fox as a dominant. It is the only American canid that can climb trees. Its specific epithet cinereoargenteus means \\"ashen silver\\". Description The gray fox is mainly distinguished from most other canids by its grizzled upper parts, black stripe down its tail and strong neck, while the skull can be easily distinguished from all other North American canids by its widely separated temporal ridges that form a U-shape. There is little sexual dimorphism, save for the females being slightly smaller than males. The gray fox ranges from in total length. The tail measures of that length and its hind feet measure . The gray fox typically weighs , though exceptionally can weigh as much as .Boitani, Luigi (1984) Simon & Schuster's Guide to Mammals. Simon & Schuster/Touchstone Books, Common Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) . Nsrl.ttu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-01-26. It is readily differentiated from the red fox by the obvious lack of \\"black stockings\\" that stand out on the latter, a stripe of black hair that runs along the middle of its tail, and individual guard hairs being banded with white, gray, and black. The gray fox displays white on the ears, throat, chest, belly and hind legs. In contrast to all Vulpes and related (Arctic and fennec) foxes, the gray fox has oval (instead of slit-like) pupils. The dental formula of the U. cinereoargenteus is = 42. Origin and genetics Gray fox kit at the Palo Alto Baylands in California The gray fox appeared in North America during the mid-Pliocene (Hemphillian land animal age) epoch ago (AEO) with the first fossil evidence found at the lower 111 Ranch site, Graham County, Arizona with contemporary mammals like the giant sloth, the elephant-like Cuvieronius, the large-headed llama, and the early small horses of Nannippus and Equus. Genetic analyses of the fox- like canids confirmed that the gray fox is a distinct genus from the red foxes (Vulpes spp.). Genetically, the gray fox often clusters with two other ancient lineages, the east Asian raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and the African bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis). The chromosome number is 66 (diploid) with a fundamental number of 70. The autosomes include 31 pairs of sub-graded subacrocentrics, but one only pair of metacentrics. Faunal remains at two northern California cave sites confirm the presence of the gray fox during the late Pleistocene. Genetic analysis has shown that the gray fox migrated into the northeastern United States post-Pleistocene in association with the Medieval Climate Anomaly warming trend. Recent mitochondrial genetic studies suggests divergence of North American eastern and western gray foxes in the Irvingtonian mid-Pleistocene into separate sister taxa. The gray fox's dwarf relative, the island fox, is likely descended from mainland gray foxes. These foxes apparently were transported by humans to the islands and from island to island, and are descended from a minimum of 3–4 matrilineal founders. The genus Urocyon is considered to be the most basal of the living canids. Distribution and habitat The species occurs throughout most rocky, wooded, brushy regions of the southern half of North America from southern Canada (Manitoba through southeastern Quebec) to the northern part of South America (Venezuela and Colombia), excluding the mountains of northwestern United States. It is the only canid whose natural range spans both North and South America. In some areas, high population densities exist near brush- covered bluffs. Behavior A yawning gray fox, northern Florida The gray fox's ability to climb trees is shared only with the Asian raccoon dog and the New Guinea Wild Singing Dog Wikipedia Page among canids. Its strong, hooked claws allow it to scramble up trees to escape many predators, such as the domestic dog or the coyote, or to reach tree-bound or arboreal food sources. It can climb branchless, vertical trunks to heights of 18 meters and jump from branch to branch.Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio; Hoffman, Michael; and MacDonald David W. (2004) Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals, and Dogs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK: IUCN. p. 95 It descends primarily by jumping from branch to branch, or by descending slowly backwards like a domestic cat. The gray fox is primarily nocturnal or crepuscular and makes its den in hollow trees, stumps or appropriated burrows during the day. Such gray fox tree dens may be located 30 ft above the ground. Prior to European colonization of North America, the red fox was found primarily in boreal forest and the gray fox in deciduous forest.  Reproduction  Gray fox, showing black tail stripe, Sierra Nevada The gray fox is assumed monogamous. The breeding season of the gray fox varies geographically; in Michigan, the gray fox mates in early March, in Alabama, breeding peaks occur in February. The gestation period lasts approximately 53 days. Litter size ranges from 1 to 7, with a mean of 3.8 young per female. The sexual maturity of females is around 10 months of age. Kits begin to hunt with their parents at the age of 3 months. By the time that they are four months old, the kits will have developed their permanent dentition and can now easily forage on their own. The family group remains together until the autumn, when the young males reach sexual maturity, then they disperse. Out of a study of nine juvenile gray foxes, only the males dispersed up to . The juvenile females stayed within proximity of the den within and always returned.Sheldon, 1953 On the other hand, adult gray foxes showed no signs of dispersion for either gender.Follmann, 1973 The annual reproductive cycle of males has been described through epididymal smears and become fertile earlier and remain fertile longer than the fertility of females. Dens are used at any time during the year but mostly during whelping season. Dens are built in brushy or wooded regions and are less obvious than the dens of the red fox. Logs, trees, rocks, burrows, or abandoned dwellings serve as suitable den sites.  Diet  The gray fox is an omnivorous, solitary hunter. It frequently preys on the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) in the eastern U.S., though it will readily catch voles, shrews, and birds. In California, the gray fox primarily eats rodents, followed by lagomorphs, e.g. jackrabbit, brush rabbit, etc. In some parts of the Western United States (such as in the Zion National Park in Utah), the gray fox is primarily insectivorous and herbivorous. Fruit is an important component of the diet of the gray fox and they seek whatever fruits are readily available, generally eating more vegetable matter than does the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).

A leg break googly bowler, at his peak he was described as being one of the best three wrist-spinners in the world. In an international career that spanned from 1990 until 2003, he claimed 185 wickets in Test cricket and 161 in One Day Internationals. He was at his most prolific internationally between 1995 and 1998, but his most successful years were as a domestic player for Sussex in the early 2000s. Mushtaq was part of the Pakistan team which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, and five years later, he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. During his time with Sussex, he was the leading wicket-taker in the County Championship for five successive seasons, and helped the county win the competition in 2003, 2006 and 2007. He is the only bowlers in the world to take man of the match in SENA countries Playing career =Early career= Mushtaq Ahmed made his first- class cricket debut in January 1987, at the age of 16. Playing for Multan, he claimed four wickets in the second innings of the match against Sukkur. He claimed his maiden recorded five-wicket haul in the format the following season, playing for the Punjab Chief Minister's XI against the touring England cricket team. Shortly thereafter, he competed in the 1988 Under-19 World Cup, where he was the joint leading wicket-taker, claiming 19 wickets at an average of 16.21. Pakistan reached the final of the tournament, in which they lost to Australia by five wickets. Early the following season, Mushtaq took the first ten-wicket haul of his career, collecting six wickets in the first innings and eight in the second innings of a match against Peshawar. He continued to impress that season, and took 52 wickets at an average of 22.84. He continued to appear for Pakistan Under-19s, and took 26 wickets in their series against India under-19s, more than double any other Pakistani player. His strong performances resulted in a call-up to the Pakistan national cricket team in March 1989. =International bowler= He made his full international debut on 23 March 1989, playing a One Day International (ODI) against Sri Lanka. He took two wickets for 33 runs in the match, which Pakistan won by 30 runs. He retained his place in the Pakistan side for the subsequent tri-series with India and the West Indies, and made his Test cricket debut in January 1990 against Australia at the Adelaide Oval. His only wicket of the match was that of Mark Taylor. A year later, took fourteen wickets in a match against Peshawar, collecting five in the first innings, followed by nine in the second, finishing the match with figures of 14 for 130. In 1992, Mushtaq was part of the Pakistan team which won the Cricket World Cup. He was joint-second amongst bowlers by wickets taken, having claimed 16 during the tournament, trailing only his compatriot Wasim Akram. He struggled to make a significant impact in Test cricket for a number of years after his debut: between 1990 and 1994, he only claimed ten or more wickets in a Test series on one occasion, against England in 1992. However, between November 1995 and March 1998, he took at least ten wickets in every Test series, and claimed ten five-wicket hauls. The first occasion on which he claimed five wickets in an innings in Test cricket was the second Test against Australia in November 1995. He repeated the feat in the third Test of that series, and then in the only Test of the subsequent series against New Zealand, in which he recorded his best figures in a Test match, seven for 56. His only five-wicket haul in ODI cricket occurred in the fifth ODI of the \\"Sahara 'Friendship' Cup\\", a series played between India and Pakistan in Toronto, Canada. He took five wickets for 36 runs to help Pakistan win the match by 52 runs, and thus clinch the series 3–2. During his most prolific years of Test cricket, he played his first spell of county cricket, appearing for Somerset between 1993 and 1998. In his book Somerset County Cricket Club (100 Greats), Eddie Lawrence describes Mushtaq as \\"one of Somerset's best-ever \\"overseas\\" signings.\\" He played 62 first-class matches for the county, and claimed 289 wickets at an average of 26.32. In 1997, he was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year, in which he was described as being a member of \\"a glittering triumvirate of wrist- spinners who adorn the modern game.\\" In the late 1990s, Mushtaq was one of a number of Pakistan cricketers who were suspected of match-fixing. Saleem Pervez alleged that he had given Mushtaq, along with Salim Malik, £100,000 to intentionally lose a match against Australia in September 1994. After an inquiry, Mushtaq was fined £3,500, and banned from captaining Pakistan. The judge presiding over the inquiry stated that: \\"There are sufficient grounds to cast strong doubt on Mushtaq Ahmed.\\" =Later career= After losing his place in the Pakistan national cricket team, Mushtaq played one season of county cricket for Surrey in 2002, having appeared in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition for Northop Hall the previous year. He failed to impress for Surrey, claiming eight wickets at an average of 38.12. The following season, he joined Sussex, where he became the leading county wicket taker for five seasons in a row, playing a major role in Sussex's first ever County Championship title. His form for the county prompted a recall to international duty, but it was short-lived: he played two Tests and one ODI before being dropped for the final time. He helped Sussex to win the County Championship twice more before persistent knee injuries forced him to retire at the end of the 2008 season. In 85 matches with Sussex, Mushtaq claimed 478 wickets at an average of 25.34.  Coaching career  In late 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board appointed Mushtaq as spin-bowling coach to the England cricket team until 2014 when lost his job in Peter Moores reshuffle. He joins batting coach Graham Gooch and Richard Halsall, the fielding coach in not retaining their roles. His major success as bowling was to install Graeme Swann as lead spin bowler for England cricket team He was bowling coach of Surrey County Cricket Club for brief period of time in 2012. Mushtaq joins Surrey for a month He was also on the verge of joining the Delhi Daredevils as a bowling coach for the 2013 IPL season. Mushtaq Ahmed set to join Delhi Daredevils In 2014, Mushataq was named as Pakistan cricket team's bowling consultant under new coach Waqar Younis and his contract ended in May 2016. Ahmed named Pakistan bowling consultant Ahmed loses England role In April 2016, Mushtaq was named as head coach of Pakistan's National Cricket Academy. PCB appoint Mushtaq Ahmed as National Cricket Academy's head coach In November 2018 Ahmed was appointed as the assistant coach and spin consultant of West Indies national cricket team ahead of the tour of Bangladesh. In April 2019 Mushtaq was honoured with the Outstanding Achievement in Sport award at The Asian Awards. On 9 June 2020, the PCB appointed Mushtaq Ahmed as their spin-bowling coach for Pakistan's tour to England.

Stewart is a well-known supporter of Surrey County Cricket Club and Chelsea F.C. When shirt numbers were introduced for One Day International cricket, Stewart chose the number 4 shirt in honour of his favourite Chelsea player when growing up, John Hollins, and kept that shirt number throughout his career.Profile at Arundel Promotions International career Stewart made his England debut in the first Test of the 1989/90 tour of the West Indies, along with Nasser Hussain, who would eventually replace him as England captain. At the start of his career, Stewart was a specialist opening batsman for England, with wicketkeeping duties being retained by Jack Russell, who was generally recognised as the superior gloveman and who batted down the order. However, Russell, the inferior batsman, would often be dropped to improve the balance of the side (i.e. to accommodate an extra bowler or batsman), in which case Stewart would don the gloves. After enduring years of selection and deselection, Russell retired from international cricket in 1998, leaving Stewart unrivalled as England's keeper-batsman until his own retirement in 2003. Alec Stewart's career performance graph. =Prominence= His highest Test score, 190, was against Pakistan in the drawn first Edgbaston Test on 4 June 1992; it was his fourth century in five Tests. In 1994 at the Kensington Oval he became only the seventh Englishman to score centuries in both innings of a Test match, scoring 118 and 143 as the West Indies were beaten at their Bridgetown \\"fortress\\" for the first time since 1935.Wisden: West Indies v England, 1993–94 Stewart's batting average (39.54) is the lowest of any player to have scored 8000 or more runs in Test cricket: he is the only player to have scored over 8000 runs despite an average of under 40.Cricinfo statsguru: batsmen who scored 8000 Test runs or more However, when played as a specialist batsman in Test cricket, Stewart averaged 46.90 in 51 games with 9 centuries. Since World War II, only Len Hutton, Geoff Boycott, Dennis Amiss and Alastair Cook have bettered Stewart's average of 46 as a specialist opening batsman for England.Cricinfo statsguru: openers by batting average since 1945 As wicketkeeper-batsman he averaged 34.92 from 82 tests, higher than many of his contemporaries and many of the current batch of international wicketkeepers. He was unlucky enough to be on the losing side in a record 54 Test Matches. Stewart holds the record for scoring most test runs without a career double century in test history (8463) =Captaincy= Stewart was groomed for the England captaincy under Graham Gooch, deputising for him in four tests in India and Sri Lanka in 1993, but when Gooch retired from the captaincy later that year Mike Atherton was chosen to succeed him. Stewart was asked to captain England in 1998 when Mike Atherton resigned. Despite being the age of 35 at the time, Stewart's level of fitness was impeccable, especially bearing in mind that most players do not continue beyond 37. As it was Stewart went on to play for England beyond his 40th birthday – but as events were to transpire – his captaincy of England barely lasted 12 months. In his first series as captain, against South Africa, Stewart scored an outstanding 164 in the third Test at Old Trafford to salvage a draw, a result which eventually enabled England to overturn a 1–0 deficit to win the series 2–1. Nonetheless, failures against Australia and in the 1999 Cricket World Cup saw him sacked from the captaincy to be replaced by Hussain. During his captaincy, he had the unusual distinction of simultaneously captaining the side, opening the batting and keeping wicket. He continued to deputise occasionally as captain of England's one-day side, and became the second international captain to concede a match in 2001, after a pitch invasion during a One Day International against Pakistan rendered the continuation of play impossible.Stewart concedes defeat after another pitch invasion He continued as an England player for five more seasons, and became only the fourth player to score a century in his 100th Test, scoring 105 against the West Indies at Old Trafford in 2000. Stewart also set a record for playing the most number of ODI matches(28) as a captain who has kept wicket and opened the batting. After cricket In 2004, Stewart became a founding director of Arundel Promotions with specific responsibility for player management and representation. Cricket playing clients include Paul Collingwood, Ian Bell, Ashley Giles and Matt Prior. In 2009, Stewart rejoined Surrey as a part-time consultant to the coaching staff specialising in batting, wicket keeping and mentoring.

Early life The son of PeterSlater and Apter (2005), p. ix. and Carole, Slater was born in the New South Wales rural city Wagga Wagga after his parents and two elder siblings (Julian and Tracey) had emigrated from the north-eastern coast of England in 1966. They originally migrated to Launceston, Australia by boat, after deciding against moving to Canada. In Launceston, Slater's father taught agriculture and science at high school, as he had done since graduating from college. After three years in Launceston, the Slaters moved to Junee then Wagga Wagga, and Peter became a lecturer in agriculture at what is now known as the Charles Sturt University.Slater and Apter (2005), p. 9–10. Slater lived in Junee for some of his life Wagga Wagga for his entire childhood, eventually leaving with only fond memories. He later wrote: \\"Wagga Wagga was a great place to grow up, for many reasons. It was a good size – it had a population of around 50,000 when we moved there – and it was in the country, with a great Australian climate. My family was always involved in sport, so from an early age it just seemed natural for me to play any game that was on offer.\\"Slater and Apter (2005), p. 10. When still in primary school at junee and aged 11, Slater was selected in the New South Wales Primary School Sports Association cricket and hockey teams, something he described as \\"a very big thing\\" and \\"totally unexpected\\". A left-inner (an attacking player who helps out defensively), he also made the state hockey team at Under–12 level in 1981, before going on to later be selected in the Under–13, −15 and −17 teams.Slater and Apter (2005), p. 18. Slater's mother unexpectedly left the family in 1983, when Michael was just 12 years old. He later wrote about the tough personal times that followed. After his mother left for good, Slater's education standards slipped, with sport becoming the \\"only thing [he] could focus on properly\\". School bullying accentuated his academic difficulties in Years 9 and 10, and he once ran home after it was suggested among fellow pupils that some bullies \\"were planning to get [him] after school\\".Slater and Apter (2005), p. 22–23. As cricket and hockey began to overlap in his early teenage years, Slater slowly turned the majority of his sporting appetite towards cricket. He joined an inner-western Sydney Under–16 side over the Christmas holidays. Despite not being fond of Sydney, Slater knew that he would have to move to the metropolis if he wanted to further develop his cricketing career. After topping the batting averages in the Under–17s in the following season, Slater was subsequently chosen as captain for the New South Wales Under—16 team. The carnival was not a personal success for the captain; however, he recalls that his team performed \\"well\\".Slater and Apter (2005), p. 26–29. An accident at school when he was seventeen saw Slater hurt his Achilles tendon. He played a couple of hockey games following the accident, but had to limp off the field and have consequent surgery in the lead-up to the Under–17 national cricket carnival. Soon after, Slater was informed that, because of his injury, his \\"dream of playing cricket for Australia was over\\".Slater and Apter (2005), p. 30. After an operation, though, he surprisingly returned to cricket and was selected in the Under–19 state team for the national championships in Brisbane. After an injury to the captain, Slater once again captained his state, although he and his team under-performed.Slater and Apter (2005), p. 31. He returned as vice- captain the following year for the Under–19 carnival in Canberra, and scored a century in the opening match. In a victorious final against Victoria, Slater scored another century, becoming one of the leading run-scorers in the series.Slater and Apter (2005), p. 34–35. Cricket career A specialist right-handed batsman as well as a very occasional bowler, Slater represented the New South Wales Blues in Australian domestic cricket and played English county cricket with Derbyshire. His Australian club was the University of NSW Cricket Club playing first grade scoring 3873 runs in 77 innings with a high score of 213*. Generally known for his swashbuckling style of play and front- foot pulls, Slater went on to open the batting with success in Test cricket, scoring 5,312 runs and 14 centuries at an average of 42; however he was less successful in his One Day International career, averaging a lowly 24.07. Throughout his career, Slater was infamous for his susceptibility to the \\"nervous nineties\\": he was dismissed in the nineties 9 out of the 23 times.Zaltzman, Andy. \\"The irony of being dismissed in the 90s in the '90s.\\" Cricinfo, 30 April 2013. He was a product of the AIS Australian Cricket Academy (1989) before appearing for New South Wales in the 1991/92 Sheffield Shield season. He made quick progress to the Australian Test team, and was selected for the Ashes tour of England in 1993, when he was just 23 years of age, narrowly beating Queenslander Matthew Hayden to the opening berth alongside Mark Taylor, who also grew up in Wagga Wagga. In his debut match, he scored a half-century, before compiling his maiden century in the following Test at Lord's. He continued his good form into the subsequent home series against New Zealand in 1993–94, netting 305 runs at an average of 76.25. In the 1994–95 return Ashes series in Australia, the right-hander was the leading run-scorer in the series with 623. The following season saw Slater notch his first double-century, against Sri Lanka at the WACA in Perth. Slater's matchwinning 123 against England at Sydney in the 1998–99 Ashes series comprised 66.84 per cent of his team's entire total. This remains the greatest proportion since Charles Bannerman made 165 not out in the very first test innings of all, which was 67.34 per cent of his team's total.[Richard Bright]. \\"England frustrated by Slater's good luck.\\" Cricinfo, 5 January 1999.

He later switched from Western Australia to New South Wales where he currently lives. Katich made his Test debut in the fourth Test of the 2001 Ashes tour of England. He failed to capitalize making only 15 and was not out 0. In only his second match he bowled for the first time in Test cricket, and in the second innings took 6/65 against Zimbabwe in Sydney. Following Steve Waugh's retirement in 2004, Katich established himself in the Australian team. His best Test batting performance came against India at Sydney in January 2004, when his 125 and unbeaten 77 saved Australia the Test, series, and a decade long unbeaten record at home. Despite this, he was dropped in favour of Andrew Symonds for Australia's next Test, in Sri Lanka, when Symonds was dropped after the first two Tests, Katich was picked for the third Test and made a patient 86. He regained his place and enjoyed a good Test series in India in October 2004, where he made good scores of 81 and 99. His good form continued with 118 against New Zealand in March 2005. However, he had a poor Ashes tour of England later that year batting at number 6, and after scoring only two runs in the following two Tests (against the ICC World XI and the West Indies), he was dropped from the Test side. Katich was fined for showing dissent during the fourth Test to umpire Aleem Dar along with captain Ricky Ponting.http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/skipper-and-katich-pay-hefty-price- for-outbursts/2005/08/29/1125302507583.html Since the commencement of the 2005–06 season, Katich attempted to cement his place in the Australian one day cricket side, having lost his Test place. Australia persisted with him throughout the VB Series and in South Africa, as Katich scored runs fairly consistently. However, he struggled in the DLF Cup in September 2006; the next month he lost his place at the top of the order to Shane Watson, who impressed Ponting with some attacking displays against the West Indies and an Indian state team. Katich was not picked in the 15 man squad to play in the World Cup in the West Indies. Katich played a total of 45 One day Internationals. Selected for the 2008 Australian team's tour of India he found himself opening the batting with the injury to Phil Jaques. He retained his spot for the home series against New Zealand. In the first Test, at the Gabba, Brisbane, he made 10 in the first innings (in which Australia was all out for 214 on a tough batting deck). However, in the second innings, Katich carried his bat through the innings; the first cricketer to do so at Test level since Mark Taylor in the late 1990s. He made 131 not out, 48.88% of Australia's total of 268, in an innings in which the next highest score was 31 (by Mitchell Johnson batting at no. 10).

Katich opened the batting with Phillip Hughes for the first two Tests at Cardiff and Lord's but Hughes was dropped for the Third Test at Edgbaston due to poor form, so Katich was then partnered by Shane Watson for the final three Tests.

As INM technically only held 29.9% of voting shares and so lacked management control, it did not consolidate the results of the Tribune, which is loss-making, with accumulated losses of around €45 million since acquisition.Dublin, Ireland: The Phoenix, Stocks & Shares, Moneybags: 25 January 2008, \\"Tony O'Reilly outmanoeuvres Denis O'Brien\\" The Tribune went in to administration and closed in February 2011. The group launched Independent Colleges, which has its base on Dublin's Dawson Street, in 2007, and sold its education division in 2014. =United Kingdom= The Independent (of London) was bought for around €100 million in 1997 and up until March 2010 the title had made cumulative losses of least €150 million. The Independent and the Independent on Sunday newspapers were sold to a company controlled by Alexander Lebedev in March 2010. During 2007, INM opened a new full-colour Goss printing press facility in Newry, Co. Down. The press the Goss Flexible Printing System known as the FPS was the first FPS sold by Goss Preston. *Ireland's Saturday Night (closed in 2008) =South Africa= Until 2013, the group was the second biggest newspaper publisher in South Africa, owning 14 newspapers including The Star and Pretoria News in Gauteng, the Daily Voice, Cape Times, Cape Argus and Weekend Argus in Cape Town, The Mercury, Post, Isolezwe, Daily News, Sunday Tribune and Independent on Saturday in Durban, the Diamond Fields Advertiser in Kimberley, as well as the national Sunday Independent and 13 community newspapers in Cape Town. The group's titles account for 48% of the total advertising spend in paid newspapers, 22% of all newspapers sold in the country, and 63% of the English language market. In mid-2012, speculation began that INM would sell their South African operation. This was later confirmed. INM had initially hoped for 250 million EUR for INM SA, however bids came in at around 150 million EUR. Cape Town businessman Iqbal Surve's Sekunjalo Investments consortium were the front-runners to purchase INM SA. Inititally Sekunjalo was set to take a 75% stake in the consortium, but this was changed to 55%, with the remainder going to two government entities. The first of these is the investment arm of the SA government, and the second, an investment arm of the Chinese government. Commenting on the deal University of the Witwatersrand journalism professor Anton Harber said that \\"the ANC is working with their Chinese allies—ruling party to ruling party, in the way the Chinese government so often works—to increase their influence in our local media and counter what they view as a hostile media sector.\\"Geoffrey York (11 September 2013) Media agenda: China buys newsrooms, influence in Africa The Globe and Mail Bloomberg reported that Denis O'Brien met Jacob Zuma, president of South Africa, during a private meeting at the Hotel on 24 January 2013. He also met the broker negotiating the sale of INM SA. =Australia and New Zealand= The company owned a stake in APN News & Media Limited, a large newspaper publisher in Australia and New Zealand, which owns The New Zealand Herald and other newspapers, and is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. On 12 February 2007, INM announced that the board of APN had recommended an all-cash revised offer of A$6.10 per share for the entire issued share capital of APN. The subsequent bid to take APN News & Media Ltd private in May 2007 was unsuccessful. INL owned approximately 30% of APN at mid-2012 and sold it by March 2015. =India= INM previously entered into the Indian market, purchasing 20% of Dainik Jagran, the publishing company behind India's best-selling paper. This market has been identified by INM as being a key element of its move into non-English speaking media markets with huge growth opportunities and potential for advancement. Since the initial investment INM deepened its involvement by buying 20% of the radio business of Dainik Jagran. The intention is to establish eight radio stations in the so-called \\"Hindi Belt\\". In August 2010, INM sold its entire stake in Dainik Jagran. INM no longer have any Indian interests. =Other interests= INM also held stakes in the Unison ISP and the iTouch electronic payments and premium rate telecoms operator, the controlling stake in the latter later being sold to a Japanese firm. Cable The company formerly held a 50% stake in Chorus Communications, the second largest cable television and MMDS operator in Ireland, having acquired this with a merger between Cable Management Ireland, and their own Irish Multichannel. However this was sold in 2004. The group The chief executive is Vincent Crowley having succeeded Gavin O'Reilly in the role on 19 April 2012. O'Reilly had been CEO since 2009. The chairman is Brian Hillery, former Fianna Fáil politician and former members of the commission of the Central Bank of Ireland. The holding company website is inmplc.com and the group website is inm.. Controversies There have been questions about the policy of not consolidating the 98%-owned but loss-making Sunday Tribune, and on the other hand the practice of consolidating entirely the massively profitable APN News & Media, which was less than 41%-owned. In the half-year to June 2007, for example, the group reported operating profits of €155 million—but this excluded €1.5 million of losses from the Tribune, and included €85 million from APN (whereas a proportionate share of profit would have been, at that time, €32 million). There have also been questions about APN, which was acquired in transactions involving both the group and the O'Reilly family, and profited the latter greatly, and about the massive level of group debt (over €1.3 billion). Furthermore, there have been complaints about the level of power of the O'Reilly family, the independence or otherwise of the board, and about the costs of O'Reilly as CEO, with second-largest shareholder Denis O'Brien and others having noted travel costs from O'Reilly's primary home in the Bahamas, company payments towards his now second home in Kilcullen, near Dublin, on top of large salary and other contributions. The groups' failure to cover the controversy surrounding INM director Brian Mulroney has also been criticised. Mulroney was the subject of an inquiry by Canadian Privy Council because of his part in a scandal involving the purchase of Airbus by Air Canada, and also his relationship to German arms dealer Karlheinz Schreiber. The group's relationship with a variety of entertainment and public relationships firms via Clear Channel Independent has also been seen as problematic. Independent News and Media was identified by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) as an employer where \\"bullying\\" and \\"lack of support\\" was rampant. The survey said 93% of the respondent claimed they didn't receive proper support from the management and 20% of them complained of bullying at work. The survey also claimed 96% of the respondent complained that they had to work overtime and 55% of them said they were forced to do so. INM declined to comment on the survey.

It is part of the Southern Victory Series, following How Few Remain (set in the early 1880s) and trilogies Great War (World War I) and American Empire (interwar period). It takes the Southern Victory Series world from 1941 to 1944. Plot At the beginning of Return Engagement, North America is a continent divided. Canada, minus the independent Republic of Quebec, is under U.S. occupation — which, as the Confederacy re-arms and the United States redeploy forces south to meet them, has come to mean occupation by U.S.-allied Québécois soldiers. To the south, Kentucky and Houston have recently been returned to the Confederacy by popular vote with Houston also rejoining Texas. However, Sequoyah — having been flooded by U.S. citizens, and its original Native American inhabitants outnumbered, has voted to stay in the United States, but other formerly Confederate territories occupied by the United States after the Great War remain unredeemed. In total, Virginia north of Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock River has been annexed to West Virginia, a sliver of northeastern Arkansas is attached to Missouri, and a portion of northwestern Sonora (purchased by the Confederacy along with Chihuahua in 1881) is part of a larger New Mexico that also contains the real- life state of Arizona. The United States also control the formerly British island territories of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Newfoundland, Bermuda and the Bahamas; Cuba, purchased by the Confederacy from Spain in the 1870s, remains Confederate. On the international scale, the United Kingdom has reformed itself around conservative Prime Minister Winston Churchill and fascistic \\"silver shirts\\" led by Oswald Mosley. In the wake of another defeat by the hated Germans, the French Third Republic had collapsed under popular support for the hard-line Catholic and monarchistic Action Française around 1930 and is now under control of King Charles XI. Both countries are politically allied with the Confederacy, as are Japan (though it openly threatens Pacific European possessions) and Russia (the Russian Revolution never occurred; as was mentioned in the American Empire series, the \\"Great Man\\" and the \\"Man of Steel\\" (Lenin and Stalin) were defeated and killed by loyal forces at Tsaritsyn, aka Stalingrad/Volgograd). The United States is allied with the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, while Quebec stays neutral officially, but in fact continues to supply occupation soldiers to the United States for now-exclusively-English Canada. Ireland, with some material support from the United States, won its independence from Britain at the end of the Great War, but has now been invaded by British forces and exists in a state of guerilla war. On June 22, 1941, Confederate dictator Jake Featherston launches the war with a bombing attack on all major U.S. cities within reach of the border, quickly followed by an invasion of Ohio from Kentucky. Despite fierce U.S. resistance, the country is cut in half, though both sides remain linked by (risky) shipping and the rail network in occupied Canada, though it is occasionally subject to sabotage by the Canadian resistance. Meanwhile, the Mormon population of Utah rebels against the United States with support from the CSA, and proclaims the State of Deseret, forcing the United States to send troops to try to put down the uprising. Meanwhile, Japan attacks the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), sinking a U.S. carrier and threatening to capture the islands, and taking Midway Island, resulting in fierce naval and air battles. On the European Front, fighting breaks out between Germany and Austria, allies of the U.S., and Britain, Russia, and France, allies of the CSA. Minor fighting also takes place between American and Russian troops in Alaska. As the war progresses, Featherston launches a campaign of genocide against the country's black population. Many blacks arm themselves with U.S. aid and begin a campaign of resistance. Both sides launch air raids on enemy cities, and Confederate aircraft manage to kill U.S. President Al Smith during a raid on Philadelphia when it damages the Powel House, forcing the inexperienced Charles W. La Follette to take office, and resulting in a massive retaliatory raid on Richmond which fails to kill Featherston. The United States attempts a counter-attack by invading Virginia, but the advance bogs down under heavy resistance. Futile U.S. attempts to capture the heavily defended city of Fredericksburg result in heavy losses. The stall allows the Confederates to concentrate their forces in Ohio and push into Pennsylvania, with the support of Mexican forces, committed by Emperor Francisco Jose at the demands of Featherston. However, U.S. forces manage to prevent the encirclement of Pittsburgh, forcing the Confederates into heavy street fighting, where their advance stalls. Meanwhile, two U.S. escort carriers reach Oahu, and the tide begins to turn, as the Americans hold the Sandwich Islands. In a climactic battle, a Japanese carrier guarding Midway is sunk and Midway Island is retaken. Under the cover of an early November storm, U.S. forces launch an armored offensive, which quickly breaks through the Mexican units guarding the Confederate flanks. Joining with another salient moving out of West Virginia, the bulk of the invading Confederate army is encircled, and U.S. forces begin driving deeper into Confederate-occupied Ohio. An attempt by Confederate forces to reach Pittsburgh is stopped at Salem, and U.S. forces launch a number of incursions across Confederate territory, which prevents the Confederates from gathering enough troops to relieve their forces in Pittsburgh. One of the thrusts comes dangerously close to capturing a Confederate extermination camp and revealing its true purpose and its mass graves. Featherston refuses to allow his troops to fight their way out of Pittsburgh. Attempts to supply the besieged Confederates by air fail, and the remnants of the trapped Confederate army surrender, while Confederate control of Ohio crumbles. On the European front, British, French, and Russian forces are gradually pushed back, as Irish and Serb rebels continue to attack their occupiers, and fighting between two sets of guerrillas supported by either sides continues in Ukraine. Meanwhile, U.S. forces push into Confederate territory. Kentucky and Tennessee fall first, followed by an advance into Georgia. At the Battle of Chattanooga, American forces land paratroopers atop Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge rather than fight their way up. The Confederates squander resources through a series of futile counter-attacks. Meanwhile, a black revolt takes place in Richmond. As the genocide of blacks continues at the Concentration Camp known as Camp Determination, U.S. forces push into Texas. As these troops are lacking in resources, Confederate forces manage to stall them long enough for the Camp guards to murder all the blacks. Meanwhile, both sides are seeking a nuclear bomb, and the Confederates try to stall the U.S. nuclear program by bombing the U.S. nuclear project site in Washington, to which the U.S. replies by bombing the Confederate nuclear research site in Virginia. Meanwhile, the Mormon rebellion in Utah is finally crushed, but a British-supported Canadian uprising against occupation authorities is fully active, forcing American units who had been previously fighting the Mormons to be transferred to Canada and hold it down. In Virginia, the ground fighting seems largely quiet as the Confederates are unable to attack U.S. forces as often due to heavy casualties. Fighting also takes place in other Confederate states the U.S. invades, and in Sequoyah (Oklahoma), with both sides sabotaging oil wells there. The U.S. also begins smuggling arms to a nascent rebellion in Confederate Cuba, recaptures Bermuda in a costly action, and increases activity in the South Atlantic to cut off food shipments from South America to Britain. The U.S. demands the CSA's unconditional surrender: the Confederates refuse and fire two long-range rockets into Philadelphia. U.S. forces drive through the center of the CSA and cut it in half, while a second U.S. force drives through Virginia to capture Richmond, and eventually take it in heavy street fighting. With British aid, the Confederacy produces a fission bomb. Under the commands of Clarence Potter, Confederate troops dressed as their U.S. counterparts smuggle the bomb into Philadelphia and it detonates. However, this occurs on the outskirts of the city west of the Schuylkill River, and none of the government buildings are affected. The U.S. responds by bombing Newport News and Charleston. Six cities in Europe are also destroyed (Petrograd, Paris, London, Brighton, and Norwich) by Germany. The United Kingdom nukes Hamburg. After London, Brighton, and Norwich were nuked, Britain builds a second nuke. However, before the nuclear bomb could strike a major German city, it is shot down in German occupied Belgium, where it explodes harmlessly somewhere between Bruges and Ghent. Germany and Austria eventually defeat their European adversaries and kill or overthrow their heads of state. Japan, having failed to capture the Sandwich Islands and Midway, begins contemplating betraying its British allies and invading their colonies. Texas declares independence from the Confederacy and arrests Camp Determination officials. Featherston attempts to escape to the deep South, but his plane is shot down, and he is killed by an anti- Confederate guerilla. Confederate Vice President Don Partridge then takes office, and agrees to unconditionally surrender to the United States. Before the war officially ends, some Confederate units continue to resist, but when the time to surrender comes, they peacefully lay down their arms. Top Confederate officials are arrested, tried, and most of them are executed. The Confederates involved in the murder of blacks are also extradited from Texas, tried for crimes against humanity, and hanged. Despite the surrender, small bands of Confederates continue to resist, and the United States responds to each attack by executing random civilians unless the perpetrators turn themselves in or are captured, and then executed. The U.S. dissolves the Confederate government after 83 years and places the country under indefinite military occupation. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Houston are readmitted into the Union shortly after the war is over. The remaining states in the now former Confederacy will probably readmitted into the United States later. The rebellions in Canada are also suppressed, and Texas is given independence and hosts U.S. troops on its soil.

Also known as Abdul Rahman, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Muhajir, Abdel Rahman, Abu Turab, Ibrahim al-Muhajir al-Masri, and Mohammed K.A. al- Namer, he was wanted by the United States government in connection to the August 7, 1998 American embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. Atwah built both of the bombs used in the attacks. For his role in the attacks, he was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Consequently, on October 10, 2001, Atwah was placed on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President Bush. Atwah had been a member of al-Qaeda since at least 1990 and provided explosives training in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan, according to his indictment.

Design and development The AM 3 prototype displayed at the Paris Air Salon in June 1967 The AM.3 used the wing design of the Aermacchi AL-60 utility aircraft, strengthened to incorporate two hardpoints. The fuselage was a new design.Simpson, 2001, p. 6 The first prototype, constructed by Aermacchi, flew on 12 May 1967, and it was displayed at the Paris air show in June that year. The second prototype, constructed by AERFER, flew on 22 August 1968, but the aircraft lost the Italian Army contract to the SIAI Marchetti SM.1019. Nevertheless, Aeritalia continued development. The third prototype used a more powerful Piaggio-built Lycoming GSO-480-B1B6 in place of the original Continental GTSIO-520-C, and this variant was designated AM.3C Pilot and observer are accommodated in tandem positions, and the craft features dual controls. Aft space is utilitarian, providing space for two stretchers or seat space for additional passengers. Additional configurations include freight transport. Armament configurations are diverse, as well. Two standard underwing pylons were able to carry 170 kg (375 lb) of stores each. Typical armament includes machine guns, rockets, bombs and missiles. Reconnaissance packs could be fitted to, or inside of, the fuselage. Additional pylons were often added by customers. Bosbok Bosbok cockpit In September 1970 the South African Air Force ordered 40 AM.3Cs, designating the aircraft the AM.3CM Bosbok (Bush-buck). The first aircraft was taken on charge in March 1973, with deliveries continuing until December 1975, equipping 41 Squadron and 42 Squadron. The Bosbok saw extensive action during the South African military operations in Angola between 1975 and 1989, during which it wore an olive-drab/dark earth camouflage instead of the light-grey paintscheme in which it was delivered. The SAAF's Bosboks had four underwing hardpoints from which a variety of ordnance could be hung, including machine gun pods, light bombs and smoke-rocket pods. Each of the two inner hardpoints was stressed for a 170 kg (375 lb) load, with the two outer points being stressed for a 91 kg (200 lb) load. Roles performed by the Bosbok in SAAF service include: * Forward air control * Radio relay (referred to as \\"Telstar duty\\" by the SAAF) * Target marking (using smoke-rockets) * Reconnaissance/observation (including artillery spotting) * Casevac * Liaison It was in the dangerous role of target-marking that the Bosbok really excelled, in which it used the following technique: the aircraft would run in to the target at tree-top height, pull up to around 92 m (300 ft) when nearly overhead the target, line up the nose on the target and release the rockets, before quickly turning away and diving back to tree-top level to avoid ground- fire. Using this method, a Bosbok was once credited with destroying an entire 37 mm anti-aircraft gun position with a lucky direct hit from one of its smoke marker rockets. Following the end of South Africa's involvement in the Angolan War in 1989 and the subsequent downsizing of the SAAF, the Bosbok was retired from service in 1992.

The idea was that by relying on each other, sharing their alcoholic experiences and creating an atmosphere of conviviality, they could keep each other sober. Total abstinence from alcohol (teetotalism) was their goal. The group taught sobriety and preceded Alcoholics Anonymous by almost a century. Members sought out other \\"drunkards\\" (the term alcoholic had not yet been created), told them their experiences with alcohol abuse and how the Society had helped them achieve sobriety. With the passage of time the Society became a prohibitionist organization in that it promoted the legal and mandatory prohibition of alcoholic beverages. The Society was the inspiration for Timothy Shay Arthur's Six Nights with the Washingtonians and his Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. The Washingtonians differed from other organizations in the temperance movement in that they focused on the individual alcoholic rather than on society's greater relationship with liquor. In the mid-19th century, a temperance movement was in full sway across the United States and temperance workers advanced their anti-alcohol views on every front. Public temperance meetings were frequent and the main thread was prohibition of alcohol and pledges of sobriety to be made by the individual. The Inebriate Home of Long Island, detail from the Taylor Map of New York (1879) Concurrent with this movement, a loose network of facilities both public and private offered treatment to drunkards. Referred to as inebriate asylums and reformatory homes, they included the New York State Inebriate Asylum, The Inebriate Home of Long Island, N.Y., the Home for Incurables in San Francisco, the Franklin Reformatory Home in Philadelphia and the Washingtonian Homes which opened in Boston and Chicago in 1857. Washingtonians at their peak numbered in the tens of thousands, possibly as high as 600,000. However, in the space of just a few years, this society all but disappeared because they became fragmented in their primary purpose, becoming involved with all manner of controversial social reforms including prohibition, sectarian religion, politics and abolition of slavery. It is believed that Abraham Lincoln attended and spoke at one of the great revivals, presumably not for treatment, but out of interest in various issues being discussed. The Washingtonians drifted away from their initial purpose of helping the individual alcoholic, and disagreements, infighting, and controversies over prohibition eventually destroyed the group. The Washingtonians became so thoroughly extinct that, some 50 years later in 1935 when William Griffith Wilson (\\"Bill\\") and Dr. Robert Smith (\\"Dr. Bob\\") joined together in forming Alcoholics Anonymous, neither of them had ever heard of the Washingtonians. Although comparisons are made between the Washingtonians and Alcoholics Anonymous, in some respects they have more in common with modern secular addiction recovery groups. The Washingtonians were so non- religious and non-spiritual that religious critics accused them of humanism, placing themselves before the power of God.

A prolific writer whose œuvre spans more than half a century and a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary modernism. His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science fiction to novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night) was published in 1956, one year before his death. Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin moved with his mother and siblings to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again at the start of the Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect. Despite the canonic status of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often characterized as an under-recognized or even as a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) over the last few decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other German novelists such as Thomas Mann, Günter Grass or Franz Kafka. Life =Early life= Alfred Döblin bronze bust, by Siegfried Wehrmeister Bruno Alfred Döblin was born on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city in what was then the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five children born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. His older brother was actor Hugo Döblin. His parent's marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism.; The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on. His parents' marriage dissolved in July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, and moved to America to start a new life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, but when it came to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889. The sense of being déclassé, along with rocky experiences at school, made this a difficult time for Döblin.; Although he had early been a good student, starting in his fourth year of Gymnasium his performance tended toward the mediocre. Furthermore, his oppositional tendencies against the stern conventionality of the patriarchal, militaristic Wilhelminian educational system, which stood in contrast to his artistic inclinations and his free thought, earned him the status of a rebel among his teachers. Despite his hatred for school, Döblin early became a passionate writer and reader, counting Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among his most important early influences. He wrote his first novel, Jagende Rosse (Rushing Steeds), before completing school and dedicated it to the \\"Manes of Hölderlin\\". He sent a copy to the prominent critic and philosopher Fritz Mauthner who returned it a few days later. However, wishing to hide his artistic inclinations from his mother, Döblin had sent the manuscript under a false name, and was not able to retrieve it at the post office; he thus had to rewrite it entirely. =1900–1914: University years and early career= After receiving his Abitur in 1900, Döblin enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm University (now Humboldt University of Berlin) and began studying general medicine. In May 1904 he moved to Freiburg im Breisgau to continue his studies, concentrating on neurology and psychiatry. He began his dissertation (\\"Disturbances of memory in Korsakoff's Psychosis\\") in the winter semester of 1904–1905 at the Freiburg psychiatric clinic. His dissertation, completed in April 1905, was published that year by Berlin's Klett Verlag. He applied for assistantships in Berlin and in Stettin, where he was apparently turned down on account of his Jewish origins, before taking a short-lived position as assistant doctor at a regional asylum in Regensburg. On 15 October 1906 he took up a position at the Berlin psychiatric clinic in Buch where he worked as an assistant doctor for nearly two years. He then transferred to the city hospital \\"Am Urban,\\" where he dedicated himself to internal medicine with a renewed interest. He opened his first private practice in October 1911 at Blücherstrasse 18 in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighborhood, before moving the practice to Frankfurter Allee 184 in Berlin's working-class east. Illustrated title page of Döblin's novella \\"Das Stiftsfräulein und der Tod\\"; woodcut by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner While working in Buch he met Friede Kunke, a 16-year-old nurse from a Protestant background with whom he became romantically involved. In the spring of 1909 he began seeing the 21-year-old Erna Reiss, a medical student and daughter of a wealthy Jewish factory owner. Despite his continued involvement with Kunke, at the urging of his family he was reluctantly engaged to Reiss on 13 February 1911 and married her on 23 January 1912; his older brother Hugo and Herwarth Walden served as best men. During the early part of his engagement to Reiss, he had been unaware that Kunke was pregnant: their son Bodo was born on 14 October 1911 and was raised by his grandmother, Elise Kunke, in Schleswig-Holstein following Friede's death from tuberculosis in 1918. Until the end of his life, Döblin maintained loose contact with Bodo, and his treatment of Friede became a lasting source of guilt. Döblin's first son with Erna Reiss, Peter Döblin, was born on 27 October 1912, and was baptized a Protestant.; Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's portrait of Alfred Döblin During his studies in Berlin, Döblin had written his second novel, Der Schwarze Vorhang (The Black Curtain).; The novel portrays the developing sexuality of its protagonist, Johannes, and explores the themes of love, hate, and sadism; in its use of literary montage, The Black Curtain already presages the radical techniques that Döblin would later pioneer in Berlin Alexanderplatz. Introduced by a mutual acquaintance, Döblin met Georg Lewin, a music student better known as Herwarth Walden, who founded the Expressionist journal Der Sturm in 1910. Der Sturm, modeled after Karl Kraus's newspaper Die Fackel (The Torch), would soon count Döblin among its most involved contributors, and provided him with a venue for the publication of numerous literary and essayistic contributions. Through Walden Döblin made the acquaintance of poet Else Lasker-Schüler. At regular meetings at the Café des Westens on Kurfürstendamm or at the wine bar Dalbelli, Döblin got to know the circle of artists and intellectuals that would become central to the Expressionist movement in Berlin, including Peter Hille, Richard Dehmel, Erich Mühsam, Paul Scheerbart, and Frank Wedekind, among others. In October 1911 he met the painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, who painted several portraits of Döblin between 1912 and 1914 and illustrated some of Döblin's literary works. Döblin's early novel Der Schwarze Vorhang was published in Der Sturm, and in November 1912 the Munich publishing house Georg Müller published his collection of novellas under the title Die Ermordung einer Butterblume und andere Erzählungen. In May 1913, he completed his third novel The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Published in 1916, this historical novel about political uprising in 18th-century China was a literary breakthrough for Döblin, earning him literary acclaim, public recognition, and the prestigious Fontane Prize.; He began writing Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle with the Steam Turbine) the following year, completing it by December 1914 although it was not published until 1918. =1915–1933: The First World War and the Weimar years= To avoid conscription, Döblin volunteered in December 1914 and was posted to Saargemünd (Sarreguemines) as a doctor. Despite sharing in the widespread early enthusiasm for the war among German intellectuals, he soon developed a pacifist disposition. His son Wolfgang was born on 17 March 1915, followed by the births of Klaus on 20 May 1917 and Stefan on 7 December 1926. In Saargemünd the family lived in a small apartment at Neunkircherstraße 19; due to their financial situation they had to give up their Berlin apartment at the end of February 1915. Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun At the end of August, 1916, Döblin was awarded the Fontane Prize (including a monetary award of 600 Marks) for The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself to work on his historical novel Wallenstein, set during the Thirty Years' War. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in Alsace, where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919. At the beginning of 1919, Döblin moved into his new apartment and medical practice at Frankfurter Allee 340 in Berlin. The immediate postwar period was a turbulent time for him—his financial situation was dire, and the death of his sister Meta on 12 March 1919 as the result of an injury sustained during skirmishes between the Spartacists and nationalist troops in Berlin showed how volatile the situation in Germany was in the aftermath of the November Revolution.; ; The years during and immediately after the war also marked Döblin's growing politicization; although he never joined a party he identified with the political left. During this time Döblin wrote a number of satirical and polemical political essays under the pseudonym \\"Linke Poot,\\" a dialectical variation of \\"Linke Pfote\\" (Left Paw), eleven of which were published in 1921 in a volume called Der deutsche Maskenball (The German Masked Ball).; In February 1921, he met the 21-year-old photographer Charlotte (\\"Yolla\\") Niclas; the close romantic relationship between the two was to last many years, despite their age difference.; The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt, and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928. Commemorative plaque on Döblin's Berlin residence At the end of September 1924, he set out on a two-month trip through Poland, subsidized by the Fischer Verlag and prompted in part by the anti-Semitic pogroms in Berlin's Scheunenviertel of 1923, an event that awakened Döblin's interest in Judaism.; ; His description of his travels to Warsaw, Vilnius, Lviv, and Kraków, among other cities, was published in November 1925 under the title Reise in Polen (Journey to Poland). From 1926 to 1927 Döblin worked on his free verse epic Manas, about a figure from Indian mythology, which was published in May 1927. Manas, like his philosophical tract Das Ich über der Natur published the same year, proved to be a failure with the public. Thus despite his continued rise to prominence within the intellectual world of the Weimar Republic—in 1928, for example, he was elected to the prestigious Prussian Academy of Arts with the persistent support of Thomas Mann—literary and economic success continued to elude Döblin. This changed with the October 1929 publication of his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz which earned him national and global fame.; One of the best known appraisals of the novel is Walter Benjamin's essay, \\"Die Krisis des Romans\\" (\\"The Crisis of the Novel\\") which sees in Berlin Alexanderplatz radical use of montage a solution to the impasses of the traditional novel. Döblin soon began transforming Berlin Alexanderplatz into a radio play and agreed to cowrite the screenplay for the film version that premiered on 8 October 1931.For a detailed study on the adaption of Berlin Alexanderplatz across genres and media, see The early 1930s marked the high point of Döblin's fame. During this time he busied himself with lectures, readings, and the effort to contribute to a collective intellectual response to the growing power of the National Socialists. Just over a month after Hitler's ascension to power, Döblin left Germany, crossing into Switzerland on 2 March 1933. = 1933–1957: Exile and later life = Alfred Döblin, ca. 1946 After a brief stay in Zürich, the family moved to Paris. Döblin's closest acquaintances during this time were Claire and Yvan Goll, Hermann Kesten, Arthur Koestler, Joseph Roth, Hans Sahl, and Manès Sperber. Here he also saw Robert Musil, with whom he had kept up a sporadic relationship for over a decade, for the last time. Döblin finished his novel Babylonische Wandrung at the end of 1933. In 1935, he began work on his Amazon Trilogy, which narrates the colonization and Christianization of South America and was published in 1937–1938. During this time he also began work on his four-part novel project November 1918 about the revolution in Germany at the end of the First World War. He acquired French nationality in October 1936. In May 1939, he briefly visited the United States to take part in a PEN congress in New York. With other writers, he met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House, and saw his old Berlin acquaintance Ernst Toller again, who was suffering from severe depression and killed himself shortly thereafter. After the start of the Second World War the family fled Paris, while Döblin's manuscripts were stored in the basement of the Sorbonne. Between the start of the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel. In 1940, aged 62, he was again uprooted by the German invasion of France, and spent weeks in a refugee camp in Mende.; During this time, he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende, taking a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940, Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for $100 a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.; ; Döblin completed work on November 1918 in the spring of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears. Döblin's gravestone in Housseras, France In 1945, Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan was called up for military service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945, Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative for the office of public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953, Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin. His last novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night), was published in 1956, and was favorably received. Döblin's remaining years were marked by poor health (he had Parkinson's disease) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his alma mater, Freiburg University. Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim Tiburtius, he was able to receive more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10,000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses. Alfred Döblin died in the hospital in Emmendingen on 26 June 1957 and was buried two days later in the village cemetery at Housseras next to his son Wolfgang. Erna took her life on 15 September and was buried next to Alfred. Major works =The Three Leaps of Wang Lun= Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun) was Döblin's third novel (although it was the first to be published as a book), and garnered him the Fontane Prize. Published in 1916, (although back-dated to 1915), this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th-century China, and was favorably received by critics, who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China.; Wang Lun also had an influence on younger German writers, including Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers, and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, Wang Lun provided an impulse for the development of the theory of epic theatre. In commercial sales, it is Döblin's most successful novel after Berlin Alexanderplatz. =Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine= Cover of the first edition of Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine Döblin's 1918 comic novel has been seen, in its experimental narrative technique, its refusal to psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz.; Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) tells the story of Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht. =Wallenstein= Although Döblin's 1920 epic about the Thirty Years' War was in general favorably received by critics, he was disappointed with the reception because he felt he had created in Wallenstein a peerless work; as a consequence, he wrote a scathing critique of critics which he published in 1921 under the title Der Epiker, sein Stoff und die Kritik (The Epic Poet, his Material, and Critique). The novel centers on the tension between Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and his general, Albrecht von Wallenstein; Wallenstein represents a new type of warfare characterized by ruthless Realpolitik and capitalist expansion while Ferdinand becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the course of events and gradually retreats from politics altogether. Döblin's approach to narrating the war differed from prevailing historiography in that, rather than interpreting the Thirty Years' War primarily as a religious conflict, he portrays it critically as the absurd consequence of a combination of national-political, financial, and individual psychological factors. Döblin saw a strong similarity between the Thirty Years' War and the First World War, during which he wrote Wallenstein. The novel is counted among the most innovative and significant historical novels in the German literary tradition. =Berge Meere und Giganten= Döblin's 1924 science fiction novel recounts the course of human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global struggle between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others.; Stylistically and structurally experimental, it was regarded as a difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics.; ; Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight. The central episode of the novel - the destruction of Iceland to provide heat to melt the Greenland icecap - has been translated into English at Beyond Alexanderplatz - Alfred Döblin's OTHER writings, in English. =Manas= This remarkable but almost totally neglected epic in free verse immediately preceded Döblin's best-known work Berlin Alexanderplatz. That both works were closely associated in Döblin's mind is shown by a remark in his Afterword to the 1955 East German edition of his big- city masterpiece: it was Manas with a Berlin accent, Praised on its publication by Robert Musil among others (I assert with confidence that this work should have the greatest influence!) it has attracted strangely little attention from Döblin scholars. Manas Part 1 tells the story of a war-hero suddenly struck with an existential realisation of Death. He demands to be taken to Shiva's Field of the Dead in the high Himalaya to commune with Souls on their way to dissolution. Having imbibed several dreadful life stories he falls unconscious, and his body is invaded by three demons who plan to use it to go down to the human world. Manas' guardian, Puto, attempting to drive out the demons, inadvertently kills the body, and Manas's soul wafts back onto the Field. Puto conveys the body back to Udaipur, then returns to the mountains to fight the demons. In Part 2, Savitri, Manas' wife, refuses to believe her husband is dead, and makes her arduous way up into the mountains to find him. Shiva becomes aware of her presence on his Field, and makes contact across their different dimensions. Savitri is able to couple with Manas' soul, and he is reborn into his body. Savitri, revealed now as the Universal Female, rejoins Shiva on Mount Kailash. In Part 3, the reborn Manas rejoices in his physicality, but does not understand where he fits into the world. He comes upon Puto fighting the three demons, captures them, and is carried by them back down into the world. A village priest declares that Manas and the demons make up a single new terrible being: likely meaning a human no longer innocent but equipped with Id, Ego and Superego. When Manas destroys a temple, Shiva comes down to subdue him, but Manas' Ego calls out to the natural world, and Shiva has to release him, transforming the demons into sleek winged panthers on which Manas rides to connect Souls longing to return with humans tired of life. This powerful and sometimes puzzling story is told in a vigorous, direct and dramatic language, with constantly shifting moods and voices. In order to make it more accessible to English readers in the absence of any guidance from reviewers, the translator C D Godwin has adapted it as a Play for Voices, available for download at the website Beyond Alexanderplatz: Alfred Döblin's OTHER writings, in English. =Berlin Alexanderplatz= Generally considered Döblin's masterpiece, Berlin Alexanderplatz has become an iconic text of the Weimar Republic. Published in 1929, its innovative use of literary montage as well as its panoramic portrayal of a modern metropolis have earned it a place among the key works of literary modernism. Berlin Alexanderplatz tells the story of Franz Biberkopf, who as the novel opens has just been released from prison for killing his lover. Although he seeks to become respectable, he is quickly drawn into a struggle \\"with something that comes from without, that is unpredictable and looks like a destiny.\\" Biberkopf suffers a series of setbacks and catastrophes, including the murder of his lover and the loss of an arm. The novel earned Döblin global recognition and literary celebrity, and was translated into English in 1931 by Eugene Jolas, a friend of James Joyce. It has been filmed twice, once in the 1931 Berlin-Alexanderplatz, directed by Phil Jutzi and starring Heinrich George as Biberkopf, and then again in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1980 14-part television film. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers from around the world, Berlin Alexanderplatz was named among the top 100 books of all time.The top 100 books of all time, Guardian Unlimited, May 8, 2002 =November 1918: A German Revolution= November 1918: A German Revolution (November 1918, eine deutsche Revolution) is a novel tetralogy about the German Revolution of 1918–1919.; The four volumes—Vol. I: Bürger und Soldaten (Citizens and Soldiers), Vol. II Verratenes Volk (A People Betrayed), Vol. III, Heimkehr der Fronttruppen (Return of the Frontline Troops), and Vol. IV, Karl und Rosa (Karl and Rosa)—together comprise the most significant work from Döblin's period of exile (1933–1945). The work was highly praised by figures such as Bertolt Brecht, and critic Gabriele Sander has described November 1918 as representing the culmination of Döblin's work in the genre of the historical novel. =Tales of a Long Night= Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night) (1956) was Döblin's last novel. Set in England immediately after the Second World War, the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison, an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war. Back among his family, Edward must deal with his war trauma, long buried family conflicts, and his destabilized sense of self. The novel treats such themes as the search for the self, guilt and responsibility, the struggle between the sexes, war and violence, and religion, among others. Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946, although it was not published until a decade later. Upon its 1956 release by the East Berlin publishing house Rütten & Loening, the novel was well received. The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin's reading of Sigmund Freud's interpretation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Legacy East German stamp commemorating Döblin Döblin is generally considered one of the most important German writers of the twentieth century; yet popular perception of his work rests almost exclusively on Berlin Alexanderplatz, considered the canonical German novel of the modern metropolis (\\"Großstadtroman\\").; ; ; His writing is characterized by an innovative use of montage and perspectival play, as well as what he dubbed in 1913 a \\"fantasy of fact\\" (\\"Tatsachenphantasie\\")—an interdisciplinary poetics that draws on modern discourses ranging from the psychiatric to the anthropological to the theological, in order to \\"register and articulate sensory experience and to open up his prose to new areas of knowledge.\\" His engagement with such key movements of the European avant-garde as futurism, expressionism, dadaism, and Neue Sachlichkeit has led critic Sabina Becker to call him \\"perhaps the most significant representative of literary modernism in Berlin.\\" In a 1967 essay, Günter Grass declared: \\"Without the Futurist elements of Döblin's work from Wang Lun to Berlin Alexanderplatz, my prose is inconceivable.\\"; on Döblin's influence on Grass, see Döblin was also an influence on writers such as W.G. Sebald and Bertolt Brecht; as Brecht wrote in 1943, \\"I learned more about the essence of the epic from Döblin than from anyone else. His epic writing and even his theory about the epic strongly influenced my own dramatic art.\\" Modern, well-edited, critical volumes of almost the complete œuvre have been appearing in German since the 1980s, published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and, since 2008, by the Fischer Verlag; and the Internationale Alfred-Döblin Kolloquien have been held every two years since the early 1980s. But only a handful of other works of fiction have ever appeared in English translations: The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (trans. C. D. Godwin, Chinese University Press, Hong Kong, 1991), and the November 1918 trilogy: A People Betrayed (which also includes The Troops Return) and Karl and Rosa (trans. John E. Woods, Fromm International, 1983 and 1987); Tales of a Long Night (trans John E Woods, From International, 1987; and the lesser-known big-city novel Men without Mercy (trans.

He is best remembered for participating in the vote breaking the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the US Senate while partially paralyzed and unable to speak, shortly before his death from a brain tumor.  Early life Engle was born in Bakersfield, to Fred Engle, a rancher who had been a teacher and a lawyer, and his wife, Carita. His parents named him after his aunt, who had assisted in his birth, and his name would become the source of many folksy stories over the years. Like his two brothers, he was active in outdoor activities and attended public schools in Shasta and Tehama Counties. His fellow students at Red Bluff High School elected him their student body president. In 1928, he enrolled at Chico State Teachers College, and he graduated in 1930. He then attended University of California Hastings College of the Law, and graduated in 1933. Although Engle had a reputation for straight-laced religiosity at both institutions, he eloped to marry his first wife, Hazel. They divorced in 1948 and Engle married his second wife, Lucretia Caldwell, a congressional secretary from San Jose. Early career Admitted to the California bar in 1933, Engle set up a practice in Corning and soon ran for District Attorney of Tehama County. Just 23 years old at the time of his victory, he would hold that office from 1934 to 1942. In 1942, he won election to the California Senate, representing Tehama, Glenn and Colusa Counties but ended up serving in that body for little more than a year. His main accomplishment was passing a law to allow the conversion of unused fairgrounds in order to house migrant farmworkers and ease a severe labor shortage.  U.S. Representative  On August 31, 1943, Engle was elected as a Democrat to represent California's 2nd congressional district in the 78th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Harry Lane Englebright. Although the district had more Republican than Democratic voters, Englebright's widow and another candidate split the Republican vote. Engle was elected to a full term in 1944 and re-elected to the following six Congresses, serving until January 3, 1959. At that time, the district consisted of 18 counties in northern California, and only the district in Nevada was physically larger. Thus, Engle used his pilot's license to campaign and meet with constituents. He was dubbed the \\"flying congressman\\" and once flew solo to his home in California from the Hybla Valley Airport in Alexandria, Virginia. He was sometimes jokingly referred to as \\"Congressman Fireball\\" because of his activity, his colorful language, the location of the geologically active Mount Lassen in his district, and the clouds of smoke from his cigars. In the U.S. House of Representatives he became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on War Claims for the 79th Congress and Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs for the 84th Congress and the 85th Congress. He sponsored several major expansions of the California Central Valley Project as well as the Saline Water Conversion Research Program, and a low-interest loan program relating to small irrigation projects. He also became known as a key supporter of the Taft–Hartley Act, which did not prevent him from being nominated by both parties when he sought re-election.  U.S. Senator  Engle won election as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1958, the year of a Democratic landslide. He defeated the incumbent Governor Goodwin J. Knight, thus becoming the first Democrat elected to that Senate seat in the 20th century. He succeeded William F. Knowland, who had given up the seat in an unsuccessful run for governor, losing to Pat Brown. He began his term on January 3, 1959. He worked with Senator Thomas Kuchel to pass the San Luis water project, the West Coast powertie and the Point Reyes National Seashore. He also promoted federal public transit assistance and civil rights legislation to assist his urban constituents. However, on August 24, 1963, Senator Engle underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor, which left him partially paralyzed, forcing him to miss several Senate sessions, and he ultimately withdrew from his re-election campaign. On April 13, 1964, the gravity of Engle's health problems was evident as he attempted to introduce a resolution calling for a delay in constructing the Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant at Bodega Head, located in Sonoma County. He was given permission to speak, but was unable; a colleague presented the resolution instead. Engle officially ended his re-election campaign on April 28, 1964, just four days after undergoing his second brain operation in eight months. He chose not to endorse either of his Democratic challengers, California State Controller Alan Cranston and former presidential press secretary Pierre Salinger. That decision came because state Democratic leaders refused to endorse him unless he provided details concerning his health. On June 10, 1964, during the roll call for the historic, successful effort to break the filibuster on what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when the clerk reached \\"Mr. Engle\\", there was no reply. The tumor had robbed Engle of his ability to speak. Slowly lifting an arm, he pointed to his eye, thereby signaling his affirmative vote (\\"aye\\").The NewsHour, Democratic Senator Johnson in Critical Condition, December 14, 2006. Retrieved December 29, 2006. The cloture vote was 71–29, four votes more than the two thirds required to end the filibuster.Associated Press account of June 10, 1964, as reported in 'The Oakland Tribune' Nine days later, the Senate approved the Act itself. Death and legacy Engle died in Washington, D.C., a month and a half later, aged 52. He was survived by his parents, his wife and his daughter from his first marriage, Yvonne Engle Childs. The Senate Chaplain led the memorial service at Fort Myer, Virginia, which Chief Justice Earl Warren attended. Approximately 3,000 mourners attended his funeral in Red Bluff at the First Methodist Church. He was buried in the Oak Hill cemetery. Trinity Lake, in California's Trinity County, was renamed for him, but the name Trinity Lake continued to be commonly used; eventually, the lake's original name was officially restored. His papers are held in the library at California State University, Chico. The city of Shasta Lake named a park and community center after him.

For massage, viscosity is a major consideration; for example, grape seed oil is typically very thin, while olive oil is much thicker. Sunflower, sweet almond and grape seed oils have viscosities midway between these extremes. Carrier oils can be easily blended to combine their properties of viscosity, acceptability, lubrication, absorption, aroma and so forth. Infused oils are a combination of a carrier oil and plant material and they can be either commercially or domestically prepared. A base oil, often sunflower, is placed in an airtight container with the appropriate plant material for a time. Calendula and carrot oils are produced in this way. High quality oils sold for culinary use are often eminently suitable for massage use, and are economical; those obtained by cold pressing are preferred. All carrier oils should be kept cool, and away from strong light, to retard rancidification. Rancid oils should be avoided. Refrigerating oils helps preserve their freshness but some oils should not be refrigerated (e.g. avocado). Very cold oils may appear cloudy, but regain their clear state on returning to room temperature. Sources passionately disagree on the suitability of mineral oil as a carrier oil.

The word comes from the same roots as effectiveness, and it has often been used synonymously, although in pharmacology a distinction is now often made between efficacy and effectiveness. The word efficacy is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer both to the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings.  Pharmacology  In pharmacology, efficacy () is the maximum response achievable from an applied or dosed agent, for instance, a small molecule drug. Intrinsic activity is a relative term for a drug's efficacy relative to a drug with the highest observed efficacy. It is a purely descriptive term that has little or no mechanistic interpretation. In order for a drug to have an effect, it needs to bind to its target, and then to affect the function of this target. The target of a drug is commonly referred to as a receptor, but can in general be any chemically sensitive site on any molecule found in the body. The nature of such binding can be quantified by characterising how tightly these molecules, the drug and its receptor, interact: this is known as the affinity. Efficacy, on the other hand, is a measure of the action of a drug once binding has occurred. The maximum response, , will be reduced if efficacy is sufficiently low. The definition of efficacy has been object for discussion. The only way in which absolute measures of efficacy have been obtained is by single ion channel analysis of ligand gated ion channels. It is still not possible to do this for G protein-linked receptors. In the case of the glycine receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (muscle type), it has been proposed by Sivilotti et al. that opening of the ion channel involves two steps after agonist is bound. Firstly a conformation change to a higher affinity (but still shut) form, followed by the conformation change from shut to open. It was found that partial agonism results from deficiency in the first step, and that the opening and shutting steps are essentially the same for both full and partial agonists. This has been confirmed and extended by Sine and colleagues (2009). The implication of this work is that efficacy has to be defined by at least two equilibrium constants (or, more generally, by four rate constants). The combined influences of affinity and efficacy determine how effectively a drug will produce a biological effect, a property known as potency.  Medicine  In medicine, efficacy is the capacity for beneficial change (or therapeutic effect) of a given intervention (for example a drug, medical device, surgical procedure, or a public health intervention). Establishment of the efficacy of an intervention is often done relative to other available interventions, with which it will be compared. Specifically, efficacy refers to \\"whether a drug demonstrates a health benefit over a placebo or other intervention when tested in an ideal situation, such as a tightly controlled clinical trial.\\" These studies focus on a primary parameter to be shown statistically different between placebo and intervention groups. Comparisons of this type are called 'explanatory' randomized controlled trials, whereas 'pragmatic' trials are used to establish the effectiveness of an intervention regarding also non-specific parameters. Effectiveness refers \\"how the drug works in a real-world situation,\\" and is \\"often lower than efficacy because of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient, sufficient dose or duration of use not prescribed by the physician or followed by the patient, or use for an off-label condition that had not been tested.\\" Theology =Scripture= In Reformed Theology (esp. in Lutheran but also in Calvinist doctrine) efficacy is an attribute of Scripture. The efficacy of Scripture means that it is united with the power of the Holy Spirit and with it, not only demands, but also creates the acceptance of its teaching, and that this teaching produces faith and obedience. Efficacy further means that Holy Scripture is not a dead letter, but rather, the power of the Holy Spirit is inherent in it, , , and that Scripture does not compel a mere intellectual assent to its doctrine, resting on logical argumentation, but rather it creates the living agreement of faith., , The Smalcald Articles affirm, \\"in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word.\\"Smalcald Articles, part 8, \\"Of Confession\\" The Formula of Concord teaches that when humans reject the calling of the Holy Spirit, it is not a result of the Word being less efficacious. Instead, contempt for the means of grace is the result of \\"the perverse will of man, which rejects or perverts the means and instrument of the Holy Ghost, which God offers him through the call, and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious, and works through the Word...\\"Solid Declaration, article xii, \\"Election\\", par. 41 =Prayer=  See also  *Efficiency (disambiguation) *Placebo (origins of technical term) *Potency (pharmacology) *Vaccine efficacy *Average treatment effect *Pragmatic clinical trial  References  Category:Medical terminology Category:Pharmacodynamics ","title":"Efficacy"},{"id":"896472","text":"Canadian Forces Base Valcartier (CFB Valcartier), now re-designated 2 Canadian Division Support Base Valcartier (2 CDSB Valcartier), is a Canadian Forces base located in the municipality of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, north northwest of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.Base militaire ValcartierCentre Castor - Base militaire de Valcartier The 2nd Canadian Division is stationed at the base,2nd Canadian Division Support Base Valcartier comprising the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and the 2nd Canadian Division Support Group.2nd Canadian Division Support Group  Origins  CFB Valcartier was originally erected as a military training camp in August 1914The Valcartier tour de force8 septembre 1914: le Camp Valcartier plein à craquer as part of the mobilization of the Canadian Expeditionary Force at the onset of World War I.History of 5 CMBG Inaugurated by Jean Chrétien, then Prime Minister of Canada, in 1995, a high bronze figure of a World War I soldier (1995) by André Gauthier at the entrance to CFB Valcartier commemorates the training of Canadian Army volunteers for the European battlefields in World War I.The Birchall Leadership AwardBase militaire de Valcartier, Québec The site was also used as an internment camp for \\"enemy aliens\\", mainly eastern Europeans.Camps d’internement au Canada: un fonds pour se souvenir The name Valcartier comes from the town of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier,A Bit of History of which a large section was expropriated in order to create the military training camp.

It is considered one of the most important and innovative works of the Weimar Republic.; ; ; In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers the book was named among the top 100 books of all time.The top 100 books of all time, Guardian Unlimited, May 8, 2002 Summary The story concerns a murderer, Franz Biberkopf, fresh from prison. When his friend murders the prostitute on whom Biberkopf has been relying as an anchor, he realizes that he will be unable to extricate himself from the underworld into which he has sunk. He must deal with misery, lack of opportunities, crime and the imminent ascendency of Nazism. During his struggle to survive against all odds, life rewards him with an unsuspected surprise but his happiness will not last as the story continues. Focus and narrative technique The novel is set in the working-class neighborhoods near Alexanderplatz in 1920s Berlin. Although its narrative style is sometimes compared to that of James Joyce's, critics such as Walter Benjamin have drawn a distinction between Ulysses’ interior monologue and Berlin Alexanderplatz's use of montage. Oliver Kamm, writing in the London Times, says Döblin's methods are more akin to Kafka in his use of \\"erlebte Rede (roughly, experienced speech — a blending of first-person and third-person narrative)\\". The novel is told from multiple points of view, and uses sound effects, newspaper articles, songs, speeches, and other books to propel the plot forward. Translations The novel was translated into English in 1931 by Eugene Jolas, a friend of James Joyce. The translation was not well received; in particular it was criticized for the way in which it rendered everyday working-class speech. A 2018 English translation by Michael Hofmann, published by New York Review Books, was given a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, which called it \\"vigorous and fresh\\" and a \\"welcome refurbishing of a masterpiece of literary modernism\\".Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Döblin, Michael Hofmann, Kirkus Reviews According to Oliver Kamm, \\"Dialogue is the most difficult thing to get right in translation\\" which Hofmann has rendered \\"in cockney dialect. It reads fluently, even at the risk of being possibly obscure to a non-British audience\\". Film adaptations Alexanderplatz in 1928 The novel has been adapted three times for film. In 1931 Berlin- Alexanderplatz was directed by Piel Jutzi. Döblin worked on the adaptation, along with Karlheinz Martin and Hans Wilhelm. The film starred Heinrich George, Maria Bard, Margarete Schlegel, Bernhard Minetti, Gerhard Bienert, Albert Florath and Paul Westermeier. The second adaptation, Berlin Alexanderplatz was directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Produced for and shown on German television in 1980 as a 14-part miniseries, it has also been shown theatrically. It runs for 15½ hours. Upon its release in New York City, ticket holders were required to come to the theatre for three consecutive nights to see the entire film. Both films were released in November 2007 by the Criterion Collection in the US in a multi-disc DVD set. A Region 2 edition of the Fassbinder version was released in the UK by Second Sight in October that year. Burhan Qurbani directed the most recent film adaptation, Berlin Alexanderplatz, which premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival in 2020. Qurbani's version recontextualized the lead role of Franz as Francis, an Afro-German refugee from Guinea-Bissau.

They are concentrated, highly aromatic, oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils are produced by distillation, boiling or pressing, absolutes are produced through solvent extraction, or more traditionally, through enfleurage.  Production  First, plant material is extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane, to yield a concrete. The concrete is then extracted with ethanol. The ethanol extract is cooled (e.g., to −15 °C) to solidify waxes, and cold filtered to yield a liquid extract. When the ethanol evaporates, an oil—the absolute—is left behind. Traditionally, the absolute was obtained by enfleurage, where the resulting pommade was extracted with ethanol to yield the absolute. Character and use Some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through solvent extraction. Examples of these are jasmine and beeswax. Absolutes in demand include rose, jasmine, tuberose, jonquil, ylang-ylang, mimosa, boronia, lavender, lavandin, geranium, clary sage, violet, oak moss, tonka bean. Rose oil, jasmine absolute, tuberose absolute, orris root oil, ambrette seeds oil, angelica root oil, and orange flower oil are valuable and expensive fragrance and flavor ingredients. Residual solvents may remain in the absolutes. Therefore, some absolutes are considered undesirable for aromatherapy.

First flown in 1952, the Tu-95 entered service with the Soviet Union in 1956 and is expected to serve the Russian Aerospace Forces until at least 2040. A development of the bomber for maritime patrol is designated Tu-142, while a passenger airliner derivative was called Tu-114. The aircraft has four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines with contra-rotating propellers. It is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today. The Tu-95 is one of the loudest military aircraft, particularly because the tips of the propeller blades move faster than the speed of sound. Its distinctive swept-back wings are set at an angle of 35°. The Tu-95 is unique as a propeller-driven aircraft with swept wings that has been built in large numbers.  Design and development  A Tu-95MS. A Tu-95 showing its swept wing and anti-shock bodies The design bureau, led by Andrei Tupolev, designed the Soviet Union's first intercontinental bomber, the 1949 Tu-85, a scaled-up version of the Tu-4, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress copy. A new requirement was issued to both Tupolev and Myasishchev design bureaus in 1950: the proposed bomber had to have an un- refueled range of 8,000 km (4,970 mi)—far enough to threaten key targets in the United States. Other goals included the ability to carry an 11,000 kg (24,200 pounds) load over the target. Tupolev was faced with selecting a suitable type of powerplant: the Tu-4 showed that piston engines were not powerful enough for such a large aircraft, and the AM-3 jet engines for the proposed T-4 intercontinental jet bomber used too much fuel to give the required range. Turboprop engines were more powerful than piston engines and gave better range than the turbojets available at the time, and gave a top speed between the two. Turboprops were also initially selected for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress to meet its long range requirement,https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059171325;view=1up;seq=3 p.40 and for the British long-range transport aircraft, the Saunders-Roe Princess, the Bristol Brabazon and the Bristol Britannia. Tupolev proposed a turboprop installation and Tu-95 design with this configuration was officially approved by the government on 11 July 1951. It used four Kuznetsov coupled turboprops, each fitted with two contra-rotating propellers with four blades each, with a nominal 8,948 kW (12,000 effective shaft horse power [eshp]) power rating. The engine, advanced for its time, was designed by a German team of ex-Junkers prisoner-engineers under Ferdinand Brandner. The fuselage was conventional with a mid-mounted wing with 35 degrees of sweep, an angle which ensured that the main wing spar passed through the fuselage in front of the bomb bay. Retractable tricycle landing gear was fitted, with all three gear strut units retracting rearwards, with the main gear units retracting rearwards into extensions of the inner engine nacelles. The Tu-95/I, with 2TV-2F engines, first flew in November 1952 with test pilot Alexey Perelet at the controls. After six months of test flights this aircraft suffered a propeller gearbox failure and crashed, killing Perelet. The second aircraft, Tu-95/II used four 12,000 eshp Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops which proved more reliable than the coupled 2TV-2F. After a successful flight testing phase, series production of the Tu-95 started in January 1956.

While this was the original Soviet Air Force designation for the aircraft, by the time it was being supplied to operational units it was already better known under the Tu-95 designation used internally by Tupolev, and the Tu-20 designation quickly fell out of use in the USSR. Since the Tu-20 designation was used on many documents acquired by U.S. intelligence agents, the name continued to be used outside the Soviet Union. Initially, the United States Department of Defense evaluated the Tu-95 as having a maximum speed of 644 km/h (400 mph) with a range of 12,500 km (7,800 mi).\\"Tu-20/95/142 Bear: The fastest prop-driven aircraft.\\" Aviation.ru. Retrieved: 5 June 2010. These numbers had to be revised upward numerous times. Like its American counterpart, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, the Tu-95 has continued to operate in the Russian Air Force while several subsequent iterations of bomber design have come and gone. Part of the reason for this longevity was its suitability, like the B-52, for modification to different missions. Whereas the Tu-95 was originally intended to drop free-falling nuclear weapons, it was subsequently modified to perform a wide range of roles, such as the deployment of cruise missiles, maritime patrol (Tu-142), and even civilian airliner (Tu-114). An AWACS platform (Tu-126) was developed from the Tu-114. An icon of the Cold War, the Tu-95 has served, not only as a weapons platform, but as a symbol of Soviet and later Russian national prestige. Russia's air force has received the first examples of a number of modernised strategic bombers in Tu-95MSs following upgrade work. Enhancements have been confined to the bomber's electronic weapons and targeting systems. Modernization of the first batch was completed in March 2020.http://www.airrecognition.com/index.php/news/defense-aviation- news/2020/march/6111-tupolev-completes-upgrade-of-tu-95ms-strategic- bombers.html = Tu-116 = A Tu-116 preserved at Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum. Designed as a stopgap in case the Tu-114A was not finished on time, two Tu-95 bombers were fitted with passenger compartments. Both aircraft had the same layout: office space, a passenger cabin consisting of 2 sections which could each accommodate 20 people in VIP seating, and the rest of the 70 m³ cabin configured as a normal airliner. Both aircraft were eventually used as crew ferries by the various Tu-95 squadrons. One of these machines is preserved at Ulyanovsk Central Airport. = Modernization = Currently, ongoing modernization of the Russia's Tu-95MS bombers is aimed primarily on the aircraft armament, namely adaptation of the new Kh-101/102 stealth cruise missile. The modernization includes installation of four underwing pylons for up to 8 Kh-101/102 cruise missiles as well as adjusting aircraft's main weapons bay for cruise missiles of size the Kh-101/102 (7.5 meters). Besides, the modernized Tu-95MS aircraft use radio-radar equipment and target- acquiring/navigation system based on GLONASS. The first Tu-95 modernized to carry the Kh-101/102 missiles was the Tu-95MS Saratov, rolled out at the Beriev aircraft plant in Taganrog in early 2015. It was transferred to the Russian Air Force in March 2015. Since 2015, the serial modernization is carried out also by the Aviakor aircraft plant in Samara at a rate of three aircraft per year. The first Tu-95 modernized by the Aviakor was the Tu-95MS Dubna, transferred to the Russian Air Force on 18 November 2015. In the future, Tu-95MSs are to be upgraded also with the new Kuznetsov NK-12MPM turboprop engines for increased flight range, combat load and reduced noise and vibrations and with the SVP-24 sighting and computing system from the Russian company Gefest & T. More complex modernization of the Tu-95MS16 bombers, known as \\"Tu-95MSM\\", is currently under development by Tupolev under a contract issued by the Russian Defence Ministry on 23 December 2009. This modernization is to include installation of the new Novella-NV1.021 radar, instead of the current Obzor-MS, installation of the SOI-021 information display system and the Meteor-NM2 airborne defense complex. In addition, the aircraft modernized to the \\"MSM\\" variant will be equipped with the upgraded Kuznetsov NK-12MPM turboprop engines. A contract for first modernized aircraft was signed in February 2018 with first flight scheduled for end of 2019. The first Tu95 MSM made its maiden flight on 22 August 2020.  Operational history  = Soviet Union = The Tu-95RT variant in particular was a veritable icon of the Cold War as it performed a maritime surveillance and targeting mission for other aircraft, surface ships and submarines. It was identifiable by a large bulge under the fuselage, which reportedly housed a radar antenna that was used to search for and detect surface ships. A series of nuclear surface tests were carried out by the Soviet Union in the early to mid 1960s. On October 30, 1961 a modified Tu-95 carried and dropped the AN602 device named Tsar Bomba, which was the most powerful thermonuclear device ever detonated.\\" Big Ivan, The Tsar Bomba (\\"King of Bombs\\"): The World's Largest Nuclear Weapon.\\" nuclearweaponarchive.org, 3 September 2007. Retrieved: 5 June 2010. Video footage of that particular test exists since the event was filmed for documentation purposes. The footage shows the specially adapted Tu-95V plane – painted with anti-flash white on its ventral surfaces – taking off carrying the bomb, in-flight scenes of the interior and exterior of the aircraft, and the detonation. The bomb was attached underneath the aircraft, which carried the weapon semi-externally since it could not be carried inside a standard Tu-95's bomb-bay, similar to the way the B.1 Special version of the Avro Lancaster did with the ten-tonne Grand Slam \\"earthquake bomb\\". Along with the Tsar Bomba, the Tu-95 proved to be a versatile bomber that would deliver the RDS-4 Tatyana (a fission bomb with a yield of forty-two kilotons), RDS-6S thermonuclear bomb, the RDS-37 2.9-megaton thermonuclear bomb, and the RP-30-32 200-kiloton bomb. The early versions of this bomber lacked comfort for their crews. They had a dank and dingy interior, and there was neither a toilet nor a galley in the aircraft. Though the living conditions on the bomber were unsatisfactory, the crews would often take two 10-hour mission trips a week to ensure combat readiness. This gave an annual total of around 1,200 flight hours. The bomber had the best crews available due to the nature of their mission. They would undertake frequent missions into the Arctic to practice transpolar strikes against the United States. Unlike their American counterparts, they never flew their missions carrying nuclear weapons. This hindered their mission readiness due to the fact that live ammunition had to come from special bunkers on the bases and loaded into the aircraft from the servicing trench below the bomb bay, a process that could take two hours. = Russia = RAF Typhoon In 1992, newly independent Kazakhstan began returning the Tu-95 aircraft of the 79th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division at Dolon air base to the Russian Federation.\\"All Strategic Bombers Out Of Kazakhstan; Talks On Those In Ukraine.\\" RFE/RL News Briefs, Vol. 3, No. 9, 21–25 February 1994, via Nuclear Threat Initiative.

Retrieved: 5 June 2010. In July 2010, two Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers set a world record for a non-stop flight for an aircraft in the class, when they spent more than 43 hours in the air. The bombers flew through the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans and the Sea of Japan, covering in total more than 30,000 km with four mid-air refuelings. The main task was to check the performance of the aircraft during such a long flight, in particular monitoring the engines and other systems. On 17 November 2015, Tu-95s had their combat debut, being employed for the first time in long-range airstrikes as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. On 17 November 2016, modernized Tu-95MS strategic bombers performed their first combat deployment, launching the Kh-101 cruise missiles on several militant positions in Syria. On 5 December 2017, two Tu-95MS strategic bombers and two Il-76MD transport aircraft landed for the first time at the Biak Air Base in Indonesia. The bombers covered more than 7,000 km with mid-air refueling before landing at the air base. During the course of their visit, the Tu-95's crews conducted their first patrol flights over the southern Pacific, staying airborne for more than eight hours.

It was discovered in 1984 by Colin Richards. Excavations were conducted between 1986 and 1991, over time revealing the base courses of at least 15 houses. The houses have similarities to those of the early phase of the better-known settlement at Skara Brae in that they have central hearths, beds built against the walls and stone dressers, and internal drains, but differ in that the houses seem to have been free-standing. The settlement dates back to circa 3000 BC. Pottery of the grooved ware type was found, as at the Stones of Stenness and Skara Brae. Flint and stone tools were found, as well as a piece of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran. The largest of the original buildings was House 2. It was double-sized, featuring a higher building standard than the other houses and unlike the others (rebuilt up to five times) seems to have remained in use throughout the inhabited period of the settlement. The houses were clustered around a central open area which was divided into areas for making pottery and the working of flint, bones and hides. Evidence suggests that Barnhouse was abandoned around 2600 BC. After Barnhouse ceased to be occupied, another structure was added, partially on top of the earlier building plans. This building (known as Structure 8) had a room about 7 m (23 ft) square with walls 3 m (10 ft) thick and an entrance facing towards the north west so that the midsummer sunset shines along the passageway, with similarities to some chambered cairns. The structure was surrounded by a clay platform. The entrance through this was aligned with Maeshowe. The structure is assumed to have served as a ceremonial site rather than as a dwelling. It is thought to be closely linked with the nearby Stones of Stenness. Some of the hearth slabs from the structure may have been moved to the Stones. This site is accessible to the public via a footpath from the Standing Stones of Stenness.

Biography Guimarães Rosa was born in Cordisburgo in the state of Minas Gerais, the first of six children of Florduardo Pinto Rosa (nicknamed \\"seu Fulô\\") and Francisca Guimarães Rosa (\\"Chiquitinha\\"). He was self-taught in many areas and studied several languages from childhood, starting with French before he was seven years old.GUIMARÃES ROSA: ĈU ESPERANTISTO? Entrevista: João Guimarães Rosa, por Lenice Guimarães de Paula Pitanguy (in Portuguese) He later recalled, Still a child, he moved to his grandparents' house in Belo Horizonte, where he finished primary school. He began his secondary schooling at the Santo Antônio School in São João del Rei, but soon returned to Belo Horizonte, where he graduated. In 1925, at only 16, he enrolled in the College of Medicine of Federal University of Minas Gerais. On June 27, 1930, he married Lígia Cabral Penna, a sixteen-year-old girl, with whom he was to have two daughters, Vilma and Agnes. In that same year, he graduated and began his medical practice in Itaguara, where he stayed for nearly two years. In this town, Rosa had his first contact with elements from the sertão. With the break of the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, Guimarães Rosa served as a volunteer doctor of the Public Force (Força Pública) heading to the so-called Tunel sector in Passa-Quatro, Minas Gerais, where he came into contact with the future president Juscelino Kubitschek, at that time the chief doctor of the Blood Hospital (Hospital de Sangue). Later on, he became a civil servant through examination. In 1933, he went to Barbacena in the position of Doctor of the 9th Infantry Battalion. Rosa later recalled that the experiences from his time as a doctor and a soldier were significant for his formation as a writer. Guimarães Rosa during his 1952 travels through the sertão. In the following year, Rosa began his diplomatic career. In 1938, he served as assistant-consul in Hamburg, Germany, where he met his future second wife, Aracy de Carvalho Guimarães Rosa, the only Brazilian woman to be officially granted the title of Righteous among the nations for her assistance to Jews escaping the Third Reich. In 1963, he was chosen by unanimous vote to enter the Brazilian Academy of Letters (Academia Brasileira de Letras) in his second candidacy. After postponing his acceptance for four years, he finally assumed his position in 1967, just three days before passing away in the city of Rio de Janeiro, victim of a heart attack, at the summit of his diplomatic and literary career. Work =Sagarana= Although Guimarães Rosa began to write with poetry, his only volume of verse, “Magma”, was relinquished by the author and was only published posthumously. In turn, Rosa began pursuing a literary career by inscribing a collection of twelve short-novels in a contest, in 1938, whose jury was chaired by the then already prestigious Graciliano Ramos. The older writer denied him the first prize. Ramos himself later explained his devaluation of the first drafts of a work later known as Sagarana: in spite of the author's talent and the many beauties of the collection, he thought that the uneven quality of the stories and their often exaggeratedly long passages resulted in a work that was incoherent and immature.Ramos, Graciliano. \\"Conversa de Bastidor\\". http://blog.opovo.com.br/pliniobortolotti/graciliano-ramos-o-editor-de- guimaraes-rosa/ Guimarães Rosa extenuously reviewed his work, until finally considering it ready for publication only in 1946. In its mature form, already noticeable in Sagarana, Rosa's style vastly differs from that of Ramos. The latter's succinct, dry expression is in harsh contrast with the former's exuberance of detail and quality of language, rich in vocabulary and adventurous in its exploration of the grammar of the Portuguese language, qualities the Ramos himself would endow as his fellow writer's greatest virtues. “Sagarana” is a portmanteau word crafted from the union of “saga” (homonym in Portuguese for saga) and “rana” (Tupi for “in the manner of”), thus translating as “(stories) in the manner of folk legends”. The book is composed of nine short-novels, three less than the original version submitted to the contest eight years earlier. All of these find their setting in the sertão and nearly all revolve around the figure of the jagunço, a mercenary- like figure that serves as a militia to farmers and secures the order in the Brazilian backlands. Rosa, however, would craft this outlaw manner of living to a type of existential condition according to which bravery and faith are the two driving forces of life. Antonio Candido related this treatment to a view of the jagunço that was inspired by the medieval knights and their values. Rosa brings to his narratives the regional aspects of the sertão. His use of language closely follows the dialect of the sertanejos – inhabitants of the sertão–, employing regional terms and variations of words, as well as borrowing their traditions and customs. Furthermore, he takes advantage of the geography and the wildlife of the sertão to structure the stories. Vivid descriptions of landscapes (most notably in the short-novel São Marcos, “Saint Mark”, where mystical lore of popular witchcraft and the vividness of nature are blended together) and animals, especially bird flocks and groups of cattle, populate the pages of the book, not only in an attempt to capture the backdrop of the geographic sertão, but also in close correspondence with the plot of the stories and as an extended metaphor for the solitude of man and his pursuit of transcendence. This is not, however, limited to the content of his stories. The noted narrative O Burrinho Pedrês (\\"The Brindled Donkey\\"), for example, contains anthological passages where Rosa intensely manipulates the sonority of the sentences, whether mimicking the metric of the traditional verse-form of the popular songs of the sertão or employing onomatopoeia and alliteration and juxtaposing several words that relate to the field of cattle breeding to textually recreate the sounds of the passing herds. Rosa would sustain and develop these characteristics through his later work. The most prestigious of these stories is the last, A Hora e Vez de Augusto Matraga (“The Time and Turn of Augusto Matraga”), referred to by Rosa as a sort of “key\\" to the collection Rosa, João Guimarães. Carta a João Condé. In: \\"Sagarana\\". São Paulo: Nova Fronteira, 2015. The hagiography of a worldly man, it recounts the redemption of a wealthy farm-owner named Augusto Esteves, or Nhô Augusto, a vicious person likened to all sorts of debauchery, who is betrayed and beat to nearly death, being finally left stranded in the deserted backlands and marked with a branding iron. Two old sertanejos rescue him and give him cares in their house; during his convalescence, a priest administers blessings to him and promises the violated man that all persons are intended to a particular and decisive moment of salvation. Once cured, he proclaims his wish to go to heaven \\"nem que seja a porrete\\" (\\"even though by a cudgel\\"), and engages vigorously in farm working and good deeds and finds the companionship and friendliness of the jagunço leader Seu Joaõzinho Bem-Bem, who, reckoning the man's vocation to arms, invites him to his group, an offer which Nhô Augusto refuses in order to comply with his whish of ascending towards God. Rosa later describes a scene where the explendour of nature is revealed to him through the bright colors of the flowers and the liberty of the birds. Affected by this revelation, Augusto departs to wander through the sertão in search of his “time and turn”. His demand only finds completion through a fight to death with the very leader of jagunços he once befriended. It is through a violent insurgence against what he sees as an unjust deed performed by the jagunços that Nhô Angusto ascends to a saint-like contention. =Corpo de Baile= Guimarães Rosa next book was Corpo de Baile (roughly, \\"Corps de Ballet\\"), published then years later, in 1956. For the second edition, the collection was divided into three parts, now usually published separatedly: Noites do Sertão (“Nights of the Sertão”); Manuelzão e Miguelim (a play on words with the names of two characters from the stories, using Portuguese augmentative and diminutive suffixes, translating reasonably as “Big Manuel and Little Miguel”); and, “No Urubuquaquá, no Pinhém” (“In the Urubuquaquá, in the Pinhém”, the names being locations in the stories). Such policy of publication, although authorized by the author himself, breaks the original structure of the book, whose complexity is often remarked. The very name of the collection points to this fact: the \\"corps de ballet\\" it refers to are the conjunction of symbols and ideias that figure repeatedly across the seven short-novels, reappearing here and there in this or that manner in order to gain yet another level of meaning. This \\"dancing\\" of motifs and metaphors takes place inside and outside of the stories. Among them, Rosa notably elects figures from astrology to compose and ordinate the plots and the relations between themselves, crafting a book-long sequence of a single meaning. Such progress is mimicked by the story Recado do Morro (\\"Message from the Hills\\"), which, accordingly, occupied the middle of the book, being the fourth story in the original publication. This interpretation was verbally presented by the critic José Miguel Wisnik in his presentation during the “Infinitamente Rosa” event in September 14, 2016 at the University of São Paulo. Recado do Morro is also significant in its treatment of the ideia of a language of the sertão itself. In the story, a group of five sertanejos is escorting a German naturalist in an expedition through the state of Minas Gerais. Parallel to their own discovery of the sertão, another journey is recounted, following step by step the march of the travelers: that of a message given by the very backlands that is spread unpretensiously, much in the manner of an anecdote, by the marginal members of the region's society. First heard from a hill by a madman who lives in the caves of the backlands, he recounts the message to his brother, an impoverished traveler, who, by his turns, tells the message to a child. /The child proceedes to tell the message to a travel guide, the guide to a prophetic hermit, who takes it to be a sign of the Revelation and lavishly repeats the message to a city's congregation; it is then heard by a neurotic man who, finally, recounts it to the poet and singer Laudelim. Each time the message is told, its conveyors slightly alter its contents, until the poet ultimately gives it the form a mythical ballad, which he sings at a party attended by the expedition members. Only then it becomes clear that the message all along was a warning to their leader, Pedro Orósio. Pedro, a handsome and viril man, is altogether hated for the relations he maintains with the wives of the other sertanejos. The men who he has fooled intended to have their revenge by letting him drunk and subsequently murdering him. Upon listening to the ballad, Pedro Orósio understands its hermetic symbolism to refer to himself and his pretentious men, which proves to be correct, and he is capable of saving his life after being warned by the \\"message of the hill\\". One can see here an illustration by Guimarães Rosa of how he himself understood his writing. Rosa intervenes the descriptions of the landscapes found by the German man's expedition with the successive versions of the story that the madmen, the child and finally the poet retell. Thus, he describes how a certain knowledge presented in nature is capture and mysteriously understood by those naïve or lunatic figures – something which is further established in Campo Geral – and becomes comprehensible through a poetic treatment, while accompanying a scientific discovery of the sertão, a discovery that is incapable of revealing the true secrecies it uncovers. =Grande Sertão: Veredas= Rosa published his masterpiece, Grande Sertão: Veredas (literally, “Great Sertão: Tracks”, but translated as The Devil to Pay in the Backlands, to Guimarães Rosa's disapproval See a letter from Rosa to Edoardo Bizzarri, his Italian translator, commenting the foreign titles of his works in: ‘’João Guimarães Rosa: correspondência com seu tradutor italiano, Edoardo Bizzarri’’, Editora UFMG, 2003.) in the same year. His sole novel, the book began as yet another short-novel that he continuously expanded and is written in the form of a monologue by the jagunço Riobaldo, who details his life to an educated listener, whose identity, while unknown, defines him as an urban man. Riobaldo mixes the wars of the jagunços, which form the most straightforward part of the novel's plot, with his musings on life, the existence of God and the Devil – his greatest concern –, the nature of human feelings and the passage of time and memory, as well as several short anecdotes, often allegories illustrating a point raised in his narrative. The book can be seen, as it was by the author, as an adaptation of the faustian motif to the sertão. Riobaldo's account frequently returns to the central topic of his discourse, which he proclaims as the reason for his telling his life-story, as he expects, albeit ironically so, an answer from his listener: whether or not the Devil, and therefore evil, exists. Riobaldo is anguished by the idea he may have conducted a pact with the Devil, although he is uncertain, and he often dismisses the superstitions and beliefs of the \\"sertanejos\\" as stupidities. The interpretation of this supposed pact vary widely. Antonio Candido viewed it as an act of self-assurance, a symbolic deed by which Riobaldo can take hold of himself and of all his potential, something which allows him to become a powerful warrior who can extend vastly the power of his gang and avenge the betrayal of Joca Ramiro. In this, Candido insists, the pact is analogous to the initiation rites of the chivalric romances, through which the wan childe becomes a worthy knight. Willi Bolle, on the other hand, in a materialistic view of the book, which he considers to demonstrate the formation of the social order in the sertão, sees the pact as an attempt by Riobaldo to socially ascend from his condition of a poor jagunço to the upper class of the rich farmers, an ascension which is the actual conclusion of the book. All this is conducted by the motif of the star-crossed love affair. Riobaldo is torn between two contrasting loves: Diadorim, another jagunço, to whom he refers as a “demoniac love”, and Otacília, an ordinary beauty from the backlands, a godly love for times of peace. He has the company of Diadorim for most of his life, though their love remains unconsummated, but unites with Otacília only once his days as a jagunço are over and behind. A vereda with a buriti tree at the Grande: Sertão Veredas National Park in Brazil. The Park was created in 1989 in Formoso, Minas Gerais, in order to protect the environment The matter of the Diadorim's identity is highly problematic. Though a woman, Diadorim passes off as a man, under the name of Reinaldo, to enter the male-exclusive world of the jagunços. Her true gender is only revealed to Riobaldo after her death. This points to a frequent theme of Riobaldo's mussings: the inconstancy of things. According to Walnice Galvão, Riobaldo seems to reason that nothing ever is nor remains, but inside everything is its potential negation, which might easily suppress its anterior positive form. This fact is recounted several times by Riobaldo, often in sensorial metaphors, such as his description of poisonous rocks lying in the bottom of a clear river, or the stories he recounts of good men becoming vile and vile men becoming good. To her, the pact must be seen, in accordance with his perception, as an agreement with evil that results in great accomplishments and personal growth and a subsequent approximation towards God. Furthermore, the novel might be seen as an attempt of memory, and therefore his speech, to retrieve that which has been irrevocably lost and attach personal meaning to it. Reality, therefore, becomes only a linguistic construction, made possible by the interaction of two persons. The novel closes with the sentence: “Travessia. O homem humano.” (“Crossing. The human human-being.”) followed by the symbol of infinity, a nod to the never-ending extension of life and its retelling. =Later works= Grande Sertão: Veredas was followed by Primeiras Estórias (“First Stories”), a collection of twenty- one short-stories, published in 1962. Very famous among these is A Terceira Margem do Rio (lit., “The Third Bank of the River”) made into a film of the same name and the inspiration behind a homonymous song by Caetano Veloso. The story, addressing the themes peculiar to Rosa's oeuvre and told in first person from the point of view of an observer, recounts the absurd event of a man who decides to live inside a boat in the middle of a water stream, giving no explanation for his actions nor achieving, apparently, anything with it. His last collection published in life was Tutameia – Terceiras Estórias (“Tutameia – Third Stories”), “tuttameia” being a neologism that breaks up as “butterfly’s skeleton”, roughly meaning “ninharia”, or \\"something of low value\\". Two posthumous works followed: Estas Estórias (“These Stories”), another collection of short-novels, and ‘’Ave, Palavra’’ (a pun on the double- meaning of the word “ave”, which signifies both bird and an archaic salutation, being translated literally as “Bird, Word” or “Hail, Word”), a work of miscellany, compromising short-stories, poems, journal entries and travel notations.

Magazines can be removable (detachable) or integral (internal/fixed) to the firearm. The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored within it into a position where they may be readily loaded into the barrel chamber by the action of the firearm. The detachable magazine is often colloquially referred to as a clip, although this is technically inaccurate. Magazines come in many shapes and sizes, from tubular magazines on lever-action rifles that may hold several rounds, to detachable box and drum magazines for automatic rifles and machine guns that may hold more than one hundred rounds. Various jurisdictions ban what they define as \\"high-capacity magazines\\". Nomenclature With the increased use of semi-automatic and automatic firearms, the detachable magazine became increasingly common. Soon after the adoption of the M1911 pistol, the term \\"magazine\\" was settled on by the military and firearms experts, though the term \\"clip\\" is often used in its place (though only for detachable magazines, never fixed)., translated from the French edition, 1916 The defining difference between clips and magazines is the presence of a feed mechanism in a magazine, typically a spring-loaded follower, which a clip lacks. A magazine has four parts as follows; a spring, a spring follower, a body and a base. A clip may be made of one continuous piece of stamped metal and have no moving parts. Examples of clips are moon clips for revolvers; \\"stripper\\" clips such as what is used for military 5.56 ammo, in association with a speedloader; or the en bloc clip for M1 Garand rifles, among others. Use of the term \\"clip\\" to refer to detachable magazines is a point of strong disagreement. History The earliest firearms were loaded with loose powder and a lead ball, and to fire more than a single shot without reloading required multiple barrels, such as pepper-box guns and double-barreled shotguns, or multiple chambers, such as in revolvers. Both of these add bulk and weight over a single barrel and a single chamber, however, and many attempts were made to get multiple shots from a single loading of a single barrel through the use of superposed loads. While some early repeaters such as the Kalthoff repeater managed to operate using complex systems with multiple feed sources for ball, powder and primer, easily mass-produced repeating mechanisms did not appear until self-contained cartridges were developed. =First tubular= Loading sleeve open, three Henry Flat cartridges, compare with .44 WCF round Diagram of the Spencer rifle showing the tubular magazine in the butt The first successful mass-produced repeating rifle to use a \\"tubular magazine\\" permanently mounted to the weapon was the Austrian Army's Girandoni air rifle with a self contained tubular magazine to hold the ball bullets in 1779. The second mass-produced repeater was the Volcanic Rifle which used a hollow bullet with the base filled with powder and primer fed into the chamber from a tube called a \\"magazine\\" with an integral spring to push the cartridges in to the action, thence to be loaded into the chamber and fired. It was named after a building or room used to store ammunition. The anemic power of the Rocket Ball ammunition used in the Volcanic doomed it to limited popularity.. The Henry repeating rifle is a lever-action, breech-loading, tubular magazine fed rifle, and was an improved version of the earlier Volcanic rifle. Designed by Benjamin Tyler Henry in 1860, it was one of the first firearms to use self-contained metallic cartridges. The Henry was introduced in the early 1860s and produced through 1866 in the United States by the New Haven Arms Company. It was adopted in small quantities by the Union in the Civil War and favored for its greater firepower than the standard issue carbine. Many later found their way West and was famed both for its use at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and being the basis for the iconic Winchester rifle which are still made to this day. The Henry and Winchester rifles would go on to see service with a number of militaries including Turkey. Switzerland and Italy adopted similar designs. The second magazine-fed firearm to achieve widespread success was the Spencer repeating rifle, which saw service in the American Civil War. The Spencer used a tubular magazine located in the butt of the gun instead of under the barrel and it used new rimfire metallic cartridges. The Spencer was successful, but the rimfire ammunition did occasionally ignite in the magazine tube and destroy the magazine. It could also injure the user. The new bolt-action rifles began to gain favor with militaries in the 1880s and were often equipped with tubular magazines. The Mauser Model 1871 was originally a single-shot action that added a tubular magazine in its 1884 update. The Norwegian Jarmann M1884 was adopted in 1884 and also used a tubular magazine. The French Lebel Model 1886 rifle also used 8-round tubular magazine.Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, p.179-180 =Integral box= thumb 1905 Military Rifles magazines. 1 & 2: Mosin–Nagant 3 & 4: Lebel 5 & 6: Gewehr 1888 7 & 8: Mannlicher M1888 9 & 10: Lee–Metford 11 & 12: Dutch-Mannlicher M1895 13 & 14: Mauser M1893 15: Krag–Jørgensen 16: Schmidt–Rubin M1889 The military cartridge was evolving as the magazine rifle evolved. Cartridges evolved from large-bore cartridges (.40 caliber/10 mm and larger) to smaller bores that fired lighter, higher-velocity bullets and incorporated new smokeless propellants. The Lebel Model 1886 rifle was the first rifle and cartridge to be designed for use with smokeless powder and used an 8 mm wadcutter-shaped bullet that was drawn from a tubular magazine. This would later become a problem when the Lebel's ammunition was updated to use a more aerodynamic pointed bullet. Modifications had to be made to the centerfire case to prevent the spitzer point from igniting the primer of the next cartridge inline in the magazine through recoil or simply rough handling. This remains a concern with lever-action firearms today. Two early box magazine patents were the ones by Rollin White in 1855 and William Harding in 1859. A detachable box magazine was patented in 1864 by the American Robert Wilson. Unlike later box magazines this magazine fed into a tube magazine and was located in the stock of the gun.Jaroslav Lugs. A complete review of firearm systems and their histories. Another box magazine, closer to the modern type, was patented in Britain (No. 483) by Mowbray Walker, George Henry Money and Francis Little in 1867. James Paris Lee patented a box magazine which held rounds stacked vertically in 1879 and 1882 and it was first adopted by Austria in the form of an 11mm straight-pull bolt-action rifle, the Mannlicher M1886. It also used a cartridge clip which held 5 rounds ready to load into the magazine., entry for Rifle En bloc clip and 8mm ammo for the Gewehr 88 Swedish Mauser stripper clip loaded with Swedish 6.5×55mm The bolt- action Krag–Jørgensen rifle, designed in Norway in 1886, used a unique rotary magazine that was built into the receiver. Like Lee's box magazine, the rotary magazine held the rounds side-by-side, rather than end-to-end. Like most rotary magazines, it was loaded through a loading gate one round at a time, this one located on the side of the receiver. While reliable, the Krag–Jørgensen's magazine was expensive to produce and slow to reload. It was adopted by only three countries, Denmark in 1889, the United States in 1892, and Norway in 1894. Clip-fed revolution A clip (called chargers by the British) is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine or cylinder of a firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. Several different types of clips exist, most of which are made of inexpensive metal stampings that are designed to be disposable, though they are often re-used. In 1888 the Germans developed the Model 1888 Commission Rifle with a 5-round en bloc clip-fed internal box magazine.Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, p.184 Mauser would continue to make improved models from 1889 through 1893 in various calibers were adopted by various militaries at this time. In 1890 the French adopted the 8mm Lebel Berthier rifles with 3-round internal magazines, fed from en bloc clips; the empty clips were pushed from the bottom of the action by the insertion of a loaded clip from the top.Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, p.180 In the late 1800s there were many short-lived designs, such as the M1895 Lee Navy and Gewehr 1888, eventually replaced by the M1903 Springfield rifle and Gewehr 98 respectively. The Russian Mosin–Nagant, adopted in 1891, was an exception. It was not revolutionary; it was a bolt-action rifle, used a small-bore smokeless powder cartridge, and a fixed box magazine loaded from the top with stripper clips, all of which were features that were used in earlier military rifles. What made the Nagant stand out was that it combined all the earlier features in a form that was to last virtually unchanged from its issue by Russia in 1894 through World War II and with its sniper rifle variants still in use today. Magazine cut-off An interesting feature of many late 19th- and early 20th-century bolt-action rifles was the magazine cut-off, sometimes called a feed interrupter. This was a mechanical device that prevented the rifle from loading a round from the magazine, requiring the shooter to manually load each individual round as he fired, saving the rounds in the magazine for short periods of rapid fire when ordered to use them. Most military authorities that specified them assumed that their riflemen would waste ammunition indiscriminately if allowed to load from the magazine all the time. By the middle of World War I, most manufacturers deleted this feature to save costs and manufacturing time; it is also likely that battlefield experience had proven the futility of this philosophy. Final fixed- magazine developments Comparison of M1 Garand en bloc clip (left), and SKS stripper clip (right) One of the last new clip-fed, fixed-magazine rifles widely adopted that was not a modification of an earlier rifle was the M1 Garand rifle. The first semi-automatic rifle that was issued in large numbers to the infantry, the Garand was fed by a special eight-round en bloc clip. The clip itself was inserted into the rifle's magazine during loading, where it was locked in place. The rounds were fed directly from the clip, with a spring-loaded follower in the rifle pushing the rounds up into feeding position. When empty, the bolt would lock open, and a spring would automatically eject the empty clip with a distinctive pinging sound, leaving the rifle ready to be reloaded. The M14 rifle, which was based on incremental changes to the Garand action, switched to a detachable box magazine. However, the M14 with magazine attached could also be loaded via 5-round stripper- clips. The Soviet SKS carbine, which entered service in 1945, was something of a stopgap between the semi-automatic service rifles being developed in the period leading up to World War II, and the new assault rifle developed by the Germans. The SKS used a fixed magazine, holding ten rounds and fed by a conventional stripper clip. It was a modification of the earlier AVS-36 rifle, shortened and chambered for the new reduced power 7.62×39mm cartridge. It was rendered obsolete for military use almost immediately by the 1947 introduction of the magazine-fed AK-47 assault rifle, though it remained in service for many years in Soviet Bloc nations alongside the AK-47. The detachable magazine quickly came to dominate post-war military rifle designs. =Detachable box magazines= M1 Garand 8-round en bloc clip, M14 20-round magazine, M16 STANAG 20- and 30-round magazines Firearms using detachable magazines are made with an opening known as a magazine well into which the detachable magazine is inserted. The magazine well locks the magazine in position for feeding cartridges into the chamber of the firearm, and requires a device known as a magazine release to allow the magazine to be separated from the firearm. The Lee–Metford rifle, developed in 1888, was one of the first rifles to use a detachable box magazine.Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000, by Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, p. 187 However, the first completely modern removable box magazine was patented in 1908 by Arthur Savage for the Savage Model 99., April 28, 1908, Improved Magazine, Inventor: Arthur W. Savage. Other guns did not adopt all of its features until his patent expired in 1942: It has shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle. It operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths. It is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. These features allow the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges in the field. The magazine is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. It also includes a crucial safety feature for hunting dangerous game: when empty the followerThe \\"follower\\" is the sheet metal part between the last cartridge and the spring. It might be made of or coated with other materials such as nylon or Teflon. stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator that the gun is empty before any attempt to fire. The first successful semi-automatic pistol was the Borchardt C-93 (1893) and incorporated detachable box magazines. Nearly all subsequent semiautomatic pistol designs adopted detachable box magazines. The Swiss Army evaluated the Luger pistol using a detachable box magazine in 7.65×21mm Parabellum and adopted it in 1900 as its standard sidearm. The Luger pistol was accepted by the Imperial German Navy in 1904. This version is known as Pistole 04. In 1908 the German Army adopted the Luger to replace the Reichsrevolver in front-line service. The Pistole 08 (or P.08) was chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The P.08 was the usual side arm for German Army personnel in both world wars. The M1911 semi-automatic pistol set the standard for most modern handguns and likewise the mechanics of the handgun magazine. In most handguns the magazine follower engages a slide-stop to hold the slide back and keep the firearm out of battery when the magazine is empty and all rounds fired. Upon inserting a loaded magazine, the user depresses the slide stop, throwing the slide forward, stripping a round from the top of the magazine stack and chambering it. In single-action pistols this action keeps the hammer cocked back as the new round is chambered, keeping the gun ready to begin firing again. During World War One, detachable box magazines found favor, being used in all manner of firearms, such as pistols, light-machine guns, submachine guns, semi- automatic and automatic rifles. However, after the War to End All Wars, military planners failed to recognize the importance of automatic rifles and detachable box magazine concept, and instead maintained their traditional views and preference for clip-fed bolt-action rifles. As a result, many promising new automatic rifle designs that used detachable box magazines were abandoned. As World War II loomed, most of the world's major powers began to develop submachine guns fed by 20- to 40-round detachable box magazines. However, of the major powers, only the United States would adopt a general- issue semi-automatic rifle that used detachable box magazines: the M1 Carbine with its 15-round magazines. As the war progressed the Germans would develop the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle concept with its 30-round detachable magazine. After WWII, automatic weapons using detachable box magazines would be developed and used by all of the world's armies. Today, detachable box magazines are the norm and they are so widely used that they are simply referred to as magazines or \\"mags\\" for short. Function and types SKS internal box magazine. Detachable box magazine for a SIG SG 550 with studs for stacking multiple magazines together. All cartridge-based single-barrel firearms designed to fire more than a single shot without reloading require some form of magazine designed to store and feed cartridges to the firearm's action. Magazines come in many shapes and sizes, with the most common type in modern firearms being the detachable box type. Most magazines designed for use with a reciprocating bolt firearm (tube fed firearms being the exception) make use of a set of feed lips which stop the vertical motion of the cartridges out of the magazine but allow one cartridge at a time to be pushed forward (stripped) out of the feed lips by the firearm's bolt into the chamber. Some form of spring and follower combination is almost always used to feed cartridges to the lips which can be located either in the magazine (most removable box magazines) or built into the firearm (fixed box magazines). There are also two distinct styles to feed lips. In a single-feed design the top cartridge touches both lips and is commonly used in single-column box magazines, while a double-feed magazine consists of a wider set of lips so that the second cartridge in line forces the top cartridge against one lip. This design has proven more resistant to jamming in use with double-column magazines.Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, London: Orbis Publishing Ltd. (1979), p. 33. Some magazine types are strongly associated with certain firearm types, such as the fixed \\"tubular\\" magazine found on most lever-action rifles and pump-action shotguns. A firearm using detachable magazines may accept a variety of types of magazine, such as the Thompson submachine gun, most variations of which would accept box or drum magazines. Some types of firearm, such as the M249 and other squad automatic weapons, can feed from both magazines and belts. =Tubular= Many of the first repeating rifles, particularly lever-action rifles, used magazines that stored cartridges nose- to-end inside of a spring-loaded tube typically running parallel under the barrel, or in the buttstock. Tubular magazines are also commonly used in pump- action shotguns and .22 caliber bolt-action rimfire rifles such as the Marlin Model XT. Tubular magazines and centerfire cartridges with pointed (spitzer) bullets present a safety issue: a pointed bullet may (through the forces of recoil or simply rough handling) strike the next round's primer and ignite that round, or even cause a chain ignition of other rounds, within the magazine. The Winchester '73 used blunt-nosed centerfire cartridges as the .44-40 Winchester. Certain modern rifle cartridges using soft pointed plastic tips have been designed to avoid this problem while improving the aerodynamic qualities of the bullet to match those available in bolt-action designs, thus extending the effective range of lever-actions. =Box= The most popular type of magazine in modern rifles and handguns, a box magazine stores cartridges in a column, either one above the other or in staggered zigzag fashion. This zigzag stack is often identified as a double-column or double- stack (The double-stack is much more common because of its ability to store more rounds), since a single staggered column is actually two side-by-side vertical columns offset by half of the diameter of a round. As the firearm cycles, cartridges are moved to the top of the magazine by a follower driven by spring compression to either a single-feed position or side-by-side feed positions. Box magazines may be integral to the firearm or removable. * An internal box, integral box or fixed magazine (also known as a blind box magazine when lacking a floorplate) is built into the firearm and is not easily removable. This type of magazine is found most often on bolt-action rifles. An internal box magazine is usually charged through the action, one round at a time. Military rifles often use stripper clips, a.k.a. chargers, permitting multiple rounds, commonly 5 or 10 at a time, to be loaded in rapid sequence. Some internal box magazines use en bloc clips that are loaded into the magazine with the ammunition and that are ejected from the firearm when empty. * A detachable box magazine is a self-contained mechanism capable of being loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver, usually below the action (BAR, MP 40, AK 47, M16) but occasionally to the side (Sten, FG 42, Johnson LMG, Sterling, M249) or on top (Madsen machine gun, Bren gun, Owen gun, P90). When necessary, the magazine can easily be detached from the firearm and replaced by another. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case. Detachable box magazines may be metal or plastic. The plastic magazines are sometimes partially transparent so the operator can easily check the remaining ammunition. Box magazines are often affixed to each other with clamps, clips, tape, straps, or built-in studs to facilitate faster reloading: see jungle style. There are, however, exceptions to these rules. The Lee–Enfield rifle had a detachable box magazine only to facilitate cleaning. The Lee–Enfield magazine did open, permitting rapid unloading of the magazine without having to operate the bolt-action repeatedly to unload the magazine. Others, like the Breda Modello 30, had a fixed protruding magazine that resembled a conventional detachable box but was non- detachable. Horizontal The FN P90 personal defense weapon uses a horizontally mounted feeding system; the magazine sits parallel to the barrel, fitting flush with the top of the receiver, and the ammunition is rotated 90 degrees by a spiral feed ramp before being chambered. The AR-57, also known as the AR Five-seven, is an upper receiver for the AR-15/M16 rifle lower receiver, firing FN 5.7×28mm rounds from standard FN P90 magazines. Casket Diagram of the Spectre M4 casket magazine. Another form of box magazine, sometimes referred to as a \\"quad-column\\", can hold a great amount of ammunition. It is wider than a standard magazine, but retains the same length. Casket magazines can be found on the Suomi KP/-31, Hafdasa C-4, Spectre M4, QCW-05 and on 5.45×39mm AK rifle derivatives. Magpul has been granted a patent for a STANAG-compatible casket magazine, and such a magazine was also debuted by SureFire in December 2010, and is now sold as the MAG5-60 and MAG5-100 High Capacity Magazine (HCM) in 60- and 100-round capacities, respectively, in 5.56mm for AR-15 compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept STANAG 4179 magazines. Izhmash has also developed a casket magazine for the AK-12. =Rotary= Ruger 10/22's BX-1CLR rotary magazine The rotary (or spool) magazine consists of a star-shaped sprocket actuated by a torsion spring. The magazine may be fixed or detachable. Cartridges fit between the teeth of the sprocket, which is mounted on a spindle parallel to the bore axis, with a torsion spring providing the torque necessary to rotate the rounds into the feeding position. Rotary magazines are usually of low capacity of ten or fewer rounds, depending on the cartridge used. John Smith patented a rotary magazine in 1856.https://patents.google.com/patent/US14034A/en Another rotary magazine was produced by Sylvester Roper in 1866 and was also used in the weapons by Anton Spitalsky and the Savage Model 1892., Magazine Gun, Application date: April 10, 1889, Issue date: July 25, 1893, Inventor: Arthur W. Savage The M1941 Johnson rifle also uses a rotary magazine. The design is still used in some modern firearms, most notably the Ruger American series, the semi-automatic Ruger 10/22, the bolt-action Ruger 77/22 and the Steyr SSG 69. =Drum= 50- and 100-round drum magazines plus 20- and 30-round box magazines for Thompson SMG Drum magazines are used primarily for light machine guns. In one type, a moving partition within a cylindrical chamber forces loose rounds into an exit slot, with the cartridges being stored parallel to the axis of rotation. After loading of the magazine, a wound spring or other mechanism forces the partition against the rounds. In all models a single staggered column is pushed by a follower through a curved path. From there the rounds enter the vertical riser either from a single or dual drums. Cylindrical designs such as rotary and drum magazines allow for larger capacity than box magazines, without growing to excessive length. The downside of a drum magazine's extra capacity is its added weight. Many drum-fed firearms can also load from conventional box magazines, such as the Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun, RPK light machine gun and the American Thompson submachine gun. The term \\"drum\\" is sometimes applied to a belt box for a belt- fed machine gun, though this is just a drum, not a drum magazine. Saddle- drum Beta C-Mag double-drum magazine. Before WWII the Germans developed 75-round saddle-drum magazines for use in their MG 13 and MG 15 machine guns. The MG 34 machine guns could also use saddle-drum magazine when fitted with a special feed cover. The 75 rounds of ammunition were evenly distributed in each side of the magazine with a central feed \\"tower\\" where the ammunition is fed to the bolt. The ammunition was fed by a spring force, with rounds alternating from each side of the double drum so that the gun would not become unbalanced. =Pan/Disc= Pan magazine as used on a 7.92mm Lewis Gun. Often referred to as a drum magazine, the pan magazine differs from other drum magazines in that the cartridges are stored perpendicular to the axis of rotation, rather than parallel, and are usually mounted on top of the firearm. This type is used on the Lewis Gun, Vickers K, Bren Gun (only used in anti- aircraft mountings), Degtyaryov light machine gun, and American-180 submachine gun. A highly unusual example was found on the Type 89 machine gun fed from two 45-round quadrant-shaped pan magazines (each magazine had a place for nine 5-round stripper clips). =Helical= Calico pioneered the helical magazine design. Pictured is the company's M960 carbine. Helical magazines extend the drum magazine design so that rounds follow a spiral path around an auger- shaped rotating follower or drive member, allowing for large ammunition capacity in a relatively compact package (compared to a regular box magazine of similar capacity). Early helical magazine designs include that patented by an unidentified inventor through the patent agent William Edward Newton in 1857 and the internal magazine of the Evans Repeating Rifle, patented in the late 1860s.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jc4dCe0_7g0C&pg;=RA11-PA1&dq;=Edward+Newton+1857+335&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjJnaC5sZPpAhU0RBUIHWK8DmEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q;=Edward%20Newton%201857%20335&f;=false This type of magazine is used by the Calico M960, Bizon SMG, CS/LS06 and KBP PP90M1. The North Korean military uses a 100- to 150- round helical magazine in the Type 88 assault rifle. Helical magazines offer substantially more ammunition carriage, however they are inherently complex designs. As such, they can be difficult to load and may decrease the reliability of feeding the weapon. STANAG magazine Two STANAG-compliant magazines: A 20-round Colt- manufactured magazine, and a 30-round Heckler & Koch \\"High Reliability\\" magazine. A STANAG magazineThe M16, Gordon L. Rottman, © Osprey Publishing, 2011, Page 35-36Future Weapons, Kevin Dockery, © Penguin, 2007, Page 125-126 or NATO magazine is a type of detachable magazine proposed by NATO in October 1980.Watters, Daniel: \\"The 5.56 X 45mm Timeline: A Chronology of Development \\", The Gun Zone, 2000–2007. Shortly after NATO's acceptance of the 5.56×45mm NATO rifle cartridge, Draft Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4179 was proposed in order to allow NATO members to easily share rifle ammunition and magazines down to the individual soldier level. The U.S. M16 rifle magazine was proposed for standardization. Many NATO members, but not all, subsequently developed or purchased rifles with the ability to accept this type of magazine. However, the standard was never ratified and remains a 'Draft STANAG'.\\"NATO Infantry Weapons Standardization \\", NDIA Conference 2008 The STANAG magazine concept is only an interface, dimensional, and control (magazine latch, bolt stop, etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines to be made in various configurations and capacities. The standard STANAG magazines are 20, 30, and 40 round box magazines, but there are many other designs available with capacities ranging from 1 round to 60 and 100 round casket magazines, 90 round snail-drum magazines, and 100 roundThe Gun Digest Book of the AR-15. Patrick Sweeney. Gun Digest Books, September 9, 2005. page 106 and 150 round double-drum magazines. High- capacity magazines In the United States, a number of states have passed laws that ban magazines which are defined as high-capacity by statute. High- capacity or large-capacity magazines are generally those defined by statute to be capable of holding more than 10 or 15 rounds, although the definitions vary. Other nations impose restrictions on magazine capacity as well. In Canada, magazines are generally limited to five rounds for rifles and 10 for handguns (with some exceptions), depending on the firearm.

Kingswear Castle is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet of ships of \\"Pre-eminent National Significance\\". History Rochester. The Kingswear Castle was built by Philip & Sons of Dartmouth in 1924 for service on the River Dart, following sister ships Compton Castle and Totnes Castle, and was operated by the River Dart Steamboat Co. Her predecessor of the same name from 1904 is now a rotted and barely recognisable hulk in the River Dart, but the engines were re-used in the current steamboat. Kingswear Castle was chartered to the United States Navy during World War II, and was used for carrying stores and personnel at Dartmouth. In 1965 Kingswear Castle was withdrawn from service and became the first purchase of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society (PSPS) two years later. She was then taken to the Isle of Wight and was moored at Island Harbour Marina from August 1967 to June 1971. However, due to her deteriorating condition, she was then taken to the River Medway. After various difficulties and a great deal of restoration work she was finally brought into service again in 1985, and was operated by the Paddle Steamer Kingswear Castle Trust based at Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent, in association with the PSPS. On 18 December 2012 she returned to the River Dart again, under charter to the Dartmouth Steam Railway and Riverboat Company, to run passenger trips around Dartmouth Harbour and up river to Totnes.

Incorporated in 1996 in Denver, Colorado, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Communications, which acquired the company in 2000. Verio was formed from a consolidation of over 200 smaller Internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting services. History Verio was founded by Darin Brannan and Justin Jaschke, and several senior management team members subsequently joined from OneComm/Nextel. The company idea, including the initial business plan and pitch deck, began in the halls of Norwest Venture Partners after several months of market diligence and target acquisition discussions. Venture Capitalists Mr. George J. Still, Jr. and Darin Brannan from Norwest Venture Partners ultimately teamed with Mr. Steven C. Halstedt from the Centennial Funds and Steve Schovee from Telecom Partners to syndicate and launch the business in 1996. In order to validate the strategy and raise capital, Brett Sharenow and Lynn Morris from Morris Associates were hired to create the first detailed engineering-driven financial model consisting of ISPs, core network infrastructure, and server farms, allowing Verio to raise substantial funds ($1.1 billion) from principal founders, several top tier VC's, NTT and institutional investors with which to purchase target acquisitions and build out centralized back office, support, national sales and infrastructure. By the year 2000, Verio had purchased 55 ISP/Hosting companies, most in the U.S. but some in Europe. During this time Verio went public on the NASDAQ, trading under the symbol VRIO, with a market value exceeding $1 billion. Shortly after the IPO, in early 2000, Verio was sold to NTT at a per-share price of $73, a total cost slightly exceeding $5 billion. Because NTT was a 53% Japanese government-owned company, foreigners were not allowed to own NTT stock, according to Japanese law at the time,\\"Late Starter NTT Moves on U.S., Europe\\", Keith Dawson, Industry Standard's Media Grok email newsletter, May 09 2000. and therefore the buy-out was a 100% cash deal, making it one of the highest grossing deals of the dotcom era. The United States Congress held hearings over the transaction to ensure it did not violate national security concerns. The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation expressed concern that the Japanese government, which owned 53 percent of NTT at the time, could gain access to classified information should the U.S. government use Verio's network to tap Internet communications during an investigation. To placate these concerns, NTT agreed to form a separate division within the company staffed only by U.S. citizens to handle any work in support of government investigations. As a result, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recommended that President Clinton allow the $5.5 billion purchase to proceed. The deal also prompted scrutiny of Japan's openness to foreign telecom competitors. Shortly after the announced deal, the NASDAQ stock market crashed in the spring of 2000 in the dot-com bubble burst. The agreed price of $73 remained and NTT and Verio completed the transaction by the fall of 2000. Verio continues to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of NTT Communications. At the end of 2005, the backbone and some dedicated hosting centers moved to NTT America, with the web hosting business staying with Verio. At the same time, the European arm, Verio Europe, was moved in its entirety to NTT Europe. In October 2006, Verio Europe was renamed NTT Europe Online. In late May 2015, Verio Shared SMB hosting division, as a business unit of NTT America, Inc. (“NTT America”), was sold to The Endurance International Group, Inc. (“Endurance”), a consolidator and provider of web solutions. Endurance has acquired retail web hosting customers for small and medium-sized business, including Shared, VPS and Dedicated customers. Endurance will continue to provide web hosting, email and domain name services under the Verio name. http://verio-transition.com/faqs/ https://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting- news/eigs-acquisition-of-verio-and-site5-nets-86000-new-subscribers On March 9, 1998 Verio's President Mark D. Johnson, a major contributor to the business, suffered a heart attack and died while on a business trip. Some of the ISPs purchased by Verio Verio was initially built on a business model known as a \\"rollup\\", composed entirely of smaller companies operating under the Verio brand name. By the year 2000, Verio had purchased more than 50 small ISPs and hosting companies,The Internet Data Services Report , MorganStanley, 11 August 1999, p. 30. most in the US but also in Europe, ranging in price from under US$1 million to over US$100 million per ISP. These companies were often mature and well-known brand names in their local markets — more well known than Verio — and often continued to operate with a great deal of local autonomy even after purchase by Verio. Some of the companies purchased by Verio were leading pioneers in the internet industry (Digital Nation, NorthWestNet), representing the first wave of commercial ISP access and hosting in regional markets around the US and Europe.

He is best known for being the original host of The Connection, produced by WBUR and syndicated to other NPR stations, and for Open Source, a weekly radio program on WBUR. Background Christopher Lydon is a graduate of Boston's Roxbury Latin School and Yale University. Journalistic history Lydon is a former journalist with The New York Times, and anchored The Ten-O'Clock News on WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts. After WGBH cancelled its nightly news program, he moved to WBUR, where in 1994 he became host of The Connection. In 2001, he and his longtime producer Mary McGrath were fired after a high-profile contract dispute with WBUR. McGrath's and Lydon's claim, rejected by the station, was that they, not WBUR, were the true creators of The Connection - moving it far beyond the initial WBUR template to become the successful, widely syndicated program. During his tenure on The Connection, Lydon frequently discussed Internet topics, and his Radio Open Source blog became a launchpad for international broadcasts and other activities. While a fellow at Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet & Society in 2003, Lydon began recording in-depth interviews focused on blogging and politics, posting the downloadable audio files as part of his blog. Dave Winer, also a Berkman Fellow, created an RSS enclosure feed for Lydon's MP3 interview files, an event credited with sparking the growth of podcasting. . Christopher Lydon is credited with creating the first podcast ever recorded in July 2003. He also launched the political site Bopnews (for \\"Blogging of the President\\") during the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign.
