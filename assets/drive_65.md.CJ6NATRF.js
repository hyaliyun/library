It was developed by David McCusker with the aim of creating a minimal database replacement that would be reliable, flexible, and efficient, and use a file format close to plain text.  Usage  The Mork format was used in most Mozilla-based projects, including the Mozilla browser suite, SeaMonkey, Firefox, and Thunderbird. In Firefox, it was used for browsing history data and form history data. In Thunderbird, it is still used for many things, such as address book data (.mab files) and the mail folder summaries (.msf files).  Criticisms  Mork has many suboptimal properties. For example, despite the aim of efficiency, storing Unicode text takes three or six bytes per character. The file format has been severely criticized by Jamie Zawinski, a former Netscape engineer. He has lambasted the ostensibly \\"textual\\" format on the grounds that it is \\"not human-readable\\", bemoaned the impossibility of writing a correct parser for the format, and referred to it as \\"...the single most braindamaged file format that I have ever seen in my nineteen year career\\". In response, McCusker stated that the problems with Mork resulted from \\"conflicting requirements\\" and that he merely fixed scalability issues in bad code he \\"inherited\\". The Register lambasted the Mork database with their article \\"Why has Thunderbird turned into a turkey?\\"  Obsolescence  The replacement system, used for storing all user configuration data, is called MozStorage. MozStorage is based on the SQLite database. Beginning with Firefox 3.0, Firefox uses it for its history, form history and bookmark data. The storage engine was also included in Firefox 2.0, but only for use with extensions. Mork was completely removed from Firefox in 2011. Plans existed for Mork to be replaced with MozStorage in Thunderbird 3.0., but as of 2011 still used the Mork file format.

It is adjacent to Maldon, near the River Blackwater. It is often overshadowed by its historic neighbour, and one could mistakenly think it to be the same town, as the two have merged with one another over the years. It has a population of 7,627,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish headcounts : Maldon Retrieved 19 August 2010 increasing to 8,175 at the 2011 Census. Heybridge has a number of residential areas, most recognisable is the newer Bovis housing estates to the west of the town, which were built in 1995. Before building commenced, a full archaeological dig was undertaken and the excavations showed the existence of an important Iron Age settlement and ritual complex, a large Roman settlement and a succeeding Saxon settlement, as well as scattered pre-historic remains. Along the Goldhanger road to the east are situated a number of traditional British holiday campsites, catering for both permanent residents and visitors. History Heybridge was originally called Tidwalditun. The name Heybridge came from the high bridge that was built over the River Blackwater in the Middle Ages, at Heybridge Square (the junction of Heybridge Street, Holloway Road, and the Causeway). This was a 5-arched stone bridge and it was replaced in 1870 by a 2-arched brick one.Fitch, Edward Arthur: Maldon and the River Blackwater. Gowers, 1894. Much of the water flow down this part of the river had, by then, been diverted into the River Chelmer by diversion work done during construction of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. Some people believe that the River Blackwater at Heybridge, near where the \\"high bridge\\" was later constructed, was the site of the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD. This belief, however, is contentious. The site of the battle cannot be unambiguously determined from the poem The Battle of Maldon itself, and over the years, various people have had different theories about where it happened. The key role of an island in the poem would seem to make the traditional site of the battle at Northey Island to the south more likely. The island in question is within shouting distance of the mainland, which would rule out Osea Island to the east. Heybridge was an agricultural village until the 1970s and 80s, when a considerable proportion of the local farm land was given over to house building. The main industry in Heybridge itself, until it ceased trading in 1984, was the agricultural machinery manufacturer E H Bentall & Co. Established in 1805 on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, the company grew to be a large factory complex that operated for nearly 180 years. By 1914 Bentalls had 600‚Äì700 employees. During the first world war they took on female workers for the first time, and the workshop was equipped with pneumatic hoists. After the war, though, the fortunes of the company declined ‚Äì largely due to its involvement in the Agricultural & General Engineers association. After A G E went bust in 1933 Bentalls gradually began to recover. In 1961 E H Bentall and Co was taken over by the Acrow group. Acrows went into receivership in 1984 and Bentalls factory closed down. Bentalls started life in the large building which still stands on the canal bank near the corner of Hall Road and Heybridge Street. It expanded across the road, eventually occupying all the land between Heybridge Street and the canal, with the exception of the site of the flour mill at Going's wharf, adjacent to the Wave bridge. In the early 1970s, a new factory complex was built on the other side of the canal, on land where Bentalls had previously had only offices and a foundry, and the land along Heybridge Street was vacated. Today, the Bentalls shopping centre occupies the later site. Facilities Heybridge's facilities include a number of takeaways, a small supermarket, chemist, vets and dentist; many are situated around the Bentall's Shopping Complex along the Colchester Road. The town is also home to the popular Heybridge Swifts football club, currently competing in the Isthmian League Division One North. Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal The Chelmer and Blackwater canal at Heybridge The final stage of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal runs from Beeleigh through Heybridge and terminates at Heybridge Basin. This stage of the canal required much planning and work at its inception, as a constant running water supply was needed to the two mills nearby, in Langford and Heybridge. This was achieved through the diversion of the river Blackwater and extensive works around the Beeleigh locks. The Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal was originally used to transport coal & wood to the inland town of Chelmsford, as the direct road via Danbury crests the highest hill in south Essex. The canal was used for this purpose until the late 70s although it had been in steady decline since the Great Eastern Railway opened its lines to Maldon in the 19th century. Today it is mainly used for pleasure boats and fishing. Heybridge Basin fast attack boat the \\"Lowestoft Defender\\" moored in the Blackwater estuary at Heybridge Basin. Another feature is Heybridge Basin, a community at where the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal merges into the tidal Blackwater Estuary, fed by the rivers Blackwater and Chelmer. The two rivers are joined by a lock which is regularly used by pleasure boats. There are two pubs adjacent to the lock (The Old Ship Inn and The Jolly Sailor) which provide traditional British food. There is also a tea room, 'the lock' operated by Wilkin and Sons, the conserves company. The basin offers walks along the seawall and the canal leading back into the heart of Heybridge itself. During the summer months, rowing boat hire is also available. The Heybridge Basin area was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi Sports and recreation Heybridge has a Non-League football club Heybridge Swifts F.C. who play at Scraley Road. Heybridge has a King George's Field (or Plantation) in memorial to King George V, which is locally, and colloquially, known as the Planny'. Notable people Francis Waring (1760‚Äì1833) was the vicar of Heybridge. He was notorious for the extraordinary way he performed the duties of his office. He would read church lessons at breakneck speed, give a very quick sermon of one or two sentences and then run down the aisle and leap onto a horse to gallop off and repeat the performance at two other churches in the area. His domestic arrangements were equally peculiar. Although he wasn't poor, his vicarage was furnished with rough-hewn logs, instead of chairs. His children ate their meals from a trough next to the split-log dining table. He and his wife slept in an enormous wicker cradle suspended from the ceiling. The Waring Room, St Andrew's church hall, is named after him. Edward Hammond Bentall (1814‚Äì1898) was an industrialist who developed the agricultural machinery manufacturing business established by his father William Bentall (1776‚Äì1836) and traded under the name E H Bentall & Co. In 1873 he built a large Italianate house called The Towers at the corner of Goldhanger Road and Colchester Road. The house pioneered concrete block construction and was built with ducted air heating and no fireplaces, although some were added later. The house was demolished in the 1950s.Lacey, Patrick: Maldon And Heybridge. Chalford, 1996 Today the site is occupied by the Towers Estate.

The fort's ramparts have been compared to the Great Wall of China. The site was nominated in 1993 by the Pakistan National Commission for UNESCO world heritage status, and has since been on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The fort is listed as a historical site under the Antiquities Act, 1975 and its subsequent amendments, and is provided protection. Location Rani Kort Forte Ranikot Fort is to the north of Hyderabad on the indus highway (N55). There is also an easy access of about an hour's journey from Karachi to Sann on the Indus Highway. A diversion road, starting a little distance away from Sann, the nearest town, leads to the fort along a rugged road and reaches the eastern gate of the fort, known as Sann Gate. Sann is a rail head on the Kotri-Larkana line of the Pakistan Railway. It is inside the Kirthar National Park, the second largest national park in Pakistan. History The original purpose and architects of Ranikot Fort are unknown. It was formerly believed that the fort was built during the regimes of the Sassanians, the Scythians, the Parthians or the Bactrian Greeks, however, more recent evidence shows that the fort originated under the Talpurs. Archaeologists point to the 17th century as the time of its first construction but Sindh archaeologists now agree that some of the present structures were reconstructed by the Talpur dynasty in 1812 at a cost of 1.2 million rupees (Sindh Gazetteer, 677). The battlements of Ranikot formed the last capital of the Amirs of Sind, when they were brought under the colonial rule of the British Empire. Radiocarbon tests were conducted at the Sann Gate on the charcoal embedded in the mortar of a collapsed pillar of the eastern gate of the fort. These tests have confirmed that this gate was probably renovated between the early part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century, prior to Britain invading the fort when the Kalhoras, or most likely the Talpur Mirs of Sindh ruled over the area. Actually the sample for radiocarbon test was gotten from the pillar which was constructed in later period and it was not part of original and earlier Construction of the fort. Features The fort is huge, connecting several bleak mountains of the Kirthar hills along contours, and measures in length. The fort's wall is interspersed with several bastions, and three are of semi-circular shape. The northern part of the fort's perimeter is a natural high hilly formation while on the other three sides it is covered by fort walls. Within this main fort there is a smaller fort known as the \\"Miri Fort\\" which is about 3 km from the Sann gate, and is reported to have served as the palace of the Mir royal family. The entire fort structure has been built with stone and lime mortar. The fort is built in a zig-zag form, with four entry gates in the shape of a rhomboid. The four gates are namely: Sann Gate, Amri Gate, Shah-Pere Gate and Mohan Gate. Two of the gates, facing each are crossed diagonally by the Sann river; the first gate is on the western side and is skirted by the river water and is difficult to approach. The southern entry gate has a double doors gate. Within the gates there are two niches which have floral ornamentation and carved stones. Ancient Architectural Carving on the walls of Rani Kort The Sann gate is well preserved and can be climbed to reach the top of the fort from both sides to get a scenic view of the terrain around the fort. This gate is also the entrance to the Meeri. Restoration Restoration works were undertaken on the fort, particularly on the Sann Gate complex, the fortification wall extending south including the mosque and the small Meeri fort or palace within the main fort. These were undertaken by the Archaeology department of Pakistan, the Department of Culture of Sindh and the Dadu district administration. Following allegations of poor construction and favoritism in award of contracts an enquiry was instituted in 2005. The Enquiry Commission's report indicated that the restoration works were poorly done with cement and new stone work without conforming to the \\"Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites\\" and recommended stoppage of further work on the fort. Based on this report further restoration work was suspended in 2006.

Future TV was also available via satellite in the Arab World, European Union, United States, Canada, and Australia. Politically, the channel supported the views of the Future Movement. The channel also had a sister channel, Future News, which is also defunct.  History Future Television was a Lebanese owned and operated company founded in 1993. First launched in Lebanon on February 15, 1993, Future Television, although the youngest of the Lebanese stations back then, became the nation's fastest growing station. In October 1994, Future Television started a trial satellite broadcasting over the footprint of Arabsat 1D. The testing period lasted two months. Shortly after, Future International was launched on the Arabsat 2A transponder. In 1996, in compliance with the new Lebanese audio visual law, Future Television restructured its ownership. Future Television presently has around 90 new shareholders, all from the Lebanese business, social and media elite. Future Television was forced into closing on May 9, during the 2008 Lebanon conflict. After moving its broadcasting headquarters, the station was back on the air on May 13 at 4:30 p.m (Lebanese Local Time). On May 16, the station went back to its original offices. In September 2019, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced the suspension of work at his Future TV satellite television channel after 26 years of broadcasting, citing financial reasons for halting operations. In a statement issued September 18 by his media office, Hariri said: ‚ÄúIt is with a heavy heart that I announce today the decision to suspend work at Future TV and settle workers‚Äô wages for the same financial reasons that led to the closing of Al-Mustaqbal newspaper. The decision was not an easy one for me or for the men and women of the Future Movement nor is it for the generation of the founding personnel and the millions of Lebanese and Arab viewers of Future TV who had stayed loyal to the station for more than a quarter of a century‚Äù. The decision highlights the worsening financial crisis in which Hariri has been trapped since the dissolution of Saudi-Oger, his father's construction and services company in Saudi Arabia. The company had been the pillar of the Hariri family fortune.

Cit√© Soleil (; English: Sun City) is an extremely impoverished and densely populated commune located in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area in Haiti. Cit√© Soleil originally developed as a shanty town and grew to an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 residents, the majority of whom live in extreme poverty. The area is generally regarded as one of the poorest and most dangerous areas of the Western Hemisphere and it is one of the biggest slums in the Northern Hemisphere. The area has virtually no sewers and has a poorly maintained open canal system that serves as its sewage system, few formal businesses but many local commercial activities and enterprises, sporadic but largely unpaid for, electricity, a few hospitals, and two government schools, Lycee Nationale de Cite Soleil, and Ecole Nationale de Cite Soleil. For several years until 2007, the area was ruled by a number of gangs, each controlling their own sectors. But government control was reestablished after a series of operations in early 2007 by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with the participation of the local population. The neighborhood is located at the western end of the runway of Toussaint Louverture International Airport and adjoins the grounds of the former Hasco Haitian American sugar complex. It began with the construction in 1958 of homes for 52 families. In the summer of 1966, a mysterious fire in the slum of La Saline displaced many of its residents. 1,197 homes were built there and it was named Cit√© Simone, after Haiti's First Lady Simone Ovide Duvalier. In 1972, a major fire near the central market of Port-au-Prince displaced yet more people who ended up in the Boston section of Cit√© Simone. In 1983, the census recorded 82,191 people in Cit√© Simone. Originally designed to house sugar workers, Cit√© Simone later housed manual laborers for a local Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Neoliberal reforms beginning in the early 1970s made this place a magnet for squatters from around the countryside looking for work in the newly constructed factories. This movement accelerated in the early 1980s with the destruction of the Creole pigs by American order in response to an African swine flu outbreak, followed by the rise of Finance Minister Leslie Delatour who took this post following the ouster of Jean- Claude Duvalier in 1986. Delatour openly advocated the depopulation of much of the Haitian countryside and that these people work instead in cities, living in places such as the newly named Cit√© Soleil, though not for Hasco that Delatour shut down in 1987. This industrial sector was however damaged following the 1991 coup d'√©tat that deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, causing a boycott of Haitian products that closed the EPZ. Cit√© Soleil continued to be plagued by extreme poverty and persistent unemployment, with high rates of illiteracy. Half of the houses of Cit√© Soleil are made of cement with a metal roof, half are made completely of scavenged material. An estimated 60 to 70% of houses have no access to a latrine, particularly in the marshy Brooklyn area which includes Cit√© Carton. Armed gangs roamed the streets and terrorized the neighborhood. Every few blocks was controlled by one of more than 30 armed factions. Though the gangs no longer rule, murder, rape, kidnapping, looting, and shootings are still common. The area has been called a \\"microcosm of all the ills in Haitian society: endemic unemployment, illiteracy, non-existent public services, unsanitary conditions, widespread crime and armed violence\\". After the devastating 2010 earthquake, it took nearly two weeks for relief aid to arrive in Cit√©-Soleil. Overview Sign for a Cit√© Soleil women's group, 2002. The sign translates, \\"Organization of Activist Women of Cit√© Soleil\\". Most of the residents of Cit√©-Soleil are children or young adults. The mortality rate is high from diseases such as AIDS, or from violence. At times Cit√© Soleil has been filled with armed gangs. Politically affiliated gangs or militias, often with quasi-official powers, have been a regular element of Haitian politics throughout the country's history. The fighting led to wide scale charges by neighborhood residents that the United Nations stabilizing force has permitted conditions that led to the death of unarmed bystanders. In 2004 they were accused of ignoring violence by the Haitian police, the criminal roots of the kidnapping and undermining of president Jean Bertrand Aristide's security police force. During the mid-1990s, the city's population was terrorized by armed gangs which drove the local police out; this situation prevented officials aid workers from intervening to provide help. In 1999, Cit√© Soleil was set on fire by a gang and at least 50 shacks were burned. By 2002, the violence escalated as the gangs began warring with each other in addition to preying on ordinary people. Many inhabitants had temporarily left to escape the turmoil. In a series of operations from 2004 to 2007, UN peacekeepers tried to seize control from the gangs in Cit√© Soleil and end the chaos. Although the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) has been deployed since 2004, it continues to struggle for control over the armed gangs and the violent confrontations continue. MINUSTAH maintains an armed checkpoint at the entrance to Cit√© Soleil and the road is blocked with armed vehicles. In December 2004, a group of armed ex-soldiers occupied Aristide's home against the wishes of the Haitian government. In January 2006, two Jordanian peacekeepers were killed in Cit√© Soleil. The UN has described the human rights situation in Haiti as \\"catastrophic\\". Current status The United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) has been in Haiti since 2004. It now numbers 8,000 troops but continues to struggle for control over the armed gangs. In October 2006, a group of heavily armed Haitian police were able to enter Cit√© Soleil for the first time in three years and were able to remain one hour as armored UN troops patrolled the area. Since this is where the armed gangs take their kidnap victims, the Haitian police's ability to penetrate the area even for such a short time was seen as a sign of progress. Before Christmas 2006, the UN force announced that it would take a tougher stance against gang members in Port-au-Prince, but since then the atmosphere there has not improved; the armed roadblocks and barbed wire barricades have not been removed. After four people were killed and another six injured in a UN operation exchange of fire with criminals in Cit√© Soleil in late January 2007, the United States announced that it would contribute $20 million to create jobs in Cit√© Soleil. In early February 2007, 700 UN troops flooded Cit√© Soleil, resulting in a major gun battle. Although the troops make regular forcible entries into the area, a spokesperson said this one was the largest attempted so far by the UN troops. On July 28, 2007, Edmond Mulet, the UN Special Representative in Haiti, warned of a sharp increase in lynchings and other mob attacks in Haiti. He said that the UN Stabilization Mission would launch a campaign to remind people that lynching is a crime. On August 2, 2007, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Haiti to assess the role of the UN forces, announcing that he would visit Cit√© Soleil during his visit. He said that as it is Haiti's largest slum, it is the most important target for UN peacekeepers in gaining control over the armed gangs. The Haitian president Ren√© Pr√©val has expressed ambivalent feelings about the UN security presence, saying, \\"If the Haitian people were asked if they wanted the UN forces to leave they would say yes.\\" Survivors at times blame the UN peacekeepers for deaths of relatives. Critics of UN Stabilization Mission's plan feel that the United Nations mandate is unrealistic, treating a political problem as a security problem. 2010 Haiti earthquake A survivor camp in Cit√© Soleil in January 2010 On January 12, 2010, at 21:53 UTC (4:53 PM local time) Haiti was struck by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital, Port- au-Prince, in L√©og√¢ne. As the biggest slum of Port-au-Prince, Cit√© Soleil fared relatively well, as most of its cinder block and corrugated steel shacks survived. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res reopened its Choscal Hospital (which operated between 2005 and 2007 during the gang war) in the heart of the slum within 24 hours. However, the area remained in desperate need of help, according to World Emergency Relief. Gang members who escaped from Haiti's damaged prison returned to the area to continue to commit crimes. The crime rate rose and police urged citizens to take matters into their own hands. As of January 23, 2010, Cit√© Soleil had largely remained neglected by earthquake relief workers and was doing what it could to survive and help on its own. Samaritan's Purse worked in Cit√© Soleil by building the largest cholera treatment center during the outbreak.

H, 1st West Virginia Cavalry Regiment, standing next to the chair in which General Ulysses S. Grant sat during General Robert E. Lee's surrender, presented to Blackmar by his friend and comrade Major General Henry Capehart. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress The 15th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, known as the Anderson Cavalry and the 160th Volunteers, was a three-year cavalry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was recruited and formed in the summer of 1862 by officers and men of the Anderson Troop, an independent company of the Pennsylvania Volunteers that had been mustered the previous November. Until the last three months of the war the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry was an independent unit reporting directly to the headquarters of the Army of the Cumberland, performing escort, scouting, courier and other details for the commanding general. Composed of hand-picked men most of whom were qualified to receive commissions, it became the favorite unit of both Generals William S. Rosecrans and George H. Thomas. History The regiment of 1100 men in ten companies was raised by officers of the Anderson Troop in July and August 1862 from more than 3,000 applicants representing 30 Pennsylvania counties. The average age of the recruits was 20 and all had been required to submit letters of recommendation from upstanding citizens of their local communities. After the first 200 men reported to \\"Camp Alabama\\" at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, six companies (B through G) were mustered into United States service by a captain of the regular 1st Cavalry on August 22. Anderson Troop was to have become Company A, but the consolidation never took place and Company A was raised from recruits in October 1862. The Anderson Cavalry, as the regiment was immediately known, was authorized to wear a distinctive dragoon-style shell jacket with orange trimming instead of cavalry yellow. =Antietam campaign= Partially organized, without any commissioned officers except their prospective colonel Capt. William J. Palmer, and equipped only with sabers, half of the 900 soldiers then in camp were sent to help the Army of the Potomac resist the Confederate Invasion of Maryland. Approximately 400 men, provided horses and carbines, were scattered as pickets, skirmished with Confederates near Hagerstown and participated in the Battle of Antietam, where one trooper was killed. Palmer was captured after the battle while scouting for General George B. McClellan behind the lines. =Army of the Cumberland= The 15th returned to Camp Alabama for drilling by non-commissioned regulars stationed there. On November 7, 1862, it left Carlisle by railroad for the Department of the Cumberland under its lieutenant colonel, William Spencer, traveling over a period of three days to Louisville, Kentucky, via Indianapolis, Indiana. There it drilled and was mounted and equipped on November 22. Only 12 of 36 company officers had yet been appointed, all by Department Commanding General William Rosecrans upon their arrival in Louisville, and only two-thirds of the non-commissioned officers had been named, so that widespread discontent with the lack of leadership spread through the regiment when it was sent on December 8 to Nashville, Tennessee. Making its march mounted and in inclement weather, when it reached Bowling Green, Kentucky, it was sent on an all-night march to Glasgow, Kentucky, where Confederate General John Hunt Morgan was reported camped with part of his regiment, but when the Anderson Cavalry charged into the town at dawn Morgan had left an hour before. The 15th remained in Bowling Green until December 21, reaching Nashville and the Army of the Cumberland late on the afternoon of December 24. Lt-Col. Spencer, who had been Palmer's first lieutenant in the Anderson Troop and had previously served 15 years as a sergeant in the regulars, became too ill to take to saddle and command of the still partially organized regiment devolved to the senior major (and former first sergeant), Adolph G. Rosengarten. =Stones River campaign= Mutiny at Nashville The regiment was ordered to march with the army on December 26, 1862, towards the Confederate Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro, but all but 300 of the enlisted men refused to leave camp. On December 28, Rosecrans took 23 more men from the Anderson Troop previously recommended for commissions and made them temporary officers to address the complaints of the disgruntled soldiers regarding lack of leadership. 200 troopers still refused a new order to march the next day, however. Rosecrans then ordered a show of force be made by the division of Gen. James D. Morgan, part of the garrison at Nashville, to compel obedience. 100 of the men in camp moved to the front of their own volition before a show of force could be made. Rather than apply duress with the insubordinate soldiers, Morgan used a promise that they would meet with Rosecrans to induce the remainder to leave camp under the command of the lieutenant colonel of the 10th Illinois Volunteers. That evening however, after encountering a brigade of Wheeler's Confederate cavalry and a battery of artillery blocking the road at La Vergne, they returned to their original camp in Nashville. On December 31 those in camp were ordered to perform wagon train escort duty but again refused. 415 soldiers were arrested and confined for insubordination. They submitted a list of grievances as cause, alleging a failure to appoint a sufficient number of company officers (which was true; seven companies had no captain and four had no officers at all), being improperly mustered into federal service (or not at all), inadequate equipment and weapons, and enlistment inducements they claimed had not been honored. On January 19, 1863, Rosecrans offered to release from confinement those immediately willing to be restored to duty. 208 confined in the city workhouse still refused, but the others were returned to the ranks. Those returning to duty did so with recalcitrance and four were returned to confinement when they refused to perform picket duty. Battle of Stones River The 300 troopers who had marched with the army scouted the advance of the Union right wing, determining that the Confederate army was concentrating on Murfreesboro. It twice encountered Confederate forces, skirmishing with dismounted Texas cavalry units at Nolensville on December 27. In the second engagement, on December 29 at Wilkinson's Cross Roads west of Murfreesboro, its skirmishers were ambushed by Confederate pickets of the 10th South Carolina Infantry, leading to an impetuous mounted charge with carbines by the battalion under Rosengarten. However two regiments of Confederates concealed in a corn field were drawn up in line of battle behind a fence paralleling the pike. Stopped by the fence and receiving aimed volleys of musket fire at point-blank range, the regiment quickly lost 11 men killed, 50 wounded and 9 missing. Rosengarten was killed and Major Frank B. Ward, another former sergeant in the Anderson Troop, was mortally wounded, dying on January 11, 1863. Ward was barely 20 at the time he was wounded. Under the command of a captain, the survivors of the regiment deployed with Stanley's cavalry on the right of the Union position, taking part without loss in two mounted saber charges late on the first day of the Battle of Stones River that drove a brigade of Confederate cavalry from the field, with troopers of the Anderson Cavalry capturing the colors of the 3rd Alabama Cavalry. On New Year's Day it escorted the army's supply wagons back to Nashville, repulsing several attempts by the Confederate cavalry of Gen. Joseph Wheeler to destroy the train. Privates John Tweedale (Company B) and John Gregory Bourke (Company D, and just 16 years old), both of whom became officers in the regular army after the war, were later honored for gallantry at Stones River, two of the six troopers of the Anderson Cavalry who eventually received the Medal of Honor. In the week after it arrived in Nashville, total casualties of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry were 14 dead, 10 wounded, and 57 captured, many of whom had been wounded on December 29 and were in a hospital captured early on the first day of battle at Stones River. =Subsequent campaigning= 1863 reorganization Colonel Palmer was exchanged in January 1863 and resumed command of the now dismounted regiment on February 7. It moved it into a new camp at Murfreesboro, Camp Garesch√©, named for Rosecrans' chief of staff killed at Stones River, where Palmer assembled his command and promised it a complete reorganization by the end of the month. Nine of the 12 company officers originally appointed by Rosecrans resigned February 27 and were not re-appointed. The regiment was expanded to 12 companies with the old companies broken up and the men redistributed. Palmer chose permanent officers to fill all vacancies, the majority of whom came from the enlisted ranks of the Anderson Troop and had been serving as temporary officers since December 28. A new lieutenant colonel from outside the regiment, Charles B. Lamborn, arrived on March 7 to replace Spencer, who resigned in poor health on February 6. A few days later new equipment was issued and 200 horses received. Mounted drill resumed and by April the regiment was again conducting scouting operations for the Army of the Cumberland east of Murfreesboro. The remaining 212 confined men were returned to duty with charges against them suspended on condition of good behavior henceforth. A final organizational crisis occurred on May 8, 1863, when 13 officers appointed on March 1 resigned as a group because their commissions from Pennsylvania Governor A. G. Curtin had not yet been acted upon. Palmer accepted the resignations and promoted replacements from the ranks of the regiment. Department of the Cumberland For the remainder of the war, the 15th Pennsylvania remained in the Department of the Cumberland, with Companies B, H, and K tasked as escort for department headquarters. The remaining nine companies scouted, conducted periodic raids, and frequently engaged in skirmishes under Palmer. The regiment performed with distinction during the Tullahoma Campaign and at the Battle of Chickamauga, and then participated in the Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville Campaigns. At Chattanooga the Andersons were initially camped at Cameron Hill, but the loss of their wagons to Wheeler's cavalry while foraging for fodder on October 2 resulted in the 15th Pennsylvania moving to the Sequatchie Valley, where corn, cattle and pigs were plentiful. Camping near Dunlap in October and Pikeville for the remainder of the winter, the Andersons performed picket duties and gathered forage, particularly beef for the army and corn for its horses and mules. The relief of Knoxville began a 70-day winter campaign in upper East Tennessee for Palmer, Lamborn and 175 men of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry, reinforced by a detachment of the 10th Ohio Cavalry and attached to the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Ohio. On December 10 near Gatlingburg they surprised a similarly-sized force of Confederate cavalry, many of whom were Cherokee, in its camp and forced them back over the mountains into North Carolina. Two weeks later on Christmas Eve the 15th Pennsylvania suffered a sharp reverse near Dandridge when the battalion was trapped momentarily in a fenced pocket during a skirmish. Ten troopers were captured and confined in Andersonville Prison, where half of them perished. Five days later, on nearly the same ground, the 15th Pennsylvania made two mounted charges during the Battle of Mossy Creek, contributing to the Union victory. The scouts made by the Anderson Cavalry were generally conducted at night and the regiment became known among the local, largely Unionist communities as \\"Palmer's Owls.\\" Winter campaigning proved destructive of the regiment's horses, and when it went into camp at Rossville, Georgia, in March 1864, its remaining mounts were taken for Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. The 15th Pennsylvania was sent back to Nashville by foot and train for remount, arriving May 8, and was out of field service for three months, finally receiving new horses in July. The regiment also received and drilled new recruits and marched on August 1 for Chattanooga, where it arrived two weeks later. There it guarded the railroad lines between Chattanooga and Atlanta while also scouting for movements of Hood's defeated army. On September 13 while at Calhoun, Georgia, it received new orders to return to East Tennessee to locate and intercept the enemy cavalry brigade of John S. Williams. Unable to do so, the campaign ended in mid-October and the 15th Pennsylvania returned to Camp Lingle (named for 1st Lt. Harvey S. Lingle of Company G, killed at Mossy Creek) at Wauhatchie Station, where it camped until December 20. Between December 28, 1864, and March 2, 1865, the 15th Pennsylvania was encamped at Huntsville, Alabama. In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Nashville, it pursued the supply trains of Hood's army, catching and destroying all his pontoons near Russellville, Alabama, on December 31, and more than 300 wagons that day and the first day of 1865, penetrating into Mississippi as far as Fulton. =Concluding operations= In mid-March 1865 the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry was assigned to the 1st Brigade, Cavalry Division, District of East Tennessee, and moved back to Chattanooga. Col. Palmer was breveted a brigadier general to command the brigade. The brigade set out on March 21 as the vanguard of a division-sized raiding force under Major General George Stoneman sent into North Carolina and southwest Virginia to destroy as much railroad as they could to interrupt the flow of supplies to the beleaguered Army of Northern Virginia. The 15th Pennsylvania split at Jacksonville, Virginia, on April 5, most accompanying Stoneman's force towards Salem, North Carolina, but a battalion of 230 under Major William Wagner was sent north to make a demonstration at Lynchburg, a key rail center, to give the impression that it was the vanguard of a much larger force threatening Lee's line of retreat. In four days Wagner's battalion destroyed numerous bridges and reached the outskirts of Lynchburg on the morning of April 8 before turning south to rejoin the main body of Stoneman's force at Salisbury, North Carolina. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, 20 miles to the east, the day after the demonstration. The regiment subsequently captured General Braxton Bragg and his staff and pursued Confederate President Jefferson Davis through Georgia. The 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment, numbering 627 officers and men, was mustered out at Nashville, Tennessee, on June 21, 1865. 162 recruits just received were held in service as \\"Company A, Anderson Cavalry\\" at department headquarters until mustered out on July 18.

In his time with the West German national team, he earned 26 caps and scored 21 goals. His position was that of an inside right forward. In his youth he learned to play football at Eintracht N√ºrnberg. In 1940 he became a member of the then famous 1. FC N√ºrnberg, debuting in the first team on 30 November 1941. Until 1964 he appeared more than 900 times in the first team of the so-called Club and scored about 700 goals. In 1948 and 1961 he led the team to German championships, in 1962 to the German Cup. 38 years old he even appeared 21 times in the founding season of the German Bundesliga. He also was top scorer of the Oberliga S√ºd in 1950‚Äì51 and 1951‚Äì52. His first cap for the national team was in 1950, when he played instead of the injured Fritz Walter. He was a member of the West German team that won their first World Cup in 1954. In the final match against Hungary Morlock scored West Germany's first goal to start the comeback after going 2‚Äì0 down. He received his last cap in a friendly game against Egypt in December 1958. As a player, Morlock's strengths were a sound technique coupled with fighting spirit. As a linkman he felt at home best between defense and attack, but he was also dangerous in front of the goal.

History The Sav-A-Center name was first used for a chain of 20 supermarkets in the greater New Orleans, Louisiana, area. The division operated throughout Louisiana, and had two stores in Mississippi. In addition, the Sav-A-Center division included three regular A&P; stores, one of which was a small \\"corner grocery\\" in the French Quarter of New Orleans that A&P; had been operating since 1931. By August 2005, Sav-A-Center operated primarily in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans metropolitan areas, and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Many stores sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Twenty-one stores reopened within a few months of the storm; two others following remodeling to repair flood damage. Five stores were closed permanently due to severe damage to the stores and surrounding areas. In April 2007, the chain exited the Baton Rouge area. On May 30, 2007, A&P; confirmed that it was planning to exit the New Orleans area, and was seeking buyers for its 20 remaining Sav-A-Center stores. A&P; said the company cited its decision to focus on its remaining operations in the Northeast, where it operated the majority of its stores. It was announced in September 2007 that the remaining Sav-A-Center stores would be sold to the locally owned Rouses chain. Rouses took over 16 Sav-A-Center stores, including the Mississippi stores and the French Quarter A&P;, sold one to competing chain Breaux Mart, and closed the others. =A&P; Sav-A-Center= Architectural rendering of an A&P; Sav-A- Center store The Sav-A-Center name was also added to many of A&P;'s Northeastern and mid-South Atlantic stores in the mid-1980s, shortly after A&P; purchased most of Stop & Shop‚Äôs New York metro area stores following the chain‚Äôs exit from the market area. After the sale, A&P; found itself sharing strip-mall space with many Bradlees stores, which at the time were owned by Stop & Shop, and in some cases the two chains shared a building in a manner not unlike today‚Äôs Walmart supercenters. When A&P; took over the supermarkets, a common wall was built to separate the businesses. In many areas, including Tidewater region/Hampton Roads, Virginia, in North Carolina, plus most of A&P;'s Northeastern area, traditional A&P; stores were remodeled as Sav-A- Centers; the classic A&P; sign's red, orange, and yellow colors became shades of kelly green. In the Northeast, the former Stop & Shop stores were larger than most of the traditional A&P; stores. The company tried to use the Sav-A- Center conversion as a part of its \\"We've Built a Proud New Feeling\\" campaign, which was created to shed the company's high-price, stodgy perception. The campaign featured images of larger, cleaner, modern-style stores, happy, upscale-looking shoppers, and friendly, cooperative staff. (It was during this time that A&P; debuted its Futurestores.) The Sav-A-Center stores were renovated with oversized graphics of fresh-looking produce and baked goods; they also were outfitted with IBM-POS checkouts. However, A&P; had trouble shedding its high-price perception; gradually, the low-volume Sav-A-Centers lost sales and shoppers to stores such as Pathmark (now a division of A&P;) and NYC area-leader ShopRite (the Wakefern retailers' cooperative).

All members of this family are aerobic and form endospores. The family contains four genera: Alicyclobacillus, Effusibacillus, Kyrpidia, and Tumebacillus. When originally created in 2009, Alicyclobacillaceae was a monophyletic family, only including genus Alicyclobacillus. In 2011, the novel genus Kyrpidia was proposed and placed in family Alicyclobacillaceae, and Tumebacillus was placed into the family as well. In 2014, the novel genus Effusibacillus was proposed and added as the fourth member of Alicyclobacillaceae. Alicyclobacillus is the largest genus in Alicyclobacillaceae, with over 20 validly published species. The species are all acidophilic and have thermally resistant endospores. Many species are common soil organisms. Certain Alicyclobacillus species (especially A. acidoterrestris) have been implicated in spoilage of pasteurized fruit juice. Effusibacillus contains three species (as of 2019). Members of this genus have been isolated from a lake in Japan, a lake in Antarctica, and from the blood of a woman. E. lacus and E. pohliae are both thermophiles, with optimum growth temperatures above 50 ¬∞C, while the optimum growth temperature for E. consociatus is 30 ¬∞C. Kyrpidia contains two species (as of 2019). Both species of Kyrpidia have been isolated from areas of high volcanic activity in Tuscany, Italy, and the Azores. The optimum temperature for growth for both members of the genus is approximately 55 ¬∞C. Tumebacillus contains 8 species. Members of this genus have been isolated from arctic permafrost, soil samples, cassava wastewater, decomposing algal scum, river water, and the gut of a vulture. Tumebacillus was found during surveys of nasal airways of infants, an underground subway in Norway, and a mountain observatory in Austria. No member of Alicyclobacillaceae has been found to be infectious. Effusibacillus consociatus was isolated from human blood and Tumebacillus was found during a survey of nasal airways of infants, but in neither instance were the bacteria found to be the cause of infection.

They are used for fire performance.Wu, Elizabeth. Hot Issue: Moths to the Flame. Cincinnati CityBeat. May 30, 2007.  Types of Fire Fan Performance  =Belly Dance= Fire fans are often used in belly dance, especially in tribal fusion belly dance styles. Belly dancers typically move fire fans more slowly and in combination with the layered hip and arm dance movements distinctive to the art of belly dance. =Tech Spinners= Tech fire fan spinners use movements similar to those in poi, and often employ faster spinning and more complex tricks using the fans. Many movements in poi can be translated into fans, such as 3 beat weaves, flowers, etc. Fire fans can also be used in ways similar to small double hoops. However, there are some moves that are completely unique to fans, such as choo choos. =Belly Dance / Tech Combination= Some fire fan performers combine the slower, more graceful, more dance-centric moves of belly dance with the faster, more trick-oriented moves of tech spinners to create a hybrid style of performance.  Types of Fire Fans  =Torch wick= Typically built with anywhere between 3 and 7 spokes, torch wick fans are a common choice for fan spinners of all levels. They are commonly built of aluminum or steel, each with their own pros and cons. Fans are most often built with at least one ring at the base of the fan, though some fans have multiple rings, or none at all. Rings can differ greatly in size from fan to fan (Diameter: 3‚Äì10 cm), and it's not uncommon to see a fan with multiple rings of different sizes. There are also cultural differences. North American tech fan spinners tend to use a small one-finger spinner ring, while Russian tech spinners tend to use a ring large enough to pass the entire hand through. =Rope wick= The construction of the rope wick fan is similar to that of the torch wick style, but the spokes of the rope fan end in rings, through which a piece of Kevlar rope is strung. Rope fans tend to put off more flame than torch fans. Fueling rope wick fans can be difficult at best without a fueling tray, though it is relatively common practice to pour the fuel over the fan, into the fuel dump, keeping it contained. =Collapsible= Collapsible fans are hinged at the base, eliminating the finger loops. This can be a disadvantage to those who prefer to spin the fans, as any move involving fingerspins becomes difficult; collapsible fans tend to be used for slower moves and posing as a result, which can be very impressive when they have a large diameter. Some collapsible fans open to a full one hundred eighty degrees (as opposed to static fans, which are generally in the vicinity of ninety degrees). They can be a better fit for more martial-style fan manipulation, and the ability to open and close the fan adds a different dimension to the performance. While these are the three most common types of fire fans, these are by no means all that is out there. Many people who build their own fire equipment design and prototype creative new fans that are completely their own. =LED= In venues where fire can't be used, some performers use LED fans, or fire fan frames that have LED lights instead of wicks.

She played an important role in Francoist Spain, exerting major influence in the election of Carlos Arias Navarro (when her husband was already ill) and in censoring the press.Carmen Polo de Franco of Spain Dies. The Washington Post. 7 February 1988 She was, undoubtedly, the most influential woman in Francoist Spain. She was nicknamed as la Collares ('the one with the necklaces') in Spain. Family She was the daughter of Felipe Polo y Fl√≥rez de Vereterra (1860‚Äì1926), a wealthy lawyer in Oviedo, and Ramona Mart√≠nez-Vald√©s y Mart√≠nez-Vald√©s (1870‚Äì8 February 1914), paternal granddaughter of Claudio Polo-Vereterra y Astudillo and wife Bonifacia Fl√≥rez and sister of Mar√≠a Isabel (married to Jos√© Mar√≠a Sanch√≠z y Sancho), Felipe and Ramona (Zita) (married in Oviedo on 6 February 1932 to Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er). Her aunt Isabel Polo-Vereterra y Fl√≥rez married her relative Luis Vereterra y Estrada. Her great-grandparents were Tel√©sforo Polo y Briz and Isabel Astudillo.Mar√≠a del Carmen Polo y Martinez-Valdez, 1. se√±ora de Meir√°s, GeneAll.net Marriage Her constant smile, pearl necklaces, the wedding's postponement became the inspiration for a verse of \\"La Madel√≥n\\": \\"... el comandante Franco es un gran militar que aplaz√≥ su boda para ir a luchar...\\" (\\"...Commander Franco is a great soldier who postponed his wedding in order to go to war...\\"). It was two years before Franco returned to Oviedo. When he returned, ready to marry, the death of Rafael de Valenzuela, successor to Jos√© Mill√°n Astray as commander of the Spanish Legion, intervened. Franco was offered Valenzuela's command, and promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel. His ambition was too great to resist the opportunity, and he left for Morocco on 18 July 1923, making this promise to his fianc√©e: \\"This year we will be married, above all else. If I do not die in combat, I will return to you.\\" Having become Spain's most decorated soldier, Franco was eventually given a leave of forty days, and royal permission to marry. The wedding took place on 22 October 1923, in the church of San Juan el Real of Oviedo. Franco's best man was King Alfonso XIII, represented by General Antonio Losada, military governor of Asturias. Serving as maid of honour was Isabel Polo, Carmen's aunt. The witnesses were the Marquis de la Vega de Anzo, and Franco's brothers, Nicol√°s and Ram√≥n. Franco did not invite his father, Nicol√°s Franco, whom he had never forgiven for leaving his mother and living in Madrid with another woman. Birth of only child The honeymoon lasted only a few days. Franco was needed in North Africa, and he did not wish to be accompanied by his wife. This forced separation lasted fifteen months. At age 32, Franco was promoted to full colonel and made official commander of the Legion. He finally established a home, in Melilla and Polo joined him. Franco soon rose to the rank of general. This began a new and difficult life for Polo, who would have to accustom herself to her husband's constant and unpredictable reassignments. They moved from Madrid to Zaragoza, back to Oviedo, to the Canary Islands and after the Spanish Civil War, to Salamanca and Burgos. \\"I felt like an authentic nomad\\", she said on one occasion. In the winter of 1926, Polo moved from Zaragoza to Oviedo, hoping to bear a son. The Francos had been married three years and had produced no children. This delay, abnormal at that time, gave rise to many rumours. In the end, Polo gave birth to a daughter, Carmen Franco y Polo, known by the nicknames Nenuca, Carmencita, and Morita. It is alleged that Polo was not the mother and that Carmen was actually the daughter of Franco's younger brother, Ram√≥n Franco and a prostitute who died shortly after giving birth. Spanish Civil War Polo and her husband in San Sebasti√°n in 1941 In July 1936, Polo and her daughter fled to Le Havre, France, on the German steamboat Waldi. They travelled under assumed names for fear of Nenuca being kidnapped. They waited in Le Havre for Antonio Barroso, who transported them to Bayonne, to the house of his former governess Claverie. At the end of September, Franco sent his cousin and confidant, Salgado-Araujo, to find them. In September 1936, Franco was chosen and appointed eneral√≠simo and head of state by the National Defense Board (Junta de Defensa Nacional). Accordingly, Carmen Polo became known as the first lady of Spain. She was generally referred to simply as \\"La Se√±ora\\", and glamorous persona became part of Franco's image. It is rumoured that Jose Antonio de Sangr√≥niz, Franco's chief diplomat, was forced to cancel a reception before the Junta de Burgos (\\"Military Junta of Burgos\\", named after the town where it was formed) because she did not have suitable clothes for the occasion. She would never have this problem again since in 1936, she began to build up a large collection of hats, dresses and pearl necklaces, the last of which became her trademark. First Lady Polo with Francisco Franco, 1968 Polo almost always appeared with her husband. This caused some problems when traveling outside Madrid, since it required that Franco's ministers and advisers also be accompanied by their wives, creating problems with lodging. After the war's end, the question of the head of state's residence presented a problem. Franco was initially inclined to live in the Royal Palace of Madrid, but was disabused of this notion by Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er. Franco instead chose the Palacio Real de El Pardo, where he settled in March 1940 following its restoration. The Francos passed their summers at a home in Meir√°s, and fishing on their yacht Azor. The home, which had formerly belonged to Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, was, according to the official story, bought by \\"popular subscription\\" for more than 400,000 pesetas. Polo embarked on many foreign trips during her time as first lady. She first traveled to Portugal in 1950 and returned in 1958 and 1967. She traveled to Rome in May 1950, to witness the canonization of Antonio Mar√≠a Claret. During the visit, she was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII. On none of her trips abroad was she ever accompanied by her husband. El Pardo was the center of Spanish political life under Franco and also the venue for many of the Franco family's personal events. Protocol was rigorously enforced and largely dictated by la Se√±ora, through the authority of the Casa Civil. One of the most famous events of the Franco family was the marriage of the younger Carmen to Crist√≥bal Mart√≠nez-Bordi√∫, a son of the counts of Arguillo. In addition to his family's land holdings, he also carried the title of Marquis of Villaverde. This greatly pleased Polo, who had long held aspirations of nobility. The union produced several children, amongst others Mar√≠a del Carmen Mart√≠nez-Bordi√∫ y Franco, the Francos' first grandchild. Because of her fondness for wearing big pearl necklaces she was often referred to as La Collares, roughly Lady Necklaces. Later years Coat of arms of Carmen Polo as Lady of Meir√°s (1975-1988) Polo devoted her later years to her grandchildren. On 8 March 1972, her granddaughter Mar√≠a del Carmen married Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and C√°diz, a member of the House of Bourbon. Polo hoped that this \\"operation\\" would lead to her granddaughter becoming queen. In fact, Juan Carlos ultimately succeeded to the throne. By that time, Franco was greatly diminished, both physically and mentally. With Franco's death, the family's fortunes changed dramatically. On 26 November 1975, six days after her husband's death, King Juan Carlos gave Polo the hereditary title Se√±ora de Meir√°s (English: Lady of Meir√°s), named after her and her husband's summer residence. She was also given the accompanying dignity Grande de Espa√±a (English: Grandee of Spain). The title and dignity were inherited by her grandson Francisco Franco (who also became the 11th Marquis of Villaverde after the death of his father). In the ensuing years, Polo witnessed the disintegration of her family. On 31 January 1976, she left El Pardo for the last time. In 1978, her daughter was arrested at Madrid Barajas International Airport for attempting to smuggle 300 million pesetas worth of gold, jewellery and medals that had belonged to her father.La cosecha del dictador, El Pa√≠s, 9 September 2007 She separated from her husband and moved to Paris, where she lived with the antiquarian Jean-Marie Rossi. On 7 February 1984, Polo's great-grandson, Francisco (\\"Fran\\"), was killed at 11 in a car accident. In her final years, Polo rarely left her house, hearing Mass at home. She isolated herself completely, ignoring (and being ignored by) the press and refusing to read anything about politics or about her husband. She explained, \\"It is necessary to have much Christian resignation, in light of the turmoils of my life\\". Polo died in Madrid on 6 February 1988, at the age of 87, and was buried at Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo. Her husband, who had previously been entombed at the Valle de los Ca√≠dos outside Madrid, was exhumed and reburied with her on 24 October 2019.The Guardian Ancestors References External links * Partial biography * Spanish Wikipedia Category:Francoist Spain Category:Spanish nobility Category:People from Oviedo Category:1900 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Spanish women in politics Category:Burials in Madrid Category:Grandees of Spain Category:Francisco Franco Category:Dames Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Christ (Portugal) Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Merit (Portugal) ","title":"Carmen Polo, 1st Lady of Meir√°s"},{"id":"3638657","text":"The Caryophanaceae were a family of Gram-positive bacteria, now reclassified into the Planococcaceae.

She was the first mayor of the Borough of East York, Ontario, and she was one of Metropolitan Toronto's most colourful politicians in a career spanning nearly 25 years. She spent 10 years on the East York school board and 11 years as alderwoman, reeve and mayor on East York Council. During her time in municipal politics she ran in 11 elections and never lost. She was born in Hudson, Quebec, the daughter of a Methodist minister. She was educated at the University of Toronto and then worked as a teacher. She worked as a writer, editing a 12-volume compendium of Canadiana by William Perkins Bull. After her parents died, she moved to East York where she quickly became involved in local politics. She became a school trustee in 1947 and later chair of the school board. In 1958 she ran for local council and served one term before being elected as reeve in 1960. In 1966, East York merged with Leaside and Davidson emerged as the winner in a runoff election for mayor against Leaside's reeve, Beth Nealson. Davidson stayed on as mayor for six years until she retired in 1972. Davidson was inspired to join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She ran twice as a candidate for the party losing both times. She left the party after the CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party of Canada. In 1971 she ran for the Liberals in the 1971 provincial election but lost to incumbent Arthur Meen. In the last six years of her life she concentrated on writing a twice weekly column for the Toronto Sun and also focused her efforts on environmental conservation. She died in 1978 at the age of 77. Early life Davidson, about 30 years old Davidson was born in Hudson, Quebec, in 1901. Her father, John Wilson Davidson was a Methodist minister. Her mother, Mary Elfeda Pomeroy, was the daughter of a Methodist minister. She had a younger sister named Marsh. At the time of her death she had two nephews, Michael and David Cobden. In 1917, she attended Victoria College (now part of the University of Toronto) when it was still in Cobourg, Ontario, starting at the age of 16. She earned her BA there and then went to the Regina Normal School where she obtained a teaching certificate. She taught English and History in Strasbourg, Saskatchewan and Brandon, Manitoba. In 1923, she returned to university and received her M.A.. After that she taught history at Havergal College in Toronto. Davidson wrote children's books and for a time worked for textbook publisher J.M. Dent and Sons as a salesperson, visiting school boards across the country. She was the first female publishing sales representative in Canada. Leaving J.M. Dent in 1930, Davidson spent a year attempting to survive as a writer. During this time she wrote articles for The Globe and Mail and Chatelaine magazine. In 1931 she was hired by William Perkins Bull to coordinate the publication of a 12-volume edition of Canadiana. She worked on the project for seven years. By the time it was completed she was in charge of a staff of 70 researchers. In 1940, she moved with her parents to Streetsville, Ontario. During the move she was in a motor vehicle accident that left her father seriously injured. He died four days later. Left destitute and caring for her invalid mother, she performed odd writing jobs until in April 1941, she was appointed Clerk and Treasurer of the Village of Streetsville. She was replacing someone who had gone overseas to fight in World War II. Political career =Co-operative Commonwealth Federation= Davidson joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1934 after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She remarked about him, \\"He had a burning fire of love for people. You could warm your hands in his personality.\\" She worked for Agnes MacPhail and Arthur Williams on their election campaigns in the 1930s. She ran for the CCF in the 1953 federal election in the riding of York East coming third behind Robert McGregor.York East results, Federal election, 10 August 1953: R.H. McGregor (PC), 11,126; J.D. Thomas (L), 8,747; True Davidson (CCF), 5855; Margery Robinson (Lab- Prog), 479. She also ran provincially in the 1955 Ontario election against Hollis Beckett, again with a poor showing.York East results, Provincial election, 9 June 1955: Hollis Beckett (PC), 19,112; Royce H. Frith (L), 11,321; True Davidson (CCF), 10,990. In 1971 she recalled this period of involvement with the CCF. She said, \\"I'm not a partisan politician at all ... I ran for the CCF 15 or 16 years ago when the CCF had fallen on very stony places. I don't know why I ran. I had no thought of winning.\\" She became concerned with the direction of the party, especially after the disastrous results of the 1951 provincial election. She felt that the party was moving away from grassroots volunteers who discussed social issues with voters and was more concerned with fundraising and member recruitment. In 1952 she helped form a committee with Bill Temple, Mary Ramsay and Avis McCurdy, called the \\"Ginger Group\\". The committee met prior to the CCF provincial convention to discuss party issues. They resolved to try and nominate Bill Temple as leader against Ted Jolliffe. At the convention Temple withdrew at the last minute, allowing Jolliffe to be acclaimed. Davidson and Temple were subsequently elected to the executive as vice-presidents. In 1954 Davidson walked out of a party conference that called for parties in municipal politics. She felt that party politics should stay out of local councils. After that she became more involved in local politics and drifted away from the party. When the CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961 to form the New Democratic Party (NDP), she refused to join due to its partnership with the unions. She said, \\"I never joined the NDP. I didn't like the NDP from the beginning. I came to believe that socialism wouldn't cure the ills of the world. I couldn't see it.\\" =East York= Davidson in 1971, wearing one of her trademark hats Davidson moved to East York in 1947 after the death of her mother. Shortly after moving she was diagnosed with cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Feeling that she had not much time left Davidson immersed herself in community issues. It turned out that the cancer diagnosis was incorrect but she continued her involvement. She established a neighbourhood kindergarten which led to her being elected as a school trustee in 1948. In 1952 she became the first woman to chair the East York Board of Education. In 1958, she was elected to East York's town council. In 1960 she ran for the position of Reeve of the Township of East York against incumbent Jack Allen. The main issue at the time was uncontrolled development on land bordering the Don Valley beside Bayview Avenue. The development, later dubbed the Bayview Ghost, was a rallying cry for her campaign. She beat Allen by 5,065 votes to 3,458. Davidson was a dedicated politician, often attending community meetings, up to 40 per month. She was also a formidable debater, with an abrupt and abrasive style that annoyed her fellow council members. Yet the voters loved her and she was re-elected six times. In 1966, East York was amalgamated with the Town of Leaside, and Davidson found herself pitted against Leaside mayor Beth Nealson in an election dubbed the \\"Battle of the Belles\\" to become the first mayor of the newly amalgamated Borough of East York. ‚ÄúIf you want someone beautiful and elegant, or glamorous, I'm not that‚Äù, Davidson said during the campaign. Despite spending the final days of the campaign in a hospital recovering from a heart attack, she won the election handily. After amalgamation, Davidson was still mindful of local sentiment towards the neighbourhood name of Leaside, and, while not making it official, insisted that the name 'Leaside' be retained for any public building or space. As mayor of East York, she sought to unite the new community by starting a centennial project. Her goal was the restoration of Todmorden Mills as a heritage museum. Despite mounting costs she reached her goal by raising funds through centennial grants and from private donations. The museum was opened on 22 May 1967. She remained an honorary curator until her death. Davidson also started and served as the first director of the East York Foundation in 1966, which was created with a goal of preserving cultural holdings and artifacts. Another of Davidson's lasting achievements was the founding of the \\"East York Dominion Day Parade\\". The 1 July celebration was first started in 1957 even before she joined the council in 1958. The parade is a local tradition, and even in post- amalgamation Toronto, it continues to be held annually. Davidson had a reputation for never mincing words. She would always say what was on her mind. When she ran for reeve in 1960 she called one of her opponents, Leslie Saunders, \\"bigoted, pigheaded and, in his attitude to women, a throwback to the stone age\\". During the East York mayoralty race in 1966 she called Beth Nealson a \\"wish-washy, prissy, sweetheart\\". Metro chairman Fred Gardiner once complained that she had \\"taken a yard\\" off his back. Davidson replied that he still had plenty of hide left to spare. She referred to Metro chairman Albert Campbell as a \\"maundering chairman, inclined to regard other councillors as grade one dunces ruled by himself as schoolmaster.\\" In one exchange with Campbell, she retorted \\"Don't be addled man. Don't talk stupid!\\" Nevertheless, she had her supporters. Fellow Metro councillor, Bill Kilbourn spoke fondly of her. \\"Decent, fearless, independent. True was a thorn in the flesh of the smooth men at Metro (council).\\" In 1971 during her last term as mayor she made the surprising announcement that she wished to run as a Liberal in the next provincial election. She was nominated as the Liberal candidate in the riding of York East. She said she ran because she was frustrated by the way the Conservative government was treating municipalities. She said \\"The municipalities can't go on taking more and more responsibilities and having less and less resources given them by a provincial government which is as whimsical as a 15-year-old girl with her first beau.\\" During the election campaign she received a lot of press coverage but it focused on her age (then 70) and a certain perceived parochial attitude. Her small town persona carried well in the municipal world, but did not translate well to provincial politics. She lost badly to the Conservative incumbent Arthur Meen.York East results, Provincial election, 21 October 1971: Arthur Meen (PC), 17295; True Davidson (L), 9,751; B. Eastman (NDP), 7,050. Retirement and death Davidson retired from politics in 1972. She continued to remain involved by writing a twice-weekly column on local affairs for the Toronto Sun. She also wrote occasionally for the Toronto Star and provided commentaries for CBC Radio.In 1973 she published a book called The Golden Strings. Many had expected this to be an autobiography but instead she wrote about people whose lives had inspired her. One of the activities she focused on was her interest in environmentalism. She continued to serve as a member of the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). As reeve, one of her first acts had been to donate of land in the Don Valley to the TRCA, because she said that the borough did not have the funds to properly manage it. She stated her environmental beliefs as, \\"...prudent ecological management which the wise and far-seeing tell us is absolutely necessary for the future of the race.\\" Davidson used some of her free time to travel to Europe and Australia. On one of her trips she had an accidental fall and an x-ray revealed a cancerous growth. She was diagnosed with cancer and died at Toronto East General Hospital on 18 September 1978. Honours and legacy True Davidson House in East York. When Davidson retired from East York politics the borough named a senior's residence after her, the True Davidson Acres. In 1971 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Victoria College as a Doctor of Sacred Letters. Davidson was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1973, received the Queen's Jubilee Medal in 1977 and, just before her death in 1978, was awarded an honorary doctorate from York University, where she had recently enrolled as a doctoral student in Canadian literature. After her death, the \\"True Davidson Collection of Canadian Literature\\" was established at York University, based on a donation of her personal papers. In 1997, just before amalgamation, one of the last acts of the East York Council was to rename the meeting place as the True Davidson Council Chamber. In the late 1990s, a new residential development was built on the same lands as the Bayview Ghost. In 1999 the East York Community Council named one of the new streets of the development \\"True Davidson Drive\\" in honour of her impact on the area. In 2001, the city designated her former residence at 203 Woodmount Avenue as \\"True Davidson House\\". Her first house in East York was on Linnsmore Crescent but she had moved to Woodmount Avenue and spent the majority of her time here. The local Meals on Wheels agency is named for her, as is a park near Coxwell Avenue and Cosburn Avenue.

Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). He prevailed, but only after a 14-year battle that saw the case go before the Supreme Court, which ruled that as a private figure Gertz did not have to prove actual malice on the defendants' part.Gertz v.

Early life A Jew of Lithuanian descent, Gertz was born to Morris and Grace Gertz in Chicago's Maxwell Street neighborhood. He attended elementary school with future Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg.Mark E. Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). At the age of ten, his mother dead and his father unable to care for his children, he spent the remainder of his childhood in orphanages in Chicago and Cleveland.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights); Mark E. Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). Education He graduated from Crane Technical High School, where he made the acquaintance of other young men who would become famous in their own right: authors Meyer Levin and Leo Rosten and newspaper magnate Leo Lerner. Afterwards, he attended the University of Chicago and its law school.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). He received his J.D. degree in 1930 and went to work in the firm of the well-connected Jacob Arvey.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). He would remain there for another 14 years.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). He remained involved in education throughout his life, teaching a civil rights class at The John Marshall Law School until his death in 2000.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). Legal career As a law student, Gertz had been inspired by Clarence Darrow's famous argument against the death penalty in the Leopold-Loeb trial. He himself achieved national fame when he won parole for Nathan Leopold, the surviving half of the infamous thrill- killing duo, in 1958. He made a point of walking out of the prison gates with his client. He and Miller became good friends after he persuaded a court to lift the ban on Tropic of Cancer, a decision the Supreme Court upheld in 1964's Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein. In the mid-1960s, Gertz emulated his legal inspiration, Clarence Darrow, when he argued against the death sentence handed down to Jack Ruby for killing Lee Harvey Oswald. It was overturned, and Ruby, who was terminally ill, served the remaining few years of his life in prison. Educator In addition to his law practice, Elmer Gertz was an adjunct professor teaching Civil Rights Law at The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, where he taught classes in civil rights. Libel suit against John Birch Society In 1969, Elmer Gertz represented the family of a young man killed by a Chicago police officer. This drew the ire of the John Birch Society, which alleged in an article about the case in its magazine, American Opinion, that he had a criminal record and was part of a Communist conspiracy to discredit local police departments in order to pave the way for Communist control by a national police force. He sued the Society for defamation and won a $500,000 judgment. On appeal, the case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which was asked to settle the question of whether or not Gertz was a public figure, who would thus have to prove actual malice to win (which he probably could not have). In 1974, the Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that he was not a public figure and that states were free to set their own standards for libel when they were alleged by a private figure.Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974). Ironically, given his successes in fighting censorship, some of the dissenting justices and other commentators have viewed his victory as limiting First Amendment rights. The case went back to a six- day trial where Gertz once again prevailed and was awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages.Mark E. Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the award and the U.S. Supreme Court declined further review.Gertz v. Robert Welch, 680 F.2d 527 (7th Cir. 1982); Mark E. Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). A few years later, Gertz and his wife went on a round-the- world, luxury cruise with the money he won and sent \\"wish you were here\\" postcards back to Welch and his organization every chance they got.; Mark E. Wojcik, \\"The Elmer Gertz Award,\\" Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 2, at 6 (Dec. 2013)(Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). Political and social activism In the 1940s, he was active in the fair housing movement, serving on several public bodies devoted to the subject. He presciently warned against the creation of large housing projects, advocating a more scattered approach instead. He also campaigned for the admission of African Americans to the local bar association.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). In 1969, he was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention, where he chaired the committee on its Bill of Rights,Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). working closely with the committee's legal counsel, Dallin H. Oaks. It has been called the strongest bill of rights of any state constitution at that point in time. A decade later, he chaired the equivalent committees of the Illinois and Chicago bar associations. He also served as chairman of the Lawyers' Association. After his death, the Illinois State Bar Association created the Elmer Gertz Lawyer Award in 2000 to recognize lawyers for their exceptional dedication to protecting civil liberties.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights). Elmer Gertz received Israel's Prime Minister's Medal in 1972 for his service on that country's behalf, and considered that his finest accomplishment.Thomas Bruno, Elmer Gertz Award, Human Rights, vol. 40, no. 1, at 7 (Newsletter of the Illinois State Bar Association Section on Human Rights); Mark E.

Location Lake Palcacocha in 1939 Palcacocha is located at in the Ancash Region in Cordillera Blanca at an elevation of 4,566 m, just below the summits of Palcaraju (6,274 m) and Pucaranra (6,156 m). The lake is one of several lakes supplying the town Huaraz with water, 23 km to the southwest. Palcacocha in 2001 Palcacocha in 2003 1941 mudflow On the early morning of 13 December 1941 a huge chunk of the adjacent glacier or a large avalanche fell into Lake Palcacocha causing the breaking of the moraine walls that limit the lake downhill. The wave hurtled down the Cojup valley, destroying Lake Jiracocha on its way and carrying blocks of ice, large rock boulders and liquid mud towards the Santa River valley. Within 15 minutes the mudslide reached Huaraz, with 400 m¬≥ of debris burying parts of the town and killing approximately 1,800 to 7,000 inhabitants. The outburst is estimated to have reduced the volume of the lake from about 10 million cubic metres to half a million. In 1974 drainage structures were built to maintain the level eight metres below the height of the damming moraine in order to protect against overtopping in the event of an avalanche or ice fall into the lake. But an adjacent glacier to the lake has receded since the incident increasing the size of the lake. Also because of climate changing melting the glacier the lake's water input has also increased dramatically since the disaster. By 2009 its volume was about 17 million cubic metres. Recent developments In April 2003, NASA scientists discovered a fissure in the glacier above Lake Palcacocha on Terra satellite images of November 2001. Their warnings reached Peru just two weeks after the staff of the UGRH (Unidad de Glaciologia y Recursos Hidricos) had done some field mapping of Lake Palcacocha, where a moraine rupture had caused a minor flood on 19 March 2003 which the safety constructions from the 1940s had captured. According to research done by scientists of the Innsbruck university in Austria, the ensuing panic among the inhabitants and economic damage to Huaraz' tourism industry could have been prevented, as from their findings the NASA warnings were a misinterpretation of satellite data. The water volume of Lake Palcacocha has increased significantly in recent years. According to a study by the University of Texas at Austin, the city of Huaraz faces a high risk of flooding from the lake.Animations and images for the current flood risk based on scientific studies from the University of Texas at Austin The volume has grown 34 times since 1970, leading to the declaration of several states of emergency.United States Agency for International Development (USAID): The Glacial Lake Handbook. Reducing Risk from Dangerous Glacial Lakes in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru At the same time, the population of Huaraz has increased from 25 000 in 1941 to around 100 000, many of whom live in the area that was previously flooded. In 2010 the UGRH presented plans to lower the water level by 15 meters to decrease the risk of flooding. At the same time, the national government rescinded responsibility for glacier lakes from the UGRH and transferred it to the regional authorities. Since the regional authorities did not come up with the funds to implement the measures proposed by the UGRH, six drainpipes were installed in 2011 which reduced the water level by three meters by July 2013. Worldwide responsibility In March 2015, a citizen of Huaraz who is affected by the risk of flooding, Sa√∫l Luciano Lliuya, shifted global interest to the situation at Lake Palcacocha when he sent a letter to the German utility company RWE in which he held them partially accountable for the situation.Peruvian farmer demands climate compensation from German company In: The Guardian, 16.

Here, curvature refers to the sectional curvature of a space (more precisely a manifold) and is a single number determining its local geometry. The sectional curvature is said to be constant if it has the same value at every point and for every two-dimensional tangent plane at that point. For example, a sphere is a surface of constant positive curvature. Classification The Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature can be classified into the following three cases: * elliptic geometry ‚Äì constant positive sectional curvature * Euclidean geometry ‚Äì constant vanishing sectional curvature * hyperbolic geometry ‚Äì constant negative sectional curvature. Properties * Every space of constant curvature is locally symmetric, i.e. its curvature tensor is parallel abla \\\\mathrm{R}=0. * Every space of constant curvature is locally maximally symmetric, i.e. it has \\\\frac{1}{2} n (n+1) number of local isometries, where n is its dimension. * Conversely, there exists a similar but stronger statement: every maximally symmetric space, i.e. a space which has \\\\frac{1}{2} n (n+1) (global) isometries, has constant curvature. * (Killing‚ÄìHopf theorem) The universal cover of a manifold of constant sectional curvature is one of the model spaces: ** sphere (sectional curvature positive) ** plane (sectional curvature zero) ** hyperbolic manifold (sectional curvature negative) * A space of constant curvature which is geodesically complete is called space form and the study of space forms is intimately related to generalized crystallography (see the article on space form for more details). * Two space forms are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension, their metrics possess the same signature and their sectional curvatures are equal.

The shoe design includes a support system feature, which is an arrangement of small hollow columns in the midsole supporting the shoe's heel, which are made primarily with polyurethane. There are different formations of the shox technology, but most models include four circular columns in a square formation to provide cushioning. Later variations in shox models added one or two additional shox, 25 mm high, though they may vary in height; as well as triangular and rectangular shox that Nike claims provide better stability. Some shoes have midsoles made entirely of Shox, like the TL and VC series. Overview Nike claims that Shox not only absorb impact from heel strike while running, but also claims they \\"spring back\\" and add more power to a runner's stride. Aside from this alleged boost in speed, the Shox is supposed to provide superior shock absorption with high-tech elastic foam. The newer Shox series is compatible with \\"Nike+ technology.\\" The Nike Shox Saya+ is the most recent Shox with this feature. The new Nike Shox Q'Vida Hi shoe is a new woman's \\"dance boot\\" implementation of Shox. Actor Hugh Laurie of Fox's House is said to have 37 pairs of size 12¬Ω Shox that he wears on the show and off set. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld is also a fan of, and wears Nike Shox.\\"New York Times: Jerry Seinfeld Intends to Die Standing Up\\" Some of Nike‚Äôs best selling shoes include Shox, like the Shox NZ and Shox Turbo, which are available in different colors. These shoes can be found for customization on NikeID, Nike's online shoe customizing site. There are numerous options like different colors and materials for the Shox, along with custom tags. On February 17, 2006, BBC News reported that Nike had filed a patent infringement suit against rival Adidas, claiming that a range of their trainers replicated its technology. Timeline In 1984, designer Bruce Kilgore began researching the Shox project design. Inspiration for the shoe is said to have come from viewing indoor track sprinters appear to \\"bounce\\" after impacting the surface of the track. Nike developers experimented with many materials that were unable to provide the runner with sufficient support and also returning a small portion of energy to the runner following impact with the ground. Ultimately, polyurethane was developed as the key component to the Shox system success. =2000= Black and gold Nike Shox Nike released the first Shox based shoe. The shoe attracted considerable excitement due in part to the timing of its release. The new millennium energized consumers with hopes for new technologies, which contributed heavily to Nike Shox' early success.https://www.sneakerfiles.com/nike/nike-running/nike-shox-r4/ During the 2000 Summer Olympics, the brand saw a tremendous boost in popularity when Team USA's Vince Carter dunked over a 7'2\\" center from Team France in a pair of Shox BB4 (his first signature shoe with Nike). https://theathletic.com/1426671/2019/12/06/maybe-it-was-the-shoes-the-legacy- of-vince-carters-nike-shox/?source=user_shared_article Carter's dunk would become a major influence on Shox' advertisement strategy.https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/12/16871864/nike-shox-release- return-vince-carter-2000 =2004= The release of two popular Shox basketball shoes, the Nike Shox Explosive and the Nike Shox Elevate.

Founded in 1890, the company maintains existing and installs new landscaping for commercial, government, and residential customers. The company has about 200 employees. It was based in Portland until the 1940s, then in the unincorporated Cedar Mill area until 2007. Its headquarters have been in eastern Hillsboro since fall 2011. History Gustav Teufel founded the nursery company in 1890 in the West Hills of Portland. Later, and for about 60 years, the company also operated a large wholesale nursery on Barnes Road, in the Cedar Mill area, acquiring the property in 1946 and moving its headquarters to that site. The company closed its operation in Cedar Mill in 2007, when the approximately property was sold for redevelopment, and moved its headquarters back to its original West Hills site, on Miller Road in Portland. In September 1997, the Portland Business Journal reported that Terry Thornton, a former sales manager of the \\"Wholesale Horticultural Supplies Division\\" of Teufel Nurseries, was installed as the 62nd president of the Oregon Association of Nurserymen (now called the Oregon Association of Nurseries). The Oregonian reported that Teufel Nursery, in partnership with Pivot Landscape Architecture and Cistus Nursery, installed a green roof on the M Financial Center in the Pearl District of downtown Portland in 2009. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as well as filing a countersuit in June 2009 when its primary lender, Textron, sued for immediate payment on a $5.9 million note after the drop in the housing market and the recession reduced revenues from a high of $45 million annually in 2006 to around $32 million projected. Teufel, while still being solvent and profitable, experienced difficulties securing new creditors and decided to operate on a cash-only basis and scale back its operations, liquidating a portion of its assets in 2010. Before entering bankruptcy, the company employed more than 500. In June 2011, Teufel repaid its major creditors in full. Operations Headquarters in Hillsboro in 2013 Teufel Nursery is currently owned and managed by Gustav's great grandchildren Larry, Linda and Tina Teufel. Significant customers of the company have included OHSU, Portland Rose Garden, Bonneville Power Administration, Microsoft, the Portland World Trade Center, and the White House.Green party takes over the White House The Teufel family also owns and operates Teufel Holly Farms, Inc. which sells holly and evergreens during the winter season and supplies holiday wreaths and garlands for the annual Oregon Episcopal School Christmas Wreath & Holiday Greens Sale.OES - Christmas Wreath & Holiday Green Sale The company was still based in Portland in mid-2011, but it relocated its headquarters in fall 2011 to the Tanasbourne area of Hillsboro, Oregon, on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area.

Despite losing his fingers and toes to frostbite while lost at sea in a dory in 1883, he prospered as a Gloucester, Massachusetts businessman. Yearning for adventure, he twice sailed single-handed across the Atlantic Ocean, overcoming his disability and setting record times for the crossing.  History  Howard Blackburn was born in Port Medway, Nova Scotia in 1859. At the age of 18, he moved south to Massachusetts, seeking work as a fisherman, and became part of the Gloucester, Massachusetts fishing community. Blackburn first rose to fame in 1883. While he was fishing on the schooner Grace L. Fears, a sudden winter storm caught him and a dorymate unprepared while they were in their Banks dory, leaving them separated from the schooner. Blackburn began to row for shore, despite the loss of his mittens; he knew his hands would freeze, so he kept them in the hooked position that would allow him to row. He tried to save one hand with a sock and thus worsened his condition by freezing his toes and yet not being able to save his fingers. The crewmate gave up and lay down in the dory and died on the second day. Blackburn carried the body to shore for a proper burial. After five days with virtually no food, water, or sleep, he made it to shore in Newfoundland. Blackburn's hands were treated for frostbite, but could not be saved; he lost all of his fingers, and many of his toes, and both thumbs to the first joint. Blackburn returned to Gloucester a hero, and with the help of the town, managed to establish a successful saloon. Not content with this, he organised an expedition to the Klondike to join the gold rush; rather than go overland, he and his group sailed there, via Cape Horn. Howard, after a disagreement with his partners left the group in San Francisco after a short trip to Portland, Oregon to buy lumber to help finance the trip, and returned home never having panned for gold. After the quest for gold failed, Blackburn turned his attention to a new challenge ‚Äî to sail single-handed across the Atlantic Ocean. This had been done before, by Alfred \\"Centennial\\" Johnson in 1876, and Joshua Slocum had completed a single-handed circumnavigation in 1898; but for a man with no fingers to undertake such a voyage would be quite an accomplishment. He sailed from Gloucester, Massachussetts in 1899, in the modified Gloucester Fishing Sloop, Great Western, and reached the city of Goucester, England after 62 days at sea. Returning to Gloucester, Massachussetts, Blackburn continued to prosper as a businessman; but he still hankered for adventure. In 1901, he sailed to Portugal in the twenty-five-foot Gloucester Fishing sloop Great Republic, making the trip in 39 days. In 1903 he again set out alone, this time in the sailing dory America, but was defeated by bad weather. Blackburn also circumnavigated the Eastern United States by going down the Mississippi River and back up the Eastern Seaboard. The Sloop \\"Great Republic\\" and the Dory \\"America\\" may be seen at the Cape Ann Museum, in Gloucester. Blackburn died in 1932; his funeral was attended by many of the people of Gloucester. He was buried in the Fishermen's Rest section of Beechbrook Cemetery.  Memorial race  Today, the Blackburn Challenge is held annually. It is a 20-mile open- water race circumnavigating Cape Ann open to all human-powered craft. July 25, 2019 was the 33rd running of the Blackburn Challenge.  Blackburn Tavern still stands  The building that was the home of the Blackburn Tavern still stands at 289 Main Street in Gloucester. Vincent Cove that at high tide came to the back door of the tavern has since been filled in but the building is largely unchanged.

Located at the Museumplein are three major museums ‚Äì the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum ‚Äì and the concert hall Concertgebouw. The area was originally a wax candle factory and marshy meadows. Construction began following the completion of the Rijksmuseum in 1885, with a street plan based on the design of Pierre Cuypers, the museum's celebrated architect.

The Museumplein was reconstructed after a design by the Swedish/Danish landscape architect Sven-Ingvar Andersson in 1999. It now includes underground parking spaces and an underground supermarket. In the winter, the pond can be transformed into an artificial ice skating area. The space is also used for (mass) events such as festivals, celebrations, and demonstrations and Armin Van Buuren honoured The Dutch Team at Museumplein in 2010 by playing Swedish House Mafia.

However, most gesneriad specialists have not accepted his segregation of Bucinellina, Dalbergaria, Pentadenia, and Trichantha from Columnea, and his new genus Parakohleria has been synonymized under Pearcea. His rare instances of taxonomic \\"lumping\\" have not been as widely accepted; Gloxinia sensu Wiehler is a polyphyletic assemblage, recently dismembered, and no other botanists have accepted his synonymy of Rhytidophyllum and Pheidonocarpa under Gesneria.

The film features scenes of Dr. Moog interacting with various musical artists who view Moog as an influential figure in the history of electronic music. Moog is not a comprehensive history of electronic music nor does it serve as a chronological history of the development of the Moog synthesizer. There is no narration, rather the scenes feature candid conversation and interviews that serve more as a tribute to Moog than a documentary. The film was shot on location in Hollywood, New York, Tokyo, and Asheville, North Carolina where Moog's company is based. Additional concert performances were filmed in London and San Francisco.

The organization is committed to the advancement of innovative positions in architecture, art and design.  Background  The organization was founded in 1982 by Kyong Park with R.L. Seltman and Arleen Schloss in a tiny storefront at 51 Prince Street, \\"to support the idea that art and design have the potential and responsibility to affect public policies which influence the quality of life and future of all cities.‚Äù With co-director Glenn Weiss (1984-86), Storefront implemented its \\"civic dialogue and activist\\" project format and moved Storefront to its location at Kenmare Street. The artist Shirin Neshat co-directed Storefront with her husband Kyong Park until the mid 1990s, and Park was the Executive Director from its founding until 1998. At its outset, Storefront balanced solo or group exhibitions with ideas competitions and exhibitions to functionally and/or poetically address NYC issues with social implications. Early topics addressed include the polluted Gowanus Canal in 1983, New York City Homeless Shelters in 1985, preservation of Adam Purple's \\"Garden on Eden\\" in 1984, and removal of Richard Serra's \\"Tilted Arc\\" in 1985. At the beginning, Storefront hosted solo or group exhibitions that functionally and/or poetically addressed NYC issues with social implications including the polluted Gowanus Canal'83, NYC Homeless Shelters '85‚Äì86, preservation of Adam Purple's \\"Garden on Eden\\" '84 and removal of Richard Serra's \\"Tilted Arc\\" '85.

The 1987 exhibition \\"Bodybuildings\\" was the first solo show of the New York-based architecture practice Diller + Scofidio. In 1993 Storefront commissioned a collaboration between artist Vito Acconci and architect Steven Holl to redesign the facade of the Kenmare Street gallery space. The resulting project transformed the structure by placing rotating panels of various orientation along the length of the gallery's facade. When the panels are open the design is meant to blur the border between the gallery and the street in order to create a dialogue between the experimental projects being exhibited inside and the city outside. Though the original design was only intended to last for two years, the unique architecture has stuck around since its completion in 1993. The facade underwent restoration in the summer of 2008. In 2006‚Äì2007, the exhibition ‚ÄúClip/Stamp/Fold: The Radical Architecture of Little Magazines,‚Äù organized by architectural historian and curator Beatriz Colomina, addressed the important role of independent architecture publications in the architectural movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The Pop-Up exhibition \\"CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed\\" was held in an unused portion of a print shop on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles from April 11 to May 17 2008, and featured Fr√©d√©ric Chaubin's photographs of late Soviet architecture. In 2009, the Spacebuster, a portable, expandable pavilion designed by Raumlabor to transform public spaces of all kinds into points for community gathering, traveled throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn for 10 consecutive evenings hosting various community events. In 2011, Storefront responded to the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City by calling for public submissions of ideas for improving communication with economic and political powers. In 2012, Storefront teamed up with design studios Family New York and PlayLab to help add exposure for the +POOL project, as part of the Storefront Starter initiative. A series of talks, \\"Postopolis!,\\" were held in New York (2007), Los Angeles (2009) and Mexico City (2010) reflect about the current state of cities and design practices. In 2014, the Storefront led the project \\"Letters to The Mayor,\\" which Domus journal described as \\"a program designed to highlight the sometimes overlooked relationship between architects and local political authorities, and to facilitate new conversations between them.\\" Several exhibition have specifically worked with the Acconci/Holl facade as a key element of design, including SO-IL‚Äôs design for the ‚ÄúBlueprint‚Äù exhibition, and Abruzzo Bodziak Architects‚Äô design for the exhibition ‚ÄúArchitecture Books‚ÄîYet to be Written,‚Äù the anchor program for the 2018 New York Architecture Book Fair. In 2017, Storefront founded the New York Architectural Book Fair, which consisted of a series of salons in private libraries, an exhibition at Storefront‚Äôs gallery space, and a network of pop-up architecture book collections in partnership with local bookstores and cultural organizations.  Description  Exterior view of the gallery during an exhibit. Storefront is located in a triangular ground-level space on 97 Kenmare Street in Soho, NY. Nearly 100 feet long, the gallery tapers from 20 feet to 3 feet at its west end. Storefront's programming includes exhibitions, events (performances, artists talks, film screenings, conferences), competitions and publications. = Exhibitions = Exhibitions have ranged from single artist site-specific installations to thematic group shows that have addressed issues from new technology to the social and political forces that shape the built environment. = Discussions = Storefront also provides a forum for discussion of contemporary issues through book discussions, film screenings or performances with a goal to expose innovative ideas. Examples of artists and architects that have participated in Storefront events include Bernard Tschumi, Hilary Sample, Peter Cook, Mark Wigley, Jenny Sabin, Oana Stanescu, Bryony Roberts, Tatiana Bilbao, Mabel Wilson, Meejin Yoon, Juergen Mayer, Jimenez Lai, Rosalyne Shieh, Jing Liu (architect), Mitchell Joachim, and Saskia Sassen. = Competitions = Storefront has also held a series of competitions with the aim to address relevant issues within contemporary culture. In 1985 within the exhibition \\"Homeless at Home\\" a call for designs asked for the projection of alternative housing models for homeless in New York. In 1985, \\"Before the Whitney\\" asked for alternative designs for the Whitney Museum. In 2008 \\"White House Redux\\" asked for alternative designs of the White House. In 2010, Total Housing asked for new typologies of inhabitation that addressed outmoded ideas of domestic space and contemporary urban lifestyles. In 2011, on the occasion of the Festival of Ideas for the New City, \\"StreetFest\\" asked for alternative models of temporary outdoor spaces for public occupation and gathering.

Taller starters are more effective than shorter ones. In empirical studies of lighting cones for Haitian charcoal stoves (which are placed over a grate rather than having an integrated grate), the ignition time and charcoal consumption were halved compared to lighting on a shallow bed grate, and carbon monoxide production was reduced by 40%. The cone also protected the charcoal from the wind, and helped direct the smoke away from users.Kathleen Lask, Ashok Gadgil, \\"Performance and emissions characteristics of a lighting cone for charcoal stoves\\", Energy for Sustainable Development, 36:64‚Äì67 (February 2017),  Using a chimney starter  The chimney starter is used by placing kindling‚Äîtypically paper‚Äîunder the grate and charcoal over it. When the kindling is lit, it ignites the charcoal and creates a draft. Since the coals are held together, radiation heats adjacent coals, and convection heats coals higher in the stack. Once all the charcoal is burning (glowing red on the bottom and ashed over on the top), the chimney is lifted by its handle and the burning charcoal dumped into the grill. If some burning charcoal remains in the chimney, adding new charcoal will quickly ignite it.  Cooking  One can also cook directly over the chimney starter with an additional top grate. This provides high-intensity heat for fast searing.Transcript of Good Eats episode Wednesday, 22 August 2018 Japanese Fire starter See also * Charcoal lighter fluid, another fire starting aid * Electric charcoal starter  References  Category:Tools Category:Charcoal Category:Barbecue ","title":"Chimney starter"},{"id":"3638903","text":"Ahl's Independent Company, Heavy Artillery (officially known as the 1st Delaware Heavy Artillery) was a heavy artillery battery that served in the Union army in the American Civil War.

Arundell was connected by birth and marriage to the crown and to several of the most important families in England, and by the time of the death of King Henry VIII was one of the most experienced government officers in England. Those in power had concerns with his influence and his family's devotion to the old religion. Vague and unproven allegations of complicity in the south-western rebellion in 1549 were made against him. In late 1551 he temporarily aligned himself with the Protector Somerset, thereby putting himself in conflict with John Dudley, Earl of Warwick.

His property was confiscated, but in June 1552 the Crown began restoring it to his widow and, from 1553, to his son. Biography Thomas Arundell, born about 1502, was the younger of the two sons of Sir John Arundell (1474‚Äì1545) of Lanherne, St. Mawgan-in-Pyder, Cornwall, Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall and \\"the most important man in the county\\", by his first wife, Lady Eleanor Grey (d. by December 1503), the daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset. Arundell was educated at Lincoln's Inn, and began his career in the household of Cardinal Wolsey, where he was a contemporary of Thomas Cromwell. He was knighted at the coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn.\\"Arundell, Sir Thomas (c.1502‚Äì52)\\", The History of Parliament Arundell held a number of administrative positions, principally in the West Country. He was the first receiver of the Court of Augmentations for Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset, and in 1533 succeeded his father as Receiver- General of the Duchy of Cornwall. He was a Justice of the Peace for Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, and was appointed to commissions for gaol delivery, oyer and terminer, and the defence of the counties of the south-west coastline. He commanded the Dorset militia during both the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536‚Äì7, and King Henry VIII's expedition to France in 1544. He was twice High Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset (1531), was keeper of the royal parks in Dorset, and in 1539 sat on the Council of the West with his father. He was elected Member of Parliament for Dorset in 1545 and 1547. Both his cousin, Henry Grey, 3rd Marquess of Dorset, and Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, employed Arundell in the management of their estates. He also served as receiver to Queen Anne of Cleves, and Chancellor of the Household to Queen Catherine Parr.. Arundell's role as one of the commissioners for the dissolution of the monasteries in the West Country enabled him to acquire a number of properties formerly belonging to religious houses. In 1547 he purchased Wardour Castle in Wiltshire. Arundell was connected by birth and marriage to the crown and to several of the most important families in England, and by the time of the death of King Henry VIII was one of the most experienced government officers in England. However, those in power at the beginning of the reign of King Edward VI removed his name from the late King's list of proposed honours, reflecting their concern with his influence and his family's devotion to the old religion. Vague and unproven allegations of complicity in the south-western rebellion in 1549 were made against him and against his brother, Sir John Arundell (c.1550‚Äì1557), leading to their imprisonment in 1550 and again in 1551, and marking the end of Sir Thomas Arundell's career. In late 1551 he temporarily aligned himself with the Protector Somerset, thereby putting himself in conflict with John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. He was arrested and charged with conspiring to overthrow the government and murder the Earl. Arundell consistently protested his innocence, but was convicted, beheaded on Tower Hill on 26 February 1552, and buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula. His property was confiscated, although in June 1552 the Crown began restoring it to his widow and, from 1553, to his son Matthew Arundell. His widow, Margaret, died 10 October 1571, and was buried at Tisbury, Wiltshire. Marriage and issue By settlement dated 20 November 1530 Arundell married Margaret Howard (c. 1515 ‚Äì 10 October 1571), the daughter of Lord Edmund Howard (third son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney), and Joyce Culpeper.

He had distant connection with William Hogarth, whose father was also born Hoggarth. Biography Paul Hogarth was born in Kendal, Cumbria, and aged 6 moved in 1923 with his family to Manchester. He attended the Manchester School of Art from 1934 to 1936, where he became involved in the Artists' International Association and the Communist Party of Great Britain. After 1936 he attended Saint Martin's School of Art in London, and drove lorries in the Spanish Civil War for the International Brigade. Paul Hogarth was a painter with a talent for illustration and reportage, which was allied to his love of travel. This led him to produce drawings and watercolours recording events and places all over the world. As an illustrator he studied under James Boswell, and worked with a number of eminent authors, including Robert Graves, Graham Greene, Brendan Behan, Lawrence Durrell, and William Golding. He illustrated the New Penguin Shakespeare series of paperbacks in the 1970s, and his work can also be seen on the cover of John Wyndham's 'The Midwich Cuckoos' (1964, Penguin ). He was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1974, a full member in 1984; and was awarded the OBE in 1989. His work is held in collections worldwide, and he exhibited regularly in the Francis Kyle Gallery in London. Hogarth died on 27 December 2001(age 84). At the time of his death he had been married to actress Diana Hogarth (stage name Diana Robson) for 12 years.

She was married to Walter Midgley, the international operatic tenor. Her daughter Maryetta Midgley and her son Vernon Midgley became widely acclaimed singers in their own right. As a small child she showed amazing talent for the piano, and began to win prizes from the age of 5, becoming the youngest ever (aged 14) to sit for her L.R.A.M. But she never wished to be in the spotlight. Walter and Gladys met when they were both performing in The Fol-De-Rols at the White Rock Theater, Hastings. After they were married, war broke out, and it was six years before Walter was able to take up the contract at Covent Garden offered to him by Thomas Beecham. Assuming Walter knew all the leading tenor roles, C.G. gave him his debut as Calaf in Turandot, but this meant that Gladys had to coach Walter in the role - and all subsequent roles which followed his successful debut. Her part in the Midgley household was paramount. Whilst all the others performed to much acclaim, Gladys stayed in the background. Walter died in 1980 but Gladys died in 2005 aged 94. She also left a granddaughter, Juliet, and a great-granddaughter, Fritha.

Coryell (6 Fed. Cas. 546, no. 3,230 C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823) was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court decided by Justice Bushrod Washington, sitting by designation as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In it, he upheld a New Jersey regulation forbidding non-residents from gathering oysters and clams against a challenge that New Jersey's law violated the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause and that the New Jersey law regulated interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. Decision The most-cited aspect of Corfield v. Coryell is Justice Washington's listing of the \\"privileges and immunities\\" enjoyed by citizens of the United States: Influence on Fourteenth Amendment The well- known passage from Corfield was quoted in reference to the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment (substantially authored by John Bingham), during congressional debates on the Amendment, for an indication of what the judiciary had interpreted the phrase \\"privileges and immunities\\" to mean as it stood in the original Constitution (Article 4 Section 2), but there is substantial evidence to the effect that some congressmen, at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, did not accept Justice Washington's reading of the term. Justice Washington's assessment is often cited by those who advocate a broader reading of the Fourteenth Amendment Privileges or Immunities Clause than the Supreme Court gave in the Slaughter-House Cases.

Life Murrough O'Brien was born in 1726 to the Hon. James O' Brien and Mary Jephson in Drogheda. James' brother (and Murrough's uncle) was Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond, whose heir was Percy Wyndham O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond (c. 1713 ‚Äì 1774), brother of Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont (1710‚Äì1763) of Petworth House. He joined the Grenadier Guards and was an officer in Germany, where he carried colours at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747. He retired in 1756 and entered the Irish House of Commons for Clare in the following year. He represented the constituency until 1761 and sat then as Member of Parliament (MP) for Harristown until 1768. Because of his support for the Act of Union of Great Britain and Ireland, on 29 December 1800 he was created Marquess of Thomond in the Peerage of Ireland, with a special remainder to his younger brother, and Baron Thomond, of Taplow Court in the County of Buckingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 2 October 1801 (which title allowed him to sit in the United Kingdom House of Lords), but this time with no special remainder. He had a close relationship with King George III. In 1783 he was one of the Founding Knights of the Order of St Patrick. His Irish seat was Rostellan, near Cork. He was a drinker, called a \\"'six bottle man\\", and a gambler. He was a keen farmer and oversaw enclosure of lands around Taplow and mechanisation. Marriages and children Mary, Countess of Inchiquin (1750‚Äì1820), by Thomas Lawrence He married twice: * Firstly in 1753 to Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney (died 1790), by whom he had a daughter, Mary O'Brien, 4th Countess of Orkney (1755‚Äì1831). * Secondly on 25 July 1792, to Mary Palmer (1750-1820) He also is reputed to have had an illegitimate son, Thomas Carter (1769‚Äì1800), who was a composer in London during the 1790s. Thomas lived with Inchiquin at Taplow Court after his return from India in July 1789, and lent the earl all the money he earned in a benefit concert in Calcutta. In return, Inchiquin recommended Thomas to all his friends as a coal merchant; he had gone into that field after his marriage to Mary Wells in 1793 in order to support his growing family. Death & succession He died after a fall from his horse in Grosvenor Square, London on 10 February 1808. The title of Marquess of Thomond passed to his nephew William O'Brien, 2nd Marquess of Thomond. The barony of Thomond became extinct.

It is adjusted to different pipe diameters by rotating the key ring. Its advantage is that it grips with significant force without needing to engage a nut. However, if used carelessly, it can dent or break the pipe. It can also be used on nuts and other flat engagement points. It works perfectly in situations where there are hexagon-shaped nuts to be adjusted. History The plumber wrench was invented in the year 1888 by Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson. His wrench shares some principles with both the Stillson-pattern pipe wrench and the rigid pipe wrench. Nevertheless, it is a decidedly different and improved tool. It allows plumbers to use the wrench rather than a pair of tongs to separate or join pipes. It is not widely known in North America, but is common in Europe. Johansson also improved the adjustable spanner, patenting in 1891.

Midgley was born in Bramley, near Rotherham. After leaving school, he worked as a clerk in a steelworks in Sheffield while learning to play musical instruments and sing in choirs during his spare time. In order to earn enough to pay for singing lessons, he formed a dance-band and eventually enrolled in the Sheffield School of Music. He auditioned for the Carl Rosa Opera Company and was engaged as a chorister, subsequently playing small parts and eventually making his debut as a principal in the role of Rodolfo in La boh√®me. Before World War II, he also sang with the Sadler's Wells company.Gladys Davidson: Opera Biographies, London, Werner Laurie, 1955. He also sang with Geraldo on BBC Radio. After the war he became Principal Tenor at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, making his debut as Calaf in Turandot. He sang major tenor roles from 1951 to 1953 but left after a difference with the management and never returned. In 1948 during Rigoletto at Covent Garden, while he was singing 'Questa o quella', Walter swallowed his false moustache. This incident made newspaper headlines all over the world and the story has become a classic. But far from being amusing, it was very worrying. Walter completed the first act and the Opera House staff were able to retrieve some of the offending article in the interval, but the next day an operation to remove the gauze was needed. For Walter it was a case of 'the show must go on' but the accident caused him much discomfort for some months after. He was married to the pianist Gladys Vernon, and his daughter Maryetta Midgley and his son Vernon Midgley became accomplished singers in their own right. He once appeared with his wife and children on the long-running BBC Radio programme \\"Friday Night is Music Night\\", the only occasion on which all four Midgleys were to perform together in public. He died in 1980 having that day completed another of his very popular Radio 2 Series, 'Walter Midgley Remembers'.  References  Sources *D.

He is known to have visited England, in 1413, buying alabaster from \\"Newcastle-on-the-Tyne\\" for Estaud d‚ÄôEstouteville, Abbot of La Trinit√© at F√©camp (1390‚Äì1423). In 1420, he was paid 200 livres tournois for a masonry tabernacle at F√©camp for the relic of the Pas de l‚Äôange or Pas au P√®lerin, an impression in sandstone of the footstep of an angel at the dedication of the 10th-century church. Although damaged, the tabernacle is the earliest extant example of Berneval's style. In Rouen, he worked for the French King in 1417 and, after the occupation of Rouen by the English in 1419, for the Duke of Bedford, who commissioned him to build a castle for Henry V. On this project he worked closely with Jenson Salvart (flourished 1398‚Äì1447), the master mason of Rouen Cathedral. In 1424, the two of them were implicated in a plot to overthrow the English by giving information about the castle to an insurgence led by Richard Mites or Ricart Mittes. Rouen Castle no longer exists. Berneval was first recorded in the accounts of the Abbey Church of Saint-Ouen in 1424 and was master there until his death. The church contains his tomb.

It served in the Eastern Theater in a variety of campaigns and battles, and is remembered with a stone memorial on the Antietam National Battlefield not far from Burnside's Bridge. The regiment later became noted for its many up-and-coming politicians. Future presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley served in this unit, as did future U.S. senator and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court Stanley Matthews and Robert P. Kennedy, a future U.S. Congressman. Other notable officers included James M. Comly and Eliakim P. Scammon, both of whom became influential nationally after the war. Harrison Gray Otis, the famed owner and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, also fought with the 23rd Ohio during the war. Organization and service The 23rd Ohio Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Chase (Columbus, Ohio) and mustered into duty on June 11, 1861, as a three-year regiment. Its 950 enlistees were originally led by Col. William Rosecrans. In July, after training and drilling, the regiment departed for western Virginia, where it served for several months, helping to restore that portion of Virginia to the Union. The 23rd was attached to Jacob D. Cox's Kanawha Brigade and served throughout much of the war in what became the IX Corps. The unit saw heavy action during the Battle of South Mountain, where Colonel Hayes was wounded in an attack on the slopes near Fox's Gap. Within a week, the regiment fought at Antietam in the fields southeast of Sharpsburg, Maryland, before returning to duty in West Virginia. It was again heavily engaged in Philip Sheridan's 1864 Valley Campaign. The regiment mustered out in July 1865. The regiment lost 5 officers and 154 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 1 officer and 130 enlisted men by disease (total 290 out of 2230 who were members of the regiment at various times).

All Larks are made of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). The Lark is a one-design class which leads to very close racing. The boat is very popular in the UK with a new builder (Ovington boats) signed up in 2010. In the UK the class became very popular through the university team racing circuit. The boat was also popular in clubs as it is suited to a wide range of crew weights, typically from 18 stone up to 25 stone. It is still one of the fastest non-trapeze dinghies available. Larks participate in handicap racing, utilising a Portsmouth number of 1073. National Championships are held every year in the UK. Entries to the Nationals in the 1970s and 1980s was typically 125 plus boats and although numbers have dropped still typically attracts 50 plus boats to the Nationals. This class is well known for its social events and the Masters continue this tradition with an event every two years. Club Sailing In the United States, Larks are sailed at several east coast universities, including Tufts and The University of Connecticut. The University of Connecticut fleet is among the oldest functioning fleet in the United States. In the United States of America college sailing forms part of the training scheme for Olympic competition, sharing the same training model as many other collegiate sports. Although the Olympic class 470 is far more powerful than the collegiate 420, the former is similar to the Lark, making it an ideal junior boat for the 470. The Lark also shares skiff like characteristics with the 49er, another Olympic class, hence the Lark's suitability for collegiate sailing in relatively flat water conditions, which amount to roughly 70% of all college venues. In mixed fleets, Larks sail off a D-PN handicap of 93.6.

Located at 1001 Loyola Avenue, it is served by Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and NORTA with direct connections to the Rampart‚ÄìSt. Claude Streetcar Line. The station is the major southern terminus hub for Amtrak, serving three long-distance trains, the City of New Orleans, the Crescent, and the Sunset Limited. Between 1993 and the strike of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Sunset Limited continued east to Florida. Since the hurricane, New Orleans has been the eastern terminus of the route, although in 2016 Amtrak did propose bringing back service east of New Orleans. Amtrak also operates a coach and engine yard near the terminal.  History  Union Passenger Terminal was built just west of the older New Orleans Union Station to consolidate the city's passenger rail operations. Previously, New Orleans had been served by five stations‚ÄìUnion Station, the Southern Railway Terminal, T&P; Station, Louisiana & Arkansas Station, and Louisville & Nashville Station. Parts of the station property also are over what once was the turning basin for the New Basin Canal. The main lead track to the terminal follows the path of the old canal (which was filled in) and the Pontchartrain Expressway/I-10. The Kansas City Southern Railway's Flying Crow at New Orleans Union Terminal on November 22, 1967 NOUPT was designed in 1949 by the New Orleans architectural firms of Wogan and Bernard, Jules K. de la Vergne, and August Perez and Associates. When it opened in 1954, it was considered an ultramodern facility, completed just at the time that air travel was taking off at the expense of rail travel.* The stub-end terminal consists of covered platforms and a modern waiting hall. A long mural of Louisiana and New Orleans history, painted by Conrad A. Albrizio with the assistance of James Fisher, Crescent City Choo Choo exhibit was restored after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. The freight and express houses are now the domain of the Smoothie King Center and Main Post Office. In the 1970s, parts of two platforms were shortened to allow for Greyhound Lines to move its service there, creating an intermodal facility. Following Hurricane Katrina, Amtrak provided the first commercial transportation out of New Orleans. During the recovery efforts, the bus station at NOUPT was used for a temporary jail nicknamed Camp Greyhound. In January 2013, the station became the terminus for the new mile-long Loyola Avenue-Union Passenger Terminal Streetcar Line connecting Canal Street with the Central Business District and destinations such as the Superdome. The $52 million project was largely funded through a $45 million Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant awarded to the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority by the U.S. Department of Transportation.Great American Stations (NOL).

OWAW was a crossover storyline that spanned several different books, including several books starring Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and a number of supporting characters and books. Creators involved in the crossover included writers Jeph Loeb, Joe Casey, Mark Schultz, Joe Kelly, Phil Jimenez, and Peter David, and artists that included Mike Wieringo, Ed McGuinness, Doug Mahnke, Ron Garney, and Leonard Kirk. Plot The crossover, which occurred mainly through the monthly Superman titles, Wonder Woman, and a series of character themed one-shot specials, dealt with the heroes of the DC Universe facing the threat of the cosmic force known as Imperiex, who attacked Earth for the purpose of using the planet as the staging ground for the \\"hollowing\\" of the entire universe. Thanks to the sacrifice of Strange Visitor and General Rock, Earth's forces managed to crack Imperiex's armor, intending that Darkseid would subsequently use boom tube technology to transfer Imperiex's energy back to the galaxies that he had destroyed. However, Brainiac-13 appeared on the battleground with Warworld, and absorbed the Imperiex energies, vowing to use them to rule everything. In a desperate gambit, Superman dived into the heart of the sun, thus gaining a massive power boost that enhanced his abilities significantly. Rapidly realizing that Warworld could not be destroyed without releasing Imperiex and triggering another Big Bang, Superman and the Martian Manhunter formed a brief telepathic link with the remaining major combatants ‚Äî including Darkseid, Lex Luthor, Steel and Wonder Woman ‚Äî to explain their new plan. With Darkseid's powers weakened, they would have to use Tempest, empowered by the faith and strength of the Amazons, focusing the energy through Steel's new 'Entropy Aegis' armor (which was created from a burned-out Imperiex probe), and, with Lex Luthor activating a temporal displacement weapon, Superman would subsequently push Warworld through a temporal boom tube, sending both Imperiex Prime's and Brainiac's consciousness back 14 billion years to the Big Bang, destroying both villains through a combined effort. In his final moments, Imperiex Prime realized, in an ironic twist, that the imperfection he had detected in the universe was himself. The planet Daxam was involved, temporarily stolen from its rightful orbit.

He was appointed in 2004 by general John D. Altenburg as a Presiding Officer on the Guantanamo military commissions. The Washington Post reported: \\"...that Brownback and Altenburg have known each other since 1977, that Brownback's wife worked for Altenburg, and that Altenburg hosted Brownback's retirement party in 1999.\\" Brownback is also a combat veteran who served two tours in Vietnam, the first as part of the 173rd Brigade and later as a member of the US Special Forces. He was the honour graduate of his special forces course that he completed in 1972. Defense attorneys challenged the bias of five of the six presiding officers at the Guantanamo military tribunal, including Brownback. Altenburg removed three officers but retained Brownback. He was the only officer appointed to the first commission who had any legal training. Dismissed charges against Omar Khadr In the Summer of 2006 the United States Supreme Court overturned the then current version of the Guantanamo military commission on constitutional grounds. The Supreme Court had ruled that, under the separation of powers, the Bush Presidency lacked the constitutional authority to institute military commissions. The Supreme Court however, did rule that the United States Congress did have the constitutional authority to legislate such military commissions. In the fall of 2006 the Congress passed the Military Commissions Act, which authorized military commissions similar to those the Supreme Court overturned, to try \\"unlawful enemy combatants\\". Brownback and Captain Keith J. Allred, ruled that, since Khadr and Salim Ahmed Hamdan's Combatant Status Review Tribunals had not determined that they were \\"unlawful enemy combatants\\", but merely \\"enemy combatants\\", the commissions lacked jurisdiction to try them. On June 4, 2007, in a move the BBC described as a \\"stunning blow\\" to the Bush Presidency's detainee policy, Brownback dismissed all charges against Canadian youth Omar Khadr. By June 2007, none of the Guantanamo captives had had a \\"competent tribunal\\", such as the AR-190-8 Tribunal, determine whether they broke any of the laws of war that would result in stripping them of the protections of Geneva Conventions Prisoner of War status. November 2007 Guantanamo Military Commission hearings An appeal court determined that the Presidents of Military Commissions had the authority to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants. Brownback reconvened Khadr's proceedings on Thursday, November 8, 2007. Before Brownback determined whether Khadr was an unlawful combatant, lawyers were allowed to challenge the official as to whether he was an appropriate person to sit as Khadr's judge. Brownback postponed ruling on Khadr's combatant status, giving attorneys more time for preparation. The next two sessions were scheduled for December 7, 2007 and January 13, 2008. Replaced Brownback chastised the prosecution telling them \\"they had to provide Khadr's defence lawyers with records of his confinement at the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or he would suspend the proceedings.\\" On May 29, 2008 the military suddenly announced that a new officer was appointed to replace Brownback as judge in the Khadr case. Reuters noted that \\"The dismissal came on the same day that Pentagon prosecutors filed new charges against three other Guantanamo prisoners and defense lawyers accused the prosecutors of trying to rush cases to trial before the November U.S. presidential election.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Guantanamo Military Commission members Category:United States Army colonels Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War ","title":"Peter Brownback"},{"id":"3639169","text":"Franz Baader (15 June 1959, Spalt) is a German computer scientist at Dresden University of Technology .http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~baader/index-en.html Franz Baader Home Page He received his PhD in Computer Science in 1989 from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, where he was a teaching and research assistant for 4 years.

The name of the ensemble refers to a droll - a short comical sketch of a type that originated during the Puritan Interregnum in England. Although their main repertoire consists of music and songs from across the Europe, they also sing and play music of skomorokchs. The first album simply named \\"Drolls\\" was released in 2000, and shortly after that, in the beginning of 2001, was released the second album named \\"Kalenda Maya\\". In 2006 Drolls together with the Belarusian ethno-band Guda recorded the album called \\"Zara\\", in which kupala and harvest songs are mixed with French estampie, Macedonian dances and much more. The result can be described as a world music in a way. The same year Drolls were engaged in another project, and tried themselves both as both musicians and actors in the medieval play, which is based on poems of the famous manuscript Carmina Burana. The play is set in a medieval tavern, where its main characters discuss quite serious matters over a pint. In 2007 the ensemble members appeared as actors yet again, but this time as medieval Slavic performers - skomorokhs in the historical movie \\"Alexander. Nevskaya Bitva\\" dedicated to Alexander Nevsky (1221-1263). The short performance musicians made for the film laid the foundation of their new program which was quite different to what they did before. And in the end of 2007 Drolls presented their new concert program called \\"–õ—é–¥–∏ –í–µ—Å–µ–ª—ã\\" (Skomorokhs) in Moscow, which was followed by release of the new album in 2008. For musicians playing European music this was a move back to their roots, as main characters here are Slavic street performers, playing music very characteristic for those kind of performers and using more than 20 authentic music instruments of XIV‚ÄîXVII centuries Russia. In 2009 Drolls released their last studio album to the date, called \\"Decimus\\" (The Tenth). In the following years Drolls devoted themselves more to an artistic collaboration. In 2014 together with the Petrozavodsk State University Choir they presented a new program called \\"Cantigas\\". This was quite a success, so in 2018 Drolls and the University Choir presented their second joint music project called \\"Codex Buranus\\". In the beginning of 2019 appeared another joint project, but this time together with \\"Onego\\" folk instruments orchestra, in which two ensembles presented new remastered versions of pieces from the Skomorokhs program. In the end of 2019, for the ensemble's 20th birthday, Drolls and Petrozavodsk State Glazunov Conservatoire orchestra presented a project called Danza della Morte Nera.

The station joined the network in May 1981, following the opening of the line between South Gosforth and Bank Foot. The line opened in June 1905, as part of the Ponteland and Darras Hall branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. Wansbeck Road is situated between the former Coxlodge and West Gosforth stations. The line closed to passengers in June 1929, with Coxlodge and West Gosforth stations closing to goods in November 1965 and August 1967 respectively. Wansbeck Road is built on an embankment above Wansbeck Road, with platforms located on opposite sides of the road. A second concrete span was added to the original single-track bridge in the late 1970s, during the construction of the Tyne and Wear Metro. The station is also located near to the point where the Ponteland and Darras Hall branch crossed over the former Fawdon Wagonway, which operated between 1818 and 1826. In 2018, the station, along with others on the Airport branch, were refurbished as part of the Metro: All Change programme. The project saw improvements to accessibility, security and energy efficiency, as well as the re-branding of the station to the new black and white corporate colour scheme. The station was used by 166,282 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the sixth- least-used station on the network.  Facilities  Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramped access to both platforms at Wansbeck Road. The station is equipped with ticket machines, waiting shelter, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network. There is no dedicated car parking available at the station.

A convert to Islam, he was appointed as Khan of Kartli by the Persian Shah Tahmasp I from 1562 (effectively from 1569) to 1578. Life David was a brother of the Kartlian king Simon I, who led a long-lasting liberation war against the Safavid Persian and Ottoman empires. In December 1561, David repaired to Qazvin to offer his submission to Shah Tahmasp, converted to Islam and adopted the name of Daud Khan. The shah appointed him ruler in Kartli, elevated him to the rank of farzand (\\"son\\") at his investiture, and sent with a Persian army to claim the power. He may have been an unnamed Georgian prince reported by the English explorer Anthony Jenkinson as attending his audience with Shah Tahmasp on 20 November 1562, but Daud appears to have been returned to Georgia in August 1562 and the Georgian prince of Jenkinson's report could have been another Georgian renegade, Prince Jesse of Kakheti (Isa Khan). Relying on the Persian occupation forces and a few loyal nobles, Daud was in control of the Georgian capital Tbilisi and the province of Lower Kartli, while the rest of the kingdom remained faithful to Simon. The rival brothers met on the battlefield on several occasions. The hostilities took place mainly around Tbilisi, which was blockaded by Simon‚Äôs forces from 1567 to 1569. Although the king won the battles at Dighomi (1567) and Samadlo (1569), the Persians eventually prevailed and took Simon captive at the Battle of Partskhisi, 1569. He was sent in chains to the fortress of Alamut, and Daud Khan assumed nominal control of all of Kartli. As previously, he relied on the Persians and paid an annual tribute to the Shah. A patriotic alliance of nobles led by Prince Sachino Baratashvili continued, however, resistance to the renegade Georgian ruler. In 1578, a peace between the Safavids and the Ottomans collapsed. The Turkish army commanded by Lala Mustafa Pasha overran much of Georgia and dislodged Daud Khan, who had burnt the citadel of Tbilisi and taken shelter at Lorri. The Shah presently freed Simon to fight against the Ottomans and reinstated him as king of Kartli. In retaliation, Daud Khan handed the control over Lorri to the Turks and fled to Istanbul, where he was welcomed and granted lordship over two sanjaks. His sons, Bagrat and Khosro, took shelter in Persia. During his stay in Turkey, Daud Khan compiled two Ottoman-era medical treatises (qarabadin) and translated it into Georgian, sending a copy to his motherland. Family David was married to Elene (), a relative of King Alexander II of Kakheti. They had the following children: #Bagrat VII, King of Kartli #A daughter, married Prince Asanbeg (Kaikhosro) Baratashvili (fl. 1599‚Äì1620) #A daughter, married Baindur (Baadur), Duke of Aragvi #A daughter, married Prince Adam-Sultan Andronikashvili.

Katherine Stinson (February 14, 1891 ‚Äì July 8, 1977) was a pioneering American aviator. She set flying records for aerobatic maneuvers, distance, and endurance. Biography She was born on February 14, 1891, in Fort Payne, Alabama. She was the fourth woman in the United States to obtain a pilot's certificate, which she earned on 24 July 1912, at the age of 21, while residing in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Initially, she planned to get her certificate and use money she earned from exhibition flying to pay for her music lessons. However, she found she liked flying so much that she gave up her piano career and decided to become an aviator. In January 1911, Stinson went to St. Louis to take flight lessons from Tony Jannus who allowed her to fly only as a passenger. She more than likely received some ground schooling and words of encouragement from Wilbur Wright himself as she is seen in his company about to refuel an aircraft in early 1912 but Wilbur died in May 1912 and before her flight training was begun or complete. She then took flying lessons from the well-known aviator Max Lillie, a pilot for the Wright Brothers, who initially refused to teach her because she was female. But she persuaded him to give her a trial lesson. She was so good that she flew alone after only four hours of instruction. A year after receiving her certificate, she began exhibition flying. On the exhibition circuit, she was known as the \\"Flying Schoolgirl.\\" Katherine Stinson tried to tell newspaper reporters she was actually 21, not 16, but they refused to believe her. After she received her certificate, Stinson and her family moved to San Antonio, Texas, an area with an ideal climate for flying. There her sister, Marjorie, began giving flying instruction at the family's aviation school in Texas. In March 1915 the famous Lincoln Beachey died in a crash at San Francisco and Stinson later acquired the rotary engine from his wrecked plane. Gnome Gamma engine and Katherine Stinson doing maintenance in Japan on 3 September 1917 On July 18, 1915, Stinson became the first woman to perform a loop, at Cicero Field in Chicago, Illinois, and went on to perform this feat some 500 times without a single accident. She also was one of the first women authorized to carry airmail for the United States. During World War I, Stinson flew a Curtiss JN-4D \\"Jenny\\" and a Curtiss Stinson-Special (a single seat version of the JN aircraft built to her specifications) for fundraising tours for the American Red Cross. During exhibition flights in Canada, Stinson set Canadian distance and endurance records, and, in 1918, made the second air mail flight in Canada between Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta. On December 11, 1917, Katherine Stinson flew 606 miles from San Diego to San Francisco, setting a new American non- stop distance record. The Stinson School closed in 1917, and Katherine became an ambulance driver for the Red Cross in Paris. In 1918, she flew non-stop from Chicago to Binghamton, New York. In Europe during World War I, she contracted influenza, which damaged her lungs, making her susceptible to tuberculosis. In 1920, she retired from aviation. In 1927, Stinson married airman Miguel Antonio Otero, Jr., son of the former territorial governor of New Mexico, and worked as an architect and home designer for many years in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After a long period as an invalid, she died in 1977 at the age of 86. Katherine Stinson circa 1914-1915 Katherine Stinson's biography is featured in CBS TV series The Henry Ford's Innovation Nation, episode 54 in the series. Legacy Stinson's flying inspired her brothers to form the Stinson Aircraft Company. All of her stunt flying was done in aircraft using the Wright control system, which uses two side-mounted levers for pitch and roll, with top mounted controls for throttle and yaw. *An early Laird biplane looped by Stinson is on display at the Henry Ford Museum. *A replica of her 1918 Curtiss Stinson-Special is on display at the Alberta Aviation Museum in Edmonton. The second oldest general aviation airport in the United States, Stinson Municipal Airport (KSSF) in San Antonio, Texas, was named in the Stinson family's honor. A middle school in northwest San Antonio, TX, Katherine Stinson Middle School, was named in her honor. In 2000, Stinson was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

Originally, the accensi were light infantry in the armies of the early Roman Republic. They were the poorest men in the legion, and could not afford much equipment. They did not wear armour or carry shields, and their usual position was part of the third battle line. They fought in a loose formation, supporting the heavier troops. They were eventually phased out by the time of Second Punic War. In the later Roman Republic the term was used for civil servants who assisted the elected magistrates, particularly in the courts, where they acted as ushers and clerks.  Infantry  = History and deployment = Accensi appear to have evolved from the old fifth class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The fifth class was made up of the poorest soldiers in the legion who were equipped with slings and perhaps a small shield. They acted as skirmishers, screening their own formations and disrupting the enemy. It is likely that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gauls taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.  Camillan system  In the early Camillan system of organisation of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes according to wealth, the accensi being the poorest. Accensi were armed with slings which they used to hurl stones at enemy formations. They fought as skirmishers, wearing only a tunic and sometimes carrying a small round shield. In this type of legion, the 900 accensi formed 15 maniples, military units of 60 men each, which were in turn part of 15 ordines, larger units made up of a maniple of triarii, a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi. The accensi stood in the last line of the legion, behind the front line of hastati, the second line of principes, the third of triarii and the fourth of rorarii. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, heavier and more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes did not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy in turn ‚Äî hence the expression rem ad Triarios redisse, \\"it has come to the triarii\\" ‚Äî signalling an act of desperation. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii, the poorer reserve soldiers, and accensi, the least dependable troops armed with slings, would be used in a support role, providing mass and supporting wavering areas of the line.  Polybian system  By the time of the later Polybian system of the 2nd century BC, accensi had been phased out. Velites, light skirmishers, would now fulfill skirmishing duties and troops that would usually have gone into the accensi would now be excluded from service.  Civil servants  As with the lictors, accensi were usually professional civil servants, providing assistance to the elected magistrates during their term in office. In the courts, they summoned witnesses, kept track of time, and helped keep order. Outside of the courts, they escorted the magistrate and acted as heralds.

It has a number of potential causes, ranging from muscle strain to collapse of a vertebra or rare serious diseases. The upper spine is very strong and stable to support the weight of the upper body, as well as to anchor the rib cage which provides a cavity to allow the heart and lungs to function and protect them. In most cases, the pain is likely to be self-limiting; in that case no diagnostic tests are required, and simple pain relief is sufficient. More severe and prolonged cases may require more specific pain management strategies and occasionally investigations for underlying medical diseases. Signs and symptoms The thoracic spine begins at the base of the neck and extends to the middle of the trunk. Any pain in this area is considered \\"middle back pain\\". The exact symptoms associated with middle back pain will depend upon the underlying cause. Most middle back pain is not serious in nature. However, it does tend to have more serious pathology associated with it than pain in the neck or low back. Symptoms can include pain, either locally near the spine or referred along area the corresponding nerve dermatome. Symptoms can also include numbness or pins and needles when nerve irritation or compression is involved. Weakness in the legs or loss of bowel or bladder control in the presence of thoracic spine pain can indicate spinal cord compression and should be investigated. Causes The most common causes of upper back pain are unknown but theorized to originate from muscular irritation, intervertebral discs, spinal facet joints, ribs or soft tissue (e.g. ligament/fascia) problems. Commonly intra-scapular pain is referred from the lower cervical spine. Contributing factors to injury include; lack of strength, poor posture, overuse injuries (such as repetitive motion), or a trauma (such as a car accident or sports injury). Often thoracic pain can be aggravated twisting, side bending and with prolonged bent spinal postures. A compression fracture of the vertebra can also cause acute and/or chronic pain in the upper back. Trauma may cause a fracture, but in women over age 50 without significant trauma or someone known to have osteoporosis, a spontaneous vertebral compression fracture is possible. Other, less common causes of thoracic back pain include a spinal disc herniation which often may have radicular pain (wrapping around the ribs associated with numbness and burning pain), spinal tumors and rib fractures may mimic thoracic pain/radicular pain. Other possible sources of referral pain into the thoracic region include visceral organs like: lungs, gallbladder, stomach, liver duodenum, pleura and cardiac. Middle back pain has long been considered a \\"red flag\\" to alert healthcare professionals to the possibility of cancer (metastasis or spread to the spine). This is not a sensitive or specific phenomenon and can therefore not be relied upon in isolation. =Risk factors= Thoracic spinal pain is associated with: concurrent musculoskeletal pain; growth and physical; lifestyle and social; backpack; postural; psychological; and environmental factors. Specific risk factors identified in adolescents included age (being older) and poorer mental health. Mechanism The word \\"thoracic\\" means pertaining to the chest, and the thoracic spine comprises the upper portion of the spine that corresponds to the chest area. The upper spine includes twelve vertebrae, and each of the upper nine vertebrae in this section attach to a rib on either side of the spine. Each of the ribs then curves around the side of the body and attaches to the breastbone in front. This forms a sturdy structure (the thoracic cage) that supports and protects the internal organs ‚Äî the heart, lungs and liver. Diagnosis Detailed physiologic testing proving what percentage of pain in the thoracic spine is caused by disc, facet, rib or muscle are yet to be completed so the answer to the question what is causing the pain often is left unanswered. If thoracic pain presents with weakness or numbness of the legs, bowel or bladder incontinence, and/or falling immediate MRI imaging is indicated. Management Non specific thoracic spine pain is usually treated by one or a combination of the following: * Exercise/Active and passive physical therapy * Deep massage or massage therapy * Ice and/or heat therapy * Analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs * Joint manipulation, as commonly performed by physical therapists, chiropractors or osteopathic physicians (D.O.). * If there is a specific tender spot, then trigger point massage or injections can be helpful. A painful vertebral compression fracture may be treated with pain medication and rest, or with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery. If the cause is thought to be osteoporosis, oral or intravenous bisphosphonates may be administered to reduce further fracture risk.

They share territory along the Shushufindi, Aguarico, and Cuyabeno river with the Secoya people, with whom they are sometimes considered a single population. The Siona language is a Tucanoan language. The Siona people are organized politically through the National Organization of Seona Indigenous People of Ecuador (ONISE), whose president as of July 1996 was William Criollo. According to Richard Evan Schultes, Where The Gods Reign, p. 27, the \\"Siona are one of the western Tukanoan groups and live in the Comissaria del Putamayo in the region of Mocoa.\\" I lived in this area in the summer of 1961 with members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Our home was on the Ecuador side of the Putamayo River and the Siona lived on both sides of the river. The Siona live in Sucumbios Province in Ecuador, mainly in the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and in the Department of Putumayo along the Putumayo River. Besides some traditional activities for subsistence, they have been participating in the tourism activities since the 1990s. Nevertheless, their participation in the tourism sector has generated various sociocultural and economic changes such as immigration to neighboring cities, gender issues, economic dependency on tourism revenues. The religion of the Siona people is a type of shamanism that has many spirits that live inside of things like trees, bugs, plants, etc,, . Their origin story is about a being named Baina, who did mythic deeds that made up the world as it is today.

He fought in support of the Revolution Settlement and the House of Hanover, and their opposition to all attempts by the Jacobites to restore the House of Stuart either by force of arms or by political intrigue. Early life and career He was a child when James VII and II lost his throne and the Protestant succession of James's daughter Mary II and son-in-law William III was secured. He was a young man when the involvement of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, in personal union under Queen Anne, sent many Scots to fight under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in the War of the Spanish Succession on Continental Europe. His paternal grandfather Sir John Munro and his father Sir Robert, were successively chiefs of the Clan Munro: his uncle Andrew was a Captain, and several of his relatives served before him in the Royal Scots. It is not surprising, therefore, that the thoughts of young Robert should turn to an army career, and his earliest surviving letter (Oct. 1706) deals with plans for securing a commission, perhaps through the influence of the John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll who was in Scotland for the critical pre-Acts of Union 1707 debates: even service at home was not to be despised, as it \\"might draw on a greater thing\\". Anyhow, the commission was soon forthcoming, although its exact date is unknown, and in March 1710, Robert Munro is on record as a Captain in the Royal Scots (then at the Hague, Holland, Dutch Republic), commanded by George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney.Mackenzie. p. 118. He served for seven years in Flanders, it is said \\"with great reputation\\", and found himself out of employment when the war ended in 1712, and the Treaty of Utrecht brought 30 years of peace to Continental Europe. He then returned to Scotland. Member of Parliament But in the meantime, Robert had received a small part of the family estate from his father, and become a member of the Parliament of Great Britain. His patrimony, of which he received a crown character in 1708, comprised Meikle and Little Clynes and the lands of Drummond, near the present village of Evanton. Scotland's share in the Parliament of Great Britain at the Palace of Westminster was 15 burgh members and 30 from the shires and at the general election of 1710 Robert was chosen under the limited franchise of those days by the northern constituency of Tain Burghs (the burghs of Dingwall, Tain, Dornoch, Wick and Kirkwall), which he was to represent through five more elections for a period of 31 years. With his Whig sympathies‚Äîwhich probably cost him his rank in the army on his return from Flanders‚Äîthe young M.P. could always be relied on to oppose Tory measures, including their efforts to subvert the Protestant succession. The health of Queen Anne and the threat of invasion were matters of concern, and some weeks after her death in August 1714, her successor George I of Great Britain arrived from Hanover to assume the throne with Whig support. Robert by now was moving in high political circles, reading his letters from Scotland to Robert Walpole and his colleagues. London politicians liked to think that the Tories in Scotland would give no trouble in taking the oaths to King George, \\"but I that know them don't believe it\\", he wrote. When the king was proclaimed at Inverness there was something like a riot, and at Tain people were mustering and arming, with \\"guards upon all houses\\". Support for the ministers in office was usually rewarded, just as opposition was penalised. After the arrival of George I, Robert reported sadly more than once that \\"there is nothing yet done\\" for him; but in December he was offered and accepted a commission (backdated to 9 August) to replace a MacKenzie as Captain of an Independent Company raised ten years earlier to help in policing the northern Scottish Highlands. This was one of three such companies, forming distinct units unconnected with each other, and responsible for peace and security in their own area‚Äîone commanded by Captain Campbell of Fonab operating \\"besouth the braes of Athole and Angus\\", Captain William Grant's \\"benorth Dee\\", and the third to the north and west of Loch Ness. They wore no special military uniform, being clothed in \\"plads, tartan coats, trousers and hose\\" like other Highlanders. Captain Robert Munro (who had John Campbell of Carrick as his first Lieutenant, and Alexander Fraser of Culduthel as second) commanded his company for less than two years, as the events of 1715‚Äì1716 brought him another and a more vital role. Jacobite risings of 1715‚Äì1719 In the Jacobite rising of 1715, the standard of rebellion was raised by John Erskine, Earl of Mar, now out of office and out of favour with the new sovereign. In the northern shires John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland was the King's Lieutenant, and the Clans Sutherland, Mackay, Ross and Munro could be counted on to support the Government, but the Mackenzies, Macdonalds and Chisholms were Jacobites, and the Frasers divided owing to a disputed chiefship. The old Laird of Foulis, who lived until 1729, had lost his eyesight in early life, and the leadership of the Munros therefore devolved on his sons. Robert was in London when rumours first gained ground that a rising was intended, but his brother George of Culcairn put the clan in a state of readiness at the beginning of August, and this example was followed by others, in spite of a great shortage of arms, ammunition and money. About a week after Erskine raised the standard on 6 September, the Jacobites occupied Inverness, where William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth put in a Mackenzie governor. Young Robert Munro of Foulis made a move in that direction, but was stopped before he had crossed the River Conon. Calling on those well disposed to the Government to support him, he then formed an encampment at the bridge of Alness, where he was joined on 5 October by Clan Sutherland and Clan MacKay and detachments from further north. Seaforth advanced-with a larger force by way of Dingwall, Clare and Boath, and after some parleying between the two sides and a council of war, the Earl of Sutherland and chief of MacKays withdrew northwards, while the Munros who had been for fighting instead had their country overrun and plundered by the massive Jacobite force. Even the manses were looted and the ministers\\" libraries scattered (the Presbyterian clergy were anti-Jacobite to a man), and some worse excesses were reported. It was not until 22 October that Seaforth marched south to Perth, and his enemies believed that but for this \\"diversion\\" some 4,000 Jacobites from the north would have joined Mar three or four weeks earlier than they did, before Argyll had gathered a sufficient force to oppose them at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. In November, the Whig lairds of Kilravock and Culloden, now joined by Simon Fraser of Lovat (who had been outlawed and in exile), put pressure on the Jacobite garrison in Inverness, which was delivered upon the very day when Sherriffmuir was fought and another Jacobite force was defeated at the Battle of Preston (1715). Young Foulis marched into the town with 400 Munros and took over control as governor, although his commission (and his brevet of colonel) had been intercepted by the rebels at Perth. James Francis Edward Stuart came and went (he was less than two months in Scotland), Government troops arrived in Inverness towards the end of February, and for some months the process of disarming the rebels went on, helped by a Munro detachment under George Munro, 1st of Culcairn. With the rising suppressed, and the Hanoverian succession firmly established, Colonel Robert's interest with the Government and his own compassionate nature prompted him to mediate on behalf of some of the defeated leaders (including Alexander Macdonell of Glengarry) and their wives and children. In 1719, Robert's brother, George Munro, 1st of Culcairn led a detachment of men at the Battle of Glenshiel where they helped defeat the Jacobites. Forfeited Estates Commissioner For the next ten years Robert Munro was kept busy, in addition to his duties as M.P. and landlord, as one of the only three Scots among the 13 M.P.s appointed (by a Commons ballot in June 1716) to be Commissioners for the survey and disposal of the estates of more than 50 attainted Jacobites, \\"in order to raise money out of them for the use of the public\\". Each Commissioner received a salary of ¬£1,000 a year, and as they could hold no other public office (though remaining M.P.s), Robert demitted his governorship of Inverness Castle and Independent Company command (both of which were given to Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat). Four English M.P.s joined Robert Munro and his colleague Patrick Haldane for the Scottish part of the commission's business, but they were greatly hindered by the dilatory ways of some members (including Sir Richard Steele, who was fined for non-attendance). When Munro was in Edinburgh he lodged in the Bristo house of William Scott, Professor of Greek language at the University of Edinburgh. Many of the estates were deep in debt before forfeiture, it was not easy to find purchasers, and a balance of little more than ¬£1,000 remained after all the claims, legal fees, and other expenses had been met. In 1725 the Forfeited Estates Commissioners ceased to operate, and the unsold estates were transferred to the Barons of the Exchequer. Baronet Munro After having been the effective leader of the clan for many years, Colonel Robert became Munro of Foulis and the sixth baronet on the death of his father in 1729. As a landowner he pioneered the planting of woodlands, of which he added nearly 500 acres (2 km¬≤) on the Foulis estate. As a heritor and an elder of the Church of Scotland, he was one of those who arranged on behalf of the General Assembly for the spending of ¬£1,000 a year of the \\"Royal Bounty\\" on the \\"reformation\\" of the Highlands and Islands by means of itinerant preachers and catechists. Described by a clansman as \\"an obliging, civil, moral gentleman, well beloved of his name\\", Sir Robert lived on friendly terms with his neighbours. His marriage to a member of a great English family -- Mary, daughter of Henry Seymour of Woodlands in Dorset -- took place in London in 1716, and the romantic story of a courtship interrupted by the purloining of their letters has been preserved by tradition. Their eldest son Harry was sent to Dr. Doddridge's academy at Northampton, Westminster School and Leiden University. Another son entered the Royal Navy. Of Sir Robert's activities in Parliament, the almost complete absence of reported debates leaves little to be said. Outside the British House of Commons, we find him at various times trying to secure the reinstatement in a Customs post at Inverness of a neighbour's brother; he took an active part in pressing for Simon Fraser's pardon and succession to the Lovat estates; he helped to find employment for the son of a Mackenzie friend, and for a scape-grace of the Atholl family, but a political foe alleged that as Sheriff of Ross he had a Mackenzie sheriff-substitute stripped of office and replaced by a Munro. The clan rivalries which had erupted in rebellion were finding an outlet in local politics. The MacKenzies Earl of Seaforth came to an end in 1716, and it seems to have been arranged that while the Rosses held the county seat the Munros would represent the Tain Burghs. To secure the burghs, control of three out of the five was necessary, and the manoeuvrings by which the councils were persuaded to send the \\"right\\" delegate to vote in parliamentary elections were often exciting, and even a show of force was likely. Ross ascendancy was secure in Tain, and from 1716 to 1745 the Munros controlled Dingwall, with Robert of one of his brothers as provost‚Äîbut not without something like two armed Munro \\"invasions\\" of the county town in 1721 and 1740, when opposing councillors were abducted to secure a favourable result (for the first incident Colonel Robert and his brother were fined ¬£200 each,Mackenzie. pp. 121‚Äì127. and after the second his parliamentary career came to an abrupt end with defeat at the 1741 election). Lieutenant-Colonel of the 43rd Highlanders This probably mattered less to Sir Robert, as he was now securely back in the British Army. The Independent Companies, disbanded after the Rising, had been revived by General George Wade, and in 1739 the six companies were increased to ten and formed into a regular Highland regiment 780 strong under his command‚Äîfamous in military history as the 43rd Highlanders, Royal Highland Regiment, or Black Watch. Their uniform, approved personally by George II of Great Britain when Sir Robert presented a sergeant and private soldier to His Majesty in London in 1740, included a kilt of dark green \\"military\\" tartan, belted plaid, and blue bonnet with black cockade. The regiment's first colonel was John Lindsay, 20th Earl of Crawford, who was briefly succeeded by Hugh Sempill, 12th Lord Sempill, but Sir Robert Munro as Lieutenant-Colonel had the chief responsibility during the formative years.Mackenzie. p. 129. Among the Captains were his brother George Munro, 1st of Culcairn and Campbell of Carrick, and a cousin John Munro, 4th of Newmore. The surgeon was George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie, a distant clansmen. After mustering beside the Tay near Aberfeldy, and continuing the duties of the previous Independent Companies for some time in Northern Scotland, the regiment was ordered to London in 1743, where a serious incident occurred. Believing that they would not be required to serve abroad, and alarmed by rumours that they were to be sent to the American plantations, about 200 men (without their officers) decided to return home and began the long march north. They were overtaken at Oundle, Northamptonshire, where Newmore was one of the officers who disarmed and persuaded them to return. Three of those condemned to death by court- martial were shot, and the remainder transported to the British West Indies: although they blamed the Government, and not their officers, for a breach of faith, it was an unfortunate start to what was to become a remarkable record of service. Highlanders on display to the King It is recorded by General Stewart of Garth that King George II of Great Britain having never seen a Highland soldier expressed a desire to see one.Mackenzie. pp. 132‚Äì133. Three privates were selected and sent to London under Sir Robert Munro shortly before the 43rd Regiment went to the Continent. One of these privates ‚Äì John Grant died on the way but the other two ‚Äì Gregor MacGregor and John Campbell were presented to the King by Sir Robert Munro. They went through the broadsword exercise, and showed their skill in handling the Lochaber axe before his Majesty the king, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, Marshal George Wade and a number of general officers. Their dexerity and skill in management of their weapons satisfied the King. War in France War on Continental Europe was moving towards a direct confrontation between the Kingdom of Great Britain and France under Louis XV, and the regiment embarked immediately for Flanders. There the men earned high praise for their behaviour towards the civilian population, and the regiment became a favourite choice as guardians of property; Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria told his envoy in London that this was owing to Sir Robert's care, \\"for whose sake he should always pay a regard to a Scotchman\\". Their first action against the French came on 11 May 1745 at the Battle of Fontenoy. A British army under Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland faced the forces of Maurice, comte de Saxe and was defeated, but the \\"Highland furies\\" (as one Frenchman called them) saved it from disaster by their gallantry. Allowed \\"their own way of fighting\\" by the young Commander-in-Chief, each time they received the French fire Sir Robert ordered his men to \\"clap to the ground\\" (while he himself, because of his corpulence, stood alone with the colours behind him), and then springing up and closing with the enemy, they several times drove them back, and finished with a successful rear-guard action.Mackenzie. pp. 129‚Äì132. Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì1746 In June 1745, a little more than a month after the battle of Fontenoy, Sir Robert was \\"rewarded\\" by an appointment to succeed General Ponsonby (who was killed at Fontenoy) as Colonel of the English 37th (North Hampshire) Regiment of Foot.Mackenzie. pp. 133‚Äì134. When the Second Jacobite Rising broke out, his friends in the Highlands hoped for his presence among them (one wrote that it would have been \\"the greatest service to His Majesty and the common cause\\"), but it was not to be. Robert's regiment was brought over by sea to Newcastle upon Tyne. Meanwhile, his son Harry Munro and brother George Munro joined Sir John Cope with the able-bodied men of the Clan Munro. \\"Munro's 37th Foot\\" made from English soldiers formed part of the force which operated under George Wade's ineffective command in Northern England. Ordered to Scotland, they reached Edinburgh early in January, in time to march out and form part of the left wing of the force led by Henry Hawley which met the Jacobites in a storm of rain and hail at the Battle of Falkirk Muir. At first, Sir Robert was reported wounded and a prisoner, and then \\"murdered in cold blood\\"; it seems that only a servant and his younger brother (Dr. Duncan, who rode unarmed to his assistance and was also killed) were with him when he was shot or cut down. Robert had been attacked by six Jacobites of Cameron of Lochiel's regiment. Robert defended himself for some time with his half-pike and managed to kill two of the Jacobites. Another Jacobite then shot Robert with a pistol. He then finished Robert off with three sword blows to the head. Robert's unarmed brother, Dr Duncan ran to his assistance but he too was killed by being shot and slashed. By the orders of Mackenzie, Earl of Cromarty, Sir Robert Munro was honourably buried in Falkirk churchyard, by men of the Clan MacDonald, where several of the rebel leaders attended. His snuff mull was found in his pocket after the battle by David Monro of Allan who was the Edinburgh Law Agent for the Munro of Foulis family, and it is (as of Mackenzie writing in 1898) still preserved at Allan House.Mackenzie. pp. 294 - 295. Legacy The Munro monument, Trinity Church, Falkirk A monument was later erected for Sir Robert Munro in Falkirk churchyard. An entry in the Falkirk Parish Church accounts for October 1750 shows: \\"Present for the poor from Sir Harry Munro, five guineas, for the privilege of a Tomb upon Sir Robert, my Father, in the Church-yard\\". With elaborate decoration, and inscriptions in Latin and English language, which were renewed in 1848 and again in 1901, the monument was left in position when neighbouring stones were cleared away a few in years ago. Now, by its latest restoration, it is once more a fitting reminder of the man it commemorates: \\"Sincere and active in the service of his friends, humane and forgiving to his enemies, generous and benevolent to all, his death was universally regretted even by those who slew him.\\"Mackenzie. pp. 134‚Äì135. Family Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet married Mary, daughter of the Hon. Henry Seymour of Woodlands, Dorset, speaker of the House of Commons.Mackenzie. pp. 136‚Äì138. According to historian Alexander Mackenzie they had the following four children: #Robert Munro, who died in infancy. #Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet, heir and successor. #George Munro, who was an officer in the Royal Navy and who died unmarried in 1743. #Elizabeth Munro, who died in infancy. #Simon Munro, (1741‚Äì1790), although not mentioned as a son of Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet by Mackenzie, other sources claim that one Simon Munro who was a slave trader and who had a plantation in the Province of Georgia granted to him by George III of the United Kingdom was the son of Sir Robert and his wife Mary Seymour. However, the year of Simon's birth, 1741, is nine years after the death of Mary Seymour in 1732 so she could not have been his mother. Simon was apparently a 9th son and therefore had no inheritance and so he went to America and built up a mercantile business. Simon left five children: Elizabeth, Harry, Jane Seymour, Amarintha and Ann West Munro.Col. Sir Simon MUNRO clanmunrousa.org. Quoting: The History and Genealogy of the Habersham Family.

The thick, transparent exudate varies in color from light gold to dark brown, depending on the ratio of resin to essential oil. Copaiba is used in making varnishes and lacquers. The balsam may be steam distilled to give copaiba oil, a colorless to light yellow liquid with the characteristic odor of the balsam and an aromatic, slightly bitter, pungent taste. The oil consists primarily of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons; its main component is Œ≤-caryophyllene. The oil also contains significant amounts of Œ±-bergamotene, Œ±-copaene, and Œ≤-bisabolene.Valdir F. Veiga Jr. et al, Phytochemical and Antioedematogenic Studies of Commercial Copaiba Oils Available in Brazil; Phytotherapy Research, 15, 476-480 (2001). Copaiba is also a common name for several species of trees of the legume family native to Tropical Africa and North and South America.  Uses  Copaiba is particularly interesting as a source of biodiesel, because of the high yield of . The resin is tapped from standing trees, with an individual tree yielding per year. Copaiba oil-resins extracted have been used in folk medicine dating back to the 16th century by the natives of north and northeastern Brazil. The folk remedies were administered orally or used as an ointment in the treatment of various diseases. In Panama, the Yaviza people mix the resin with honey and give it to newborns to impart knowledge and ward off hexes. Within the Peruvian Amazon near Iquitos, it is also used as an insect repellent. The balsam and its oil are used as fixatives in soap perfumes and fragrances. Copaiba is also used as an artist material, especially in oil paint recipes and in ceramic decoration. Mineral painters use a medium made of copaiba, turpentine and lavender to mix with their minerals for adhesion to ceramic vessels before kiln firing. Copaiba makes a good medium for oils and helps with both adhesion and quality of shine. Industry and commerce The production of copaiba oil is socially significant to the Amazon because it represents approximately 95% of Brazil's oil-resin production industry. The Annual production of copaiba oil in the Amazon is estimated to be 500 tons/year.Sustainability of extraction and production of copaiba (Copaifera multijuga Hayne) oleoresin in Manaus, AM, Brazil.

The commercialization of copaiba as an oil or in capsule form has grown due to demand by traditional and widespread use, and is exported to other countries, including the United States, France, and Germany.

Li Ban was the founding emperor Li Xiong (Emperor Wu)'s nephew‚Äîthe son of his older brother Li Dang (ÊùéËï©), who died in battle in 303. After Li Dang's death, Li Ban was said to have been raised by Li Xiong and his wife Empress Ren‚Äîeven though his mother Lady Luo was still alive. Although Li Xiong himself had more than 10 sons by concubines, Empress Ren was sonless. Li Xiong was resolved to make one of the sons of his brother Li Dang crown prince and his successor. Initially, he considered Li Han (ÊùéÁêÄ), Li Ban's older brother, but Li Han died in battle against Yang Nandi in 323. In 324, he declared Li Ban the crown prince, reasoning that the empire's foundation was actually built by Li Te and Li Dang, and that it would be proper for him to pass the throne to Li Dang's son. He also valued Li Ban highly for his kindness and studiousness. Li Xiang (ÊùéÈ©§) and Wang Da (ÁéãÈÅî), foreseeing that this action would bring succession issues, objected, but were overruled by Li Xiong. In 334, Li Xiong grew ill from an infected head wound, which then spread to other wounds that he had suffered over the years over his body. His body was said to be causing such a great stench that his sons avoided him, but Li Ban cared for him day and night. He died in summer 334 and was succeeded by Li Ban. However, as Li Xiang had predicted, Li Xiong's sons were unhappy they were passed over. Two of them, Li Yue (ÊùéË∂ä) and his younger brother Li Qi, conspired against Li Ban. Li Ban's younger brother Li Wu (ÊùéÁéù), who had heard rumors of the conspiracy, suggested to Li Ban that he immediately send Li Yue and Li Qi away from the capital, back to their defense posts, but Li Ban did not have the heart to send away Li Xiong's sons before their father was buried. Instead, he sent Li Wu away to try to decrease the friction. In the winter, during one night when Li Ban was on mourning watch before Li Xiong's casket, Li Yue assassinated Li Ban and his older brother Li Du (ÊùéÈÉΩ), and made Li Qi emperor, after forging an edict from Empress Dowager Ren accusing Li Ban of crimes. Li Qi initially gave Li Ban the posthumous name Crown Prince Li (the same posthumous name that Emperor Wu of Han's crown prince Liu Ju, forced into rebellion against his father, received), effectively refusing to recognize Li Ban as an emperor. In 338, when Li Qi was overthrown by Li Shou, Li Shou posthumously honored Li Ban as Emperor Ai.

It was built between 1068 and 1086 by Baldwin FitzGilbert following a revolt in Devon against Norman rule, and formed the centre of the Honour of Okehampton, guarding a crossing point across the West Okement River. It continued in use as a fortification until the late 13th century, when its owners, the de Courtenays, became the Earls of Devon. With their new wealth, they redeveloped the castle as a luxurious hunting lodge, building a new deer park that stretched out south from the castle, and constructing fashionable lodgings that exploited the views across the landscape. The de Courtenays prospered and the castle was further expanded to accommodate their growing household. The de Courtenays were heavily involved in the 15th century Wars of the Roses and Okehampton Castle was frequently confiscated. By the early 16th century the castle was still in good condition, but after Henry Courtenay was executed by Henry VIII the property was abandoned and left to decay, while the park was rented out by the Crown. Parts of the castle were reused as a bakery in the 17th century, but by the 19th century it was completely ruined and became popular with Picturesque painters, including J. M. W. Turner. Renovation work began properly in the 20th century, first under private ownership and then, more extensively, after the castle was acquired by the state. In the 21st century it is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction. History =1066-1296= Okehampton Castle was built between 1068 and 1086 following the Norman conquest of England by Baldwin FitzGilbert. William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon forces at the battle of Hastings in 1066, but violence continued to flare up periodically for several years after the invasion. Baldwin FitzGilbert, a Norman lord, was responsible for putting down a rebellion in Devon in 1068. He was probably given extensive lands in the county at this time, and by the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he was noted as the owner of the Honour of Okehampton and well as the Sheriff of Devon and Constable of Exeter Castle.; The Honour of Okehampton was a grouping of around 200 estates across Devon, guarded by several castles, including Baldwin's main castle - or caput - at Okehampton, and those owned by his tenants, including Neroche and Montacute.; ; The bailey, seen from the motte, showing (l to r) the kitchens, buttery and Great Hall, and the eastern lodgings, chapel and priest's lodgings Baldwin's castle was positioned to protect an important route from Devon into Cornwall, including two fords that formed a crossing point over the West Okement River, and to control the existing town of Ocmundtune.; ; The castle was protected by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to Baldwin's tenants in exchange for their contributing to the castle's garrison. Baldwin also established a new town near the castle about away, complete with a market and a mill to grind grain.; This town eventually dominated the older Anglo-Saxon settlement and became known as Okehampton. On Baldwin's death the castle was inherited by his daughter, Adeliza, but the family appear to have taken little interest in the property. Okehampton Castle does not seem to have played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy. In 1173 Okehampton Castle passed to Renaud de Courtenay in marriage; his son, Robert de Courtenay married the daughter of William de Redvers, the Earl of Devon. The castle continued to have military utility and was requisitioned by Richard I between 1193 and 1194 to assist in the royal defence of Devon. The de Courteneys carried out some building work at the castle, installing new structures in the castle bailey. Robert was followed by his son John de Courtenay and by 1274, when John's son Hugh de Courtenay had inherited the property, the castle was reported to comprise only \\"an old motte which is worth nothing, and outside the motte a hall, chamber and kitchen poorly built\\", although this may underestimate the extent and condition of the castle. =1297-1455= Oakhampton Castle and the deer park; A - Oakhampton; B - East Okement River; C - Oakhampton Castle; D - West Okement River; E - Deer park; F - cleared settlements; G - Moor Brook The Redvers family line ran out in 1297, and as a result Hugh's son, another Hugh de Courtenay, inherited the Redvers family lands, later being confirmed as the Earl of Devon.; Hugh's main seat was at Tiverton Castle, but Hugh and his father redeveloped Okehampton Castle, expanding its facilities and accommodation to enable it be used as a hunting lodge and retreat.; Extensive building work turned the property into a luxurious residence. As part of this development, the family created a large, new deer park around the castle, replacing the older, unenclosed hunting grounds.; Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth for the first time chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures.; These settlements, comprising long houses built in warmer climate of the 12th and early 13th century, may already have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge at the end of the 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was used to hold required the packs of dogs for hunting. Once the castle's deer park was established, intensively farmed fallow deer became common on the lands, although wild boar, foxes and hare were also hunted.; Like other rural castles, the occupants of Okehampton Castle consumed a relatively large amount of venison, a prestige meat during the period. Some of this would have come from the surrounding deer park, but prime cuts of venison, such as the haunches, were also brought in specially from other locations. Excavations have shown that in addition to fish from large ponds in the park, Okehampton Castle also imported fish from the coast, over away, with hake, herring, plaice and whiting being most commonly eaten.; The Courtenays continued to own Okehampton for many years, the property passing through Hugh's son, Hugh, to his grandson Edward and then his great-grandson, another Hugh de Courtnenay. The size of noble households expanded during the period, and by the 1380s, when Edward controlled the castle, his \\"familiars\\", or extended household, could be up to 135 strong. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Okehampton Castle's facilities were extended further, probably to accommodate these increased numbers. =1455-1900= Frederick Widgery in 1913 In the 15th century, however, the Courtenays were embroiled in the civil conflict in England known as the Wars of the Roses between the rival alliances of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. Thomas de Courtenay fought for the Yorkists, but reconciled himself with the Lancastrians. His son, Thomas, died following his capture by the Yorkists at the battle of Towton in 1461. Edward IV confiscated Okehampton Castle, which was later returned to the family by the Lancastrian Henry VI. John Courtenay died fighting for the Lancastrians at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 and the castle and earldom was again confiscated. When Henry VII took the throne at the end of the conflict in 1485, however, the earldom and Okehampton were returned to Edward Courteney. Edward's son, William, enjoyed a turbulent political career, during which time the castle was again confiscated for a period, and his son, Henry, was executed by Henry VIII in 1539 and his properties confiscated, permanently breaking the link between the Courtenay family and the castle. After his death, a survey praised the castle as having \\"all manner of houses of offices\\", but from this time onwards the castle appears to have been abandoned and left to decay, although there is evidence that the lead and some of the stonework was taken for use on other projects.; The castle's deer park was rented out by the Crown after Courtenay's execution. Ownership of the castle remained important, however, as from 1623 onwards ownership carried the right to appoint Okehampton's two Members of Parliament. Despite the battle of Sourton Down being fought in 1643 near Okehampton during the English Civil War, the castle played no part in the conflict. A bakehouse was established in the castle in the late-17th century, reusing parts of the western lodgings. The deer park was disemparked during the 18th century, reverting to farmland. In the 18th century, the castle became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Richard Wilson painted the castle in 1771, dramatically silhouetting the keep against the sky, producing what historian Jeremy Black describes as a \\"calm, entranching and melancholic\\" effect. Thomas Walmesley's rendition went further, depicting Oakhampton Castle surrounded by an imaginary, Italianate lake in 1810. Thomas Girtin painted the castle in 1797, as did his friend J. M. W. Turner in 1824.; Sir Vyell Vyvyan conducted some minor repairs to the castle during the 19th century. =20th-21st centuries= In the early 20th century Okehampton Castle was bought by a local man, Sydney Simmons, who between 1911 and 1913 cleared away the vegetation that had grown over the castle and conducted some repairs to the stonework. Simmons passed the castle to the Okehampton Castle Trust in 1917, who carried out limited repairs over the coming decades.; The Ministry of Public and Works took over the site in 1967 and extensive restoration work was subsequently carried out. Extensive archaeological investigations were carried out in the 1970s at the site by Robert Higham. In the 21st century, the castle is operated as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. It is protected under law as an ancient monument and as a grade I listed building. Architecture Plan of the castle: A - Barbican; B - Great Hall and Buttery; C - Eastern Lodgings; D - Kitchen and Yard; E - Capel and Priest's Lodging; F - Western Lodgings; G - Motte and Keep Okehampton Castle was built along a long, thin rocky outcrop, rising up from the surrounding countryside. The stream that runs around the north side of the castle would have been more substantial in the medieval period and provided additional protection on that side, while the south side of the castle would have probably overlooked water-logged fields. The castle was mostly built from local stone, with aplite from nearby Meldon and some beerstone from south-east Devon; the interior and exterior stonework would have originally been rendered with lime plaster. The castle's final design involved a visitor entering from the barbican in the north-east, along a long passageway up the hill, into the bailey. On the south-west side of the bailey lay the motte, mounted by the keep. The castle's structure shows the results of its redesign at the start of the 14th century, using two very different forms of architecture. Seen from the north, where the main road carrying the general public made its way past, the castle had what Oliver Creighton terms a \\"martial facade\\" of traditional military defences, with narrow windows and towering defences.; Seen from the deer park on the south of the property, however, the castle's lodgings and accommodation were on full display, with low walls and large windows. A similar architectural dichotomy can be seen at Ludlow and Warkworth Castles. The park was effectively fused with the south side of the castle, with the chase running right up to the property. From the two large windows of the eastern lodgings, it would have been possible to gaze out across the parklands and appreciate the extensive views without seeing any trace of rural settlements or the nearby town.; The result, as historian Stephen Mileson describes, would have been \\"stunning\\". The barbican was built at the beginning of the 14th century and contained a guard-room on the first floor. The barbican contains numerous putlog holes from its construction, although these would have been masked by exterior plasterwork in the medieval period. A passageway led up from the barbican to the gatehouse, probably originally guarded by a drawbridge and containing the accommodation for the castle's constable. The castle bailey contained a number of buildings by the 14th century. On the north side were the Great Hall, the buttery and the castle kitchens, the former lit by a large decorative window and partitionedfrom the kitchen and buttery by a wooden screen. Above the buttery was a luxurious solar, or apartment. On the south side of the bailey were the western lodgings, well-equipped accommodation for guests, built by in-filling part of the ditch between the motte and the bailey, and later converted into a bakery. A chapel and accommodation for the castle's chaplain lay alongside, and the chapel has remaining plaster work, which shows that the walls were painted with red lines to resemble ashlar cut stone. On the far side of the chapel were the eastern lodgings, whose detailing mirrored those at Tiverton Castle, another de Courtenay property built in the same period.; Keep on the motte, showing the remains of the turret The motte, on the far side of the bailey, is predominantly made up of a natural rock outcrop, strengthened further with earth from the construction of the rest of the castle ditches.; It stands up to high and measures by at the top. The motte is separated from the main castle by ditches in a similar way to the motte at Windsor Castle. On top of the motte is the castle keep, originally built in the 11th century, with massive stone walls at least one storey high and possibly as high as three storeys, and then redeveloped as a two-storey structure with a rectangular addition on the western side in the early 14th century.; The 11th century parts of the keep make use of granite stone, probably taken from the river bed of the West Okement. The 14th century keep had two sets of lodgings on the upper floor, similar in style to those in the bailey, and a turret containing a staircase, some of which still survives.; The keep is unusual both for the period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong defensive structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison in the event of a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.

TCP Westwood+ is based on end-to-end bandwidth estimation to set congestion window and slow start threshold after a congestion episode, that is, after three duplicate acknowledgments or a timeout. The bandwidth is estimated by properly low-pass filtering the rate of returning acknowledgment packets. The rationale of this strategy is simple: in contrast with TCP Reno, which blindly halves the congestion window after three duplicate ACKs, TCP Westwood+ adaptively sets a slow start threshold and a congestion window which takes into account the bandwidth used at the time congestion is experienced. TCP Westwood+ significantly increases throughput over wireless links and fairness compared to TCP Reno/New Reno in wired networks. TCP Westwood+ is an evolution of TCP Westwood. The main idea of Westwood TCP, which is an end-to-end bandwidth estimation for setting control windows after congestion, was proposed by Saverio Mascolo. He came out with the idea after reading the chapter on TCP congestion control in the book Data Networks by Larry Peterson. The first implementation of TCP Westwood in ns2 was done at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1999. The name \\"Westwood\\" was chosen by S. Mascolo as due homage to the home of UCLA where he was a visiting researcher at that time. Main collaborators were prof. Mario Gerla, Dr. Claudio Casetti and Dr. Medy Senadidi. After that, Saverio Mascolo went back to Italy and \\"his evolution of Westwood TCP\\" was named Westwood+. The main novelty of Westwood+ was the algorithm used to estimate the available bandwidth end-to-end. In fact, it was soon discovered that the Westwood bandwidth estimation algorithm did not work well in the presence of reverse traffic due to ack compression. This phenomenon was explained in terms of aliasing effects. The new version Westwood+ was implemented for the first time in the kernel of Linux 2.2 by Roberto Ferorelli and in the kernel of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 by Angelo Dell'Aera, both working at Politecnico di Bari as undergraduate students in 2003 and 2004.

Legislation may regulate, or in some cases prohibit the use of dogs to hunt or flush wild animal species.  History  The use of scenthounds to track prey dates back to Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian times and in England, hunting with Agassaei hounds was popular before the Romans. In more modern times, hunting regulation has been encouraged by the animal welfare and animal rights movements out of concern for wildlife management and alleged cruelty.  France  Hunting is legal in France.  Germany  Contrary to popular belief, Germany was not the first country to have enacted national laws against animal cruelty (the British Parliament adopted the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 111 years earlier), and the process of adopting animal welfare legislation on state and local level began decades before the Nazis took power in 1933. In the 19th century, many aristocrats in the German Empire hunted with hounds on horseback, including Emperor Wilhelm II (r. 1888‚Äì1918). Hounds were used to pursue deer, wild boar, hares and foxes. However, in the late 1880s until the early 1900s, the nature conservation and animal protection movement in Germany started to form and began campaigning for legislation on animal welfare, including hunting. Although no national (imperial) laws were ever passed, several German states including the largest and most populous and powerful, Prussia, adopted laws on which wild animals received protected status and which could be hunted. This decentralised process of regulation resulted in a situation where hunting laws varied from state to state. During the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933), more state laws and local decrees were passed, while some national laws were drafted that were never enacted. For example, the Prussian Tier- und Pflanzenschutzverordnung ('Animal and Plant Protection Act') of 16 December 1929 protected 'all wild bird species native to Europe' with the exception of designated 'huntable' species (specified in the Prussian Hunting Regulation of 15 July 1907) and 13 unprotected bird species. The first time a national law on hunting was passed was the Reichsjagdgesetz ('Imperial Hunting Law') of 3 July 1934, during Adolf Hitler's government. This nationwide law superseded all seventeen state regulations that existed up until that point. It was closely modelled on the Weimar-era Prussian Tier- und Pflanzenschutzverordnung ('Animal and Plant Protection Act') of 16 December 1929. Hermann G√∂ring had a passion for shooting game and was appointed both Reichsforstmeister ('Imperial Master of Forestry') and Reichsjagdmeister ('Imperial Master of Hunting'). Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, hunting with hounds is legal and there are many hound packs in the country. Fox hunting is legal as foxes are not a protected species, but hunts must be registered and take place at only certain times of the year. Lamping, the night-time hunting of rabbits with lurcher dogs and bright lights, is legal. Hunting protected species is controlled under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012. It is illegal to hunt deer with dogs. Hunting of hares with dogs is also illegal.  United Kingdom  = England and Wales = Hunting of wild mammals in the traditional style is banned by the Hunting Act 2004. Earlier acts, such as the Protection of Animals Act 1911, the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 contained specific exemptions for hunting activities. = Scotland = In February 2002 the Scottish Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass legislation to ban hunting with hounds. MSPs decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Act came into effect on August 1, 2002. An article in The Guardian on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns.The Guardian (9 September 2004). A number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional mounted hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns \\"will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed \\"token guns\\" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional foxhunting.\\" Currently fox hunting takes place in Scotland as described in the Scotsman's article. There are eleven hunts in Scotland where the rules are more relaxed. The continuation of the stricter laws in England and Wales has been guaranteed by the Scottish National Party. There is currently no planned legislation to tighten the rules on the Scottish hunts giving the Scottish industry the advantage. = Northern Ireland = Fox hunting in Northern Ireland would have been banned had the Foster Bill become law. However, by the time of subsequent hunting legislation in the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Assembly had been established and the hunting issue had been devolved to that body. A Hunting Bill was introduced into the Northern Ireland Assembly but rejected in December 2010. United States In the United States federal system, the agency primarily responsible for wildlife management is the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a division of the United States Department of the Interior, a cabinet-level division, whose director reports directly to the president. Within these federal guidelines, most hunting regulation for non- migratory species rests within wildlife or agricultural departments at the state level. With fifty different states, this lends itself to a wide variety of diversity, especially for an activity such as fox hunting. Much more common than organised fox hunting is the hunting (usually by private individuals) of raccoons (Ursus lotor) with coonhounds, and where such hunting is practised, the two are often regulated similarly due to the method (which involves tracking or active pursuit by dogs). The red fox is protected in every state in which it is present (all except Hawaii), in contrast to its status in the UK. It is variously classified as a furbearer, small game or predator in state hunting and trapping regulations. The open and closed hunting seasons for fox (both red and gray) also vary by state. Pursuit of red fox while in possession of a firearm requires a hunting license (or in some cases a trapping license) in all states, and is generally restricted to a specific season (typically the winter months). In some states (such as Florida) it is illegal to chase fox with dogs while in possession of a firearm, although it is legal to chase them otherwise. In some western states the coyote is an unprotected species, and there are no restrictions on the methods used in hunting them. In these areas Hunt Clubs often pursue coyote instead of fox.

He has performed regularly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Monahan also holds the world record for \\"Longest Hug\\" at a time of 25 hours and 25 minutes, alongside fellow comedian Bob Slayer. They set this record at Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2013. Background Monahan's father was an Irish welder, who met Monahan's mother in a bank in Ahvaz, prior to the Iranian Revolution, where Monhen was born. When he was 3 he and his parents and siblings had to leave the country during the '79 revolution, in company with his brother and sister, the three- year-old Monahan had to pose as his grandparents' son, because only one boy per couple could leave the country. Monahan has two passports ‚Äì one Iranian and one Irish one, using his Irish passport for travelling. Career =Live performances= Monahan is a comedy festival regular and has performed solo shows in a number of cities including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester, and also at most major venues throughout the UK. He has also performed across the globe in countries including Dubai, Luxembourg and Germany. He has done shows which refer to the occasional racism he encountered growing up in Middlesbrough. During the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he has performed at the Gilded Balloon, including in August 2015 with his show The Disco Years. Also at the 2015 Edinburgh Fringe, he debuted a play which he wrote and in which he also performed. Monahan's humour relies heavily on audience interaction and an animated story-telling style that draws on his own experiences. He is known within comedy circles to \\"ignore the light\\", meaning he will eat into other comic's time or cause overall delays to the program. =Television= In August 2011, Monahan won the ITV stand-up comedy contest Show Me the Funny. Shortly after winning, he performed on The Comedy Annual, a one-off programme celebrating the year in comedy. On 10 March 2012, he participated in the BBC One programme Let's Dance for Sport Relief. He danced to \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" by Rihanna, but was eliminated by the public vote and did not go on to perform in the final the following week. In January 2014, Monahan participated in the second series of the ITV celebrity diving show Splash!. His first appearance on the show was in the third heat, which aired live on 18 January 2014.

They speak the Secoya language Pai Coca, which is part of the Western Tucanoan language group. In Ecuador the Secoya number about 400 people who for the most part are located in three settlements, Eno, San Pablo de Katitsiaya and Siecoya Remolino, all found on the banks of the Aguarico river. Their Ecuadorian territory covers 40.000 hectares along the Shushufindi, Aguarico, and Cuyabeno river in the state of Sucumbios. Until recently they shared territory with the Siona people, with whom they are sometimes considered a single population, although both peoples have independent governance. In Peru the Secoya population numbers about 700.http://www.peruecologico.com.pe/etnias_secoya.htm Despite having long managed their culture, the Secoyas are now in the process of being culturally assimilated to the rest of Ecuatorian society due to the presence of oil companies, missionary activity, and colonists from other parts of Ecuador. History The Secoyas have lived in the area between the Putamayo and Napo in what is now Colombia, Ecuador and Peru for centuries. In the 1930s the Secoya people were heavily affected by the rubber boom in the Amazon. As a result, some of the Secoya fled from the Santa Maria settlement in Peru and moved to Puerto Bolivar on the Cuyabeno river. This is also the cause of the split between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Secoyas. In 1974 the evangelical missionary group Summer Institute of Linguistics facilitated the relocation of some of the Puerto Bolivar Siona-Secoya to their present-day largest settlement San Pablo on the banks of Aguarico. Culture and Society The most important academic work on Secoya culture is William Vickers' \\"Cultural adaptation to Amazonian habitats : the Siona-Secoya of eastern Ecuador\\", published in 1976. He describes the Sionas and the Secoyas as a single group. The Secoya people are organized politically through the Secoya Indigenous Organization of Ecuador. They have been involved in a conflict with Occidental Petroleum over oil drilling in Block 15 of Ecuador. The most famous living Secoya is Ram√≥n Piaguaje.

A normal serving of espresso takes from 18 to 30 seconds to pull, and fills 25 to 60 millilitres, while a lungo may take up to a minute to pull, and might fill 130 to 170 millilitres. Extraction time of the dose is determined by the variety of coffee beans (usually a blend of Arabica and Robusta), their grind and the pressure of the machine. In French it is called caf√© allong√©.  Related beverages  A caff√® lungo should not be mistaken for a caff√® americano (an espresso with hot water added to it) or a long black (hot water with a short black added to it, which is the inverse order to an Americano and done to preserve the crema). In the lungo, all the water is brewed, and the lungo is generally shorter than an Americano or a long black. In comparison, the caff√® crema is a significantly longer drink, comparable in size to an Americano or long black. (This drink is rare in the English-speaking world.) Like the lungo, it is all brewed water, but is about twice as long as a lungo.  Flavour  As the amount of water is increased or decreased relative to a normal shot, the composition of the shot changes due to the fact that the flavour components of coffee dissolve at varying rates. For this reason, a long or short shot will not contain the same ratio of components that a normal shot contains. Therefore, a ristretto is not simply twice as \\"strong\\" as a regular shot, nor is a lungo simply half the strength. Moreover, since espresso is brewed under pressure, a lungo does not have the same taste or composition as coffee produced by other methods, even when made with the same ratio of water and ground coffee.  Brewing  Ristretto, normale, and lungo are relative terms without exact measurements. Nevertheless, a rough guide is a brewing ratio of 1:1 for ristretto, 1:2 for normale, and 1:3‚Äì1:4 for lungo ‚Äì a ristretto is thus 30 ml/1 oz (the foamy crema slightly increases this volume), normale is 60 ml/2 oz, and lungo is 90‚Äì120 ml/3‚Äì4 oz. By contrast, a caff√® crema will be approximately 180 ml/6 oz.

Game summary With the game-time temperature at , the coldest NFL game since the Ice Bowl of December 31, 1967, the first quarter contained nothing but punts and interceptions, with Cleveland's Ron Bolton and Oakland's Lester Hayes each recording a pick. Near the end of the quarter, Browns' quarterback Brian Sipe's 20-yard completion to Reggie Rucker sparked a drive inside the Raiders 30-yard line, but it ended with no points early in the second quarter when Don Cockroft missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. On Oakland's ensuing drive, quarterback Jim Plunkett lost a fumble while being sacked, but their defense kept the Browns in check and Cockroft missed another field goal try, this one from 30 yards out. Finally with 6:02 left in the second quarter, Bolton scored the first points of the day by recording his second interception from Plunkett and returning it 42 yards to the end zone. However, Cockroft's ensuing extra point was blocked by Ted Hendricks. After an exchange of punts, Oakland managed to get on the board, with Plunkett completing passes to Bob Chandler and Raymond Chester for gains of 15 and 26 yards on a 64-yard scoring drive. Mark van Eeghen finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds left in the half, making the score 7‚Äì6. On Cleveland's opening drive of the second half, a 28-yard kickoff return to the 40-yard line by Charles White started off a 48-yard drive that ended with Cockroft's 30-yard field goal, retaking the lead for the Browns, 9‚Äì7. Then after forcing a punt, Cleveland drove to the Raiders 24-yard line, but on a field goal attempt, holder Paul McDonald was unable to handle a bad snap and was downed for an 11-yard loss. Starting out their next drive on the Raiders 44 after a punt, Cleveland drove to the 9, featuring a 21-yard reception by Dave Logan to score on another 30-yard field goal from Cockroft, making the score 12‚Äì7 going into the fourth quarter.http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Greatest-Moments-1980-AFC- Divisional-Playoff/d85d64d5-6ffb-4f04-9321-bf85b95dacb5 Early in the final quarter, the Raiders took a 14‚Äì12 lead at the end of an 80-yard drive highlighted by Chester's 27-yard catch. On the last play, van Eeghen scored his second 1-yard touchdown run of the day. Later on, the Raiders had a chance to put the game away when they recovered a fumble from Sipe on the Browns' 24-yard line with 4:19 left in the game. But after moving to a 3rd and 1 situation on the 15, van Eeghen was stuffed for no gain on two consecutive plays, and Cleveland got the ball on downs. On the second play of the ensuing drive, Sipe completed a 29-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome, and then a 23-yarder to Greg Pruitt four plays later. Then Mike Pruitt ran the ball 14 yards to the Raiders' 14-yard line. Pruitt gained another yard on the next play, and the team called a timeout from the 13 with 49 seconds left. The play Trailing 14-12 with less than a minute remaining in the game, the Browns had the ball on the Raiders 13-yard line and were in position for a potential game-winning field goal. Browns quarterback Brian Sipe conferred with head coach Sam Rutigliano, who called a pass play, \\"Red Slot Right, Halfback Stay, 88,\\" and instructed Sipe to \\"throw it into Lake Erie\\" (throwing the ball out of play as it was only 2nd down), if the play was anything less than wide open.Henkel, Frank M., Cleveland Browns History, 2005 On the ensuing play, Sipe chose to force a pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome. However, the pass was intercepted in the end zone by Raiders safety Mike Davis, who had cut in front of Newsome's square-in pass route, putting an end to the Browns' season. Oakland subsequently advanced to the AFC conference championship, where they defeated the San Diego Chargers and went on to win Super Bowl XV over the Philadelphia Eagles. The logic behind trying for the touchdown was that Browns kicker Don Cockroft had previously missed two field goal attempts, had one extra point attempt blocked, and had another aborted following a bad snap. In addition, the weather was brutally cold and windy. \\"What many people don't know about that situation is that I was a long way from being 100 percent physically in 1980,\\" Cockroft said in a 2006 interview. \\"I had two herniated discs and needed four epidurals to just get through the season. I probably should have gone on IR.\\"King, Steve. Where are they Now?: Cockroft, Cleveland Browns. 2006-12-12 Cockroft was released by the Browns at the end of their 1981 training camp and retired soon after. Had the play been executed properly, it would have presumably resulted in a touchdown. The primary receiver, Dave Logan, was crossing left-to-right, had a step on his defender and was open at the six-yard line. Sipe misread the defensive back's movements and thought Logan was covered so he went to the secondary receiver and threw in traffic where it was intercepted. Furthermore, Cleveland's drive had occurred right after the Raiders themselves had blown a chance at a short field goal attempt, moving the ball to a 3rd and 1 situation on the Browns 15-yard line only to lose it by being stuffed for no gain on consecutive running plays. The play call itself has since become an infamous part of Cleveland sports lore, ranking with The Drive, The Fumble, The Catch, Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, The Shot, The Decision, and The Move as a bad memory that symbolizes the 52-year professional championship drought that had plagued the city, until the Cleveland Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals.

Description The Belle Vale area shares borders with Huyton, Netherley, Gateacre and Childwall. The main road in Belle Vale is Childwall Valley Road (B5178) running from Childwall through to Netherley. The old North Liverpool Extension Line (loop line) at the back of Hartsbourne Avenue is often considered to be the border between Belle Vale and the neighbouring districts of Childwall and Gateacre. Belle Vale District Centre has a number of amenities including a fire station, police station, health centre, large shopping centre,Belle Vale Shopping CentrePhotograph of shopping centre and also Belle Vale Park. The Belle Vale Junior football league now plays in nearby Netherley. The district is often linked with Childwall or Gateacre, which are neighbouring districts. The Belle Vale area is also divided with different housing estates having their own local names, such as Hartsbourne, Lee Park and Naylorsfield. You will also find past and modern references to the area being in Gateacre further adding to the confusion.Our Lady Gateacre District signage erected by Liverpool City Council in 2005 did not include Belle Vale as a distinct district leaving the area in somewhat of a quandary. Signs were put up on Childwall Valley Road saying Gateacre (southbound towards the shopping centre and Netherley) and Childwall (northbound towards Childwall). The centre of Belle Vale effectively falls within the area identified as Gateacre by the signs, with Childwall deemed to begin north of a new school and health centre. The area's identity as Belle Vale is recognised by the names of various local amenities including the health centre, shopping centre, police station and fire station. The postcode for Belle Vale is L25, which is also the postcode for nearby Woolton and Gateacre. History Belle Vale was historically part of the parish of Childwall and part of the township of Little Woolton.Little Woolton Little Woolton was absorbed into the City of Liverpool in 1913.Liverpool At the beginning of the 20th century Belle Vale was a hamlet within the rural district of Little Woolton. It consisted of cottages, farm buildings and Belle Vale Hall, an old twelve acre estate on the corner of Wambo Lane and Belle Vale Road. In 1901 Belle Vale Hall was owned by Thomas Harrison, a merchant and ship owner. Rex Harrison, the actor, who was related to the family, visited the hall when he was a boy. In the 1920s the estate became a fruit farm and traded as Belle Vale Orchards Ltd. The Hall was demolished in 1929. John Irwin Sons & Co. Ltd had a jam factory on the site in the 1930s and 1940s. After 1960 the factory produced spam, initially as Blue Cap Foods and later as Newforge. The site of the factory is now occupied by Morrisons supermarket and petrol station which opened in 2003. Part of the estate grounds survived to become Belle Vale Park.Beryl Plent & Mike Chitty. Gateacre & Belle Vale, 2009, pp. 55-56. The first church in the district was St Stephen's, Church of England, built between 1872 and 1874 in Belle Vale Road. It was initially used as a chapel of ease to Childwall church until Gateacre was made a parish in its own right in 1893 and St Stephen's became its parish church. It was designed by Liverpool architect Cornelius Sherlock who also designed Church Cottages next to the church. The cottages were built in 1880 by Sir Andrew Barclay Walker for his estate workers. The cottages remained part of the Walker estate until put up for auction in 1917. In the garden in front of the church there is a stone memorial cross inscribed with the names of those local men who died in the First World War and Second World War. The west window in the church was designed by Edward Burne-Jones for Morris & Co. and was a gift from Sir Andrew Barclay Walker in memory of his first wife who died in 1882.Beryl Plent & Mike Chitty. Gateacre & Belle Vale, 2009, pp. 62-64. Over one-thousand prefabricated homes were erected on land around the hamlet, named Belle Vale Estate Gateacre on the plans, between 1945-1947, to provide affordable rented accommodation for people whose homes were destroyed in bombing raids on the city during World War II, making it one of the largest Prefab communities in the country.Prefabs Its most famous former resident is Sir Terry Leahy, previously chief executive of Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket chain. Leahy is also President of the Belle Vale Prefab Project.BVPP NewsletterBelle Vale Prefab Project. More Prefab Days (Belle Vale Remembers), 2008, pp. 102-103. From the mid-1960s the Prefab estate was cleared. It was replaced by new housing and a shopping centre by the mid-1970s. Our Lady's Roman Catholic church, initially built on the Prefab estate in 1949, relocated from across the road from the current location of Gateacre School playing field to Hedgefield Road in 1965. Hartsbourne, Lee Park and Naylorsfield, beyond the Prefabs, were mostly retained as farm land until the 1960s when the land was acquired for development. Paul McCartney attended Joseph Williams Primary School, then in Sunnyfield Road on the Prefab estate, from 1949 to 1953. He travelled by bus to the school because of the shortage of school places in Speke where he lived. The site of the former school, now opposite Viennese Road and Dorchester Road, is part of housing development plans also involving other sites in the area. While an adjacent site was used to build a retirement living development called Joseph Williams Mews in 2015, the actual site of the former school remained vacant. In December 2015 Riverside informed residents that Compendium Living were ready to submit a planning application to build family homes for sale directly on the former Joseph Williams school site. Education Schools in Belle Vale include Childwall Valley Primary School, Belle Vale Community Primary School, Our Lady of the Assumption Roman Catholic Primary School and Belle Vale Sure Start. Gateacre School relocated to land off Hedgefield Road, including part of the former Reggie Smith Playing Fields, in 2011. The move funded by the Building Schools For The Future scheme cost ¬£30 million.New Gateacre School The football facilities formerly on the site were relocated to a new centre at nearby Caldway Drive in Netherley.

Instrumental concerts At the end of a concert, if there is prolonged applause, one more relatively short piece may be performed as an encore. In some modern circumstances, encores have come to be expected, and artists often plan their encores. Traditionally, in a concert that has a printed set list for the audience, encores are not listed, even when they are planned. A well-known example is the performance of the Radetzky March and The Blue Danube at the end of the Vienna New Year's Concert by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra; neither piece is ever listed in the official program, but they are traditionally played every year. Opera performances Beginning in the 18th century, if an aria was strongly applauded, it might be repeated. For example, at the premiere of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, 1 May 1786, and other early performances, \\"many pieces were encored, almost doubling the length of each performance\\".Solomon, Maynard (1996), Mozart: A Life, New York, HarperCollins, 1996, , p. 304 = ‚ÄòBans‚Äô on encores = For \\"Figaro\\", on 9 May 1786 Emperor Joseph II of Austria issued an order limiting encores. By tradition, some world-class opera houses, such as La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, officially discourage encores, especially for vocal solos, as encores were associated with less serious performances. In the mid-19th century, encores were officially banned in northern Italy, since the Austrian-Italian authorities felt they would lead to public disorder. In 1921, encores were forbidden at la Scala (in northern Italy), because the conductor Toscanini felt they would interrupt the pace of the opera and drew attention to individual singers as opposed to the work. Toscanini had, in 1887, been challenged to a duel after stubbornly refusing an aria's encore. Wagner was similarly against encores. The ban at the Metropolitan was explicit in the printed programs at the beginning of the 20th century, but was nevertheless often broken at the insistence of the audience. Encores at the Met became rarer later in the century. Popular music In most circumstances, it has become standard for rock, metal, and pop artists to give an encore; especially in large settings such as stadiums and arenas. It is very common for punk bands to perform an encore when in small venues. Artists often plan their encores in advance, and they are commonly included on the artist's setlist; one common practice is to leave one or more of their most popular songs for an encore. However, encores are usually only performed by the headlining artist, as opening bands almost always have restrictions on how long their set can last, and are prohibited from going over the set time with an encore. Some artists include their encore as the second half of the concert. For example, the Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley and his band The Wailers were known to play the concerts of their last two tours in 1979 and 1980 in two halves: after the first half was performed they stopped performing for some minutes to tune their instruments again or to have a break, while the audience was demanding for more. They continued to play the concert with the \\"encore\\" which lasted about an hour. Sometimes they even played one or two additional songs (a \\"real\\" encore in the traditional sense, rather than an inevitable performance staged as an encore) after the planned encore. Similarly, former Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard generally plays songs from his solo career for the first half of his shows, and then, for the inevitable encore, will play a lengthy selection of Guided by Voices songs, with the two halves generally having roughly equal duration. In the early days of modern rock music, Elvis Presley never played encores, a practice his manager Col. Tom Parker intended to leave audiences wanting more. The now- famous phrase \\"Elvis has left the building\\" was used at the beginning of his career when Presley was not the headliner, followed by a plea for the audience to return to their seats so as to watch those artists following Presley. Once he became a headliner, it was invariably followed by a polite \\"thank you, and good night\\", to imply to those present at the concert that there was not going to be an encore. Jimmy Buffett is known for his intimate second encores at his concerts. He and his band leave the stage after performing their set and return for a typical encore of usually two songs and band introductions. Then they leave the stage again and Buffett comes back out on stage by himself for a second encore and performs an acoustic ballad to end the show. This final song is usually what his hardcore fans look forward to the most because it's a different song every show and usually an obscure selection; many fans consider Buffett's ballads to be his best songs despite not being among his famous songs. A collection of Buffett's second encores, entitled encores, was released in 2010. Morphine frontman Mark Sandman sometimes mocked the practice. At the close of Morphine shows, he would wave and say \\"Thank you! Good night!\\", but the band would remain in their places, and the lights would not be dimmed. After several minutes, the band would begin playing again. Boston played multiple shows with four encores throughout the 1980s. Both The Cure and Prince have been known to play a large number of songs in their encores, either in a long singular encore or spanning across multiple encores. The encore portions of their sets have sometimes lasted longer than the initial shows themselves. The Cure have played up to five encores on a handful of occasions and Prince has played up to seven. Etymology The word encore comes from the French encore , which means ‚Äòagain, some more‚Äô; however, it is not used this way in French, nor is ancora in Italian. French speakers commonly use instead either une autre (‚Äòanother‚Äô), un rappel (‚Äòa return, curtain call‚Äô) or the Latin bis (‚Äòsecond time‚Äô) in the same circumstances. Italians use bis, too, and, formerly, da capo (‚Äòfrom the beginning‚Äô). In England, [un']altra volta (Italian for ‚Äòanother time‚Äô) was used in the early nineteenth century, but such usage had been completely supplanted by 1900.\\"Altra Volta\\", in George Grove, ed., A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1900).

R.\\" David (born Elli Robert Fitoussi 1 January 1947, Menzel Bourguiba, Tunisia) is a Tunisian-born French singer. He is best known for his 1982 hit single \\"Words\\". Career F. R. David began his career as Robert Fitoussi, a Tunisian-born Jew who was a singer-songwriter and guitarist with French garage band Les Tr√®fles. After one EP, they mutated into Les Boots, but achieved very little commercial success. Adopting his new stage name, he went solo in 1967 and recorded some orchestral pop psych with Michel Colombier, including a version of the Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (\\"Il Est Plus Facile\\"). He enjoyed minor hits with the √âric Charden penned \\"Symphonie\\" and a cover of the Bee Gees' \\"Sir Geoffrey Saved the World\\", but this success did not last. He then created Aztec Records with Sonopress & Carrer and started producing with Michael Haubrich and they wrote and produced several groups. The first was called Cockpit, followed by David Cast, Doc & Prohibition Group, Ragga, Alain Maria, Freddy Meyer, and DD Daughterdydawn with Vangelis Papathanassiou. During the early 1970s, David formed the progressive rock group David Explosion but their one album was not a success. He worked with Vangelis for a while, appearing as vocalist on some of his early 1970s albums. David's voice is also heard on the 1974 single \\"Who\\" by Vangelis under the name 'Odyssey'. David then joined French rock band Les Variations, appearing on their final album Caf√© De Paris (1975), which featured an early rock-disco crossover \\"Superman, Superman\\". When the band broke up, he went solo again. His personal \\"trademarks\\" are his sunglasses and his guitar (a white Fender Stratocaster). His most recognised song was his hit \\"Words\\" in 1982, which sold eight million records worldwide, topped various charts around Europe in late 1982, and reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1983, surpassing a rival version by 1960s hitmakers the Tremeloes, and going on to becoming the 22nd best-selling single in the UK during 1983. The song appears in the Oscar- nominated film for Best Picture, Call Me by Your Name. The song is a catchy, slightly plaintive synth-led mid-tempo ballad sung in a slender, high-pitched voice. During the 1990s, he took time out from his own music career and focused on writing and composing for other well known artists. David released another album, Words ‚Äì '99 Version in 2000 which contains mostly covers. In 2009, he released the album Numbers, which was in collaboration with other musicians and featured songs that David himself most preferred.Site officiel. F. R. David. Retrieved 10 February 2013.

Antoni's works focus mostly on process and the transitions between the making and finished product. She often uses her body, both as an entity, or paying particular attention to body parts as tools, utilizing her mouth, hair, eyelashes, and, through technological scanning, the brain, to perform everyday activities to create her artwork. Her work blurs the distinction between performance art and sculpture. She currently resides in Brooklyn, New York.  Early life and education  Antoni was born January 19, 1964 in Freeport, Bahamas. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1986 with a B.A.degree. She received a M.F.A. degree in 1989 in Sculpture from Rhode Island School of Design. Career Tableau vivants, a static scene containing one or more actors or models, are an art form that Antoni has used in her work. In her installation Slumber (1994) Antoni slept in the gallery for 28 days and while she slept, an EEG machine recorded her REM patterns. Which she then wove into a blanket from the night gown under which she slept. This particular work was seen as a tableau vivant because of its spectacle aspect: > The aspirational focus of this tableau vivant, while situating the artist as > an object on view, insists on an aesthetics of connections: between the > artist and beholders, between the artists [sic] and the art institutions, > and between the artist's conscious and unconscious processes.Jennifer > Fisher. \\"Interdependence: The Live Tableaux of Suzanne Lacy, Janine Antoni, > and Marina Abramoviƒá.\\" Art Journal. vol. 56, no. 4 (winter, 1997), 28‚Äì33. Antoni explains this desire to be involved in the viewer's experience when she writes: > [Performance] wasn't something that I intended to do. I was doing work that > was about process, about the meaning of the making, trying to have a love- > hate relationship with the object. I always feel safer if I can bring the > viewer back to the making of it. I try to do that in a lot of different > ways, by residue, by touch, by these processes that are basic to all of our > lives... that people might relate to in terms of process... everyday > activities--bathing, eating, etc. But there are times when the best way to > keep people in that place, which for me is so alive and pertinent, is to > show the process or the making. She says of this performer/audience interaction: \\"This letter sums up my relationship to my audience. I have a deep love for the viewer; they are my imaginary friend.\\" Antoni has cited Louise Bourgeois as a strong artistic influence, referring to Bourgeois as her 'art mother.' Antoni's work is in various public museum collections, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), National Gallery of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, The Broad, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. She was interviewed for the 2010 documentary film, !Women Art Revolution.  Work  = Gnaw (1992) = In her work Gnaw (1992), Antoni used her mouth and the activity of eating or chewing to carve two 600 lb (300 kg) cubes, one made of chocolate and the other of lard. She used the chewed out bits to create chocolate boxes and lipstick tubes, which she then displayed in a mock store front. Antoni made a statement about her work saying \\"Lard is a stand-in for the female body, a feminine material, since females typically have a higher fat content than males, making the work somewhat cannibalistic\\". In this work and others, Antoni often confronts issues such as materiality, process, the body, cultural perceptions of femininity, and her art historical roots. = Loving Care (1993) = In Loving Care (1993), Antoni used her hair as a paintbrush and Loving Care hair dye as her paint. Antoni dipped her hair in a bucket of hair dye and mopped the gallery floor on her hands and knees and in the process pushed the viewers out of the gallery space. In this process Antoni explored the body, as well as themes of power, femininity, and the style of abstract expressionism. Her performance was at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery, London, in 1993. = Lick and Lather (1993) = In Lick and Lather (1993), Antoni produced fourteen busts, seven cast from chocolate and the other seven from soap. She then \\"re-sculpts\\" the busts by eating them (chocolate) and bathing herself (soap) as the title suggests. The installation critiques notions of feminine beauty and hygiene, suggested by the extreme manner that many of the busts' features become distorted through Antoni's actions. The soap represents the societal expectation that the female body must be perpetually cleaned, while the chocolate brings to mind stereotypical depictions of female menstrual cravings. In a 2012 interview with Adrian Heathfield, Antoni discussed the response of some audience members to 'Lick and Lather' as conceptually correct, when they have bitten into the work. She describes the work as \\"all about desire\\". = Tear (2008) = In Tear (2008), Antoni created a wrecking ball in lead and then used it to demolish a building synchronized with the blinking of her eyelid. Each impact damaged the surface of the ball, thus telling its history. The intention of this project was to leave the viewer to interpret the psychological reaction of danger. = Crowned (2013) = Her work Crowned (2013) was inspired after her giving birth in 2004 to her daughter. A sculpture of a wall with plaster crown moulding, that has two plaster pelvic bones protruding from the wall and is framed by plaster splashed around the objects. It visually resembles the second stage in childbirth called, \\"crowning\\", when the baby's head is surrounded by the vaginal orifice. = I Am Fertile Ground (2019) = I Am Fertile Ground (2019) was a site-specific installation in the catacombs of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Small photographs, close-ups of living bodies, are presented in gilded frames shaped to look like human bones. The work speaks to the fragility of the human form, surrounded as it was by the remains of some 560,000 individuals buried at Green-Wood, one of the earliest examples of a large park-like and varied in style cemetery, built in rural America.

The route continues as County Road 12 (CR 12) on both ends, on the western end running south to SR 65, and on the east running to US 319. Route description SR 12 in Liberty County SR 12 begins at SR 20 in Bristol, although originally it starts off heading in more of a northerly direction then curves more towards the east. The surroundings are primarily forestland, one side of which is burnt, until it reaches CR 270, a bi-county east-west route in Liberty and Gadsden Counties. Pine trees become more prominent after this and the next moderate intersection is with CR 1641 which spans southeast towards Hosford and northwest to Torreya State Park. The segment south of SR 12 used to be County Road 271. State Road 12 continues moving relatively northeast as it crosses the Liberty-Gadsden County Line and passes by the Poley Branch Church. From there it descends into a valley, but emerges from it before approaching the southern terminus of County Road 269, a road in western Gadsden County that runs as far north as Chattahoochee before crossing the Florida-Georgia State Line. Later, it curves from east to north around a small farm across from the western terminus of County Road 65D (Telogia Creek Road), a county road that eventually leads to a state road which will soon prove to be far more significant. The next intersection is CR 379 (Juniper Road). After SR 12 veers off to the right from Coleman Road it enters the City of Greensboro and then crosses an Apalachicola Northern Railroad line before curving back to the same direction. Within downtown Greensboro, SR 12 turns right at Selman Street joining a brief concurrency with CR 270. Three and a half blocks later CR 270 turns north onto Tolar White Road and SR 12 continues as Selman Street. The last non-local street in Greensboro is the western terminus of CR 274 (Providence Road). From there, SR 12 is named Greensboro Highway, which crosses a bridge over Telogia Creek at Shepards Pond, and shortly after this curves to the northeast to become a four-lane divided highway for the diamond interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) at exit 174. US 90 and SR 12 in downtown Quincy The divided segment comes to an end north of I-10 between Beaver Lake Road and Thomas Smith Farm Road. As SR 12 curves back toward the east, it encounters another section of CR 270 (Bassett Road) and the eastern terminus of CR 270A (Flat Creek Road), just before a wye intersection with SR 65 (Hosford Highway) where the west end of concurrency with the route begins. Immediately after this intersection SR 12/65 has another intersection with another one of SR 65's suffixed routes, specifically County Road 65A (Dewey Johnson Way) that leads north to Gretna. In Douglas City SRs 12/65 serves as the address for the Gadsden Correctional Facility, and then an at-grade crossing with the CSX Tallahassee Subdivision a line that carried the Amtrak Sunset Limited until it was truncated to New Orleans, Louisiana by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Right after this crossing SRs 12/65 has an intersection with U.S. Route 90, and joins that route in another concurrency. The Tallahassee Subdivision begins to move away from US 90/SRs 12/65, but almost comes back just before the intersection with CR 274 before entering Quincy where the concurrency becomes West Jefferson Street. Within the city the road encounters an at-grade railroad crossing with a spur of the Tallahassee Subdivision. This spur runs next to the beginning of the concurrency with SR 267 and CR 268 once again. The concurrency with SR 267 may have been in the process of being eliminated though, as a four-lane stub extends a block north of US 90. US 90/SRs 12/65/267/CR 268 enter the Quincy Historic District at Stewart Street. Four blocks later at Adams Street, SR 267 leave US 90 to the north, and CR 268 turns in the opposite direction. Between there it runs in front of the Gadsden County Courthouse and a block later at Madison Street, passes the former routing of SR 12\\\\. US 90 and SR 12 head east out of the city and at SR 269, SR 12 turns north off the US 90 concurrency. At Quincy Municipal Airport and East King Street (the former routing of SR 12), SR 269 ends and SR 12 turns east onto Havana Highway. The road veers off to the right at the southern terminus of CR 161 (Point Milligan Road) where a small gas station can be found at the fork between the two roads. In Shady Rest the eastern segment of CR 270 (Shady Rest Road) runs southeast to Scotland and Gibson, while SR 12 curves along the north side of Lake Tallavana. Curving back to the east, the route runs past five churches then approaches CR 159 (Salem Road) where Havana Highway is changed to Ninth Avenue West. At the same time, CR 159 joins SR 12 in a one block unsigned concurrency that lasts until the intersection of SR 159\\\\. Finally entering Havana the road crosses a CSX Railroad line and curves straight east just before the eastern terminus at US 27. However Ninth Avenue East continues eastward as CR 12A. History East King Street and former segment of SR 12 in Quincy The entire route originally was a longer state highway that included current county extensions. From 1926 to 1949 the segment between Quincy and Havana was part of US 90, and was part of US 90 Alternate only in 1950. In 2017, two years after the opening of the Quincy Bypass (SR 269) to help remove through truck traffic away from the city's downtown narrow roads, Quincy formally requested the removal of SR 12 from Madison Street and East King Street. Major intersections Related routes =Liberty County= County Road 12 County Road 12 is a county extension of SR 12. It begins at State Road 65 in Wilma and runs northwest to SR 20 in Bristol just west of the western terminus of SR 12. County Road 12A County Road 12A is a suffixed alternate of County Road 12 located South of Bristol. It is a loop road to the west of CR 12 around Lake Mystic, appropriately named Lake Mystic Road. =Gadsden and Leon counties= SR 269 State Road 269 (SR 269) is a two-lane state highway located east of downtown Quincy. Most of the roadway is within city limits though some portions are in unincorporated parts of Gadsden County. SR 269 runs from US 90/SR 10 and Ralph Strong Road north to East King Street and C&E; Farm Road near the Quincy Municipal Airport. SR 12 runs concurrent with the entire length of SR 269\\\\. The road heads through forested land, crossing Quincy Creek towards the midpoint of the road, and has no driveways off of it. It is officially designed the Julia Munroe Woodward named for a longtime Quincy resident and philanthropist. The road opened in January 2015 to help remove truck traffic on SR 12's narrow roads through Quincy. Since 2017, it is fully co-signed with SR 12 once the city took over maintenance from FDOT of SR 12 along Madison Street and East King Street. County Road 12 County Road 12 in Gadsden and Leon Counties is a bi-county extension of SR 12. The route begins three blocks north of the eastern terminus of State Road 12 at US 27 as Fifth Avenue East. Upon leaving the town limits it becomes Fairbanks Ferry Road, where it curves more toward the northeast until it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 12B. Entering Concord, the road intersects CR 157, a bi-county extension of SR 157 in Tallahassee. Further east it serves as the southern terminus of CR 157A. Upon crossing Fairbanks Ferry Bridge over the Ochlockonee River, the northernmost bridge along the river in Florida, the road enters Leon County. Fairbanks Ferry Road ends at CR 155, which it has a brief southbound concurrency with before turning east again. Along this segment, the route serves as the headquarters for WVUP-CD, a Christian television station. In Iamonia, CR 12 divides just before ending at US 319 and has its own median within the median of US 319. County Road 12A County Road 12A is a suffixed alternate of State Road 12. It begins at the eastern terminus of SR 12 and ends at CR 157. It may have possibly had a concurrency with CR 157 leading to CR 12 in Concord at one time. County Road 12B County Road 12B is another suffixed alternate of State Road 12. It begins at US 27 north of Havana and end at CR 12 west of CR 157 in Concord.

It runs from Crystal River on the Gulf of Mexico east to New Smyrna Beach on the Atlantic Ocean, passing through Inverness, Wildwood, Leesburg and DeLand. A section in Lake County, between eastern Leesburg and a point north of Mount Dora, is concurrent with U.S. Highway 441 (SR 500).FDOT GIS data This concurrency is not signed; signs on US 441 mark it as TO SR 44. The former alignment of SR 44 in that area is now mostly County Road 44, which runs north of Lake Eustis, on the other side as US 441 and current SR 44. A former western extension of SR 44 from Crystal River to the Gulf of Mexico is now County Road 44. In some locations, it is signed as County Road 44W. Route description =Crystal River to Inverness= SR 44 as a divided highway west of Inverness. State Road 44 begins as Gulf-to-Lakes Highway at the intersection of US 19-98 and 4th Street in Crystal River, a four-lane divided highway. The divider only exists at the intersection, however. The rest of the road is undivided throughout much of Western Citrus County. SR 44 runs directly east, until it leaves the city limits, then makes a sharper southeastern turn prior to the intersection of North Dunkenfield Avenue and West Norvell Bryant Highway (County Road 486). It briefly turns east again as it reaches the intersection of Rock Crusher Road, but curves back to the southeast roughly a mile later. The proposed interchange with the Suncoast Parkway Extension will be built just northwest of where the divider begins again near the intersection of County Road 490 in Lecanto, after which the road turns east again. After crossing Lecanto Highway (County Road 491), the divider becomes more prominent, The road runs up and down various hills as it runs along the northern border of Withlacoochee State Forest, and though it never stays straight, it still runs mostly east. Near a pair of shopping centers, the divider ends east of Croft Avenue, and the road resumes its status as an undivided four-lane highway with center-left turn lanes. Entering the Inverness City Limits, the road straightens out again at the intersection of South Pleasant Grove Road(County Road 581) and Forest Drive, where it becomes Main Street. CR 581 secretly joins SR 44 as a hidden route. One block before CR 581 leaves SR 44 to become its own route again, southbound US 41 joins SR 44. The two routes continue to move directly east until the intersection of Seminole Avenue, where it curves around the Old Citrus County Courthouse, and then moves to the southeast before breaking off at East Highland Boulevard, where US 41 continues towards Floral City, Brooksville, Tampa, and points south, while SR 44 moves onto Gulf-Atlantic Highway and becomes a divided highway once again. =Inverness to Leesburg= East of US 41, SR 44 runs over the Withlacoochee State Trail with bike ramps on both sides, and then along the southern shore of Henderson Lake. The rest of the road is surrounded by farms, parkland, and boat launching areas, especially as it gets ready to cross the Withlacoochee River at the Citrus-Sumter County Line, where it enters Rutland. The rural landscape continues even at the northwest end of County Road 470, which leads to Lake Panasoffkee, Sumterville, and Okahumpka in Lake County. The many truck stops and travel plazas on SR 44 at Interstate 75 in Wildwood. Florida's Turnpike is nearby on the southbound on-ramp. As the road enters Wildwood it is lined with truck stops, travel plazas, hotels, and other tourist attractions surrounding the interchange with Interstate 75 as well as Florida's Turnpike. The Florida Department of Transportation and Florida's Turnpike Enterprise are planning to combine the ramps to and from the turnpike into those of I-75. The road curves to the southeast again, as it approaches the western terminus of County Road 44A. After straightening out again, it approaches a four lane bridge over the CSX Wildwood Subdivision that was completed in 2010, just before the road intersects with US 301. East of US 301, the road takes another slight southeastern curve and later meets the eastern terminus of County Road 44A and then CR 468 in Orange Home, just before crossing the Lake County Line. A former railroad line running from Wildwood to Leesburg that ran along the south side of CR 44A runs along the north side of the road, when CR 44A ends Before reaching Downtown Leesburg, SR 44 makes a sharp right turn onto a truck bypass at the intersection of Main Street and County Road 468. The name of this section is South Street and it runs north and south, until it takes a sharp curve at Casteen Road, which it replaces. South Street continues to run in its easterly direction and approaches Venture Avenue, which was built on a former southwest-to-northeast railroad right-of-way, and Carpenter Avenue which runs along the east side of this former ROW. SR 44 approaches the intersection of US 27, and turns into West Dixie Avenue, where it runs northeast momentarily, and then turns east again. At the intersection of South Palmetto Street and west end of Dozier Circle, West Dixie Avenue turns into East Dixie Avenue. The road curves to the northeast again at Lake Port Boulevard and crosses the same abandoned railroad line that originated in Wildwood. Right after the intersection of East Main Street, SR 44 joins Southbound US 441, but both continue to run east. =Leesburg to Mount Dora= The US 441-SR 44 segment is a six-lane divided highway with provisions for bicycles. The road serves as the western terminus of County Road 44 then passed by Leesburg Municipal Airport. From here it squeezes between Lake Harris and Lake Eustis where it crosses over the Dead River on a bridge between the two lakes. The southbound wye at State Road 19 in Tavares, is also shared by County Road Old 441, and northbound SR 19 joins US 441 and SR 44 through the rest of Tavares into Eustis until it encounters an interchange with State Road 19 and part of CR 19A. North of Mount Dora, SR 44 leaves US 441, which curves south towards Orlando and Miami. SR 44 turns north then narrows from four lanes to two lanes before it curves between Lake Joanna and Loch Leven before passing by the Mid Florida Air Service Airport in Eustis. From there the road turns right onto East Orange Avenue, which continues Route 44's status as a two lane rural scenic highway. =Seminole State Forest through DeLand= Before the road curves northeast, an intersection with County Road 46A gives motorists the option of taking a turn towards State Road 46. As the road curves and intersects County Road 44A, it enters Seminole State Forest. In Crow's Bluff, SR 44 serves as the eastern terminus of County Road (former State Road) 42 and immediately crosses the Francis P. Whitehair Bridge over the St. Johns River, where it enters Volusia County and curves back east. West of DeLand, SR 44 is named West New York Avenue and runs along a bridge over an Amtrak line north of DeLand (Amtrak station), but then crosses a grade crossing for a railroad spur leading from the station into Downtown DeLand. Motorists know they're getting close to Downtown DeLand itself when they intersect State Road 15A, but SR 44 doesn't actually enter downtown until it passes through the Downtown DeLand Historic District and approaches U.S. Route 17/92. Here, West New York Avenue becomes East New York Avenue, but no turns at this intersection are allowed from either direction. Access to US 17/92 is only available from nearby side roads two or more blocks away. The road begins to move southeast from Talmadge Gardens Road to East Voorhis Avenue then takes a south turn along the west coast of Lake Winnemisett and becomes a four-lane divided highway again at the south end of Lake Winnemisett. It then bypasses a former section of SR 44 just before it approaches Interstate 4, which contains partial cloverleaf ramps on the southwest and northeast corners of the bridge. =Toward New Smyrna Beach= East of I-4, SR 44 a four lane divided highway. SR 44 serves as the northern terminus of State Road 415 and the southern terminus of County Road 415, where the New Smyrna Speedway can be found on the northwest corner. O'Reilly Road, a gateway to a housing development is slated to become County Road 4009. A partial cloverleaf exists for Interstate 95, with separate westbound and eastbound off-ramps for southbound traffic. Northbound traffic uses a half- diamond interchange. When the road finally arrives within the New Smyrna Beach city limits, Florida State Road 44 Business branches off to the northwest as Canal Street, while SR 44 itself becomes Lytle Avenue. The final segment of SR 44 runs on top of a bridge that goes over the Florida East Coast Railroad Main Line and U.S. Route 1 where the road suddenly becomes a segment of State Road A1A. Access to and from US 1 is only available from SR A1A, unless motorists from SR 44 use side streets within New Smyrna Beach. History In Lake County, SR 44 originally passed through downtown Leesburg on Main Street, merging with US 441 east of downtown. It then split to the north on current County Road 44, passing north of Lake Eustis. North of Eustis, it turned southeast on present County Road 452, merging with State Road 19 into downtown Eustis, where it turned east on Orange Avenue to rejoin current SR 44 east of Eustis.Florida Department of Transportation, General Highway Map, Lake County, Florida, February 1969 (reprinted September 1978) The current alignment around the south side of Leesburg was taken over ca. 1986.Florida Department of Transportation, Pavement Management Office Report - Lake County (PDF) It had previously been State Road 468 from the west end to U.S. Highway 27 (SR 25) and State Road 33 from roughly Canal Street east to Main Street, but was given to the county by the early 1980s. At some point, SR 44 from US 441 east of Leesburg to State Road 19 north of Eustis was given to the county and numbered County Road 44; the route via US 441 and SR 19 south of Lake Eustis became SR 44. CR 44 has since been realigned to bypass Eustis to the north. SR 44 was realigned around downtown Eustis in 2005, taking over what had been County Road 44B between US 441 and SR 44 east of Eustis. The Florida Department of Transportation gave SR 44 west of CR 44B to Lake County. CR 44B had been marked from US 441 as a bypass to SR 44 east and from SR 44 as a bypass to US 441 south, as part of a longer bypass of Eustis also including County Road 44 north and west to SR 19. Major intersections Related roads =State Road 44 Business= State Road 44 Business is a state road in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. The latest GIS data has it listed as SR 44 even though there are two signs which have \\"business\\" tabs on them. Business 44 was the old alignment of SR 44 through downtown New Smyrna Beach. =County Road 44W (Citrus County)= County Road 44W exists as the western tip of old State Road 44, south of Crystal River. The suffix, \\"W\\", was most likely added to not confuse this section with State Road 44, to the north, and to show its location by being west of US 19 and US 98(SR 55). As with the majority of these type of 'coastal spur' routes, in West Central Florida, it is county maintained. =County Road 44A (Sumter County)= County Road 44A exists along the north side of State Road 44 in Wildwood and Orange Home. The road begins southeast of the interchange with Interstate 75, and instantly intersects with CR 225, which runs north and south, while CR 44A runs directly east and west until it curves slightly to the right and becomes Kilgore Street. The road then moves south onto Central Avenue running parallel to the CSX line until reaching Lynum Street, and crosses the tracks until Lynum Street terminates at US 301. County Road 44A then not only crosses US 301 to enter Huey Street, but the wye for the former Leesburg and Tavares railroad line. One block away, CR 44A breaks away from Huey Street and curves south before running along the north side of the right-of-way of the previously mentioned abandoned railroad line. The line contained a series of abandoned freight cars until the 2000s (decade), and the road and railroad line followed each other until CR 44A terminates at a recreational vehicle park in Orange Home. =Lake County= County Road 44 is a county highway in Lake County in the U.S. state of Florida. It runs from U.S. Route 441 near Leesburg in the west to State Road 44 near Mount Dora in the east. The western terminus County Road 44 is at an intersection with the concurrency of U.S. Route 441, State Road 44, and State Road 500 at the eastern edge of Leesburg, near Leesburg Regional Airport. From there, it heads northeast past Silver Lake, then east past Lake Eustis, before arriving in the town of Eustis. In Eustis, CR 44 intersects State Road 19. There, CR 44 splits into two branches. The northern branch heads east from the intersection to its terminus at County Road 44A. The southern branch continues south from the intersection, concurrent with SR 19, before turning east on East Orange Avenue. It then passes by Lake Joanna before terminating at State Road 44 between the towns of Eustis and Mount Dora. County Road 44 Leg A is a short spur near CR 44's western terminus in Leesburg. It serves as an alternate route for northbound US 441 traffic to reach eastbound CR 44. County Road 44A County Road 44A is an east/west county road in Lake County in the U.S. state of Florida. Its western terminus is at State Road 19 in Umatilla, and its eastern terminus is at State Road 44 about east of Mount Dora. The western terminus of County Road 44A is at an intersection with State Road 19 in the town of Umatilla. CR 44A heads out of Umatilla eastward on Rose Street before turning south. Then in Dalhousie Acres (near Lake Dalhousie), it intersects County Road 450A before continuing south towards Eustis. On the eastern edge of Eustis, CR 44A intersects one of the eastern termini of County Road 44 before turning east once again on DeLand Road. It then continues east on DeLand Road for approximately , passing by Black Bear Golf Club, before reaching its eastern terminus at State Road 44. County Road 44B County Road 44B, formerly a short north/south county route in the Mount Dora area. In 2004, CR 44B was turned over to State Road 44 when SR 44 was re-routed out of downtown Eustis, with SR 44 becoming a complete eastern and southern bypass of Eustis. The remaining portion of SR 44 through Eustis was reverted to CR 44, and remains unsigned to this day. County Road 44C County Road 44C, is Eudora Road, a short north/south county route also in the Mount Dora area. It spans from the convoluted intersection between Old County Road 441 and the eastern terminus of County Road 19A to US 441-SR 44 almost crossing the Mount Dora-Eustis border.

They were badly routed at the Battle of Middleburg, a blemish on an otherwise competent combat record. History The 1st Rhode Island Cavalry Regiment was organized between December 1861 and March 1862 at Pawtucket as the 1st New England Cavalry. Late in that month, the regiment was sent to Washington D.C. and initially assigned to Hatch's cavalry brigade in Nathaniel Banks' V Corps in the Department of the Shenandoah. Throughout the war, the regiment would be a part of many reorganizations of the cavalry, although the majority of its service was with the Army of the Potomac. Most of the regiment's service in 1862 was in northern Virginia, where it served as scouts to determine enemy movements, as well as foraging for supplies and screening infantry movements. The troopers saw action contesting Stonewall Jackson's cavalry in the Valley Campaign. They fought in the Second Bull Run Campaign, as well as many other battles of note, including service in the cavalry actions surrounding the Battle of Fredericksburg. In 1863, they participated in the Chancellorsville Campaign, and played an important role in the opening battle of the Gettysburg Campaign at Brandy Station. Shortly thereafter, isolated and alone deep in Confederate territory on a scouting mission, they lost nearly 240 of their 280 remaining men at the June 17 skirmish at Middleburg. The regiment was refitted with new recruits and performed scouting and outpost duty along the upper Potomac River until September, when they rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in the Bristoe Campaign and Mine Run Campaign. The following year, the 1st Rhode Island served in the defenses of Washington D.C. before eventually returning to the Shenandoah Valley under the command of Philip H. Sheridan. Due to heavy battle losses, the regiment was consolidated to a battalion of four companies on January 1, 1865. They continued serving in the valley for much of the rest of the war before being mustered out at Baltimore, Maryland on August 3, 1865. During the war, the regiment lost 1 officer and 16 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 2 officers and 77 enlisted men to disease. Hundreds more were wounded or captured. A total of 2,124 different men served in the regiment at various times, although its field strength normally was less than 500 effectives. Notable members * Captain George N.

It is the third entry in the Gamera film series, after the previous year's Gamera vs. Barugon. Gamera vs. Gyaos stars Kojiro Hongo, Kichijiro Ueda, Tatsuemon Kanamura, Reiko Kasahara, and Naoyuki Abe, with Teruo Aragaki portraying the giant turtle monster Gamera. Gamera vs. Gyaos was released theatrically in Japan on March 15, 1967. It was followed by Gamera vs. Viras the following year. Plot A series of volcanoes erupt in Japan. The eruption at Mt. Futago (in Shizuoka Prefecture) attracts Gamera, whose arrival is witnessed by a young boy named Eiichi. Gamera then climbs up and into the volcano. A research team is dispatched to the volcano to find Gamera and study the effects of the eruption. Meanwhile, Chuo Expressway Corporation is building a roadway nearby, but local villagers refuse to leave. The research team's helicopter is destroyed by a sonic beam emitted from a cave in the mountains. Reporters are informed that no bodies were found; but they are certain the culprit is neither Gamera nor the volcanic eruption. One of the reporters, Okabe, leaves for the site, and he and the roadcrew foreman, Shiro Tsutsumi, arrive at a protest area simultaneously. Okabe sneaks through the barrier, and Tsutsumi and his crew are turned away, as are the villager protesters, by the arrival of a young woman. The villagers return to inform the village headman of the happenings. The protests are a ploy to get more money for the land. The young woman is revealed to be Eiichi's older sister. The crew returns to find the work camp destroyed and a strange green glow coming from the mountain nearby. The work crew goes to investigate. Eiichi finds Okabe in the woods near Mt. Futago recording the same light the workmen saw. Okabe convinces Eiichi that it might be Gamera and the two make their way to a cave. A cave-in starts and Okabe runs away, leaving Eiichi in the cave. Upon exiting the cave, Okabe is eaten by a giant monster, which is later identified as Gyaos. The workmen enter the cave from a different opening and Eiichi makes his own way out of the cave, where he discovers Gyaos and is trapped by a falling rock. Gyaos grabs Eiichi and Gamera appears. Shiro and his crew arrive just in time to see a battle between Gamera and Gyaos, during the course of which Gyaos drops Eiichi, who is rescued by Gamera. Gyaos injures Gamera with its supersonic beam, but is forced to retreat after several blasts from Gamera's fire breath. Gamera rescues Eiichi and brings him safely to a nearby amusement park. Shiro uses the Ferris wheel to retrieve Eiichi from Gamera's back and Gamera flies away. Eiichi is interviewed about his experiences by Dr. Aoki and the Countermeasures Group, who have set up headquarters in the Hotel Hi-Land. It is Eiichi who calls the new monster \\"Gyaos\\" because of the sound it makes. Dr. Aoki explains Gyaos' abilities and that it was awakened by the volcanic eruptions. A squadron of aircraft attack Mt. Futago and Gyaos destroys them. Eiichi calls to Gamera, who is tending his wounds at the bottom of the sea. Gyaos attacks at night and all of the cattle in the village run away. During a meeting the next day, the villagers become divided on whether to sell their land or not because of Gyaos. Tsutsumi's entire crew, save two, also quits because of Gyaos. A rustling in the bushes scares the remaining men, who think it is Gyaos. Instead, Eiichi emerges and tells Tsutsumi that Gyaos only comes out at night. Tsutsumi reports this to Dr. Aoki and the defenders use light to make it too bright at night, without success. Gyaos annihilates the Japanese Self-Defense Force with a blast of wind and flies south to Nagoya. Gyaos wreaks havoc in the city and the people gather at the Chunichi Dragons stadium, where the lights have all been turned on. Gamera shows up and they battle in the skies over Nagoya. Gamera gains the upper hand because Gyaos' beams cannot penetrate Gamera's shell. Gyaos then extinguishes Gamera's flame breath with a yellow vapor. When Gamera hits the water, he bites Gyaos' foot and tries to hold him there until sunrise. Gyaos then severs his own toe and flies away. The toe is found washed up on the beach by some workers and is eventually brought to Dr. Aoki, where it is remarked that it has shrunk considerably since its discovery. Further experiments reveal that ultraviolet light causes the severed toe to shrink. Therefore, if Gyaos is out in the sun too long, it will die. Meanwhile, Gyaos has retreated to its cave and regrown its toe. Eiichi, along with his sister, bursts into the planning meeting and inadvertently gives Dr. Aoki the idea he needs: they will lure Gyaos out at night and immobilize him by making him dizzy using the rotating platform on top of the hotel. The Defense Force constructs another platform on top of the existing one with a giant bowl of artificial blood on it. With the help of Tsutsumi and his crew, they also build a viewing shelter. A delegation of villagers then appear and tell Tsutsumi they will no longer oppose the expressway. The headman appears and there seems to be some disagreement between the two sides. Gyaos is lured out, but the plan ultimately fails when the substation powering the motors explodes. Gyaos then destroys the hotel, extinguishes the substation fire with his vapor and flies away. Because of Gyaos the expressway is being rerouted, and the villagers, who were told by the headman to hold out, can now no longer sell their land. The villagers blame him and Eiichi comes out of the house, throws a tantrum, and berates the villagers for their greed. His sister also tells the villagers that the headman was acting in their best interests and the villagers leave. Back inside the house, Eiichi tells his sister that Gamera would finish Gyaos and that starting a forest fire on Mt. Futago will get Gamera to come. The headman goes to Tsutsumi and explains the plan. Tsutsumi tells the headman there will be a lot of money lost because of the destroyed trees, but the headman believes that Gyaos was sent as punishment for their greed. Tsutsumi and his crew use their construction equipment to prepare the area for the fire and an airstrike starts it. Gyaos appears and puts out the fire. The second time the fire is started, it attracts Gamera. A fierce battle ensues, which ends when Gamera immobilizes Gyaos and flies him to Mt. Fuji, where he then drags Gyaos into the crater to die and flies away. Cast Release Gamera vs. Gyaos was released theatrically in Japan on March 15, 1967. The film was never released theatrically in the United States, and was released directly to television by American International Television in 1967 as Return of the Giant Monsters. It was released to home video and reissued to television as Gamera vs. Gaos in 1987 by Sandy Frank, featuring a different dub commissioned by Daiei made in Hong Kong.

Along the way, it crosses the Wekiva River and, further east, the St. Johns River near the Econlockhatchee River. County Road 46 continues west from the western terminus to County Road Old 441 in Mount Dora. Route description State Road 46 begins as Sanford Road at an unnumbered diamond interchange with US 441, where it changes from a County Road to a State Road. After the intersection with Round Lake Road, SR 46 turns northeast and runs parallel to an abandoned railroad line, which it then curves away from, but then encounters at a former grade crossing in Sorrento just west of the intersection with County Road 437, which shares a brief concurrency with SR 46 for several blocks. East of Sorrento, the road becomes Sorrento Avenue, a name it maintains as it passes by County Road 435 in Mount Plymouth, and then Seminole State Forest. Before entering the forest however, SR 46 passes by Mount Plymouth Lake to the south and encounters the same right-of-way for the abandoned railroad to the north, which runs parallel to the road as even after it leaves the forest on a bridge over the Wekiva River at the Lake-Seminole County line becoming North Henderson Lane, and running along the south end of Lower Wekiva River Preserve State Park. After the intersections with Orange Avenue and Wayside Drive, SR 46 becomes a four lane divided highway before reaching the interchange with Interstate 4, and later joins a concurrency with U.S. Route 17/92, the latter of these routes is in a wrong-way concurrency. Along this segment, US 17/92/SR 46 passes by the Sanford SunRail station before it climbs a bridge over the CSX Sanford Subdivision then intersects Persimmon Avenue, a road leading to the Sanford Auto Train Station, and former passenger station. Eventually the triple- concurrency enters the City of Sanford where it is renamed West First Street. Closer to downtown Sanford the divider ends west of Avocado Avenue, but begins again before it turns south onto South French Avenue. During this triple- concurrency, US 17-92-SR 46 intersects a pair of railroad crossings at a junction of two freight lines, and then another one at the intersection of West 13th Street, also the western terminus of County Road 415. SR 46 then branches off to the east again at H.E. Thomas Jr. Parkway (County Road 46A) and 25th Street. SR 46 runs along the northern border of the Orlando Sanford International Airport, then after the southern terminus of State Road 415, uses a bridge over Lake Jesup at the Saint Johns River then become Geneva Avenue as it heads southeast. East of Geneva, the road crosses the St. Johns River itself using the Mims Bridge south of Lake Harney, and entering Volusia County. The journey through Volusia is short-lived though, because the road quickly enters Brevard County and turns straight east at Southmere, where it becomes Carpenter Road. SR 46 finally enters Mims in the vicinity of Interstate 95 at Exit 223, and then ends at US 1. Future SR 46's interchange with US 441 will be reconfigured from a diamond interchange to an at-grade intersection supplemented with two flyovers from SR 46 west to US 441 north, and from US 441 south to SR 46 east. Additionally, SR 46 will be truncated at its interchanges with SR 453 and SR 429 when the Wekiva Parkway is completed in 2022. The existing alignment will be renamed Sorrento Avenue. CR 46A's intersection with SR 46 will be relocated to decrease impacts to Seminole State Forest.

Consisting of a series of episodes in the story of the English outlaw Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, the novel compiles traditional material into a coherent narrative in a colorful, invented \\"old English\\" idiom that preserves some flavor of the ballads, and adapts it for children. The novel is notable for taking the subject of Robin Hood, which had been increasingly popular through the 19th century, in a new direction that influenced later writers, artists, and filmmakers through the next century.Chandler, John H. (2006).\\"Robin Hood: Development of a Popular Hero\\". From The Robin Hood Project at the University of Rochester. Retrieved February 24, 2016. Character  The plot follows Robin Hood as he becomes an outlaw after a conflict with foresters and through his many adventures and runs with the law. Each chapter tells a different tale of Robin as he recruits Merry Men, resists the authorities, and aids his fellow man. The popular stories of Little John defeating Robin in a fight with staffs, of Robin's besting at the hands of Friar Tuck, and of his collusion with Allan a Dale all appear. In the end, Robin and his men are pardoned by King Richard the Lionheart and his band are incorporated into the king's retinue, much to the dismay of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Development and significance Pyle had been submitting illustrated poems and fairy tales to New York publications since 1876, and had met with success. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood was the first novel he attempted. He took his material from Middle Age ballads and wove them into a cohesive story, altering them for coherence and the tastes of his child audience. For example, he included \\"Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar\\" in the narrative order to reintroduce Friar Tuck. He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw Allan a Dale to his sweetheart Ellen. In the original \\"A Gest of Robyn Hode\\", the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger. Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of David of Doncaster, one of Robin's band in the story \\"Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow\\". In his novelistic treatment of the tales, Pyle thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad, such as David of Doncaster or Arthur a Bland. Pyle's book continued the 19th-century trend of portraying Robin Hood as a heroic outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor; this portrayal contrasts with the Robin Hood of the ballads, where the protagonist is an out- and-out crook, whose crimes are motivated by personal gain rather than politics or a desire to help others. For instance, he modified the late 17th- century ballad \\"Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham\\", changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against an attempt on his life by one of the foresters. Pyle has Robin kill only one man, who shoots at him first. Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as the late 18th-century ballad \\"Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford\\", so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor. Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy, but he renamed the queen-consort in the story \\"Robin Hood and Queen Katherine\\" as Eleanor (of Aquitaine). This made her compatible historically with King Richard the Lion-Hearted, with whom Robin eventually makes peace. The novel was first published by Scribner's in 1883, and met with immediate success, ushering in a new era of Robin Hood stories. It helped solidify the image of a heroic Robin Hood, which had begun in earlier works such as Walter Scott's 1819 novel Ivanhoe. In Pyle's wake, Robin Hood has become a staunch philanthropist protecting innocents against increasingly aggressive villains. Along with the publication of the Child Ballads by Francis James Child, which included most of the surviving Robin Hood ballads, Pyle's novel helped increase the popularity of the Robin Hood legend in the United States. The Merry Adventures also had an effect on subsequent children's literature. It helped move the Robin Hood legend out of the realm of penny dreadfuls and into the realm of respected children's books.Wright, Allen W. \\"Changes to the Legend: Children's Stories and Comic Operas\\". From Wolfshead Through the Ages: The History of Robin Hood. Retrieved November 22, 2008. After Pyle, Robin Hood became an increasingly popular subject for children's books: Louis Rhead's Bold Robin Hood and His Outlaw Band (1912) and Paul Creswick's Robin Hood (1917), illustrated by Pyle's pupil N. C. Wyeth, were children's novels after Pyle's fashion.Allen and Allen, p. 202.

The station joined the network in November 1991, following the opening of the line between Bank Foot and Airport. The majority of the route was already in place, with the alignment having been formerly served by the Ponteland and Darras Hall branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The Airport branch only required the construction of a short distance (around 0.2 miles) of new right-of-way. Callerton Parkway is situated close to the site of the former Callerton station, which was located to the north west of the level crossing on Callerton Lane. The station opened to passengers in June 1905, consisting of a single platform, simple pitched roof station building, and a signal box. The line closed to passengers in June 1929, with goods services operating until November 1965. In 2008, traffic enforcement cameras were installed at the station's level crossing ‚Äì this having been the location of over half of the road traffic incidents at the five Metro-owned level crossings on the network. Similar cameras were installed at nearby Bank Foot and Kingston Park in October 2012. In 2018, the station, along with others on the Airport branch, were refurbished as part of the Metro: All Change programme. The project saw improvements to accessibility, security and energy efficiency, as well as the re-branding of the station to the new black and white corporate colour scheme. The station was used by 170,716 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the ninth-least-used station on the network.  Facilities  Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramped access to both platforms at Callerton Parkway.

It was one of the most respected Union volunteer cavalry units in the war. History The regiment was organized August 29, 1861, at Camp Cameron near Harrisburg. It was composed of 12 companies, mostly recruited from the counties of south-central and southeast Pennsylvania. Its officers were Col. Edward C. Williams, Lt. Col. Thomas C. James, Major Charles A. Appel and Maj. Thomas Jefferson Jordan. Williams was a famous soldier in central Pennsylvania, a bookbinder from Harrisburg who had been a hero in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. James had served as Captain of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry, a militia unit active since before the Revolutionary War. He brought a great knowledge of cavalry organization and tactics. Jordan served until the end of the war, attaining the rank of Brevet Brigadier General. The original officers of the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry were politically appointed, but many had previous military experience. After recruitment and initial training, the regiment was sent to Kentucky, where it was assigned to the Department of the Cumberland and given additional training. In March, it was ordered into Tennessee, where it fought several battles over the next few months with John Hunt Morgan's Confederate cavalry, capturing hundreds of his men, including his second-in-command and his quartermaster. After the Battle of Richmond on August 30, 1862, it covered the retreat of the Union Army of Kentucky along with the 9th Kentucky Cavalry. Being assigned to the Army of the Ohio, it saw only some skirmishing at the Battle of Perryville on October 8, 1862. Near the end of January 1863, Colonel Williams resigned his commission and Lieutenant Colonel James died, leaving Major Jordan in command of the 9th. During the Chickamauga campaign during the late summer of 1863, the regiment fought in several skirmishes and captured part of the advance guard of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps. During the Battle of Chickamauga, it guarded the right flank of the Union army, and, after the rout of the Union left wing, continued fighting with Thomas. In April 1864, the regiment re-enlisted and was given a furlough so it could return to Pennsylvania to recruit more men. The 9th helped defeat Morgan during another of his raids into Kentucky and in September fought Joseph Wheeler's raid into Tennessee.Unit history at the Pennsylvania in the Civil War site After this, it joined Sherman in his march to the sea and later in his march through the Carolinas, fighting several times with Wheeler, including at the Battle of Griswoldville. During this time, Colonel Jordan was promoted to brigadier general and Lieutenant Colonel Kimmel was promoted to command of the regiment. On April 17, 1865, the 9th served as part of the escort who traveled with General Sherman to meet General Johnston at the Bennett Farm near Durham Station. After the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston's army at the Bennett Place in North Carolina, the 9th was mustered out at Lexington, Kentucky, and finally disbanded at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The 9th fought against the famous Confederate leaders Forrest, Wheeler and Morgan, among others. Even early in the war when Confederate cavalry was normally superior to most Union forces, the regiment won most of its encounters with the enemy.

The image is created by physically moving a radiation detector over the surface of a radioactive patient. It has become obsolete in medical imaging, largely replaced by the gamma camera since the late 1960s. History One of the first rectilinear scanners was developed by Benedict Cassen in 1950. Before then hand-held detectors had been used to locate radioactive materials in patients, but the Cassen system (designed for Iodine-131) combined a motor driven photomultiplier tube and printing mechanism. Subsequent developments improved the detection systems, movement, display and printing of images. Components Schematic of a basic rectilinear scanning system Cassen's original rectilinear scanner used calcium tungstate (CaWo4) crystal as the radiation detector. Later systems used a Sodium iodide (NaI) scintillator, as in a gamma camera. The detector must be connected by mechanical or elecronic means to an output system. This could be a simple light source over photographic film, dot matrix printer, oscilloscope or television screen. Mechanism The patient is administered with a radioactive pharmaceutical agent, such as iodine, which will naturally collect in the thyroid. The detector moves in a raster pattern over studied area of the patient, making a constant count rate. A collimator restricts detection to a small area directly below its position so that by the end of the scan emission from the whole study area has been detected. The output method is designed such that positional and detection information is maintained. For example when using a light source and film the light is moved in tandem with the detector, and the intensity of light produced increases with an increase in activity, producing dark areas on the film. Disadvantages include the very long imaging time (several minutes) due to the need to separately cover each target area, unlike a gamma camera which has a much larger field of view, and the motion artefacts this can result in.

Among its early leaders were Morgan Lewis Smith and Giles Alexander Smith, both of whom later became generals. The 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment was formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in the early summer of 1861. The regiment was a special project supported by General Nathaniel Lyon. Most of the volunteers in Missouri's early regiments were German immigrants, and Lyon supported the creation of a regiment of \\"native-born Americans\\" to demonstrate that the Union cause in Missouri had support beyond the German-American community.Congressman Francis P. Blair Jr., Colonel of the 1st Missouri Volunteer Infantry, supported the concept of an 'American' regiment in a June 1, 1861 Letter to President Lincoln: \\"I think the Zouave regiment ought to be received, for moral effect as well as for military purposes. it will be a counterpoise to the prejudice against the Germans.\\" Missouri Troops in Service During the Civil War, Dept of War, Record and Pension Office, Washington, 1902 p123. Ironically, the Eighth Missouri also ended up with a high percentage of immigrants. Many of its members were Irish Americans who had worked on the Mississippi River docks prior to the war, giving the regiment a distinct Celtic personality (an ironic result considering Lyon's goal of an ethnically \\"American\\" regiment).At the same time the \\"American Zouaves\\" was being recruited, a sister \\"Irish\\" regiment was being raised in Missouri. This was the 7th Missouri Infantry (\\"Irish Seventh\\"). Like the \\"American Zouaves\\" it was intended to demonstrate that Unionist support in Missouri extended beyond the ethnic-German community. In addition to its St Louis recruits, several companies were actually raised in other states. The Illinois and Minnesota volunteers joined the Eighth Missouri because their home state's quota for enlistments was full. The Eighth Missouri wore a distinctive uniform patterned after those of the French-North African Zouave units.Private William H. Bates, a veteran of Company H, 8th Missouri, provided a description of the regiment's unique \\"Zouave\\" uniform in a letter to his daughter: \\"the [short] zouave jacket was dark blue with trimming of red braid (blue braid could not be secured early in 1861); the shirt of coarse gray wool; the pants light blue wool (the regiment voted unanimously against the red, baggy zouave pants), and the [kepi type] cap of dark blue.\\" Gateway Heritage, Quarterly of the Missouri Historical Society, Vol 19, no.4, Spring 1999, p27 While most of the Zouave uniform elements were abandoned as the war progressed, the 8th Missouri apparently continued to wear their short, brightly decorated Zouave jackets throughout the war.Private Bates stated that he wore his \\"zouave\\" jacket through the end of his enlistment in 1864. In addition, a variety of soldier letters and photographs indicate that the enlisted troops of the \\"American Zouaves\\" wore at least the regiment's distinctive jacket through the war. 8th Missouri Volunteer Infantry (\\"American Zouaves\\"), 1861-1864, Plate No. 822, Military Uniforms of America, The Company of Military Historians, 2005. The regiment's first commander was Col. Morgan Lewis Smith, a New Yorker who had moved west to Missouri after serving as an enlisted man in the Regular Army. Under his firm hand, the 8th Missouri would become one of the finest units to serve in the Army of the Tennessee. M. L. Smith's brother, Giles Alexander Smith, also served in the regiment. The 8th Missouri saw extensive service during the first three years of the war in the Trans-Mississippi Theater and Western Theater, and built for itself an enviable reputation on the battlefield. The regiment first fought in Missouri in the summer of 1861 against pro-Southern guerrillas who were attacking U.S. Army supply trains-- for example, in Wentzville, Missouri. That autumn, the 8th Missouri participated in the Federal occupation of Paducah, Kentucky. In February 1862, the regiment fought its first major battle, the Battle of Fort Donelson, near Dover, Tennessee. Later that spring, it was heavily engaged in the second day's fighting at the Battle of Shiloh. After a two-month-long campaign, it was the first regiment to enter the strategic rail center of Corinth, Mississippi, following the Confederate evacuation in May 1862, and in late December, it took part in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou. In January 1863, it stormed the breastworks of Fort Hindman to capture Arkansas Post. The 8th Missouri saw considerable service in the Battle of Vicksburg, where eleven men of the regiment won the Medal of Honor in one day during the May 22, 1863, assault on Stockade Redan. The regiment marched on to participate in the Battle of Jackson, the Battle of Chattanooga, and the opening phases of the Atlanta Campaign. On June 25, 1864, the three-year enlistments of most of the regiment's members expired and they returned to their homes. Those who remained on active duty were consolidated into a battalion of two companies, and as such participated in the rest of the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman's March to the Sea. In February 1865, the remaining veterans of the 8th Missouri were attached as an extra company to the 6th Missouri Infantry. In this capacity, they took part in the Carolinas Campaign and the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., before being mustered out of service in June 1865. Notable members * Eight were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions on May 22, 1863, during the Siege of Vicksburg: **John G. K.

It manifests with sudden, unexplained pain and lameness that may shift from leg to leg, usually between 5 and 14 months of age, earning the nickname \\"growing pains. \\" Signs such as fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy can also be seen. The cause is unknown, but genetics, stress, infection, metabolism, or an autoimmune component may be factors. It has also been suggested that rapid growth and high-protein food are involved in the pathogenesis. Whole blood analysis may show an elevated white blood cell count; this finding lends support to the theory that panosteitis is due to an infection.Brooks, W. (2017, September 15). Panosteitis: Growing Pains in Dogs - Veterinary Partner. Retrieved March 19, 2019 from https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id;=4953019 Panosteitis is characterized histologically by an increase in activity of osteoblasts and fibroblasts in the periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow, resulting in fibrosis and the formation of connective tissue in the medullary cavity of the affected bone. Pain may be caused by increased pressure in the medullary cavity and the stimulation of pain receptors in the periosteum. The humerus is most commonly affected. Males are more commonly affected than females.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is often a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other possible causes of lameness have been ruled out, such as hypertrophic osteodystrophy and osteochondrosis dissecans. History, signalment, and clinical signs can help a veterinarian form a presumptive diagnosis. On physical exam, the dog may display signs of pain on palpation of the long bones of the limbs. X-rays may show an increased density in the medullary cavity of the affected bones, often near the nutrient foramen (where the blood vessels enter the bone). This evidence may not be present for up to ten days after lameness begins.  Treatment  Treatment consists of alleviating the pain and inflammation so that the dog is comfortable. This is achieved with the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, like carprofen. Steroids may be given in more severe cases to reduce inflammation. It is also recommended to limit physical activity during treatment to prevent exacerbating the condition with high impacts.Johnson, A. (2014). Small Animal Pathology for Veterinarian Technicians. Hoboken: Wiley Blackwell. Lameness usually goes away after days to weeks without additional treatment. Recurrences up to the age of two years may occur. Larger breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs, Golden Retrievers, Basset Hounds, Dobermanns, Labrador Retrievers, and Rottweilers, are more prone to this problem. There has been one suspected case of panosteitis in a fast-growing six-month-old camel with a shifting leg lameness. Panosteitis is also referred to as eosinophilic panosteitis, enostosis, endosteal proliferation of new bone, and eopan.

Written by guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus, the song became the band's debut single and their first to receive radio airplay. \\"M+M's\\" is sung by Hoppus and the lyrics have a reference to masturbation. The band's label, Cargo Music, gave the band a small budget to film a music video, which was featured on numerous surf video compilations. In the clip, the trio steal items from their girlfriends but are confronted by them later in a gunfight. \\"M+M's\\" was later included on the band's Greatest Hits. Background \\"M+M's\\" originated from rehearsals in DeLonge's garage in the summer of 1994, when the band was preparing to record their debut album.Shooman, 2010. p. 24 The track was recorded at the famous Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles shortly after the band secured their label deal with Cargo Music.Hoppus, 2001. p. 31 \\"M+M's\\" is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. Journalist Joe Shooman described it as \\"Blink in microcosm,\\" commenting that, \\"in less than three minutes they nail their sonic colors to the mast.\\"Shooman, 2010. p. 25 After Cheshire Cat was completed, producer O contacted his friend Mike Halloran of XETRA-FM (branded on-air as 91X), who was a fan of the band, to determine the album's lead single. \\"We went over the songs to figure out if there was a track that would stand up to the huge bands of the day: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, etc.,\\" Halloran wrote in 2000. Between \\"M+M's\\" and \\"Wasting Time\\", the former won, and began to receive regular rotation.Hoppus, 2001. p. 35 DeLonge first heard the song in his car and rolled down his windows, yelling at passersby to \\"turn their damn radios on,\\" while Hoppus later likened it to a scene from the film That Thing You Do!.Hoppus, 2001. p. 36 Within two weeks, it was the #1 most requested track on the station, which made Halloran question whether its success was just Blink fans jamming request lines. The radio success of \\"M+M's\\" helped bolster their profile locally within San Diego, as evidenced by larger crowds following the airplay. \\"We sat back and watched as those old shows at SOMA went from the half club to the full club‚Ä¶ jam packed with people of all ages,\\" wrote Halloran. Composition The song is composed in the key of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 168 beats per minute. Hoppus' vocal range spans from D#3 to C#4. \\"M+M's\\" is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. The track exemplifies the band's southern California skate punk sound. Journalist Joe Shooman described it as \\"Blink in microcosm,\\" commenting that, \\"in less than three minutes they nail their sonic colors to the mast.\\"Shooman, 2010. p. 25 Music video Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video, to be shot for under $10,000. Darren Doane, who had previously worked with MxPx and Pennywise, directed the video. In the clip, the trio wake up in the morning beside their girlfriends (played by hired models) and proceed to steal an item from them. They are confronted before a concert later by their significant others, and a gunfight ensues. The band's original vision was a bit different: \\"I wanted the M+M's video to be fifty guys lined up, and have us shooting at their nuts,\\" said DeLonge in 2001. \\"Just a whole video of slo- mo close-ups of these guys' nuts exploding.\\" The video was shot at Belmont Park and at SOMA, an all-ages punk and hardcore venue the band often headlined. Ken Duario co-directed the clip. Filming a video made the band gain confidence, although they had no plans to market the video. However, the band's new manager, Rick DeVoe, had connections that led to the track being used in various skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding videos. \\"M+M's\\" made its first appearance on Good Times, a surfing video directed by DeVoe's friend Taylor Steele.Shooman, 2010. p. 33 An employee of Cargo Music presented the video to MTV, but network executives \\"threw the tape out at first sight of the girls with guns,\\" remarking, \\"Why are you showing us this shit?\\"Hoppus, 2001. p. 38  Format and track listing  ;CD (1995) # \\"M+M's\\" ‚Äì 2:35 References * * Notes External links * * Category:Blink-182 songs Category:1995 songs Category:1995 debut singles Category:Songs written by Mark Hoppus Category:Songs written by Tom DeLonge Category:Songs about sexuality ","title":"M+M's"},{"id":"3639723","text":"Bed warmer from the Netherlands Electrical bed warmer (with a shielded electric bulb) in India, 1979 A bed warmer or warming pan was a common household item in countries with cold winters, especially in Europe.

Take care to have a big enough quantity of embers, above all some red cinders, when you want to heat a bed. Get it smouldering well before you use it, otherwise the fire will soon go out and the bed will not warm up. You must move the warming pan constantly to avoid scorching the sheets. A bed-wagon (moine), well-known and inexpensive, is a suitable alternative.\\". Cited by \\"Bed warmers\\", Old & Interesting website.

It is located on U.S. Highway 53 where it intersects Trinity Road. The mall, owned by Simon Property Group, features 103 stores and a food court. The mall's anchor stores are Men's Wearhouse, JCPenney, St. Louis County Auditor Service Center, Dick's Sporting Goods, DSW, Barnes & Noble, Ulta Beauty, Sport Clips, and AT&T.; There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Younkers and Sears. Dining options include Applebee's, Lucky's 13 Pub, Noodles & Company, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Chilly Billy's Frozen Yogurt.  History  The mall opened in 1973 and was expanded in 1987. When Mercantile Stores' Glass Block store was acquired by Dillard's, the anchor was then sold to Younkers.Glass Block aqcquired by Dillard's The front facade displays many of the stores along U.S. Highway 53.

However, as a small, three-screen theater, it faced strong competition from the larger 8 and 10 multiplex theaters that were built in the 1980s and 1990s, located with two miles (3 km) of the Mall. Additionally, the facility suffered from a lack of investment and was seriously showing its age by the mid-1990s. In the late 1990s, the Movies at Miller Hill Mall became a second-run theater, showing films between 6 and 12 months old; tickets cost $2. The entire section was torn down and the space became occupied by Grandma's Restaurants, a local chain of restaurants headquartered in Duluth's Canal Park.Grandma's Restaurants Originally, Grandma's established a clone of its popular Little Angies restaurant located in Canal Park, but it was closed shortly after. Grandma's replaced Little Angies with an original concept, The Great American Bar & Grill which closed in 2011.Great American Bar &Grill; The large sign for the Miller Hill Mall that stands on the edge of U.S Highway 53 was refurbished and repainted after the closure of the movie theater.

Its boundaries were roughly the CSX railroad tracks to the west, and what would become the Kentucky State Fair & Exposition Center and the airport on all other sides (initially these were farm land). Highland Park was originally built largely for workers at the nearby Louisville & Nashville Railroad yard, with professor and businessman T. C. H. Vance laying out streets in the 1880s. Its relatively common name was based on its elevated location in relation to surrounding areas, particularly Louisville. Vance's daughter gave the streets their Indian-themed names, such as Hiawatha and Wampum, which was a fashionable practice at the time. Highland Park incorporated as a city in 1890, and grew quickly to 323 families by 1900. The city would grow to include Beechmont and Wilder Park, before all were annexed by Louisville in 1922, after a 5-year court battle. While initially centered on Louisville Avenue, the city and neighborhood's main commercial district eventually became Park Boulevard, especially after a streetcar line was installed there in 1920. Much of the neighborhood was razed to make way for the Watterson Expressway after World War II and all of it was finally razed in the early 1990s as a part of airport expansion, a plan first announced in 1987. However, most of what was once Highland Park is now vacant, and has not been developed by the airport. The street pattern remains intact, but areas where houses once stood have been fenced off. In 2009, the Regional Airport Authority, which owns the former Highland Park land, released plans to develop the land and re-route Crittenden Drive around it. James Russell Lowell Elementary School was built in 1916 in Highland Park, at that time outside the Louisville city limits. It was known as the East Highland Park School. It was expanded in 1931 and demolished in 1993.

Geography Acerno is a large village located 40 km north-east of the provincial capital of Salerno at 727 metres above sea level in the valley of the Tusciano, a river which rises on the slopes of Monte Polveracchio. It lies within the Parco regionale Monti Picentini, a regional park of the Monti Picentini group in the Southern Apennines. The neighbouring municipalities are Giffoni Valle Piana, Montecorvino Rovella, Calabritto, Senerchia, Montella, Bagnoli Irpino and Olevano sul Tusciano. The communal territory has an elevation varying between 400 and 1790 metres above sea level. Outside of the town itself it is entirely uninhabited by humans: there are no satellite hamlets or even scattered dwellings under permanent habitation. It is rich in flora, however, with forests of maple, oak, chestnut, hazel, beech and alder, while the fauna includes golden eagles, dormice, wild cats, otters and wolves. The town therefore acts as a base for excursions to the mountains Monte Cervialto, Monte Polveracchio and Monte Acella the peaks reachable after hours of walking and climbing. Although Acerno does attract tourists, the economy is largely based on agriculture: especially sheep, cattle and pig farming, and cereal cultivation. History Acerno was founded by refugees from Picentia (today Pontecagnano), which had been destroyed by the Romans after the Second Punic War. The earliest known documentary reference however, preserved in the archives of the abbey of Cava de‚Äô Tirreni, dates from 1027 and refers to fruit growing in a place called Acerno. The origins of the name are uncertain, but a plausible derivation is from acer, the Latin for the maple tree: this was the view of Girolamo Olivieri, bishop of Cerno from 1525 to 1539, who reported to the Holy See that ‚Äòthe town is called Acerno from the multitude of maples.‚Äô =Feudalism= The comune was the centre of a feud for a long time amongst noble families and throughout the Middle Ages passed hands many times during the Kingdom of Naples. Around 1150, Guido da Acerno inherited the comune from his father Tommaso. On 17 August 1254, Pope Innocent IV granted Philip d'Acerno possession of Acerno, Castronuovo and various feudal estates. In 1272 Charles I of Anjou granted Acerno to his eldest son Charles, Prince of Salerno. In 1298 it fell under the ownership of Roger of Lauria and was later owned by William Vaccaro (1337), Roberto Grillo (1346), Francesco Guindazzo (1381) and Antonio de Muro (1445). In 1453 a university for Acerno and Calabritto was built. In 1469, Troiano Santomango became lord of Acerno, Calabritto and Muro, and on 11 September 1500 reached a financial agreement with other feudal lords over taxes. The territory was inherited by his son, Camillo Colonna Marcello, who after his father's death in 1534 owned the land until his death on 10 December 1558. He was succeeded by his son Pompeo, who in 1577 sold the land for 30,500 ducats to Diomedes, Marquis of Castiglione. Diomedes died on 2 October 1596 and was succeeded by his son Ascanio, who died on 12 August 1605 and was succeeded by his son, Fulvio. In 1619 he loaned the lands under Royal Assent and after a series of owners, including Pompeo Colonna, in 1665 the estate fell into the hands of Antonio Tocco. Tocco died on 5 March 1678 and was succeeded by his nephew Charles, who sold Acerno to Nicola Gascon, Knight of the Order of Alcantara. The Gascon family ran Acerno throughout much of the 18th century until 1777 when it was ceded to the Royal Court when Marquis Giuseppe Gascon, the last owner died without legitimate heirs. Girola Mascaro, President of the Royal House of Salermo was granted power of the territory in 1781 but with the end of feudalism in 1806, he was the last feudal lord of Acerno. The Italian 10th Engineer Battalion, 3rd Infantry Division on 12 September 1943 in Acerno repairing a bridge destroyed by the Germans. The Bishopric of Acerno dates back to the 11 or 12th century. The first bishop was named Pisano who was appointed in 1136, followed by Peter, who took part in the Lateran Council in 1179. Acerno lost its own bishopric in 1818 and today has been merged into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salerno-Campagna-Acerno in its present form since 30 September 1986. =World War II= During World War II, the Anglo-American air forces bombed Acerno, the first time in September, 1943, destroying part of the bishop's palace, the church of S. Maria degli Angeli as well as numerous blocks. On 16 September 1943 five German soldiers invaded the garden of Canon Carmine Sansone, and while they were busy gathering the fruit from the trees, were killed with precision fire from a rifle by the priest. The Germans then shelled the house of the canon, the priest escaped but his niece died in the event. =Contemporary age= The town was severely damaged in the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. Main sights The Cathedral of San Donato, built in 1444, has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. The interior has four paintings depicting the four Evangelists, the work of an artist called Pallas in 1797. The church of Our Lady of Grace, has an altar in polychrome marble, with the portrait of Our Lady of Grace crowned in the centre. There is also the remains of the castle that belonged to Roger of Lauria.

NiSource stated, \\"This law, enacted by Congress, encouraged companies like NiSource to accelerate capital investments to spur economic recovery by permitting portions of these investments to be deducted at an accelerated rate. Only the timing of the deductions was changed, and not the amount that could be deducted. This means our income tax expense will likely be higher in the future.\\"Tweh, Bowdeya (4 November 2011), \\"Report: NiSource among companies getting large tax breaks\\", The Times of Northwest Indiana, retrieved 2 September 2015. Massachusetts gas line explosions and exit from Massachusetts On September 13, 2018, 80 homes in Andover, Massachusetts, Lawrence, Massachusetts, and North Andover, Massachusetts, simultaneously exploded and caught fire due to issues with gas lines owned by Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, a subsidiary of NiSource. At least 25 people were injured and one was killed; residents from parts of three towns had to be evacuated for a few days and electricity service turned off until the area was inspected for gas. Gas service to 8,600 customers was disrupted, in some cases for months. Columbia Gas admitted that maintenance workers mishandled sensors that monitored gas line pressure, and pled guilty to violating the federal Pipeline Safety Act. The company paid a fine of $53 million, in addition to a $143 million settlement with residents and businesses, $83 million paid to municipalities, undisclosed amounts paid for injuries and one death, and direct spending on replacing damaged pipelines and appliances. NiSource agreed to sell its Massachusetts gas business to competitor Eversource, at a loss compared to what it paid to acquire Columbia Gas.Columbia Gas Will Leave Mass.

It was commercially and critically successful in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was Elton's first novel, and launched his writing career. Stark was reprinted 23 times in its first year, and ultimately sold well over a million copies, making Elton one of a small number of novelists to sell more than a million copies of their first book.Ben Elton, Stark (Black Swan edition, 2006), Copyright notice.Gilchrist, Jim: Doyle variety performance, The Scotsman, 9 July 2007 The novel was adapted into Stark, a television miniseries. It is a comedy with environmental themes. The comedy style has been compared with the literary works of Douglas Adams and Grant Naylor.Illiterarty It is set mainly in Australia, in a dystopian near-future, and the lead protagonist is an expat Englishman. The story is told from the point of view of a large number of characters, and the point of view often temporarily shifts to that of an animal. Much of the early plot takes place in Carlton, a fictional town south of Perth, Western Australia. Most of the rest of the novel takes place in Kalgoorkatta and Bullens Creek, in the Western Australian desert. The final scene takes place at an unspecified location in outer space, perhaps on the Moon. Themes The novel is largely a satire of business, government and social attitudes toward environmentalism during the late 1980s. It describes a world in which big business and the ultra-rich are uncaring. It also skewers environmental activists as being unwilling to take decisive action or willing to take actions that are self-destructive and ineffectual. The book often deals with serious themes and then delivers comic relief. These comic diversions usually come to an abrupt end, often due to the hapless sudden death of a gag character. The comedy draws on Elton's typical fodder. The book contains crude and cringe humour, with characters who often experience flatulence and drunkenness, and running afoul of the law. The narrative also pokes fun at religion, place names and foreigners. The capricious and sometimes unjust nature of male-female relationships is a constant theme. Corporate culture and military culture are ridiculed. As in much of Elton's comic work, the central character is an unsuccessful, self-loathing, 'farty' skinny Englishman who has trouble relating to women. The book's prominent themes include: * Air pollution * The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament * Displacement of Indigenous Australians from their land * Far right politics * Finance * Global warming * Nuclear power * Racism * Recreational drug use * Unrequited love * Uranium mining * White supremacy Synopsis Colin \\"CD\\" Dobson lives a humdrum life at a critical point in history. The environment is being destroyed by a series of 'avalanches' ‚Äì sudden upsets in the Earth's ecosystem, causing widespread destruction. The Stark conspiracy is a cabal of the world's richest and most influential men, who have long been aware that the planet's ecosystem is approaching total collapse. For decades, they have been launching unmanned spacecraft loaded with supplies into orbit around the Earth and the Moon. Seeking to save their own lives and leave everyone else to suffer from 'total toxic overload', they secretly build a fleet of spacecraft with the intention of colonising the Moon. Using crude intimidation, they purchase land from aborigines in Western Australia to use as a launch site. They sell their stocks and commodities to raise cash, dumping the assets at the same time and in high volumes to engineer a worldwide stock market crash and lower the price of the resources they need. They buy the Moon from the United States government, along with the hardware to reach it. Six vessels are designed to travel to the Moon, three of which will carry humans, with room for 250 humans on each. The vessels are named 'Star Arks', referencing the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. The Star Arks contain human and animal embryos in suspended animation, as well as resources needed for life support. The Star Arks are prepared under the cover story that the consortium is building a desert resort. CD and his friends form a group called 'EcoAction'. Each of them has their own reason for fighting the consortium, with the collective goal of trying to protect the environment. They take action against the consortium's activities, and in the process uncover the conspiracy. They infiltrate the launch site and wreak havoc. CD and one of the conspirators, Sly Moorcock, compete for the affections of Rachel, who eventually joins the conspiracy as Sly's intended partner. EcoAction try to warn the rest of the world about the plan, but they are not taken seriously. The cabal kill many of those who have investigated or uncovered the conspiracy. Rachel turns on Sly at the last minute so she can sabotage the launch, but he overpowers and tries to abduct her. She escapes and rejoins the surviving members of EcoAction. The Stark Conspiracy blast off, but find that their existence is frustrating and lonely. Sly Moorcock eventually commits suicide. The narrative ends with an admonishment for the world's consumers over their inaction on environmental issues in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Characters The novel features a large number of characters, both human and animal. The main protagonists are an ensemble of humans who form the EcoAction team. The main antagonists are a small group who form the Stark Conspiracy. There are also numerous gag characters, who are introduced for the purposes of narrating a humorous tale, and then quickly discarded. These characters are often animals. For example, Dave the dolphin is born, and Iggy the iguana eats a fly, and all die very shortly afterwards. Most of the human characters are derided by the narrative for comedic effect and as a vehicle for social commentary. The animal characters are usually anthropomorphised. The author gives them human names and describes their thoughts and point of view as though the animal were a sentient human. Animals are often portrayed as being more intelligent than humans. Their simple lifestyles are compared with those of humans, particularly to the extent which human consumption impacts the environment. Late in the story, a camel named Walter Culboon (named by a human character after two of the EcoAction characters who die) becomes integral to the infiltration of the Stark base. =Human characters= EcoAction: * Colin \\"CD\\" Dobson, a British-born loser living in Australia. He frequently acts out of a desire to impress women, to obtain sex. * Rachel Kelly, CD's love interest, who eventually partners with Sly Moorcock. * Zimmerman, a former Army commando who lost his genitals during a firefight in the Vietnam War. * Walter, an environmentalist and hippie who is close friends with Zimmerman. * Johnny and Maud Culboon, Aborigines whose land becomes the site of the Stark Conspiracy. * Christine 'Chrissy' Kelly (apparently no relation to Rachel), an American journalist who investigates the financial dealings of the conspiracy. The Stark Conspiracy: * Silvester \\"Sly\\" Moorcock, a businessman who is indoctrinated into the Stark Conspiracy. * Tex Slampacker, an American fast food magnate. * Ocker Tyron, an Australian businessman whose rivalry with Moorcock causes tension. * Mr Nagasyu, a Japanese technology businessman. * Professor Durf, an ecological scientist who heads the Domesday Group (the research arm of the Conspiracy). * Aristos Tyron, Ocker's hanger-on brother. * Gordon Gordon, a white power skinhead who intimidates the Indigenous people into giving up their land. Connections with other works Elton wrote a screenplay based on this novel, which was subsequently made as Stark, a television miniseries. It was a joint production by the BBC and the ABC (the British and Australian national broadcasters). Ben Elton played the lead role, with Colin Friels as Sly and Jacqueline McKenzie as Rachel. There were some differences between the novel and the miniseries; some characters were renamed, and the ending was different. Elton's subsequent two novels, Gridlock and This Other Eden, also deal with environmental themes and are set in a dystopian future. Alternative 3, a 1977 British television hoax masquerading as a documentary, shared some themes with Stark.

The firm's partners were Samuel Beck Parkman Trowbridge and Goodhue Livingston. Founded in 1894 as Trowbridge, Livingston & Colt, the firm became known for its commercial, public, and institutional buildings, many in a Beaux Arts or neoclassical style, including the B. Altman and Company Building (1905), J. P. Morgan Building (1913), and the Oregon State Capitol (1938). Often commissioned by well-heeled clients, much of the firm's work was built in the Upper East Side and Financial District neighborhoods of New York. Partner biographies Trowbridge (1862‚Äì1925), was the fourth of eight children born to William Petit Trowbridge and Lucy Parkman Trowbridge. His father was a military engineer who oversaw construction of Fort Totten Battery, and repairs to Fort Schuyler during the American Civil War. After the War, he became professor of mechanical engineering at Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1871, then at the Columbia School of Mines in 1877. The younger Trowbridge studied at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. On graduating in 1883, he attended Columbia University, and later studied abroad at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens and at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. On his return to New York, he entered the office of George B. Post. Trowbridge worked in the firm for over 30 years, until his death in 1925. Goodhue Livingston (1867‚Äì1951), from a distinguished family of colonial New York, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Columbia during the same period Trowbridge was at the school. Firm activity Bankers Trust Company Building, NYC In 1894, Trowbridge, Livingston and Stockton B. Colt formed a partnership that lasted until 1897 when Colt left, and the firm became Trowbridge & Livingston. Its major commissions were received between 1901 and 1938, most in a Beaux Arts or neoclassical style. The majority of the firm's work was in New York City, where the firm designed several notable public and commercial buildings. Among the most famous are the neo-Baroque St. Regis Hotel (1904) and the B. Altman and Company Building (1906), both on Fifth Avenue; the 37-story Bankers Trust Company Building (1912) at 14 Wall Street; and the J. P.

History The Congressional resolution of June 14, 1775, authorized ten companies of expert riflemen to be raised for one-year enlistments as Continental troops. Maryland and Virginia were to raise two companies each, and Pennsylvania six. Pennsylvania frontiersman, however were so eager to participate that on June 22 Pennsylvania's quota of two was increased to eight, organized as a regiment known as the \\"Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment.\\" A ninth company was added to the regiment on July 11. All thirteen companies were sent to Washington's army at Boston for use as light infantry and later as special reserve forces. Seven companies of the regiment (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 9th) were made up of Germans, Welsh, the rare Manx, Free Quakers, even English but mostly Scots-Irish from Lancaster; the 6th and 7th companies were mostly German, from Berks and Northampton counties. Their standard weapon was the long rifle, which had greater range and accuracy than the muskets used by most of the British Army and Continental Army, but less weight of shot, slower rate of fire, and were without bayonets, making the regiment unsuitable for line-of-battle. Doctor James Thacher, a young doctor from Barnstable who observed the regiment during many of its battles, provided this description of the riflemen: > They are remarkably stout and hardy men; many of them exceeding six feet in > height. They are dressed in white frocks or rifle shirts and round hats. > There men are remarkable for the accuracy of their aim; striking a mark with > great certainty at two hundred yards distance. At a review, a company of > them, while in a quick advance, fired their balls into objects of seven > inches diameter at the distance of 250 yards . . . their shot have > frequently proved fatal to British officers and soldiers who expose > themselves to view at more than double the distance of common musket shot. > (Source: James Thacher, \\"Military Journal during the American Revolutionary > War from 1775 to 1783\\".) As described under colours, the regiment in 1776 wore green hunting shirts with black caps trimmed white adorned with feather while the officers wore green coats with red facings and similar caps.http://www.acwgc.org/CCC_Am_Army/Images/Uniforms%20of%20American%20Revolution/1st_Cont_Rifle_Regt1776.jpg By the Battle of Boston and by regulation at Valley Forge, blue coats with red facings were issued to the regiment, while most of the regiment's Riflemen continued to wear hunting shirts until wars end. The regiment saw action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Second Battle of Trenton, and Battle of Princeton. At the Battle of Brandywine the regiment was led by Colonel James Chambers and assigned to Colonel Thomas Hartley's 1st Pennsylvania Brigade. Under the direction of acting division commander Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment fought near Chadds Ford where it held the \\"post of honor\\", the far right flank of the division.McGuire (2006), 249 At the Battle of Germantown the regiment was brigaded with the 2nd, 7th, and 10th Pennsylvania Regiments. The unit again fought on the extreme right flank of the division just east of Germantown Road. Afterward, the regiment's Major Henry Miller boasted to his family about how the division routed the British troops opposed to them and overran their camp.McGuire (2007), 71 The 1st was in action at the Battle of Matson's Ford on December 11, 1777.McGuire (2007), 259-260 The unit also fought at the Battle of Monmouth in 1778 and the Battle of Springfield in 1780. Two companies, those of Captain William Hendricks and Captain Matthew Smith, accompanied Arnold's expedition to Quebec and were captured in the Battle of Quebec. The regiment was furloughed June 11, 1783, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and disbanded on November 15, 1783. Company C of the 337th Engineer Battalion claims lineage from Captain Michael Doudeis Company of York, Pennsylvania, of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment.

(1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. yellow toadflax, or butter-and-eggs) is a species of toadflax (Linaria), native from Europe to Siberia and Central Asia. It has also been introduced and is now common in North America. Growth It is a perennial plant with short spreading roots, erect to decumbent stems high, with fine, threadlike, glaucous blue-green leaves long and broad. The flowers are similar to those of the snapdragon, long, pale yellow except for the lower tip which is orange, borne in dense terminal racemes from mid summer to mid autumn. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. The fruit is a globose capsule long and broad, containing numerous small seeds. Ecology Linaria vulgaris in a meadow Pollination by garden bumblebee The plant is widespread on ruderal spots, along roads, in dunes, and on disturbed and cultivated land. Because the flower is largely closed by its underlip, pollination requires strong insects such as bees and bumblebees (Bombus species). The plant is food plant for a large number of insects such as the sweet gale moth (Acronicta euphorbiae), mouse moth (Amphipyra tragopoginis), silver Y (Autographa gamma), Calophasia lunula, gorgone checkerspot (Charidryas gorgone carlota), toadflax pug (Eupithecia linariata), satyr pug (Eupithecia satyrata), Falseuncaria ruficiliana, bog fritillary (Boloria eunomia), Pyrrhia umbra, brown rustic (Rusina ferruginea), and Stenoptilia bipunctidactyla. It may be mildly toxic to livestock. Fossil record Seeds of the common toadflax, were identified from the Hoxnian interglacial strata at Clacton. Records have also come from the Weichselian glaciation strata in Essex, Huntingdonshire, Surrey and North Wales. This evidence makes the native status of the plant in Britain quite evident despite the very strong association that it has today with waste places and man-made habitats. Cultivation and uses While most commonly found as a wildflower, toadflax is sometimes cultivated for cut flowers, which are long-lasting in the vase. Like snapdragons (Antirrhinum), they are often grown in children's gardens for the \\"snapping\\" flowers which can be made to \\"talk\\" by squeezing them at the base of the corolla. The plant requires ample drainage, but is otherwise adaptable to a variety of conditions. It has escaped from cultivation in North America where it is common on roadsides and in poor soils, where it has now naturalized in many U.S. states and Canadian provinces. Despite its reputation as a weed, like the dandelion, this plant has also been used in folk medicine for a variety of ailments. A tea made from the leaves was taken as a laxative and strong diuretic as well as for jaundice, dropsy, and enteritis with drowsiness. For skin diseases and piles, either a leaf tea or an ointment made from the flowers was used. In addition, a tea made in milk instead of water has been used as an insecticide. It is confirmed to have diuretic and fever-reducing properties. Other names Linaria acutiloba Fisch. ex Rchb. is a synonym. Because this plant grows as a weed, it has acquired a large number of local colloquial names, including brideweed, bridewort, butter and eggs (but see Lotus corniculatus), butter haycocks, bread and butter, bunny haycocks, bunny mouths, calf's snout, Continental weed, dead men's bones, devil's flax, devil's flower, doggies, dragon bushes, eggs and bacon (but see Lotus corniculatus), eggs and butter, false flax, flaxweed, fluellen (but see Kickxia), gallweed, gallwort, impudent lawyer, Jacob's ladder (but see Polemonium), lion's mouth, monkey flower (but see Mimulus), North American ramsted, rabbit flower, rancid, ransted, snapdragon (but see Antirrhinum), wild flax, wild snapdragon, wild tobacco (but see Nicotiana), yellow rod, yellow toadflax.

The regiment and its predecessor the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion saw action during the Battles of Brooklyn, Valcour Island, Trenton, the Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Springfield. The regiment was furloughed on June 11, 1783, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and disbanded on November 15, 1783. In January 1776, the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion took part in Benedict Arnold's failed attempt to capture Quebec. With little to no winter clothing and half their muskets not in workable condition, the men struggled into Canada, their strength reduced by sickness. By March 30, four of the companies had arrived at the American lines near Quebec, but before the remainder could come up the attack was abandoned and the battalion started the retreat back to New York. The Regiment was encamped with the American Army at Fort Ticonderoga. In October it participated in Anthony Wayne's defeat of the British at Valcour Island. It remained at Ticonderoga until November 13 to await the arrival of replacement troops. By December 8 a remnant of the First Battalion was at New Germantown, NJ, but most of the men had been mustered out of service. During this time, Congress realized a more substantial national army with enlistments longer than 12 months would be needed to fight the war successfully. Pennsylvania was assigned to provide 12 of these \\"Continental\\" regiments and decided to use the battalions created in 1775 as the foundation for the state's quota. Thus, the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles, being the first unit formed by the state, became the First Pennsylvania Regiment, while the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion became the nucleus of the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment. Despite hardship, about 340 of the nearly 500 men who had been with the 1st Battalion at Ticonderoga did join the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment to join Washington's army at Trenton and fight in the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777, in a brigade of Pennsylvanians commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas Mifflin. The regiment spent the winter months at Morristown, NJ, where it built up strength and was placed in Gen. Anthony Wayne's Division. Col. Henry Bicker was appointed to lead the regiment but did not actually join until the following October. In the meantime, the regiment was commanded by the senior officer present for duty, Major William Williams. Williams led the unit in patrol actions in New Jersey during the spring and summer, including an engagement at Bound Brook on April 11 or 12 and a skirmish at Amboy on April 25 in which one officer was killed. At the Battle of Brandywine, the regiment was part of the force guarding Chadds Ford until the British stormed across the creek and compelled Wayne's Division to withdraw. It sustained casualties at Paoli on Sept. 21, including one officer killed, and at the Battle of Germantown it was the left flank of the American troops attacking the British center that was mistakenly fired on by other American troops. By the end of October, the unit had suffered substantially from all the fighting, including the loss of Major Williams who was captured at Germantown. Capt. Joseph Howell became acting regimental commander and the Second Pennsylvania Regiment numbered only 13 other officers and 74 enlisted men present for duty at the end of the month. The few present were able to man a section of the army's first line of defense at Whitemarsh in early December, before moving with the rest of Washington's forces into the legendary winter encampment at Valley Forge. Here the regiment shared the sufferings of the Continental Line, trained in Von Steuben's new manual of arms and brought itself up to strength. With France entering the conflict on the side of the new United States in May, the British abandoned Philadelphia and moved across New Jersey to the more easily defended stronghold of New York City. On June 19, 1778, the Continental Army left Valley Forge in pursuit and engaged the British in the Battle of Monmouth on an extremely hot June 28. Here the Second Pennsylvania served in a provisional brigade commanded by Lt. Col. Aaron Burr and made a charge from the American left flank into a British force trying to assault the American center. It halted the British attack but was itself compelled to retire under subsequent artillery fire. The regiment lost two men wounded in this action. On July 1, 1778, the regiment absorbed the remainder of the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment, most of its men's enlistments having expired. The colonel of the 13th, 23-year-old Walter Stewart, became the Second's new commander. The young officer, nicknamed \\"The Irish Beauty\\" by the ladies of Philadelphia, was a close friend of Anthony Wayne's and well acquainted with Washington as well. He was an able leader with a reputation of taking care of the welfare of his men. Diarist Joseph Plumb Martin described him as \\"an excellent officer, much beloved and respected by the troops of the Line he belonged to.\\" Under Stewart, the regiment operated along the New York-New Jersey border and moved to Middlebrook, NJ, in early December for the winter of 1778-79. There is no particular record that the unit was involved in any fighting that summer, but in October 1779, it had 452 officers and men with Wayne at West Point. From there it moved to Morristown, NJ, for the encampment in Jockey Hollow where it endured the most brutal winter of the 18th Century. When spring came, the regiment was again actively engaged in patrols and skirmishes with British forays from New York. On May 18 the unit lost a junior officer killed in a fight at Paramus. On June 7 it fought at Connecticut Farms and on June 21 was at \\"the blockhouse\\" at Bergen Hts., where it joined the First Pennsylvania Regiment in a gallant but futile headlong charge on a sturdy Loyalist fortification despite the attempts of the officers to restrain the men. Two lieutenants were mortally wounded here and a number of men killed. On Sept. 21 the regiment was in Hartford, CT, with Wayne to greet French General Rochambeau. On Sept. 25 it rushed from Tappan, NY, to West Point to reinforce the garrison there after Benedict Arnold's treachery was discovered. In December the 2nd returned to Morristown for another winter. There, on Jan. 1, 1781, the mutiny of the Pennsylvania troops took place. The men of the regiment refused at first to join the mutineers, but were finally forced to when the other troops threatened them at bayonet point and with artillery. The resulting restructuring of the Pennsylvania Line perpetuated a 2nd Regiment among the state's six reorganized units, with Walter Stewart still in command. However, the men who remained in service were all redistributed among all these units and this establishment was mostly on paper. Essentially, the old 2nd Pennsylvania ceased to exist before the final campaign in Virginia and South Carolina, although former members of the regiment were battle casualties at Green Springs on July 6 and Yorktown in October.

Max Steel ran for three seasons, totaling thirty-five episodes. From 2004 to 2012, direct-to-DVD movies kept the presence of the main character alive. However, the first movie (titled, Max Steel: Endangered Species) was the only movie to keep the continuity of the series. After Endangered Species, the continuity was altered. Endangered Species was the only movie to be made available in America, while later releases were in Latin America. The voice-acting cast for the series included Chi McBride and Christian Campbell, as well as well-known sports stars, such as Tony Hawk. After the bankruptcy of Netter Digital and Foundation Imaging, Mainframe Entertainment took over the productions of the third season and the movies. The last episode, \\"Truth Be Told\\", aired January 15, 2002. Max Steel was the first computer-generated series to air on Kids' WB. A reboot series aired on Disney XD in 2013. However, characters and storylines were greatly altered. Backstory The protagonist, Josh McGrath (Campbell), is a 19-year- old fictional extreme sports teen star, whose parents died some time ago. He was later adopted by his father's best friend and partner, Jefferson Smith (McBride), who works in an extreme sports equipment manufacturing company which is in reality a fa√ßade for a secret counter-intelligence agency known as N-Tek. While Josh was visiting his stepfather at work, Psycho (Szarabajka) broke into the facility. The young McGrath faced him and battled against this super-powered cyborg, but in the middle of the fight, he was severely injured and exposed to a swarm of microscopic nanomachines, known to the company as \\"Nano-Tech Max.\\" The nanomachines entered Josh's body and, as they ran out of energy, started dying, causing Josh to die too. In order to save Josh's life, his foster father, Jefferson Smith, agreed to submit Josh to a high proportion of the transphasic energy (nicknamed \\"t-juice\\"), which the machines need to survive. This saved his life and also gave him superpowers. As a result, Josh took on the identity of Max Steel and fights against super-powered villains, mainly Mr. Dread (Jarvis), Psycho's evil boss, and the members of DREAD, his spy organization. Later, in the movies, they fight off mutants, robots, mad scientists and monsters. Episodes Max Steel debuted on Kids' WB with the episode \\"Strangers\\" on February 26, 2000, and ended with episode \\"Truth Be Told\\" on January 15, 2002. The show ran for three seasons, totaling 35 episodes. The series can be found on DVD: Volume one contains episodes 1‚Äì6, contains episodes 7‚Äì13, and the final one is a box-set with all of season one. Seasons 2 and 3 were never released. VHS ones were made available with various \\"Max Steel\\" action figures: \\"Strangers,\\" \\"Snow Blind,\\" \\"Sphinxes,\\" and \\"Old Friend, New Enemy\\" were sold. As of 2009, episodes of Max Steel can be found on Crackle's YouTube account, however, these are no longer accessible. Transmitted ONTV series Max Steel for a predetermined time. In 2014, Tiin transmitted the series. The series is available on Hulu in English and Spanish. Characters =N-Tek and civilians= * Josh McGrath alias Max Steel (voiced by Christian Campbell from 2000 - 2002, Matthew Kaminsky in two episodes in 2001) ‚Äì As Josh McGrath, he is a college student and an extreme sports star, working for his adoptive father, Jefferson Smith of N-Tek, which supplies such equipment. He later discovers that N-Tek is a front for a secret anti-terrorist organization. In the course of this discovery, he suffered an accident when he was doused with nanoprobes while battling Psycho. These probes gave him enhanced senses, ability to alter his appearance, turn invisible (dubbed, \\"Stealth mode!\\") and made him superhumanly-strong, agile, and fast (dubbed, \\"Going turbo!\\"), and to heal faster than a normal human being, but due to them integrating with his organic systems, he requires periodic doses of transphasic energy to survive or the probes will essentially starve to death and kill him. He uses this to take on the appearance of Max Steel, who looks very different from Josh McGrath, and join the fight against crime. His work in extreme sports and as a crime-buster often conflicts with college and his relationship with his girlfriend Laura Chen. As Josh, he has brown eyes and blonde hair. As Max, he has blue eyes and brown hair. * Molly McGrath ‚Äì Josh's mother died when he was just a toddler, in a shipwreck during a storm at sea while the family was on a pleasure trip. Molly makes a brief appearance without dialogue only once when the incident is mentioned in the episode \\"Sharks\\": Max is being haunted by her death, and, despite being only a toddler when she died, blames himself for her death. After this, she's never mentioned again. Besides being a lovely mother, there's no other information about her. * Jefferson Smith (voiced by Chi McBride from 2000 to 2002, Scott McNeil in Endangered Species) ‚Äì The CEO of N-Tek, both the sports and spy sides. He inherited this position from Marco Nathanson, the previous and first CEO of N-Tek. He is the adoptive father of Max after his father died. Being an international counter-terrorism agency, N-Tek answers to the UN and includes a number of other non-US citizens on its staff. He voices his displeasure when Max is put in harm's way, but ultimately lets him go, knowing that Max is stronger than any human, and will be able to defeat enemies more easily than others. His relationship with Max is strained, but the two ultimately make amends. * Dr. Roberto Martinez (voiced by Jacob Vargas from 2000 to 2002, Alessandro Juliani in Endangered Species) ‚Äì A technical genius in his late teen years. Best known as 'Berto (a diminutive of his name), he is the main expert on Nano-Tek Max, the microscopic machines which gave Max Steel his superhuman abilities. 'Berto is usually based at the HQ of the secret intelligence service N-Tek where he monitors Max's missions via a computer screen, but he also often takes a more active part in the missions himself. He has family in Colombia, although how many relatives is unknown. From the moment they met, he and Josh became very close: Josh would call Roberto \\"Bro\\", who would respond with the Spanish version, \\"Hermano\\". * Rachel Leeds (voiced by Shannon Kenny from 2000 to 2001) ‚Äì Max's first partner at N-Tek. Although her country of origin is not specified, her accent indicates that she may be a British national. Rachel has a rather bossy personality but is very attractive in her own way. Much of focused on her relationship with Max: from one of constant squabbling to increasing attraction on his part, which affected Josh's relationship with his girlfriend Laura Chen. At one stage Rachel did kiss Max as a way of calming him down when he was getting particularly agitated, but seemed to think that he ought to stick to Laura: one episode concludes with Rachel smiling and saying \\"Blessings on your union\\" in Chinese as Josh and Laura leave arm-in-arm. After the second series, Rachel was promoted and disappeared after three episodes. There is speculation that she has a brief, non-speaking appearance in season two, episode four, but it is also likely that it was just a reused model. She can normally handle herself in a fight even against multiple opponents bare handed, hence the reason why she was assigned to train and tutor Max as a new N-Tek Agent. * Kat Ryan (voiced by Debi Mae West from 2000 to 2002, Meghan Black in Endangered Species) ‚Äì After Rachel's promotion in season two, Kat, another of her prot√©g√©s, became Max's new partner. At first they didn't get along, but, after Jefferson Smith forced them to work together, they developed a little mutual respect. About the same age as Josh and Roberto, her relationship with the two boys is like that of a sister, much like how Josh and 'Berto see each other as brothers. Kat was never given a surname until season three, and it was revealed in the second-to-last episode that, when she was younger, she was part of a street gang and did \\"very bad stuff.\\" She did time in a juvenile detention center, and has since changed her ways. * Laura Chen and Pete Costas (voiced by Lauren Tom and Thomas F. Wilson) ‚Äì Two of Josh's college friends, Pete referring to themselves as \\"the Three Musketeers\\" given that they used to be very close, until Josh's life as Max Steel started to interfere. Laura Chen was Josh's girlfriend but she soon broke up with him due in part to his increasingly close relationship with Rachel Leeds. He also kept his activities as Max Steel a secret from her and this would affect dates and other commitments which made him somewhat unreliable. Pete, in the season two premiere, found out about Josh's dual identity after being captured by John Dread and agreed to keep it secret. He was not seen in season 3. * Jean Mairot (voiced by Keith Szarabajka) ‚Äì Smith's second-in-command at N-Tek in season one and head of operations, briefing agents on their missions and coordinating their progress. A soft-spoken man, he is cool and calculating and a good judge of character ‚Äî putting Max in charge of a major rescue operation even though the boy himself did not feel up to it. At the end of season one, Mairot turned out to be a spy working for villain John Dread, N-Tek mainly winning because Dread kept underestimating Max. His fate is unknown, though it is presumed that he was caught in the explosion of Dread's base. His treachery was a bitter blow to the N-Tek staff since he had been a popular figure. story editor Greg Weisman has stated that Mairot was actually on N-Tek's side and in the final episode of , was going undercover into Dread's organization on Jefferson Smith's orders. Weisman also stated that Mairot did survive the explosion of Dread's base. Weisman was not involved in , and thus this storyline was never revealed in an actual episode. Mairot spoke in a French accent. * Charles \\"Chuck\\" Marshak (voiced by Edward Asner) ‚Äì An N-Tek division chief who's in charge of Behemoth, the massive flying fortress used as a mobile base to support Max in the TV series. He's a senior, probably around 60 years old, who assists N-Tek with his expertise. He was a close friend of Big Jim and acts a bit fatherly with Max. Despite his age and butler-like appearance, he can move extremely fast, and is an experienced hand-to-hand combatant. He does not appear in season 2 or 3, with no explanation of where he went. * Jake Nez (voiced by Gregg Rainwater) ‚Äì N-Tek agent and astronaut, formerly from NASA. He was also once a love interest of Rachel's but was dumped by her when she started training Max. He does not come across as the jealous type, ably assisting Max and Rachel on missions. =DREAD= * John Dread (voiced by Martin Jarvis) ‚Äì The leader of the DREAD organization, and the main antagonist of the first and second seasons (even after his supposed death). He's rarely seen outside of offices and rooms in dark secluded buildings, and only made two known appearances where he was the main or part of a main threat. He's presumably killed in the finale (S1E13 ‚Äì \\"Shattered\\") when his airship crashes, but it's revealed in the premiere (S2E1 ‚Äì \\"The Return\\") that he survived. He takes Pete Costas hostage and forces Max to steal valuable N-Tek research. He's later arrested and held in a maximum security prison. During the finale (S2E13 ‚Äì \\"Breakout\\"), Psycho and Bio-Con break him out while he is being transferred to another prison. It is believed he was killed off later in the same episode, but no body was found. There is fandom speculation that John Dread and Marco Nathanson (the N-Tek founder) are the same person, although this has been debunked by the first season story editor Greg Weisman. * Psycho (voiced by Keith Szarabajka, Brian Drummond in Endangered Species) ‚Äì His real name is unknown, although his nickname/DREAD code-name is speculated to come from the fact that he appears to be a psychopath. He's often called \\"Smiley\\", mainly by Max but occasionally by other members of N-Tek. He ignores it when Max refers to him as smiley, but usually has very violent reactions when other members of DREAD address him with that nickname. He has a metallic face which looks like the human skull, with an unusually large smiling jaw (hence the reason of his nickname). In the first season, Psycho covers up his metallic face with a mask, which gives him the appearance of a normal tough white guy. His main weapon is his right bionic arm, which can change into a claw or a laser gun, presumably by nerve signals. In Endangered Species, Psycho also has a Psycho-droid, which looks almost exactly like him, except the droid is a silver or copper color. He features the same bionic arm as Psycho and has a self-destruct system, which Psycho ultimately uses to kill Bio-Con. * L'Etranger (voiced by John de Lancie) ‚Äì \\"The Stranger,\\" as his name translates from French into English. He wears a mask over his face, which appears to resemble a metal skull (similar to that-of Psycho), with little facial details, and was the first villain to appear in the TV show. At the end of said episode, Dread mentions that he is not a full-time member of his organization. By the time of his second appearance, he is said to no longer work for Dread. He is a mercenary terrorist with strength that rivals Max‚Äôs in turbo-mode and armed with electrical charged gloves which can produce an explosive spark. Being an electrical weapon, one hit is more than enough to stun his enemies for a large period of time. It appears that he drowned in the episode \\"Fun in the Sun\\" (S2E2). * Dragonelle (voiced by Mia Korf) ‚Äì She is the first major female villain shown. The origin of her code-name is unclear, although there is speculation that she comes from China (as that is where the episode which she appeared in for the first time took place). As dragons are a key part of Chinese mythology, it is believed that she took this name for good luck. She's dressed in golden battle armor, and has the ability to perfectly mimic the actions and appearance of any person she has seen. She's not much of a fighter, as she always runs away from any physical confrontation, since she's more an undercover agent than an active fighter. Nevertheless, she fights off both Max and 'Berto in the episode \\"Shooting Stars\\" (S2E8). Dragonelle is genuinely loyal to Dread, believing him to be ‚Äúa genius‚Äù and is penitent when she fails him. * Vitriol ‚Äì According to Max, Vitriol is \\"not the sharpest tool in the shed,\\" which explains why he often teams along with Psycho. While they are supposed to be equal members of DREAD, Vitriol usually follows Psycho's orders. His arms are vibrant, translucent green with metallic 'bones' visible, and can shoot green energy beams, which can be very destructive. At the end of season one, he realizes he's an expendable pawn, and decides to cooperate with N-Tek in an effort to obtain a reduced sentence. However, in , he would return to old habits, and go against N-Tek several times. In , he is seen several times as the main enemy. =Other villains= * Woody Barkowski and Annabelle Barkowski/Electrix ‚Äì Two siblings who are intent on bringing down N-Tek: Woody because he believes that they gave him a faulty mountain bike to cause him to break his leg and thus retire from the extreme sports world. Woody considers himself to be Max Steel's nemesis, but Max mentions that he \\"barely qualifies as comic relief.\\" Annabelle collaborates with her brother in the first season and seeks revenge for her brother in the second season. In season two, Annabelle suffers an accident in her laboratory and her body is never found. It is later revealed that Annabelle's body using electrical currents and sources as an energy supply, much like how the nanoprobes in Max's body uses transphasic energy. She adopts the name as Electrix and has several robots to act as her reinforcements. * Bio-Con (voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois, Scott McNeil in Endangered Species) ‚Äì His full name is Bio-Constrictor and short for \\"Biologically Altered Constricting Serpent\\", having been given this name by 'Berto. Dr. David Klimo was involved in an accident and is thought to have been injected with electrified snake venom, and thus mutated into a half- human, half reptile with the abilities to turn into a snake, poison people with highly-toxic venom or use his venom to transform other people into copies of his mutated self. Bio-Con looks more like a leather mummy than a snake, mostly because his body is composed of several serpents twisted around what seems to be his base skeleton. Before his accident, he was N-Tek an employee fired for erratic behavior, mainly due to the use of turning poisonous animals, such as scorpions and snakes, into biological weapons, which appears to form a basis of the plotline of the Endangered Species movie. Towards the end of Endangered Species, Psycho betrays him, and kills him with a self- destructing android. He initially met Josh when he was younger, and they used to play baseball together. * Lance Breamer ‚Äì He considers himself the \\"King of the sky.\\" Angered by those who feel his ideas are too expensive or too impractical, Lance creates a massive airplane called, \\"The Javelin.\\" Lance uses this to steal aircraft out of the sky, using fog exhibitors to conceal the plane, and knockout gas to wipe out a part of the pilot's short-term memory. After N-Tek use their plane, the Behemoth, as bait, Lance manages to abduct the plane with 'Berto inside. He takes a liking to 'Berto, and attempts to have 'Berto join him. After 'Berto refuses to destroy a plane, Lance lashes out, firing the Javelin's lasers at innocent bystanders. Shortly thereafter, Max boards the Javelin. Lance fights Max, but is knocked out and presumably arrested. * Hernando Carreras ‚Äì The leader of the so-called pirates in Baja. He only appears in the episode \\"Swashbucklers\\".

As a result, after two years of absence, in partnership with Mattel, Sony Family Pictures Entertainment and Mainframe Entertainment (now Rainmaker Animation) continued with the animated adventures of Max Steel as a series of Direct to DVD movies and a collection of 1 minute video clips. Each movie or clip usually presents Max challenging one of his enemies, and was used initially as a way to keep the presence of Max on TV, but eventually became a way to promote a series of new toys. After their initial release on TV, the movies were included as bonus gifts in many Max Steel toys or rewards for other activities related to the toy series. Most of the TV ads were grouped under the name of Turbo Missions. Future series/Reboot In January 2012, it was reported Mattel and Freemantle Media were working on a new television series and reboot of the Max Steel television series, which will still retain the name, but feature different characters, villains, and an entirely new storyline. This time, the show follows a 16-year-old Tachyon- human hybrid named Maxwell \\"Max\\" McGrath and his alien \\"Ultralink\\" partner, Steel. Maxwell McGrath learns he has the power to generate \\"TURBO energy\\", which he struggles to contain until meeting Steel. Steel gives Maxwell the ability to harness his power while merging his own to create one unified super force. The action adventure series was launched on March 1, 2013 to audiences on Cartoon Network channels throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Argentina. On October 5, 2012, it was confirmed that the series will air on Disney XD in the United States. Max Steel premiered Monday, March 25, 2013.

Often considered idiosyncratic for a philosopher, Nietzsche felt his music played a role in understanding his philosophical thought. He particularly applied this idea to Hymn to Life. He also used the song's melody in Hymn to Friendship for piano, which he once conducted at Bayreuth for Wagner and his wife. This had, according to Cosima Wagner, led to the first sign of a break with his friend Richard, in 1874. In spite of Nietzsche's ideas about his music, it has largely been regarded as a biographical curiosity, irrelevant to his philosophical work. Origin Nietzsche stated, after communicating the main idea of Zarathustra along with an aspect of his gaya scienza, in Ecce Homo: \\"...that Hymn to Life...‚Äîa scarcely trivial symptom of my condition during that year when the Yes-saying pathos par excellence, which I call the tragic pathos, was alive in me to the highest degree. The time will come when it will be sung in my memory\\" (trans. Walter Kaufmann). The composition Hymn to Life was partly done by Nietzsche in August and September 1882, supported by the second stanza of the poem Lebensgebet by Lou Andreas-Salome. In 1884, Nietzsche wrote to Gast: \\"This time, 'music' will reach you. I want to have a song made that could also be performed in public in order to seduce people to my philosophy.\\" With this request, Gast reworked Lebensgebet into Friendship, and it was orchestrated by Pietro Gasti,Ecce Homo, trans. Walter Kaufmann who modestly denied any reference in publication to his alterations to what Nietzsche had done previously. (Some, including Benjamin Moritz, feel these changes are significant enough to consider Life not an work by Nietzsche, but by K√∂selitz.) In the summer of 1887, E. W. Fritzsch in Leipzig published the work under Nietzsche's name as the first edition, which is Friendship simply put to Andreas-Salome's Lied and with orchestral alterations, entitled Hymnus an das Leben. In October of the same year, Nietzsche wrote a letter to the German conductor Felix Mottl, saying about Life: \\"I wish that this piece of music may stand as a complement to the word of the philosopher which, in the manner of words, must remain by necessity unclear. The affect of my philosophy finds its expression in this hymn.\\" The following December, he wrote to Georg Brandes a letter in which he commented: \\"A choral and orchestral work of mine is just being published, a Hymn to Life. It is the one composition of mine that is meant to survive and to be sung one day 'in my memory'....\\" See also *List of works by Friedrich Nietzsche *Nietzsche Music Project References External links *Hymnus an das Leben performance *Nietzsche Music Project *John Bell Young's discography, displays of his work on Nietzsche's music are included. *Customer review by John Bell Young on Nietzsche's music with criticism of the reviewed CD, Lauretta Altman, etc. *\\"The Music and Thought of Friedrich Nietzsche\\"‚Äîa dissertation by Ben Moritz (PDF): \\"the original Hymnus an die Freundschaft is a generally well-written and delightful work, worthy of inclusion in the piano repertoire.\\" *Nietzsche's music in four volumes. *Nietzsche as Composer Category:Choral compositions Category:Compositions by Friedrich Nietzsche ","title":"Hymnus an das Leben"},{"id":"3639924","text":"Requena may refer to: Places =Peru= * Requena, Loreto, capital of Requena Province, Peru * Requena Province, Peru =Spain= * Requena, Valencia, a town in the Valencian Community * Requena de Campos, a municipality located in the province of Palencia, Castile and Le√≥n * Utiel- Requena, a wine-producing region in the Valencian Community People with the surname * Gladys Requena (born 1952), Venezuelan politician * Manuel Requena, president of the Los Angeles Common Council in the early 1850s * Yurema Requena (born 1983), Spanish swimmer who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics ","title":"Requena"},{"id":"3639927","text":"The 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Muster In The 2nd Iowa Infantry was organized at Keokuk, Iowa, and mustered into Federal service on May 28, 1861. At Keokuk, the field officers were chosen by a vote from the captains of each company within the regiment. Samuel R. Curtis was chosen as colonel, James M. Tuttle was chosen as lieutenant colonel, and Marcellus M. Crocker was made major. Among its officers, several reached the rank of general by the war's end. Samuel R. Curtis became a major general; James Tuttle and Marcellus M. Crocker became brigadier generals; Hiram Scofield, James Weaver, Norton Parker Chipman and Thomas J. McKenny, became a brevet brigadier generals. Hereafter referred to as O.R. The 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment fought throughout the course of the war. The soldiers of the 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment enlisted for three-year terms, with many soldiers fighting until the end of the war. Highlights Highlights of the service of this regiment include distinguished actions at the Battle of Fort Donelson and at the Battle of Shiloh, where about 80 members of the regiment were casualties, either dead or wounded. The regiment fought in the subsequent Battle of Corinth and later in the Atlanta Campaign, including at the Battle of Atlanta, continuing on to South Carolina and to Goldsboro, North Carolina, in the Carolinas Campaign. With the surrender of the Confederate States Army under Joseph E. Johnston, the 2nd Iowa traveled to Washington, D.C., for the Grand Review of the Armies of the Union on May 23‚Äì24, 1865.ancestry.com, referring to Historical Data Systems Inc. P.O. Box 196 Kingston, MA 02364, Copyright 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000. The regiment was mustered out on July 12, 1865, and discharged at Davenport, Iowa, on July 20, 1865. Total strength and casualties Strength of unit was 1433. The regiment suffered 12 officers and 108 enlisted men who were killed in action or who died of their wounds and 4 officers and 159 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 283 fatalities.The Civil War Archive website after Dyer, Frederick Henry.

WeaverIowa in the Civil War Project after Logan, Guy E., Roster and Record of Iowa Troops In the Rebellion, Vol. 1 Beginning of Service Shortly after the muster in, the 2nd Iowa Infantry began marching to St. Joseph, Missouri. At St. Joseph the regiment took military control of and guarded northern Missouri railroads.Iowa Adjutant General‚Äôs Office, 91‚Äì92 Although not as threatening as a major battle would be, a soldier on railroad duty still risked his life daily. For example, in mid-July, Company A skirmished with the Confederates near the Charriton railroad bridge. While guarding this bridge, a small group of soldiers discovered Confederate bridge burners. After engaging the rebels, who were estimated as numbered between 80 and 100 men, Company A managed to save the bridge, capture five horses, and kill 18 Confederate Soldiers. After St. Joseph, the 2nd Iowa embarked on the journey across Missouri to Bird's Point, Missouri, and the surrounding area for similar duties. The regiment arrived at Bird's Point on August 2, 1861, and performed more guarding duties similar to those in St. Joseph. Soon after, the regiment marched to Jackson and Pilot Knob, Missouri, and Fort Jefferson, Kentucky, for more guarding duty until reporting back to Bird's Point on September 24, 1861.Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry, 18 After arriving at Bird's Point for the second time, the 2nd Iowa remained there from the end of September to the end of October 1861. Colonel Curtis was promoted to brigadier general and Lt. Colonel Tuttle became the new leader of the regiment, receiving his promotion to colonel on September 6, 1861.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 51 While serving at Bird's Point and the surrounding area, the 2nd Iowa lived in poor conditions, which caused much illness. An estimated 400 of 1000 men were able to serve. Because of the poor state of health, the 2nd Iowa was ordered to the Benton Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, in order to recuperate and recruit in order to replace the men who had died from disease. The 2nd Iowa arrived in St. Louis on October 29, and by December 26 the regiment's sick list numbered about 200. As the overall health of the regiment continued to improve, the 2nd Iowa was ordered to guard McDowell College. After the owner of the college joined the Confederate army, the U.S. War Department seized the school and converted it into a military prison.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 1‚Äì2 When the 2nd Iowa began guarding the prison, there were approximately 1,300 prisoners held at the college. Thanks to some reeducation and the resulting oaths of allegiance, the number was reduced to approximately 1,100 prisoners at the time of the 2nd Iowa's departure. Colonel Tuttle led the re-education of the prisoners, teaching the rebels ‚ÄúUncle Samuel is not to be fooled with and that [the prisoners] have to submit or somebody will get hurt.‚ÄùFound in ‚ÄúDiary, Letters, Newspaper Clippings, etc. of Captain Charles C. Cloutman, 2nd Iowa Infantry, Company K,‚Äù Manuscript Collection, State Historical Society of Iowa: Des Moines, Iowa Shortly before the 2nd Iowa would be relieved of prison duty in early 1862, a few unknown members of the regiment broke into a museum at the college and stole some items of minimal importance. Because of this, General Henry Halleck ordered that the regiment, which was well-liked by the people of St. Louis and the prisoners, march through the streets on the way to the steamer T. H. McGill in disgrace without music or colors. On February 10, 1862, the 2nd Iowa Infantry embarked on their next assignment.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 4 At Fort Donelson On February 14, 1862, the Iowans arrived at Fort Donelson. There, the 2nd Iowa would become legendary in one of the most crucial battles of the war. Strategically, the capture of Fort Donelson meant navigability for steamers along the Cumberland River, a direct path to the rear of Confederate forces in Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as a hold on valuable supply and communications lines. After the defeat at Fort Donelson, confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston wrote, ‚ÄúThe blow was disastrous and almost without remedy.‚ÄùWallace, The Capture of Fort Donelson, 1:398-400. Fort Donelson was defended with twenty-eight regiments of infantry, two independent battalions, one regiment of cavalry, artillerymen for six light batteries, and seventeen heavy guns. This added up to approximately 18,000 defenders. The Federal army, under the leadership of General Ulysses S. Grant, managed to create an attacking force that numbered approximately 20,000 soldiers.Wallace, The Capture of Fort Donelson, 402-6. Along the line fierce fighting without much success for Federal troops was still occurring upon the arrival of the 2nd Iowa. During the fighting the previous day, a brigade advanced on the extreme left, where the 2nd Iowa was eventually placed, and suffered severe losses before retreating back to the skirmish line.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 53-4. After their arrival on February 14, 1862, the 2nd Iowa was placed at the extreme left of Grant's force as a part of General Charles Smith's division, and Colonel Tuttle sent companies A and B ahead as skirmishers. The rest of the regiment spent a night on the line without tents or blankets to protect them from the brutal winter weather.O.R. Ser. 1, Vol. VII, 229-230; Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 5 On February 15, the Confederate forces counterattacked the right wing of Grant's forces and the Federal troops were pushed back. When told of this, General Grant said, ‚ÄúGentlemen, the position on the right must be re-taken‚Äù and rode off to give instructions to General Smith.Wallace, The Capture of Fort Donelson, 422. Those instructions were to attack with the brigade on the left, which were the 25th Indiana along with the 2nd, 7th, and 14th Iowa. Colonel Tuttle and the 2nd Iowa led the gallant charge.Wallace, The Capture of Fort Donelson, 422-7. National colors carried by the 2nd Iowa Infantry including Voltaire P. Twombly throughout the Civil War Voltaire Twombly John A. Duckworth recorded the words of Colonel Tuttle just before the charge. Tuttle told his men, ‚ÄúNow, my bully boys, give them cold steel. Do not fire a gun until you have got on the inside, then give them hell! Forward my boys! March!‚ÄùTwombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 15. At 2:00 p.m. Colonel Tuttle led the advance toward the enemy stronghold. As ordered, the 2nd Iowa marched in silence, without firing a shot. The regiment marched in line over the open meadow, through a gully, over a rail fence, and up a hill cluttered with broken trees when suddenly the enemy came into sight and a steady rain of lead poured into the ranks of the brave men. The 2nd Iowa answered with a deafening roar and continued to advance toward the Confederates despite their losses. The march was challenging and costly as volley after volley leveled the men of the 2nd Iowa Infantry. Continuing to absorb the damage from the enemy, the 2nd Iowa marched across the difficult terrain. Colonel Tuttle and Lieutenant Colonel Baker were both injured in the charge, yet they remained on the field throughout the charge. Company captains Jonathon Slaymaker and Charles Cloutman were killed in the charge. When Captain Slaymaker fell and his men tried to help him, he yelled, ‚ÄúGo on! Go on! Don‚Äôt stop for me!‚Äù At least five members of the color guard were wounded or killed before Corporal Voltaire Twombly would take the flag and be hit in the chest by a spent ball. However, he would rise again and charge with the colors until the day was done. Twombly would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Acts of bravery like those mentioned were normal for the men of the 2nd Iowa during the charge. Despite running for 200 yards under enemy fire, the 2nd Iowa would successfully charge and cross into the enemies works without firing a single round from their muskets.William C.

Once inside the enemy breastworks, the men of the 2nd Iowa opened fire on the Confederate soldiers, most of whom fell back to the next trench. Those who refused to retreat were put down by the men's bayonet. The men of the 2nd Iowa continued their attack on the Confederate forces and followed them into the next line of trenches before the Confederates could regroup and counterattack. At this point in the battle, the rest of the brigade, which formed the right wing of attack, began occupying the first trench and firing upon the second entrenchment. Friendly fire from the 52nd Indiana Infantry caused more casualties for the 2nd Iowa. In the confusion, the 2nd Iowa fell back into the first entrenchment and regrouped with their comrades behind them. General Smith then ordered the regiment to take cover behind the walls of the first trench while the 25th Indiana unsuccessfully tried to take the second trench by bayonet. After the failed charge, the Federal forces regrouped. The men endured another cold night without any protection from the elements, and prepared for battle in the morning.Holden, Letter to his Father dated February 21, 1862; Weaver, Letter to Wife dated February 19; O.R. Ser. 1, Vol. VII, 229-30; Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 6; To the surprise of the Federal Forces, the Confederates did not continue the fight in the morning but instead agreed to Grant's terms for unconditional surrender. On account of their bravery, the 2nd Iowa received the honor of leading the march into the fort. The regiment was the first to place their glorious flag, ridden with bullet holes and stained with blood, inside the fort. General Halleck, who just ten days ago ordered the regiment to march in shame, spoke of the bravery of the men of the 2nd Iowa. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Second Iowa Infantry proved themselves to be the bravest of brave. They had the honor of leading the column which entered Fort Donelson.‚ÄùO.R. Ser. 1, Vol. VII, 635. The price for glory came at a cost; the 2nd Iowa had 32 killed and 164 wounded during the battle.American Civil War Research Database; Lurton Ingersoll reports different numbers. He reports 41 killed and 157 wounded. See Ingersoll, Iowa and the Rebellion, 45; William Fox also lists different numbers, as he reports 33 killed and 164 wounded. See William F. Fox, Regimental Losses in the American Civil War, 403. Fort Donelson was now in possession of the Federal Government. After the capture of Fort Donelson, the Second Iowa remained at the fort. The men quickly plundered the fort, taking everything from weapons to blankets. Iowa governor Samuel Kirkwood visited the heroes, and the flag from the regiment was taken back to Iowa and hung in the place of honor over the house speaker's desk. Colonel Tuttle was placed in command of a brigade, which included the 2nd Iowa. This made Lieutenant Colonel Baker acting commander of the regiment. The 2nd Iowa would remain at Fort Donelson until March 6, 1862, when the regiment would be called to Pittsburg Landing to fight in the Battle of Shiloh.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 7; Ingersoll, Iowa and the Rebellion, 45; Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 7. The Battle of Shiloh The Confederate forces attacked Shiloh with a source of approximately 43,000 men under the command of Generals Albert Johnston and Gustave Beauregard.Reed, The Battle of Shiloh, 111. The Confederate forces under Beauregard were stationed in Corinth, and knowing the location of Grant's forces near Pittsburg Landing, thought it best to attack. Beauregard hoped to profit by capturing the Federal supplies, thus enabling the defense of Corinth against the approaching Federal General Don Carlos Buell and his forces. A victory at Shiloh was essential for Confederate troops to adequately defend Corinth.O.R. Series 1, Vol. X, pt. 1, 385. On March 19, 1862, the 2nd Iowa arrived at Pittsburg Landing. There the 2nd Iowa experienced pleasant weather and light drill duty until Sunday, April 6, when General Grant ordered the brigade to the front. Colonel Tuttle's brigade (1st Brigade) would be placed on the left of General William H. L. Wallace's division. The 1st Brigade took position on an old road, which extended from the Corinth road to south of East Corinth road. The 2nd Iowa Infantry repelled several enemy attacks on that day, resulting in great losses for the Confederate army. The fighting was so severe in this area that the place became known as ‚ÄúThe Hornets‚Äô Nest.‚Äù The brigade stood strong in this position for six hours until the Confederate army assembled artillery and blasted the location.O.R. Series 1, Vol. X, pt. 1, 149; Reed, The Battle of Shiloh, 48-9; Weaver, Letter to Wife dated April 9, 1862. During this fighting General Wallace was killed in action, and Colonel Tuttle, having been notified by Captain Noah W. Mills that the flank to the right was exposed although in the immediate vicinity the situation appeared normal, ordered the 2nd Iowa and the 7th Iowa infantries to retreat, narrowly avoiding capture. Had Captain Mills hesitated, the 2nd and 7th Iowa infantries would most likely have been captured with the rest of the division. The 2nd Iowa made it to the safety of the Federal gunboats at Pittsburg Landing, while General Don Carlos Buell's army provided reinforcements and re-established a line of defense before nightfall. The following morning the battle resumed, the 2nd Iowa being used as reserves until 1:00 p.m., when Brigadier General William Nelson ordered a charge against the Confederates who were holding a camp of an Ohio regiment. The 2nd Iowa successfully drove the enemy from the position. By 4:00 p.m. that day, the Federal forces had regained all they had lost on the previous day. The enemy, being weak from two days of battle without reinforcements, began to retreat towards Corinth, Mississippi.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 9-10; Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 19. Colonel Tuttle was officially promoted to brigadier-general because of his performance on the battlefield at Shiloh. Lieutenant Colonel Baker was then promoted to colonel and continued to lead the 2nd Iowa Infantry. Noah W. Mills was promoted from captain of Company D to lieutenant colonel. James B. Weaver was third in command as major from Company G.Ingersoll, Iowa and the Rebellion, 47. During the fighting at Shiloh, the 2nd Iowa again proved themselves as brave and vital to the Federal forces, and seven of the men sacrificed their lives and an additional thirty seven were wounded.American Civil War Research Database; David Reed lists the number of killed as 8, and the number wounded as 60; See Reed, The Battle of Shiloh, 91; William Fox also lists the number of killed as 8, and the number of wounded as 60; See Fox, Regimental Losses, 403. Iuka-Corinth Campaign The 2nd Iowa Infantry would remain at Pittsburg Landing until April 28, 1862. From there, the 2nd Iowa assisted in the advance on Corinth by General Halleck. The men constantly expected battle with Confederate General Beauregard and his army as the Federal forces under Halleck slowly made their way to Corinth, but Beauregard never confronted the Federal forces. After General Halleck created a line directly in front of Corinth, Beauregard and his army evacuated the city. The 2nd Iowa participated in the advance on Corinth for thirty days. On May 30, 1862, General Halleck's army marched into the evacuated Corinth uncontested. The 2nd Iowa participated in the unsuccessful chase after General Beauregard before reporting back to Camp Montgomery, located near Corinth, on June 15.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 11; Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 18. The 2nd Iowa remained near Corinth for the remainder of the summer; remaining in General Grant's Army of the Tennessee. During the summer, the 2nd Iowa was assigned chiefly to camp and picket-duty. The majority of the Confederate forces were near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the city of Corinth was in no immediate danger. The situation would not change until early September when Confederate General Sterling Price advanced his troops to the city of Iuka, just twenty miles east from Corinth.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 60. Federal Generals William Rosecrans and Edward Ord, each commanding two divisions, met General Price's force at Iuka. After a fierce fight which cost Price approximately 500 casualties, he turned away and regrouped with General Earl Van Dorn, creating a Confederate force of approximately 40,000 men ready to attack Corinth. The attack would come on October 3, and the 2nd Iowa Infantry would fight for two days in one of the most strategically important battles in the Civil War.Rosecrans, ‚ÄúThe Battle of Corinth‚Äù, 2:737-42. During the early morning of October 3, the 2nd Iowa, being a part of the First Brigade of the Second Division of the Army of the Tennessee under Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies, moved their line of defense two miles ahead from where they were currently positioned (northwest of Corinth) in order to prepare for an engagement with the enemy. The purpose of placing divisions in this vicinity was to test the assault of the enemy, and if the enemy were formidable, then the Federal troops would retreat to tighter defense works closer to the city. Not long after the sun arose on what would be an excruciatingly hot day, the confederate forces began their attack.Rosecrans, ‚ÄúThe Battle of Corinth‚Äù, 744-6. The Confederate forces attacked the 2nd Brigade with considerable force and drove them back, exposing the left flank of the 2nd Iowa. The 2nd Iowa was forced to fall back and set up a new line of defense. The lines changed in this way many times throughout the day. Eventually, the 2nd Iowa would defend an area known as ‚ÄúWhite House.‚Äù Here the 2nd Iowa repelled an enemy attack, using the high ground to their advantage. After about an hour of intense fighting, columns of Confederate reinforcements were seen in the distance. Knowing the arrival of those reinforcements would mean defeat for the regiment in the current location, Colonel Baker ordered a charge which drove the remaining enemy from the open field and allowed the regiment to hold the position a while longer. During this charge Colonel Baker was mortally wounded, leaving the command of the company in the hands of the capable Noah W. Mills. The 2nd Iowa along with the rest of General Davies‚Äô division held these positions as long as possible, before being ordered by Davies to fall back slowly and begrudgingly. The 2nd Iowa fought the entire day. As night fell in, the Federal forces were pushed back to their main line of defense. The 2nd Iowa was stationed near the Robinett Battery on the left of Davies‚Äô division. After the first day of fighting, the 2nd Iowa had a total of forty- two casualties.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 61-3, 67-8; Rosecrans, ‚ÄúThe Battle of Corinth\\", 746-8; O.R. Ser. 1, Vol. XVII, pt. 1, 278-9; Weaver, Letter to Wife dated October 6, 1862. The second day of fighting would prove equally as fierce. At first daylight, the confederate army resumed the attack. Davies‚Äô division and the 2nd Iowa continually repelled enemy attacks while defending the line near the Robinett battery throughout the day. In the mid- afternoon, the Confederate forces staged one last desperate attack. The confederate forces charged at the 2nd Iowa with a large force, pushing the regiment backwards, a few of the enemy reaching the city. Here, the 2nd Iowa quickly regrouped and charged at the enemy, regaining the ground and capturing thirty-one enemy soldiers and one enemy flag. In the meantime, the final desperate charge to take the Robinett Battery occurred. Corporal John Bell of the 2nd Iowa described the final attack by the Confederates when he wrote: \\"No braver or more desperate assault was ever made, and as the shot and shells of our siege guns, accurately trained by months of skillful practice, tore dreadful gaps in the ranks of the enemy with the only effect of causing them to close up these gaps and press resistlessly forward, apparently as devoid of fear as wooden men, I thought, ‚ÄúThese are not human beings; they are devils.‚Äù\\"Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 13-4. However brave the men of the Confederate army were on the charge, their effort was of no use. Although many of the Confederate soldiers reached the Robinett battery, the nearby Phillips battery opened fire upon them forcing the men to retreat. Worn out from two long and hot days of fighting without reinforcements and dwindling supplies, the Confederate forces could not muster another attack. The Federal army remained in control of the city of Corinth.Rosecrans, ‚ÄúThe Battle of Corinth‚Äù, 749-51. The 2nd Iowa fought in the Battle for Corinth with a force numbering 346. During the two days of fighting, the 2nd Iowa suffered a total of 108 casualties. Due to the tragic fall of Colonel Baker and Lieutenant Colonel Mills, James B. Weaver was promoted to colonel and was now in command of the regiment. Henry R. Cowles, former captain of Company H was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain N. B. Howard of Company I was third in command after being promoted to major.O.R. Ser. 1, Vol. XVII, pt. 1, 278; Ingersoll, Iowa and the Rebellion, 49. The regiment remained stationed near Corinth until the spring of 1863. During this time the 2nd Iowa was placed on garrison duty. Except for two short and minor encounters at Little Bear Creek, Alabama, in November, and in Town Creek, Alabama, in April the 2nd Iowa saw little action for months following the battle of Corinth.Iowa Adjutant General‚Äôs Office, 96. At Little Bear Creek the regiment was involved in an encounter between the 16th Military Corps under Brigadier General Thomas W. Sweeny and Confederate General P. D. Roddy. At Town Creek, the regiment fought against General Roddy under Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge. In both instances, the confrontation for the 2nd Iowa was minor and no casualties were suffered. Both were within a few days march of Rienzi and Corinth.Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 19; Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 15-6. During the summer of 1863, the 2nd Iowa was stationed at La Grange, Tennessee, which is located near Corinth. For a short period of time in the summer, being placed on outpost duty became more dangerous than usual because enemy personnel were firing upon the soldiers with increased frequency. The capture of a man referred to as Johnston illustrated the cause for the increased dangers for the soldiers guarding the lines. This man, a member of the Federal army for a brief time, was actually a rebel. After joining the Federal army and learning the locations of the outposts, he deserted and formed a Confederate guerilla unit, which would attack these sites. Once captured, he was court marshaled and executed by a firing squad.Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 16-7. Furlough and Return In the fall of 1863 the 2nd Iowa marched for approximately ten days to Pulaski, Tennessee. The regiment remained a part of General Dodge's division of the Department of Tennessee. In Pulaski the 2nd Iowa was assigned to railroad guard duty. The 2nd Iowa traveled on no expeditions and were not involved in any skirmishes. Something of importance that did occur during this time, however, was the re-enlistment of a large amount of the regiment just before the end of the year. The 2nd Iowa Infantry was allowed home on furlough, returning to Pulaski in February 1864. In April 1864, the regiment left Pulaski to join the Atlanta campaign as a member of the 2nd Division of the Sixteenth Corps of the District of Tennessee. The 2nd Iowa was placed in a brigade under the command of General James McPherson.Frederick H. Dyer, A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion Compiled and Arranged from Official Records of the Federal and Confederate Armies Reports of the Adjutant Generals of the Several States, the Army Registers and Other Reliable Documents and Sources, 3 vols. (Des Moines, IA: Dyer Publishing Company, 1908), vol. 3, 1166; Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 18-9. The Final Year of the Civil War In May 1864, the 2nd Iowa became engaged in the area near Resaca, Georgia. During the days leading up to the 14th of May, the Federal forces were participating in severe skirmishing along the Snake Creek Gap without a change in the lines. On the 14th, the 2nd Iowa was ordered to cross the Oostenaula River in a flanking procedure, but was ordered back. On the 15th, the 2nd Iowa would once again cross the river and defended the location while the rest of the division crossed the river as well. The crossing of the Oostenaula River by Federal forces exposed the flank of the Confederate forces. This move forced the commander of the Confederate forces in the area, General Joseph E. Johnston, to abandon the fight on the right of his lines and pull away from Resaca. Although Resaca was evacuated, the fighting for the 2nd Iowa was not over. On May 16, the soldiers began moving south towards Rome in pursuit of General Johnston. The 2nd Iowa was deployed as skirmishers and led a successful charge to capture an enemy artillery unit at Rome crossroads.Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 19; Christy, Diary entry dated May 16, 1862. After the conflict at Rome crossroads, the command of the Regiment was placed in the hands of Noel B. Howard because Colonel Weaver did not re-enlist with the rest of the regiment in late 1863. However, Lieutenant Colonel Howard was not immediately promoted to colonel, because the numbers of the 2nd Iowa at this time were lower than that required to make a full regiment, numbering approximately 500 men.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 78. The next engagement for the men of the 2nd Iowa would take place in Dallas, Georgia, on May 27‚Äì29. The men marched close to the enemy at dusk on the 27th and established trenches and spent the night on the front, preparing for battle the next day. On the 28th, the 2nd Iowa was engaged for a short period of time, holding strong in their positions. However, during the night on the 29th, the Confederate forces launched a surprise attack against the lines that the 2nd Iowa held. After two fierce hours of fighting in the dark, the Confederate forces were turned away, unsuccessful in their efforts. The next day, the 2nd Iowa was placed in the rear of their division and did not fight again until General Johnston was forced from Dallas and made his new line of defense by Kennesaw Mountain. Throughout this time the 2nd Iowa remained under General McPherson, and actively skirmished June 10‚Äì30 on the left of the Federal forces. Eventually, Johnston and his army were forced to retreat further south. The Federal forces continued to press him closer to Atlanta. The 2nd Iowa found themselves in front of Atlanta by the middle of July. On July 22, during a skirmish in which the 2nd Iowa captured twenty prisoners and an enemy's stand of colors, General McPherson was killed and Lieutenant Colonel Howard was injured, leaving the command of the regiment in the hands of Major Matthew G. Hamill. The 2nd Iowa's division was now in the command of General Oliver O. Howard.Christy, diary entry dated May 27‚Äì30, 1864; Bell, Tramps and Triumphs, 20-21; Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 19-20; Oliver O. Howard, ‚ÄúThe Struggle for Atlanta,‚Äù in Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, eds. Robert Underwood Johnson and Clarence Clough Buel (New York: Century Company, 1887), 4:315-9; Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 79-80. As the Federal forces began surrounding Atlanta, the 2nd Iowa took part in the famous advance on Jonesboro, which is located twenty-two miles south of Atlanta. This advance, which took place on August 30, would force the Confederates to evacuate Atlanta. The advance is another example of the 2nd Iowa's impact on the Civil War. During the advance the 2nd Iowa, combined with the 7th Iowa Infantry, was to support General Kilpatrick's cavalry in seizing Jonesboro. The attack on August 30 was extremely successful; the infantry and cavalry regiments bravely charged the enemy and cleared the way for the cavalry to push the Confederate soldiers stationed there closer to Atlanta. The next day the units held the position gained, and by the second of September, the enemy had evacuated Atlanta and the surrounding area and the battle was over. During the entire campaign for Atlanta, the 2nd Iowa lost fifty-five men, eight of which were killed. The numbers of the 2nd Iowa were soon to improve, however, due to the consolidation of the remaining companies of the 3rd Iowa Infantry into the 2nd Iowa. Noah Howard was then promoted to colonel.Stuart, Iowa Colonels and Regiments, 80-1; Ingersoll, Iowa and the Rebellion, 50; Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 20; Iowa Adjutant General‚Äôs Office, 96. On December 7, the regiment encountered a light defense force on the opposite side of the Ogechee River. The 2nd Iowa was the first to cross the river and skirmished with the enemy along the road for a mile and a half before reaching a barricade. The 2nd Iowa quickly charged the barricade along with the 7th Iowa Infantry and the enemy was driven from the field. In this engagement, two men were killed and two more were wounded, all from Company E. Although more light resistance from the enemy would come, the 2nd Iowa would not be responsible for engaging the enemy troops. Sherman's army continued to march east until it surrounded Savannah, Georgia. The Confederate army in Savannah made an escape and the Federal army marched into the city on December 21, 1864.Steve Meyer, Iowa Valor (Garrison, IA: Meyer Publishing Company, 1994), 421-3. In February, the 2nd Iowa was involved in some light skirmishing in Lynch Creek, South Carolina. The regiment suffered only one casualty after the enemy fired upon the regiment as the men waded across the creek. The 2nd Iowa remained active with Sherman's army until General Johnston was forced to retreat at Bentonsville, North Carolina, in March 1865, essentially ending the war for the 2nd Iowa.Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 20. Discharge From Bentonsville, the 2nd Iowa marched to Washington, D.C., in order to partake in the celebratory festivities held there. The men returned to Davenport, Iowa, the date of the final discharge being July 20, 1865.Twombly, The Second Iowa Infantry at Fort Donelson, 22.

His versatile and melodic voice, commanding stage presence and trademark beret hats made him one of the all-time great performers of Cape Verde.\\"Ildo Lobo, Cape Verde's Greatest Male Singer Passed Away\\" at World Music Central Always well known throughout the Cape Verde Islands, Lobo rose to international fame with his first solo work, \\"N√¥s Morna\\", following it with another album \\"Intellectual\\". Biography Lobo was born on the island of Sal in the town of Pedra de Lume, where he worked alongside his family in the local salt mines during his youth. When the Cape Verdian salt industry died down, Lobo was forced to find other means of work. Luckily for Lobo, music was his first love. His voice would put him in constant demand at local bars and music festivals. Lobo's musical talent would eventually place the island of Sal permanently on the Cape Verdian musical map to rival the islands of Santiago, S√£o Vicente, and S√£o Nicolau as bona fide origins of Cape Verdian talent. Lobo consummately mastered most styles of Cape Verdian music, but he was best known on stage for his effortless, soul-stirring mornas. He could also arouse the crowd with his hard-hitting coladeras. Lobo, as an adult, moved to Praia, Santiago Island (Cape Verde's capital) where he attended Liceu Domingos Ramos and later began his career as vocalist of the band Os Tubar√µes (\\"The Sharks\\"). After his stellar multi-album career with Os Tubar√µes, Lobo launched his solo career with his acclaimed album N√¥s Morna launched in 1996, the album was produced by M√°rio L√∫cio of the Simentera band, it was recorded at Lusafrica in Paris. Ildo Lobo along with Fantcha performed in Paris at a concert on 27 March 1998. His second album was Intellectual released in 2001 and featured the greatest singer Ces√°ria √âvora. Like many Cape Verdian musicians of his day, Lobo maintained a full-time job as an airport customs officer despite having a busy traveling concert and studio recording schedule. His last work, Incondicional, was released in October 2004, a few days after his death in Praia at age 51.\\"Cape Verde mourns Creole singer Ildo Lobo\\" at afrol News Most sources state that he died of a heart attack, but some Cape Verdian sources claim that he died of diabetes related complications. Lobo's popularity was such that all public employees in the city of Praia were given the afternoon off to mourn. In his island birthplace, Sal, all government offices were closed and flags were flown at half-staff for three days. His last album was produced by the keyboardist Fernando \\"Nando\\" Andrade. According to worldmusiccentral.com, \\"Lobo was one of those men whose political message was inseparably linked to the musical expression and poetry of mornas\\" and the site named Lobo \\"Cape Verde's Greatest Male Singer.\\" Lobo's death in 2004 sparked mourning throughout the world music scene and throughout the vastly diasporized Cape Verdian population of over 1 million, who, despite living in far away communities in Paris; Amsterdam; Lisbon; and the American states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Florida, still maintain close language, cultural and familial bonds to their beloved islands.

It is assumed that most of them were founded in the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century. The name was first mentioned in 1199. The inhabitants of newly founded villages had obligations towards suzerains, but those duties were usually suspended for a certain period (such as 5‚Äì8 years) as a compensation for felling of forests and making the land available for agriculture. This period used to be called \\"lh√≥ta\\" (= 'due period') and often became a part of the village name. There are about 500 villages called Lhota or a derivation of this name (Lhotka, Lhotice, Lhoty, Lh≈Øty in the Czech Republic; Lehota or Leh√≥tka in Slovakia). The largest of them is Ostro≈æsk√° Lhota in the Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ District. Most of them are in East, South-East and South Bohemia, outside the oldest inhabited area. Therefore, it is assumed that they were founded in the latter part of colonization process, on less fertile land on higher altitudes. They were usually established by local inhabitants, namely smaller noblemen close to their own village. The name of the founder, usually of a Slavonic origin, became sometimes a part of village name (e.g., Vlachova Lhota). In other cases, the adjective in village name relates to its size (Dlouh√° Lhota ‚Äì Long L.) or other characteristics (Doln√≠ Lhota ‚Äì Lower L., P√≠skov√° Lhota ‚Äì Sandy L.).

Kuchuk Hanem became a key figure and symbol in Flaubert's Orientalist accounts of the East. Flaubert visited her during his sojourn in Egypt on his journey to the East in 1849-51 accompanied by Maxime Du Camp. The orientalist themes that pervade his work depended heavily on his experiences in Egypt and his likely sexual liaison with Kuchuk Hanem. Dancers in two of his novellas, Herodias and Temptation of Saint Anthony, evoke a woman dancer who performs scenes from Salome and the Queen of Sheba. Both of these dances were standards of the repertoire of dancers of this period, especially a dance step known as \\"the bee\\" or \\"the wasp,\\" with the dancer standing musing in a pensive posture until a buzzing insect flies into her clothing and she \\"flees\\" in terror, dancing rapidly, and removing articles of clothing in the manner of a provocative strip-tease. Later, Kuchuk Hanem was the subject of an 1851 poem by Louis Bouilhet, \\"Kuchuk-Hanem, Souveneer\\" which was inspired by Flaubert's accounts from letters. Louise Colet, a mistress of Flaubert, is said to have sought out the aging dancer on a trip to Egypt at the time of the opening of the Suez Canal, in order to report back to Flaubert the ravages that time had wrought on the woman he so admired. It seems certain that she was also an influence on George William Curtis, suggesting that she was one of the most sought-after entertainers in Upper Egypt during the colonial period. Comparisons of the two narratives demonstrate a house with a courtyard, a stairway in poor repair leading to an upper room furnished with two divans, a young female attendant named Zeneb, an old man playing a rebaba, and an old woman who kept time on the tar. \\"Kuchuk Hanem\\" is not a proper name and actually means \\"little lady\\" in Turkish (k√º√ß√ºk hanƒ±m). It might be a term of endearment applied to a child, a lover, or a famous dancer. Flaubert reports that she was from Damascus, but it remains unclear if this was a name chosen by the woman to represent herself to the colonial tourists or if this is a casual shorthand name used by the two writers to describe her. The sensationalized and eroticized presence of Kuchuk Hanem within the literature of this period underscores early misrepresentations of non-western women in the imagination of the West.Said, Edward W., 1979, Orientalism, New York, Vintage, pp. 186-190.

The station joined the network in August 1980, following the opening of the line between Haymarket and Tynemouth ‚Äì the first stage of the network to open. The station originally opened in March 1933, as part of the London and North Eastern Railway, with the station building constructed in Art Deco style. The station was used by 384,731 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the eighth-most-used station in North Tyneside. History Monkseaton had been served by a station since 1864. However, the development of new housing in the area adjoining the line led the London and North Eastern Railway to construct an additional station, about west along the line from the station at Monkseaton. West Monkseaton opened in March 1933, with the platforms taking just a month to build after plans were approved. The reinforced concrete Art Deco station building is attributed to the London and North Eastern Railway architect, H. H. Powell. Work on the station building, however, did not begin until 1934. Staircases and ramps led down from this building to two timber platforms, both of which featured waiting rooms. The westbound platform featured a concrete canopy, which was added by the London and North Eastern Railway, following the construction of the waiting rooms. Prior to the station's closure for conversion in the late 1970s, the station generally received a service every 20 minutes in both directions, on the Coast Circle route. The service from West Monkseaton to Newcastle via South Gosforth was removed in January 1978, in order to facilitate conversion work on the stations to the west. This meant that the station was briefly a terminus for trains from Newcastle via Tynemouth, with trains reversing using a crossover to the west of the station. The station closed for conversion in September 1979, ahead of opening as part of the Tyne and Wear Metro network, re-opening in August 1980. Conversion work saw the loss of the wooden station buildings at platform level, as well as the replacement of the timber platforms with shorter concrete ones. The canopy on the westbound platform (trains towards St. James) was retained, while a smaller canopy in a similar style was added to the eastbound platform (trains towards South Shields). The original street-level entrance building remains, and was refurbished in 1999, along with the original London and North Eastern Railway platform canopy. As part of this refurbishment, an art installation by Richard Talbot, Bridge, was commissioned. It features a number of coloured stained glass windows, and is located in the station's ticket hall, overlooking the track and platforms. West Monkseaton was recently refurbished, along with Cullercoats and Monkseaton, in 2018, as part of the Metro: All Change programme. The refurbishment involved the installation of new seating and lighting, resurfaced platforms, and improved security and accessibility. The station was also painted in to the new black and white corporate colour scheme. Facilities Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramped access to both platforms. The station is equipped with ticket machines, waiting shelter, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network. There is no dedicated car parking available at the station. There is the provision for cycle parking, with 3 cycle lockers and 5 cycle pods available for use. Service and frequency West Monkseaton is served by the , which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes. Services from platform 1 operate towards South Shields, with the first train departing at 05:44 (05:46 on Saturday and 06:38 on Sunday). Services from platform 2 operate towards St. James via Whitley Bay, with the first train departing at 05:20 (05:38 on Saturday and 06:23 on Sunday). Trains run frequently across the network, at intervals of up to every 12 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime), and every 15 minutes (evening and Sunday), with the last trains departing at around midnight. Additional trains run during morning and evening peak hours (Monday to Friday) between Pelaw and Monkseaton. This provides up to 10 trains per hour through the station at peak times.

An infusion is also the name for the resultant liquid. The process of infusion is distinct from both decoction‚Äîa method of extraction involving boiling the plant material‚Äîand percolation, in which water is passed through the material (as in a coffeemaker). History The first recorded use of essential oils was in the 10th or 11th century by the Persian polymath Avicenna, possibly in The Canon of Medicine. Tea is far older than this, dating back to the 10th century BC as the earliest recorded reference. Preparation techniques Infusion is a chemical process that uses botanicals (typically dried herbs, flowers or berries) that are volatile and release their active ingredients readily in water, oil, or alcohol. In this process, a liquid is typically boiled (or brought to another appropriate temperature) and poured over the herb. After the herb has been allowed to steep in the liquid for an appropriate period of time, it is removed (possibly by straining) leaving an infusion. Unless the infusion is to be consumed immediately, it is bottled and refrigerated for future use. The amount of time the herbs are left in the liquid depends on the kind of infusion. Infusion times can range from seconds (for some kinds of Chinese tea) to hours, days, or months (for liqueurs like Sloe Gin). There are several accessories and techniques for removing the steeped or leftover botanicals that were used to infuse liquids, including metal steepers (which look like clamps), tea infusers (which act as strainers), and french presses (which are commonly used to infuse water with various teas and coffee). The most commonly used technique is the teabag, which is made with filter paper and filled with various tea flavors. =Examples= thumbrightLeft side: Lime, ginger and mint infused water Right side: Pomegranate infused water Mate A common example of an infusion is tea; most varieties of tea call for steeping the leaves in hot water, although some variants (e.g. Moroccan mint tea) call for decoction instead. Many herbal teas are prepared by infusion, as well; lemon, chamomile, senna, apple, ginger, rooibos, and many other plants are used individually or in combination. Herbal infusions in water and oil are both commonly used as herbal remedies. Coffee can also be made through infusion (as in a French press), but is more often made through percolation. Plants with desirable flavors may be steeped in an edible oil or vinegar for an extended period; the infused oil or vinegar is often sold still containing the plant and is then used as flavoring. Chilis, lemon, garlic, and many other plants may be used. There can be ambiguity in the labeling of these oils: for example, what is described as sesame oil may be oil extracted from sesame seeds or another vegetable oil infused with sesame.

The regiment would see action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, and Green Spring. The regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1783.  Establishment  The regiment was authorized in December 1775 as the 5th Pennsylvania Battalion. The regiment participated in the unsuccessful defense of New York City and was captured in part at Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, along with its commander, Colonel Robert Magaw. On January 1, 1777, the survivors of the 5th Battalion, along with exchanged prisoners and new recruits, were reorganized into the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment. Most of the regiment's men were recruited from Berks and Chester counties, although many came from Philadelphia and as far away as Northumberland County. During 1777, the regiment participated in the Philadelphia Campaign and fought at the Battles of Brandywine (September 11) and Germantown (October 4). At Brandywine, the women of the 6th Pennsylvania were cited for their bravery under fire while bringing water to the men. The regiment spent the winter of 1777-78 at Valley Forge and took part in the Battle of Monmouth (June 28) the following summer. In 1779, the light infantry company of the 6th Pennsylvania was part of the Corps of Light Infantry commanded by \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne that stormed the British fortifications at Stony Point, NY (July 16). The regiment spent the rest of the year in garrison at West Point and probably wintered at Morristown. The next year, the regiment took part in a number of small engagements in New Jersey and again wintered at Morristown. On New Year's Day, 1781, members of the 6th Pennsylvania joined the mutiny of the Pennsylvania regiments then quartered at Morristown. After a settlement was reached, the regiment was furloughed at Trenton on January 17. Soldiers remaining in the regiment were reassigned to other units and eventually sent south to take part in the Yorktown Campaign. The regiment was officially disbanded in January, 1783, although in reality, no regiment had existed since 1781. However, historian Mark Boatner asserts that on 26 May 1781 Wayne went south with 1,000 men and six guns of the 2nd, 5th, and 6th Pennsylvania and the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment. They joined Gilbert Motier, marquis de La Fayette in Virginia on 10 June.Boatner, 1177 Colonel Richard Humpton led his troops at the Battle of Green Spring on 6 July, though on this occasion, Boatner refers to the unit as a battalion.Boatner, 451-452  Brief History of the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment  November 16, 1776 ‚Äî Formerly known as the 5th Pennsylvania Battalion the entire unit was captured at Fort Washington, New York. The enlisted men were held by the British until December 26, 1776, when they were set free on parole. January to June 1777 ‚Äî During this period the unit was reorganized as the 6th Regiment with Colonel Henry Bicker as its commander. Many of the men who served in 1776 reenlisted and to these were added new recruits to fill out the regiment. In June the men refused to report at camp for duty as they thought they were still on parole and had not been properly exchanged. These concerns were overcome and the regiment joined the army later in the month. June 26, 1777 ‚Äî As part of Lord Stirling's Division the regiment probably joined the army in time to participate in the battle of Short Hills. July to August 1777 ‚Äî With the rest of Washington's army the 6th Regiment marched back and forth across New Jersey and into New York and Pennsylvania while trying to ascertain the destination of General Howe's army, which had embarked on the British fleet. During this time the brigade under General Thomas Conway, to which the 6th Regiment belonged, was reputed to be \\"the best instructed and disciplined\\" in the army. This was in spite of the fact that he \\"is detested by the officers of his brigade... because he makes his brigade work and personally drills and instructs it, instead of leaving it idle in camp.

He played college football at Elizabeth City State College. Early years Born in Windsor, North Carolina, Pugh graduated from its W. S. Etheridge High School and enrolled at nearby Elizabeth City State College at the age of 16. He played college football for the Vikings on offense and defense and became a two-time All-CIAA defensive end in 1963 and 1964. He is one of five persons to have his jersey retired by the school, now Elizabeth City State University. In 1979, he was inducted into the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Hall of Fame. In 1980, he was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. In 1981, he was inducted into the ECSU Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame. Professional career Pugh was selected in the eleventh round (145th overall) of the 1965 NFL draft, by the Dallas Cowboys, and was also offered a contract to play with the Oakland Raiders of the AFL. He was only 20 years old when he started his professional career as a backup defensive end for the Cowboys. At the end of the 1966 season, he was moved to left defensive tackle replacing Jim Colvin in the starting lineup. He played with the Cowboys for his entire career, from 1965 through 1978. His 14 seasons represent the fourth-longest career in Cowboys history; only Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones, Bill Bates, and Mark Tuinei played more years. In the final seconds of the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the famous Ice Bowl at Green Bay, Pugh was blocked by Packers' guard Jerry Kramer for the game-deciding touchdown. Kramer's block cleared the way for Bart Starr to score on a 1-yard quarterback sneak with 16 seconds remaining, lifting Vince Lombardi's team to a 21‚Äì17 victory and an unprecedented third consecutive title game win in weather at Lambeau Field. It was the second consecutive season that Dallas had fallen to the Packers in the championship game; the previous year was a close game in the Cotton Bowl. Always a team player, Pugh carried on through the 1971 season with a case of appendicitis and delayed his surgery until the offseason, by taking shots of penicillin. Although he was widely regarded as an excellent player and received All-Pro honors, he was never voted to a Pro Bowl. Pugh's achievements as a professional athlete were largely overshadowed for most of his career by his defensive line teammates, who were Pro Bowl regulars. When Pugh started, he had to compete for attention with future Hall of Famer Bob Lilly and George Andrie; when they retired, Pugh played in the same defensive line with Randy White, Harvey Martin, and Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones. Even though he was a physical player against the run, his athleticism enabled him to become an excellent pass rusher for a defensive tackle. While quarterback sacks were not an official NFL statistic during his career, Pugh is unofficially credited with a career total of 95.5. He led the Cowboys in sacks each season from 1968 to 1972 with a high mark of 15.5 in 1968, a team record that stood until 2010 when DeMarcus Ware reached six straight seasons. He averaged 12¬Ω sacks, during one amazing stretch of his career (1968‚Äì1972) and currently ranks sixth on the Cowboys all-time sacks list with 95.5.http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/12134583/former-dallas-cowboys- defensive-standout-jethro-pugh-dead-70 Following the 1978 season and Super Bowl XIII, Pugh retired on January 29, 1979, after helping the Cowboys win two Super Bowls, five NFC Championships, qualify for the NFL post-season in 12 out of 14 seasons, and played in a then league record 23 playoff games.

In early 1865, Winnebago again supported Union forces during the Mobile Campaign as they attacked Confederate fortifications defending the city of Mobile, Alabama.

The engines were designed to reach a top speed of . Chickasaw carried of coal. The ship's main armament consisted of four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin- gun turrets. Her forward turret was designed by James Eads and her rear turret by John Ericsson. Each gun weighed approximately and could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +15¬∞.Olmstead, et al, p. 90 The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of wrought iron plates. The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one-inch plates, backed by of pine. The deck was heavily cambered to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates thick. The pilothouse, positioned behind and above the fore turret, was protected by of armor.Canney, pp. 114‚Äì16 Construction and service James Eads was awarded the contracts for all four of the Milwaukee-class ships. He laid down Winnebago at his Union Iron Works Carondelet, St. Louis in 1862. The first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the Indian tribe, she was launched on 4 July 1863 and commissioned on 27 April 1864.Winnebago Initially assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron, Winnebago operated on the Mississippi River defending Union ships against Confederate raids and ambushes for several months. She was transferred to Rear Admiral David Farragut's West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 9 July, together with her sister . The ship required some time to refit at New Orleans and prepare for the voyage to Mobile across the Gulf of Mexico, so the two sisters did not depart New Orleans until 29 July. On the voyage down the Mississippi to the Pass A Loutre, Chickasaw was forced to anchor overnight because of steering problems and the two ships did not cross the sandbar at the mouth of the pass until the evening of the following day. Once in the Gulf, Winnebago was taken under tow by the sidewheel gunboat for the voyage across the Gulf. Farragut inspected the monitor after her arrival and was dismayed to learn that one of her turrets had jammed. He also preferred to have a more experienced officer in command and appointed Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr. as her new captain.Friend, pp. 64, 108, 110, 114‚Äì18, 198 Farragut's plan for the battle was relatively simple. The larger, more heavily armed monitors and were to keep the ironclad ram away from the vulnerable wooden ships while they were passing Fort Morgan and then sink her. Chickasaw and Winnebago were to engage the fort until all of the wooden ships had passed. The four monitors would form the starboard column of ships, closest to Fort Morgan, with Winnebago in the rear, while the wooden ships formed a separate column to port. The eastern side of the channel closest to Fort Morgan was free of obstacles, but \\"torpedoes\\", as mines were called at the time, were known to be present west of a prominent black buoy in the channel.Friend, pp. 158, 178 The two Milwaukee-class ships bombarded Fort Morgan for about an hour and a half while the wooden ships passed through the mouth of Mobile Bay; Winnebago beginning at 07:15 even though her forward turret was still jammed in place. About three-quarters of an hour later, Tecumseh struck a \\"torpedo\\" and sank rapidly. Winnebago took on board 10 survivors from the ill-fated Tecumseh who had been rescued by a boat from Metacomet under heavy fire and passed Ft. Morgan at 08:30.ORN, vol. 21, pp. 496‚Äì7 After Tennessee first attacked Stevens' former command, the gunboat , he was able to interpose Winnebago between the two ships in case the Confederate ironclad turned around for another attack, but it disengaged and briefly sought the shelter of Ft. Morgan's guns.Friend, pp. 198‚Äì99 Around 09:10 the traversing gear for the rear turret broke down, only five minutes before Winnebago received the order to attack the Tennessee after it had sortied into the middle of Mobile Bay to attack the Union squadron. The monitor was forced to turn the entire ship to bring her guns to bear and did not play a significant part in the second phase of the battle before Tennessee was forced to surrender at 09:45. During the battle, Winnebago was hit 19 times, three of which penetrated the deck near her aft turret, although she suffered no casualties. Despite the problems with her turrets, the ship managed to fire 56 shells, a mixture of solid shot, explosive shells, grapeshot, canister shot, and shrapnel shells.ORN, vol. 21, pp. 497‚Äì98 Winnebago intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered, on 24 and 6 August, respectively.ORN, vol. 21, pp. 825‚Äì26 On the night of 8 August, Commander Stevens sent a boat crew under the command of Acting Ensign Michael Murphy on a successful mission to cut the telegraph cable between Fort Morgan and the city of Mobile. The fort surrendered on 24 August and the ship remained at Mobile Bay into 1865 supporting Union forces. On 27 March, Union forces advanced on Spanish Fort as the first step in capturing Mobile. The Navy's role was to bombard the defenses and to interdict their communications with Mobile, but the defenders had sown mines in great numbers in the waterways. The Navy successfully swept many of these, but could not completely clear the rivers. Winnebago and her sister sailed upriver on 28 March to attack a Confederate transport and forced it to retreat, but Milwaukee struck a mine, in an area previously swept, as they were returning downriver. She remained afloat forward, which permitted her crew to escape without loss.ORN, vol. 22, p. 71 Winnebago later protected a convoy carrying some 13,000 troops under Major General Frederick Steele, to Selma and Montgomery, Alabama later in April. By 28 April, the monitor, together with the gunboats and , was blockading the Confederate ironclad Nashville and the gunboat Morgan up the Tombigbee River,ORN, vol. 22, p. 139 until their surrender. Winnebago was placed in ordinary on the Algiers side of the Mississippi, across from New Orleans, on 27 September. She was renamed twice during that time, first to Tornado on 15 June 1869 and then she resumed her original name on 10 August 1869. Winnebago was sold at auction on 12 September 1874.

He first came into notability at Libertad in Paraguay, transferring to Estudiantes in 1995, where he established himself and received his first call-up for Paraguay national team. In 1999, he moved to Benfica, but less than a year and half later was back at Argentina, playing for River Plate until 2006. He represented Paraguay seven times, being a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Posadas, at the Argentine province of Misiones, Rojas played for Argentinos Juniors at the same time as Christian Dollberg in 1991. He moved to Cerro Cor√° in the same year and participated in their campaign in the Primera Divisi√≥n. In 1992, he joined the larger Club Libertad, where he secured a place in the first team, amassing over 50 league matches in three seasons. After five years in Paraguay, Rojas returned to Argentina, signing with Estudiantes. In Estudiantes, he played the left-back role for four seasons with more than 120 league appearances, but without winning any silverware. In July 1999, the 28-year-old moved abroad and joined Benfica, alongside his teammate, Carlos Bossio;in what he labelled the transfer as the highest point in his career. According to Record, the fee for both was three million dollars. He made his debut on 12 September, in a 3‚Äì0 away win against Santa Clara, and went on to play 30 games in all competitions, mainly as a right- back. However, in 2000‚Äì01, the signings of Ivan Dudiƒá on the right, and the breakthrough of Diogo Lu√≠s on the left, severely diminished his playing time, so in February 2001, he was loaned to River Plate. His pay-check there was a reported 500 thousand dollars, one of highest in the league. Initially, under Am√©rico Gallego, he could only play in the Copa Libertadores due to his late arrival in the season. In 2001‚Äì02, already with Ram√≥n D√≠az in charge, Rojas alternated with Mat√≠as Lequi on the left and despite speculation that he would be released, he signed on permanent deal in early 2002. On 11 March 2002, he scored his only top tier goal, in a 3‚Äì0 victory of River over its main rivals, Boca Juniors. After scoring that goal, he was nicknamed vaseline. He would play for River for a further four years, retiring in 2007 after a brief spell at Belgrano. After football, he became a farmer and moved back to his home- town. International career Despite being born in Argentina, Rojas grandparents were from Paraguay. He hoped of playing for Argentina but the stiff competition made it difficult for him to ever receive a call-up, so he opted to represent Paraguay instead, as he explained in 1999: \\"My grandparents were Paraguayans and before I played in Argentina, I had already received a call-up to play for Paraguay. Still, I turned it down because my ambition was to play for the Argentina national team, but I sound figured out my chances or slim. Just before the World Cup in France, I was invited again by the Paraguayan Football Association and ended up accepting it and representing Paraguay in the World Cup.\\" He was listed in squad for the 1997 Copa Am√©rica, and was a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but did not make any appearances. In total, he received 7 call-ups from 1997 to 1998.

He was born in Lucerne, as the eighth of 14 children, to cartographer, historian and folklorist Renward Cysat (1545‚Äì1614). In 1604, Cysat joined the Jesuits and became a theology student in March 1611 in Ingolstadt. There he met Christoph Scheiner, whom he assisted in the latter‚Äôs observation of sunspots, whose discovery would later become a matter of dispute between Galileo and Scheiner. In 1618, Cysat was named professor of mathematics at the University of Ingolstadt, succeeding Scheiner in this position, thereby allowing him to concern himself further with astronomical problems. Cysat became one of the first to make use of the newly developed telescope. Cysat and comets Cysat's most important work was on comets, and he observed the comet of 1618. He published a monograph on the comet called Mathemata astronomica de loco, motu, magnitudine et causis cometae qui sub finem anni 1618 et initium anni 1619 in coelo fulsit. Ingolstadt Ex Typographeo Ederiano 1619 (Ingolstadt, 1619). According to Cysat‚Äôs opinion, comets circled around the sun, and he demonstrated at the same time that the orbit of the comet was parabolic, not circular. Cysat‚Äôs observations on the comet are characterized by their great detail. Cysat saw enough detail to be the first to describe cometary nuclei, and was able to track the progression of the nucleus from a solid shape to one filled with starry particles. Cysat‚Äôs drawings of cometary nuclei were included on the maps of others. His observations of the comet were so detailed that in 1804, he was still considered one of its excellent observers. This work also includes Cysat‚Äôs observations on the Orion Nebula (he is sometimes, probably erroneously, credited with its discovery), which he compared to the nature of the comet. Cysat‚Äôs book is also remarkable due to the fact that it had been printed by a woman, Elizabeth Angermar. During the seventeenth century, regulations laid down by printing guilds sometimes allowed widows and daughters to take over their husbands‚Äô or fathers‚Äô businesses. Other work Cysat observed the full lunar eclipse of 1620. He served as rector at the Jesuit College in Lucerne from 1624 to 1627. After a stay in Spain in 1627, where he taught at the Jesuit Colegio Imperial de Madrid, he returned to Ingolstadt in 1630 and served as rector in Innsbruck in 1637 and Eichst√§tt in 1646. Johannes Kepler visited Cysat in Ingolstadt, but only one letter of their correspondence, dated February 23, 1621, survives. On November 7, 1631, Cysat observed the partial coverage of the sun by the planet Mercury (Merkurdurchgang) predicted by Kepler. Cysat subsequently returned to his hometown of Lucerne, where he died on March 17, 1657.

Most of the species have showy tubular flowers with five, usually rounded, petal lobes and are becoming increasingly popular as houseplants in temperate regions, much like their cousins the African violets. Chirita comes from a Nepalese common name for a gentian. Taxonomic changes The genus Chirita is no longer recognized, with many species transferred to the genera Primulina, Microchirita, and Deinostigma, and several more (including the type species) to Henckelia. However, the former genus name is still sometimes used in horticultural literature, especially for the most commonly cultivated species, Chirita sinensis (now Primulina dryas). General cultivation Most can be grown in pots in warm (though some are known to tolerate colder conditions), humid conditions and can be propagated from seed (sown in the late winter) or by taking cuttings in the spring and summer.

Brigida was an ideal foil for the band's songs, combining the steady time-keeping of Charlie Watts with the flash of Keith Moon. The group's first release was a self-produced single, \\"Not Quite Right\\", which never made it onto an LP, with \\"Long Time Away\\" as the B-side. The original bass player, Robb Michael Inglis, split with the group during contract negotiations in 1974. Management & the group paid him to release his tracks and essentially disappeared him from the group's history. His bass tracks are featured on Brat, \\"Not Quite Right\\", the original 45 release B-side,\\" Long Time Away\\" and the first album release of \\"New York City\\". Steve Cooper was chosen as his replacement. \\"Long Time Away\\" was re-recorded for their first album with an increased tempo and more pop feeling. Armed with a demo tape, Gary Cox traveled to New York City in search of a record deal and received an offer from the Leber-Krebs management firm, whose biggest act was Aerosmith. They were signed to Columbia Records and paired with Aerosmith producer Jack Douglas. After being forced to choose a new name (another Brat had prior claim), Artful Dodger released their self-titled debut album in September 1975.Pantsios, Anastasia. \\"Artful Dodger's styles, tunes land label early\\" The Plain Dealer November 28, 1975: Action Tab p.9 Produced with a refreshing lack of clutter by Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, Alice Cooper), Artful Dodger was a near-masterpiece that combined the best aspects of hard rock and Beatles- derived pop. \\"Wayside\\" has become the acknowledged classic, but the rest of the album, particularly the explosive \\"Think Think\\" and Cox's ballad, \\"Silver and Gold,\\" is outstanding. Reportedly, the label's choice of the latter song as the album's lead single (not to mention a stunning lack of sales) was the beginning of a rift between Cox and the rest of the band. This didn't seem to make much of a difference, however, on the next album, Honor Among Thieves, which expanded upon the band's mastery of classic pop with a harder edge and more accomplished performances. Co-produced by Douglas and Eddie Leonetti, the album featured the power ballad \\"Scream\\" as the single. Once again, however, the record failed to sell. The press was supportive and the band toured relentlessly, but to no avail. They did a stint during the summer of 1976 opening for KISS. By the release of Babes On Broadway (1977), the strain of the band's experiences in the star-making machinery (including writing and recording three albums in three years) began to show. Produced exclusively by Eddie Leonetti, critical accolades on Babes On Broadway were fewer, with \\"Can't Stop Pretending\\" standing out as the pick-to-click. It didn't, of course (click, that is), and Artful Dodger found themselves back on the street sans management, record deal, and founding member Gary Cox. Happily, the band regrouped with piano/guitar whiz Peter Bonta (previously with the Nighthawks and Rosslyn Mountain Boys) filling in for guitarist Cox, and they signed to Ariola Records in 1980. The intervening three years had been eventful ones for rock music - punk happened, and power pop coalesced into an identifiable, coherent sound. On their first and only Ariola release (and their last overall), Artful Dodger is perhaps guilty of a self-conscious attempt to jump on the very bandwagon they helped create. The redeeming factor is, they succeeded magnificently. Artful Dodger's Rave On is an unqualified (if unheralded) power pop classic, contrasting starkly with Babes On Broadway in that highlights are difficult to pick among a record so consistently fine. Certainly, however, \\"She's Just My Baby\\" warrants mention as an absolutely perfect pop single; Rave On, in fact, stands toe-to-toe with albums as great (and famous) as Raspberries' Fresh and Badfinger's Straight Up. Artful Dodger plays as if they had something to prove (they didn't) and as if their life depended on it (it did), and their energy fairly leaps from the grooves. Everything, including continued praises from the critics, seemed to point towards success at long last, but it was not to be. In a marketplace cluttered with skinny-tied popsters (and poseurs), Artful Dodger had become just one more band for the industry to toss against the wall of public taste, hoping they'd stick. Billy Paliselli, whose raspy, impassioned vocals and pretty boy looks were key to the band's appeal, left to spend more time with his family (he eventually opened a motorcycle shop in Amissville, VA) and in 1982, a dispirited Artful Dodger broke up. The rhythm section of Steve Cooper and Steve Brigida partnered with Washington DC guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Jeff Smith and continue to record and play live with Smith as the Band of Steves. Peter Bonta opened his own recording studio, Wally Cleaver's, located in northern Virginia. He produced, engineered and played on solo projects for Gary Herrewig (the unreleased Four Gone Conclusions), Billy Paliselli and Gary Cox (a set of country demos shopped unsuccessfully to Nashville). Bonta also found steady work recording and touring with Mary Chapin Carpenter. In 1991, Artful Dodger played two reunion shows in Cleveland, Ohio (where they still get airplay) for the Cleveland Agora's 25th anniversary and appeared at the Legends of Rock Reunion '91 event held in Parkman, Ohio, but the reunion didn't take. Sony briefly issued Honor Among Thieves on CD in the early 1990s, and the first two LPs were both reissued on CD by Pendulum Entertainment Group in 1997. In 2008, American Beat Records re-issued Honor Among Thieves. In 2017, Real Gone Music issued a 2-CD set The Complete Columbia Recordings, making the Babes on Broadway album available on CD for the first time. Rave On has yet to see a legitimate CD release. Due in large part to a resurgence of fan interest on the internet, Artful Dodger reunited once again to kick off a year-long series of \\"flashback\\" concerts to celebrate the Cleveland Agora's 40th anniversary. This reunion show occurred on December 31, 2005. The band returned to the Agora for a show on April 1, 2006 and played at the annual Taste of Cleveland event on September 2, 2006. The band last performed on May 3, 2008, once again at the Cleveland Agora. The band continues to practice together and interacts with fans on the internet. Their performance at the Cleveland Agora on November 21, 2009 was recorded live to multi-track by Lava Room Recording.

He was also known as Fujiwara no Toshinari\\"...there is the further problem, the rendition of the name in romanized form. Teika probably referred to himself as Sadaie, and his father probably called himself Toshinari, but the Sino-Japanese versions of their names were used by their contemporaries, and this practice is still observed.\\" or Shakua (ÈáàÈòø); in his younger days (1123‚Äì67), he gave his name as Akihiro (È°ïÂ∫É), but in 1167, changed to Shunzei. He was noted for his innovations in the waka poetic form, and for his achievement in compiling Senzai Wakash≈´ (\\"Collection of a Thousand Years\\"), the seventh Imperial anthology of waka poetry; this work was at the behest in 1183 of the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who despite Shunzei's low rank (he was merely \\"Chamberlain to the Empress Dowager\\", a nominal rank Miner describes as \\"pitiably low\\" ), admired him. Go-Shirakawa's trust in Shunzei is significant, as Imperial anthologies were landmarks in the poetic circles of the court, second to no other events in significance; poets were literally willing to risk their lives just for the chance to have a poem included. The Tale of the Heike relates that Shunzei was compiling the Senzai Wakash≈´ during the Genpei War, and that Taira no Tadanori (1144-1184; he was on the opposing side, the one which did not hold the capital where Shunzei lived) ventured into enemy territory to Shunzei's residence, asking him to include a particular poem of his, and then managed to successfully escape back to his own forces without being apprehended. Shunzei eventually did decide to include Tadanori's poem, but attributed it (\\"tactfully\\" as Keene characterizes it) to \\"Anonymous.\\" His son, Fujiwara no Teika, is considered one of the four best poets in Japanese history. The distinguished elderly Shunzei. Shunzei was a member of the famous poetic and aristocratic clan, the Fujiwara. As his father and grandfather and a number of other relatives were all men of literature and poetry, he began writing and composing poetry at a young age. He tended to hew to an older style of poetry such as that seen in the Man'y≈çsh≈´, but he also drew upon recently imported and translated T'ang dynasty Chinese poetry. From a literary criticism perspective, he notably was an early supporter of theTale of Genji, and past his 30s and 40s, he was especially known for his criticism\\"The high quality of poetic theory (karon) in this age depends chiefly upon the poetic writings of Fujiwara Shunzei and his son Teika. The other theorists of tanka writing, stimulated by father and son either to agreement or disagreement, contributed also toward the high level of poetic theory, but we may say that Shunzei and Teika were most representative of the age.\\" This quote is sourced to Odagiri Hideo in pg 10 of his \\"Nihon ni okeru bungei hy≈çron no seiritsu\\" (The Rise of Art Criticism in Japan), pub. by Geijutsuron-sh≈´ (\\"Collection of Discussions of Art\\"), Tokyo 1962; see Shun'ichi H. Takayanagi 's review of Japanese Court Poetry by Robert H. Brower and Earl Miner in Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 18, No. 1/4. (1963), pp. 352-364. and judgments at various poetry gatherings and contests, where he favored poems that displayed his preferred poetic style of yugen (one of the ten orthodox styles of poetry which focused on conveying romantic emotion, with characteristic undertones of nostalgia and regret); his style was sometimes summarized as \\"old diction, new treatment\\". He wrote that poems \\"should somehow... produce an effect of both charm and of mystery and depth. If it is a good poem, it will possess a kind of atmosphere distinct from its words and their configuration and yet accompanying them.\\"Miner attributes the source for his translation to Shunzei's \\"Jichin Osh≈ç Jikaawase in NKGT, II, 358.\\" (\\"NKGT\\" here refers to the Nihon Kagaku Taikei edited by N, Sasaki and published in Tokyo in 1935, and its various reprints.) An example: His style was disciplined, determinedly sensitive and emotional; the poet Shinkei (140-1475) wrote this description of Shunzei's composition of poetry: :\\"Very late at night he would sit by his bed in front of an oil lamp so dim it was difficult to tell whether it was burning or not, and with a tattered court robe thrown over his shoulders and an old court cap pulled down to his ears, he would lean on an armrest, hugging a wooden brazier for warmth, while he recited verse to himself in an undertone. Deep into the night, when everyone else was asleep, he would sit there bent over, weeping softly.\\"pg. 34; Miner adds this in a footnote: \\"Sasamegoto, NKGT, V, 268\\". An Introduction to Japanese Court Poetry, by Earl Miner. 1968, Stanford University Press, LC 68-17138 However, Shun'ichi H. Takayanagi in his review of Japanese Court Poetry by Robert H. Brower and Earl Miner (Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 18, No. 1/4. (1963), pp. 352‚Äì364. ) says that this quote is actually from Shunzei's son, Teika, when Teika was describing his father to his son, Tameie. At the age of 63, in 1177, Shunzei \\"retired from the world\\" and took Buddhist vows, taking the religious name of \\"Shakua\\". Most of his critical philosophy of poetry is known from his sole major work of criticism, written a decade (in 1197, and revised in 1201) after he was asked by the Emperor to compile the anthology, F≈´teish≈ç (\\"Notes on Poetic Style Through the Ages\\"). His son, Fujiwara no Teika, would succeed him in prominence as a poet, and would be more successful in court politics than his father; Shunzei attained only the rank of \\"Chamberlain to the Empress Dowager\\". Shunzei's granddaughter, Fujiwara Toshinari no Musume (c. 1200; often simply called \\"Shunzei's Daughter\\" as little seems to be known about her), whom he raised and taught, would also be successful as a poet in the vein of Teika (who would seek out her advice after Shunzei died).  Biography  Fujiwara no Shunzei was born in 1114. He was a descendant of the great statesman Fujiwara no Michinaga and son of of the so-called of the Fujiwara clan. His father died when he was ten years old and he was adopted by . As Akiyori's adopted son, he took the name Akihiro (È°ïÂ∫É), but in 1167, when he was 53, he returned to the house he had been born into and took the name Toshinari. (Shunzei is the Sino-Japanese reading for the same characters used to write Toshinari.) At court, he attained to the post of K≈çtai G≈çg≈´-daibu (ÁöáÂ§™ÂêéÂÆÆÂ§ßÂ§´) and held the Senior Third Rank (non-counsellor ÈùûÂèÇË≠∞). In 1176, when he was 62, he took the tonsure and adopted the dharma name of Shakuagaku (ÈáàÈòøË¶ö) or Shakua (ÈáàÈòø). Shunzei died on December 22, 1204 at age 90.

In 2019, AK Steel was named GM Supplier of the Year for Non Fabricated Steel by General Motors for the second consecutive year. AK Steel was also presented with a Smart Pillar Award from Ford, as a top-performing global supplier at the 21st annual Ford World Excellence Awards. History The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility. In 1922, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky. In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco. In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985. In 1982, a recession threatened the U.S. steel industry. Several of the nation‚Äôs steel companies reported losses for the first half of the year, while other companies, like Armco, were barely breaking even. In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company. While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers. In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki. The same year, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown. In March 1994, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load. In 1995, the company moved its headquarters back to Middletown. In 1996, Graham made the decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana. Rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ih 1996 as well. In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion. There was a lock-out at the Mansfield, Ohio plant after a disagreement on a three-year labor contract with 620 USWA employees. In 2003, the bitter labor dispute in Mansfield ended, the union workers returning to work alongside those who'd replaced them. In 2006, there was another lockout of 2,700 workers in Middletown, Ohio about another contract renewal. In 2007, the company moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. In 2014, the company acquired steel-making assets, including a coke- making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products in Dearborn, Michigan, from Severstal for $700 million. In August 2017, the company acquired Precision Partners Holding Company for $360 million. On March 13, 2020, the company was acquired by Cleveland-Cliffs for $1.1 billion. =Inclusion in the S&P; 500 Index (2008-2011)= In 2008, the company was added to the S&P; 500 Index. In 2011, it was removed from the S&P; 500 index and added to the S&P; 600 Index. =In popular culture= The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility. Legal record =Environmental record= On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium. The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million. In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12‚Äì13 million. AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways. Based on 2014 data, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population. In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel. In 2018, AK Steel had an air and water compliance rate of over 99.99%. =Middletown Works lockout= Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a \\"minimum base force guarantee\\". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.\\"Settlement Agreement\\" . - International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio. By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers. In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1. One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union. The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007. As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the \\"minimum base force guarantees\\") were completely terminated. This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue. =Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit= In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that it was being replaced by Ryder as of January 18, 2017. At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings.

The regiment would see action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Monmouth. The regiment was merged into the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment on July 1, 1778.Trussell, John B. B. The Pennsylvania Line: Regimental Organization and Operations, 1776-1783, pp. 164-188. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1977. History The 13th Pennsylvania Regiment of the Continental Army had its beginnings in the Pennsylvania State Regiment, which was formed via the merging of the Pennsylvania State Battalion of Musketry and the Pennsylvania State Rifle Regiment (also known as \\"Miles's Regiment\\"), which had been \\"formed for the defense of Pennsylvania proper,\\" according to historian John B. B. Trussell. The latter of those two regiments had been named after Samuel Miles, who had been appointed as its commanding officer on March 3, 1776.Trussell, The Pennsylvania Line, pp. 164-165. According to Trussell, on \\"October 5, 1776, the Pennsylvania Council of Safety took the first step toward consolidating the remnants of Miles's Regiment and Atlee's Battalion by asking Lieutenant Colonel Brodhead to supply lists of those of his officers who desired to join the Continental Army and those who wanted to remain in the service of the State.\\" The Pennsylvania Council of Safety then announced (on October 25) which companies of the battalion and regiment would make up a new regiment, the Pennsylvania State Regiment. Composed of eight musketry and two rifle units, that regiment was initially commanded by Colonel John Bull until protests by members of their regiment forced state leaders to replace him with Colonel Walter Stewart. Following the addition of an eleventh company \\"to guard powder mills,\\" the regiment's transfer to the Continental Army was finalized on June 10, 1777. Before a month had passed, the regiment was being referred to as the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment.Trussell, The Pennsylvania Line, pp. 169-173. Notable members Samuel Miles was the regiment's commanding officer when he was captured at the Battle of Long Island. On 17 June 1777, Walter Stewart became the unit's commander and led it at the Battle of Brandywine where it fought with George Weedon's 2nd Virginia Brigade. Muncy resident John Robb (c.1733‚Äì1804), who had been appointed second lieutenant in Miles's regiment in March 1776, was commissioned as a captain in the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment on April 18, 1777. John George Hoffner (1735‚Äì1799), who had joined Miles's regiment as a sergeant in May 1776 and had been promoted to ensign the following fall, was appointed first lieutenant with the 13th Pennsylvania in March 1777, and then commissioned as a captain at the end of that same year. Sunbury resident Jacob Snider (c.1755‚Äì1791), was appointed as a sergeant in Miles's regiment in March 1776 and then later made an ensign before becoming a captain in the 13th Pennsylvania on April 18, 1777.\\"To George Washington from the Pennsylvania Council of Safety, 8 February 1777,\\" Founders Online, National Archives, version of January 18, 2019, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-08-02-0295.

He also raided fellow Second Division teams, bringing in wingers Billy Charlton from South Shields and Dick Richards from Wolverhampton Wanderers. A disastrous start to their Division Two campaign saw West Ham win just three, and lose seven of their opening 15 fixtures. West Ham suffered their two biggest defeats of the season in consecutive away games. They lost to Blackpool 4-1 in the meeting on 21 October 1922 and a week later to Leeds United 3-1. Billy Moore scored the only West Ham goals in both games. 11 November 1922 saw West Ham face Leeds United at home and they managed to keep a clean sheet, the game ending 0-0. This game was the start of a 32-game league and cup run that would see West Ham lose only once, in their home game against Manchester United on Boxing Day. West Ham's biggest win of the season came away to Leicester City on 15 February 1923 with the Hammers securing an emphatic 6-0 win. Billy Moore scored a hat-trick, with the other goals coming from Dick Richards, Jimmy Ruffell and Jack Tresadern. The first fruits of this long run of good form was West Ham's presence in their first major cup final. In the first ever FA Cup Final to be held at the newly built Wembley Stadium, it is thought that a quarter of a million people converged on a ground that had the capacity for half of that, to see West Ham play Bolton Wanderers. The match, that became known as the White Horse Final, kicked off 45 minutes late with thousands of fans standing on the touchlines. West Ham were 1-0 down within six minutes. Jack Tresadern entered the crowd to retrieve the ball and before he could return to the pitch Bolton had profited from the numerical advantage and taken the lead, with a header from David Jack. After a half-time break which had seen the players remain on the pitch, West Ham's only chance of the game came as Dick Richards swung a chest-high cross from the right wing for Vic Watson who had his shot saved and held by Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym. Soon after, Bolton secured their victory with a goal from John Smith. There were so many bodies pressing up behind the goal that the ball instantly rebounded out and many had mistakenly thought that the ball had just hit a post. All subsequent FA Cup Finals were all-ticket. Two days after the cup final, West Ham put their disappointment aside and travelled north to face Sheffield Wednesday. West Ham earned what was considered a \\"brave\\" 2-0 win. This put them back on top of Division Two on goal difference, with only one game left to play. West Ham's final day 1-0 loss to eventual champions Notts County was irrelevant, as fellow challengers Leicester City fell at the last hurdle, losing to Bury. \\"The news of Leicester's loss was signalled from the veranda of the director's pavilion whilst a fierce struggle was going on around the Notts goal. Immediately there was a cheer, which swelled into a mighty roar as it was taken up by the crowd all around the ground. For the moment the players were confounded and the play seemed to hang in suspense, but immediately the loss of enthusiasm became apparent - it was a thrilling scene. An interesting touch was added when Donald Cock, the Notts County centre, found the opportunity on the field to shake hands with George Kay, the West Ham captain.\\" - 'Corinthian', The Daily Graphic Both clubs had ensured promotion, and West Ham would be appearing in the First Division for the first time in their history. Vic Watson finished the season as top scorer with 27 goals in league and cup games. Billy Moore was the only ever-present player, finishing the season with 51 appearances.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 11, 1998. Homer and Bart start working at a carnival and befriend a father and son duo named Cooder and Spud. It was written by John Swartzwelder, directed by Mark Kirkland and guest stars Jim Varney as Cooder the carny. The episode contains several cultural references and received a generally mixed critical reception. Plot When Marge unsuccessfully tries to get the kids to clean up the backyard, Homer runs into the house to exclaim to the family that the carnival is in town. After trying some rides, Bart gets himself into trouble by crashing a display of Hitler's limousine into a tree. To repay the loss, Bart and Homer become carnies. They meet up with carnies Cooder and his son, Spud. Cooder asks Homer to run his fixed game, but Homer fails to bribe Chief Wiggum, and Cooder's game is shut down. Feeling guilty, Homer invites Cooder and Spud to stay at the Simpson residence, much to Marge's dismay. To express their gratitude, the Cooders give the Simpsons tickets on a glass-bottom boat ride. When the Simpsons return, they find that the locks have been changed, the windows are all boarded up, and the Simpsons' name is crossed off the mailbox and replaced by \\"The Cooders\\". The family is forced to take up residence in Bart's treehouse. Homer proposes to Cooder, that if he can throw a hula hoop onto the chimney, they get their house back. If he misses, he will sign the deed over to Cooder. Cooder agrees and steps onto the lawn to watch Homer's attempt. Homer stretches and warms up, as if about to throw, but instead he and his family suddenly rush into the house, leaving Cooder and Spud dumbfounded. Production The Big E Fair was the inspiration for this episode. The carnival in this episode is based on The Eastern States Exposition (currently known as The Big E) fair. As a child, Mike Scully went to the fair, and had hoped one day to be a carny. This is the only episode that Mark Kirkland did not tell his parents to watch. This is due to Bart's line \\"Out of my way, I'm Hitler\\". Kirkland's stepfather was a lieutenant in World War II and was injured while in combat. Cooder was modeled after David Mirkin, the showrunner of seasons five and six and co-writer and the executive producer of two episodes in the ninth season. Spud's head shape is modeled after Bart's head. The \\"fisheye effect\\", when Cooder is looking through the peep hole, was drawn by hand, not optically, by assistant director Matthew Nastuk. Matt Groening said they had several endings worked out, including one where Homer made the hula hoop over the chimney. Cultural references When Homer and Bart talk through their teeth while holding the chickens, it is a reference to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby films. Some of the prizes for the ring toss game are a Def Leppard mirror, a Rubik's Cube, and a Magic 8-Ball.. The song being played at the end when Homer fixes his \\"ass groove\\" is \\"Groove Me\\" by King Floyd. The episode makes two references to a past Simpsons episode, \\"The Old Man and the Lisa.\\" Marge advises Homer not ride the Tooth Chipper roller coaster because of his quadruple bypass. During the family's glass- bottom boat ride, a barrel of Li'l Lisa's Patented Animal Slurry is visible on the sea floor. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Bart Carny\\" finished 13th in ratings for the week of January 5‚Äì11, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 11.9, equivalent to approximately 11.7 million viewing households, making it the highest rated episode of Season 9. It was tied with King of the Hill as the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief appearance of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode seems to be saying that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time.\\" Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as \\"brilliant\\", and highlighted it along with episodes \\"The Trouble with Trillions\\" and \\"The Joy of Sect\\" and it has been described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as \\"criminally underrated\\".

History The school was founded in 1857 as the Primary Department of the Florida Institute, and from 1954 until 2001, was located on the FSU campus. However, the university's interest in building a medical school at Florida High's location necessitated the school moving off campus. In 2001, the new Florida High building in Southwood was opened. Relationship with FSU FSUS is sponsored by Florida State University and is a demonstration school for the FSU College of Education, which is used for exploring teaching techniques as well as being an education center where teachers may observe and participate in best teacher practices; and a vehicle for the dissemination of research findings. FSUS and the FSU College of Education collaborate for research, observations, etc. as well as Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College, and Florida A&M; University. After the school's relocation to Southwood, there was some consideration of the school severing its ties with the university. However, that proposal was rejected by Florida High's faculty. Student body Florida High has approximately 1700 students that represent Florida's population demographics. The school has programs in the academics, as well as art, foreign language, and athletic programs. Sports In the spring of 2007, Florida High's girls basketball team defeated Parkway High School to win the 3A State Championship.

They have a relatively large head with big mouth, and they are ambush predators able to consume large prey, including lizards, other frogs, and small mammals. They inhabit arid areas and are seasonal breeders, depositing many small eggs in aquatic habitats. Tadpoles are free-living and carnivorous (Ceratophrys and Lepidobatrachus) or grazers (Chacophrys). Some species (especially from the genera Ceratophrys and Lepidobatrachus) are popular in herpetoculture. Taxonomy Placement of this clade has varied considerably over time, having been a subfamily within the Leptodactylidae for a long while. Later on, it has been raised to family level, either broadly defined, including the Telmatobiidae and Batrachylidae (as subfamilies Telmatobiinae and Batrachylinae, respectively), or as now is commonly accepted, as a smaller family with three genera. Genera The extant genera are: * Ceratophrys Wied-Neuwied, 1824 (8 species) * Chacophrys Reig & Limeses, 1963 (monotypic: Chacophrys pierottii (Vellard, 1948)) * Lepidobatrachus Budgett, 1899 (3 species) In addition, a number of fossil taxa are included in this family, at least provisionally: * ‚Ä†Baurubatrachus B√°ez & Peri, 1990 \\"1989\\" * ‚Ä†Beelzebufo Evans, Jones, & Krause, 2008 * ‚Ä†Wawelia Casamiquela, 1959 References Category:Amphibian families Category:Frogs by classification Category:Turonian first appearances Category:Extant Late Cretaceous first appearances Category:Taxa named by Johann Jakob von Tschudi ","title":"Ceratophryidae"},{"id":"3640338","text":"The Transglobal Secure Collaboration Participation, Inc.

Life George was the eldest son of Simon I of Kartli and his wife, Nestan-Darejan of Kakheti. George fought alongside his father against the Ottoman occupation forces since 1598. He held power after Simon was taken captive by the Turks at the Battle of Nakhiduri in 1599. George attempted several times, though vainly, to ransom his father (who would die as a prisoner in 1612) from captivity and even offered to the Sublime Porte his son as hostage. He soon returned to his struggle against the Ottomans and recovered Lorri in 1601. In 1602, when the Safavid shah of Persia Abbas I resumed a war against the Ottomans, George sided with the Persians and led the Georgian auxiliary troops which took part in the conquest of Erivan in 1603/1604. As a reward, Abbas I granted Giorgi X a minor possession in Iran. In exchange, the shah asked for an area in the Debed River valley in the strategic Lorri district. Abbas I populated this territory with members of the Turkmen tribe Borchali. Finally, the Shah permitted Giorgi X to return to Kartli. He was the first king of Kartli who attempted to establish diplomatic ties with the northern co-religionist power of Muscovy. George decided even to give his daughter Elene to the Czar Boris Godunov in marriage. However, unstable political situation in both countries terminated these contacts. According to Georgian chronicles, George X died suddenly, from a sting on his tongue, after biting into a cake with a bee in it, at Mejvriskhevi, 1606. There have also been some speculations that the king was poisoned on the orders of the shah Abbas I. He was buried at Mtskheta. Family George married on September 15, 1578, Mariam (Tamar) (died c. 1614), daughter of Giorgi I Lipartiani, of the Dadiani dynasty. Their children were: #Luarsab II, King of Kartli. #David (born c. 1595), who disappeared while on a mission to rescue Simon I from the Turkish captivity. #Elene, affianced to Feodor II of Russia. #Khorashan (died 1658), second wife of Teimuraz I of Kakheti. #Tinatin (Lela; known as Fatma Sultan Begum and possibly as Gulchara in Iran) was given in marriage in 1604 to Shah Abbas I, who divorced her after the execution of her brother Luarsab II and married her of to Paykar KhƒÅn Igƒ´rmƒ´ D≈´rt, Khan of Barda and governor of Kakheti (1620‚Äì1625).

It was organized in the spring at Baltimore, Maryland (three companies) and Annapolis, Maryland (six companies) under the command of Colonel William Smallwood consisting of eight companies and one light infantry company from the northern and western counties of the colony of Maryland. History 4 Companies of the alt=A wooden house, or possibly a mill, is surrounded by battle. The smoke and haze of battle obscures much of the background, but formations of red-coated soldiers are visible through it. Small figures, some clearly uniformed, others not obviously so, fight in the foreground. On 6 July 1776, the Maryland Battalion was assigned to the main Continental Army. On 12 August 1776, it was assigned to Stirling's Brigade and five days later (17 August 1776) adopted into the main Continental Army. On 31 August, the Maryland Battalion was reassigned from Stirling's Brigade to McDougall's Brigade. On 19 September 1776 the Maryland Independent Companies were assigned to the Maryland Battalion. This element was relieved from McDougall's Brigade on 10 November 1776. From 10 December 1776 to January 1777, the element was assigned to Mercer's Brigade. In January 1777 this element was re-organized to eight companies and was re-designated as the 1st Maryland Regiment and assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade on 22 May 1777 of the main continental Army. On 12 May 1779, the regiment was re-organized to nine companies. On 5 April 1780, the 1st Maryland Brigade was reassigned to the Southern Department. On 1 January 1781, it was reassigned to the Maryland Brigade of the Southern Department. The regiment would see action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. The regiment was furloughed 27 July 1783 at Baltimore and disbanded on 15 November 1783. The Maryland Battalion distinguished itself at the Battle of Long Island by single-handedly covering the retreat of the American forces against numerically superior British and Hessian forces, with a group of men memorialized as the Maryland 400. Thereafter, General George Washington relied heavily upon the Marylanders as one of the few reliable fighting units in the early Continental Army. For this reason, Maryland is sometimes known as \\"The Old Line State.\\" The lineage of this unit is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard. Battle of Brooklyn The Maryland Regiment had joined the Continental Army barely two weeks before the Battle of Long Island. Unlike most of Washington's Army, the Maryland contingent had been well drilled at home and were so well equipped ‚Äì they even had bayonets, a rarity for the Army ‚Äì that the Regiment was known at home as the Dandy Fifth, and to the rest of the Army as \\"macaronis\\", the then current word for dandies. The Marylanders were put under Lord Stirling's brigade. When the British under Cornwallis surprised the Americans by circling around their rear, Stirling ordered all forces, other than the Marylanders, who were outside the fortified position on Brooklyn Heights to retreat there leaving behind himself and 4 companies of the 1st Maryland. Stirling led these men (who would come to be known as \\"The Maryland 400\\") against Cornwallis' 2,000 British soldiers who were massed around the Old Stone House, a thick-walled fieldstone and brick fortification near today's Fifth Avenue and 3rd Street that had been built in 1699 to withstand Indian raids. In fierce fighting, the Marylanders charged the British forces six times to give their comrades time to make their way to safety with the rest of Washington's army in the Heights. Twice they managed to drive the British from the house, but as more British reinforcements arrived and the Marylanders casualties mounted, they finally had to give up the assault and try to get to safety themselves. Only Major Mordecai Gist and nine others managed to reach the American lines. Of the others, 256 lay dead in front of the Old Stone House and more than 100 were wounded/and or captured. The bravery of the Maryland Regiment earned them the name \\"immortals\\". The dead were buried in a mass grave consisting of six trenches in a farm field. The gravesite is located on what is now Third Avenue between 7th and 8th Streets. Until the widening of Third Avenue in 1910, the site was marked by a tablet that read: \\"Burial place of ye 256 Maryland soldiers who fell in ye combat at ye Cortelyou House on ye 27th day of August 1776.\\" The result of the brief battle was stunning for the Americans. More than a thousand men were killed, captured, or missing. Generals Stirling and Sullivan were in the enemy's hands. The battalion had lost more than 250 of their number. Most of the Marylanders' casualties occurred in the retreat and desperate covering action at the Cortelyou House. Ultimately, of the original Maryland 400 muster, 96 returned, with only 35 fit for duty. Historian, Thomas Field, writing in 1869, \\"The Battle of Long Island,\\" called the stand of the Marylanders \\"an hour more precious to liberty than any other in history.\\" Four companies of the 1st Maryland stood as the final anchor of the crumbled American front line, and their heroic action not only saved many of their fellows but afforded Washington critical respite to regroup and withdraw his battered troops to Manhattan and continue the struggle for independence. Over time, the farm became the site of a Red Devil paint factory, and the burial grounds became part of a factory courtyard open to the sky because of a deed restriction relating to the grave. More time passed. The paint factory gave way to an auto repair shop and the courtyard was roofed over. Today the heroes whom Washington himself lamented lie under the floor of the building that had housed the auto repair shop. They lie in their unmarked grave miles from a Stanford White monument to their sacrifice in the form of a marble shaft topped with a sphere that stands at the foot of Lookout Hill in Prospect Park. It was erected in 1895 as a gift of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. The Old Stone House survived the battle and in later years became the first clubhouse of the baseball team that came to be known as the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was destroyed in the 1890s, and rebuilt in the 1930s.* Battle of Cowpens When Major General Nathanael Greene took command of the Southern theater of the war, his army numbered 1482 men present. Only 949 were Continental regulars, most of whom were in the \\"Maryland Line\\" regiment. Three companies of the Marylanders were in Lt. Col. John Eager Howard's battalion. They participated extensively at Cowpens.

She was named People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1970. Biography Ekaterina Zelyonaya was born in Tashkent (modern-day Uzbekistan) into a Russian family of modest means, the third of four children. Her rare surname which translates from Russian as Green had been often taken for a pseudonym by people, just like her stage name Rina (short for Ekaterina). Her paternal grandfather Ivan Kuzmich Zelyoniy was a member of the Tashkent City Duma. According to the actress, her parents didn't fit each other at all.Rina Zelyonaya (2018). Scattered Pages. ‚Äî Moscow: AST, 448 pages (Memoirs) Her mother Nadezhda Fyodorovna Zelyonaya was given away to marriage at the age 16. She was absolutely careless and couldn't plan family budget which led to grand scandals involving her husband ‚Äì Vasily Ivanovich Zelyoniy, a low-ranking official, a stingy and generally unsympathetic man, as Rina described him. After he was transferred to Moscow, Rina entered a prestigious gymnasium for girls despite the lack of money. During the October Revolution she entered the Moscow Theatre School where she studied for two years. Among her teachers were Maria Blumenthal-Tamarina, Illarion Pevtsov and Nikolai Radin. Hunger and the lack of job made her seek other options. By that time her father had been assigned with restoration of storage facilities in Odessa. Rina along with her mother and younger sister decided to join him and traveled to Odessa, but it turned out Vasily Zelyoniy had left the family for another woman. Early popularity Rina got sick with typhus along the way and as soon as she recovered, she joined the Odessa KROT theatre led by Viktor Tipot and Vera Inber, and that's where her career really started. After awhile she returned to Moscow, performed in night cabarets with songs and musical numbers, and in 1924 became an actress of the Moscow Satire Theatre. From 1930 on she started performing with stand-up shows. She became popular on account of her ability to imitate the speech of children. Although she appeared briefly in such well-known films as The Foundling (1939), for which she also co-wrote the script, Zelyonaya earned her living by touring the country and performing humorous skits from the life of children. She also provided the voice for cartoon characters and radio shows. During the Great Patriotic War she visited the frontline and performed for soldiers, for which she was awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1944. Later life At an advanced age, she was cast in film roles of grannies, notably as Mrs. Hudson in the TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson filmed by the Lenfilm movie studio between 1979 and 1986.

They first started as Egyptian Gypsies, then the Ghawzis extensively practiced and developed among rural Egyptians or Fellahin, who then developed a more rural and traditional style accompanied by Rural Egyptian songs and colorful dresses of the Fellahin and became a theme of Rural Egypt. Over the years, Upper Egyptians (Sa'idis) mastered and then developed a different style of traditional Saidi dancing that's accompanied by Egyptian mizmar flute and Qena and Assuit's traditional female clothing of Telli () , a super silky type of local fabric. That Upper Egyptian style is the most famous. The Ghawazee dancers are some of the indigenous professional dancers of Egypt. These traditional entertainers are becoming harder and harder to find as time passes. There are main movements and positioning of two of the most popular Ghawazee groups that are found in Modern Egypt; the Banat Mazin () of Luxor and the Sumbati Ghawazee () of the Nile Delta. Banat Mazin are famous for their traditional Upper Egyptian vintage-style costume, so you can see how the movements would be affected by the costuming. The Sagat (finger cymbals), are optional but recommended in the Upper Egyptian/Saidi style. While the performative and traditional raqs sharqi in urban Egypt was more classical and influenced by more formal and classical Western styles such as classical ballet or Latin American dance, the term ghawazi in Egypt refers to the dancers in rural Egypt who have preserved the traditional 18th- to 19th-century style. Name Postcard photograph of two ghawazi posing in dance costume with the name of \\"Egyptian types and scenes (c. 1900). The Arabic ghawƒÅzƒ´ (singular ghƒÅziya) means \\"conqueror\\", as the ghaziya is said to \\"conquer\\" the hearts of her audience. They were also known as awƒÅlim (singular alma, transliterated almeh in French as alm√©e), but in Egypt, Awalim are the traditional Egyptian dancers and singers of the city, not rural areas, who used to perform in respectable events such as the weddings and festivities of notable people. Both terms are 19th-century euphemisms for \\"erotic dancer\\"; almeh literally means \\"learned woman\\" and came to be used as a replacement for ghaziya after the ghawazi were legally banned in 1834. An almeh originally was a courtesan in Egyptian culture, a woman educated to sing and recite classical poetry and to discourse. After the ghawazi were banned, they were forced to pretend that they were in fact awalim. The term almeh was introduced in French Orientalism as alm√©e and used synonymously with \\"belly dancer\\". History Depiction of a ghaziya by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (L'Alm√©e, 1863). In 1834, the ghawazi were banished from Cairo to Upper Egypt by Muhammad Ali. Initially, the Ghawazi were a very small group who got banished because of their low- class dancing. By time the term then didn't refer to them but mainly became a general term for any dancers as it included all the traditional and folk dances of Rural and Upper Egyptians, mainly featuring mizmars and heavy bass lines and other traditional Egyptian music in the background.William H. Peck, The Dancer of Esna (2003) Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, descriptions and depictions of ghawazi dancers became famous in European Orientalism, and the style was described as danse de ventre or belly-dance from the 1860s. A khawal (dancing boy) dressed in ghaziya dancing costume (c. 1870). The first Ghawazis performed unveiled in the streets. Rapid hip movement and use of brass finger cymbals/hand castanets characterized their dance. Musicians of their tribe usually accompanied them in their dance. They usually wore kohl around their eyes and henna on their fingers, palms, toes and feet. According to Lane these women were \\"the most abandoned of the courtesans of Egypt\\". He describes them as being very beautiful and richly dressed. The Ghawazi performed in the court of a house, or in the street, before the door, on certain occasions of festivity in the harem. They were never admitted into a respectable harem, but were frequently hired to entertain a party of men in the house of some rake. Both women and men enjoyed their entertainment. However, many people who were more religious, or of the higher classes, disapproved of them. Many people liked the dancing of the Ghawazi, but felt it was improper because of its being danced by women who should not expose themselves in this manner. Because of this, there was a small number of young male performers called Khawals. The Khawals were Egyptian male traditional dancers who impersonated the women of the Ghawazi and their dance. They were known to impersonate every aspect of the women including their dance and use of castanets. Contemporary practitioners Rotogravure of another depiction of a ghaziya by G√©r√¥me Representing diverse historical backgrounds, most of the Ghawazi of the Qena region belong to ethnic minorities such as the Nawar (or Nawara), Halab and Bahlawen. Particularly well known are the Banat Maazin family, Nawar people that settled in Luxor and were filmed in the 70s and 80s. Many consider the Maazin family to be the only practicing family left of the original line of Ghawazi dancers. Influence on Western belly-dance The style of dance and costuming of the Ghawazi has been especially influential in crafting the look of American Tribal Style Belly Dance. The Gypsy Ghawazi dress consists of an Ottoman coat with slits, known as a Yelek or entari. The abdomen is covered by these coats. Turkish harem pants are worn under these coats. The coats are typically ankle- length, though some modern Ghawazee troupes wear a shorter version over a full, knee-length skirt. Ghawazee dancers often adorn their heads with elaborate headresses, with dancers often accompanying themselves by playing zils, or small cymbals that are used by dancers in many forms of Middle Eastern dance. The Egyptian Ghawazi costumes worn by rural and upper Egyptians are more rich in colors. In Rural Egypt, the traditional female dancing dress is floral and fluffy; the dancers typically choose different colors, each dancer usually wearing a different color from the one next to her. In the Upper Egyptian style, the dancers wear the popular Saidi Telli dress, a black and glittery traditional Egyptian dress. The main dancers are accompanied by Saidi music, mainly the Egyptian flute and traditional Saidi songs narrating stories about the beauty of Qena, Assuit, Minya and their traditions.

The novel won the 1998 Sapphire Award for Best Science Fiction Romance and the UTC Readers Choice Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.Interview in Locus Magazine Plot overview The first half of Catch the Lightning takes place in an alternate Los Angeles on Earth in a time similar to the late 20th century. The main character is Tina Pulivok, a seventeen-year-old Maya girl living in East L.A. She has relocated to Los Angeles and is living on her own while she works as a waitress. The hero, Althor Selei, a cybernetically enhanced Jag fighter pilot, is thrown into the alternate universe when his star fighter malfunctions. Tina meets Althor late at night when she is returning home from work, and he is trying to figure out why he ended up on a planet that bears little resemblance to the Earth he expected. After Althor helps Tina escape an incident of gang violence, the two become fugitives. Tina is an empath. She is aware she is different but has no name for her abilities and is afraid to tell anyone about what she experiences. Althor is a member of the Ruby Dynasty, and as such he is heir to the throne of an interstellar empire called the Skolian Imperialate. He is also a Rhon psion and can read moods, sometimes even thoughts, from other people. He and Tina share an immediate attraction, in part based on their abilities. During the night, while Althor stays with Tina, the Air Force discovers his Jag star ship and takes it to a military installation. Specialists there examine it, unaware that a technology-induced telepathic link ties the ship to the Jagernaut mind of its unknown (to them) pilot. As a result, they have no idea their tests are killing Althor. With the aid of several Caltech students Tina knows, she and Althor infiltrate the military complex and regain the ship. As soon as Althor repairs its damaged systems, he and Tina return to his spacetime. They are almost immediately captured by the group that sabotaged Althor's ship, after which they are sold as slaves to his enemies, in particular an Aristo named Kryx Iquar. Althor is stunned to learn that the person who betrayed him was his close personal friend, Ragnar Bloodmark, an influential Skolian admiral who helped raise him. After being held captive and tortured for several days, Althor and Tina escape with the help of his sentient Jag fighter. In the end, Tina marries Althor, and together they discover the origin of Althor's ancestors, the Raylicans, who were a displaced group of Maya from Earth, relocated to the planet Raylicon during an earlier era by unknown aliens. Context Although Catch the Lightning is chronologically the last book in the series (to date), the novel was the second of Asaro's fourteen books published in The Saga of the Skolian Empire and is considered a stand-alone work. The events take place fifty years after the Radiance War, as described in The Radiant Seas.Crescent Blues Interview. The book is known for breaking the expectation of young adult science fiction at the time, a genre which prior to that time primarily focused on young male protagonists. In showcasing instead a young female protagonist with a romantic story line, Catch the Lightning helped open the genre to a new audience of readers. Other examples of such novels include Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders series and the work of Lois McMaster Bujold.Scalzi nomination for Romantic Times Asaro uses the two-part structure of the novel to explore the clash between different cultures, a theme inherent to the genre of planetary romance as done by authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Marion Zimmer Bradley. The main character, Tina Pulivok, is a young woman of the Tzotzil Maya from the Zinacantan village of Nabenchauk on the Chiapas plateau in southern Mexico.

In the second half of the novel, when Tina travels to Althor's universe and time, the differences in their backgrounds become more pronounced, and the resolution of those differences within the context of the adventure forms a prominent theme of the novel. By using alien settings to consider what it means to be different, Asaro looks at conflicts inherent in different cultures and peoples on our own world.Strange Horizons review by Alex Hartman.

Raylicon and origins of the saga Catch the Lightning is the Skolian book that most features the world Raylicon, ancient home of the \\"lost children,\\" those humans taken from Earth thousands of years ago and stranded on Raylicon. The mystery of why a starfaring species moved humans to a dying world and then disappeared, leaving nothing behind but the wreckage of starships, is a central question of the saga. The displaced humans eventually conquer space flight and raise the interstellar Ruby Empire. Built with only partially understood technology, it falls three centuries later, and it takes another four thousand years for the Raylicans to regain the stars. (The Radiant Seas, 1999) During that time, the colonies on other worlds are stranded, and those that survive lose their technology, becoming lost worlds. Raylicon is the culture that survives, and in modern times the mysterious ruins of the Ruby Empire exist side by side with the modern cities of the Skolian Imperialate. The chapters set on Raylicon, which come late in the book, offer the most detail in the saga about the culture and history of world that originated both the Skolians and their enemies, the Eubian Concord, aka the Trader Empire.

It tells the story of Dyhianna Selei (Dehya), the Ruby Pharaoh of the Skolian Imperialate, as she strives to reform her government and reunite her family in the aftermath of a devastating interstellar war.  Plot summary  Spherical Harmonic is a first person narrative told from the viewpoint of Dyhianna Selei. Although an elected Assembly governs the Imperialate, in ages past the Ruby Pharaoh ruled as absolute sovereign. Selei is the descendant of the ancient pharaohs, and is considered the titular ruler of modern Skolia. Spherical Harmonic takes place following the Radiance War, a conflict fought between the Imperialate and the Eubian Concord, an empire ruled by a rigid caste of narcissists called Aristos. The Eubian economy is based on slave trade, which the Aristos seek to expand to the Imperialate. Just prior to the opening scene of Spherical Harmonic, Dyhianna Selei escapes a Eubian military force by stepping into a Lock, a singularity that defines the boundary between two universes. In mathematical terms, she has entered an alternate dimension defined by the functions known as spherical harmonics. As the book opens, she is \\"coalescing\\" on a moon called Opalite. She reforms in partial waves that transfer her from one universe to the other. Some prose in the book is written in the shape of the sinusoidal functions found in the spherical harmonics.Text with sinusoidal prose poemsAsaro describes the mathematics of spherical harmonics in an essay at the end of the novel. As Selei fades in and out of existence, in danger of disappearing, she slowly recovers her memories about her identity and history. She manages to activate an emergency protocol secretly established on the moon for her protection. As a result she is found by Jon Casestar, an admiral in the Skolian Fleet, and Commander Vaz Majda, an elite fighter pilot who is also her sister-in-law. Once aboard an ISC battle cruiser, Selei strives to reunite the Ruby Dynasty and find out what has happened to her people. The book follows her attempts to resurrect the Skolian military and government.Review by Science Fiction critic Cynthia Ward Selei also struggles to discover what has happened to her son Taquinil and her husband Eldrinson. Her plan to go to Earth and free members of the Ruby Dynasty being held captive there, including Roca, her sister and heir, meets little enthusiasm among her top officers, as it can be seen as an act of war. Unable to trust anyone, Selei ends up seeking to overthrow the elected government of her own empire so she can rebuild it from the ashes of the war.  Context  In one sense, Spherical Harmonic is a space adventure about the recovery of a civilization from a war that had no winner. On another level, it is about the emotional toll that war exacts on those who survive it, a theme Asaro often explores in the Saga of the Skolian Empire, as exemplified by the subplot in Spherical Harmonic involving the attempts of Selei and her husband to come to terms with his shattering experiences during the war. Both acclaimed and criticized for the complexity of her plotting, world building, and character development, Asaro focuses as much on the human condition as the adventure aspects of the story.Publisher's Weekly Nov 12, 2001Library Journal 2001Review by Diana Tixier Herald in Booklist 2001, American Library Association (the Publisher's Weekly, Library Journal, and Booklist reviews are also available online at Amazon) Asaro is also known for the use of mathematics in her novels. Spherical Harmonic involves an imagined universe based on the Hilbert space described by the angular wave functions that solve the Laplace Equation. The spherical harmonics are an orthonormal set of eigenfunctions used in many areas of math and physics, including quantum mechanics and electromagnetics. A theoretical physicist by training, Asaro uses the concepts of the Hilbert space described by the harmonics to create the universe called Kyle space.Article about Asaro's work at Physics Central, an online publication of the American Physical Society. By directly applying the rules that define Hilbert spaces, the author invents a universe where \\"location\\" is based on quantum wave functions rather than position and time, and where a psion's thoughts determined their location in Kyle space. As described in an essay at the end of the book, the properties of that universe and the abstract forms of human interaction there are fictional extrapolations of the mathematical theory. The novel Spherical Harmonic overlaps with Ascendant Sun which tells the events after the Radiance War from the point of view of new Skolian Imperator Kelric. It also overlaps with the book The Moon's Shadow which centers on Eubian Emperor Jaibriol III and his efforts to initiate peace talks with Skolians after the war.

In some cases of blind loop syndrome, overgrowth of pathogenic non-commensal bacteria has also been noted. It has long been understood that from birth, and throughout life, large amounts of bacteria reside symbiotically within animal gastrointestinal tracts such as the human gastrointestinal tract. The understanding of this gut flora has even led to novel treatments for bowel irregularity that utilize so called \\"probiotics\\" or good bacteria that aid in normal digestion. The problem of BLS arises when the bacterial colonies residing in the upper gastrointestinal tract begin to grow out of control or are altered in their makeup thereby creating a burden on the normal physiological processes occurring in the small intestine. This results in problems, among others, of: vitamin B12 deficiency, fat malabsorption and steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and intestinal wall injury. Symptoms and signs Most of the symptoms of BLS are non specific but nevertheless warrant the utmost attention. These include: * Loss of appetite * Nausea * Flatulence * Diarrhea * Fullness after a meal * Fatty stools (steatorrhea) * Unintentional weight loss * Generalised weakness As a result of the concomitant vitamin and mineral deficiencies that occur as a result of the malabsorption associated with BLS patients with advanced cases should be investigated for: * Vitamin B12 deficiency * Folate deficiency * Iron deficiency * Vitamin E deficiency Causes Blind loop syndrome is a complication of surgical operations of the abdomen, as well as inflammatory bowel disease or scleroderma. Another cause is jejunoileal diverticula.Sabiston textbook of surgery board review, 7th edition. Chapter 42 small intestine, question 14 Pathophysiology The overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine is prevented by various mechanical and chemical factors which include the constant peristaltic movement of contents along the length of the gastrointestinal tract and the antibacterial properties of gastric secretions, pancreatic secretions and bile. It follows that a disruption of any of these factors could lead to bacterial overgrowth and indeed BLS has been found to occur in persons with anatomical anomalies that result in stagnation. BLS has also been associated with achlorhydria, dysmotility, fistulae, and strictures. Chronic or high dose opioid therapy may contribute to BLS by reducing gastric motility. Due to the disruption of digestive processes by the overgrowth of intestinal bacteria; malabsorption of bile salts, fat and fat-soluble vitamins, protein and carbohydrates results in damage to the mucosal lining of the intestine by bacteria or via the production of toxic metabolites. Diagnosis A physical examination may reveal a mass or distention of the abdomen.Tests which may be useful for diagnosis include: * Abdominal x-ray * Abdominal CT scan * Contrast enema study Treatment The treatment of BLS follows two basic principles. When a patient presents with symptoms of BLS, the treating physician basically has two recognized options for management: * Test-and-treat * Treat empirically =Test-and-treat method= Although it would seem to be the better way to go in terms of management, there has been recent criticism on the need for such testing because of reliability issues. However, it must be stated that there are options such as the glucose breath test and jejunal aspiration the explanations of which are beyond the scope of this current article. =Treating empirically= The \\"treat empirically\\" route also has its difficulties, which have all come under wide debate and study. Recommendations are varied but seem to find some common ground around the notion that treatment should be individualized to the specific circumstances under which a patient has developed BLS since these circumstances affect the complex microbial make up of the affected bowel.Tetracyclines have been the mainstay of treatment for BLS, but recent studies have concluded Rifaximin to be very effective in the treatment of BLS. One study by Di Stefano et al., however, concluded Metronidazole to be more effective than Rifaximin in the treatment of BLS. =Surgical management= Surgical management is reserved for fixing anatomical causes of bowel obstruction that interfere with normal function once they are amenable to such intervention. These conditions include: * Strictures * Fistulae * Diverticula References  External links  Category:Gastrointestinal tract disorders Category:Syndromes ","title":"Blind loop syndrome"},{"id":"3640447","text":"Draƒç√≠ doupƒõ (literally translated: Dragon's Den) is a popular Czech role- playing game, very loosely based on Dungeons & Dragons. It was created by the publishing company ALTAR.  Rules  Each player plays typically one character (warrior, ranger, wizard etc.), except for one player - the gamemaster (called P√°n jeskynƒõ in Czech, which can be translated literally as Lord of the cavern or more freely as dungeon master). He/she prepares a map and then describes to the players what their characters see and hear. The players say what the characters do and the gamemaster says what was the result of their actions.

Name ‚Äûkud≈Øk‚Äú (in original as Holbytla), written correctly \\"kud√∫k‚Äú, can be found in J.R.R.Tolkien, where it is used in their own language as a label for Hobbits. \\"Kud≈Øk\\"s in DrD were created as interspecies between dwarves and hobbits. *Dwarf *Elf *Human *Barbar ‚Äì humans living in wild far away from civilization. Separation changed them: they are stronger and more resistant, but less agile and charismatic than other humans. *Kroll ‚Äì basic traits are strong muscles, high growth (over 2 m), fierce and warlike character and low intelligence. They have a rough tough grayish skin and its appearance reminiscent of prehistoric man. Striking are the big ears they use in ultrasounds echolocation like bats. Their low intelligence brings up a variety of jokes (some Dungeon Masters determine the number of words, which Kroll knows, etc.)  Profession  Each player chooses one of five professions. On a higher level every character has to choose one of two possible specializations for his profession. The professions and specializations are:. * Warrior - a strong person with fighting abilities ** Fighter - a powerful hero, strong especially against giant animals ** Fencer - strong against humanoids * Ranger - also strong in battles, but with abilities like healing, speaking to animals, tracing other beings etc. ** Strider - strong in fighting and finding information (inspired by Aragorn) ** Druid - a forest spellcaster * Sorcerer - weakest in fight, but able to cast spells ** Wizard - practical magic of all kinds, inventing new spells ** Mage - mental magic, understanding the \\"fundamental conflict\\" of the world (between good and evil etc.) * Alchemist - able to prepare magical potions, explosives, poisons, enchanted weapons etc. ** Theurg - contact with astral spheres, casting elementals, enchanted weapons etc. ** Pyrofor - magical potions, flying torpedoes, rockets, poisons * Thief - able to move unseen, convince people, climb walls etc. ** Robber - noteless in a crowd, good at knife throwing and martial arts, estimating a value of a jewel etc. ** Sicco - estimating intentions of people, building a \\"net\\" (organized band) References External links *Official site of ALTAR (in Czech) Category:Fantasy role- playing games Category:Czech role-playing games Category:Czech board games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1990 ","title":"Draƒç√≠ doupƒõ"},{"id":"3640449","text":"The Eleutherodactylidae are a family of direct-developing frogs native to northern South America, the Caribbean, and southernmost North America.

As currently defined, the family has more than 200 species (as of 2014, 206 or 207 species). Eleutherodactylid frogs vary considerably in size, from the minuscule Eleutherodactylus iberia (female snout‚Äìvent length ) to the relative giant E. inoptatus (female snout‚Äìvent length ). Except for the ovoviviparous E. jasperi, these frogs have direct development: no free-living tadpole stage exists; instead, eggs develop directly into small froglets.

The original duratrans film was exposed photographically and developed chemically using a similar silver halide process as conventional lab photography. Over time, the phrase duratrans has been genericized to apply to various large format backlit graphic substrates, imaged in a variety of ways including photochemical and various types of inkjets. \\"Promotional\\" duratrans The most common usage of duratrans is for the backlit graphic film used for promotional advertising displays in shopping malls, airports, casinos, movie theaters, restaurants, retail stores, trade show exhibit halls and any retail establishment that contains any number of backlit display lightboxes in which the printed duratrans graphic films must be inserted and illuminated, in order to gain the advantage of their backlightable property. Promotional duratrans are imaged with advertising messages, product and lifestyle photos, informational and/or menu content, and/or virtually any printed content the user desires to display. \\"Fine Art\\" duratrans The distinction between promotional and fine art duratrans is purely in the subject matter of the artwork imaged onto the duratrans film. There is no other defining difference, except that possibly a fine art duratrans may be processed using higher resolutions, color depths, and/or other fabrication tolerances to effect a higher-precision result, for a more-demanding audience. \\"Translite\\" duratrans Another popular application of duratrans is as a photo backdrop in television news sets and theater designs. These duratrans, a.k.a. translites, are most often used to create the backgrounds that appear behind news presenters or anchors. In theatre the backgrounds are positioned behind the actors, actresses, and other talent respectively. Translites can range from 15 to more than 100 feet long and 12 to 40 feet tall. In most cases, translites are wider than they are tall. The translite image is printed or painted on a translucent material such as polyester or a plastic sheet. This is then stretched vertically over an opening in the set's backwall which is designed to support it. Translites are lit from behind using lights mounted perpendicular to the floor in the space between the set and studio wall, illuminating the translite image and adding to the illusion of depth. Translites are created by printing photographic images or computer-rendered images onto the material using large-format printers. Many existing translites have been created in a photographic darkroom by a mural enlarger projecting onto a strip of film up to wide. These pieces are assembled into the final size by seaming. A matte lacquer is often added to dull the finish, to mitigate stage lighting reflections. Translites for television news sets often contain photographs of city skylines, landscapes, the logos for the station and its television network affiliation, control rooms, and abstract designs. Set areas designed for sports and weather portions of the newscasts contain weather, sports, and team logo imagery. Translites for live and cinematic theatrical productions often contain skyline photographs.

Early life  Helen was born in Stenhousemuir, near Falkirk. She attended Larbert Village School, Larbert High School and Falkirk Technical College before going on to read trade union studies at the London School of Economics. Eadie was a member of Fife Regional Council before being elected the Scottish Parliament in 1999. At the 1997 general election, she contexted the Roxburgh and Berwickshire constituency as the Labour candidate. She finished in third place, but increased her party's share of the vote to 15% from 8.8% in 1992.  Member of the Scottish Parliament  When Labour was in power in the Scottish Executive, Eadie called for an end to tolls on the Forth Road Bridge. After the May 2003 Scottish parliament election, Eadie strongly opposed the then Labour‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition's agreed deal to introduce the single transferable vote (STV) proportional system for future local council elections. She said it was an example of \\"the tail wagging the dog\\" and \\"It's about one of the smallest parties in the parliament wanting to use the power that they have to try to force through issues that they want to see steamrollered through.\\" In November 2006, Eadie called for curfews against under-15 youths, after she was surrounded and trapped inside her car by a mob of youngsters who started rocking the car and throwing missiles at it. She was a member of many Scottish Parliament committees, but in June 2007 resigned two of her committee posts in protest at a Tory MSP being given a convener-ship of the equal opportunities committee. Eadie said at the time, the move was like \\"putting Attila the Hun in charge of community care\\". Personal life Eadie was married with two daughters. In 2013, it emerged she was being treated for cancer at the Queen Margaret Hospital, following diagnosis at the end of October. She died on 9 November 2013.

People's Artist of the USSR (1983). Biography Lyudmila Gurchenko was born in Kharkiv, USSR (now Ukraine) in 1935 to Mark Gavrilovich Gurchenko (1898‚Äì1973) and Yelena Aleksandrovna (or Olena Oleksandrivna in Ukrainian) Simonova-Gurchenko (1917‚Äì1999). Before World War II they lived in a single room apartment on the ground floor at Mordvinovsky Lane No. 17 (now Gurchenko Lane #7). At home Gurchenko painted her portrait (photo), SQ (29 August 2016) At that time, her parents worked at the Kharkiv Philharmonic Society. Mark Gurchenko was known to play the bayan (Russian accordion). Gurchenko spent a part of her childhood with her mom during the time of the German occupation of USSR in her native city, while her father joined the army and, together with his concert brigade, survived the war. After the withdrawal of the German Army from Kharkiv, Gurchenko auditioned for the local Beethoven Music School, where she performed the song About Vitya Cherevichkin with gestures, after which she was accepted as an acting student. She moved to Moscow, enrolling in the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. At age 21, after starring in Eldar Ryazanov's 1956 directorial debut, the musical Carnival Night, Gurchenko overnight achieved fame as well as celebrity status. Throughout the next two years she toured the entire country with her Carnival Night-inspired musical numbers, attracting crowds of fans.¬´–ü—Ä–æ—â–∞–π, –ü—Ä–∏–º–∞–¥–æ–Ω–Ω–∞!¬ª –ù–µ–æ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é –õ—é–¥–º–∏–ª—ã –ì—É—Ä—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ The Soviet cultural establishment, however, deemed her style too western and too out of line with Soviet standards. She was accused of receiving wages above State-set levels as compensation for her shows. She became the target of highly critical articles in several influential Soviet periodicals, including Tap Dance to the Left (–ß–µ—á–µ—Ç–∫–∞ –Ω–∞–ª–µ–≤–æ, Komsomolskaya Pravda, 1957, ) and Dositheos Morals (–î–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–µ–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤—ã, Ogoniok, 1958, , devoted to her financial wrongdoing and her alleged lack of patriotism. The year of 1958 saw the release of another musical with Ludmila, Girl with a Guitar, shot mostly before these articles were published. The musical was not recommended for wide distribution and was a box-office flop. In the mid 1970s, Gurchenko starred in several films, which, although only moderately successful, helped showcase her dramatic talent. In 1979 she landed a role in director Andrei Konchalovsky's Siberiade and in 1982 in Station for Two, once again by Eldar Ryazanov, who by then had become one of the USSR's most popular and prolific directors. The role of forty-something waitress Vera in this touching film became her long-awaited comeback as a superstar of Soviet film. Subsequently, she starred in Vladimir Menshov's Love and Pigeons, among many other movies and TV shows. Her multifaceted talent was recognized on many occasions. She received the title of People's Artist of the USSR, the highest honour that could be bestowed to a musical artist, in 1983. She carried a leading role in The Burn (–û–∂–æ–≥ ‚Äì 1988) with Director Gennady Glagoliev and Director of Photography Igor Chepusov.Profile, kinopoisk.ru. Retrieved 6 March 2015. Gurchenko wrote a book about her life during German occupation in Kharkiv and about her life in the beginning of her Acting Career. In 2010, she was awarded an Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", 2nd Class (she received the 4th Class of the same Order in 2000 and the 3d Class in 2005), one of the highest civil decorations in post-Soviet Russia (with 3rd and 2nd Degree Orders having been awarded to very few extremely distinguished individuals, and the 1st Degree Order being nominally held by a serving President of Russia). At the age of 70, she still performed and attended galas. Personal life Gurchenko was married six times, including a short-lived marriage to Joseph Kobzon in 1969.

The regiment was authorized on 16 September 1776 for service with the Continental Army and was assigned on 27 December 1776 to the main element. 1st Maryland Brigade On 22 May 1777 it was assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade. The regiment was re-organized to nine companies on 12 May 1779. On 5 April 1780 the 1st Maryland Brigade was reassigned to the Southern Department. The regiment was relieved from the 1st Maryland Brigade on 1 January 1781. It was assigned to Gist's Brigade on 24 September 1781 in the main Continental Army. Three days later (27 September 1781) Gist's Brigade was reassigned to the Southern Department. On 4 January 1782 the regiment was reassigned from Gist's Brigade to the Maryland Brigade in the Southern Department. The regiment would see action during the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Camden, Battle of Guilford Court House, Battle of Eutaw Springs and the Battle of Yorktown. The regiment disbanded on 1 January 1783 at Charleston, South Carolina. Under Gist's command Gist became colonel in command of the 3rd Maryland on 10 December 1776. On 22 May 1777, George Washington assigned the regiment to the 1st Maryland Brigade together with the 1st Delaware Regiment, and the 1st, 5th, 7th Maryland Regiments. During the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, both the popular brigade commander William Smallwood and Gist were on detached duty recruiting the Maryland militia. This left the disliked Frenchman Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre as the senior brigadier. The regiment was in John Sullivan's division on the right flank, guarding Brinton's Ford while other elements of the division guarded three upstream fords. Finding that the greater part of Sir William Howe's army had marched into the right rear of his division, Sullivan had to march cross country in an attempt to block the move. Finding his division in an awkward position, Sullivan rode off to confer with Adam Stephen and Lord Stirling and ordered De Borre to shift the division to the right. The inept Frenchman botched the evolution, throwing the troops into disorder just as they came under attack by the Brigade of Guards. According to John Hoskins Stone, commander of the 1st Maryland, only his regiment and the 3rd put up a creditable fight. As they tried to resist the oncoming British, the confused 2nd Brigade mistakenly fired a volley into the two regiments from behind. The badly mishandled Marylanders then fled. Gist commanded the 3rd Maryland at the Battle of Germantown. He led the 3rd Maryland until 9 January 1779 when he was promoted brigadier general in command of the 2nd Maryland Brigade. Battle of Monmouth At Monmouth, the regiment was commanded by Colonel Mordecai Gist while its second-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Ramsey. Ramsey was detached to Colonel James Wesson's detachment under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne. Early in the battle, Wesson was wounded and Ramsey assumed command of his detachment.Presumably, part of the regiment was detached with Ramsey, but this is not directly stated by the source. Surprised by a sudden British counterattack, the American advance guard began to retreat. Washington personally asked Ramsey and Colonel Walter Stewart to hold off the British while he arranged the main line of defense. The two officers agreed and Wayne deployed their soldiers in a nearby wood. As the Brigade of Guards came up to their hidden position, the Americans opened fire into their flank. The Guards charged and cleared the wood after a tough fight in which they lost 40 casualties including Colonel Henry Trelawney wounded. Stewart was shot and carried off. The retreating Americans were set upon in the open by a troop of the 16th Light Dragoons. A dragoon rode up to the unhorsed Ramsey and fired at him with his pistol. The weapon misfired and Ramsey attacked the trooper with his sword, dragged him from his horse, and tried to ride away. Surrounded by dragoons, Ramsey was badly wounded and left for dead. Later, the British picked him up as a prisoner. Impressed by his bravery, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton paroled Ramsey the next day. Ramsey was not exchanged until December 1780.

It is the highest point in the South Downs National Park. The pine- and heather-covered slopes are owned by the National Trust and have many paths and organised walks supported by volunteers, the local authorities, charities and guidebooks. The virtually unsettled and little-farmed down in its entirety has strong literary associations with the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The north of the long hilltop is pitted with very small old sand and gravel pits. From north, large woods are: Homewood, shared with Surrey, Jays Wood (woven up with a farmstead of similar size), Abester's Copse lining the eastern slope; Quellwood Common, Quell Copse and Windfell Wood/Ewhurst Copse (together a tapering triangle on the south side), Leazers Wood, Bridge Reeds, Sheetland, Lye Wood (a break in a linear farm), and the belts of woodland of Alder and Chase Woods, south of the town. Location Tennyson's Lane c. 1900. The gate marks the Surrey/Sussex border, and was a favourite destination for Lord Tennyson's walksView from away The hill presents as a dark-sided mass that towers over the near parts of the Low Weald of West Sussex and, an elevated corner of south-west Surrey. Geologically part of the Greensand Ridge and lying on the western margins of the Weald, Blackdown has been protected as part of the South Downs National Park. It starts about south of Haslemere, and its northern slopes are in Surrey. There is no village or hamlet on Blackdown - Fernhurst is just to the southwest, and Lurgashall to the southeast. There are 3 National Trust car parks on Tennyson's Lane, which runs up Haste Hill from Haslemere, and a footpath from the town centre. It is also possible to walk to Blackdown from Lurgashall, walking up the steep southern escarpment. Blackdown is crossed by the Sussex Border Path and the Serpent Trail. Tennyson's Lane in memory of the poet is a high, slightly sunken, tree-tunnel lane that runs from Haslemere past the highest home, Aldworth House (today a couple of dwellings). The lane keeps to Arthur Paterson's description in 1905: > Trees meet overhead, copsewood surrounds it, and later, it is hedged by high > sandy banks thickly overgrown with plant and scrub; squirrels and rabbits, > and all other small woodland creatures, disport themselves over it. It > twists and turns, and to the stranger appears to lead nowhere in particular. Natural history Pine trees cleared and thinned to restore heathland The acid sandstone of Blackdown limits the range of plants. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Blackdown was a grazed common where trees were kept down by sheep, and heather dominated. After the end of regular grazing Scots Pine became the dominant species. The National Trust now carries out a programme of tree-felling and controlled burning to maintain and regenerate areas of open heath. The reserve has been fenced so that conservation grazing with cattle can be used as a management tool. Blackdown is an important habitat for insects and birds. A geological relief model of Blackdown, and much information on its natural history, can be found in the Haslemere Educational Museum. History Old Manor Farm, Tennyson's Lane Although common land, Blackdown was the property of various landowners until W. E. Hunter donated it to the National Trust in 1944, as a memorial to his wife. The Hunters are remembered by an inscribed stone seat at the Temple of the Winds. Flint artefacts show there has been settlement on Blackdown since the mesolithic period, around 6000 BC. The name of an ancient track, pen-y-bos, indicates links with the Celtic world long since lost in more accessible parts of south- east England. (The name \\"pen-y-bos\\" comes from the Brythonic language of the ancient Britons that lived in the area ‚Äì rather like the well-known pen-y- ghent in Yorkshire.) Blackdown is managed by the National Trust, with guidance and financial assistance from the Blackdown Committee of the National Trust. The ownership Blackdown Estate can be traced back to the fourteenth century when the first recorded William Yaldwyn of Blackdown was born in 1298 and received the Patent of Esquire in 1330 (died 1375) William de Blackdown and Sutton 1342‚Äì1418 is said to have fought at the Battle of Agincourt. From the first William Yaldwyn, the family tree shows Blackdown Estate as having been inherited,in succession, by eight generations of William Yaldwyn. Although the Yaldwyn's had owned extensive farmlands in Sussex for at least three hundred years before, it was William Yaldwyn the elder who succeeded to the property in 1600 and had the extraordinary drive to make full commercial use of the estate and surrounding lands. In 1627 William Yaldwyn the elder secured the sole right to purchase iron ore mined on the extensive Petworth Estate.This made him an extremely wealthy man and by 1640 he completed the build of the central portion of the present Blackdown House. During the Civil War of 1642 there was an enormous increase in the demand for iron, cannons and other weapons. It is noted that Oliver Cromwell stayed at Blackdown House, although the actual date of his visit is unknown it was probably during 1644‚Äì45 when Oliver Cromwell went to assist the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller during the campaign in the west of England. The room where the General slept at Blackdown is still known as the Oliver Cromwell bedroom. The four poster bed remained in the house until Blackdown was sold by William Henry Yaldwyn (1801‚Äì1866) in 1844. When Richard Yaldwyn died in 1807 the Blackdown Estate consisted of 1300 acres and included Blackdown, Brockhurst, Vale Wool, High Diddlesford, Cotchett, Reeth, Sheetland, Cooks Bridge Farms and Blackdown Cottage Barfold-under-Beacon. Many members of the Yaldwyn family are buried at St. Laurence's at Lurgashall. (References Yaldwyn of the Golden Spurs by J.O.Randell published by the Melbourne Mast Gully Press 1980. Church records at Lurgashall of the Yaldwyn Family) As well as Aldworth House (sharing the steep east side leading to the wood-surrounded hamlet, or farmstead, Roundhurst Common) and Foxholes (which together formed the estate of Alfred, Lord Tennyson), walkers can see architecture, especially in Victorian and turn-of-the-20th-century, rustic styles (such as Arts and Crafts architecture). These include Blackdown House, west, surrounded by daffodils in the spring, and Old Manor Farm (Upper Roundhurst Farm), east. Because of its elevation, from 1796 to 1816 Blackdown hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which quickly linked the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in Portsmouth. Lord Tennyson Aldworth, painted by Helen AllinghamAside from its height and its wild beauty, Blackdown is best known as the site of the poet's houses, Aldworth and Foxholes. Keen to escape the summer 'trippers' who came to his Isle of Wight home, Farringford House, Tennyson purchased Blackdown, and built Aldworth in 1869. The French-style Gothic revival house was designed by Sir James Knowles, built of local sandstone. It stands on a ridge overlooking the Weald, with magnificent views. Lord Tennyson used it as his summer home, taking long walks over Blackdown. Helen Allingham was a frequent visitor then, and her illustrations to The homes of Tennyson vividly capture the landscape. He died in the house on 6 October 1892. Blackdown air crash On 4 November 1967, a medium-sized aereoplane of Iberia Airlines descended too far and crashed without survivors on its flight from M√°laga to London Heathrow, piloted by Captain Hernando Maura. It struck hard vegetation and the soil beneath, parts fell off, destroying a garage, killing a flock of sheep, and damaging parts of the roof of Upper Black Down House. Lost were an all-Spanish crew of six, 25 Britons, and two: Americans, Spaniards and Australians--actress June Thorburn was amongst them.

James Sterling Moran (January 1, 1908 - October 18, 1999) was a publicist and a press agent for film studios, manufacturers, retailers, Washington politicians from the 1930s to the 1980s. In 1989, Time ranked him as \\"the supreme master of that most singular marketing device--the publicity stunt.\\" Early life Born in Woodstock, Virginia, in 1907. Moran was the son of a chimney maker. When he was 12 years old, he was riding a bicycle and was hit by a car. The driver was so relieved to see Moran unharmed that he gave him $100, which Moran immediately used to take a train to New Orleans, returning home two weeks later. Instead of attending college, Moran took a variety of jobs: a tour guide in Washington, an airline executive and manager of a studio where Congressmen recorded speeches for local radio. Moran married several times but had no children. Notable stunts His attention- grabbing publicity stunts began in the 1930s. He made his mark when he went to Alaska on behalf of General Electric and sold a refrigerator to an Eskimo. On February 4, 1939, he was interviewed by Parks Johnson and Wally Butterworth on the Vox Pop radio program. Claiming that one must give in to impulsive behavior because inhibitions were \\"warping\\" our personalities, he threw eggs at an electric fan. In a Nevada river, during the 1944 Presidential campaign, he changed horses in midstream. Other stunts included walking a bull through a New York City china shop and promoting a real-estate development by spending ten days looking for a needle that had been dropped into a haystack. To publicize the 1947 movie The Egg and I, Moran sat on an ostrich egg for 19 days, four hours and 32 minutes. In the late 1940s, he promoted a Broadway show with a taxi constructed so that a chimpanzee was the apparent driver (with Moran secretly driving from the back seat). In 1959, for the premiere of The Mouse That Roared, he opened an embassy in Washington for a mythical country. To publicize a candy bar, he planned to fly a midget across Central Park in a kite, but police squelched the stunt, prompting Moran to remark, \\"'It's a sad day for American capitalism when a man can't fly a midget on a kite over Central Park.\\" Wagenvoord, James. Flying Kites, Macmillan, 1968. Radio and film He acted in several films: The Body Snatcher (1945), Specter of the Rose (1946), The Mask (1961) and Is There Sex After Death? (1971). He was a panelist on the 1954 TV quiz show What's in a Word? along with Clifton Fadiman, Audrey Meadows, Faye Emerson and Mike Wallace. Moran appeared on The Mike Douglas Show in 1964, and one of his last appearances was promoting the movie Yellowbeard (1983) on Late Night with David Letterman. Moran's show business and writer friends included Burl Ives, Lee J. Cobb, John Henry Faulk and the humorist H. Allen Smith, who wrote extensively about Moran in his books Lost in the Horse Latitudes (1944) and The Compleat Practical Joker (1953).

Although the first unit to carry the \\"5th Maryland\\" designation was organized in 1776 from volunteers in rural Maryland, the designation has been most often associated with militia units in Baltimore. The \\"5th Maryland\\" designation is the officially recognized traditional designation of the 175th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard. This entry refers to the rural 5th Maryland, whose lineage is separate and distinct from the Baltimore 5th Maryland perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment. American Revolution The first 5th Maryland Regiment was organized on March 27, 1776 composing of eight companies of volunteers from the counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Caroline, and Dorchester of the colony of Maryland and was authorized on September 16, 1776 for service with the Continental Army.Recruitment Areas It was assigned to the main Continental Army on December 27, 1776. On May 22, 1777, it was assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade and re-organized on May 12, 1779 to nine companies. It was reassigned to the Southern Department on April 5, 1780. The regiment was reassigned from the 1st Maryland Brigade to the Maryland Brigade on January 1, 1781. The regiment would see action during the Battle of Long Island (1776), the Battle of Brandywine (1777), the Battle of Germantown (1777), the Battle of Monmouth (1778), the Battle of Camden (1780), and the Battle of Guilford Court House (1781). The regiment was furloughed January 1, 1782, at Round O, South Carolina and disbanded on January 1, 1783. War of 1812 Difference From the Modern Fifth Regiment Another 5th Maryland, nicknamed \\"The Dandy Fifth,\\" was formed in 1867. The lineage of this unit is carried on today by the Maryland Army National Guard's 175th Infantry Regiment. This 5th Maryland also traces its lineage back to the American Revolutionary War, but ironically, its lineage does not include the Revolutionary War 5th Regiment. Instead, it traces its ancestry to militia raised in Baltimore, and its battle honors differ from those of the Revolutionary 5th Regiment. The 175th Infantry's lineage and honors does include the 5th Maryland Regiment of the War of 1812 and 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA of the American Civil War.

Origins The Port Reading Railroad started at the Port Reading Junction in Manville, New Jersey (near Bound Brook) with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey and headed eastward across northern Middlesex County, New Jersey to a terminus port called Port Reading, which was situated on the Arthur Kill in Woodbridge Township near Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Port Reading was constructed specifically to serve the needs of the Reading Railroad. Via the Port Reading Railroad and the affiliated Port Reading shipping terminal (which was also built by the Reading Railroad) along the Arthur Kill waterway, trains from the Reading Railroad's Trenton line (originally the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad) were capable of providing through service to/from the New York ports to points south and west, via a connection along the Raritan River from Manville, New Jersey to Bound Brook that was built between the Reading Railroad's Trenton line and the newly built Port Reading Railroad. Remnants of this connection, such as decaying trestles and track, can still be seen along the CSX/NS mainline through this area. The structures closest to the river are the former Reading Railroad connection. On the 1947 map of Middlesex County (http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/MIDDLESEX_COUNTY/MiddlesexCounty_1947.jpg) can be seen the route of the Port Reading Railroad, going from Bound Brook (which is just across the county line in Somerset County) to Port Reading. The route is labeled ‚ÄúPhiladelphia & Reading Railroad‚Äù, because of its ownership by the Reading Railroad. 20th-century decline The Port Reading Railroad and its parent the Reading Railroad, as was the case for many American railroads of the time period, saw a general drop off in business as the 20th Century progressed, and the railroads fell into disrepair and eventually went bankrupt. Secondary lines such as the Port Reading Railroad were hit especially hard during this period of decline, as the parent railroads neglected their branch lines as business declined. By the time Conrail took over most railroading in the northeastern United States in 1976, the renamed Port Reading Secondary (terminology used by Conrail to describe branch lines) was little more than a seldom used line that serviced local industries. This status continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s as Conrail saw little need for the redundant Port Reading Secondary beyond providing local freight services (Conrail used the Lehigh Line for most traffic into the New York area from the south). Conrail Shared Assets Operations ownership In 1999, CSX and Norfolk Southern split Conrail, but because of the Port Reading Secondary's proximity to the New York City consumer market, they could not decide how to split it, so, they took most of the lines near NYC and they created a separate company, Conrail Shared Assets Operations. It is jointly owned by the two railroads, to switch cars in the NYC area. (The same thing happened in the Philadelphia area and the Detroit area). In contrast to earlier decades, the 1990s was a decade in which railroads started to see some incremental increases in freight traffic as increases in freight demand and congested highways caused more shippers to move their freight via rail. To respond to the challenge of serving the increased demands of the New York/New Jersey region, CSAO invested millions of dollars to upgrade the Port Reading Secondary to handle long distance trains, including intermodal trains taking an alternate route to their terminals along the Chemical Coast Line, such as NS's E-Rail Terminal and the PANYNJ owned ExpressRail terminals. The Port Reading Secondary now offers an additional route to CSAO's rail facilities in the Port of New York and New Jersey, via the Chemical Coast line that runs along heavily industrialized eastern New Jersey, near the Arthur Kill waterway that separates New Jersey from Staten Island, New York. Rail traffic has increased substantially on the Port Reading Secondary in recent years as a result of the upgrades, and the line appears to have a bright future. Railroad signals currently exist at the crossing on Homestead Avenue in Avenel, but not at Omar Avenue in Avenel, where such signals would interfere with exiting trucks. Also, Carteret has signals at the crossing by the NJ Turnpike entrance. Also, Port Reading Conrail has signal gates at Blair Road, Rahway Avenue and Saint Georges Avenue in Woodbridge Township.

An infantry type regiment consisting of 728 soldiers, the 6th Maryland was composed of eight companies of volunteers from Prince Georges, Queen Anne's, Fredric, Cecil, Harford, and Ann Arundel counties in the colony of Maryland On 22 May 1777, the regiment was assigned to the 2nd Maryland Brigade. It was re-organized to nine companies on 12 May 1779 and reassigned to the Southern Department on 5 April 1780.  Background  Since the establishment of the American colonies, the British Navy protected the developing colonies, and the colonist paid taxes to the crown through import and export tariffs, taxes, and when requested, raised armies for London. This laissez-faire system where the colonist had a large degree of self-rule worked until 1763, when the British government decided that it needed to raise capital to pay off debt accrued through the French and Indian war, and the more encompassing Seven Years' War. In the minds of the British, the colonist ought to pay a significant portion of the debt as the war benefited the Americans by removing the threat of Indians and French colonist from their lands. Without consultation, Parliament passed the Sugar Act of 1764, and taxed molasses at three pence per gallon to collect revenue and pay off debts. The colonist felt as though this tax was unwarranted and that parliament should not burden the Americans with the cost of something they didn't need: a British army. In 1765, Parliament further alienated its colonies when Prime Minister Grenville introduced the Stamp Act. What made the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act so unprecedented and subject to popular disdain was that it was the first direct tax on the colonies.Edmund S. Morgan, The Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution (1995) To gain more control in the region, especially after New York disregarded the Mutiny Act, Parliament created the American Board of Customs, designed to efficiently collect taxes, specifically those proposed by Prime Minister Townshend. However, this inspired John Dickinson to write Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania that argued there should be no taxation without representation and further boycotts of British goods. After several brouhahas and altercations between American colonist and British civil servants, Parliament made the decision to station British soldiers in Boston. For many this action was an unacceptable infringement on their English Bill of rights and on 5 March 1770, British soldiers opened fire and killed twelve Bostonians. While there were wildly different accounts of the situation, with one anonymous person stating that the shooting was deliberate, and Captain Preston ‚Äì the commanding officer - stating the shooting was an accident, the result was the same. The Boston Massacre solidified American hatred of the British, and paved the way towards independence. The American Revolutionary War began in on 19 April 1775, when the Massachusetts Militia engaged the British army at the battles of Lexington and Concord, in Middlesex County. This prompted the newly formed first Continental Congress to authorized and appointed General George Washington to both take charge of the existing militia and for the creation of an entirely new Continental Army.Ferling, John E. 2015. Whirlwind: the American Revolution and the War That Won It.  History  An example of the Maryland Line fighting at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. In June 1775, the Second Continental Congress authorized the formation of a \\"Maryland Line\\", an entire militia composed and financed by Maryland to be incorporated into the newly formed Continental Army. On 18 January 1776, the Maryland government carried out the orders of the Second Continental Congress and created the following regiments:Polk, Ryan. \\"The Origin of the 'the Old Line State'\\", Maryland State Archives, 2005 ‚Ä¢ 1st Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1783 ‚Ä¢ 2nd Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1783 ‚Ä¢ 3rd Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1783 ‚Ä¢ 4th Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1783 ‚Ä¢ 5th Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1783 ‚Ä¢ 6th Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1781 ‚Ä¢ 7th Maryland Regiment, disbanded in 1781 ‚Ä¢ German Battalion (counted as half a regiment against the quota), disbanded in 1781 ‚Ä¢ Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment (counted as half a regiment against the quota), disbanded in 1781 ‚Ä¢ 2nd Independent Maryland Company - Somerset County absorbed into the 2nd Maryland Regiment in 1781 Once Maryland met its required quota of composing and equipping eight regiments, the units were formally incorporated into the Continental Army to fight aside militia from the twelve other states. The 6th Maryland Regiment was incorporated into the Continental Army on 27 March 1776.  Action seen  = Battle of Brandywine = Battle of Brandywine Battle of Germantown Fought on 11 September 1777 at Chadds Ford Township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the large-scale military battle saw action between the Continental army led by General George Washington and the British army led by General Sir William Howe. The overall objective for the American forces was to stop British advancement and prevent the takeover of Philadelphia. Despite both armies having similar strength - both around 15,000 men ‚Äì General Howe was able to flank Washington's army and force an American retreat. The overall battle lasted a record 11 hours and resulted in the loss of around 1,900 men: 1,300 from the Continental army and 600 from the British Army. The Maryland 6th Regiment entered the theater of war for the first time at the Battle of Brandywine as part of the 2nd Maryland Brigade led by Brigadier General Chevalier Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre.Robert K. Wright Jr. (1989). The Continental Army. Washington, D.C.: US Army Center of Military History. CMH Pub 60-4. This Brigade in conjunction with the 1st Maryland brigade, 3rd Virginia Brigade, 4th Virginia Brigade, New Jersey Brigade and the 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade formed a Division of 1,100 men led by Major General John Sullivan, known during the battle as Sullivan's Wing. Originally stationed northwards along the banks of the Brandywine River, Sullivan's Wing was ordered to prevent any British crossing. However, after British forces led by General Cornwallis flanked the Continental Army, Sullivan's Wing, and thus the 6th Maryland Regiment, was ordered to march north along with Stirling's Wing and Stephen's Wing to stymie Cornwallis's advancements and allow for an American retreat.Wood, William J. Battles of the Revolutionary War: 1775‚Äì1781. Chapel Hill, NC: Algonquin Books, 1990. (92-115) = Battle of Germantown = Fought on 4 October 1777, in Germantown, Pennsylvania between George Washington's Continental army and General William Howe's British forces, this battle occurred shortly after the Battle of Brandywine and solidified British control of Philadelphia. Originally the plan, drawn up by Washington himself, called for a four prong attack on Germantown in which Sullivan's wing, and the 6th Maryland, would take the center-right column and directly assault the camp. However, due to a thick fog, Sullivan's wing was unable to properly navigate and became trapped in the line of fire from a heavily fortified mansion. The Maryland Regiment ultimately ran out of ammunition along with the rest of the wing, and was forced to retreat. This initial retreat led to an eventual army wide retreat in which, coupled with the battle, 152 American soldiers died. The British were able to keep Philadelphia and the Americans were forced to set up winter camp at Valley Forge.Battle of Germantown ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia = Battle of Monmouth = Battle of Monmouth Fought on 28 June 1778, at Monmouth Court House, New Jersey, between George Washington's Continental army and Lieutenant General Henry Clinton's British forces, initiated by Washington, the primary objective was for the American forces to attack the rear of Clinton's army as the British left the courthouse for redeployment in New York.\\"American revolution History\\". History Channel. The overall battle was inconclusive in terms of strategic advantage, but the American forces suffered twice as many casualties as their British opponents, due to a disorganized American attack followed by a swift British counterattack. During this battle, the 6th Maryland Regiment was led by the notorious Colonel Otho Holland Williams. Moreover, the 6th Maryland fought alongside the 4th Maryland Regiment and the 2nd Maryland Regiment to make up the 2nd Maryland Brigade. This brigade, along with six other brigades made up Major General Nathanael Greene's Right Wing which was tasked to enfilade Clinton's forces.Martin, David G.

Conshohocken, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, 1993. = Battle of Camden = Fought on 16 August 1780, in Kershaw County, South Carolina by Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis commanding the British army, and Major General Horatio Gates commanding the American army, the battle was a British victory and led to further British control of the Carolinas. The original American objective was to capture the crossing at Camden as it was a strategic route in taking back control of the South. Gates decided to break up his 3,700 troops into two columns with the 2nd Maryland regiment commanded by Mordecai Gist as the right flank, and the unproven North Carolina regiment as the left. Once the battle began, it became clear that the untrained North Carolina regiment was outmatched and they quickly fled from battle. Alone the right flank and the 2nd Maryland regiment was forced to retreat and give up any potential land that they might have gained. Overall the British forces lost 68 men, while the Americans suffered a loss of 900 men killed and 1,000 captured.Wood, William J. Battles of the Revolutionary War: 1775‚Äì1781.

The original British objective was to attack Greene's encampment as to prevent reinforcements, which would inevitably lead to, a loss of British control in the region. However, when the British arrived at the Court house, where the Americans were stationed, Greene had already prepared three defense lines in which the 2nd Maryland Regiment was stationed in the third line, furthest from the initial British Attack. The British ultimately managed to break thorough the lines, and forced an American retreat, but while the battle only lasted ninety minutes, the British lost over a quarter of their men.Wood, William J.

The 117th episode of the series overall, it was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2004. In the episode, Michael Jackson, under the fake name of Martin Jefferson, moves to South Park, in order to get away from his popularity. Plot Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny notice that someone new has moved into the Donovans' former residence. A little boy named Blanket tells them they moved to South Park to escape city life. They then realize the house is filled with toys and games, and the backyard is a funfair. They meet Blanket's father Mr. Jefferson, a wealthy, eccentric, effeminate, pale-skinned man-child (obviously Michael Jackson wearing a fake moustache, though everyone remains oblivious). Kyle begins to notice Mr. Jefferson is neglecting his own son. Stan tells his parents about the Jeffersons and Sharon decides to invite them over to a dinner party they are having. The adults try to talk with Mr. Jefferson later that night at the dinner but he is more shy around adults than children. Cartman becomes jealous that they are having Mr. Jefferson over without him. Later that night at Stan's house, Stan is woken by Mr. Jefferson dressed up as Peter Pan who wants to play. Cartman then comes through the window after Mr. Jefferson does not want Stan to have Mr. Jefferson all to himself. Kyle then shows up at the door with Blanket who he found alone in his backyard. Mr. Jefferson suggests a sleepover between the boys and even though they are hesitant at first glance, they awkwardly agree. The next morning, Stan's parents walk in to see Mr. Jefferson in Stan's bed and scold Mr. Jefferson about how inappropriate it is for a man to sleep in bed with someone else‚Äôs children, but he calms them down by offering Randy and Sharon $100 each to be quiet and then Mr. Jefferson drags Blanket along out of Stan‚Äôs room and on their way back home. Sharon forbids the boys to see Mr. Jefferson anymore; none of the boys seem have a problem with it and are all indifferent about the situation, since Mr. Jefferson is too childish and creepy to be around with except Cartman who still thinks Mr. Jefferson is his new best friend. Meanwhile at the Park County Police Station, Harrison Yates gets a report about the Jeffersons that says they are wealthy and black, and the whole department sets off to frame him for a crime as they express their disdain for African Americans who are wealthier than they are. They spend that night planting cocaine, pubic hair, and blood in Mr. Jefferson's home and wait for him to come home and then fall asleep. When Mr. Jefferson returns with Blanket from Stan's house, the officers see he is not really black and they abort the operation, sick with themselves that they had almost put an innocent white man in jail. Mr. Jefferson refuses to let Blanket outside anymore because he thinks everyone is against them. Stan and Kyle start to fear for the safety of Blanket after seeing Mr. Jefferson dangle him from the balcony of his house. They decide to rescue Blanket by sneaking into his room at night and switching him with Kenny, who is uncharacteristically shown without his hooded parka and speaking clearly. Harrison Yates returns home planning on retiring the force, but his wife tells him that \\"framing wealthy black people is in his blood\\", and encourages him to stay on the force. Harrison agrees, and decides to check into the Mr. Jefferson case to see what went wrong. Meanwhile, Mr. Jefferson, desperately trying to stop his face from falling apart from years of plastic surgery, calls his plastic surgeon in California to see if he can fly out and put his face back together. At the same time, Harrison Yates is calling the Santa Barbara Police Department, Mr. Jefferson's former place of residence. They alert him that they framed a rich black man of molestation who did not look black at all, and he ran away before the trial. Stan and Kyle try to smuggle Blanket out of the house but are confronted by a horribly disfigured Mr. Jefferson who wants them to play. They run to Blanket's room and Mr. Jefferson, upon seeing Kenny dressed up like Blanket, throws him in the air playfully. However, Kenny is thrown too high and is killed when his head smashes through the ceiling. Stan and Kyle scream out their usual lines, which alerts Mr. Jefferson to their presence. Mr. Jefferson chases the other three outside where the police are waiting to arrest him for the molestation charges put in Santa Barbara. A crowd gathers around. Cartman then jumps to the defense of Mr. Jefferson, saying he is tired of all the \\"lies\\" being spread about Mr. Jefferson. He adds that Mr. Jefferson may be different, but it was only because he had to work all the time when he was young and never had a proper childhood of his own, which was why he associated more with children. However, Kyle then yells at Cartman that even if all of the accusations about Mr. Jefferson are not true and the police really do go around framing rich black men, that he has to grow up because he has a child of his own now. Mr. Jefferson then sees what he should do and decides to be more of a father to Blanket and give away their wealth to the needy, no longer leaving a reason for the police to arrest him since he is no longer rich, and saying that there was \\"no point in putting another poor black man in jail\\".

B., W. E. Duellman, and M. P. Heinicke . 2008. New World direct-developing frogs (Anura: Terrarana): molecular phylogeny, classification, biogeography, and conservation. Zootaxa 1737: 1-182. Many of the 200 species of the genus are commonly known as \\"rain frogs\\" or \\"robber frogs\\", due to their sharp, high-pitched, insect-like calls. The best-known species is the common coqu√≠ (E. coqui), which is both a national symbol of Puerto Rico and a notorious invasive species in Hawaii. Two Eleutherodactylus species, E. limbatus and E. iberia, are among the smallest known frogs, measuring only 8.5 mm in lengthThe Center for Reptile and Amphibian Research: Interesting Facts About Amphibians (only slightly larger than Paedophryne amauensis, which measures around 7.7 mm). Etymology The name \\"Eleutherodactylus\\" is derived from the Greek words for ‚Äòfree-toed‚Äô, composed of the Ancient Greek ' (, ‚Äòfree, unbound‚Äô) and ' (, ‚Äòfinger, toe‚Äô). Most species are small, slender, and cryptically colored, with three to five free toes. A few, such as the web-footed coqu√≠ (E. karlschmidti) of Puerto Rico, do have completely webbed feet. Distribution and habitat Species of Eleutherodactylus are found throughout the Neotropics, including the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Additionally, the common coqu√≠ (E. coqui) has been introduced to several islands in the Hawaiian archipelago, as well as elsewhere in the Pacific. They can be terrestrial, arboreal, or aquatic, typically living in forests or riparian areas, and feeding primarily upon arthropods. Many Eleutherodactylus species have highly restricted ranges and are found on only one island or in one or a few localities. Even some of these restricted species can occur at very high densities. Reproduction and development All species of Eleutherodactylus are characterized by direct development, in which eggs hatch directly into small frogs, completely bypassing the tadpole stage. This adaptation may be largely responsible for their ecological and evolutionary success. Most species are characterized by parental behaviors, such as egg-guarding by either the male or female parent. In some cases, even young froglets are attended by parents. Another extinct Puerto Rican species, the golden coqu√≠ (E. jasperi), gave birth to live young. Many species (for example, Cook's robber frog, E. cooki), also of Puerto Rico, exhibit sexual dimorphism in size and color. Phylogenetics The basis of forming this genus has been morphological, but sequence comparisons of protein-encoding DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and ribosomal RNA have shown geographic range is a much more consistent predictor of cladistics for this group of frogs. The climbing habits of many species have evolved independently. All true members of the genus have been clustered into subgenera, but many less-related species require more genetic data before they are to be officially classified elsewhere. The theory that the eleutherodactyline colonization of Central America and the Caribbean from their origins in South America occurred during the Cretaceous has fallen out of favor. The fossil record, combined with molecular clock analyses, indicate the subgenera were probably founded by small groups of individuals by flotsam dispersal during the Eocene or Oligocene epochs. Land bridges would have been limited to facilitating dispersal between West Indian islands, however, the Oligocene division of Hispaniola and Cuba resulted in further speciation. The distribution of the subgenus Syrrhopus is most likely due to a secondary dispersal to Central America from the Greater Antilles during the Miocene. The formation of the Panama Isthmus during the Pliocene has caused some intercontinental distribution among the clades, although only 20 \\"South American frogs\\" have ever made it northwards after the original colonization. Sensu stricto, however, it should exclude clades with distributions south of the Panama Canal.

Because he disliked his given name, his readers knew him as H. T. Webster, and his signature was simply Webster. His friends, however, called him Webby. Because of the humor and human interest in his cartoons, he was sometimes compared to Mark Twain, and his art style was quite similar to the work of Clare Briggs. During his lifetime, Webster drew more than 16,000 single-panel cartoons.  Biography  Born in Parkersburg, West Virginia in 1885, Webster grew up in the small city (pop. 3,365) of Tomahawk, Wisconsin where his father was a druggist. He began drawing at age seven. When he was 12, he switched from cigarettes to cigars, and that same year he sold his first cartoon for $5 to the magazine Recreation. He studied drawing from a correspondence course when he was 15, and two years later, he left high school and Tomahawk to study in Chicago at the Frank Holmes School of Illustration, where cartoonist Harry Hershfield had also studied. However, the Holmes School closed only a few weeks after Webster's arrival, bringing an end to his formal art training.\\"Webster's Unalloyed\\", American Heritage. With little success as a freelance artist, Webster began a salaried job with the Denver Republican, moving to the rival Denver Post when he was offered $15 a week as a sports cartoonist. Webster commented, \\"If they had known it, they could have got me for $1.50\\". Christmas card by H. T. Webster He returned to Chicago, where he spent three years drawing front-page political cartoons for the Chicago Inter Ocean, prompting one politician to introduce a bill in the state legislature forbidding unflattering cartoons. After two years with The Cincinnati Post, he had enough saved to spend a year traveling around the world. Returning from China, he joined the New York Tribune in 1912. He married Ethel Worts on August 2, 1916, two weeks after he met her. Caspar Milquetoast quietly enters H. T. Webster's The Timid Soul The titles of Webster's cartoons reflected the different situations, as in Our Boyhood Ambitions and Bridge. In 1924, he moved to the New York World and soon after added The Timid Soul featuring Caspar Milquetoast, a wimpy character whose name is derived from milk toast. Webster described Caspar Milquetoast as \\"the man who speaks softly and gets hit with a big stick\\". The modern dictionary definition of milquetoast (meaning a very shy or retiring person) comes from Webster's cartoons. In 1927 Webster trained himself to draw left-handed in three months after a severe case of arthritis impaired the use of his right hand. In 1931, the World folded, and that same year, Simon & Schuster published a collection of The Timid Soul reprints. Webster then went back to the New York Tribune (now known as the New York Herald Tribune), where he then launched a Timid Soul Sunday strip. He alternated his various features throughout the week: Caspar Milquetoast was seen on both Sunday and Monday. Youth's glories (The Thrill That Comes Once in a Lifetime) and the downside (Life's Darkest Moment) appeared on Saturdays and Tuesdays. On Wednesday, The Unseen Audience offered satirical jabs at radio. How to Torture Your Husband (or Wife) was published each Thursday, and the week ended with Bridge on Fridays.\\"Average Man,\\" Time, Monday, November 26, 1945. During the 1940s, Webster lived at Shippan Point in Stamford, Connecticut. His assistant, Herb Roth, took over when Webster died in 1952. When Roth died the following year, the series came to an end with the last new drawing appearing in the New York Herald Tribune on April 4, 1953. Television On June 22, 1949, the DuMont Television Network adapted The Timid Soul to television as the premiere presentation of their Program Playhouse series. Caspar Milquetoast was portrayed by Ernest Truex. Bibliography H. T.

Club career Defendi was first spotted as a 16-year-old by the then Tottenham Hotspur Director of Sport Frank Arnesen. He was the first player signed under the Frank Arnesen and Jacques Santini era at Spurs from Cruzeiro for a fee of ¬£600,000 on July 3, 2004, although he had to wait for his passport to arrive in August for the deal to be officially completed. He failed to make a first team appearance for Tottenham but featured in a number of reserve team matches. He was deemed surplus to requirements by Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol, as he was first allowed to travel back to Brazil to seek a contract with a new club which proved unsuccessful, before he was farmed out on loan to Udinese Calcio in January 2006. He made two league appearances before leaving for A.S. Roma in August 2006, again on loan. He made an appearance in the Champions League and in the Coppa Italia for the capital club, but didn't manage to play a league game in Serie A. Defendi returned to Tottenham Hotpur from Roma after his loan period ended. On August 9, 2007 Tottenham announced his departure to the Italian Serie B club Avellino on a permanent transfer. Defendi became a free agent after the bankruptcy of Avellino and returned to Brazil. He joined the Palmeiras reserves in March 2010.

The initial decisions are not based on a preconceived theoretical framework.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) The researcher begins by identifying some key concepts and features which they will research about. This gives a foundation for the research. A researcher must be theoretically sensitive so that a theory can be conceptualized and formulated as it emerges from the data being collected.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) Caution must be taken so as to not limit oneself to specific aspects of a theory; this will make a researcher blind towards other concepts and aspects of the theory. The main question in this method of sampling is this: what groups should the researcher turn to next in the data collection process, and why? History of theoretical sampling According to Chenitz and Swanson (1986), theoretical sampling emerged with the foundation of grounded theory, which was first developed by Glaser and Strauss in 1967. Grounded theory can be described as a research approach for the collection and analysis of qualitative data for the purpose of generating explanatory theory, in order to understand various social and psychological phenomena. Its focus is to develop a theory from continuous comparative analysis of data collected by theoretical sampling.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) Advantages and disadvantages The main advantage of theoretical sampling is that it strengthens the rigour of the study if the study attempts to generate the theory in the research area. The application of theoretical sampling provides a structure to data collection as well as data analysis. It is based on the need to collect more data to examine categories and their relationships and assures that representativeness exists in the category.(Coyne, 1997) Theoretical sampling has inductive as well as deductive characteristics.(Coyne, 1997) It is very flexible as the researcher can make shifts in plans and emphasize early in the research process so that the data gathered reflects what is occurring in the field.(Coyne, 1997) Certain disadvantages may be associated with this sampling method. It is a highly systematic method due to which application of theoretical sampling requires more resources like time and money as compared to other sampling methods.(Oppong, 2013) It is a very complicated method and not easy to understand. To achieve depth in developing the categories researcher proceeds to another location to increase breadth in the category which sounds very complex and indeed is not helpful for the novice and may be problematic.(Coyne, 1997) Key features While discussing theoretical sampling, there are three features that must be considered: 1\\\\. Choosing cases in terms of the theory In this feature, the basis is constructed on an ideal universe or a wider universe where there is a larger comprehension or social explanation according to which the researcher is able to construct their theory. This theoretical universe will allow for better-formulated samples which are more meaningful and sensible than others. This kind of sample will also be a wider representative sample. So in this type of sampling, we select samples that have a particular process, examples, categories and even types that are relevant to the ideal or wider universe. One of the most commonly given example is of discourse analysis of gender. The sample relevant units in qualitative research are very often viewed as theoretically defined. This basically means that attributes such as gender, ethnicity and even age can't be the basis for a sample. This is due to the fact that most often attributions are themselves the topic of the research.(Silverman & Marvasti, 2008) 2\\\\. Choosing deviant cases One of the leading philosophies in theoretical sampling is the fact that the researcher doesn't choose cases that are supportive to their argument. In theoretical sampling the belief is that researchers need to overcome the tendency to select cases and instances that support their side of the argument. Instead it states that it would be more beneficial to look out for negative instances and cases which are defined by the theory that we are working with. This feature basically states that a researcher should not exclude any fact from the process of research just because it seems impossible. Researchers should insist on the fact that if they imagine it then it can't be impossible.(Silverman & Marvasti, 2008) 3\\\\. Changing the size of your sample during the course of the research The first two features of a theoretical sample deals with issues right at the beginning of the research project. The third feature however deals with concerns or application during the process of the research. One of the advantages the qualitative research as a whole has over quantitative research is its flexibility. In theoretical sampling the researcher manipulates or changes the theory, sampling activities as well as the analysis during the course of the research. Flexibility occurs in this style of sampling when the researchers want to increase the sample size due to new factors that arise during the research. Flexibility also occurs when the researcher's wishes to use a small sample during the initial stages of the research but increase the sample size to test developing generalizations. Finally flexibility is also allowed when the researcher finds unexpected generalization and wants to look into deviant cases.(Silverman & Marvasti, 2008) Sampling strategies In theoretical sampling, there are two main criteria for initial data collection, general sociological perspective and problem area. Collection criteria for the future cannot be planned in advance as the criterion emerges as the theory evolves. Which groups are included? To study this often multiple comparison groups are used. The groups are chosen based on the theoretical criteria or relevance. Sociologists or researchers often evade the problem by studying only one group and trying to describe the subgroups. Often the differences among the groups or sub groups are just stated but a theoretical analysis is not conducted. One of the advantages here is that the analyst has the liberty to adjust their control of the data collection, to ensure that the data is relevant to the emerging theory. Also, usually groups are chosen only for a single comparison, therefore there is usually no pre-planned or definite set of groups for all the categories. Another interesting fact is that it is almost impossible to cite the number of groups and the type of groups until the research is completed. One of the major differences with comparative analysis is that comparative analysis focus on the verification and description using accurate evidence.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) Why are groups selected? Comparing groups gives the researcher the advantage of development of variety of categories. The main criterion is that the data collected should apply to a particular category or property, irrespective of the differences or similarities. The researcher's main focus is to keep the purpose of the research clear. As the researcher compares groups, he gains control over two scales of generality. They are: 1\\\\. Conceptual level 2\\\\. Population scope Also differences and similarities can either be maximised or minimised, depending on the type of groups being compared. This gives the researcher more control and helps them discover more categories. This then helps them to develop and relate to more theoretical properties which lead to enhancing the emerging theory. When the researcher minimises differences among groups, s/he is able to establish a definite set of conditions under which a category exists. Whereas on maximising, s/he is able to gather a variety of data with strategic similarities among the groups. Generally in theoretical sampling, the researcher aims at maximising differences as this brings about greater coverage in the variation among different aspects, making the theory more elaborate.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) How are the groups selected? The researcher should actively search for data that is theoretically relevant. Rather than focusing on the group, greater focus should be placed on the emerging theory. The larger the contrast between the groups, the greater will be the probability of evident comparison between the two. As the research progresses and the researcher studies the same group or different sub-groups, s/he then arrives at few categories, which on saturation generate their theory.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) Uses of theoretical sampling Initially, theoretical sampling is used only for a pragmatic purpose of generating a theory. The ability to generate an extensive understanding of a completely well theory defined in any field through research takes in the account of theoretical sampling. It first focuses on the problem area and then into the various approaches that need the basis of grounded theory. For example, how confident men handle prospective marks or how policemen act toward people of African descent or what happens to students in medical school that turns them into doctors, is dependent on the theoretical framework that the researcher arrives with.(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1999) Theoretical sampling helps in exploring various hibernating research questions that are eventually evident in the data collection as a theory. According to Glaser and Holton (2004), Grounded theory that has a data collecting inclination towards theoretical sampling was first derived from qualitative sampling. Theoretical sampling methods are now considered as the diluted version of grounded theory that is now used in health care research where researcher may want to find out the different reasons for a particular illness to trigger in a particular kind of population.(Breckenridge & Jones, 2009) According to Sandelowski in 1995, although theoretical sampling is often misconstrued as purposive sampling, the uses of theoretical sampling vary to a large extent. Also, the selection criteria of participants for theoretical sampling changes according to the needs and changes that occur in the theoretical study at the given time. Theoretical sampling is considered to be purpose driven and it explicitly carries out its function on the basis of an emerging theory.(Breckenridge & Jones, 2009) The main focus of theoretical research is to use its development through a constant comparative analysis of data that is gained through theoretical sampling for a better understanding of the theory produced.(Coyne, 1997) Theoretical saturation The concept of saturation was first defined in the context of grounded theory as theoretical saturation. In qualitative research the word saturation is extensively used almost interchangeably with data saturation, thematic saturation, theoretical saturation and conceptual saturation. Saturation can be simply defined as data satisfaction. It is when the researcher reaches a point where no new information is obtained from further data. Saturation point determines the sample size in qualitative research as it indicates that adequate data has been collected for a detailed analysis. However, there are no fixed sizes or standard tests that determine the required data for reaching saturation. For example, in many phenomenographic studies, theoretical saturation is often reached after 15 to 30 participants, whereas other methods may require far fewer, or greater, numbers. Example of theoretical sampling An example of theoretical sampling is best described by Glaser and Strauss in the 1960s. It is a memo from their research for ‚ÄúAwareness of Dying‚Äù. It explains how the search of data is active throughout the research process as the researcher keeps probing into other relevant theoretical questions- ‚ÄúVisits to the various medical services were scheduled as follows: I wished first to look at services that minimized patient awareness (and so first looked at premature baby service and then a neurosurgical service where patients were frequently comatose). I wished next to look at dying in a situation where expectancy of the staff was great and dying was quick, so I observed on an Intensive Care Unit. Then I wished to observe on a service where staff expectations of terminality were great but where patients might or might not be, and where dying tended to be slow. So I looked next at a cancer service. I wished then to look at conditions where death was unexpected and rapid, and so looked at an emergency service. While we were looking at some different types of services, we also observed the above types of serviced at other types of hospitals. So, our scheduling of types of services was directed by a general conceptual scheme- which included hypotheses about awareness, expectedness and rate of dying- as well as by a developing conceptual structure including matters not at first envisioned. Sometimes we returned to services after the initial two or three or four weeks of continuous observation, in order to check upon items which needed checking or had been missed in the initial period.\\"(Glaser & Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, 1967) See also * Axial coding * Grounded theory * Sampling (statistics) * Sampling (case studies) References * Charles C.

It is published by Portland Press and was established in 1906. History The journal was established in 1906 by Benjamin Moore, holder of the first UK chair of biochemistry at the University of Liverpool, with financial support from Edward Whitley, an heir of the Greenall Whitley brewers.Clark J. Biochemical Journal Centenary (2006) (accessed 30 September 2007) The two served as the first editors and the journal was initially published by the Liverpool University Press.Anon (1906) Bio-Chemical Journal 1: i‚Äìiii (accessed 30 September 2007) It was acquired by the Biochemical Club (later renamed the Biochemical Society) in October 1912, shortly after the society's foundation; at that time the journal had 170 subscribers. From 1913, it was published in conjunction with Cambridge University Press, with William Bayliss and Arthur Harden chairing the editorial board; the original title of The Bio-Chemical Journal became The Biochemical Journal at that date.Anon Biochemical Journal (1913) 7: i‚Äìvi (accessed 30 September 2007) The journal at first appeared at irregular intervals, with between three and twelve issues appearing annually in a single volume. From 1948, two volumes were published annually, with four or five parts per volume, and the frequency increased rapidly over the years, reaching the current frequency of eight volumes in three parts in 1974.BJ Central: Contents by Issue (accessed 30 September 2007) Current journal Eight volumes are published each year with each volume consisting of three parts (24 issues per year). To mark the centenary of the journal in 2006, a free online archive back to the journal's first issue in 1906 was launched. All papers are available as pdfs, and recent papers are also available in a proprietary format called Enhanced Electronic Serials Interface-View (EESI- View). The journal won the first Charlesworth Award for Best Online Journal in 2007.ALPSP: ALPSP/Charlesworth Awards 2007 (accessed 30 September 2007)Biochemical Journal hits the heights The Biochemist (14 September 2007) (accessed 30 September 2007) The judges described the online journal as '\\"visually attractive and easy to use ... maintains the character of the journal while exploiting the digital medium to offer a range of additional features\\". Towards the end of 2009, the journal launched a new technological innovation: the Semantic Biochemical Journal. The software used, Utopia Documents, transforms the content of the journal by dynamically linking documents to research data, enabling readers to interact with and manipulate the information in the journal's scientific papers more effectively. The software turns static images, tables, and text into objects that can be linked, annotated, visualized, and analysed interactively.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in BIOBASE, BIOSIS, CAB International, Chemical Abstracts Service, Current Contents, EMBASE, International Food Information Service, MEDLINE/Index Medicus, ProQuest Information & Learning, and the Science Citation Index. Indexed by ISI Biochemical Journal received an impact factor of 4.396 as reported in the 2014 Journal Citation Reports by Thomson Reuters, ranking it 67 out of 289 journals in the category Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.

He was capped 21 times for his country and played a significant part in Germany's UEFA Euro 1996 winning campaign. He is currently working for Tottenham Hotspur. His son, Niklas plays for SV Empor Berlin as a goalkeeper. Club career Freund started his career at Stahl Brandenburg, coming through their youth system. He has said that the Stasi made an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as an informer during his time at the club. In 1991, he was transferred to FC Schalke 04 and he established himself as an important midfield player. Schalke were forced to sell Freund due to financial reasons in 1993 to Borussia Dortmund where he stayed until 1998. During his time at Dortmund, he won the league twice in 1995 and 1996 and gained a Champions League medal in 1997, but was left out of the squad for the final altogether. In December 1998, Freund transferred to English Premiership club Tottenham Hotspur. During his time with the London club, he won the League Cup in 1999, starting in the center of midfield in Spurs's 1‚Äì0 win over Leicester City. He stayed at the club until 2003, and despite never scoring a goal in 131 appearances across all competitions, he became a firm fans favourite at the club for his heart, work ethic and commitment. On 4 December 2009, Freund was inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur hall of fame alongside Darren Anderton. At the tail end of his career he went on to have short spells at 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Leicester City. International career Between 1995 and 1998, he won 21 caps for the German national team. He won UEFA Euro 1996 with Germany, where he missed out on a place in the final because of an injury in their semi-final win over England. He also appeared at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where Germany fell at the quarter-final stage to Croatia; Freund was an unused substitute in the match. Coaching career On 1 September 2007, Freund was appointed assistant head-coach of the German U-20 team. On 5 December 2007, he was named as a new assistant to Nigeria coach Berti Vogts for the time of the African Nations Cup. He then resumed his work as assistant to German U20-manager Frank Engel. In May 2009 he finished his coaching badges and on 17 July 2009 he was appointed manager of the German U-16 team signing a two-year contract. A year later he began managing the German U-17 team leading them to a runners up medal at the 2011 UEFA European U-17 Football Championship and a third place at the World Cup in Mexico. He then started working with the new generation of U-16 players. On 11 July 2012, Freund was appointed assistant head coach of Tottenham Hotspur. On 5 August 2014 he was appointed International Technical Coordinator. On 21 April 2017, while on Sky Sports, Freund stated that he was not interested in getting back into coaching. He instead was enjoying the freedom from pressure which he was experiencing as a pundit. Television career In 2006, he appeared alongside Boris Becker in a special England v. Germany edition of the popular panel show They Think It's All Over. At the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Freund began working as a pundit for Eurosport's coverage of the German Bundesliga and Sky Deutschland. He is also a co-commentator for the English world feed of the Bundesliga. Personal life Freund is married and has one son and two daughters.

Double Your Money is a British quiz show hosted by Hughie Green. Originally broadcast on Radio Luxembourg since 1950 and based on American radio quiz Take It Or Leave It in 1940‚Äì1947, it transferred to ITV in 1955, a few days after the commercial channel began broadcasting. It was produced by Associated- Rediffusion until 1964 and then by Rediffusion London, and it finished in 1968 when the company lost its franchise. There were 260 thirty-minute episodes. Throughout its run the show was one of the most consistently popular programmes on British television. The quiz format was similar to The 64,000 Dollar Question, with prize money doubling at each question from ¬£1 to ¬£32 and multi-part answers being required at the harder stages. When contestants correctly answer a three-part question to reach the ¬£1,000 (¬£1,024 until 1960) Treasure Trail, they were placed in sound-proofed 'isolation booths', where the fans were turned off and the temperature grew, making contestants sweat and look nervous. The ¬£64 question required two correct answers and the ¬£128 question featured three parts. The remaining questions featured a four-part question for ¬£256, a five-part question for ¬£512 and a six-part question for the top prize. Only one contestant at a time could play the Treasure Trail. The 8 November 1966 (air date) show came from The House of Friendship, Moscow, Russia, where Monica Rose and Natasha Vasylyeva were both hostesses and, because the Communist Party would not allow money to be given away, the big prize was a television set. Female hostesses on the show included 18-year-old Valerie Drew and an elderly cleaner named Alice Earley who was taken on by Green after first appearing as a contestant.

She went on to host his next show The Sky's the Limit.

Brinell is noted as the creator of a method for quantifying the surface hardness of materials, now known as the Brinell hardness test. His name is also commemorated in the description of a failure mechanism of material surfaces known as Brinelling. Biography Brinell was born in Bringetofta, N√§ssj√∂ Kommun, Sweden. He began his career as an Engineer at the Lesj√∂fors Ironworks and in 1882 became chief engineer at the Fagersta Ironworks. In 1903 he became Chief Engineer at Jernkontoret, the Swedish Ironmasters' Association. He remained at that post until 1914. Brinell was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1902, and of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in 1919. He was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1907. He died of pneumonia in 1925 in Stockholm. Legacy Brinell is best known today for the Brinell hardness test, which he proposed in 1900. In this test a 10-millimetre diameter hardened steel or carbide ball is pushed into the surface of the material being tested, with a 3000 kg imposed load. The depth to which the ball penetrates the material surface is an indication of the Brinell Hardness Number, which is calculated as follows: BHN = load in kilograms divided by the spherical area of the indentation in square millimetres (refer to Brinell scale for method of calculation) It is a rapid, non-destructive (except at the surface being tested) means of determining the hardness of metals. This area is a function of the ball diameter and the depth of the indentation. With minor variations, his test still remains in wide use. This method is best for achieving the macro-hardness of material, particularly those materials with hetrogenous structure.

A persistent legend claims that large numbers were driven to extinction by missionaries and petroleum companies after oil exploration began nearby in 1964. However, when they were ‚Äúrediscovered‚Äù by Catholic priests in 1966, only three elderly survivors remained. Their last contact with outsiders ‚Äì an American Evangelical missionary and his Siona-Secoya translators ‚Äì occurred in 1973. References *Cabodevilla, Miguel Angel.

History Also known as Birch ratings, Birch Radio ultimately employed more than 1,200 people nationwide and, together with its Birch Radio/Canada subsidiary, had sales offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Toronto and Montreal. At its peak, Birch Radio interviewed more than 100,000 persons per month and included among its subscribers major advertisers such as McDonalds, Anheuser-Busch, Delta Airlines, Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola, major advertising agencies such as BBDO/New York, Ogilvy & Mather, Foote Cone & Belding, BDA/BBDO/Atlanta and Tracey-Locke/Dallas. Birch broadcast subscribers included CBS, ABC, Clear Channel, Bonneville and hundreds of smaller broadcast groups. Birch Radio was sold in 1987 to Dutch publishing conglomerate (and ultimate acquirer of the Nielsen television rating service) VNU; the company was merged with VNU subsidiary Scarborough Research. Birch Radio's founder, radio industry veteran Tom Birch, became Chairman and CEO of the merged Birch/Scarborough entity until his departure in 1990 to form Opus Media Group; Scarborough Research continued to use that name. In December 1992, two years after Birch's departure, VNU sold a 50% interest in Scarborough to Arbitron and shuttered the Birch Radio ratings service. Scarborough continues today as the leading provider of local television, radio and newspaper qualitative and shopping behavior information.

It was made up of men from eastern and northern Virginia for service with the Continental Army. History The Revolutionary Virginia Convention held in May 1776 resulted in delegates voting for a resolution to direct Virginia's delegates in Philadelphia to seek independence from the British and form a confederation of the colonies. They knew additional military strength was required. Virginia Governor Patrick Henry authorized Major-Commandant Theodorick Bland to raise a volunteer battalion. Bland had participated in the expulsion of Royal Governor Dunmore. The 1st Continental Light Dragoons regiment was first authorized 8 June 1776 in the Virginia State Troops as the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th (Captain Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee) and 6th Troops of Light Horse. On 25 June 1776 it mustered as the Virginia Light Horse Regiment. It was first adopted by and then accepted into the Continental Army, designated as the 1st Continental Light Dragoons on 25 November 1776. Six months later, when General George Washington needed cavalry to counter that of the British, the Continental Congress on November 25, 1776 requested that Virginia transfer Major Bland's Light Horse to the Continental Army. Although reluctant, Virginia acceded to the request. Bland's Light Horse became the 1st Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons. Bland had six troops of cavalry. Each contained 3 officers, 3 corporals, a drummer, a trumpeter, and 29 privates. Three quartermasters provided logistical support for the group. In March of 1777 this 1st Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons ‚Äî plus the three other regiments ‚Äî were reorganized, resulting in a slight increase in their numbers. The reorganized regimental headquarters consisted of a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel and a major, who were supported in turn by a staff consisting of a chaplain, a quartermaster, a surgeon and mate, a paymaster, a riding master, a saddler, a trumpet major, an adjutant and 4 supernumeraries‚Äîcadets undergoing training who were used as the colonel's messengers. 1778 Roster of Continental Light Dragoons Each troop consisted of 32 privates, 1 armorer, 1 farrier, 1 trumpeter, 4 corporals, 1 quartermaster sergeant, a drill or an orderly sergeant, a cornet, a lieutenant, and a captain‚Äîa total of 280 men and officers. Whether any of the four regiments of Dragoons was ever at full strength is uncertain.Robert K. Wright Jr. The Continental Army, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1983, p.107 p.128Burt Garfield Loescher, Washington's Eyes: The Continental Light Dragoons, Old Army Press, 1977. The 2nd Continental Light Dragoons hailed from Connecticut and was led by Elisha Sheldon. It fought with distinction, whether mounted or unmounted, and at war's end had 225 men. The 3rd Regiment‚Äî\\"Lady Washington's Dragoons\\"‚Äîwas also from Virginia. The 3rd was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George Baylor and seconded by Major Alexander Clough, one of George Washington's spies. The 3rd was the victim of a heinous act of war when they were attacked in their billet and refused quarter in 1778. The 4th and final regiment drew its membership from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey. The 4th suffered great losses at the Battle of Camden. So at the very best in 1777, there were 1120 dragoons in the Continental army, considerably under the 3,000 troops authorized by the Continental Congress. Officers aside, there were no other mounted troops in the whole continental army. The English also had limited cavalry, fielding their 16th Queen's Lancers and 17th Regiment of Dragoons.Robert K.

Lee's Troop was expanded into Lee's Legion, designated the 2nd Partisan Corps in 1781. The 1st Continental Light Dragoons were reassigned to the Southern Department on 8 November 1778, when the Corps of Continental Light Dragoons was broken up as an organization. The regiment was officially re-organized on 1 January 1781, consisting of four mounted and two dismounted troops. It was redesignated as the 1st Legionary Corps. On 2 November 1782, reflecting an amalgamation that had occurred in the spring of 1780, the unit was consolidated with the 3d Legionary Corps, maintaining five troops. The new unit was designated 1st Legionary Corps. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Guilford Court House. The regiment was disbanded on November 15, 1783, at Winchester, Virginia.

The Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy (), better known as the Pinsk Flotilla, was the inland branch of the Polish Navy operating on the Vistula river and in the area of the Pinsk Marshes (Dnieper‚ÄìBug Canal) between the Polish‚ÄìBolshevik War and World War II. Under Commodore Witold ZajƒÖczkowski, it was active in the invasion of Poland and fought against both German and Soviet forces.  History  During the Polish-Bolshevik War the Pinsk Marshes proved to be almost impassable to troops of both sides. Lack of roads and railways posed a serious danger to infantry and cavalry that could easily be cut off both by the enemy and the weather. Because of that, a number of river monitors were either constructed or acquired from private owners and armed. They were used on the Pripyat River, as well as its extensive river basin. After the war, some of the ships were returned to their owners, the rest remained on active service and were pressed into the so-called Pinsk Flotilla. In peace-time the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy, as it was officially called, operated on the Pina River (Dnieper‚ÄìBug Canal), as well as on the Pripyat and the Strumie≈Ñ rivers. It served as a mobile reserve of the Border Defense Corps and was to support the front in case of a war with the Soviet Union. Prior to the invasion of Poland, a number of ships of the Riverine Flotilla were moved to the Vistula as a detachment and became Oddzia≈Ç Wydzielony Rzeki Wis≈Çy, better known as the Vistula Flotilla. In the Polish operational plans, the Pinsk flotilla was to form a mobile strategic reserve of the Polish Army in the area and was to constitute the core of the forces defending the area of the Pinsk Marshes. The Polish commander-in-chief and Marshal of Poland, Edward Rydz- ≈ömig≈Çy, forecast that the area would be used for a last stand by the Polish Army, where it would await the relief on the western front from Poland's allies. However the Invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939 made the plans obsolete. During actions against the Soviets and the Germans, most of the ships were scuttled by their crews to avoid capture. In 1939-40 most of them were refloated, repaired, rearmed and included in the Soviet Pinsk Naval Flotilla (1940). They took an active part in battles of World War II but were mostly destroyed in 1941.

Jerrabomberra consists of three sections, The Park, The Heights, and Lakeview. The Park and the Heights are divided by Edwin Land Parkway. At the , Jerrabomberra had a population of 9,508, up from 9,420 in 2011, and 8,747 people in 2006. Jerrabomberra is derived from the local Aboriginal place name meaning \\"Youngsters' Meeting Place\\". \\"Jerrabomberra\\", an area of what was then called the Limestone Plains, was purchased by John Palmer in 1827, and settled the following year. John Palmer had been a purser on the \\"Sirius\\" in the First Fleet. The area was brought to his attention because he was a brother-in-law of Robert Campbell at \\"Duntroon\\", a property about nine miles (14 km) to the north east. His property served as a centre for the Anglican Church until nearby Queenbeyan (then known by its original Aboriginal, non- Anglicised name Quinbean) was developed. The Palmer family held the property until at least the 1890s, but the property was later sub-divided into smaller farms. In 1987, Jerrabomberra Estates Ltd, with the CEO Director Alex Brinkmeyer, whose sole vision was to create a master planned community for the region, invited Canberra-based accountant Col Alexander and Perth Millionaire Kerry Stokes, who subsequently became shareholders, to partake in this venture to develop Palmer's original land for housing. The first serviced blocks in stage one of the residential release at Jerrabomberra were released in February 1988, ranging in price from $28,000 to $39,000. The new suburb of Jerrabomberra has grown from a resident population of 8 in 1828 to over 8740 at the 2006 census. Jerrabomberra was established with the construction of the first homes in 1988, followed shortly after by the construction of the community centre hall. Jerrabomberra now boasts many community amenities such as four tennis courts, a post office, primary school, bed and breakfast, gym, a Scout group, a lake and various other facilities. Many people in Jerrabomberra work in nearby Queanbeyan but most work in the national capital, Canberra. Jerrabomberra has a shopping centre which contains a Woolworths, Bakers Delight, hairdresser, an Asian restaurant called \\"The Jerra,\\" and other boutique stores. On the same block of land as this shopping centre, there is a pub and a Woolworths service station that opened in late 2005. On 25 February 2006 Jerrabomberra's General Store was burnt down; no other shops were affected despite the extensive damage. On 6 June, extensive rebuilding of the roof of said store was carried out and the store had its iron sheet roof reinstalled on 20 June of that year. In late 2019, a KFC, McDonalds and 7-Eleven service station will open on the western side of Jerrabomberra. The suburb falls within the Federal division of Eden-Monaro, a seat traditionally viewed as a \\"bellwether seat\\" due to its propensity for being won by the party that also won the majority of seats. However, the seat was won by Mike Kelly (Labor) in 2016 in an election narrowly won by the Liberal Party. It is also part of the state seat of Monaro which is held by the National Party's John Barilaro. Jerrabomberra is also represented by an active residents association (JRA) established in October 1990. The Jerrabomberra Residents Association Inc.Jerrabomberra Residents Association Inc. (JRA) endeavours to represent the interests of the Jerrabomberra community at the local, state and federal level in relation to issues directly affecting the Jerrabomberra community.  Geographical Aspects  The Heights is mainly situated on the base of Jerrabomberra Mountain. This mountain divides most of Jerrabomberra from Queanbeyan on the north-east and North Terrace on the north-west. The Park is situated on the plain to the south. This urban area runs down to Jerrabomberra Lake, an artificial lake that drains into Jerrabomberra Creek and is dominated by Cove Island, est. 1992 (an artificial island which consists of eight homes and a central common facility entailing a tennis court, swimming pool and sauna), then sprawls across Cassina Rise on the South. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there 9,508 people in Jerrabomberra. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6% of the population. * 81.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.5% and New Zealand 1.5%. * 86.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Macedonian 1.8%, Italian 1.2%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 31.7%, No Religion 26.8% and Anglican 17.0%. Education and Childcare Jerrabomberra Public School opened in 2002 and now caters for over 800 students K-6. Achieving results above the State average across the curriculum with particular strengths in literacy and numeracy the school is highly regarded and continues to undergo a building expansion program. Some parents choose to send their children to Catholic schools in Queanbeyan and the ACT. While there is no high school within Jerrabomberra the default government school is Karabar High, in Karabar, Queanbeyan. However, the majority of children of high school age go to public or private schools across the border, particularly Campbell High School, St Edmund's College (boys), and Merici College (girls). Jerrabomberra has one day care centre/pre-school named Goodstart Learning Centre.

Following on from their previous albums, Always Now and The Key of Dreams, it marked a major departure in terms of sound and scope. Abandoning their harsh original post- punk sound the band embarked upon a new journey into the realms of electronic and dance music, with the help of Bernard Sumner of New Order who co-produced the album at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, Wales. The album features subtle yet warm and atmospheric electronic tracks, such as \\"The Process\\" and \\"Inspiration\\", as well as the Hi-NRG-style \\"Looking from a Hilltop\\" and the lighter synth-pop of \\"Reflection\\". \\"Looking from a Hilltop\\" was remixed by Bernard Sumner and Donald Johnson of A Certain Ratio for single release, with the lengthy \\"Megamix\\" version becoming an underground club hit, later sampled by both electronic dance music artists Orbital and the Shamen, and also described as \\"legendary\\" by Pitchfork Media.http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15963-fac-dance-factory- records-12-mixes-rarities-1980-1987/ It was also the first track on Factory Records dance retrospective FAC.

The regiment consisted of four troops from Connecticut, one troop each largely from Massachusetts and New Jersey, and two companies of light infantry.  Military action  The regiment saw action at the Battle of Woodbridge, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Kingston, Battle of Schoharie, The Battle of The Flocky (site of the first cavalry charge on American soil), Battle of Paoli, Battle of Whitemarsh, Battle of Morrisania, Battle of Saratoga, Battle of Germantown, and the Battle of Yorktown. The unit almost never served as a whole. Usually individual troops were assigned as necessary. The regiment performed numerous raids from whaleboats against British and Loyalist installations on Long Island. Some of the successful raids captured Fort St. George, Ft. Slongo and Lloyd's Neck, Long Island. Elements from the unit comprised Washington's personal bodyguard. In 1778, when Loyalist agents and a crack British commando team shadowed Washington for weeks with the intention of kidnapping him, they had to abandon the operation because, according to the British Intelligence dispatches, \\"The 2nd Dragoons are (always) with him.\\" The 2nd Dragoons also guarded John Andre during his incarceration, trial and subsequent execution in Nyack, New York. The regiment's main patrol areas during the war were in Southern Connecticut and New York, where they intercepted British supplies and fought off bands of Loyalist partisans who preyed on local citizens. This duty earned them the nickname \\"Watchdogs of the Highlands\\". They also earned the sobriquet \\"Washington's Eyes\\", likely because of their spy work. Major Benjamin Tallmadge became a spy master who ran one of the most successful spy rings of the war, able to infiltrate the British military command in New York city.  After the war  On January 1, 1781, the regiment was reorganized by the dismounting of two of its six troops and re-designated the 2nd Legionary Corps. The regiment was furloughed June 9, 1783, at Newburgh, New York and discharged on November 20, 1783, by proclamation of General Washington. The 2nd Light Dragoons are prominent in Colonel John Trumbull's paintings of the American Revolution.

The hardcover edition was published in November 2000 by Random House Canada. The writing was favourably received and the book was short-listed for the Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing. With numerous interviews and extensive research behind it, the book presents biographies of three Canadians in United Nations roles in the 1990s: Rom√©o Dallaire (the \\"lion\\"), Lewis MacKenzie (the \\"fox\\"), and Louise Arbour (the \\"eagle\\"). The book praises Dallaire's commitment to his peacekeeping mission, but is critical of MacKenzie, who is depicted as being ignorant of the Bosnian political situation. In response to Off's portrayal of him, MacKenzie considered suing for libel, but opted not to. The book praises Arbour's efforts at building the legitimacy of International Criminal Tribunals and her efforts in indicting alleged war criminals from the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia. Through these biographies, the book addresses themes of morality and UN effectiveness. Background Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Carol Off began research to write a biography of Louise Arbour. Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron, she broadened the book's scope to include profiles of Rom√©o Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie. Along with her research assistant Sian Cansfield, they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews, including with the three subjects. For the historical background on Rwanda, she consulted the works of G√©rard Prunier, Philip Gourevitch, Alison Des Forges, and the Human Rights Watch. For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, she consulted, amongst others, the works of Noel Malcolm, David Rieff, Roy Gutman. Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre, the 45-year-old author wrote the book in the spring and summer of 2000. Content Rom√©o Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, served as the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along information to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non- governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. With the media reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how little the general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.Off, 11‚Äî119. Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, served in the Sarajevo division of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated to keep the peace in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention.Off, 123‚Äî238. Louise Arbour began her job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was unexpectedly selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, a head of state, indicted and arrested.Off, 261‚Äî358. Style The book is divided into four sections: one for each biography and one to provide background context for the conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia. There are also sections entitled Introduction, Conclusion, Acknowledgments, Source Notes, and Index. The three biographies of the Canadians focus on their involvement in international conflicts through the United Nations, but also includes aspects of their backgrounds and follow events after they leave the UN. In the profiles Off avoids describing places and events but provides a chapter to \\"a Grapes of Wrath-style description of her two locales\\". The biographies compare and contrast the strategy and effect of each person's approach to their mission. One reviewer compared the profiles of Dallaire and MacKenzie to Suetonius's biographies of Athenian generals Nicias and Alcibiades. Suetonius portrayed Nicias as honourable, moderate, and effective but over-shadowed by the more vocal and polarizing Alcibiades. Likewise, Off portrayed Dallaire as the more honourable commander but over-shadowed by the more media savvy and callous MacKenzie. Off's focus on moral choices was called \\"a feminist approach\\" by several members of the Department of National Defence. In the Introduction, Off explains the animal metaphors. Rom√©o Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with an appearance of control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention were based on the cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.Off, 4‚Äî7 Themes Reviewers identified two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong. In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene to stop the genocide. In Yugoslavia, MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers. She identifies the UN as the book's villainOff, 1. and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though one side is clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene. Publication and Reception Random House Canada published the hardcover in November 2000. An excerpt was published in the weekly general interest magazine Saturday Night. It appeared on Maclean's best-seller list for 4 weeks, peaking at #3.*Note: it appeared on the best-seller list in the following issues: Dec 4 at #10, Dec 11 at #8, Dec 25 at #3, and Jan 8 at #6. It did not appear on the Dec 18 list. A Random House imprint, Vintage Canada, published the trade paperback a year later. The Writers' Trust of Canada short-listed the book for its 2000 Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing. Reviewers described Off's writing as strong, clear, and sometimes elegant. Reviewing for the Quill & Quire, Derek Weiler wrote that the book's strength is its \\"informative outlines of [the] conflicts, with gripping and readable summary enhanced by evocative scene- setting.\\" Weiler and other reviewers found the chapters on Arbour, where the narrative slackens, to be the weakest part of the book. While Arbour was pleased with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's critical portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting his point of view concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.

Pre World War I Born to a Russian noble family in Kherson Governorate, Kazakov graduated from Yelizavetgrad cavalry school in 1908. He did his stint in cavalry, but in 1913 he began formal training as a pilot and graduated at the beginning of World War I from Gatchina military aviation school.Kulikov, p. 15. World War I Alexander Kazakov flew on Morane-Saulnier, Spad ‚Äì S–ê2, Nieuport 11 and Nieuport 17 planes and is alleged to have the largest number of victories over enemy aircraft among Imperial Russian Air Force pilots. Unofficially he shot down 32 German and Austro-Hungarian planes, although his official tally is only 20 because only planes crashed in Russian-held territory were counted. Russian military aviation tradition during World War I was different from that of its Western allies and rivals and the individual scores of pilots were considered to be of lesser value compared to their contribution to the overall war effort. On 31 March 1915 Alexander Kazakov successfully repeated the aerial ramming attack first attempted by Pyotr Nesterov, using a Morane- Saulnier G as his piloted projectile. For this bit of daring, he was awarded the Order of Saint Anne, first in the Fourth Class, then in the Third. He was appointed to command of 19th Corps Fighter Detachment in September 1915. Here he had Nieuport 10s and Nieuport 11s to fly. Between 27 June and 21 December 1916, he racked up four more victories to become an ace.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/russia/kozakov.php Retrieved on 8 May 2010. Five months later, Kazakov resumed his winning streak with his sixth victory on 6 May 1917, which was shared with Ernst Leman and Pavel Argeyev. By 25 May, with his eighth win, he switched to a Nieuport 17, which he used henceforth. Between 1915 and 1917 he fought on the Russian front as well as in Romania and participated in the Brusilov Offensive as a commander of 1st Combat Air Group.Ltn. Karl Crome from FFA4b - The Aerodrome Forum at www.theaerodrome.com In January 1918, in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, Kazakov resigned his Russian commission. Russian Civil War During the Russian Civil War Kazakov joined the Slavo-British Allied Legion in Arkhangelsk and fought against the Workers' and Peasants' Red Air Fleet. On 1 August 1918 Kazakov became a major in the Royal Air Force and was appointed to be commanding officer in charge of an aviation squadron of the Slavo-British Allied Legion made up of Sopwith Camel planes. After the British withdrawal from Russia which left the Russian White Army in a desperate situation, Kazakov died in a plane crash during an air show on 1 August 1919 which was performed to boost the morale of the Russian anti-Bolshevik troops. Most witnesses of the incident, including British ace Ira Jones, thought Kazakov committed suicide.

It is a remake of the film Outward Bound (1930), itself based on the 1923 play Outward Bound by Sutton Vane. It is not, as is sometimes claimed, a remake of Fritz Lang's Destiny (original title Der m√ºde Tod). Plot During World War II, a diverse group of people in war-ravaged London book passage for the United States, but Austrian pianist-turned-soldier in the R√©sistance Henry Bergner (Paul Henreid) is unable to join them, for want of an exit permit. Searching the streets for him during a German air raid, his wife Ann (Eleanor Parker) witnesses a bomb obliterate a car full of passengers on their way to the docks. She returns to their apartment to find that Henry has turned on the gas to commit suicide. Despite his opposition, she joins him. Suddenly, the pair find themselves on board a fog-shrouded cruise ship. Ann recognizes the other passengers as those killed in the bombing. The steward, Scrubby (Edmund Gwenn), asks them not to tell the others they are dead; it is better that they come to the realization themselves. At first, the couple is delighted to be together eternally, but find their situation unbearable as they become acquainted with the others. Timid Anglican priest Reverend William Duke (Dennis King) yearns to more actively help others, while American merchant sailor Pete Musick (George Tobias) looks forward to seeing his infant child for the first time. A kind-hearted older woman, Mrs. Midget (Sara Allgood), tells Thomas Prior (John Garfield), a newspaperman, that she would be content with a little place of her own. Prior is the first to learn the truth when he eavesdrops on Henry and Ann, and, spurned by his wealth-seeking actress companion, Maxine Russell (Faye Emerson) in favour of unscrupulous war profiteer Mr. Lingley (George Coulouris), reveals all to the other passengers. Scrubby reveals that they are to be judged by the Examiner. When the Examiner arrives, he is revealed to be the deceased Reverend Tim Thompson (Sydney Greenstreet), someone Duke had known well in life. Duke is given another opportunity in Heaven, as an Examiner-in-training. One by one, the other passengers are judged and sent ashore to their fates. Wealthy Mr. Lingley discovers he can neither bribe nor browbeat his way into Heaven and must pay for the suffering he inflicted. Genevieve and Benjamin Cliveden-Banks (Isobel Elsom and Gilbert Emery) are a mismatched couple. She is a shallow, mercenary social climber, who married him for his wealth and position and was unfaithful. She is at first delighted to learn that she will reside in a castle, but then the Examiner tells her she will live alone. Her husband had suffered his wife's infidelities because he loved her and hoped she would reciprocate, but his love wore out and, when given the choice, declines to join her. Instead, he is to be reunited with his old chums. Prior then barges in, followed by Russell. He is defiant, but she regrets her life choices. She leaves with the hope of redemption. Prior tries to gamble his way into Heaven by rigging a deck of cards, but when his sleight of hand is trumped by the Examiner's powers, he demands oblivion. Instead, he is told that the afterlife will be no different from his life, with one exception: he will no longer be able to hide behind his deceptions; he will not be able to delude himself as to who and what he really is. Mrs. Midget offers to accompany Prior, giving up her cottage and garden in Heaven. The Examiner reveals, after Prior leaves the room, that Mrs. Midget is Prior's mother. She had given him up when he was very young so he could have a better chance in America; being reunited with him is her idea of Heaven. Musick the sailor bemoans not being able to see his family again but is consoled when told he will be reunited with them eventually. Finally, there is the special case of Henry Bergner. Because he committed suicide, he is doomed to remain on the ship for eternity while Ann goes to Heaven. Ann protests that her suicide was voluntary and that nothing will separate her from Henry. Ann refuses to go ashore with the Examiner. Scrubby pleads the matter with the Examiner. Returned to their apartment, Henry finds a window shattered by a bomb blast, letting in fresh air and thwarting their suicide attempt. He revives Ann, and they rejoice at being given back the gift of life.

There are fewer characters in the play and the earlier film, and no one is killed by a bomb, but the plot is essentially the same, as is much of the dialogue. However, because there is no bomb explosion, neither the audience nor the ship passengers are aware that the passengers are dead until well into the play, not even Henry and Ann. The play and earlier film also share a number of other differences from Between Two Worlds, one of them being that Henry and Ann are lovers and Ann cannot obtain a divorce from her husband. When they board the ship, the audience is led to believe that they are running away to be together, and it is not until the end that it is revealed that they tried to commit suicide. The Hays Code, which was not in effect in 1930, when Outward Bound was filmed, prevented Ann and Henry from being depicted as illicit lovers, and instead demanded that they be turned into husband and wife. However, the suicide aspect of the story went unchanged from the original. Paul Henreid wrote in his memoirs that he felt the film was hurt by revealing the characters were dead at the beginning, which \\"took away from the eerie quality of the play.\\" He says director Blatt was \\"a pleasant fellow but inexperienced.\\"Henreid p 166 Media releases Never available on VHS, Between Two Worlds was released by Warner Archive on DVD.

WWI memorial plaque, St. John's Academy, 1922. By 1887 the reorganized St. John's again found itself with enrollment and financial problems, and the trustees looked for someone who could not only turn the school around, but also assume all financial risks. The school was renamed in 1888 to The Manlius School, while the Episcopal Bishop remained as chairman of the board of trustees. This person was Colonel William Verbeck who served as school president until his appointment as New York State Adjutant General on June 1, 1910. Starting with 18 returning students, he raised enrollment to 120 within five years. Effectively by 1914, the school was split into two internal school units, St. John's, the high school and Verbeck Hall, ages 10 to 14. By the time of Verbeck's death in 1930, The Manlius School had become one of the top military schools in the United States. His son, Guido Fridolin Verbeck, succeeded him as commandant of the school. By 1969, rumors had indicated that the school was in financial troubles. = Pebble Hill School = The Pebble Hill School was founded in 1927 as a non-sectarian country day school for boys. A piece of property in the Pebble Hill area of Orville (now part of the Town of DeWitt) was purchased , and the school opened on September 20, 1927, with an enrollment of 49 students. Prior to 1929, all classes at Pebble Hill were held in what still is known as \\"the Farmhouse.\\" This building is the basis for MPH's logo and now houses the school's administrative offices. Built in 1832, the MPH Farmhouse is one of the oldest buildings in the Town of DeWitt. = Merger = \\"The Barn,\\" MPH's performing arts building; St. John's Academy memorial (foreground). Enrollment at military schools fell off in the late 1960s, as disenchantment grew with the Vietnam War. The Manlius School did not escape this trend, and financial difficulties again were on the school's horizon. At the same time, Pebble Hill was running out of room for the many students who were enrolled there. In 1970 the two schools merged to become Manlius Pebble Hill School. At first the newly merged school used both campuses, with the DeWitt campus used for the Lower and Middle Schools, and the Manlius campus for the Upper School. However, by 1973 it became impractical to run two campuses. The Manlius campus was shut down beginning with the 1973-74 school year and all classes were moved to the DeWitt campus; the Class of 1974 was the last whose commencement was in Knox Hall, on the Manlius campus. The Manlius campus was sold in 1979 to a private developer.  Today  MPH's new gymnasium, arts, and administration building, 2018 Today Manlius Pebble Hill School has an enrollment of 314 students and counts members of both predecessor schools as well as those who attended MPH among its more than 4,600 alumni. It is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools, of which MPH is a founding institutional member. In 2019, the school is ranked by Niche.com as the #1 private school in the Syracuse, New York, area.\\"Manlius Pebble Hill School,\\" Niche.com. Accessed: 5 March 2019.

The regiment saw action at the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Guilford Court House. The regiment was surprised on the night of September 27, 1778, while sleeping in barns near Old Tappan, New Jersey, in close proximity to British positions. Referred to by the Continentals as the \\"Baylor Massacre\\", at least 67 men were made casualties and 70 horses killed. Among the captured was the regimental commander, Lt. Col. George Baylor, who was replaced on November 20, 1778, by Lt. Col. William Washington, transferred from the 4th Continental Light Dragoons. In 1779, while recruiting and remounting, the regiment rescued James Wilson during the \\"Fort Wilson Riot\\". The 3rd CLD was posted to the Southern department on November 1, 1779. Losses of 15 killed, 17 wounded, and 100 men captured along with 83 horses in a night attack by British Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton on April 14, 1780, led to the unofficial amalgamation of the regiment with the 1st Continental Light Dragoons, commonly known as the \\"1st and 3rd Light Dragoons\\" as Washington deferred to his friend and senior, Lt. Col. Anthony White, whom he had served under in the 4th CLD. Washington resumed command of the unit on May 6, 1780, when it was attacked on the Santee River and White captured. In the 1781 campaign, Washington and his men distinguished themselves in mounted charges at the Battle of Cowpens in January, the Battle of Guilford Court House in March, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September. At Eutaw Springs Washington was pinned under his fallen mount, bayoneted, and captured. Captain William Parsons, the senior surviving officer, commanded the corps until Lt-Col. Baylor was exchanged in June 1782 and resumed command. When the companies of the 4th CLD were parceled out during the siege of Yorktown, the 1st and 3rd accepted its few remaining mounted troopers. The regiment was officially merged into the 1st Legionary Corps on November 2, 1782, with the consolidated unit of five troops designated the 1st Legionary Corps. A member of the 3rd Continental Dragoons was Maryland Congressman Philip Stuart.

For related developments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, see Russia and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Zionism The official Soviet ideological position on Zionism condemned the movement as akin to bourgeois nationalism. Lenin, claiming to be deeply committed to egalitarian ideals and universality of all humanity, rejected Zionism as a reactionary movement, \\"bourgeois nationalism\\", \\"socially retrogressive\\", and a backward force that deprecates class divisions among Jews. Soviets believed that the main objective of the Zionist movement was to bring about a mass immigration of Jews into Israel from countries where they had been scattered among the general population, with a special emphasis placed on the Soviet Union. Under Stalin's rule, he initially accepted a limited emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union into Israel in order to invest in what he hoped for would be a socialist Israel. Those plans and other Soviet foreign policy indeed ended up having an impact, with Socialist parties like the Mapai and Mapam dominating the political landscape of Israel until the 1970s. However, the later exodus of Jews from the Soviet Union can be interpreted as a brain drain that would affect the Soviet nation. Establishment of the State of Israel For Soviet foreign policy decision-makers, pragmatism took precedence over ideology. Without changing its official anti-Zionist stance, from late 1944, until 1948 and even later, Joseph Stalin adopted a pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would accelerate the decline of British influence in the Middle East. The USSR began to support Zionism at the UN during the 1947 UN Partition Plan debate. It preferred a Jewish‚ÄìArab binational state. But if this proved impossible it indicated that it would support partition and a Jewish state. On 14 May 1947, the Soviet ambassador Andrei Gromyko announced: :\\"As we know, the aspirations of a considerable part of the Jewish people are linked with the problem of Palestine and of its future administration. This fact scarcely requires proof. ... During the last war, the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering. ... : The United Nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference, since this would be incompatible with the high principles proclaimed in its Charter. ... : The fact that no Western European State has been able to ensure the defence of the elementary rights of the Jewish people and to safeguard it against the violence of the fascist executioners explains the aspirations of the Jews to establish their own State. It would be unjust not to take this into consideration and to deny the right of the Jewish people to realize this aspiration.\\" UN Debate Regarding the Special Committee on Palestine: Gromyko Statement. 14 May 1947 77th Plenary Meeting Document A/2/PV.77 Shortly after this speech, the Soviet media temporarily stopped publishing anti-Zionist material. It followed this policy and gave support to the UN plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine, which led to the founding of the State of Israel. On May 17, 1948, three days after Israel declared independence, the Soviet Union legally recognized it de jure, becoming the first country to grant de jure recognition to the Jewish state. In addition to the diplomatic support, arms from Czechoslovakia, part of the Soviet bloc, were crucial to Israel in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Effects of the Cold War The USSR soon switched sides in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. After it tried to maintain a policy of friendship with Israel at first, abstaining from and allowing the passage of Security Council Resolution 95 in September 1951, which chastised Egypt for preventing ships bound for Israeli ports from travelling through the Suez Canal, asking them to cease interference on shipping for political purposes, in the latter part of 1953 it began to side with the Arabs in armistice violation discussions in the Security Council. As late as December, 1953, the Soviets were the first state to instruct their envoy to present his credentials to the President of Israel in Jerusalem, the Israeli annexation of and usage as the capital being controversial. This move was followed by other nations and strongly protested by the Arabs as \\"flouting\\" UN resolutions. On January 22, 1954 the Soviets vetoed a Security Council resolution (relating to a Syrian‚ÄìIsraeli water dispute) because of Arab objections for the first time, and soon after vetoed even a mild resolution expressing \\"grave concern\\" that Egypt was not living up to Security Council Resolution 95. This elicited Israeli complaints that resolutions recognizing its rights could not pass because of the Soviet veto policy. At the same time, however, the Soviets did support the Israeli demand for direct negotiations with the Arab states, which the Arab states opposed. Like the earlier deal with Israel, a major episode in the Soviet relation to the conflict was the Czech arms deal with Egypt for arms from the Soviet bloc in August 1955. After the mid-50s and throughout the remainder of the Cold War the Soviets unequivocally supported various Arab regimes over Israel. With Israel emerging as a close Western ally, Zionism raised Communist leadership fears of internal dissent and opposition arising from the substantial segment of party members who were Jewish, leading to the declaration of Zionism as an ideological enemy. During the later parts of the Cold War Soviet Jews were persecuted as possible traitors, Western sympathisers, or a security liability. Jewish organizations were closed down, with the exception of a few token synagogues. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years: ordinary Soviet Jews were often not being allowed to enter universities or hired to work in certain professions. Many were barred from participation in the government, and had to bear being openly humiliated. The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and Americans for \\"racist imperialism.\\" The meaning of the term Zionism was defined by the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union: \\"the main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism... overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR.\\" –°–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è) (Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. 1969‚Äì1978) Howard Sachar described the allegations of global Jewish conspiracy resurrected during the Soviet \\"anti-Zionist\\" campaign in the wake of the Six- Day War: > \\"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign > against Zionism as a \\"world threat.\\" Defeat was attributed not to tiny > Israel alone, but to an \\"all-powerful international force.\\" ...

Yuri > Ivanov's Beware: Zionism, a book essentially replicated The Protocols of the > Elders of Zion, was given nationwide coverage.\\" A similar picture was drawn by Paul Johnson: the mass media \\"all over the Soviet Union portrayed the Zionists (i.e. Jews) and Israeli leaders as engaged in a world-wide conspiracy along the lines of the old Protocols of Zion. It was, Sovietskaya Latvia wrote 5 August 1967, an 'international Cosa Nostra with a common centre, common programme and common funds'\\". The Israeli government was also referred to as a \\"terrorist regime\\" which \\"has raised terror to the level of state politics.\\" Even regarding the Entebbe hostage crisis, Soviet media reported: \\"Israel committed an act of aggression against Uganda, assaulting the Entebbe airport.\\"Newspaper Novoye Vremya, cited in edition V√§lispanoraam 1981 (Foreign Panorama 1981), (Tallinn, 1982) p.156 In March 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became the Secretary General of the CPSU and in April he declared perestroika. It took more than six years before Moscow consented to restore diplomatic relations with Israel on October 19, 1991, just 2 months prior to the collapse of the USSR. Six-Day War Although the Soviet Union had adopted a foreign policy of d√©tente, easing of hostility, in the mid 1960s, it played a key role in the instigation of the Six-Day War in Israel. Soviet Union pursued d√©tente because of the need for economic stability in order to create domestic change. Furthermore, as stated in Brezhnev's foreign policy speech given to the central committee on December 1966, a key goal of Soviet foreign policy was the consolidation of the post- World War II borders. Thus, it was believed that the Soviet Union should be cautious in its foreign engagement in an attempt to prevent any political instability from reaching Europe. In the 1950s the Soviet Union became allies with Egypt and Syria due to the \\"Anglo-French debacle at Suez, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, and the use of the Soviet rouble.\\" Later Egypt and Syria developed a defense treaty, in which if one of them declared war on Israel the other would get involved.Laron (2010), p. 175. Soviet Relations with Israel had declined since Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. When Levi Eshkol became the Israeli prime minister in 1963, Moscow was nervous, because they weren't sure what direction Eshkol would take in his foreign policy, specifically Soviet-Israeli relations.Laron (2010), p. 166. Initially things seemed to be going better with representatives from Soviet and Israeli governments meeting in June 1965 and January 1966. However relations soon fell apart. On February 23, 1966 Syria had a military coup, in which the new regime Neo-Ba‚Äôath took a more radical position towards Israel, both in rhetoric and action, supporting Palestinian guerilla activity against Israel.Laron (2010), p. 168. Disagreements about Israel led to the development of tensions in the Soviet‚ÄìSyrian relationship, eventually leading to the Soviets' delaying their arms shipments to Syria, and slowing down on the previously promised Euphrates dam loan.Laron (2010), p. 169. In the 1960s there were numerous clashes between the Syrians and Israelis on the Syria‚ÄìIsrael border. In October 1966 Palestinian guerilla operation against Israel intensified. One of the most serious of these incidents occurred on April 7, 1967 when Israel destroyed seven of Syria's modern Russian MIG planes. Although the Soviets provided the Syrian army with weapons, they made it clear that they wanted to avoid war.Laron (2010), p. 171. After several more Palestinian guerilla operations, Soviet foreign ministry adopted a \\"two pronged approach\\", demanding that Israel stop its aggressive policy toward the Arab countries and telling Iraq, Jordan and Syria that a warning had been sent out and explaining that the Soviet government disproved of any Chinese involvement in the Middle East and the actions of the Palestinian guerrilla organizations.Laron (2010), p. 172. As tensions between Israel and Syria increased, Israel felt the threat of force was the only deterrent left.Bose, 92. On May 12 the Politburo was told that the IDF had formulated a large-scale attack on Syria and was simply waiting for a good time to begin it.Laron (2010), p. 176. A day later, on May 13, 1967 the Soviet's gave the Egyptian President, Gamal Abd al-Nasser an intelligence report that claimed there were Israeli troops gathering on the Syrian border.Bose, 92. Dmitri Chuvakhin, Soviet ambassador to Israel, refused an Israeli Invitation to visit the border in order to disprove the report. On May 14, Nasser sent his chief of staff, General Mohamed Fawzi to the border to investigate the report, and was told there were no Israeli troop concentrations.Golan, 58. Although, Nasser knew that the Soviet report was wrong, he perhaps interpreted it to indicate Soviet support of an Egyptian offensive towards Israel.Golan, 59. On May 15, Nasser sent the Egyptian army to Sinai and on May 18, 1967 Nasser requested that the U.N. Emergency Force (UNEF) withdraw from Egypt.Bose, 92. Furthermore, on May 22 he closed the Tiran straits to Israeli ships. The Israelis interpreted the closing of the straits of Tiran as an act of war, and attacked Egypt on June 5, 1967, destroying hundreds of airplanes.Bose, 106. Russia reacted to Israel's offensive in two ways. Firstly it severed diplomatic relations with Israel and threatened sanctions if fighting with Syria did not cease immediately. Secondly, it told the White House that unless Israel stopped military operations, the Soviet Union would get involved. In the following six days Israel achieved massive victories, until the war ended on June 10, 1967 with a cease-fire.Bose, 108 The role the USSR played in the June 1967 war, between the State of Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, remains fiercely debated. Some scholars have argued that Moscow started the war in order to further its position in the area and increase Arab reliance on Soviet aid. Expanding on the notion that a key goal of the Soviet Union in the Middle East in the 1960s was to expand its military presence through the procurement of both naval and air bases.Golan, 59. Furthermore, the Soviets chose to involve Egypt in the conflict due to the fear that an incident between Syria and Israel would likely lead to Syria's defeat. Others claim it was due to miscalculations and the Soviets' lack of control over the Arabs. Another theory was that Moscow was attempting to use the Middle East in order to divert attention from Vietnam.Ro‚ÄôI, 269. Recently a theory has emerged that claims that the main reason for the Soviet move was to demolish Israel's nuclear development before it had obtained a working atomic weapon. The Soviets also viewed Israel's victory in the 1967 war as damaging to themselves because this one nation had been able to destroy multiple Arab countries that had been supplied with Soviet military hardware, as well as Soviet military expertise to Egyptian and Syrian advisers. The United States' absolute support towards Israel further exacerbated relations between the Soviet Union and Israel which furthered the Soviet Union's decision to break off diplomatic ties to Israel. Other factors included the fact that Israel was considered to be an actively belligerent state towards its neighboring Arab countries that held prominence in the Soviet Union's Middle East agenda.

The restaurants are especially known for their spit-roasted chicken, shawarma, falafel, tahini, and a \\"secret\\" garlic sauce. History The first Zankou Chicken opened in 1962 in the Bourj Hammoud neighborhood of Beirut, Lebanon, by Armenian Vartkes Iskenderian and his family. The chain was established within the United States in 1983 by his son, Mardiros Iskenderian, after the family immigrated to Los Angeles, California. After considering opening a dry cleaning business or selling men's suits, Iskenderian recognized a lack of restaurants catering to the growing Mediterranean immigrant population in Los Angeles. This included Armenian and Lebanese compatriots who fled Lebanon during the civil war. The first restaurant in Los Angeles opened in a section of East Hollywood called Little Armenia https://laist.com/2007/07/10/neighborhood_pr.php and is located at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Normandie Avenue. The restaurant is especially known for its thick, paste-like garlic sauce, created by Vartkes' wife, Markrid and widely imitated. In 1991 the family agreed to divide the business when Mardiros wanted to open additional restaurants. The new restaurants would be owned by Mardiros, while the original Sunset and Normandie store would be owned by his parents and two sisters. Vartkes Iskenderian died in 1992. Since opening, Zankou Chicken has expanded and includes the following locations in the greater Los Angeles area: East Hollywood, West Hollywood, West Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, Toluca Lake, Van Nuys, Montebello, and Anaheim. (The original location and Montebello locations are not listed on the website; Rita Iskenderian owns the website and doesn't include them.)https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-2010-mar-18-la-fi-zankou18-2010mar18-story.html On January 14, 2003, after a heated argument, Zankou Chicken owner Mardiros Iskenderian shot and killed his sister, Dzovig Marjik, and his mother Margarit Iskenderian; he then took his own life in a double-murder suicide. It is believed that Iskenderian was in the late stages of colon and brain cancer, which might have affected his mental faculties. The repercussions of this event, and the lasting division of the brand into two family factions, impeded the continuing growth of the business despite the restaurants' popularity. In the California Court of Appeal case Iskenderian v. Iskenderian,Iskenderian v. Iskenderian, 144 Cal. App. 4th 1162 (2006) Mardiros Iskenderian's widow Rita unsuccessfully sought to attain sole control of the Zankou Chicken trademark.

Djursland protrudes into the Kattegat sea, as part of the larger peninsula of Jutland, which itself extends from the Central European continent. Djursland comprises the two municipalities of Norddjurs and Syddjurs. The only larger city on Djursland is Gren√•, but both Randers and Aarhus are close-by. Agriculture and fishing has been the mainstay of the rural culture here for millennia. There are many prehistoric relics of the past on Djursland, reaching back to the earliest cultures of the Nordic Stone Age. Djursland is a popular place for recreation in the summer and has several activities for tourists to offer. It attracts both Danes and foreigners alike and tourism is a major job and economic contributor on Djursland nowadays. Since 2009, a larger area of Djursland has been part of the Mols Bjerge National Park, connecting several previously disconnected protections. Climate Djursland has a mild, temperate coastal climate, influenced by the North Atlantic Current. Westerly and southwesterly winds prevail. The yearly precipitation is 700 mm,Den Store Danske Encyclop√¶di making Djursland well suited for agriculture, like the rest of Denmark. The average summer temperature is 16 degrees Celsius. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0.5 degrees. The predominant crops are barley, wheat, canola, and in recent years corn, growing at its northern range, even though the average temperature has fallen 0.2 degrees over the last 60 years in Denmark. A little over 10% of Djursland is covered with forest (plantations) and the most common trees are Norway spruce, Scots pine and beech. Population The population density of Djursland is 42 inhabitants per km2, compared to 126 for Denmark as a whole. Neighboring Germany to the south has 230 inhabitants per km2, England to the west 407, and Sweden to the east of Denmark 21 inhabitants per km2. Denmark has 5.6 million inhabitants, of whom 80,000 live in Djursland. Landscape Djursland's 50 km eastern coastline is stony, open and walkable Gren√• Beach Even on hilly Djursland, only a few of the hills rise above 70 metres above sea level and none higher than 140 metres. As in the rest of Denmark, excluding the remote island of Bornholm, there is no surface bedrock - neither above nor below the sea -, as Djursland's landscapes were formed by complex and non-uniform glacial movements with related meltwater flows, in the span of the last three ice ages. Coastlines: Djursland is surrounded by sea on three sides, and has three corresponding distinct types of coastline. Variation is a common denominator for Djursland's coastal geography, as well as the inland geography. *North Coast - The 35 km northern coastline of Djursland comprise all-sand beaches with shallow waters throughout. It stretches east from a shallow delta-like marshy coast where the outlet of Denmark's largest river, the Guden√•, enters Randers Fjord and the sea. The north coast beaches are child-friendly for bathing and paddling, while swimming depths are reached about a hundred metres from the shores. The shallow water heats up quickly in summer. Fishing for flatfish is good, but it takes a boat to reach sufficient fishing depth. *East Coast - The 50 km coastline facing Sweden (approximately 100 km to the east across the Kattegat) is stony. The east coast has sufficient swimming depth close to the shore within 5‚Äì20 metres from land. The east coast is known among anglers and scuba divers. There are two major exceptions to the stony coastline. One is at the Cliffs of Sangstrup and Karlby where a 5 km stretch of coast consists of up to 12 m high limestone cliffs, similar to the Cliffs of Dover but on a smaller scale. The second exception is Gren√• Beach, a sandy 5 km long beach with dunes. The beach lies by the coastal town, Gren√•, and is a popular bathing beach. Here and there on Djursland's eastern coast, there are steep inclines caused by active coastal erosion, such as at Gjerrild and Rugaard. *South Coast - The southern coastline of Djursland is dominated by bights and inlets, with varied stony and sandy stretches and mixed depth gradients. It is always possible to find bights and coves in shelter for any wind direction within a short driving distance. There are a number of sandy bathing beaches here. The tide is moderate around Djursland, with a difference between ebb and flow usually less than 30 cm. Central Djursland Border hills at Kolind Sound The Kolindsund or Sound of Kolind is a dried-out lake that stretches 30 km east-west into central Djursland. The area was a lake until 1870, and a saltwater sound until the Middle Ages,Kolindsund, Finn Hansen making it possible to sail into central Djursland. Sand drift closed the estuary to the sea, Kattegat. The lakebed is fertile farmland with constant high yields of wheat and grass seed. The northern side of the sound is flanked by 25 km of border hills down to the lakebed contributing to the characteristics of the landscape. The sound is drained by two pumping stations lifting the water up into a Northern Canal which flows into a river that runs through the centre of the town, Gren√•, before entering the sea, between Gren√•‚Äôs marina and seaport. Kolind Sound lies 2 metres below sea level, while the pumping elevation at the pumping stations is 5 metres. The sound is flanked by canals that are popular among anglers. Sea trout is a particularly common catch, as are pike, perch and bream. Southern Djursland View of Ellemandsbjerg in southern Djursland South of Kolind Sound lies a sandy ice-age floodplain housing Djursland's airport, Aarhus Airport, which serves Denmark's second largest city, Aarhus (pop. 319,094), 41 km southwest of the airport. Mols: Going further south one enters an area with the most abrupt hills in Djursland, the Mols Bjerge, ending at the bights and inlets of southern Djursland. Mols contains Mols Bjerge National Park, which includes coastlines, parts of seabed, the town of Ebeltoft, and a hilly non-farmed landscape with views over the bights and inlets of southern Djursland. The non-farming part of the park is maintained as an open post-ice-age landscape. This is done by grazing and cutting down excessive tree growth that would otherwise cause natural, and dense, forestation, obstructing views and accessibility. The national park was established in 2009, mostly on privately owned land. Establishing the park did not involve buying or expropriating land, but an intention to strengthen information about nature-related issues in the area, and to widen use and access to the park. The main bays, bights and coves on southern Djursland are the Bay of Aarhus, the Bight of Begtrup, the Bight of Knebel, the Bight of Egens and the Bight of Ebeltoft. Northern Djursland Reed-covered outlet at the delta of Randers Fjord The area north of Kolind Sound (Kolindsund), 15 km north up to the coast, consists mainly of low hills with predominantly sandy soil that is quite good farmland. Northern Djursland is the most forested and least inhabited part of Djursland. Randers Fjord: The northeastern corner of northern Djursland is bounded by Randers Fjord, a long and narrow outlet through which Denmark's largest river, the Guden√•, enters the Kattegat. The land bordering Randers Fjord is in some places marshy plains covered in reeds, which to some extent are cut and used for traditional thatching of house roofs. Two small car ferries cross Randers Fjord at Udbyh√∏j and Voer. The smallest one, at Voer, is a cable ferry that carries under 10 cars at a time on the open deck. The crossings over the fjord are under half a kilometre long. Forests Eye Lake in Skrams√∏ Forest Djursland has three main wooded areas: *Emmedsbo forest area to the northeast. *L√∏venholm Skov in the west- central part. *Skrams√∏ Plantage to the south. These three woods each have an area of approximately 50 km2. Wildlife in Djursland includes four species of deer, with roe deer the smallest and most common, and red deer the largest. The two others are fallow deer and sika deer. Hares, foxes, badgers and pheasants are common. In recent years, ravens have become more widespread, just as some species of large birds of prey that had not bred here for many decades, such as kites, have reinhabited Djursland. Like Denmark as a whole, Djursland has no large predators such as wolves or bears. Towns Gren√• Marina Gren√• ‚Äì a seaport on the central eastern coast ‚Äì is the largest town in Djursland with a population of 14,454.Danmarks Statistik Gren√• has ferry connections to Varberg in Sweden and the island of Anholt. There is a commercial seaport that has expanded in recent years. The 5 km sandy Gren√• beach is important for the area's tourism, with a hinterland of summer cottages with many rentals. As elsewhere in the western world, Gren√•'s manufacturing industry has stagnated. Development of tourism and educational institutions is sought to play a larger role for the economy in the future. Gren√• is a regional shopping centre for central-eastern Djursland. Ebeltoft, at the Bight of Ebeloft in southeastern Djursland, is the second-largest town, with 7,528 inhabitants. Tourism is the single most important source of income. There are over 8000 summer cottages in the Ebeltoft areaHomepage Ebeltoft Municipality with many rentals. Tourism in the Ebeltoft area is in part based on a picturesque historical and rural town centre, and the hilly coastal landscapes of Mols with accessible coastline and beaches with many bights and inlets. Ebeltoft is connected by ferry to Zealand, the eastern main island of Denmark on which the capital, Copenhagen (pop. 1,237,280), is located. Smaller towns in Djursland with shopping centres include R√∏nde, Hornslet, Auning, M√∏rke, Ryomg√•rd, Kolind, Alling√•bro, Fjellerup Strand, Pindstrup and Glesborg. Tourism There is public access to all coastlines in Denmark by law, here at the Bight of Begtrup, southern Djursland Djursland has 22 registered sandy beaches,Kystkort Djursland each with adjacent areas of summer rentals and cottages. The beaches here are protected from the tides, strong currents, and the large waves typical of the Atlantic shores. The water quality is controlled and good, due to national waste water treatment standards, and a low population density. The low population density of 51 inhabitants per km2, as compared to Germany's 230 and England's 410, is a contributing factor in making Djursland attractive for visitors. Another factor is climate: Djursland is less rainy than England, and rarely suffers from the sweltering summer heat that can be a challenge in Mediterranean coastal regions. Foreign tourists come primarily from Germany, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Ebeltoft also gets many Danish tourists. Germans are known for visiting outside the high season, and for seeking landscape- and nature-oriented attractions of the coast and countryside. Angling, for fish like sea trout, plaice or garfish, is a common pastime, as are diving and scuba diving, particularly on the steeper east coast. By law, the coastlines of Denmark are accessible to everybody. Good accessibility to the coasts of Djursland is probably the single most important factor favoring tourism in the area. There is a distribution of marinas along the coasts of Djursland and nearby shores, generating a well- developed yacht tourism in the summer. Djursland also contains the major attractions of Djurs Sommerland, Ree Park ‚Äì Ebeltoft Safari, Scandinavian Wildlife Park and Kattegatcentret, attracting tourists throughout the year, but mostly in the summertime.

Origination generally includes all the steps from taking a loan application up to disbursal of funds (or declining the application). For mortgages, there is a specific mortgage origination process. Loan servicing covers everything after disbursing the funds until the loan is fully paid off. Loan origination is a specialized version of new account opening for financial services organizations. Certain people and organizations specialize in loan origination. Mortgage brokers and other mortgage originator companies serve as a prominent example. There are many different types of loans. For more information on loan types, see the loan and consumer lending articles. Steps involved in originating a loan vary by loan type, various kinds of loan risk, regulator, lender policy etc.  Application process  Applications for loans may be made through several different channels and the length of the application process, from initial application to funding, means that different organizations may use various channels for customer interactions over time. In general, loan applications may be split into five distinct types: * Agent (branch-based) * Agent assisted (telephone-based) * Broker sale (third-party sales agent) * Self-service * Online Application Retail loans and mortgages are typically highly competitive products that may not offer a large margin to their providers, but through high volume sales can be highly profitable. The business model of the individual financial institution and the products they offer therefore affect the decision of which application model they will offer = Agent assisted (branch-based) loan application = The typical types of financial services organizations offering loans through the face to face channel have a long-term investment in 'brick and mortar' branches. Typically these are: * Banks * Credit unions * Building societies The appeal to customers of the loan offered directly in branches is the often long-standing relationship that a customer may have with the institution, the appearance of trustworthiness this type of institution has, and the perception that holding a larger portfolio of products with a single organization may lead to better terms. From a bank's standpoint, cross-selling products to current customers offers an effective marketing opportunity, and agents in branches may be trained to handle the sale of many different types of financial products. In a branch, customers typically sit with a sales agent who will assist the customer in completing the application form, selecting appropriate product options (such as payment terms and rates), collecting required documentation (new account opening compliance requirements must be met at this stage), selecting add-on products (such as payment protection insurance), and eventually signing a completed application. Dependent on the institution and product being offered, the application may be completed on a paper application form, or directly into an online application through the agent's desktop system. In either case, this phase of application is mostly concerned with the accurate capture of customer's details, and does not incorporate any of the background decisioning work required to assess the suitability of the customer and the risk of default, or the due diligence that must be performed to mitigate risk of fraud and money laundering activities. A major complexity for the branch origination channel is making the process simple enough that sales agents can be easily trained to handle many different products, while ensuring that the many due diligence and disclosure requirements of the financial and banking regulators regionally are met. Many back-office functions of loan origination continue from this point and are described in the Processing section below. = Self- service loan application = * Self-service web applications are taken in a variety of ways, and the state of this business has evolved over time * Print and fax applications or pre-qualification forms. Some financial institutions still use these. ** Print, write or type data into the form, send it to the financial institution ** Form fill on the web, print, and send to the financial institution (not much better) * Web forms filled out and saved by the applicant on the web site, that are then sent to or retrieved (securely, presumably) by the financial institution * True web applications with interfaces to a loan origination system on the back end ** Many of the early solutions had a lot of the same problems as general forms (bad work flows, trying to handle all manner of loan types in one form) * Wizard-style applications that are very intuitive and don't ask superfluous questions Jobs the online application should perform: # Present required disclosures, comply with various lending regulations) # Be compliant with security requirements (such as Multi-Factor Authentication) where applicable. # Collect the necessary applicant data ## Exactly what is needed varies by loan type. The application should not ask for data the applicant doesn't absolutely have to provide to get to a prequalification decision for the loan type(s) they seek. ## The application should pre-fill demographic data if the applicant is an existing client and has logged in. # Make it easy, quick, and friendly for the applicant (so they actually complete the application and don't abandon) # Get a current credit report # Prequalify (auto-decision) the application and return a quick response to the applicant. Typically this would be approved subject to stipulations, referred to the financial institution, declined (many FIs shy away from this preferring to refer any application that can't be automatically pre-approved.)  Processing  = Decisions and credit risk = The mortgage business consists of a few people: the borrower, the lender, and sometimes the mortgage broker. The people that originate the loans are usually the mortgage broker or the lender. Depending if the borrower has credit worthiness, then he/she can be qualified for a loan. The norm qualifying FICO score is not a static number. Lender guidelines and mitigating factors determine this number. Recent changes in the market and industry have made stated-income and stated-asset loans a thing of the past and full income and asset documentation is now required from the majority of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed mortgage securities. Not only does one's credit score affect their qualification, the fact of the matter also lies in the question, \\"Can I (the borrower) afford this mortgage?\\" In most cases the borrower can afford their mortgage. However, some borrowers seek to incorporate their unsecured debt into their mortgage (secured debt). They seek to pay off the debt that is outstanding in amount. These debts are called \\"liabilities\\", these liabilities are calculated into a ratio that lenders use to calculate risk. This ratio is called the \\"debt-to-income ratio\\" (DTI). If the borrower has excessive debt that he/she wishes to pay off, and that ratio from those debts exceeds a limit of DTI, then the borrower has to either pay off a few debts in a later time and pay off just the outstanding debt. When the borrower refinances his/her loan, they can pay off the remainder of the debt. Example: If the borrower owes $1,500 in credit card payments and has a gross monthly income of $3,000, his DTI ratio would be 50%. But if the borrower owes $1,500 in payments and has a gross monthly income of $2,000, his DTI ratio would be 75%. Both a 50% and 75% DTI ratio would be too high for most lenders, as a DTI ratio of 43% is generally the cutoff for conventional mortgages. All other factors aside, the higher the DTI ratio, the less likely the borrower will be able to afford a monthly payment, hence the more risky it is for the lender.  Pricing, including risk-based pricing and relationship-based pricing  Pricing policy varies a great deal. While one probably can't influence the pricing policy of a given financial institution, one can: * Shop around * Ask for a better rate ‚Äì some financial institutions will respond to this, some won't * Price match ‚Äì many financial institutions will match a rate for a current customerWhat Affects My Loan Interest Rate (article) Pricing is often done in one of these ways. Follow the internal links for more details: * Everyone pays the same rate. This is an older approach, and most financial institutions no longer use this approach because it causes low risk customers to pay a higher than market rate, while high risk customers get a better rate than they might otherwise get, causing the financial institution to get a lower rate of return on the loan than the risk might imply. * Risk-based pricing. With this approach, pricing is based on various risk factors including loan to value, credit score, loan term (expected length, usually in months) * Relationship based pricing is often used to offer a slightly better rate to customers that have a substantial business relationship with the financial institution. This is often a price improvement offered on top of the otherwise computed rate.  Loan specific compliance requirements  Many of the customer identification and due diligence requirements of loan origination are common to new account opening of other financial products. The following sections describe the specific requirements of loans and mortgages.  Cross selling, add-on selling  * Add-on Credit insurance & debt cancellation * Credit cross selling * Up-selling * Down-selling * Refinancing * Loan recapture  Appraising collateral  The next step is to have a Real Estate appraiser appraise the borrower's property that he wishes to have the loan against. This is done to prevent fraud of any kind by either the borrower or the mortgage broker. This prevents fraud like \\"equity stripping\\" and money embezzlement. The amount that the appraiser from either the borrower's side or the lender's side is the amount that the borrower can loan up to. This amount is divided by the debt that the borrower wants to pay off plus other disbursements (i.e. cash-out, 1st mortgage, 2nd mortgage, etc.) and the appraised value (if a refinance) or purchase price (if a purchase) {which ever amount is lower} and converted into yet another ratio called the Loan to value (LTV) ratio. This ratio determines the type of loan and risk the lender is put up against. For example: if the borrower's house appraises for $415,000 and they wish to refinance for the amount of $373,500 ‚Äì the LTV ratio would be 90%. The lender also may put a limit to how much the LTV can be ‚Äì for example, if the borrower's credit is bad, the lender may limit the LTV that the borrower can loan. However, if the borrower's credit is in Good condition, then the lender will most likely not put a restriction on the borrower's LTV. LTV for loans may or may not exceed 100% depending on many factors. The appraisal would take place on location of the borrower's property. The appraiser may take pictures of the house from many angles and will take notes on how the property looks. He/she will type up an appraisal and submit it to the lender or broker (depending on who ordered the appraisal.) The Appraisal is written in the format compliant to FNMA Form 1004. The 1004 is the standard appraisal form used by appraisers nationwide.  Processing documents/loan underwriting  = Document preparation = Document Preparation or Doc Prep is the process of arranging and preparing the borrowers closing contracts. These documents vary from industry to industry but generally contain a note, disclosures, and other documents describing and detailing the agreement between the borrower and lender. =Mortgage underwriting= An underwriter is a person who evaluates the loan documentation and determines whether or not the loan complies with the guidelines of the particular mortgage program. It is the underwriter's responsibility to assess the risk of the loan and decide to approve or decline the loan. A processor is the one who gathers and submits the loan documents to the underwriter. Underwriters take at least 48 hours to underwrite the loan and after the borrower signs the package it takes 24 hours for a processor to process the documents.

The effect is that all of the light shining through is filtered, so that what would be white light becomes light of some color. Film toning is the process of replacing the silver particles in the emulsion with colored, silver salts, by means of chemicals. Unlike tinting, toning colored the darkest areas, leaving the white areas largely untouched. History =Tinting in the silent era= The process began in the 1890s, originally as a copy-guard against film pirates. The film was tinted amber, the color of the safelight on film printers. The discovery of bleaching methods by pirates soon put an end to this. Both the Edison Studios and the Biograph Company began tinting their films for setting moods. Because orthochromatic film stock could not be used in low-light situations, blue became the most popular tint, applied to scenes shot during the day and when projected, signified night. A variation of film tinting is hand coloring, in which only parts of the image are colored by hand with dyes, sometimes using a stencil cut from a second print of the film to keep colouring the same piece on different frames. The first hand tinted movie was Annabelle Serpentine Dance (1895), from Edison Studios. In it, Annabelle Moore, a young dancer from Broadway, is dressed in white veils that appear to change colors as she dances. Hand coloring was often used in early \\"trick\\" and fantasy films from Europe, especially those by Georges M√©li√®s. M√©li√®s experimented with color in his film biography of Joan of Arc (1900), leading to a more spectacular use of color in his 1903 Trip to the Moon, made available to modern viewers only after the 2012 release of a restoration of the film by Lobster Films. Some prints of the popular Edison film The Great Train Robbery (1903) had selected hand-colored scenes. Path√© had 100 young women at its factory at Vincennes who were employed as colorists. They produced the Life of Christ in 1910. As late as the 1920s, hand coloring processes were used for individual shots in Greed (1924) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925) (both utilizing the Handschiegl Color Process); and rarely, an entire feature-length movie such as The Last Days of Pompeii (1926) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1925), with color by Path√©'s stencil process Path√©chrome. By the early teens, with the onset of feature-length films, tinting was expanded upon as another mood setter, just as commonplace as music. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers estimated that by 1920, tinting was used for 80 to 90 percent of all films. The director D.W. Griffith displayed a constant interest and concern about color, and used tinting to a unique effect in many of his films. His 1915 epic, The Birth of a Nation, utilized a number of colors, including amber, blue, lavender, and a striking red tint for scenes such as the \\"burning of Atlanta\\" and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at the climax of the picture. Griffith later invented a color system in which colored lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a color effect. animated feature film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) In 1921, Kodak introduced pre-tinted stocks, with stained cellulose base, rather than a dyed emulsion upon the base. The colors available originally were lavender, red, green, blue, pink, light amber, dark amber, yellow, and orange. By the mid to late 1920s, tinting and toning were phased out for a number of reasons, the largest being that it was expensive and time-consuming. Since each color had to be dyed separately, then spliced into the show print, it also meant that each print was already weakened by having numerous splices in it, straight from the distributor. The introduction of panchromatic film stock, which registered all light rather than just blue light, also lessened the need for tinting. This meant that it was possible to shoot dark scenes and not have to tint them to relate to the audience that it was night. Eventually the rise of color film would make manual tinting obsolete. Another minor, but prevalent, factor was the coming of sound. Manually tinting a film ran the risk of interfering with the soundtrack on a sound-on-film system, making it unusable. In 1929, Kodak added to their tinted stocks a brand known as Sonochrome ‚Äî pre- tinted stocks for sound films that did not interfere with the soundtrack. But splicing together tinted sound prints interfered more with sound-on-disc processes such as Vitaphone, which needed to be frame accurate to keep in synchronization. Extra splices in a print were prone to human error and out of sync pictures. =Tinting in later years= Tinting was utilized for years up until the early 1950s in select sequences, full monochromatic pictures and short trailers and snipes. MGM invented an interference-free toning process, which was used in films such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Warner Brothers' The Sea Hawk (1940). Many MGM movies of the 1930s carried a sepia-like tone called \\"Pearl\\". The Technicolor Corporation continued to experiment with both tinting, toning and colorizing. The last reel of Portrait of Jennie (1948) contained both green and amber tints by Technicolor. Mighty Joe Young (1949) displayed a further concept of tinting by Technicolor, with various shades of red, orange, and yellow creating a fire-like effect for the last reel. The Cinecolor Corporation also created similar effects, and sepia-toned several films as well as tinted select scenes in chapters of the 1951 Columbia serial Captain Video. Common tints Over the years, general rules of thumb were developed for what color to use in certain scenes. Many of them were obvious, but a few artistic. Specific names were given to tints to specify certain colors. Striking effects could be achieved by both tinting and toning sequences. In order of most common: *Amber Tint (variations: straw amber, light amber, night amber) - used for daylight interiors. Night amber was sometimes used for exterior night scenes that were lit. Orange was common for night time interiors *Yellow Tint (aka: Sunshine) - Used for daylight exteriors exclusively. *Blue Tint (variations: Azure, Nocturne) - For night scenes that had no visible light source other than the moon. Blue tone (processed in Ferric ferrocyanide solution) was also somewhat common and usually an amber tint were used for scenes well lit by lamps, candles, etc. *Sepia tone - Processed through a silver sulfide ferrocyanide or uranium ferrocyanide solution. It was popular as an alternative to Sunshine or Amber. It was very popular in westerns and other pictures of the 1930s through the 1950s because of the dusty tone it gave and technically for its low interference rate on the soundtrack. *Red Tint (variations: Scarlet, Inferno, Firelight) - Used for scenes of fire, fury or explosion. Firelight was a light orange/yellow that was used with red tone to create realistic flames. Red tone was created by processing through a copper ferrocyanide solution. *Lavender Tint (variations: Purple Haze, Fleur de Lis) - Used in romantic, dusk or dawn, or oriental scenes primarily. Lavender tint was also used as a processing technique to cut down on contrast with duplicate negatives before fine grain positives were popular. *Rose (variations: Rose Dor√©, Peachblow, Candleflame) - Similar to lavender, sometimes used for low-key lit night interiors. *Green Tint (variations: Verdante, Aqua Green) - Scenes tinted in green were generally mysterious or seafaring scenes. Green tone, achieved by processing through vanadium ferrocyanide solution, was commonly used in jungle and nature scenes.Coe, Brian. The History of Movie Photography. Westfield, NJ: Eastview Editions, 1981. Print. Process The process for tinting was laborious, although simple in principle. Editing was done in rolls based on tint color, with numbered frames of film in between scenes for later assembly. Once these rolls were printed and processed from the negative, they were immersed in aniline dyes, specified to the colors that were listed in the script or continuity. Hardening fixer was not used on the film in order for the dye to be imbibed into the emulsion quicker and with better results. Once the film had dried on large film drums, it would be assembled in correct order and rewound onto reels for shipping. Toning was similar, but instead of aniline dyes, the film was immersed in chemicals to change the silver image into colored salts. In restoration Tinting and toning are important factors in film restoration today. They were an integral part of the moviegoing experience and the processes have been duplicated with modern methods for both video and film, based on the specifications of existing documentations on each film.

The mosque was built in the late 18th century by master-mi'mar Ustad Haj Sa'ban-ali. The mosque and theological school (madrasah) is located in the center of the city. Agha Bozorgh Mosque was constructed for prayers, preaching and teaching sessions held by Molla Mahdi Naraghi II also known as Mulla Mohammad Naraqi, known famously by his title of ƒÄghƒÅ Bozorgh (literally meaning big or great lord) given to him by the Shah himself. Molla Mahdi Naraghi II was the son of the legendary Mulla Ahmad Naraqi (also spelled sometimes as Naraghi) who was the second strongest person in Iran after the king himself, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi is well known for rallying the Iranian forces against the Russian invasion of northern Iran and declaring \\"jihad\\" or \\"holy war\\" against the invading Russians. He was successfully able to reconquer the Iranian lands that the invading Russian forces had captured during that offensive. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi, his brothers, his sons, and his father Mulla Muhammad Mahdi Naraqi famously known as Muhaqqiq Naraqi; are some of the most prominent Shi'a clerics as well as some of the most famous Islamic Iranian scientists of their time. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi and his father Muhaqqiq Naraqi are especially well known and honored to this day in Iran as the leading Islamic leaders of their time. It being the first time in Shi'a Twelver Islam that the helm of leadership of the faith was passed from father to son. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi was so accomplished in jurisprudence at the time of his father's passing (1209 AH/1795 CE) that it was agreed upon in a general consensus by the other leading figures of the time, to have Mulla Ahmad Naraqi as the next leader of the faith. Muhaqqiq Naraqi and Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's status in society at the time as leaders in both politics, jurisprudence, and faith can best be compared to the power and position held by Popes in the Catholic Church. They were in essence the leaders of the entire Twelver Shi'a world. With Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's passing in 1229 AH/1829 CE he was honored by being interred in the Shrine of Ali. His legacy holds as one of the most important and renowned Muslims in the past 1100 years and one of only a handful of Muslims who have been honored throughout history by being laid to rest in the Shrine of Imam Ali. Specifications The mosque has been described as \\"the finest Islamic complex in Kashan and one of the best of the mid-19th century\\". Noted for its symmetrical design, it consists of two large iwans, one in front of the mihrab and the other by the entrance. The courtyard has a second court in the middle which comprises a garden with trees and a fountain. The iwan in front of mehrab has two minarets with a brick dome. It was here where Ustad Ali Maryam as a pupil started his career as an architect.

The plot concerns a prospective model who joins a coven of white wizards. Plot Sisters Christine and Betty (Ann and Vicki Michelle) run away from home to find work as models. They are given a lift to London by Johnny (Keith Buckley), a businessman who is instantly attracted to Betty. Christine successfully auditions for unscrupulous modelling agent Sybil Waite (Patricia Haines) and is offered a weekend's work shooting an advert at a house in the country. Betty goes with her. The modelling job is actually a ploy to initiate Christine into a coven of white wizards led by Sybil and the owner of the house, Gerald Amberley (Neil Hallett). Christine, who is shown to have psychic ability, willingly undergoes the initiation ritual, during which her virginity is taken by Amberley. Christine's powers create tension between her and Sybil, who practises darker magic and has a predatory sexual interest in her. The conflict escalates when Sybil vows to have Betty initiated into the coven. Johnny, who has been warned about Sybil's true nature, arrives to take Betty away. However, Christine places him under her control, forcing him to participate in Betty's initiation. During the ritual, Christine wrests control from Sybil by psychically torturing her. Johnny, no longer under Christine's control, takes Betty's virginity. Christine then uses her powers to kill Sybil and take her place as high priestess of the coven. Cast *Ann Michelle as Christine *Vicki Michelle as Betty *Patricia Haines as Sybil Waite *Neil Hallett as Gerald Amberley *Keith Buckley as Johnny *James Chase as Peter *Helen Downing as Abby Darke Production The producer was \\"Ralph Solomons\\" (a pseudonym of Kent Walton), whose other producing credits include The Green Shoes, It's the Only Way to Go, and A Persian Fairy Tale. Although Hazel Adair's name appears in the credits (as co-writer of the song \\"You Go Your Way\\"), she did not admit to co-producing the film until 1975, when she featured in an episode of the BBC's Man Alive on the subject of sex films. The revelation that prompted Cinema X magazine (volume 4, issue 4) to remark that her films \\"are far removed from Miss Adair's more cozy world of Crossroads\\", Adair's other films include Clinic Exclusive (1971), Can You Keep It Up for a Week? (1974), Keep It Up Downstairs (1976) and the more mainstream Game for Vultures (1979). \\"Klaus Vogel\\", who wrote the script and the film's tie-in novelisation, was in fact Crossroads producer Beryl Vertue. Virgin Witch was filmed in Surrey during 1970 and previewed in the December editions of Mayfair and Continental Film Review (in which the title was stated to be \\"The Virgin Witch\\"). However, the film is copyrighted as a 1971 production, and censorship problems would mean it was not widely seen until 1972. The country house location, Admiral's Walk in Pirbright, Surrey,Photograph: \\"Pirbright, Admirals Walk c1965\\" would be later used by Norman J. Warren for his films Satan's Slave (1976) and Terror (1978). Censorship history Virgin Witch was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1971, but was passed with an X rating by the Greater London Council for a limited release in the capital.

It was created by Macintosh and Newton pioneer Steve Capps and musician Ed Bogas. The program was published by Impulse, Inc.. Overview The software differed from other audio creation packages as it used 8-bit audio samples of real instruments rather than sounds generated by the Macintosh sound chip, as did packages such as MusicWorks and Deluxe Music Construction Set (DMCS). It was capable of playing back 6 tracks simultaneously in the original version, updated later to 8. There were two modes or screens, the authoring screen and the playback-only screen. In the authoring screen, the user entered notes on a staff with treble and bass clef using the mouse, and selecting the duration of the note with on-screen buttons or keyboard shortcuts. In the playback screen, an animated simulation of a VU- meter was displayed for each track. The package shipped with a selection of several sampled instruments and several add-on packages were later released, such as the Heavy Metal Instrument pack that included more drum and guitar samples. Other packs were Country and Brass. The music samples provided were created by Gary Clayton working with Ed Bogas' band. The user was not provided with any software for creating their own instruments for use in Studio Session, however it was possible to record new instruments or convert existing samples using commercially available audio-editing software such as SoundWave from Impulse Inc with the MacNifty Audio Digitzer. Reception Compute! called Jam Session \\"a strange, entrancing thrill\\", stating that it was harder to use than Instant Music but provided more control. It won the 1987 Software Publishers Association awards for Best Graphics and Best Entertainment Program. New version In 1989 Broderbund released a new Jam Session version for the Macintosh II and SE. Additionally a version of the Apple IIGS computer was released, differing in its utilization of full color graphics for animated performance scenes and 15 voice stereo music. Musical themes featured in this port were: Pop Rock, Heavy Metal, Country, Classical Concert Hip-Hop, Rap and Jazz. Users loaded a song from a specific theme and simply \\"jammed\\" along using the keyboard to play accompanying instruments, which had the option of being auto-harmonized and auto-timed to match with the musical score playing.

Predominantly, all Sluddens in the Scottish line come from Cormick. James Sludden (born ??) from Tyrone married Teresa Hunter. They had four known children: John J(ames), Charles, Elizabeth and Annie. It is believed that all remained in Ireland with the exception of John J. who married Elizabeth Ann McMullen and moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, crossing from Liverpool on board the Celtic in 1921. Along with an Ann Sludden who emigrated to Massachusetts with her three-month-old child (sex unknown), the five children of John J.

Although static data structures may provide very good functionality and fast queries, their utility is limited because of their inability to grow/shrink quickly, thus making them inapplicable for the solution of dynamic problems, where the amount of the input data changes. Dynamization techniques provide uniform ways of creating dynamic data structures. Decomposable search problems We define problem P of searching for the predicate M match in the set S as P(M,S). Problem P is decomposable if the set S can be decomposed into subsets S_i and there exists an operation + of result unification such that P(M,S) = P(M,S_0) + P(M,S_1) + \\\\dots + P(M,S_n). Decomposition Decomposition is a term used in computer science to break static data structures into smaller units of unequal size. The basic principle is the idea that any decimal number can be translated into a representation in any other base. For more details about the topic see Decomposition (computer science). For simplicity, binary system will be used in this article but any other base (as well as other possibilities such as Fibonacci numbers) can also be utilized. If using the binary system, a set of n elements is broken down into subsets of sizes with :2^{i}*n_{i} elements where n_{i} is the i-th bit of n in binary. This means that if n has i-th bit equal to 0, the corresponding set does not contain any elements. Each of the subset has the same property as the original static data structure. Operations performed on the new dynamic data structure may involve traversing \\\\log_{2}\\\\left(n\\\\right) sets formed by decomposition. As a result, this will add O(\\\\log\\\\left(n\\\\right)) factor as opposed to the static data structure operations but will allow insert/delete operation to be added. Kurt Mehlhorn proved several equations for time complexity of operations on the data structures dynamized according to this idea. Some of these equalities are listed. If P_S\\\\left(n\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = time to build the static data structure Q_S\\\\left(n\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = time to query the static data structure Q_D\\\\left(n\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = time to query the dynamic data structure formed by decomposition \\\\overline{I} = amortized insertion time then Q_D\\\\left(n\\\\right) = O(Q_S\\\\left(n\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\left(n\\\\right))\\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\overline{I}=O(\\\\left(P_S\\\\left(n\\\\right)/n\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\left(n\\\\right)) If Q_S\\\\left(n\\\\right) is at least polynomial, then Q_D\\\\left(n\\\\right)=O\\\\left(Q_S\\\\left(n\\\\right)\\\\right).

Biography  = Origins = Though the precise identity of the man known as Alexis le Trotteur is the subject of some debate, most historians agree he was in fact Alexis Lapointe, born in 1860 at either Saint-√âtienne-de-la-Malbaie or Clermont, in the Charlevoix region, to a family of 14 children. He established himself very early as an eccentric who was persuaded that he was in fact a stallion born in human form. As a child, he built wooden horses to play with. As a teenager, he would whip himself to stimulate his muscles and would undertake long trips throughout his native region, like his favourite animal. His family had trouble accepting his eccentricity; Alexis would leave home at the age of 18 and spend the rest of his life on the road.  Legendary exploits  Image of the monument inaugurated on August 18, 2010 in honor of Alexis Lapointe (1860-1924) at Des Berges Municipal Park in Clermont, QC. He was renowned for being one of the greatest runners of his time. His physical exploits have been so embellished over time that it has become difficult to separate the fact from the fiction. He is said to have raced against several horses, against whom he supposedly always won, including the prize stallion of Seigneur Duggan de La Malbaie. It earned him several nicknames, such as le Centaure (the Centaur), le Surcheval (the Superhorse) and le Cheval du Nord (the Horse of the North). Author Marius Barbeau describes him as a simpleton, having just enough wit to profit from his strangeness ; he became famous in his own way. Probably the most famous anecdote concerning him tells that one day, he was on the quay of La Malbaie with his father who had to leave by boat to Bagotville at 11 o'clock. According to the legend, his father refused to take him along, so he told him, \\"When you arrive at Bagotville, I will be there to grab the moorings.\\" Alexis then took a whip to stimulate himself and undertook to run the entire way to Bagotville, that is 146 kilometres. Twelve hours later, when the boat docked at Bagotville at 11 o'clock at night, Alexis was on the wharf waiting for his father. He would participate in fairs and competitions where he would show off his physical abilities to make a profit. It was said he could dance all evening and all night without tiring. Races were organized in which Alexis raced against trains and the very first cars to appear in the region (he beat them all, of course.) F√©lix-Antoine Savard, an author of the time, also described him as an able woodstove builder. = Death = Alexis le Trotteur was killed by a train while working on the construction site of the Isle- Maligne hydroelectric plant. Opinions vary as to the exact cause of his death. Some believe he tripped while trying to outrace the train; others say that, due to his physical decline, he decided to commit suicide. One of his co- workers on the site, cited by the historian Serge Gauthier, hinted as much: \\"I saw him ten years later in Matap√©dia, where he was only a construction worker like you or I. He was still well spoken of, but like a faded star. They said he could no longer run any faster than a regular horse.\\" Another man named Jeen Sherman witnessed Alexis racing against a car.  Legacy  = Remains = In 1966 his remains were exhumed from the La Malbaie cemetery by a specialist in physical activity, Jean-Claude Larouche, in order to examine them; he confirmed that a sustained lifelong training had made him into a formidable athlete. His bones were then entrusted to the Mus√©e du Saguenay- Lac-Saint-Jean in Chicoutimi. An exhibition opened in 1999 called \\"Alexis le Trotteur: Athlete or Centaur?\\", in which his bones and objects having belonged to him were exhibited. = Popular culture = The story of Alexis le Trotteur has seen numerous adaptations into stories and novels. The historian Serge Gauthier counted books, movies, names of streets, music records and songs, a ballet, a comic book, a sports festival, etc., all bearing his name. Between 1979 and 1981 he was depicted in a four-volume comic book series published by √âditions Paulines, with writing by Blaise and artwork by Bos : L'Homme qui courait comme un cheval : Alexis le trotteur (1979), Au trot et au galop : Alexis le trotteur (1979), Alexis le trotteur contre Baba (1981), and Alexis le trotteur: le Pony express (1981). The Quebec folk music group Mes A√Øeux wrote a song about him, entitled Train de vie (le Surcheval), which was released on their album En famille, drawing parallels between the life of Alexis le Trotteur and the frenetic pace of modern living. Written in first person narrative, Alexis Lapointe is one of several anecdotal portraits of artists and athletes appearing on Seamus Cater & Viljam Nybacka's 2012 album The Anecdotes.

Paint Valley High School is the result of centralizing the high schools in both Bainbridge (Paxton and Paint Townships) and Bourneville (Twin Township.) The Bearcat mascot comes from a fusion of the Bainbridge Polar Bears and the Twin Tigers. The original Paint Valley High School was built in 1959. Junior high and vocational agriculture wings were added in 1975. In 1987-88 an arts wing was added. In 2003 Paint Valley combined both Bainbridge and Twin Elementary schools (the former high schools) into a brand new elementary/middle school building located beside the high school. The elementary school formerly known as Twin Elementary was auctioned off and demolished in 2008. Bainbridge elementary had a boiler explosion and was partially demolished in 2006.

A new team with the same name played two replacement games for the Ultimate Indoor Football League in 2012. History Formed in time for the 2006 season, the West Palm Beach Phantoms were scheduled to play their home games at the Delray Beach Tennis Center in Delray Beach, Florida, which would have made them the first indoor football team to play in an outdoor venue. After losing their first two road contests, however, the Phantoms' first home game, scheduled for April 8, 2006, was called off due to a contract dispute. While the team's ownership tried to work out a deal with the tennis center, the Phantoms were sent wandering around the league as a road-only team. The Phantoms managed one win in their history: a 43-41 win over the Osceola Outlaws on May 13, 2006. But with no home field, the team finally had to cancel all of its home games, and much of the team quit. With hardly any quality players left on its roster, Palm Beach lost their final two games by embarrassing margins; first, 70-0 to the eventual league runner-up Fayetteville Guard, followed by an incredible 132-3 dismantling by the Katy Copperheads, marking the worst defeat in indoor/arena football history. Owner Michael Lind had seen enough, and the appropriately named Phantoms vanished, their final record 1-6. A new indoor football team, the Palm Beach Waves, lasted just three games into the 2007 season before bailing out of the NIFL. =2012 revival= In 2012, the Palm Beach Phantoms name was revived for a proposed franchise in the United Indoor Football League. The reborn Phantoms played two replacement games against UIFL opponents: the Florida Tarpons, in front of 4,993 fans at Germain Arena, and the Lakeland Raiders, in Lakeland. Unfortunately, the new Phantoms were no more successful than the old ones, losing 91-18 to Florida and 100-0 to Lakeland. =Outdoor and attempted relaunches= Since then, the Palm Beach Phantoms have played independently as a semi-professional team, often playing outdoors. Occasionally, they have been added as members of various startup leagues such as World Developmental Football League for 2015, Elite Indoor Football (a league set up by the Savannah Steam) for 2017, the Elite Indoor Football Conference (a separate league started by the Central Florida Jaguars) for 2017, and Arena Pro Football (a league briefly associated with the EIFC) for 2017. Along with their attempts at joining various leagues in 2017, they were scheduled to play a home-and-home preseason series with the Savannah Coastal Outlaws of Arena Pro Football. The Phantoms were listing their home field as the Lakeland Center in the Lakeland, Florida (the home arena of the Central Florida Jaguars). However, the dates passed and no games were played with the Outlaws merely stating that they had been cancelled.

She first appeared in issue #1 of the second series of the Teen Titans comics. She remained a regular member of that team for a long time, until the events of Graduation Day when the Titans were disbanded by Nightwing. Fictional character biography =Teen Titans= Toni Monetti is the daughter of a former U.S. Senator from New Jersey. Around the time she turns sixteen, Toni's skin gains a silver sheen. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni is mysteriously teleported away. She and a few other teens learn that they are half alien, their mothers having been impregnated by an alien race called the H'San Natall. The teens are part of a sleeper agent program created by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The teens stay together, and with the funding of Loren Jupiter, become the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans. Toni‚Äôs ability to control bursts of silver plasma energy earns her the codename Argent.Teen Titans #3 This group is seen in the crossover entitled \\"JLA: World Without Grownups\\". Argent and her allies are seen rescuing misguided children from the dangers of an amusement park that has no adult supervision.JLA World Without Grownups At first, Toni is not a very serious adventurer. However, when teammate Joto apparently dies, Argent takes it particularly hard. She vows to become a better hero. When Mr. Jupiter disbands the team, Argent seeks training advice from Robin. She accompanies him on a mission to stop drug runners, but when she finds out her father is involved, she decides to keep the information secret.Teen Titans #6 When the Teen Titans reform, Argent is instrumental in initiating a membership drive. The team takes on new members Fringe and Captain Marvel Jr. (also known as CM3). A possible romance between Argent and CM3 is explored but is abandoned after a particularly horrible date (CM3 is unable to cover the bill).Teen Titans #10 After another battle with the H'San Natall, the team discovers that Joto is, in fact, alive. When members Prysm and Fringe decide to stay in space, and with CM3 having left earlier, the team decides to disband. =The Titans= When the original five Titans, (Nightwing, Troia, Flash, Tempest, and Arsenal), decide to reform as the Teen Titans in the wake of the Technis Imperative conflict (in which Toni had fought alongside the former Titans and the JLA), Argent is invited to join.Titans #4 Later, the Titans participate in another case involving the highly addictive speed drug, Velocity 9. During the investigation, the role of Argent's father as a distributor of the drug comes to light. Argent has to choose between her father and the Titans, and ultimately allows her father to be arrested.Titans #10 Around this time, Argent is one of the first to fight against the Asmodel/Spectre entity in the \\"Day of Judgment\\" limited series. First, alongside Titans teammate Damage, then with other superheroes, she helps fight a literal invasion from Hell in the streets of New York City. For her troubles, Spectre turns her eyes into squirming fly larvae. She and other heroes affected are restored by the efforts of the \\"Sentinels of Magic\\". In the Graduation Day story arc, a mysterious android from the future known as Indigo attacks the Titans and Young Justice, resulting in the apparent deaths of Troia and Omen. After the funeral, Nightwing disbands the Titans. When the Teen Titans are once again reformed by former members Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy, Argent is not invited. However, when this version of the Teen Titans fights against Dr. Light and all reserve members are called, she is present. She also joins the Titans in their battle against Superboy-Prime and saves Risk by stopping the blood flowing from his shoulder after Superboy-Prime rips his arm off. =One Year Later= One Year Later, Argent becomes one of the twenty members of the Teen Titans who quit after a few weeks.

While she initially could not fly, she could create slides and flying platforms to carry herself and others through the air. Her silver plasma energy is said to be of a similar wavelength to the green plasma energies of a Green Lantern's ring. In JLA: Rock of Ages, Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able to fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma creatures and make them act on their own accord but remain under her control. In other media =Television= * Argent appeared in the Teen Titans episode \\"Calling All Titans\\" voiced by Hynden Walch. She meets Starfire and becomes an honorary Titan, but she is soon captured by General Immortus of the Brotherhood of Evil. Argent can fire crimson energy beams, and can use that energy to form objects similar to the abilities of the Green Lantern. The Argent in this series appears to be a New Zealander rather than an American. Argent has also been shown to have an interest in fashion when she asks Starfire: \\"Does this come in black?\\" when the yellow communicator clashes with her dark clothes. When M√°s y Menos unfreeze all of the captured Titans during the final battle of \\"Titans Together\\", Argent joins the fight.

The body size is up to 18 mm, with a leg-span of 28 mm. Common species are Lampona cylindrata and Lampona murina. Both these species have been introduced to New Zealand. White-tailed spiders are vagrant hunters that seek out and envenom prey rather than spinning a web to capture it; their preferred prey is other spiders. They are reported to bite humans, with effects including a red mark, and local itchiness, swelling and pain. On rare occasions, bites can result in nausea, vomiting, malaise or headache. Although ulcers and necrosis have been attributed to the bites, a scientific study by Isbister and Gray (2003) showed they had other causes, mostly infections. A study of 130 white-tailed spider bites found no necrotic ulcers or confirmed infections. Taxonomy Ludwig Carl Christian Koch described Lampona cylindrata in 1866 and Lampona murina in 1873. The genus name comes from the Latin lampo (\\"to shine\\"). The species name cylindrata refers to the cylindric body shape, while murinus means \\"mouse-gray\\" in Latin. Description L. cylindrata male specimen on display in the Australian Museum L. cylindrata female specimen on display in the Australian Museum L. cylindrata ‚Äì face detail with fangs The two common species of white-tailed spiders are Lampona cylindrata and Lampona murina. They are similar in appearance; L. cylindrata is slightly larger with females being up to 18 mm long while males are up to 12 mm in body length. The legs span approximately 28 mm. The two species are not easily distinguished without microscopic examination. They are slender spiders with dark reddish to grey, cigar-shaped body and dark orange-brown banded legs. The grey abdomen has two pairs of faint white spots and‚Äîusually but not always‚Äîa distinct white spot at the tip just above the spinnerets. The similarities have led people to think there is only one species of white-tailed spider. It is possible that not all white- tailed species have been identified. The descriptor, white tail, is applied to a variety of species of spiders for which a distal white mark on their abdomen is a distinctive feature; other markings disappear with moultings but the white tail remains to adulthood. L. cylindrata lay pinkish eggs which are enclosed in a flattened silk capsule and are guarded by the female until they hatch. Distribution Both species are native to Australia. Lampona cylindrata is present across south-east Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia while Lampona murina is found in eastern Australia from north-east Queensland to Victoria. The spiders have been introduced in New Zealand with Lampona murina residing in the North Island for over a hundred years while Lampona cylindrata has become widespread throughout the South Island since 1980. Habitat and behaviour They live in gardens and inside houses, beneath bark and rocks, in leaf litter and are often found in the folds of clothes, towels and shoes. They do not build webs. Most active at night, they hunt for other spiders. Their favoured prey are the black house spider (Badumna insignis) and the closely related brown house spider (Badumna longinqua), both of which, like the whitetail, are native to Australia but have been inadvertently introduced to New Zealand. Bites to humans A common perception is that white tail spider bites can be associated with long term skin infections, and in rarer cases progression to necrosis. This is an attribution of infections presenting to medical care with a complaint of \\"spider bite.\\" Venom has no bacteria, and infections do not arise from spider bites. The well-described brown recluse bite causes direct damage to skin and tissue. It has a limited area and does not spread. No formal studies have found evidence for associating necrosis with white tail spider bites. White tail spider bites may cause a small red or discolored bump, similar to an insect bite, that burns or itches. The issue of necrosis in some bite cases in published studies begins with a paper presented at the International Society on Toxinology World Congress held in Brisbane in 1982. Both the white-tailed spider and the wolf spider were considered as candidates for possibly causing suspected spider bite necrosis in the Australian context. In Brazil the recluse spider was identified as linked to necrosis. Following this initial report, numerous other cases implicated white-tailed spiders in causing necrotic ulcers. All of these cases lacked a positively identified spider ‚Äî or even a spider bite in some cases. Additionally, there had not been a case of arachnogenic necrosis reported in the two hundred years of European colonisation before these cases. Of the 130 cases of white tail spider bites studied by Isbister and Gray, more than 60% reported that the person had been bitten by spiders that had got into clothing, towels or beds. Clinical toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister studied 130 cases of arachnologist-identified white-tailed spider bites, and found no necrosis or confirmed infections, concluding that such outcomes are very unlikely for a white-tailed spider bite. The major effects from a bite in this study were local (pain, a red mark, local swelling and itchiness); and rarely systemic (nausea, vomiting, malaise or headache). All these symptoms are generally mild and resolve over time.

Historically it has been used to establish language genealogies. Second language acquisition Contrastive analysis was used extensively in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) in the 1960s and early 1970s, as a method of explaining why some features of a target language were more difficult to acquire than others. According to the behaviourist theories prevailing at the time, language learning was a question of habit formation, and this could be reinforced or impeded by existing habits. Therefore, the difficulty in mastering certain structures in a second language (L2) depended on the difference between the learners' mother language (L1) and the language they were trying to learn. =History= The theoretical foundations for what became known as the contrastive analysis hypothesis were formulated in Robert Lado's Linguistics Across Cultures (1957). In this book, Lado claimed that \\"those elements which are similar to [the learner's] native language will be simple for him, and those elements that are different will be difficult\\". While it was not a novel suggestion, Lado was the first to provide a comprehensive theoretical treatment and to suggest a systematic set of technical procedures for the contrastive study of languages. That involved describing the languages (using structuralist linguistics), comparing them and predicting learning difficulties. During the 1960s, there was a widespread enthusiasm with this technique, manifested in the contrastive descriptions of several European languages, many of which were sponsored by the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, DC. It was expected that once the areas of potential difficulty had been mapped out through contrastive analysis, it would be possible to design language courses more efficiently. Contrastive analysis, along with behaviourism and structuralism exerted a profound effect on SLA curriculum design and language teacher education, and provided the theoretical pillars of the audio-lingual method. =Criticism and its response= In its strongest formulation, the contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that all the errors made in learning the L2 could be attributed to 'interference' by the L1. However, this claim could not be sustained by empirical evidence that was accumulated in the mid- and late 1970s. It was soon pointed out that many errors predicted by Contrastive Analysis were inexplicably not observed in learners' language. Even more confusingly, some uniform errors were made by learners irrespective of their L1. It thus became clear that contrastive analysis could not predict all learning difficulties, but was certainly useful in the retrospective explanation of errors. In response to the above criticisms, a moderate version of the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) has developed which paradoxically contradicts Lado's original claim. The new CAH hypothesizes that the more different the L2 is with one's L1, the easier it is for one to learn the target language. The prediction is based on the premise that similarities in languages create confusion for learners. With the help of technological advancement, contrastive analysis has adopted a more efficient method in obtaining language data, a corpus-based approach, which generates vast amount of juxtapositions of language differences in various fields of linguistics, for example lexis and syntax. Applications There are multiple fields in the realms of linguistics to which Contrastive Analysis (CA) is applicable: * Historical linguistics, a former application of CA, which is subsumed under the name comparative linguistics, a branch in linguistics not to be confused with CA. * Second language teaching: Despite CA's limitation in the prediction of L2 learners' errors, it provides insights to at least some of the major mistakes that are frequently made by L2 learners irrespective of their L1. Hence, more tailor-made language design can be adopted; examples include awareness raising teaching method and hierarchical learning teaching curriculum. * Second language learning: Awareness raising is the major contribution of CA in second language learning. This includes CA's abilities to explain observed errors and to outline the differences between two languages; upon language learners' realization of these aspects, they can work to adopt a viable way to learn instead of rote learning, and correct fossilized language errors. * Sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, bilingualism, pragmatics and others cultural-related areas: CA is, in itself, a cross-linguistic/cross-cultural study, and its ability to apply both linguistic and non-linguistic features is one of its major merits. This permits a better linguistic-cultural understanding, which is essential for learning a language in its entirety. * Translation: CA provides better understanding of linguistic difference between two languages and therefore may be applied to the field of translation. Primarily, CA certainly lays a foundation for translation as it is integral that translators and interpreters have a thorough understanding of not only the languages they work between, but of the differences between them as well. Also, it might balance the word-for-word vs. sense-for sense debate by developing strategies to overcome the linguistic hindrance. Moreover, it may avoid awkward translations such as translationese and Europeanization. * Language therapy: Distinguishing the difference between language disorder patients from non-standard dialect speakers. This is essential in identifying speech pathology and their corresponding treatment. * Criminal investigation: CA research offers insight to subtle differences among languages. Language patterns can be used as clues to investigate criminal activities, for example analyzing phishing texts designed to deceive users into giving away confidential information.

It had its origins in the Royal Military College, High Wycombe founded in 1799, which in 1802 became the Senior Department of the new Royal Military College. In 1858 the name of the Senior Department was changed to \\"Staff College\\", and in 1870 this was separated from the Royal Military College. Apart from periods of closure during major wars, the Staff College continued to operate until 1997, when it was merged into the new Joint Services Command and Staff College. The equivalent in the Royal Navy was the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich and the equivalent in the Royal Air Force was the RAF Staff College, Bracknell. Origins Old print of the College In 1799, Colonel John Le Marchant submitted a proposal to the Duke of York, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, for a Royal Military College. A private officer training school, based on the idea of a senior or staff department in the proposed college, was opened in the same year by Colonel Le Marchant, at the Antelope Inn, High Wycombe, and designated the Royal Military College, High Wycombe, with himself as commandant. This facility was officially recognised by royal warrant in 1801 as the senior department of the Royal Military College which was to open at a large house in 1802 in Great Marlow.Marlow Tour Marlow Society Le Marchant was now appointed as Lieutenant-Governor and Superintendent-General of the College.Major-General John Gaspard Le Marchant (1766‚Äì1812) Defence Academy The course lasted for two years and in 1808 was specifically stated as intended to train future commanding officers and staff officers. Until 1858, students were required to pay to attend. The senior department of the Royal Military College moved to a building in West Street in Farnham, Surrey in 1813 and in 1820 joined the junior department (which trained aspiring officers before they were commissioned) at Sandhurst. Decline, independence and growth The college underwent a decline and by 1857 the annual admissions had fallen to just six. In 1858 the name was changed to \\"the Staff College\\" and it was made independent of the Royal Military College in 1870. It now had its own commandant and adjutant, although continued to be administered by Sandhurst until 1911. Proper entry and final examinations had been introduced for the primarily military subjects taught. Purpose-built premises were approved in 1858 and built between 1859 and 1863 to a design by James Pennethorne, adjacent to the Royal Military College (but over the county boundary in Camberley). During the 1870s there were just forty students although numbers increased to sixty students in the 1880s. In 1903 officers of the colonial forces were allowed to join the college, and in 1905 naval officers were introduced. With the threat of a second war with Germany, the college was expanded and restructured in 1938, with a junior wing at Camberley for officers of an average age of 29 years, and a senior wing at Minley Manor, Farnborough for graduates of the school returned for further training, and aged about 35 years.Vote a.

The town administers two villages, Liviu Rebreanu (formerly Prislop; Priszlop) and Lu»ôca (Szamospart). At the 2011 census, 93.6% of inhabitants were Romanians, 5.5% Roma and 0.6% Hungarians. History The name NƒÉsƒÉud is possibly derived from the Slavic nas voda, meaning \\"near the water\\". Another etymology is from Nu√üdorf (Nussdorf, \\"walnut tree village\\"), the Transylvanian Saxon name of the town during the Middle Ages. However, it derived from a person name, documented in 1269 as Naswod (current Nesvady). A former Habsburg border town known for its border regiments with panache and good schools, NƒÉsƒÉud saw industrial expansion during the communist era and industrial collapse after 1989. Local economic activity revolves around the remittance economy generated by massive outmigration to Spain and Italy during the early 2000s, although the largest industrial employers in textiles and chemicals have been rejuvenated by EU membership. NƒÉsƒÉud still has a few late 18th and early 19th century buildings left standing. Most remarkable in this regard is the local Romanian Greek Catholic church and the former military headquarters of the Habsburg era military regiment, now a museum. Although the town hall is located in its midst, the 19th century center of the town has been left to decay. Since 2012 the municipality has begun to restore the buildings in the old city center. The town hall saw a complete restoration and expansion in 2013. The economic upturn of the mid-2000s has translated into a better city life and infrastructure improvements. Most notable in this regard are the refurbishing of the old military headquarters (now a museum), improved roads and more bar/restaurant options. Two new restaurants (Geea and La Borsanu) are popular in town.

It is situated on the eastern shore of Lough Derg across from its 'twin-town' of Killaloe on the west bank of the lake. The towns are joined by Killaloe Bridge. The annual Brian Boru Festival takes place in early July each year. A joint celebration between the two towns of the ancient High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, it involves many community-based activities including a hurling match between the teams from both towns. Ballina has a primary school, Ballina National School, with the nearest secondary school, St. Anne's Community College, present in Killaloe. History Ballina was an important stopping point for barges traveling up the Shannon along with Killaloe. Back in the 19th and early 20th century dockers and bargemen would pass through Ballina to go to Dublin to deliver their goods. However this began to decline when train lines were set up to link it to other major lines, making the transport of goods cheaper. As a result the barges eventually disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s. They came back for a brief period during the Emergency but vanished some time after that. The railway tracks were removed in the 1950s, having fallen into disrepair. New lines which linked Limerick directly to Dublin meant there was no need for them, and they were taken up. During the War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921), three young men were shot on the bridge as suspected IRA men by the Black and Tans and auxiliaries. There is now a headstone where the men were shot in honour of their memory. Transport For a long period, there was no traffic control system present on the bridge. While it was possible for cars to pass each other, it was difficult for HGVs and cars, and impossible for two HGVs, to pass. This led to the introduction of a traffic light system which, while leading to delays at peak times, has improved safety and traffic flow on the bridge. There are plans to build a new bridge downstream, as the existing bridge is preserved and cannot be widened. In December 2006 North Tipperary County Council sought tenders for a 'design and build' contract for the new Shannon crossing. Sport Ballina has a G.A.A. club which is made up of Ballina and Boher. In 1885 Ballina GAA club was formally established. At a convention in Nenagh on Sunday 20 November 1887, 35 affiliated clubs were represented by their respective delegates. This list of 35 included two from the parish, namely Ballina and Boher. In 1902 Michael Minihan of Boher became North Tipperary Chairman. In 1883 a Ballina / Boher combination under the name of Kincora, beat Killaloe. Which is one of the first inter-county games on record, with Kincora recording a victory of 2-1 to 0-1.

Great Western's headquarters were in Chatsworth, California. At one time, Great Western was one of the largest savings and loan in the nation, second only to Home Savings of America. The bank was acquired by Washington Mutual in 1997 for $6.8 billion. Great Western Bank was held by Great Western Financial Corporation (\\"GWFC\\"), a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. History Great Western was founded in 1919 in California as a savings and loan association. In 1955, it was merged into a holding company, Great Western Financial Corp. Within five years, Great Western acquired Santa Ana Savings (1956), West Coast Savings (Sacramento, 1957), Guaranty Savings (San Jose, 1958), Central Savings (San Luis Obispo, 1959), and First Savings (Oakland, 1959). The company later bought Santa Rosa Savings (1968) and Safety Savings (Los Angeles, 1969). In 1970 and 1971, Great Western purchased four additional California savings and loan establishments. In 1972, Great Western Financial combined them all into Great Western Savings. =1980s-1990s= In the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, Great Western acquired many failed savings and loan offices from the Resolution Trust Corporation. In December 1985, Great Western moved some administrative functions into a building that it partially owns in Chatsworth. In October 1989, Great Western announced that they plan to move their headquarters to a yet to be built 10-story executive office building on a 20-acre site in Chatsworth that is adjacent to an existing nine-building service center with plans of selling their current Beverly Hills headquarters building. Great Western finally moved out of their Beverly Hills headquarters to their new headquarters in Chatsworth in May 1992. In September 1993, Great Western announced that they were selling its Visa credit card operations to Associates Corporation of North America, part of the Ford Financial Services Group, which issues credit cards through Associates National Bank in Delaware. On January 17, 1994, Great Western's administrative campus in Chatsworth, California was particularly affected by the Northridge earthquake. Despite the quake, that year's profits quadrupled, thanks to the need for lower loss reserves and the gain on the sale of its 31 branches on Florida's Gulf Coast. In 1995, Great Western's chairman James Montgomery passed the office of CEO to president John Maher, who accelerated the drive toward banking services. In 1996, the company announced a $115 million restructuring program that would eliminate 800 jobs, consolidate mortgage banking branches, and install new technology. Later that year, Great Western sold its student loan business to Crestar Bank. =Expansion in California= In January 1982, Great Western announced the pending acquisition of Palo Alto-based Northern California Savings & Loan Association with its 61 offices for $61 million in stock.

In July 1989, Great Western announced the pending acquisition of 63 out of 71 offices of the Miami-based CenTrust Bank for $150 million in cash. The pending acquisition represented $2.4 billion in CenTrust deposits. But the ailing bank was seized by Office of Thrift Supervision in February 1990 for \\"unsafe and unsound financial condition\\", before regulator approval could be obtained that would allow the sale to proceed. After negotiating with the Resolution Trust Corporation, Great Western paid the RTC $86 million in June 1990 for all 71 branch offices and $2.1 billion of failed CenTrust's $5.2 billion in deposits. Centrust's failure was the largest savings and loan failure at that time and it had cost the taxpayers $1.7 billion to protect its depositors.

Some of the acquired offices were closed due to close proximity existing Great Western branch offices. In August 1994, Great Western announced that it was selling 31 branches in the western portion of the state of Florida, which included Tampa- St. Petersburg, to First Union for $75 million to focus on other parts of Florida. =Expansion in Arizona= Great Western made its first expansion into the state of Arizona in June 1987 by announcing the pending acquisition of the Phoenix-based First Commercial Savings & Loan Association for $17 million in cash.

Ironically, in 1998 Washington Mutual acquired Ahmanson for $10 billion. In 2008, it became part of JPMorgan Chase. Advertising =Celebrity spokespersons= In October 1977, actor John Wayne filmed the first of several television commercials that he recorded over the next year for Great Western. In August 1978, Wayne, in full western garb, filmed the most famous of his commercials for the bank in the Sequoia National Forest. After Wayne's death in 1979, Great Western went through a number of celebrity spokespersons including Ben Johnson, Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck, Maureen O'Hara and John Huston before settling on Dennis Weaver who became their main spokesman from 1982 Alternate Link via ProQuest. until 1996. The tagline of the bank's advertising campaign during this time was \\"We'll Always Be There\\". =John Wayne statue= As a tribute to their most notable celebrity spokesman, Great Western commission in 1984 a full- sized bronze statue of the actor John Wayne by noted American western-motif sculptor Harry Jackson to stand in front of their then Beverly Hills headquarters at 8484 Wilshire Boulevard. The building was later sold after the company relocated their headquarters to Chatsworth in 1992. Magazine publisher Larry Flynt later obtained the building and statue in 1994. =Naming rights and sponsors= The Forum, an indoor arena in Inglewood, California, famous as the former home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings, was known as the \\"Great Western Forum\\" from 1988 to 2003. This name came from Great Western S&L;, which paid for the naming rights on the arena in 1988. While naming rights to sports arenas and stadiums are now commonplace, such a thing was quite rare at the time of the deal. The name still remained for six years after Great Western had ceased to exist. The 15-year naming rights contract expired in 2003, and the Great Western name was finally removed in 2006. Chase Bank, the successor to Great Western, is now the presenting sponsor of the Forum. More than ten years after the takeover, Great Western's logo was visible in several places at their former headquarters in Northridge.

It was written in French under the title Les bouts de bois de Dieu. The book deals with several ways that the Senegalese and Malians responded to colonialism. There are elements that tend toward accommodation, collaboration, or even idealization of the French colonials. At the same time the story details the strikers who work against the mistreatment of the Senegalese people.God's Bits of Wood ‚Äì Les bouts de bois de Dieu The novel was translated into English in 1962 and published by William Heinemann as God's Bits of Wood as part of their influential African Writers Series. Plot summary The action takes place in several locations‚Äîprimarily in Bamako, Thi√®s, and Dakar. The map at the beginning shows the locations and suggests that the story is about a whole country and all of its people. There is a large cast of characters associated with each place. Some are featured players‚ÄîFa Keita, Tiemoko, Maimouna, Ramatoulaye, Penda, Deune, N'Deye, Dejean, and Bakayoko. The fundamental conflict is captured in two characters: Dejean, the French manager and colonialist, and Bakayoko, the soul and spirit of the strike. In another sense, however, the main characters of the novel are the people as a collective and the railroad itself. The strike causes an evolution in the self-perception of the strikers themselves, one that is most noticeable in the women of Bamako, Thi√®s, and Dakar. These women go from merely standing behind the men to walking alongside them and eventually marching ahead of them. When the men are able to work the factory jobs that the railroad provides them, the women are responsible for running the markets, preparing the food, and rearing the children. But the onset of the strike gives the role of bread-winner ‚Äì or perhaps more precisely, bread scavenger ‚Äì to the women. Eventually it is the women that march on foot for over four days from Thi√®s to Dakar. Many of the men originally oppose the women's march, but it is precisely this show of determination from the marching women, who the French had earlier dismissed as \\"concubines\\", that makes the strikers' relentlessness clear. The women's march causes the French to understand the nature of the willpower that they are facing, and shortly after the French agree to the demands of the strikers. The book also highlights the oppression faced by women in the colonial era. They were deprived of their ability to speak on matters including society as a whole. Semb√®ne, however, raises women to a higher spectrum by considering them equally important. Historical significance The book came out in 1960, the year that Senegal achieved independence. The theme of unity is significant for the building of the newly independent nation.

It was built in 1950. Prior to the completion of the Huntington Civic Center (now known as Mountain Health Arena) in 1976, it was the only large arena in the city. It closed on February 10, 2012, and was demolished later that year.http://www.herald- dispatch.com/x173675451/So-long-Field-House The Fieldhouse was the home of the Marshall University basketball teams until the completion of the Cam Henderson Center in 1981. It also hosted the West Virginia public high school championships on a rotating basis with Charleston and Morgantown between 1962 and 1970, and the state Catholic championships every year from 1950 until the public and Catholic leagues were merged in 1979. Following the demise of the Catholic League, the local St. Joseph Catholic High School hosted the \\"St. Joe Invitational\\" which continued the tradition of skits and plays from that league. The arena was home to the International Hockey League's short-lived Huntington Hornets for the league's 1956‚Äì57 season. The team completed the season with a 26‚Äì30‚Äì4 record. The Hornets suffered from low attendance, prompting owner Ernie Berg to begin seeking a new home for the team as early as December, 1956. Local promoter Dick Deutsch attempted to save the team twice through local investments. Ultimately, the attempts fell short, and the team was slated for suspension of operations or relocation. The IHL eventually approved relocation of the franchise to Louisville, Kentucky, where the team was rebranded as the Rebels. It was the home of all high schools in the city until 1990 and was the home of St. Joseph High until 2011. It was the home of the Huntington Heroes American Indoor Football League team in 2005-06 before they moved to Big Sandy Superstore Arena. In addition, the venue also hosts several high school athletic events, including wrestling and basketball matches. In the aftermath of the November 14, 1970 Marshall University air tragedy, which claimed the lives of 75 Marshall University football team members, coaches, support staff, boosters and Southern Airways flight crew, the Fieldhouse was the site of a community memorial service on Sunday evening, November 15, 1970 that attracted an estimated 7,000 mourners to the arena. Main Corner Entrance 2008 With the completion of the two more modern facilities, the Fieldhouse was used primarily for smaller concert events. Also, the facility was built in an era when boxing was more popular and thus was designed around that sport and remained an excellent venue for boxing and professional wrestling. After Marshall moved out, the Fieldhouse started to fall into a state of disrepair. As of 2011, the aging structure was in need of significant roof repairs and interior renovations and had become a financial burden for its owner/operator, the Greater Huntington Park and Recreation District, which operated the arena at a financial loss. In April, 2011, the District Board voted unanimously to transfer the Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse property to Marshall University, which redeveloped the site as part of a $30 million athletic facilities project approved by the Marshall University Board of Governors. The only condition of the transfer was that the area be known as the \\"Veterans Memorial\\" area. Marshall University spent $5.4 million on the Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse phase of the facilities project, which included demolition of the 61-year-old venue and construction of Veterans Memorial Soccer Complex and veteran's memorial park on the site.http://www.herald- dispatch.com/mobile/x362868818/Governors-OK-30-million-plan To allow for the project, the university agreed to allow St. Joseph Catholic High School to move their home games to the Henderson Center, but then an NCAA ruling prohibiting regular season games in college owned venues was passed. A grand finale event for the 62-year-old venue - a Marshall University alumni basketball game and a veterans recognition ceremony - was held on February 10, 2012. The last shot ever in the building was made by Marshall great Russell Lee, and the crowd was addressed by the state's only living Medal of Honor recipient, Hershel W. Williams. Seating, signage and memorabilia were available for sale to the public through a silent auction of Fieldhouse memorabilia at and after the event. The most recent basketball floor (itself bought second hand from Marshall University when the current Henderson Center floor was installed and still bearing the markings from Marshall's Mid- American Conference era) was bought by the Big Sandy Superstore Arena. Ownership of the arena was transferred to Marshall University at the end of February, 2012.

Lyon-Perrache () is a large railway station located in the Perrache district, in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon, France. The station was opened in 1857 and is located on the Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway, Lyon‚ÄìGeneva railway and Moret‚ÄìLyon railway. The train services are operated by SNCF and include TGV, Intercity and local services. The station was built in 18 months starting in 1855 by Fran√ßois-Alexis Cendrier for the Chemin de fer de Paris √† Lyon. From the beginning it was designed as a central station unifying the lines of the three companies then serving Lyon, which merged to form the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM) as the station was opening. The building was built in classical style and is composed of a double rooftop and a large passenger building. The station lost its view of the city when an intermodal terminal (combining local public transit and intercity buses) and dual-carriageway highway were built in front of it in the 1970s. Although much modern building has somewhat tarnished the look of the area, the station retains many of its original features: *The station front features the names of towns served by trains departing Lyon-Perrache. *The platforms are covered by two twin iron rooftops. It is the terminus of the LGV Sud-Est line, the high-speed railway line from Paris. It is also served by conventional trains from other parts of France, and is the terminus of line of the Lyon Metro. It is also the terminus of one of the Lyon tram lines. Today, however, Perrache is no longer the primary rail station serving Lyon. Instead, the Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu, constructed in the 1970s in a large planned business district outside the central city, acts as the more popular embarkation point for most high-speed trains, especially to Paris and the north. Future A rebuilding of the station is planned for completion by 2020, with a view to improving the intermodal terminal, which by then will be 50 years old.

Biography Helen Mary Elizabeth Paterson was born on 26 September 1848, at Swadlincote in Derbyshire, the daughter of Alexander Henry Paterson, a medical doctor, and Mary Herford Paterson. Helen was the eldest of seven children. The year after her birth the family moved to Altrincham in Cheshire. In 1862 her father and her three-year-old sister Isabel died of diphtheria during an epidemic. The remaining family then moved to Birmingham, where some of Alexander Paterson's family lived. Paterson showed a talent for art from an early age, drawing some of her inspiration from her maternal grandmother Sarah Smith Herford and aunt Laura Herford, both accomplished artists of their day. Her younger sister Caroline Paterson also became a noted artist. She initially studied art for three years at the Birmingham School of Design. She spent a year at the Royal Female School of Art in London, before following her aunt Laura Herford to the National Art Training School. In 1867 she enrolled in the Royal Academy School, which would later become the Royal College of Art.. Career The saucer of milk Allingham's watercolour painting of Craigenputtock, the home of Thomas Carlyle While studying at the National Art Training School, Paterson worked as an illustrator, eventually deciding to give up her studies in favour of a full-time career in art. She painted for children'sAllingham illustrated Juliana Ewing's Six to Sixteen: a story for girls (1876) and A Flat Iron for a Farthing and adult books, as well as for periodicals, including The Graphic newspaper. One highlight was her commission to provide twelve illustrations for the 1874 serialisation of Thomas Hardy's novel Far from the Madding Crowd in Cornhill Magazine. Her illustrations from this era were signed either \\"H. Paterson\\" or \\"H. Allingham\\". She became a lifelong friend of Kate Greenaway whom she met at evening art classes at the Slade School of Fine Art. While Vincent Van Gogh was developing as an artist by studying English illustrated journals he was struck by Paterson's work in The Graphic. Although females could not gain the same recognition as men at the time, Helen Allingham was one of the women artists who made a considerable impact, as artists like Van Gogh were influenced by her. On 22 August 1874 she married William Allingham, Irish poet and editor of Fraser's Magazine, who was almost twice her age. After her marriage, she gave up her career as an illustrator and turned to watercolour painting. In 1881 the family moved from Chelsea to Witley in Surrey. Her first son, Gerald Carlyle, was born in November 1875. Her daughter was born on 21 February 1877 and her last son on 11 May 1882. Helen started to paint the countryside around her and particularly the picturesque farmhouses and cottages of Surrey and Sussex for which she became famous. However, her works were criticized as \\"overly sentimental, conservative vision of the area\\".Alison Light, Mrs Woolf and the Servants (2007) p. 102 She went on to paint rural scenes in other parts of the country ‚Äì Middlesex, Kent, the Isle of Wight and the West Country ‚Äì and abroad in Venice, Italy. As well as landscapes, she completed several portraits, including one of Thomas Carlyle. In 1890, she became the first woman to be admitted as a full member of the Royal Watercolour Society. Allingham exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Legacy The Helen Allingham Society was founded in 2000.The Helen Allingham Society Her time in Altrincham is commemorated by blue plaques at 16 Market Street, Altrincham and at Levenhurst, St. John's Road, Bowdon.

Keggy the Keg is the unofficial mascot of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League college in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Keggy is an anthropomorphic beer keg, created in 2003 by members of the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, to fill the mascot void that followed the abolition of the Indian mascot in 1971. Due to its nature, the mascot was controversial on Dartmouth's campus, and it was reported on in a variety of national media. With time, however, it has become an \\"ingrained part of Dartmouth culture\\".  Context and creation  After dropping the mascot of the Indian, Dartmouth had no official mascot. Dartmouth continued to be known by its nickname of \\"The Big Green,\\" but, citing the ambiguity, lack of dynamism, and intangibility of having no mascot, the Dartmouth Student Assembly proposed a student poll in spring 2003 to decide upon a new mascot. While the Moose came in first in this poll, many students remained dissatisfied with the choice, and the moose lost a final poll to \\"no mascot.\\" Chris Plehal and Nic Duquette, students at the Jack-O- Lantern humor magazine, expressed interest in creating a mascot that \\"wasn't racist, biased or sexist, yet [was] entirely unacceptable.\\" In an effort to force the administration to adopt a more interesting mascot, they created Keggy, an anthropomorphic keg that represents \\"the most obvious Dartmouth stereotype: the beer-swilling Animal House fraternity culture.\\"  Reactions  Reaction to Keggy's introduction was mixed: the student body president personally endorsed Keggy in the mascot search, while the College newspaper The Dartmouth reported a mixed student reaction and published opposing opinions. The paper also reported on \\"flak\\" over the mascot from College administrators, though the Dean of the College lauded the students' capacity to \\"come up with imaginative and creative ideas.\\" The new incarnation of Keggy, as revealed at Winter Carnival 2009 Keggy subsequently received media attention beyond the College at other Ivy League newspapers and on several national media outlets. Michael Wilbon of ESPN's Pardon the Interruption called Keggy \\"some stupid beer thing,\\" and Playboy magazine published a feature on Keggy as part of a \\"Mascots Talk Back\\" series. A posting of a photo of Keggy on CollegeHumor was popular enough to receive status as a National Pick. In August, 2012 Yahoo Sports ranked Keggy the Keg as the #1 Most Unique Mascot.https://sports.yahoo.com/news/college-football-top-25-most-unique- mascots-222600966--ncaaf.html  History  Shortly after Keggy's introduction in 2003, a group of students stole the Keggy costume from its home in the Sigma Nu fraternity library and sent threatening notes to Keggy's creators, including photographs of the mascot bound and gagged with one black eye. Some thought this to be a publicity stunt by the creators, but the mascot had truly been stolen. Keggy was eventually returned with minor damage to the costume. Keggy continued to make occasional appearances at Dartmouth sporting events, and became an \\"ingrained part of Dartmouth culture\\": at Dartmouth's 2005 Winter Carnival celebration, students named the snow sculpture of a large ship \\"Captain Keggy's Carnival Cruiser.\\" In early 2006, College officials denied Keggy entrance to a sold-out hockey game (officials cited fire code concerns with the capacity crowd), prompting a Jack-O-Lantern-penned editorial in The Dartmouth condemning the incident; the Jack-O-Lantern website alleged \\"anti- keg racism.\\" A similar incident occurred in October 2006 when Keggy was not permitted on the field at halftime of the Homecoming football game, again resulting in further complaints in The Dartmouth and on the Jack-O-Lantern website. The costume disappeared before the fall term of 2008 and has not been seen or returned since. The Jack-O-Lantern built a replacement costume and unveiled it at the 2009 Winter Carnival.

Discovered by Zdenƒõk Moravec at the Kle≈• Observatory in 1996, it was later named after J√°ra Cimrman, a Czech fictional character.  Discovery  J√°racimrman was discovered by Zdenƒõk Moravec at the Kle≈• Observatory in the Czech Republic, on 16 January 1996 and was initially designated . Observations continued until April 1996, and then again between June and July 1997. The asteroid was later determined to be a lost asteroid which had previously been observed twice: at the Brera-Merate Observatory in northern Italy on 12 December 1973, and at Mount Stromlo Observatory, near Canberra, Australia, on 8 and 9 July 1990.  Classification and orbit  The asteroid is a member of the Adeona family (), a large family of carbonaceous asteroids. In 1997, J√°racimrmans orbit was calculated more precisely by additional observatories and it could therefore be numbered as asteroid 7796, the 312th recognized (numbered) asteroid discovered at the Kle≈• Observatory. Moravec suggested naming it after the fictional Czech polymath J√°ra Cimrman.  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, J√°racimrman measures 11.312 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.055, which is typical for carbonaceous C-type asteroids. However, no spectral data is available for the asteroid, thus neither its chemical nor mineralogical composition is currently known. In addition, no rotational lightcurve has been obtained of J√°racimrman as of 2017.  Naming  The citation accompanying the suggestion said: \\"Named for J√°ra Cimrman, a fictitious Czech genius. An analogue to Leonardo da Vinci, he was a playwright, composer, poet, painter, versatile scientist, inventor, polar explorer, sportsman, first man on the moon, etc. Although his name is not mentioned in any encyclopedia, his work is explored at the J√°ra Cimrman Theatre in Prague. This theatre is headed by the famous cimrmanologists Z. Svƒõr√°k and L. Smoljak, who endorsed the name proposal.\\" The name was approved by International Astronomical Union (IAU) Committee on Small Body Nomenclature and published on 11 February 1998 ().

Renata Borgatti (March 2, 1894 ‚Äì March 8, 1964) was an Italian classical musician, performing in Europe and the United States. Early life She was the daughter of the great Wagnerian tenor Giuseppe Borgatti (1871‚Äì1950), whose imposing career at Milan's La Scala opera house was ended by blindness. Trained initially as a ballerina, she abandoned dance to become a concert pianist, specialising in the works of Claude Debussy. Relationships A lesbian, she settled on the Mediterranean island of Capri in the early 1900s, where her lifestyle raised fewer eyebrows than elsewhere in Europe. In 1918, she entered into a lesbian affair with an Italian socialite (and baroness) Mim√¨ Franchetti. The two remained together for just over a year, until Franchetti left Capri and linked with the prominent American artist Romaine Brooks. Borgatti had an affair with Faith Compton Mackenzie,Infinite variety: the life and legend of the Marchesa Casati By Scot D. Ryersson, Michael Orlando Yaccarino, p99 whose husband Compton Mackenzie wrote of the island's lesbian residents in the 1928 satirical roman √† clef Extraordinary Women, about a group of lesbians arriving on the island of Sirene, a fictional version of Capri. In 1920, Borgatti left Capri to pursue her career on the European mainland. She also began a romantic liaison with Brooks, who was by that time pursuing a relationship with the American writer Natalie Barney. Borgatti's affair with Brooks proceeded on and off for at least three years, but was curtailed when Brooks began avoiding her. During the early-1920s, she became intimately involved with Winnaretta Singer, heiress to the Singer sewing machine fortune. Career She performed on stage with the violinist Olga Rudge during this period. They worked frequently together, despite the presence of Rudge's lover, the famous poet Ezra Pound, who was then working as a music critic. Pound was not impressed by Borgatti's playing, describing it as \\"plonking\\". Like many musicians of the day, she disliked Pound, due mostly to the inconsistency in his assessments. Irrespective of Pound's disregard for Borgatti's musical talents, and her disregard for him, she and Rudge continued to play together for several years: it is likely that they simply shared the same musical tastes. Borgatti later taught music, dying in Rome of leukemia in 1964. References External links *Renata Borgatti, images.

Truth is freely mingled with fiction, and there is a generalizing purpose to exhibit the psychic disease that affected the whole generation of the transition from romanticism to realism in life and art. The work stands with Adalbert Stifter's Der Nachsommer as one of the two most important examples of a Bildungsroman. Plot Green Henry details the life of Heinrich Lee from childhood through his first romantic encounters, his fledgling attempts at becoming a painter in Munich, and his eventual installation as a chancery clerk. The story gets its name from the color that Heinrich affected in dress. Heinrich is a Swiss burgher's son, brought up too tenderly by a widowed mother. After youthful pranks and experiences, and a not altogether justified dismissal from school, he idles away some time in his mother's village. He determines to be a painter, and goes to Munich's artistic Bohemia. From there, he finds his way to a count's mansion, and then he returns home to his dying mother and an all-too-tardy and brief repentance. The much revised second version has Heinrich abandoning art to enter the civil service. This experience affords occasion for extended political reflections. The tone of the reminiscences makes it clear that Keller would have the reader understand that Heinrich has lived through and risen out of his instability and irresolution and sees life steadily and cheerfully at last. Development Green Henry was written from 1850 to 1855. It is the most personal of all of Keller's works, and is significantly influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's doctrine of a return to nature. At first intended as a short narrative of the collapse of the life of a young artist, the book expanded as its composition progressed into a huge work that treats, in poetically transfigured manner, all the events in Keller's life up to his return to Z√ºrich in 1842. Its reception by the literary world was cool, but after a revised edition was issued in 1879, it won general and often extravagant praise. Evaluation Benjamin W. Wells reviewed the book so: > Keen insight, fresh humor and instinct for realistic narration are its > outstanding merits; its faults are lack of proportion, occasional garrulity > and obtruded moralizing, but most of all the doubt that it leaves in the > reader whether the Heinrich who had shown such persistent lack of character, > especially in his relations with his mother, would so quickly be capable of > discovering, rather than recovering, a normal balance of mind. Jacob Wittmer Hartmann characterizes the 2nd edition of 1879 and a ‚Äúrounded and satisfying artistic product.‚Äù The New International Encyclop√¶dia praises the 2nd edition as a significant improvement over the first.

They formed in March 1994 and played regularly around the live music scene and toured both nationally and internationally. They have released seven studio albums, Less Is More (10 June 1996), Come Again (28 September 1998), A Different High (14 May 2001), Free Kicks (6 June 2004), Even (29 March 2008), In Another Time (9 December 2011), and Satin Returns (16 May 2018). A Different High peaked at No. 48 on the ARIA Albums Chart. History Future members of Even, Matthew Cotter on drums and Ashley Naylor on lead vocals and lead guitar, played music together at a high school in Melbourne. They formed an indie band, The Swarm, with Francis Leach on vocals and David Rowland on bass guitar. The Swarm issued three independent singles between November 1988 and April 1991 before disbanding. In March 1994 Cotter and Naylor were joined by Roderick \\"Wally\\" Kempton (also a member of The Meanies, as Wally Meanie) on bass guitar to form an indie guitar pop group, Even. From 1993 to 1997 Naylor was also a member of another indie pop group, Rail (originally named Sleeper, then Fragment and finally Rail), which issued two albums, Bad Hair Life (1995) and Goodbye Surfing Hello God! (1997). Naylor is a fan of 1960s and 1970s pop music. Even played their first gig in March 1994 at the Empress of India Hotel in Fitzroy. Ten years later Naylor told Michael Dwyer of The Age that \\"It was very exciting, because we did a soundcheck and people were applauding us... We were bristling to play, absolutely bursting with energy. Flaming youth, Kiss would have called it.\\" Even signed to an independent label, Rubber Records, home to The Casanovas, Offcuts and 1200 Techniques. In May 1995 Even issued a six- track extended play, In Stereo, on Rubber and distributed by Shock Records. It was produced by Andy Baldwin, Andy O'Beirne, Lindsay Gravina and Bruce Mowson. National youth radio station, Triple J, added the track, \\"24 Hour Cynic\\", to high rotation. In late 1996 they provided a live-in-the-studio version of \\"24 Hour Cynic\\" for a various artists' compilation, Triple J ‚Äì Live. Even followed in November 1995 with a five-track EP, Ten to Forty-Six, which included the lead track, \\"Stupid Dream\\". The band released their first studio album, Less Is More, on 10 June 1996 via Rubber Records/Shock Records. It was co-produced by Even with Greg Wales (Drop City) and mixed by Wales with Nick Launay. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was \\"brimming with exceptional tunes ('Karmic Flop', 'Stop and Go Man', 'Dear Morris', 'She Told Me So' and 'Eternal Teen' to name but a handful), a timeless feel and pop hooks by the truckload.\\" He declared that the group had released \\"one of the best Australian debut albums of 1996.\\" Less Is More provided three singles, \\"Don't Wait\\" (June), \\"Stop and Go Man\\" (September) and \\"Peaches and Cream\\" (February 1997). After supporting international acts, The Presidents of the United States, The Posies, Ash and Everclear, in Australia; Even toured the United States and then Europe from March 1997. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 in September Less Is More was nominated for Best Independent Release. In November 1997 they issued a third EP, One Side Not, with four tracks. It was recorded at Seed Studios by Wales with Tim Johnston. The group issued their second studio album, Come Again, on 28 September 1998, which was produced by Tony Lash (The Dandy Warhols, Eric Matthews). McFarlane felt it \\"fulfilled the promise of the debut with its full quota of bright guitar melodies and top- flight songs.\\" AllMusic's James Damas described it as \\"one of the most overlooked and consistent rock & roll albums of the late '90s.\\" Tim Rogers of fellow Australian group, You Am I, quipped that it was his \\"favourite Beatles album\\". It provided three singles, \\"No Surprises\\" (August 1998), \\"Black Umbrella\\" (November) and \\"Sunshine Comes\\" (September 1999). From early 1999 Naylor collaborated with alternative country artist, Sherry Rich, to form a folk pop duo, The Grapes. They issued a self-titled album in October which McFarlane observed was \\"full of rich sixties melodies, catchy guitar hooks, perfect harmonies, jangling guitars and country influences.\\" Even's third studio album, A Different High, was issued on 14 May 2001, which peaked at No. 48 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and reached No. 10 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. Guesting on the album were Ren√©e Geyer on vocals, Graham Lee (ex-The Triffids) on pedal steel guitar and Bruce Haymes (of Paul Kelly Band) on organ, piano and Wurlitzer. Damas opined that for A Different High, \\"the scales begin to tip more heavily toward the more bloated side of '70s classic rock and away from modern pop.\\" David Simons of OnStage Magazine noticed that it \\"finds Naylor sharpening the hooks, tightening the grooves, and multiplying the guitar sounds like never before. The result is an album's worth of the most tuneful pop you're likely to find on any continent.\\" The album's lead single, \\"Shining Star\\" (April 2001), peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart. Their fourth studio album, Free Kicks, appeared on 6 June 2004 on their own label, El Reno Records, and distributed by Shock Records. They had recorded some of the tracks in the United Kingdom in 2002. Dwyer declared that it \\"spearheads a new lease of life for Even... it features a couple of guest appearances by former Small Faces/Faces keyboard player Ian McLagan and follows a watershed London adventure.\\" For the Hoodoo Gurus tribute album, Stoneage Cameos (August 2005), Even covered \\"Arthur\\", with Kempton as co- executive producer with Jason Evans. In June 2008 Even's debut album Less Is More was voted number 30 of the greatest Australian albums ever in a poll by The Age readers. Ned Raggett of AllMusic reviewed their self-titled, fifth studio album which showed they \\"love their Beatles, their ELO, their power pop, their hints of roots music appreciation. It's all in there and they're not only not hiding it; they revel in it.\\" Even was issued on 29 March 2008, which the group co-produced with Wayne Connolly (You Am I). Even released their sixth studio album, In Another Time, on 9 December 2011. Mess+Noise's Patrick Emery felt it displayed how \\"a celebration of the glorious riffs, melodies and elegant style of the '60s and '70s doesn‚Äôt need to be an exercise in turgid nostalgia.\\" Edouard Morton of theDwarf.com.au caught their live gig in May 2012 at The Tote, where they \\"made an all out attempt to burst every eardrum with their endlessly popular, and recognisably Melbourne power rock.\\" In December 2014 the group celebrated their 14th annual Xmas Even at the Gasometer Hotel (in Collingwood) with Jasmin Kaset as their support act. In May 2018, Even released their seventh studio album, Satin returns.

A. Rogers in 1906 sees the political uses of Oz: he depicts William Randolph Hearst as Scarecrow stuck in his own Ooze in Harper's Weekly Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz include treatments of the modern fairy tale (written by L. Frank Baum and first published in 1900) as an allegory or metaphor for the political, economic, and social events of America in the 1890s. Scholars have examined four quite different versions of Oz: the novel of 1900, the Broadway play of 1901, the Hollywood film of 1939, and the numerous follow-up Oz novels written after 1900 by Baum and others. The political interpretations focus on the first three, and emphasize the close relationship between the visual images and the story line to the political interests of the day. Biographers report that Baum had been a political activist in the 1890s with a special interest in the money question of gold and silver (bimetallism), and the illustrator William Wallace Denslow was a full-time editorial cartoonist for a major daily newspaper. For the 1901 Broadway production Baum inserted explicit references to prominent political characters such as President Theodore Roosevelt. Monetary policy In a 1964 article, educator and historian Henry Littlefield outlined an allegory in the book of the late-19th-century debate regarding monetary policy. According to this view, for instance, the Yellow Brick Road represents the gold standard, and the Silver Shoes (Ruby slippers in the 1939 film version) represent the Silverite sixteen to one silver ratio (dancing down the road). The City of Oz earns its name from the abbreviation of ounces \\"Oz\\" in which gold and silver are measured. The thesis achieved considerable popular interest and elaboration by many scholars in history, economics and other fields, but that thesis has been challenged. Certainly the 1901 musical version of Oz, written by Baum, was for an adult audience and had numerous explicit references to contemporary politics, though in these references Baum seems just to have been \\"playing for laughs\\". The 1902 stage adaptation mentioned, by name, President Theodore Roosevelt and other political celebrities. For example, the Tin Woodman wonders what he would do if he ran out of oil. \\"You wouldn't be as badly off as John D. Rockefeller\\", the Scarecrow responds, \\"He'd lose six thousand dollars a minute if that happened.\\" Littlefield's knowledge of the 1890s was thin, and he made numerous errors, but since his article was published, scholars in history, political science, and economics have asserted that the images and characters used by Baum closely resemble political images that were well known in the 1890s. Quentin Taylor, for example, claimed that many of the events and characters of the book resemble the actual political personalities, events and ideas of the 1890s. Dorothy‚Äîna√Øve, young and simple‚Äîrepresents the American people. She is Everyman, led astray and seeking the way back home. Moreover, following the road of gold leads eventually only to the Emerald City, which may symbolize the fraudulent world of greenback paper money that only pretends to have value. It is ruled by a scheming politician (the Wizard) who uses publicity devices and tricks to fool the people (and even the Good Witches) into believing he is benevolent, wise, and powerful when really he is a selfish, evil humbug. He sends Dorothy into severe danger hoping she will rid him of his enemy the Wicked Witch of the West. He is powerless and, as he admits to Dorothy, \\"I'm a very bad Wizard\\". Hugh Rockoff suggested in 1990 that the novel was an allegory about the demonetization of silver in 1873, whereby ‚Äúthe cyclone that carried Dorothy to the Land of Oz represents the economic and political upheaval, the yellow brick road stands for the gold standard, and the silver shoes Dorothy inherits from the Wicked Witch of the East represents the pro-silver movement. When Dorothy is taken to the Emerald Palace before her audience with the Wizard she is led through seven passages and up three flights of stairs, a subtle reference to the Coinage Act of 1873 which started the class conflict in America.‚ÄùHugh Rockoff, ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòWizard of Oz‚Äô as a Monetary Allegory,‚Äù Journal of Political Economy 98.4 (1990), as summarized by William L. Silber in The Story of Silver: How the White Metal Shapes America and the Modern World (Princeton University Press, 2019), 25‚Äì26. Social groups Historian Quentin Taylor sees additional metaphors, including: *The Scarecrow as a representation of American farmers and their troubles in the late 19th century *The Tin Man representing the industrial workers, especially those of American steel industries *The Cowardly Lion as a metaphor for William Jennings Bryan Taylor also claimed a sort of iconography for the cyclone: it was used in the 1890s as a metaphor for a political revolution that would transform the drab country into a land of color and unlimited prosperity. It was also used by editorial cartoonists of the 1890s to represent political upheaval. Dorothy would represent the goodness and innocence of human kind. Other putative allegorical devices of the book include the Wicked Witch of the West as a figure for the actual American West; if this is true, then the Winged Monkeys could represent another western danger: Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells Dorothy, \\"Once we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. ... This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.\\" In fact, Baum proposed in two editorials he wrote in December 1890 for his newspaper, the Saturday Pioneer, the total genocidal slaughter of all remaining indigenous peoples. \\"The Whites,\\" Baum wrote, \\"by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation?\\" However this may have been sarcastic or a rhetorical question, as he also wrote \\"An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that 'when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.'\\" The beginning of his Saturday Pioneer editorial in 1890 also seems sympathetic to Sitting Bull: \\"He was an Indian with a white man's spirit of hatred and revenge for those who had wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe gradually driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.\\" Alternative allegory Other writers have used the same evidence to lead to precisely opposite allegorical interpretations. Apart from intentional symbolism, scholars have speculated on the sources of Baum's ideas and imagery. The \\"man behind the curtain\\" could be a reference to automated store window displays of the sort famous at Christmas season in big city department stores; many people watching the fancy clockwork motions of animals and mannequins thought there must be an operator behind the curtain pulling the levers to make them move (Baum was the editor of the trade magazine read by window dressers). Additional allegories have been developed, without claims that they were originally intended by Baum. The text has been treated as a theosophical allegory. In 1993, W. Geoffrey Seeley recast the story as an exercise in treachery, suggesting the supposed \\"Good Witch Glinda\\" used an innocent, ignorant patsy (Dorothy) to overthrow both her own sister witch (Witch of the West) and the Wizard of Oz, leaving herself as undisputed master of all four corners of Oz: North, East, West and South (and presumably the Emerald City). She even showed her truest \\"Machiavellian brilliance\\" by allowing the story to be entitled after the weakest of her three opponents. Glinda could have told Dorothy that the \\"silver slippers would easily do the job [of returning Dorothy to her beloved home] but decided that a destabilizing force such as Dorothy might be just the thing to shake up her other rival [The Wizard of Oz].\\" Kassinger, in her book Gold: From Greek Myth to Computer Chips, purports that \\"The Wizard symbolizes bankers who support the gold standard and oppose adding silver to it... Only Dorothy's silver slippers can take her home to Kansas,\\" meaning that by Dorothy not realizing that she had the silver slippers the whole time, Dorothy, or \\"the westerners\\", never realized they already had a viable currency of the people. Canadian author Margaret Atwood has linked Donald Trump's election in 2016 to the Wizard: \\"the wizard is the president-elect. He has no magic powers\\".Margaret Atwood, \\"Just like the Wizard of Oz, Donald Trump has no magic powers: Voters who put on the glasses of illusion now want to go back to normal life, but there are no ruby slippers,\\" The Guardian 11 Nov 2016 Mar√≠a Teresa Gibert Maceda, \\"Margaret Atwood‚Äôs Visions and Revisions of 'The Wizard of Oz'.\\" Journal of English Studies 17 (2019): 175-195.

He first emerged as a rapper, releasing his debut album, Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, in 2006. His second studio album, The Defamation of Strickland Banks (2010), was a soul and R&B; album, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. He has also collaborated with other artists such as Chase & Status, most notably on the 2009 top ten single \\"End Credits\\". Drew has also had a successful film career as an actor, with roles in Adulthood (2008), Harry Brown (2009), 4.3.2.1. (2010) and The Sweeney (2012). In 2012, he released the film Ill Manors, which he wrote and directed, accompanied by a Plan B soundtrack album which became his second number one album. Early life Drew was born and raised in Forest Gate, London. His mother worked for a local authority and his father, Paul Ballance, played in a punk rock band called the Warm Jets during the 1970s. He was five months old when his father walked out on the family, and six years old when his father \\"disappeared completely\\". Growing up, Drew felt outcast from much of society, stating, \\"We weren't working class but we weren't middle class, we were in the void in-between. I've always felt like a social outcast.\\" From 11, Drew attended the Anglo European School in Ingatestone, Essex. He later transferred to Tom Hood School before being expelled and sent to Tunmarsh Pupil Referral Unit in Newham, London, for children unable to attend mainstream school. He finally left school with three GCSEs. He taught himself how to play guitar at 14, first playing Blur and Oasis songs with friends, then going on to write his own R&B; love songs. At 18, feeling uncomfortable with R&B;, he turned towards rap and hip hop and wrote \\"Kidz\\", inspired by the murder of Damilola Taylor. Drew explained his stage name during an appearance on USA Today in 2007, stating, \\"The whole reason for calling myself Plan B was that I was doing this sweet-boy Justin Timberlake shit, but I never felt comfortable... when I started rapping, it was easier for me to feel comfortable.\\" Music career =2005‚Äì09: Early career and debut album= Plan B first appeared with the track \\"Cap Back\\", produced by DJ Wonder (formerly of Roll Deep), on the grime compilation album Run the Road (2005). His first single \\"Kidz\\"/\\"Dead and Buried\\" was also released in 2005 as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl on his own label Pet Cemetery Records. He soon gained a recording contract with 679 Recordings and released his second double A-side single \\"Sick 2 Def\\"/\\"No Good\\", filming his debut music video for \\"No Good\\". In early 2006, Plan B released a video-only download single for \\"Missing Links\\", which later had to be re-recorded because he did not gain sample permission from Radiohead for the use of \\"Pyramid Song\\". He also released his first mixtape It's Time 4 Plan B with the May 2006 issue of Hip Hop Connection magazine. On 23 June 2006, Plan B made his first television appearance on Later... with Jools Holland, performing an acoustic version of \\"Mama (Loves a Crackhead)\\". His d√©but album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words was recorded with producers Paul Epworth, Fraser T Smith and the Earlies, and was released 26 June 2006, charting the following week at number thirty on the UK Albums Chart. The album gained positive reviews from most critics, including a five-star review from The Guardian's Alexis Petridis. In July 2006, \\"Mama (Loves a Crackhead)\\" was released as a single, becoming the first Plan B song to appear on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number forty one. In 2006, Paul Epworth and Plan B collaborated again on the track \\"More Is Enough\\" by Epic Man (Paul Epworth). the Arches, Glasgow (2007)alt= Image of Plan B playing guitar at a concert After touring throughout 2006, playing at festivals such as Reading and Leeds, a music video was filmed for \\"No More Eatin'\\" to accompany the release of Plan B's Live at The Pet Cemetery EP on 30 October 2006 (including a new version of \\"No More Eatin'\\" and two b-sides). On 11 December 2006, he released the Remixes EP (which included the Hadouken! remix of \\"No More Eatin'\\"). During his January‚ÄìFebruary 2007 tour (which included support from Professor Green, Example, Killa Kela and Hadouken!), Plan B released his second mixtape Paint It Blacker, containing bootleg recordings of songs by artists such as the Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Radiohead, Coldplay, Leonard Cohen and Jos√© Gonz√°lez with producers Sem, Beni G from the Mixologists and Amir Amor. In 2007, Plan B re-released the song \\"No Good\\" with new remixes, and a music video was filmed for the b-side \\"Bizness Woman\\" (featuring beatboxer Kila Kella). Also in 2007, Plan B featured on songs by other artists such as Professor Green, Killa Kela, Skrein, Shameless and the Mitchell Brothers. With a supporting role in the film Adulthood (2008), Plan B recorded three songs for the film‚Äôs soundtrack ‚Äì \\"End in the Streets\\", \\"On It 08\\" with Adam Deacon and \\"I Need Love\\" featuring Raleigh Ritchie. Plan B also featured on the Chase & Status single \\"Pieces\\", which topped the UK Dance Chart in 2008 and peaked at number seventy on the UK Singles Chart. In 2009, Plan B recorded \\"Shifty\\" with Riz MC and Sway, which was lifted from the soundtrack to Eran Creevy‚Äôs film Shifty (2009), starring Riz Ahmed (Riz MC) and Daniel Mays. Also in 2009, Plan B played Noel Winters in Harry Brown, and achieved his first Top ten hit single with \\"End Credits\\", another collaboration with Chase & Status which featured in the soundtrack for Harry Brown. '''''''' =2009‚Äìpresent: Strickland Banks era and Ill Manors= Plan B's second album and film The Defamation of Strickland Banks was released on 12 April 2010. The lead single from the album, \\"Stay Too Long\\", reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The next single from the album, \\"Love Goes Down\\", was accompanied by an official music video featuring Andy Crane, Paul Young, Abbey M. Butler, Vicky McClure and Kaya Scodelario, which had its own premiere on 16 November 2010. He supported Noel Gallagher on the second night of his solo shows at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 March 2010, and played in Bangor at the Radio 1 Big Weekend on 23 May 2010 on the New Music We Trust stage. He performed a duet of \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\" with Elton John as part of Elton's BBC Electric Proms performance at the Roundhouse in London in October 2010. On 16 February 2011, Drew won Best British Male at the Brit Awards. Later that year he announced that he was working on a new album called The Ballad of Belmarsh, which was to be a hip-hop concept album telling the story of Plan B's alter-ego, Strickland Banks. Work on the album was later put on hold to focus on the film Ill Manors and it was ultimately shelved completely. In March 2012, he released the single and video for \\"Ill Manors\\", a song (containing a sample from Peter Fox's \\"Alles Neu\\") which deals with the 2011 London Riots, and which was described by The Guardian as \\"the first great mainstream protest song in years\\". A soundtrack album and film of the same name (Drew's first as both writer and director) were released in June 2012, followed by three more singles: \\"Lost My Way\\", \\"Deepest Shame\\" and \\"Playing with Fire\\". In July 2012, Drew issued an apology after he appeared on the cover of Shortlist magazine wearing a t-shirt featuring white supremacist rock band Skrewdriver. Drew produced \\"Pray for Love\\" by Kwabs, released on 6 May 2014. On May 18, 2017, Drew released his first single in 5 years titled \\"In The Name Of Man\\" and announced that he had been in the studio recording an album via Twitter. The album, Heaven Before All Hell Breaks Loose, was released on April 13, 2018. He said in an interview that this album is less hip-hop orientated than his first two albums \\"....because I feel that I‚Äôm not being honest with myself if I‚Äôm living the high life and I‚Äôm trying to rap about the other side of things\\". Drew said that he had taken time off from the music industry to focus on fatherhood, and also to connect with friends and family he says he felt alienated from after the release of Ill Manors. \\"I felt spiritually lost at the end of Ill Manors. I hadn‚Äôt seen my family, really, since 2009. Certain friendships were just completely dissolving. I‚Äôd always felt like I was fighting to be taken seriously, fighting for recognition, and suddenly I had it all, and I thought, ‚ÄòShit, I‚Äôve got nothing to fight for.'\\" Film career =Acting= After previously appearing in Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's short film Walking After Acconci (Redirected Approaches) in 2005, Drew's first major film role was as a supporting character (Dabs) in Noel Clarke's Adulthood (2008). His song \\"Kidz\\" was previously included in the soundtrack to Kidulthood (2006), which led to Drew being cast in the sequel. In 2009, Drew had another supporting role as Noel Winters in the Daniel Barber film Harry Brown, starring Michael Caine. In 2010, Drew appeared in Noel Clarke's film 4.3.2.1.. Drew's most recent role has been co-starring in The Sweeney film, based on the '70s UK TV show of the same name, alongside Ray Winstone, playing the role of George Carter. The film was released on 12 September 2012 and went straight in at number 1 in the box office charts. =Directing= Drew expressed an interest in working in film early in his music career. In an interview about Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, he said: \\"We're still promoting this album and I've started work on the next one, but I'm really getting into film at the moment. I'm writing this script, and I really want to find some time to focus on it, I really feel that's what I'm destined to be doing\\". In 2008, Drew directed his first short film Michelle, which starred Adam Deacon and Skrein. He also directed the music video for \\"Pieces\\" (his collaboration with Chase & Status). Drew began production on his first full-length feature film, Ill Manors, in September 2010. Speaking in March 2010 to UK soul-writer Pete Lewis (Deputy Editor of the award-winning Blues & Soul), Drew described 'Ill Manors': \\"It's a hip hop, music-based feature film which has six short stories that all kinda mix together to make one BIG story ‚Äì and each mini-story will be represented by a different hip hop track. It'll all be narrated by me, and it'll actually be the reverse of 'The Defamation Of Strickland Banks' ‚Äì in that with 'Ill Manors', the film will come out first and the soundtrack will come afterwards. And again the soundtrack will be a film for the blind, in that you'll be able to listen to it and it'll tell you the story of the film.\\" Advertising In June 2011, Hewlett-Packard signed up Plan B as part of their advertising campaign for their Beats Audio laptops, using a short film exclusive to UK cinemas which showed Plan B with his band in a recording studio deconstructing the song \\"She Said\\", which had been a UK chart success a year earlier. Subsequently, in its 24 June issue, the British satirical magazine Private Eye made reference to the ad in its Ad Nauseam column, voicing the magazine's view that Plan B's involvement in the commercial seemed to be at odds with his comments at the Ivor Novello Awards regarding music promotion, where he criticised what \\"‚Ä¶has to go on in order to get your music to get played to the masses\\" (in reference to his own US stage tour just prior to the awards). In July 2011, Bulmer's cider announced that they had signed up Plan B to promote their product, releasing an advert which depicted a live performance by Plan B.

Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an \\"Open House\\"). During the Open House, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a \\"House of the Lord,\\" after which only members twelve years of age and olderPer a Church policy determination in December 2018, those turning twelve any given year may also be given a temple recommend if found worthy by their bishops. who hold a current and valid temple recommend are permitted entrance; temples are not churches but are places of worship. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple, built in 2002 and based on the original Nauvoo Temple that was built in 1846 and destroyed in 1848 Chart of temple construction as of April 2020 Within temples, members of the church make covenants, receive instructions, and perform sacred ordinances, such as: baptism for the dead, washing and anointing (or \\"initiatory\\" ordinances), the \\"endowment,\\" and eternal marriage sealings. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all dispensations. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to commune with God, seek His aid, understand His will, and receive personal revelation. History The Mesa Arizona Temple, one of three patterned after the Temple of Solomon In 1832, shortly after the formation of the church, Joseph Smith said that the Lord desired the saints build a temple;Recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, Smith wrote that the Lord commanded the Saints to \\"establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;\\" (see ) and they completed the Kirtland Temple in 1836. Initially, the church constructed temples in areas where there were large concentrations of members: Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Hawaii (all in the USA), and Alberta (Canada). In the mid 20th century, because of the importance of temples in the theology, the church tried to balance density with the travel requirements attending the temple imposed upon members. Thus, temples were built in Europe (namely, Switzerland dedicated in 1955 and England dedicated in 1958); the Pacific Islands (namely, New Zealand dedicated in 1958); and Washington, D.C. (dedicated in 1974, the first American temple East of Utah since Nauvoo in 1846). All were dedicated at a time when membership in the region alone might not have justified the effort. In the 1980s, Spencer W. Kimball directed the church to build smaller temples with similar designsBefore this time, all but the Swiss Temple were at least , and the average size of the first 20 temples was . The new temples varied in size but were generally less than . By comparison, the Nauvoo Temple, built in the 1840s, was . Some of these temples have been remodeled since the original construction to provide additional rooms, allowing temples to be built where there were fewer members. As a result, the first temples in South America (Brazil dedicated in 1978); Asia (Japan dedicated in 1980); and Mexico (Mexico City dedicated in 1983) were built and the number of temples doubled from 15 to 36. The Columbus Ohio Temple, an example of smaller temples built under Hinckley's direction Church president Gordon B. Hinckley (1910‚Äì2008) also accelerated the construction of temples through the use of an even smaller standardized base design.Hinckley announced the use of smaller standardized temples in 1997 (). The base design is about , and temples built from the design are generally between . These temples generally do not include a large laundry facility, do not provide members with the ability to rent temple clothing, nor provide a cafeteria for members (Almanac, 2000). In 1998, when there were 51 temples, Hinckley set a goal to have 100 temples in place before the end of 2000. Between the brief building period from 1998 to 2001, 38 of these standardized temples were constructed and dedicated, meeting Hinckley's goal by having 102 dedicated temples before 2000 closed. During Hinckley's service as president, the number of temples more than doubled from 47 to 124.Because the two church presidents before Hinckley (Kimball and Ezra Taft Benson) had incapacitating illnesses during the latter part of their administration, Hinckley dedicated a total of 84 temples, even though, during his presidency, 14 temples were dedicated by others: James E. Faust (7), Thomas S. Monson (6), and Boyd K. Packer (1). On October 7, 2018, Russell M. Nelson announced the intent to construct 12 more temples, putting the church's total number of temples operating, under construction, or announced above 200.

It is named after the early 20th-century painter L. S. Lowry, known for his paintings of industrial scenes in North West England. The complex opened on 28 April 2000 and was officially opened on 12 October 2000 by Queen Elizabeth II. Background To redevelop the derelict Salford docks, Salford City Council developed a regeneration plan in 1988 for the brownfield site highlighting the leisure, cultural and tourism potential of the area, and included a flagship development that would involve the creation of a performing arts centre. The initial proposals were for two theatres and an art gallery on a prominent site on Pier 8. Between 1990 and 1991 a competition was launched and architects James Stirling Michael Wilford Associates was selected. After the death of James Stirling in June 1992 Michael Wilford continued the project. The city council bid for Millennium and other British and European funds and private sector finance to progress the project. Funding was secured in 1996 and The Lowry Trust became responsible for the project which comprised The Lowry Centre, the plaza, a footbridge, a retail outlet shopping mall and Digital World Centre. The National Lottery provided over ¬£21 million of funding towards its construction. The project was completed in 2000 at a cost of ¬£106 million. The Lowry name was adopted in honour of the local artist, L. S. Lowry. In 2002, a nearby shopping centre that was also named after Lowry was opened. The complex is close to the Imperial War Museum North and the Old Trafford football stadium. It is served by the MediaCityUK stop on the Metrolink tram network. In 2010 and 2011 it was Greater Manchester's most visited tourist attraction. A sting operation by the Salford Star in 2006 attempted to demonstrate intolerance towards unaccompanied teenagers in hoodies entering the complex. Design and construction The Lowry's waterfront setting The complex was designed by Michael Wilford with structural engineer Buro Happold and constructed by Bovis Construction. Groundbreaking took place on 19 June 1997. The Lowry is built on a triangular site at the end of Pier 8 and has a triangular plan. A promenade encircling the building provides views of the Manchester Ship Canal, MediaCityUK and the Salford Quays developments. The foyer faces the public plaza, where there is a large aerofoil canopy at the entrance clad with perforated steel and illuminated from inside at night. Much of the building is clad in stainless steel and glass. The Lowry was described as \\"not quite 'Salford's Guggenheim' ... It is ultimately too small and too well behaved ... although there are obvious shared aims\\", a reference to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, which was built for similar reasons. The Lowry footbridge spanning the ship canal was designed and project managed by Parkman, with design support from Carlos Fernandez Casado. It is a lift bridge with a clear span of , which lifts vertically to provide a clearance for shipping using the canal. The bridge span is a tied arch and the towers are constructed in tubular steelwork to provide an open aspect to view the lifting counterweight and sheaves. In November 2015, the Lowry opened a new bar and restaurant, called Pier 8, after a 12-week closure on the original bar and restaurant. The new space cost ¬£3m to develop and is part of an ongoing ¬£5m investment programme to improve facilities and reduce the environmental footprint of the complex. The new features include a zinc topped curving bar with room to seat 150 people for casual dining. The bar also has a feature tree with leaves made from cotton, to commemorate Salford Quays‚Äô history at the centre of the cotton shipping industry. The new restaurant contains seven private booths, a newly designed open kitchen, and a second large room at the rear which can be opened up to accommodate more diners or private functions. Major structural changes have taken place in the building for the design, including the removal of a large staircase and the addition of an external entrance to the bar and restaurant, as well as added areas made to look like shipping containers. Gallery Side view of the entrance The complex contains m¬≤ of gallery space displaying the L. S. Lowry and other collections. The Lowry collection includes about 400 works in oil, pastel and watercolours from all periods of his career. It was collected by Salford Museum and Art Gallery from the 1930s. The Artworks Creativity Gallery, designed and implemented by architects Reich-Petch (responsible for developing the National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C.), uses multimedia to encourage visitor participation and interaction with exhibits to transform gallery space. Between October 2011 and January 2012 the gallery hosted an exhibition of about 100 works by Lowry's teacher, Pierre Adolphe Valette, including paintings of Manchester from Manchester Art Gallery and loans from private owners. An Archive Room houses material related to the artist including books, catalogues of his exhibitions and auctions, press cuttings, tapes of interviews with Lowry and others, photographs and ephemera. The archive is open by appointment. Theatre At the core of the complex are two theatres and a drama studio. The Lyric Theatre has 1,730 seats while the Quays has 466. The theatres host touring plays, comedy and musical events and Opera North. The Lyric Theatre has the largest stage in the United Kingdom outside London's West End. It played host to the 2011 Royal Variety Performance. The Daughter-in-Law by D. H. Lawrence, a play in Nottingham dialect, neither published nor performed in Lawrence's lifetime was revived at the Lyric Theatre in 2012. The Lowry was the venue for the grand final of the BBC quiz show Mastermind in 2003. The Lyric Theatre has also housed the first and only televised recording of the radio show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, which Humphrey Lyttelton chaired just 19 days before his death in April 2008. An edited version aired on BBC Four, and the full edition is available on DVD. Week 53 Festival The Lowry hosts the bi-annual Week 53 Festival , its flagship Arts festival with a multi-disciplinary programme across music, dance, theatre and performance.

Career =Theatre and radio= McDougall started acting professionally in 1936 working in various facets of the entertainment industry, including radio. He emigrated to Australia and over a long career on the stage appeared in more than 50 theatre productions. These included Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, Cat Among the Pigeons, Habeas Corpus, musicals 1776 and Promises, Promises. He played in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing for the Nimrod Theatre.Atterton, Margot. (Ed.) The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Australian Showbiz, Sunshine Books, 1984. p 143 =Television= In 1969 McDougall appeared in the ABC's adaptation of Hesba Fay Brinsmead's Pastures of the Blue Crane followed in the early 1970s by several television guest appearances. He had guest roles in the Crawford Productions police procedurals Homicide and Division 4, and a regular role in 1972 comedy series A Nice Day at the Office which ran for seven episodes. He found his widest audience through his role of amateur inventor Les Whittaker, husband to brassy barmaid Norma (Sheila Kennelly), in hit soap opera Number 96. Comedy characters Les and Norma joined the series early in its 1972‚Äì1977 run and became enormously popular. Along with most of the show's regular cast, McDougall reprised his role in the 1974 film version of the series. After a fall in ratings in 1975 Les was killed off in a dramatic revamp of the series: the famous bomb storyline. It had been decided that Les's constant crazy inventions were becoming too silly, and that his death would open up the character of Norma to new romances and other storylines. The Number 96 producers soon realised that killing Les was a mistake, and McDougall was returned to the series in late 1976 as Les's long-lost brother, the aristocratic Lord Andrew McCraddenow. The new character did not work as well as Les had, and six months later both Andrew and Norma were written out of the series during another cast revamp. After Number 96 McDougall acted in Australian television films and had guest roles in such drama series as Chopper Squad, Prisoner, A Country Practice, and sitcom Mother and Son.

Early life  Francis Crozier was born in Banbridge, County Down, Ireland. He was the eleventh of thirteen children, and the fifth son of solicitor George Crozier, who named him after his friend Francis Rawdon- Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira. Crozier attended school locally in Banbridge, with his brothers William and Thomas, and lived with his family in Avonmore House which his father had built in 1792, in the centre of Banbridge.  Naval service  At the age of 13, Crozier volunteered for the Royal Navy and joined HMS Hamadryad in June 1810. In 1812, he served on and visited Pitcairn Island in 1814, where he met the last surviving mutineers from . In 1817, he received his certificate as mate; in 1818, he served on during a trip to the Cape of Good Hope.

He was appointed to the frigate in 1831, and served off the coast of Portugal during the Liberal Wars, the country's civil war. Crozier joined Clark Ross as second-in-command of HMS Cove in 1835, to assist in the search for 12 lost British whaling ships in the Arctic. Crozier was appointed to the rank of commander in 1837. = Ross expedition = and in the Antarctic, by James Wilson Carmichael. National Maritime Museum, London. In 1839, Crozier again joined Sir James Clark Ross on the Ross expedition, as second-in-command of a four-year voyage to explore the Antarctic continent in the ships and . Crozier commanded Terror, and was appointed to the rank of captain in 1841. Erebus and Terror returned in 1843, having made the most significant penetration of the Antarctic pack ice and discovered large parts of the continent‚Äîincluding the Ross Sea and Ross Island, Mount Erebus and the Ross Ice Shelf. Crozier was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1843, in recognition of his outstanding work on magnetism. = Franklin expedition = In 1845, Crozier joined Captain Sir John Franklin as captain of the on the Franklin expedition to traverse the last unnavigated section of the Northwest Passage. After Franklin's death in June 1847, he took command of the expedition, and his fate and those of the other expedition members remained a mystery until 1859, when a note written by Crozier and James Fitzjames, captain of the Erebus, was discovered on King William Island during an expedition led by Sir Francis McClintock. Dated 25 April 1848, the note indicated that the ships‚Äîstuck in ice‚Äîhad been abandoned. Nine officers, including John Franklin, and 15 crewmen had died. Also stated was their intention, on 26 April, to set out for Back's Great Fish River on the Canadian mainland. Unverified Inuit reports collected between 1852 and 1858 indicate that Crozier and one other expedition member might have been seen in the Baker Lake area, about to the south, where, in 1948, Farley Mowat found \\"a very ancient cairn, not of normal Eskimo construction,\\" inside which were fragments of a hardwood box with dovetail joints. Note: Woodman was unable to track down the origin of these Inuit reports, and the builder and origins of the cairn found by Mowat are unknown. McClintock and later searchers found relics, graves, and human remains of the Franklin crew on Beechey Island, King William Island, and the northern coast of the Canadian mainland, but no survivors.  Ships' location  In 2014, the Victoria Strait Expedition found two items on Hat Island, in the Queen Maud Gulf, near King William Island; part of a boat-launching davit bearing the stamps of two Royal Navy broad arrows, and a wooden object, possibly a plug for a deck hawse, the iron pipe through which the ship's chain cable would descend into the chain locker below. The expedition located one of Franklin's two ships, preserved in reasonably good condition. The wreck lies at the bottom of the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island and has been confirmed to be that of the Erebus. In 2016, a well-preserved ship matching Terrors description was located in Terror Bay, off the southern coast of King William Island. The exploration of the wrecks continues.

In addition to its in Madison, Wisconsin (located about four miles from the main campus of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison), the Arboretum also manages 520 acres of remnant forests and prairies throughout Wisconsin.  History  The UW Arboretum was founded on April 26, 1932, when the University Board of Regents accepted the deeds to 6 parcels, 246 acres of land on the southwestern end of Madison's Lake Wingra, creating the \\"University of Wisconsin Forest Preserve Arboretum and Wildlife Refuge\\". The acreage at the time was mostly farmland fields and pastures. In 1933, G. William Longenecker was named Arboretum Executive Director. Longenecker Horticultural Gardens would be named after him. Aldo Leopold was named Research Director and also was the first professor of game management in the U.S. He was also the first chair of the Department of Game Management at the University of Wisconsin. Leopold and other members of the first Arboretum Committee, especially Professor Norman C. Fassett of the Botany Department, proposed a research agenda around re-establishing \\"original Wisconsin\\" landscape and plant communities, particularly those that predated European settlement, such as tallgrass prairie and oak savanna. Between 1935 and 1941, crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps provided most of the labor to accomplish this task under the supervision of Ted Sperry, an ecologist and prairie plant root specialist who had studied with Arthur G. Vestal at the University of Illinois. Such work would eventually become known as ecological restoration. Some of the first tall-grass prairie restorations in the United States took place at the Arboretum. In 2020, Curtis Pond was rehabilitated, and an invasive prairie plant was removed. In addition to its long-standing commitment to ecological restoration, the Arboretum also features traditional horticultural collections of labeled plants arranged in garden-like displays. Today the Arboretum manages the oldest restored tall grass prairie in the nation along with an extensive collection of restored ecosystems that are referred to as \\"ecological communities\\": woodlands, savannas, prairies, wetlands, springs, and the Lake Wingra shoreline.  Prairies and savannas  More than 300 species of native plants that once dominated the landscape of southern Wisconsin have been restored to the arboretum's prairies and savannas. * Curtis Prairie (60 acres) ‚Äì described as the world's oldest restored prairie; a tallgrass prairie with big bluestem grass and Indian grass. * Greene Prairie (50 acres) ‚Äì planted by prairie expert Henry Greene during the 1940s and 1950s. * Marion Dunn Prairie (4 acres) ‚Äì amelioration of a settling pond. * Marsh Connection ‚Äì transition between Curtis Prairie and wetlands. * Sinaiko Overlook Prairie (5 acres) ‚Äì mesic to dry-mesic prairie dominated by Indian grass. * Southwest Grady Oak Savanna ‚Äì southern Wisconsin fire-adapted communities. * Wingra Oak Savanna ‚Äì open-grown bur oaks, being restored by the replacement of its understory of non-native trees, shrubs, and weeds with grassland species.

Collins' partner in this match was Peter Enright, also standing in his first Test match. In the preceding season, 1971/72, a scheduled tour of Australia by South Africa was cancelled following political and moral protests against the apartheid policies of the South African government. In its place a 'World Team' visited Australia and played a series of Test standard, although never officially recognised. Collins stood in one of these matches, and witnessed Garfield Sobers score 254, an innings he later regarded as the greatest he ever saw. Collins' last Test match was between Australia and the West Indies at Melbourne on 26 December to 30 December 1975, won by Australia by 8 wickets. Collins' colleague was Robin Bailhache. At the conclusion of the match, the West Indian captain Clive Lloyd strongly criticised Collins umpiring, requesting that he be replaced for the final test.

History The first inhabitants were the Tamoio Indians. After Brazil was discovered and colonized by Portugal, the Jesuits inhabited the place. In 1759, the Marquis of Pombal expelled the Jesuits, and the farms of the region were divided up to form small farms and quintas (residences located in rural properties). One of these was the Quinta da Boa Vista. In 1810, King John VI of Portugal adopted the Quinta da Boa Vista as his official residence, the Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o. Around it mansions and streets were built and electric light was installed. The local aristocracy moved to the neighborhood. During the 19th century, several meters of land were reclaimed from the sea, and the swamps were drained. Pedro II of Brazil, who was the country's second emperor, was born and bred in the neighborhood and from there he ruled the country for almost half a century. During his reign the neighborhood was modernized and industries were installed. He was deposed by a military coup on November 15, 1889 and the Quinta da Boa Vista became a museum in 1893. Since before the transposition of the Portuguese Court to the neighbourhood, the place attracted a growing Portuguese diaspora. Since then, the neighbourhood is home to a significant number of Portuguese heritage families. The neighbourhood is widely known for being the host of a significant Portuguese diasporic community, especially alongside the zones of Rua S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, Euclides da Cunha, and Fonseca Telles. Today, several second and third generation children born in the Portuguese diaspora of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o are known to have emigrated back to Europe, after acquiring Portuguese citizenship via their parents or grandparents. In 1940, the Avenida Brasil, the most important road to transport the neighborhood's production, was inaugurated. Especially during the 1950s and the 1960s, the industrialization of the area attracted migrants from several different regions of Brazil, particularly from the Northeast. Sports S√£o Crist√≥v√£o is the home of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o de Futebol e Regatas, which is a traditional Rio de Janeiro football (soccer) club. The club's stadium, Est√°dio Figueira de Melo, commonly known by its nickname Figueirinha, is also located in the neighborhood. Cultural attractions The neighbourhood has several historical buildings, of which some are historical museums like the Museu do Primeiro Reinado and the Museu Militar Conde de Linhares. The former National Museum, its former library and the zoological garden of Rio de Janeiro are located in the Quinta da Boa Vista park. There are four churches in the neighborhood, Church of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o (Igreja de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o), Church of Saint Edwigs (Igreja de Santa Edwiges), Church of Saint Roque (Igreja de S√£o Roque), and the Church of Saint Januarius and Saint Augustine (Igreja de S√£o Janu√°rio e S√£o Augustinho). The S√£o Crist√≥v√£o's Fair (Feira de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o) is another popular attraction. It is always carried out on Sundays, by the Northeast Region community.

They used letters to categorize the architecture, e.g., \\"F\\" for areas of the frontal lobe.  The Nissl staining technique  The Nissl staining technique (named for Franz Nissl the neuroscientist and histologist who originated the technique) is commonly used for determining the cytoarchitectonics of neuroanatomical structures, using common agents such as thionin, cresyl violet, or neutral red. These dyes intensely stain \\"Nissl bodies\\" (rough endoplasmic reticulum), which are abundant in neurons and reveal specific patterns of cytoarchitecture in the brain. Other common staining techniques used by histologists in other tissues (such as the hematoxylin and eosin or \\"H&E; stain\\") leave brain tissue appearing largely homogeneous and do not reveal the level of organization apparent in a Nissl stain. Nissl staining reveals details ranging from the macroscopic, such as the laminar pattern of the cerebral cortex or the interlocking nuclear patterns of the diencephalon and brainstem, to the microscopic, such as the distinctions between individual neurons and glia in any subregion of the central nervous system. Many other neuroanatomic and cytoarchitectonic techniques are available to supplement Nissl cytoarchitectonics, including immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, which allow one to label any gene or protein expressed in any group of cells in the brain. However, Nissl cytoarchitecture remains a reliable, inexpensive, and familiar starting or reference point for neuroscientists wishing to examine or communicate their findings in a widely recognized anatomical framework and/or in reference to neuroanatomical atlases which use the same technique.

In 1893, NHC moved to Durham, where it became the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in 1923, by an act of the New Hampshire General Court. History Culver Hall in Hanover, New Hampshire, was the first building of the college. (Constructed 1871‚Äì72, demolished 1929.) The Morrill Act of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. The state incorporated New Hampshire College in 1866 and opened the college in 1868 in Hanover. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident Benjamin Thompson left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891, Governor Hiram A. Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Tuttle signed a bill authorizing the college's move to Durham. Excited about the pending move to Durham, the Class of 1892 held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to \\"authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham.\\" In fall of 1893, classes began in Durham with 51 freshmen and 13 upperclassmen, and graduate study was established. In 1923, Governor Fred H. Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to University of New Hampshire, despite pressure by state agriculture interests that had defeated a similar proposal in 1911. The university was incorporated on July 1, 1923.

He made his first appearance in the series sixteen episode \\"Denial\\", broadcast on 8 June 2002. He ran Holby City Hospital's emergency department for five years, before being elected as a Member of Parliament. His final appearance was in the series twenty-two episode \\"Thicker Than Water\\", broadcast on 8 March 2008. MacCorkindale was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2006, and departed from Casualty after the disease spread to his lungs. He died on 14 October 2010, at the age of 58. Storylines Harry begins working at Holby City Hospital in June 2002. He is pleased when his old flame Selena Donovan (Liz Carling) arrives to carry out a drugs trial in the department, and invites her to dinner. He cancels a driving lesson with his teenage daughter Tally (Ashlie Walker), who asks her mother Beth (Lynda Rooke) to take her instead. They crash, and Beth is fatally injured. Harry blames Tally for the accident and develops an anti-depressant dependency, forging senior house officer Lara Stone's (Christine Stephen-Daly) signature to prescribe himself drugs. Harry clashes with registrar Simon Kaminski (Christopher Colquhoun) over his temperament, suspending him from work. In revenge, Simon begins sleeping with Tally (Holly Davidson). He learns that Harry has been self-prescribing and attempts to blackmail him. Lara notices the strained atmosphere between them, and Harry confides in her that he needs help, accepting her support. He misinterprets Lara's kindness, however, and tells her he is in love with her. His feelings go un- reciprocated, and Harry is angry when Lara sleeps with paramedic Luke Warren. On an outdoor pursuit day for management training, Harry leaves the marked route and becomes trapped in a cave. Simon rescues him, incurring a spinal injury in the process. Several weeks later, Harry discovers that Lara has begun a relationship with Simon. Tally takes the news badly and behaves erratically, leaving Harry no choice but to suspend her on the anniversary of Beth's death. When Simon mocks her, Tally attempts suicide by taking an overdose. She recovers, but Harry realises he has been neglecting her and takes her on holiday. Lara and Simon become engaged, but Harry discovers he has been cheating on her, taking Lara away from the venue on her wedding day. Simon dies in a plane crash en route to the wedding, and Lara disappoints Harry by moving to Australia. Selena returns to the department in 2004, having married since her last meeting with Harry. When she is stabbed in the hospital car park, Harry realises he still has feelings for her, but Selena cuts him off as he tries to tell her. Harry begins a relationship with nurse Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova), who becomes pregnant. Harry proposes, believing it is the right thing to do, but Ellen turns him down. It transpires that Ellen had a cancerous molar pregnancy. She is later hit by a motorbike and dies, leaving Harry distraught. He decides to go into politics when the department is threatened with closure, winning the local by-election. Following his last shift at the hospital, Harry and Selena sleep together. Jealous corporate director Nathan Spencer (Ben Price) deletes text messages Harry sends to Selena, leading her to believe their night together was a mistake. After several months in Westminster, Harry returns to the department having arranged for the Secretary of State for Health to visit. Harry and Selena are held at gunpoint by a patient's wife, and Selena declares her love for Harry before taking a bullet for him and dying. Following a bomb scare in the hospital, junior doctor Guppy convinces Harry to return, taking a job as consultant manager. When F2 doctor Ruth Winters (Georgia Taylor) attempts suicide, Harry makes her diary‚Äîreflecting how the NHS has failed her‚Äîpublic, and is forced to resign. Development MacCorkindale joined the cast of Casualty in February 2002. Following his casting, he told the Daily Record that he was a long- standing fan of the series, commenting that it was \\"great to be joining an established show with a great bunch of people.\\" Neil Bonner of the Liverpool Daily Post conflictingly quoted MacCorkindale as stating that he had never seen an episode of the show in its sixteen-year history. He was surprised to be offered the role of Harry, having spent years beforehand working in the United States, but found its Bristol location ideal having recently moved to the West Country. Compiling a \\"medical dream team\\" from multiple television hospital dramas, The Guardian Grace Dent assessed Harry's characterization as being \\"Alpha male\\", writing that he \\"comes from a long line of TV medics who stride through the hospital wards like demi-gods, saving lives, sorting out lesser medics' muck-ups and, more importantly, wooing the knickers off any passing nurse.\\" Dent deemed Harry unflappable professionally and a gentleman in his personal life, with old-fashioned principles with regards to women. In 2006, MacCorkindale experienced stomach cramps whilst filming Casualty and was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He had a section of his colon removed, and despite recommendation from doctors that he allow ten to twelve weeks for recovery, MacCorkindale scheduled the operation to coincide with a two-week break in Casualty filming schedule. He took a sixth-month sabbatical from the show, during which time he toured with a theatrical production of Agatha Christie's The Unexpected Guest. In May 2007, MacCorkindale learned that the cancer had spread to his lungs, and was told he had five years to live. He returned to film his final series of Casualty in late 2007. He did not disclose his illness to his colleagues, and found it surreal when scripts required Harry to inform patients that they had cancer or an incurable disease. MacCorkindale departed from Casualty at the end of 2007, having appeared in 229 episodes. He died on 14 October 2010, aged 58. John Yorke, Controller of BBC Drama, praised the actor, stating: \\"As the star and male lead of Casualty for over six years we owe Simon a massive debt. Not only was he a fabulously iconic consultant, he was also an inspirational team leader. One of the reasons so many people have loved working with him on Casualty is because of the tone he established on the shop floor‚Äîalways welcoming, always disciplined, always quietly the leader.\\" Reception Reviewing the 2002 episode in which Harry attends to a fairground disaster, The Guardian Rupert Smith deemed MacCorkindale \\"fantastically wooden\\". He described the plot as \\"ridiculous\\", highlighting the convenience of Harry happening to be present when the incident occurred. The following year, Smith again highlighted credibility issues with a plot which revealed Harry to be a friend of photographer Patrick Lichfield, writing that the revelation was \\"one of the most throwaway bits of exposition ever seen in British television drama.\\" Fellow Guardian critics Sarah Dempster and Jim Shelley have both commented on MacCorkindale's \\"loud\\" delivery of his lines, with Shelley deeming Harry a \\"human Foghorn Leghorn\\", and Dempster describing Casualty as being \\"Above all [...] about Simon MacCorkindale, shouting. Then panting, alarmingly, as he peers through some blinds. And then shouting again.\\" References External links * Category:Casualty (TV series) characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional politicians Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional English people Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Harry Harper (Casualty)"},{"id":"3641760","text":"The orange-bellied leafbird (Chloropsis hardwickii) is a bird native to the central and eastern Himalayas, Yunnan and northern parts of Southeast Asia.

He is a 5-time Ironman Pro winner, 4-time Arnold Classic winner, and has won the France Grand Prix, South Beach Pro Invitational, Night of Champions, and Hungarian Grand Prix. While Wheeler had the reputation of being arrogant and overconfident, he attributed this to a need to compensate for his introversion and insecurity as a child and young man.Bodybuilding.com - Pro Bodybuilding Worldwide Radio In 1994, he was involved in a near-fatal car accident that could have left him with lifelong paralysis. Falling back into depression again, he started training from scratch, returning with remarkable speed to bodybuilding's top tier.

History Fourviere is the site of the original Roman settlement of Lugdunum (43 BC). On the south side of Fourvi√®re are the vast ruins of Roman Baths, partially intact ruins of a Roman Theatre (15 BC) and a 2nd Century Roman Od√©on rediscovered in the 20th century and now home to a museum as well as a series of concerts and operas throughout the summer. Description The Tour M√©tallique de Fourvi√®re. Fourviere supports the world's two oldest and active funicular railway lines, and is known for the Catholic Basilica of Fourvi√®re. The inauguration of the golden statue of the Virgin Mary on the north-west tower is the origin of the famous 8 December Festival of Lights, when the citizens of Lyon display candles (lumignons) at their windows. This festival now attracts hundreds of thousands of people into the streets of Lyon every year. Fourvi√®re contains many religious buildings including convents, monasteries and chapels. It is known in Lyon as \\"the hill that prays\\". Fourviere is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site designated for the city of Lyon in 1998.http://www.lyon.fr/vdl/sections/en/tourisme/fil_quartier/fourviere Official site of Lyon =La Tour M√©tallique= Fourvi√®re hill is home to the La Tour M√©tallique, one of Lyon's most easily recognizable landmarks, which was privately built by the land-owners to rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It forms the highest point in Lyon and is in fact higher than the Eiffel Tower at its summit, due to it being on a hill. It is now a television relay tower. =Funicular railway= funicular of Lyon entering Saint Jean station. Fourviere supports the world's two oldest and active funicular railway lines. The Funiculars of Lyon ('Funiculaires de Lyon') is a network of funicular railways. Of the five lines once in existence, only the two routes on the Fourvi√®re hill remain in operation, with the rest of the network now either closed, converted to road vehicle use, or integrated within the Lyon underground system. Modern infrastructure A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi√®re, connecting the A6 autoroute (coming from Paris) and the A7 autoroute (coming from Marseille), both forming the \\"Autoroute du Soleil\\". Prior to the construction of the bypass of Lyon by the east, and with Lyon being virtually the only low passage between the Alps and the Massif Central (extinct) volcano range, the tunnel was famous for its traffic jams caused by a combination of local traffic, that of neighboring countries, as well as traffic between northern and southern France. =Threats to survival= The hill is very fragile in places due to springs, underground streams, ancient tunnels and aqueducts, which have caused several subsidences in the past.

Gameplay Joe fights a Tyrannosaurus in the game's first level using the stone wheel. The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue- haired Mac, cavemen who battle through numerous prehistoric levels using weapons such as boomerangs, bones, fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs.

A two-player mode is available, and in some versions both characters are capable of damaging each other. The original arcade version and Amiga, Mega Drive/Genesis, MS-DOS and Zeebo ports have the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes at the end of boss battles. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits ‚Äì each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence. Ports The game has been ported to various systems, some of which drop the name Caveman Ninja, referring to the game simply as Joe & Mac. A Super NES version was developed and published in 1991 by Data East.\\"Joe & Mac (SNES) Overview\\". AllGame. Archived November 14, 2014. In December 1992, a version for the NES was released.

Finally, in late 1993, another version was developed by Eden Entertainment Software and published by Takara for the Sega Genesis and TecToy for the Brazilian Mega Drive in early 1994. The Mega Drive/Genesis version is considered a close match to the arcade version. The Super NES version is a reworked game which features an overworld map used to choose the levels (unlike in other versions where all of them have to be played), which were longer, plus some bonus stages (either in the levels or out in the world map). Some of the weapons are missing and can no longer be charged up. The final boss is also different, and there are only two endings. The NES and Game Boy versions lack the option of choosing levels or endings. Both feature variants of the arcade boss. The Japanese version of the game includes a beginning scene in which cavemen enter a hut and emerge while dragging cavewomen by their hair. The scene was removed from the US release, with Data East stating, \\"We didn't want kids to see [the Japanese display] and think it was okay.\\" Reception The One reviewed the arcade version of Caveman Ninja in 1991, calling it \\"A cutesie 'jumpy-jumpy' game which uses some good graphics and neat comic touches to overcome the unoriginal gameplay\\", recommending it as being \\"worth a try\\". Skyler Miller of AllGame criticized the NES version for its \\"unresponsive controls,\\" writing that, \\"Jumping and simultaneously throwing your weapon, an important move, is often hard to perform.\\" Miller also wrote, \\"Although the graphics are above average for the NES, they vary from level to level.\\"\\"Joe & Mac (NES) Review\\". Skyler Miller. AllGame. Archived November 16, 2014. GamePro wrote that the NES version was colorful but that the graphics \\"are prehistoric,\\" criticizing the \\"flat backgrounds and sprites\\". GamePro also criticized the music, described as \\"rock-splitting clinks and clanks.\\" Super Play praised the SNES version for its colorful graphics, but also wrote, \\"The snag is that there isn't a lot to hold your interest. [...] the appeal starts to flag after a few minutes. The collision detection is annoying as well, tending to give baddies the benefit of the doubt in any clash of heads. I'm afraid this, coupled with the awkward controls, soon saw me adopting a 'couldn't care less' attitude towards the game.\\"\\"Joe and Mac (SNES) review\\". Super Play (November 1992). Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame praised the Genesis version's graphics and sound effects, and wrote, \\"This game features some of the best music ever on a 16-bit system.\\" Weiss criticized the game's two-player mode, writing, \\"With two players, you might help each other out of a jam from time to time, but you also slow each other down.\\"\\"Joe & Mac (Genesis) review\\". Brett Alan Weiss, AllGame. Sega Visions praised the Genesis version's \\"bright colors and bouncy sounds,\\" but criticized its controls. GamePro, reviewing the Genesis version, noted similarities to the SNES version and praised the \\"entertaining\\" two-player mode. However, the magazine concluded, \\"It's fun, but this style of game is gradually going the way of the dinosaur.\\" British television program Bad Influence! gave the SNES version 4 out of 5. Tony Dillon of CU Amiga wrote that the game \\"is a lot of fun to play. Not as complete or polished as Zool, but still a great platform game. Controls are responsive, the graphics are good and the sampled sound is excellent, but I couldn't help feeling that in these times of epic Amiga games, this one is just a little too limited.\\" Huw Melliar-Smith of Amiga Action wrote that the animation of the game's enemies \\"is pretty good. Not spectacular, but good nonetheless. As Joe & Mac are the focus of attention, perhaps a little more effort might have gone into their creation.\\" Melliar-Smith praised the multiplayer option as being superior to single-player mode, and also complimented the sound effects, but called the music \\"repetitive and not particularly creative.\\" Melliar-Smith also criticized the unresponsive controls, writing, \\"It is the gameplay that is most disappointing.\\" Dave Paget of Amiga Format praised its \\"clear graphics and well-drawn backdrops,\\" but wrote that the game \\"is a bit shallow, your cavemen amble along and the levels are linear and allow no exploration.\\" David Upchurch of The One Amiga called the plot and gameplay \\"uninspired.\\" Upchurch also wrote, \\"The colour palettes are garish, and it's often hard to pick out the sprites from the backgrounds. Worse still, everything's so sluggish - the so-called Ninjas amble around like they've been drugged and getting them to do anything quickly (pretty essential for a game like this) is near-impossible. Difficulty-wise, it's paradoxically very hard and very easy.\\" Upchurch criticized the unresponsive controls, but praised the sound. Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power criticized the game for using \\"the kind of options screen that you'd have to be a professional semaphore operator to penetrate. I had to spend almost five minutes reading the manual just to work out how to select which of the two pointlessly-complicated joystick modes I wanted to use [...] and I still haven't quite got to grips with how to toggle the music and sound effects.\\" Campbell also criticized the game for \\"some of the cheap 'n' nastiest-looking graphics seen on the Amiga in recent memory.\\" Campbell criticized the game's poor control system and its \\"fairly short and tedious\\" levels, and concluded that the game was \\"a lump of crap.\\" Total! gave the Game Boy version 75%, praising the graphics, but criticizing the collision detection. The magazine also criticized the backgrounds, which caused the main character of Joe to blend into the environment, creating confusion regarding his location. Nintendo Power positively wrote about the Game Boy version, \\"Good graphics and animation rival those of the NES and Super NES versions,\\" but negatively wrote, \\"Background blur while walking is severe, making it difficult to see approaching enemies.\\" Legacy The game was followed by various sequels. The Japanese version of the SNES game Congo's Caper was presented as a sequel called Tatakae Genshijin 2: Rookie no B≈çken and featured a new protagonist. The title duo would later return in Joe & Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics, which added light role-playing aspects to the series. An arcade sequel titled Joe & Mac Returns eschewed the scrolling action of the original games in favor of gameplay similar to another Data East series, Tumblepop. Joe and Mac appear in a German Mario comic, titled Super Mario: Verloren in der Zeit. An updated version of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the Intellivision Amico. =Possible reboot= In November 2009, Golgoth Studio announced plans to reboot the Joe & Mac series, following their completion of a Toki remake.\\"Golgoth to resurrect 'Joe & Mac' series\\" Mark Langshaw, www.DigitalSpy.com (November 7, 2009).

This was the first American prosecution for a crime which took place in two different jurisdictions, as Botkin had sent the poison from California, but it was received in Delaware. Background Botkin was born in Missouri, and later moved with her family to California, where she married her husband, Welcome Botkin. They were the parents of one son. In 1895, Botkin met John Preston Dunning while he was bicycling in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Although she was then 41, nine years his senior, and both of them were married, Dunning was smitten with her. Dunning was a highly regarded reporter for the Associated Press, having completed overseas assignments in Samoa and Chile. He had been promoted to superintendent of the Associated Press's Western Division bureau in San Francisco. In 1896, Dunning's wife, Mary Elizabeth (Penington) Dunning, upset by her husband's marital indiscretions, left him and returned with their daughter to Dover, Delaware, to the home of her father, former Congressman John B. Penington. By then Botkin had become Dunning's lover and constant companion. Botkin was estranged from her own husband, a grain broker in Stockton, California, but he supported her with regular remittances. Dunning, a heavy drinker, was fired by the Associated Press when it was discovered he had embezzled $4,000 in office funds to pay his gambling debts. He was next let go by newspapers in Salt Lake City and San Francisco because of his habitual drunkenness, and moved into Botkin's hotel. The affair lasted almost three years, but ended when Dunning was re-hired in March 1898 as the agency's lead reporter for what would become the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. When he left San Francisco, he told the weeping Botkin that he would not return. He reconciled with his wife before leaving for Cuba, where he helped save survivors of the Spanish battleships that were sunk at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 2, 1898. Murders Cordelia Botkin sent anonymous letters to Elizabeth Dunning detailing her husband's affairs. On August 9, 1898, Elizabeth opened a box of candies addressed to her and her sister in Dover, Delaware. It was only \\"With love to yourself and baby.\\" \\"Passionately fond of candy,\\" according to her husband, Dunning took at least three pieces herself and shared the rest with others on the porch of her father's home. After two days in agony, Elizabeth and her older sister, 44-year-old Ida Harriet Deane, died from arsenic poisoning. Four others who had sampled the chocolates survived. Elizabeth's father remarked upon the familiar handwriting on the note and saw that it matched the taunting letters he had kept in a drawer. Police traced the candy to a shop in San Francisco, and from there, to Botkin. Trial Botkin was tried before Judge Carroll Cook. District Attorney, Lewis Francis Byington prosecuted Cordelia Botkin in the murder trial on April 30, 1904. She was convicted of murder in December 1898, appealed, and was convicted again at a retrial in 1904. She was sentenced to life imprisonment. She was initially imprisoned in San Francisco, but after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, was transferred to San Quentin State Prison, where she died in 1910;MRS BOTKIN, POISONER, DEAD; Expires at San Quentin, Where She Was Serving Life Term, in the Washington Post; published March 9, 1910; archived online at genealogy.com; retrieved January 16, 2017 John Dunning, his career destroyed by the revelations during the trial, had died two years earlier in Philadelphia.

Original men's entrance at left, women's at right. Division Street Russian and Turkish Baths / Red Square is a traditional Russian-style bathhouse at 1914 W. Division Street in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, which closed in 2010 and reopened in 2011 under the name Red Square, offering separate facilities for both men and women, with some mixed gender areas as well. It has operated since 1906. In 2011, the bath was purchased and a full renovation and modernization was completed. The bathhouse was opened under the name Red Square, which continues to operate as of January 2017. The most popular feature at Division Bath is the traditional Russian Banya or hot room. These rooms (one on either side) were built of concrete and tile with glass doors. In a corner of each is a brick oven in which granite boulders, approximately the size of watermelons, are heated to extreme temperatures by gas jets; hot water is then thrown on the rocks by the customers as desired. When this happens, the water instantly evaporates, creating steam inside the oven and heating the brick enclosure, thereby raising the air temperature in the room. This method provides a much dryer heat than common steam rooms. The bathers would sit or lie on three- level tiered wooden benches, which allow for dramatically different temperatures at the various heights. Cold water is provided by taps located under the benches - when overwhelmed by the heat, a bather will dump a bucket of frigid water over their head while still in the hot room, or may step outside to use the cold pools. Division Bath is the only traditional bathhouse remaining in Chicago, and one of only a handful in the United States. Authors who have written about it include Nelson Algren and Saul Bellow. One of its most prominent regular customers was Reverend Jesse Jackson - a fact that brought the bathhouse some publicity when it was first reported in the mainstream press. Mobster Sam Giancana was also said to have gone, and various out-of-town celebrities such as James Gandolfini and Russell Crowe had occasionally visited; their autographed portraits lined a corridor on the first floor.

Constantina received the title of Augusta by her father, and is venerated as a saint, having developed a medieval legend wildly at variance with what is known of her actual character. Life Mausoleo di Santa Costanza, part of the complex of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in Rome, it is now on display at the Museo Pio- Clementino in the Vatican City. In 335, Constantina married her cousin Hannibalianus, son of Flavius Dalmatius, whom Constantine had created \\"King of Kings and Ruler of the Pontic Tribes\\". After Emperor Constantine the Great died, great purges of the imperial family occurred and her husband was executed in 337.Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv 1.2. For the second time, Constantius II gave Constantina to Hannibalianus' cousin, and her own half cousin Gallus. Gallus was created a Caesar of the East and his name changed to Constantius Gallus to further his legitimacy around 349/350, which also presumably was the time of their marriage. Gallus was twenty-five or twenty- six at the time, whereas Constantina was substantially his senior. Her second marriage produced a daughter Anastasia, whose full name and fate are unknown.Flavius Claudius Iulianus, Epistola ad Athenienses, 272 D. Constantina and Constantius Gallus were then sent from Rome to Syria at Antioch to govern that portion of the Eastern Roman Empire. She would not return to Rome until her death. In 354 AD, when Constantius called for Gallus, the caesar sent Constantina to her brother, with the purpose to mitigate his position in Constantius' consideration. While on her way to meet with Constantius II, she died at Caeni Gallicani in Bithynia (Asia Minor). The cause of her death was a sudden high fever of unknown cause. Her body was sent back to Rome and entombed near Via Nomentana in a mausoleum her father, Emperor Constantine I, had started building for her. This mausoleum would later become known as the church of Santa Costanza, when Constantina was venerated as saint. Her magnificent porphyry sarcophagus is on exhibit in the Vatican Museums. Political power and influence Upon marrying Hannibalianus her father made her Augusta but it was mostly an honorary title. After her husband was executed in 337 AD, Constantina disappeared from the imperial record until 350 AD. This is when Magnentius revolted against her brother Constantius II which caused great political upheaval. This prompted her to become directly involved in the political revolt. She exercised her political power by asking Vetranio to challenge Magnentius, thereby hoping to protect her own political interests and preserve her power. Not only did Constantina exercise political power on her own, she was inherently, as a female member of the imperial Roman family, a political tool. As a widow, she could be offered in marriage to secure political alliance. This happened twice. In 350 AD, in order to attempt a peaceful compromise by arraigning marriage, Magnentius offered to marry Constantina and have Constantius II marry his daughter. But Constantius II refused this offer. Shortly after, in 351 AD, Constantius II used Constantina for a different political purpose and gave her in marriage to Constantius Gallus who was made Caesar in the Eastern Roman Empire and they moved to Antioch. The Passio Artemii (12) alleges that the marriage was meant to ensure Gallus' loyalty but it may have had at least as much to do with Constantina who, besides having known power as Constantine's daughter and Hannibalianus' wife, had prompted the opposition of Vetranio to Magnentius, and whose hand had been sought from Constantius by ambassadors of Magnentius himself. The marriage, besides benefiting Constantius, extricated her from a dangerous situation in the Roman Empire and placed her in a position from which she might control the younger and inexperienced Caesar. On the other hand, it is possible that Constantius saw the marriage as a way to remove his intrusive ‚Äî perhaps treasonous ‚Äî sister from the volatile west. If the mention in the Passio Artemii (11) of letters from Constantina to her brother preserves a genuine tradition, it is possible Constantina even initiated the proposal that she marry Gallus. Gallus ruled over the East from Antioch, and his purpose was to keep under control the Sassanid menace. Gallus, however, alienated the support of his subjects with his arbitrary and merciless rule. Constantina supported her husband. It is in Antioch that Constantina appeared to become politically active in the way typical of imperial Roman women. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, she was sinister and cruel, who largely operated hidden from the public view but was still powerfully controlling. He suggests that she called for the murder of several people, \\"Gallus...had just enough strength to reply that most of them had been massacred at the insistence of his wife Constantina\\". While this can not be proven, it does give her character the perception of being cruel and violent. When, after receiving the complaints of the Anthiocheans, Constantius II summoned both Gallus and Constantina, but according to Ammianus Constantina tried to go to him first alone in the hope that their familiar ties would help ease tensions, \\"she set out in the hope that as he was her brother she would be able to soften him\\". In her last attempt at using her political power, Constantina went to try to meet with her brother the Emperor to try to pacify him in his conflict with her husband Constantius Gallus. Character assessment Santa Maria della Scala in Siena. Edward Gibbon likened Constantina to one of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of human blood. The historian said that she encouraged the violent nature of Gallus rather than persuading him to show reason and compassion. Gibbon stated that her vanity was accentuated while the gentle qualities of a woman were absent in her makeup. She would have accepted a pearl necklace in return for consenting to the execution of a worthy nobleman. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Constantina appeared to be extremely cruel and violent. He portrayed her as full of pride and disturbingly violent, \\"her pride was swollen beyond measure; she was a Fury in mortal form, incessantly adding fuel to her husband's rage, and as thirsty for human blood as he\\". Medieval legend In the Middle Ages, Constantina developed a legend, connected with the life of Agnes of Rome; the origins of this are unclear, though she was certainly buried in a mausoleum, Santa Costanza, attached to the large Constantinian basilica over the catacomb where Agnes is buried. The mausoleum survives largely intact, but now only parts of the wall of the basilica survive. In the version told by the Golden Legend, she caught leprosy, and was then miraculously cured when praying at Agnes' tomb, which is supposed to be at the site of the later Basilica of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura alongside the earlier basilica. (The Ethiopian Synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to Abu Mena to be cured, and credits her with finding Menas' body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site.)Grossmann, Peter (1998). \\"The Pilgrimage Center of Ab√ª M√Æn√¢\\". in D. Frankfurter (ed.), Pilgrimage & Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt. Leiden-Boston-K√∂ln, Brill: p. 282 Constantina took a vow of chastity, and converted her fianc√© Gallicanus, and eventually left her wealth to her servants John and Paul for them to spend on Christian works. The story, with considerable elaborations, survives in various literary forms, and as a figure from the life of Agnes, Constantina appears in the late 14th enamelled scenes on the Royal Gold Cup in the British Museum. Cult and recognition of her holiness Her relics were placed by Pope Alexander IV under a new altar. Today, the grave of Constantina is in the church of Santa Costanza, Rome. It was only in the 16th century that Constantina, Attica, and Artemia were placed for the first time in martyrologies. The feast day of Constantina is 18 February. Attica and Artemia are venerated, in addition, on 28 January and 17 February. Together, they are venerated on 25 February and 25 June.

Swann is an American lawyer and retired career Army colonel. He was the second Chief Prosecutor of the Military Commission at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, serving 2004 to 2006. He followed Fred Borch, who resigned in disgrace, and William Lietzau, acting Chief Prosecutor. After active duty officer Morris Davis became Chief Prosecutor, Swann remained on the prosecution team. In 2008 he was the lead prosecutor for the Department of Defense in military commission cases of Khalid Sheik Muhammed and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. These were put on hold pending 2009 amendments to the Military Commissions Act. The charges were dropped in 2009 when the administration intended to transfer the cases to federal court. Swann intended to try to be appointed to prosecute when the cases were transferred to the civilian justice system. Following the refusal of Congress to go along with a federal trial in New York, the government in 2012 began prosecution of military commissions again. Guantanamo military commissions Swann was appointed as the second Chief Prosecutor of the Guantanamo military commissions, replacing Fred Borch in 2004. =Internal criticisms of Borch= Australian newspapers broke the story in the summer of 2005, that three military lawyers on the prosecution team had criticised Borch's conduct of the prosecution, saying that he was not ensuring due process to defendants. The three prosecutors whose memos were leaked were: Robert Preston, John Carr, and Carrie Wolf. Their memos, written in 2003, were leaked in 2005. Those memos stated: *That Borch had assured the prosecution team that the officers sitting in judgment on the commission would be handpicked to be sure to convict, so prosecutors didn't have to worry about doing a good job. *That Borch had assured the prosecution team that any exculpatory evidence in favor of the suspects would be classified, so it wouldn't be made available to the suspect, or his defense team. Preston, Carr and Wolf were all reassigned, as they requested. All three were subsequently promoted. After the memos were written, the Department of Defense investigated, and said the allegations were unfounded. Although Borch denied their allegations, he resigned his commission in April 2004. The Department of Defense revised the structure of the Military commission, changes which Swann supported the revisions. In addition, Swann and the new Presiding Officer recommended removal of two other original Commission panel members. After the memos were leaked in 2005, there was renewed attention to the military commission, but Defense stated that it had already made substantive changes and replaced the top personnel. Prosecutor complaints about Swann On March 31, 2007 the Wall Street Journal published a long article about Stuart Couch, a military prosecutor who had worked under Swann. According to the Wall Street Journal, Couch considered requesting reassignment from the prosecution team, but ultimately requested reassignment from the prosecution of Mohamedou Ould Slahi. While Couch believed that Slahi was guilty, he had come to believe that the confessions and other evidence against Slahi were too tainted by having been obtained by abusive interrogation techniques for them to be admissible as evidence in court. Couch thought that the interrogation techniques had violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the United States' own laws, and International treaties to which the United States was a signatory. Couch and Swann reportedly had a loud and acrimonious confrontation over his decision. The WSG reported that when Swann learned of Couch's moral reservations, he demanded: > What makes you think you're so much better than the rest of us around here?\\" > Further, \\"An impassioned debate followed, the prosecutor recalls. Col. Swann > said the Torture Convention didn't apply to military commissions. Col. Couch > asked his superior to cite legal precedent that would allow the president to > disregard a treaty. In 2008 Swann was appointed as the lead prosecutor in what were to be military commission trials of Sheikh Khalid Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi.

The album was recorded with the Shocking Pinks (a band made up just for the occasion), and features a selection of rockabilly songs (both covers and original material). Running 25 minutes, it is Young's shortest album. Everybody's Rockin' is typical of his 1980s period in that it bears little or no resemblance to the album released before it (Trans (1982), a synth-heavy, electro-rock album), nor the one released after it (Old Ways (1985), which is pure country). Background Having already created tension with his label, Geffen Records, with the previous year's Trans, in 1983 Young offered the label a country album he'd recorded the previous fall called Old Ways.Clancy, Chris. \\"From the Vault: Neil Young.\\" Money, September 2, 2010. Young's music had previously shown the influence of country music, including his most successful album, Harvest (1972). Geffen, however, reeling from the commercial and critical failure of Trans, rejected Old Ways and demanded \\"a rock & roll album.\\" Young went into the studio and quickly produced an album with a sound reminiscent of the early period of rock & roll, including Jimmy Reed's \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" and \\"Mystery Train,\\" recorded by Elvis Presley in his early days at Sun Records. The production included '50s-style vocal reverb and backing choruses. Most songs were Young originals, such as \\"Kinda Fonda Wanda\\" that had originally been written to amuse his wife. Young wrote the song \\"Wonderin'\\" long before the sessions for Everybody's Rockin. It dates from at least the After the Gold Rush era, and was part of his setlist at solo acoustic shows in 1970. \\"Wonderin'\\" and \\"Cry, Cry, Cry\\" were released as singles and both featured accompanying music videos, but MTV gave them little airtime. Like with Trans, Young conducted a supporting tour for Everybody's Rockin and played material from the album live despite the poor reception and low attendance at his concerts. According to Young, Everybody's Rockin had been intended to be a concept album, with two additional songs, \\"Get Gone\\" and \\"Don't Take Your Love Away From Me,\\" that would have \\"given a lot more depth to The Shocking Pinks.\\"Kent, Nick. \\"I BUILD SOMETHING UP, I TEAR IT RIGHT DOWN: Neil Young at 50.\\" Mojo, December 1995 However, an infuriated Geffen Records cancelled the recording sessions, preventing Young from finishing the album, and released it as it was. The two songs later appeared on Young's compilation Lucky Thirteen. Young explained the inspiration for the album in 1995, saying that \\"there was very little depth to the material obviously. They were all 'surface' songs. But see, there was a time when music was like that, when all pop stars were like that. And it was good music, really good music. Plus it was a way of further destroying what I'd already set up. Without doing that, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now. If I build something up, I have to systematically tear it right down before people decide, 'Oh that's how we can define him.'\\" He also said of his rockabilly persona, \\"I was that guy for a year and a half, almost like being in a movie.\\" Reception At the time of its release, Everybody's Rockin' received among the worst critical reviews of Young's career. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice wrote that \\"The covers are redundant or worse, as are all but two of the originals....I hope Neil realizes that for all the horrible truth of \\"Payola Blues,\\" nobody's three thou's gonna get this on top forty.\\" New Musical Express added, \\"At least Neil Young has yet resisted rejoining Crosby, Stills and Nash, although this foray into rockabilly pastiche is hardly much less regressive than that.\\" Young himself expressed fondness for the album, comparing it favorably to his acclaimed 1975 album Tonight's the Night, yet also acknowledging the truth of some of its harsher criticisms: \\"What am I? Stupid? Did people really think I put that out thinking it was the greatest fuckin' thing I'd ever recorded? Obviously I'm aware it's not.\\" Everybody's Rockin' was included in Q magazine's 2006 list of the 50 worst albums ever made. Lawsuit In November 1983, following the commercial failure of Everybody's Rockin', Geffen sued Young for $3.3 million, on the grounds that this record and its predecessor were \\"not commercial\\", and \\"musically uncharacteristic of [his] previous recordings.\\" Young filed a $21 million countersuit, alleging breach of contract since Young had been promised no creative interference from the label. The suit backfired against Geffen, with label owner David Geffen personally apologizing to Young for the suit and for interference with his work. The year before the lawsuit, just after Young had signed to Geffen, his longtime manager Elliot Roberts was asked why Young had changed labels, and said, \\"I did have a much larger offer from RCA, about $4 million more. David Geffen and I used to be partners and David has worked with Neil for a very long time. He totally relates to Neil as an artist and has no preconceived notions about Neil. He knows that he's capable of doing anything at any point, at any time... He will have the freedom to practice his art as he sees it, as opposed to when you make a deal where someone is paying you $1-2 million an album you feel obligated to give them commercial music that they can sell large numbers of. Neil's not concerned with selling large numbers of his records, he's concerned with making records that he's pleased with. Unfortunately they are not always commercial from the record company's point of view. David Geffen relates to that. He knows Neil may do a country album and then he may do an electric album because there's no rhyme or reason with Neil. It's what he's moved by.\\" Track listing All songs written and composed by Neil Young, except where noted.

His first match was between Australia and Pakistan at Melbourne on 29 December 1972 to 3 January 1973, won by Australia by 92 runs with Ian Redpath, Greg Chappell, Paul Sheahan, and John Benaud all scoring centuries. Enright‚Äôs partner in this match was Jack Collins, also standing in his first Test match.

In its place a ‚ÄòWorld Team‚Äô visited Australia and played a series of Test standard, although never officially recognised. Enright stood in one of these matches, a rain-affected draw strongly in Australia‚Äôs favour. Enright‚Äôs last Test match was between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide on 26 January to 31 January 1974, a match that Australia won by an innings. Enright‚Äôs colleague was Jack Collins.

The Program is open to same-sex and opposite-sex couples. It provides some limited legal relationship recognition, in that participating couples may produce their Declaration as partial evidence of the existence of their relationship in certain circumstances. It does not confer the same legal rights as marriage. Legal considerations for potential applicants are outlined in both the information pack accompanying the application form and in Council Minutes (Item 3A, 28 July 2004). Public Repute Test The Relationships Declaration may be used as contributory evidence towards satisfying the Public Repute Test. Solicitor Gerard Gooden states that to satisfy this test, evidence needs to be submitted that shows that the de facto couple had held themselves out to be in such a relationship in public. Mr Gooden is a family law solicitor with extensive experience in law involving de facto relationships, including same sex relationships. In an combined presentation to the MAG (Mature Age Gays association) he states that the De Facto Relationships Act applies \\"eleven tests to determine the legal validity of a de facto relationship\\" and that \\"gay men, can typically only satisfy four of these eleven criteria.\\" One of these is the Public Respute test. In Lord Mayor Clover Moore's minute (Item 3A) on 28 July 2004 information provided by Mr Gooden and Mr Martin Gorrick states that this Declaration may provide \\"probative (but not conclusive) evidence of the existence of the de facto relationship\\". An excerpt from this minute states: \\"A couple who makes their declaration publicly (ie in front of family and/or friends) may provide evidence relating to \\"the reputation and public aspects of the relationship\\" (see s4 (2) (i).) Identification You can use the Relationships Declaration at banks and other financial institutions to prove your identity. It is worth 25 points which gives it the same number of points as an Australian Marriage Certificate. Financial institutions use AUSTRAC's 100 point ID system. According to this system, customers have to show various forms of ID to make up the 100 points, in order to be able to prove their identity. This means you have to present your Relationships Declaration (25 points) along with other forms of ID such as your passport or Medicare card, in order to make up the 100 points required. The National Australia Bank (NAB) have directly confirmed that they will accept the Relationship Declaration as a form of ID worth 25 points. However the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) will not accept the Relationships Declaration, even though they will accept a Marriage Certificate as ID ‚Äì same sex couples do not have access to an Australian Marriage Certificate so this creates an unequal situation. Other institutions such as the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages no longer accepts an Australian Marriage Certificate as a form of ID ‚Äì this creates an equal situation for both opposite sex and same sex couples as both are not allowed to present their relationship certificates as a form of ID. Superannuation Zurich Financial Services and the Russell Superannuation state that the Relationship Declaration can be tendered as evidence of an interdependent relationship. It will provide contributory evidence but not conclusive evidence ‚Äì that is, other evidence will still have to be submitted in order to prove the relationship existed. When a person dies, the superannuation fund has limits on who it can distribute the dead person's superannuation funds to. For example, you have to prove you are a spouse or that you are interdependent. Application for a death certificate In order to be able to gain a copy of a death certificate you must show that you are a close family member, spouse or otherwise entitled to a copy of the certificate. The Relationships Declaration will be accepted as partial evidence towards proving that your de facto relationship existed with the deceased ‚Äì and therefore will assist you in part in obtaining this document. In addition, some funeral houses refuse to recognise the existence or rights of a same-sex relationship, and will not allow the surviving same sex partner to have any say in making the funeral arrangements for their deceased partner. A Relationships Declaration may provide some official proof to the funeral house that the relationship existed. The surviving same-sex partner does have a right to have a say in funeral arrangements, and if there are any problems, these should be referred to the NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, NSW Anti-Discrimination Board, or the NSW Attorney General's Department. Understandably, due to the limited time that one has to prepare a funeral, one may not have time to receive an answer back from these bodies before the deceased partner is buried. Amendment of a death certificate The Relationships Declaration will be accepted as partial evidence towards proving that your de facto relationship existed with the deceased. At the very least, the Relationships Declaration proves that at some time in your lives you had a close personal relationship with the deceased. The Declaration does not prove that the relationship existed at the time of death ‚Äì you can produce other evidence to show this. Any de facto relationship (or marriage) that the deceased had may be listed on their death certificate (not only the one at the time of death). Immigration There is at least one case of the Relationships Declaration being used successfully at the Chinese Embassy, in the case of an opposite-sex (heterosexual) relationship ‚Äì where the partners did not have the opportunity to marry before immigration to China. The Declaration was used for the purposes of family visa application. How many have formed a registered partnership in Sydney? Since 2004, both same-sex and mixed-sex couples can register, if both are unrelated, unmarried adults living in the City of Sydney. As of today, 224 opposite-sex and 77 same-sex couples had registered; 24 opposite-sex, 1 female same-sex couples and 9 male same-sex couples unregistered. Melbourne Since 2007, Melbourne also has a relationship register, which is very similar to that of Sydney. How many have entered a registered partnership in Melbourne? Since 2007, both same-sex and opposite- sex couples can register a partnership, if both are unrelated, unwed adults living in the City of Melbourne. As of today, ninety opposite-sex and eight same-sex couples have registered; four opposite-sex have unregistered, no same-sex couples have unregistered as yet.

He was the elder brother of Meng Yi. He descended from a great line of military generals and architects. His grandfather, , was a general from the era of King Zhao; and his father, , was also a general who served as a deputy to Wang Jian. Life By the time the Qin state conquered the other six states and began its reign over a unified China in 221 BC, the nomadic Xiongnu had grown into a powerful invading force in the north and started expanding both east and west. Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, sent a 100,000-strong army headed by Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu northward for 1,000 li (about 416 km) and began work on what has become known as the Great Wall to guard against invasion. The defensive works he began were said to extend over 10,000 li (4,158 km) \\"from Lintao to Liaodong and even extended across the Yellow River and through Yangshan and Beijia.\\",Watson (1993), pp. 133, 194 that is, from the southwest corner of the Ordos Loop to the Yellow Sea. Yangshan and Beijia are hard to locate, but the wall ran along the Yellow River and included all of the Ordos Loop. Meng Tian's ingenuity can be seen in the efficient (though inhumane) building policy, the consideration of topography, and the utilisation of natural barriers. Meng Tian supervised the construction of a road system linking the former Yan, Qi, Wu and Chu areas, as well as a number of roads especially for imperial use. The system eventually formed played an extremely important role in ancient transportation and economic exchanges. He is also traditionally, if erroneously, credited with having invented the \\"Ink brush\\" (ÊØõÁ≠Ü) and is specially remembered at the \\"Huzhou Pen Festival\\", which developed from festivities at his ancestor temple. Meng Tian is also credited with inventing the zheng a type of musical instrument. When Fusu, Qin Shi Huang's eldest son and the crown prince, was exiled to work at the northern border for disputing his father's policies, Meng Tian was ordered to assist the prince ‚Äî a task he had accomplished loyally. When Qin Shi Huang died, Meng Tian's death was caused by Zhao Gao who forged a letter from Qin Shi Huang.Tung, Douglas S. Tung, Kenneth. (2003). More Than 36 Stratagems: A Systematic Classification Based On Basic Behaviours. Trafford Publishing. . He was forced to commit suicide in prison, and his family was killed. Three years after his death, the Qin dynasty collapsed. Legacy Meng Tian sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with Fusu. He is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei. He also appears as a non-playable character in Prince of Qin. In the manga series Kingdom, Meng Tian is known as Mou Ten, the eldest son of general Mou Bu (Meng Wu). He looks different than his father and younger brother. He has a feminine appearance, with shoulder length black orange hair and a pink robe over his armor. He leads his forces alongside Wang Ben/Ou Hon and Li Xin/Ri Shin, but his tactical expertise is higher and better known due to him being a graduate of Lord Changping's school. He acts as a referee or peacekeeper for Wang Ben/Ou Hon and Li Xin/Shin, who are shown to despise each other and argue constantly in the series.

The project, which cost nearly four billion dollars by 2015, developed in a remote, forested region of the Amazon Basin which has a population of mostly Indigenous people. History In July 1981 the Peruvian government signed an oil contract for blocks 38 and 42 with Royal Dutch Shell. The contract covered approximately in the southern part of the Ucayali Basin. The Camisea gas fields were discovered in 1986 by Shell. By 1987, two non- associated natural gas fields, San Mart√≠n and Cashiriari, were approved economically feasible. In March 1988, the preliminary agreement on exploration was signed between Petroper√∫ and Shell. However, the talks ended in August of that year without reaching a final agreement. Shell and Petroper√∫ signed the agreement for the assessment and development of the Camisea fields in March 1994. A consortium of Shell and Mobil started to develop the fields, but cancelled all projects in Peru in July 1998, due to political concerns. Six drilled wells and facilities went to the Peruvian State. For this reason, in May 1999, the Commission for the Promotion of Private Investment agrees to conduct a promotional process to develop the Camisea project through a scheme involving independent modules segmented business. In 1999, it adopted the Law No. 27133 with an assured supply of the domestic market by a \\"permanent horizon of 20 years.\\" In late May 1999, the Special Committee of Camisea Project (CECAM) convened two international public tender for awarding the contract for the exploitation of Camisea, concessions and transport of liquids and gas from these fields to the coast and gas distribution in Lima and Callao. In December 2000, contracts were signed for the project development with an international consortium which now includes of Pluspetrol (27.2%), Hunt Oil Company (25.2%) SK Corporation (17.6%), Repsol YPF (10%), Tecpetrol (10%), and Sonatrach (10%). The key legal advisors in the transaction were Jaime Malag√≥n, Jerome Jakubik, Paul Slocomb, and V√≠ctor M. Marroqu√≠n of Baker & McKenzie, the international law firm retained by the Peruvian Government to advise on all privatization processes. In early May 2002, signed the concession contract for the transportation and distribution of gas from Camisea. In 2003 promulgating the DS 031-MS, eliminating the phrase \\"permanent horizon of 20 years\\" of Law No. 27133 and replacing it with \\"a minimum period specified in the contract.\\" In June 2005 approving the Law 28 552, which amends Law 27133, disappears the phrase \\"permanent horizon of 20 years\\" and instead supply guarantees are mentioned in general terms. This made possible to allocate 100% of the Block 56 reserves for export. Since the Block 56 was not sufficient for export commitment again make the policy changes necessary to also dispose of Lot 88, for the domestic market. In December 2005 promulgating the 2005 EM 050 DS. In the preamble to the DS was explicitly stated that having the Act amended 28552 Article 4 of Law 27133 in relation to supplying the domestic market, authorizing Perupetro to renegotiate the contract for Block 88 to allow its proven reserves are exported. The development plan was carried out under the government of President Alejandro Toledo and the gas fields became operational in August 2004. Gas fields The gas fields are located in Ucayali Basin. According to data verified by the international energy consulting firm Gaffney, Cline & Associates, the Camisea gas fields contain about of natural gas and of natural gas liquids. Pipelines Two pipelines carry natural gas from the Camisea gas fields. The Camisea pipeline traverses through the steep Andes mountains, and terminates within the Paracas National Reservation (Ica Region) at the Pisco terminal. It passes through the Malvinas plant, where liquefied petroleum gas (propane and heavier liquids) is separated from natural gas. The pipeline has capacity of . The second natural gas pipeline runs from Malvinas along the coast to Lima and Callao for distribution to residents and industries in the capital city. LPG is exported through the Pisco terminal. This pipeline system is operated by Transportadora de Gas Peruano, a consortium of Tecgas, Pluspetrol, Hunt Oil Company, SK Corporation, Sonatrach and Grana y Montero. In April 2007, Suez Energy and Kuntur Gas Transport unveiled rival proposals for pipelines to carry Camisea gas to southern Peru. Controversy Law 27133 was amended by Supreme Decree 050-2005, 006-2006 and 031-2004, both given by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. Those rules were signed by Alejandro Toledo, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Jaime Quijandria. This conduct would be unconstitutional because the President would have issued a Supreme Decree (No. 050-2005 and 006-2006) in open distortion of the law (Law 27,133), thus violating Article 118 (paragraph 8) of the Constitution, rule setting corresponding to the president, exercising the power of regulating laws without violating or distorting. For the above irregularities are accused former officials of the crimes of extortion, collusion, unfair and abuse of authority. Under Article 384 of the Criminal Code sets out the demand-MEM-which makes the proper functional performance of public officials, is to ensure that interests of the State \\", but\\" the conduct of former president and former minister (Clodomiro Sanchez) to allow modification of operation contracts for Block 88 that rule violated the Criminal Code. Under Article 376 of the Penal Code, abusive behavior is to violate the normative basis using the position that the subject (official) supports. This is arbitrary distorting an Act (27 133) through a Supreme Decree (050-2005 and 006-2006). As of March 2006 there had been five spills along the pipeline. The latest one occurred on 4 March 2006, resulting in three injuries.El Comercio, Piden auditor√≠a internacional para gasoducto de Camisea. March 3, 2006. The UN has called for the \\"immediate suspension\\" of any plans to expand the Camisea Gas project, due to the high likelihood that by further intrusion into the Nahua-Nanti Reserve, several uncontacted and isolated tribes who live in the territory could be placed at risk of disease and death, as well as extreme scarcity brought on by disruption to game animals. The territory also serves as a buffer zone for Manu National Park, considered by UNESCO to be \\"the most biodiverse place on earth.\\" Despite these concerns, an independent panel established by the Ex-Im Bank of the United States concluded, after five years of multi-disciplinary research, that the Camisea project has adhered to high environmental and social standards, and that its economic impact has been fundamental for Peru's economic growth.https://archive.org/details/SouthPeruPanel2014ConsolidatedReportFinalDraftEnglishForDelivering_201710 See also * Peru LNG References External links * \\"Inter-American Development Bank\\" * \\"Amazon Watch\\" Category:Natural gas fields in Peru Category:Natural gas pipelines in Peru ","title":"Camisea Gas Project"},{"id":"3641949","text":"Floria M√°rquez (born February 11, 1950 in Caracas) is a Venezuelan singer and actress.

Arc = Character overview in his early career = Felix Gaeta is known for his friendly, encouraging, trusting, and idealistic nature, although this idealism is somewhat dented by the events of the early part of the show's third season (2006-2007). \\"You're an idealist. There's no sin in that,\\" says Gaius Baltar. In college, Gaeta studied genetics but joined the military to pay for his education. Once in the military, he applied himself to his duties with great dedication, putting his social life and other concerns \\"on hold.\\" In the mini-series, Gaeta tells Commander Adama \\"it has been an honor serving with you for the last three years.\\" Gaeta serves as tactical officer on the Battlestar Galactica during the Cylon attack and subsequent escape. Following the fleet's flight from the Colonies, he is given tasks suited to his level of intelligence and education including helping his idol, Doctor Gaius Baltar, design a Cylon detector. He is generally very decisive and competent. However, in the chaos following the shooting of Commander William Adama, Gaeta forgets to check if the fleet had been updated with the latest jump coordinates. As a result, Galactica becomes separated from the fleet. However, Gaeta is also instrumental in solving this crisis: suggesting the ship's computers be networked to allow a quick re-calculation of the fleet's position. It is indicated Gaeta is friends with Anastasia Dualla. He has a great deal of respect for William Adama. = Chief of Staff to President Baltar = After the discovery of New Caprica, Gaeta uncovers a plot (involving Colonel Tigh and then-Petty Officer Anastasia Dualla, among others) to rig the presidential election in favor of President Laura Roslin over Gaius Baltar. Felix later serves as the latter's Chief of Staff during his presidency, and informs the President of the arrival of the Cylon fleet above New Caprica. Gaeta continues to serve as President Baltar's Chief of Staff throughout the Cylon occupation. However, he also acts as a spy for the resistance, providing them with information on security, personnel in the New Caprica Police, and radio frequencies. With his identity secret even from the resistance leadership, he is seen as a traitor by those he assists, and then- Chief Galen Tyrol remarks the day would come when he and other collaborators would receive their deserved justice. Tyrol says this to Jammer, who is a collaborator. Gaeta, for his part, feels profoundly let down by Baltar's lack of moral fortitude, and very nearly kills him during Galactica's rescue operation before giving Baltar one last chance to set things right. = Outcast = After the rescue of New Caprica's civilian population, Gaeta attempts to return to duty aboard Galactica, but is treated as persona non grata on account of his apparent collaboration. He is tried by a secret court known as The Circle whose jury members include Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol and Kara Thrace. Gaeta is convicted in absentia of collaborating with the Cylon occupation and being complicit in the deaths of hundreds. He is sentenced to death and brought to a Viper launch tube to be spaced. Circle member Kara Thrace's angry taunting of Gaeta ultimately provides the means by which his innocence is proved; Tyrol realizes that Gaeta was the anonymous resistance informant without whom the rescue by Galactica would have been impossible. Gaeta returns to duty, although he is still not exactly treated warmly by his shipmates. = Baltar's trial = In the episode \\"Taking a Break from All Your Worries\\", Gaeta offers to interrogate Baltar for Adama after Baltar's return to Galactica. Baltar discovers a camera in his cell and starts to provoke Gaeta, revealing he knows a secret about Gaeta. After Baltar whispers the \\"secret\\" inaudibly in Gaeta's ear, Gaeta stabs Baltar in the neck with a pen and attempts to strangle him before being restrained by Adama. (It is later revealed in the 2009 \\"The Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes that Baltar was aware of Gaeta's secret relationship with a duplicitous copy of Eight on New Caprica, which led to the death of numerous civilians. Baltar's whisper was revealed to be, \\"I know what your Eight did!\\") During Baltar's trial (in the episode \\"Crossroads\\"), Gaeta is put on the witness stand. He lies outright, claiming he was there when Baltar signed the death lists and Baltar offered no resistance in approving them. Since Baltar and the humanoid Cylons were in fact the only ones present, there was no way to prove Gaeta was perjuring himself. This leads to Baltar's defense team calling for a mistrial based on comments made by William Adama in a private conversation with Lee Adama. = Losing his leg = Gaeta continued to serve in a limited capacity in Galactica's CIC as a specialized tactical officer, as well as Astrometrics, but in the episode \\"The Ties That Bind\\" he is revealed to be one of the crew aboard the Demetrius, a ship commanded by Kara Thrace and tasked with finding the way to Earth. In \\"Faith\\", the crew attempts to imprison Thrace, but Samuel Anders, in an attempt to prevent this, shoots Gaeta in the leg. Thrace leaves in a Raptor, and Karl Agathon agrees to wait until the last possible moment for her to return. Gaeta pleads with Agathon to leave early, as delay in reaching medical care will likely result in the amputation of his leg. Agathon refuses, and in the next episode, Dr. Cottle removes Gaeta's leg below the knee. Gaeta refuses general anesthesia during the procedure, saying \\"I don't want to wake up with my leg gone\\", and after the leg's removal, he sings to take his mind off the resulting phantom limb symptoms. = Growing hatred of the Cylons = In \\"Revelations,\\" it becomes public knowledge that Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol (both Circle members) and Samuel Anders (responsible for Gaeta losing his leg) are all Cylons. In \\"Sometimes a Great Notion,\\" he notes to his friend Anastasia Dualla that she seems to have her smile back, but shortly after he leaves the room, she puts a gun to her head and shoots herself. He rushes back and desperately tries to save her, to no avail. In \\"The Face of the Enemy\\" (set between episodes 11 (Sometimes a Great Notion) and 12 of Season 4), Tigh orders Gaeta to take a medical leave of absence. Lt. Hoshi (with whom Gaeta appears to be having a relationship) places a five-pack of Morpha (presumably a narcotic similar to Morphine) into his hands just prior to his boarding the raptor scheduled to shuttle him to the Zephyr in order to relax. When the Cylons attack mid-flight, the fleet is ordered to make an emergency jump. The raptor emerges in uncharted space, most likely due to an error by the computer. Since they have no coordinates, everyone aboard is stranded‚Äîthere's no way to calculate a route back to the fleet.http://www.hulu.com/watch/48347 It is revealed that, back on New Caprica, Gaeta was involved in a relationship with an Eight, and he made lists of important resistance members in Cylon detention, whom she promised to try to save. With oxygen dwindling, Eight secretly begins killing the other crew members while Gaeta is asleep and convincing him that she is not responsible when he awakes. Gaeta ultimately realizes he has been played both here and on New Caprica. It is revealed on New Caprica she had been executing most of the key resistance members he had identified, occasionally releasing a few to allow Gaeta to continue his self-deception that he was actually making a difference. The Eight berates him for his willful blindness and his unwillingness to see the bigger picture. Gaeta snaps and kills her. He considers suicide, but Hoshi and Racetrack finally find him. Back aboard Galactica, Gaeta expresses distrust of the alliance with the Cylons and implies a major plan is in the works and ends his romantic relationship with Hoshi. = Alliance with Tom Zarek and mutiny = In \\"A Disquiet Follows My Soul,\\" Gaeta argues against giving the rebel Cylons access to the fleet's jump drives, but despite his opposition, Adama decides to continue with the plan. Gaeta provokes Kara Thrace about her Cylon husband, Samuel Anders, and points out that the jury which tried to convict him of treason included two Cylons and a woman married to a Cylon. When she leaves, he orders the door closed, saying he and the crew members \\"need to talk\\". Later, Gaeta visits Tom Zarek in his cell to inform him that he has rallied enough support (including the marine guarding Zarek), and expresses his belief that more people will join. He declares the world is upside down and someone has to turn it right side up, and asks Zarek if he is that person. Zarek accepts and tells Gaeta he will need him as his partner. In \\"The Oath\\", Gaeta, Tom Zarek, and numerous compatriots rebel against the authority of William Adama, Saul Tigh and Laura Roslin. Gaeta uses his position in charge of communications, as well as his knowledge of the ship to single-handedly orchestrate a mutiny aboard Galactica. In the ensuing chaos, Gaeta has Adama and Tigh arrested and takes command of the ship. Gaeta tells Adama he is removing him from command on the charge of treason. He tells Adama that he will not take orders from a Cylon and Adama is not the man he was when they started their journey. He believes the Admiral has let his friendship with Saul Tigh cloud his judgment. Adama warns him that there will be no forgiveness if they continue and that Gaeta will die with nothing. Gaius Baltar phones Gaeta to try to dissuade him from continuing with the mutiny. Baltar states his belief that Gaeta is an honorable man who is trying to do the right thing and forgives him for the attack in Taking a Break from All Your Worries. Gaeta rejects Baltar's attempt to change his mind. In the following episode, \\"Blood on the Scales\\", Gaeta demands that Adama call Roslin and request her surrender. Giving Gaeta his Admiral pins, Adama tells him he is the Admiral now and should call Roslin himself. After Zarek has the Quorum gunned down, Gaeta is shocked and insists he never agreed to this, he wanted the \\"truth\\" on their side. Zarek replies that this is what happens during a coup and there is no turning back. Despite Tom Zarek's reluctance, Gaeta insists on a trial for Adama. He accuses Adama of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. He expresses disgust with Adama's alliance with the Cylons, and allowing Saul Tigh to remain in his position as XO even after he discovered his friend was a Cylon. Later, in his quarters, Gaeta holds Adama's Admiral's pins, but throws them down on the desk, still not having worn them. With tears in his eyes, he calls Narcho to carry out the execution of William Adama, not knowing Lee Adama has already rescued his father. The pain in Gaeta's amputated leg increases with the stress of the decision. Roslin, having acquired the Cylons' support, vows to do everything in her power to destroy the mutineers. With the Cylon Basestar bearing down, Gaeta orders Galactica to jump away but Tyrol shuts down the ship's jump drives. Zarek desperately implores Gaeta to launch the Vipers in order to defend Galactica; however, Gaeta, realizing they would lose and the likelihood of massive bloodshed, decides to stand down. Shortly after, Adama retakes the CIC and arrests them. Meeting Baltar before his execution, Gaeta tells him that he accepts his defeat but hopes someday everyone will understand who he was‚Äîsomething Baltar understands. Zarek and Gaeta are both executed by firing squad. Gaeta's last words are, \\"It stopped,\\" a reference to the constant pain in his amputated leg. Sexuality Gaeta is bisexual. In an interview with AfterElton.com, Jane Espenson states that Gaeta is completely \\"out\\" to his crew but that they would not have that concept as it is not an issue in their world. She defines him as \\"someone entirely free of labels, who has probably had a number of relationships, mostly with males.\\" Gaeta is seen dancing with Sharon Valerii on Colonial Day in the episode \\"Colonial Day\\". In the webisodes The Face of the Enemy (which aired December 12, filling the gap between the break in season 4), Gaeta is shown to be in a romantic relationship with a man, Lieutenant Hoshi, one of the officers from the Battlestar Pegasus, and is also seen sharing a kiss with a female Number Eight Cylon during a flashback of the Cylons' occupation of New Caprica.

Its northern terminus is along the overlap of US 41 and US 129. It runs southwards as the \\"secret\\" designation of US 129 to Live Oak, where it splits off and runs independently south to Steinhatchee. The Hal W. Adams Bridge carries it across the Suwannee River three miles (5 km) north of Mayo. County Road 51 runs north from US 41/129 and SR 6 in Jasper to the Georgia border. Route description =Gulf of Mexico through Lafayette County= State Road 51 begins in Steinhatchee and throughout Taylor County, it follows the west bank of the Steinhatchee River. Within the community it runs along First Avenue South, Riverside Drive, both of which runs east and west. It then bears left onto Fourth Avenue South, which curves into 15th Street East, where it runs in its intended south-to-north direction for the first time. North of Steinhatchee SR 51 is named St. Linhatchee Drive and winds through the wetlands of southeastern Taylor County. After curving sharply to the northeast, the first truly major intersection is in Tennille, with the triple- overlap of US 19/98/ALT 27, a combination that spans from Chiefland to Perry. SR 51 curves back to the left, but still runs northeast. The road briefly enters the northwest corner of Dixie County near the Steinhatchee Springs Wildlife Management Area, only to cross over into Lafayette County. Still within the Steinhatchee Springs WMA, the road continues through southwestern Lafayette County, but suddenly starts to curve more to the east as it approaches the northern terminus of County Road 357 in Cooks Hammock. Continuing to curve to the east and move away from the southwestern portion of the county it crosses over the Steinhatchee River, but then starts to curve more northerly again, and even to the northwest before it approaches the western terminus of CR 360. The road curves back to the northeast and finally straightens out as it enters the Town of Mayo and becomes Fletcher Avenue. One other county road terminates at SR 51 in the town, specifically CR 355 which continues west as Pine Street. The much more important intersection is at the center of town which happens to be U.S. Route 27(West Main Street and East Man Street). From there it runs between Lafayette County Courthouse (Florida) which occupies the entire block between US 27 and Bloxham Street, and across the street the Old Mayo Free Press Building next door to the Old Lafayette County Courthouse which can be found on the southeast corner of SR 51 and Bloxham Street. The last county road in town is CR 400. Further north it intersects CR 534, and a block later it runs into the last routed intersection in Lafayette County which is CR 354 (South Convict Spring Road), but the last intersection in the county at large is with a cul-de-sac named Northeast Castagna Lane. North of there the road crosses the historic Hal W. Adams Bridge over the Suwannee River. =Suwannee County to Georgia State Line= As it crosses the Suwannee County Line, the road is given the name Irvin Avenue Northwest, a name it keeps throughout much of the county. Within Luraville it remains relatively straight at first as it passes through the Peacock Springs State Recreational Area, but starts to curve northeast, where it intersects the western terminus of CR 252, the northern terminus of CR 349, and the eastern terminus of CR 250. As it enters the historic City of Live Oak the road is named Irvin Avenue Southwest, and continues to run at the same northeast to southwest angle. This trajectory end at 11th Street where CR 136 officially joins SR 51 in an overlap, however both are overshadowed by US 129(South Ohio Avenue). It is at this point both routes turn left onto Ohio Avenue. Roughly two blocks later, the road encounters CR 10A (Helvenston Street Southeast). Further downtown it becomes the location for the Old Live Oak Post Office, and later, the Suwannee County Courthouse, and then the four corners of the city at U.S. Route 90(hidden SR 10), where US 129/SR 51's name changes from South Ohio Avenue to North Ohio Avenue, and US 90's name changes from West Howard Street to East Howard Street. One block later it crosses the railroad tracks where the historic Union Depot and Atlantic Coast Line Freight Station can be found, and the Old Live Oak City Hall can be found on the next block. It is here where the multiplex with State Road 136 ends at West Duval Street Northeast. After leaving the city limits, the road eventually becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches Interstate 10 at Exit 283, only to revert to a two-lane undivided road after it passes under the interchange. The only other intersection from here is CR 136A. The road enters Suwannee Springs, Florida, where it meets the intersection with CR 132, and secretly takes it north, as it prepares to make a second crossing over the Suwannee River. At this point it winds around another former bridge that carried SR 51, and eventually US 129 onto a much newer bridge, curving left and then right over the river as it enters Hamilton County. Unlike in Suwannee County, only a hint of the right-of-way of the former segment of US 129 can be found before the road turns straight north before letting go of its multiplex with CR 132, which runs east. Further north it enters the unincorporated community of Marion, where it intersects one other county road before meeting another interchange, this time Interstate 75 at Exit 451 Beyond that, it passes through Hillcoat, where US 129/SR 51 joins US 41 as well as hidden SRs 25 and 100. The newly overlapped routes briefly run straight north before making a reverse curve around the left side of Roberts Pond and Shaky Pond before entering the City of Jasper. US 41/129/SR 100 turns west onto State Road 6 (Hatley Street), which becomes County Road 6 east of the intersection, while County Road 51 (First Avenue Northeast) begins one block to the west. CR 51 runs briefly along First Avenue Northeast to Second Street Northeast, where it turns right, only to curve northeast again. Shortly after the curve, it has an at-grade crossing with a Georgia Southern and Florida Railway line that was following US 41 since Lake City. At Northeast 39th Drive, the road curves more northerly, although not necessarily straight north. The road winds through local Northern Florida forest land with occasional wetlands even as it passes through the barely existing community of Bakers Mill. After crossing a narrow bridge over the Little Alapaha River it intersects a dirt road named Northwest 13th Street which leads to US 129 near Avoca. The rest of the journey of CR 51 is surrounded by scrub forest. County Road 51 runs north to the Georgia border at a T intersection with two dirt roads named Flaline Break Road and Barnes Road, the latter of which is entirely dirt as far north as its terminus with State Route 94 at Tarver, Georgia.

The company was originally established in 1994 as a private consortium to own European Passenger Services and build the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) under a contract agreed with the government. After the full length of the CTRL was opened and rebranded as High Speed 1 (HS1) in late 2007, the company subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was nationalised by in June 2009. History =Creation= LCR was established in 1994 during the privatisation of British Rail. LCR bid for and won the contract from the UK government in 1996 to build and operate the Channel Tunnel Rail Link between London and the Channel Tunnel, under the terms of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996.London & Continental wins Eurostar and Channel Tunnel Rail Link THe Railway Magazine issue 1141 May 1996 page 9 As part of this deal European Passenger Services (EPS) and Union Railways, companies owned by British Rail, were transferred to LCR ownership, as well as key pieces of railway infrastructure including St Pancras railway station and the King's Cross Central lands nearby. EPS was the British arm of the joint Eurostar operation, along with SNCF in France and SNCB in Belgium. LCR renamed EPS as Eurostar (UK) Ltd (EUKL). Union Railways had been developing plans for the CTRL since before the opening of the Channel Tunnel and became the construction company of the CTRL under the ownership of LCR. The original shareholders of LCR were Bechtel (19%), Warburg (19%), Virgin Group (18%), National Express (17.5%), SNCF (8.5%), London Electricity (8.5%), Arup (3.5%), Halcrow (3%) and Systra (3%). As part of the 1996 contract, LCR was to finance and construct the CTRL itself, funding the project from income received from the Eurostar operation. LCR also planned to raise additional capital from a partial stock market flotation once the project was underway. =Financial problems= In January 1998 LCR ran into major financial difficulties after finding that income from its share of the Eurostar operation was not at the level it expected. It blamed the lower level of passenger growth on disruption caused by a November 1996 fire in the Channel Tunnel and the growth of competing low-cost airlines. LCR's planned flotation, which had already been delayed, was aborted. With the entire CTRL project in doubt, LCR appealed to the British government for help. =Government support= To enable the project to continue, LCR was allowed to issue ¬£3.7bn of private bonds, which the government pledged to guarantee. In return the government gained a percentage of future profits from the operation of the CTRL once completed, as well as a golden share in LCR. As part of the deal LCR was forced to appoint a management contract for EUKL. This was won by Inter-Capital and Regional Rail (ICRR), a consortium of National Express (40%), SNCF (35%), SNCB (15%) and British Airways (10%). The contract was to run from 1998 until 2010. Following the access to finance, LCR was able to begin the CTRL project. Rail Link Engineering (RLE) was appointed to design and engineer the CTRL. RLE was a group made up of the four engineering companies involved in LCR; Bechtel (50%), Arup (19%), Halcrow (17%) and Systra (14%). In addition, Railtrack was brought into the project by the government and agreed to purchase the CTRL from LCR once completed. To reduce the risks surrounding the project, the construction was split into two phases. Section 1, from the Channel Tunnel to Fawkham Junction in Kent, was to be managed by Union Railways (South) under the control of Railtrack, who committed to purchase Section 1 from LCR once complete for the cost of its construction. The more complex part, Section 2 running from Fawkham Junction to London St Pancras was to be managed by Union Railways (North). Railtrack also purchased an option, to be exercised by 2003, to control Union Railways (North) during construction and acquire Section 2 once complete. It was intended that with the completed full-length CTRL then in Railtrack's future ownership, EUKL would then pay track access charges to use the line. =Railtrack crisis= Following a series of rail accidents and a subsequent share price collapse, Railtrack announced in April 2001 that it would not take up its option to project manage and then purchase Section 2. Instead, Section 2 would be owned on completion by LCR, with Railtrack owning Section 1 as well as being responsible for operating both sections. In October 2001, Railtrack was placed into \\"railway administration\\" with debts of ¬£7.1bn and in October 2002 Railtrack's assets were transferred to a newly created \\"not for dividend\\" company called Network Rail, whose debts would be guaranteed by the government. LCR re-purchased Railtrack's interest in Section 1 for ¬£295m, meaning that both sections would once again be in LCR's ownership upon subsequent competition. Network Rail agreed to pay LCR ¬£80m for the right to operate and maintain HS1 on LCR's behalf once complete. =CTRL completion= Section 1 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was completed in September 2003 and handed over by Union Railways (South) to London and Continental Railways. Eurostar services started using Section 1, leading to international journey reductions of approximately 20 minutes. In March 2006 LCR shareholders rejected a takeover bid led by businessman Adrian Montague. Shortly afterwards the Office for National Statistics reclassified LCR as a public corporation due to LCR's reliance on government funding and the resulting high levels of influence the government enjoyed over the company. The Channel Tunnel Railway Link was finally finished when Section 2 was completed and handed over by Union Railways (North) to LCR. In November 2007 the full length of the line was opened to the public, rebranded as High Speed 1 (HS1) with Eurostar trains operating international train services from St Pancras railway station, and a further 20-minute journey time reduction. =Nationalisation= Following the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary Provisions) Act 2008, the Department for Transport took direct ownership of LCR in June 2009 for a nominal price. This was possible due to the company's dependence on ¬£5.1bn of government- guaranteed debt, and the government's special share in LCR giving it a wide range of control over the business.Government acquires LCR Railway Gazette International July 2009 page 9 The government stated it planned to sell off LCR's assets, such as EUKL and HS1, as individual companies to recoup some of the large amounts of government money paid to LCR since 1998. =Eurostar restructuring= On 31 December 2009, EUKL was renamed Eurostar International Limited (EIL). On 1 September 2010, the three national Eurostar operators merged into a single company with a single management structure. Following this change, the ICRR management contract for the UK business was terminated. All Eurostar assets were transferred to EIL, with LCR's holding in the new company becoming 40%. The remaining shares were held by SNCF (55%) and SNCB (5%). =High Speed 1 concession= In November 2010, a 30-year concession to own and operate HS1 was sold to a Canadian consortium of Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for ¬£2.1bn. =BRB (Residuary) assets= Following the abolition of BRB (Residuary) Limited (BRBR) on 30 September 2013, LCR took ownership of a number of former British Rail offices in Croydon, Derby, Manchester and Birmingham, as well as sites in Oxford and Leeds. It also took over the management of the closed Waterloo International railway station and North Pole depot, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport. The remaining BRBR assets and responsibilities were split between the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Rail Safety and Standards Board. =Eurostar divestment= On 4 December 2013, the government announced that it intended to sell LCR's 40% stake in EIL. In June 2014, the shareholding was transferred from LCR to HM Treasury and the sale process was subsequently launched on 13 October 2014. The sale was completed in March 2015, raising a grand total of ¬£760 million. Current operations LCR is a state-owned railway property development company. It is involved in a number of regeneration projects on former railway land, including King's Cross Central, Stratford City and Manchester Mayfield. It also manages the closed Waterloo International railway station and North Pole depot, as well as providing property advice to HS2 Limited.

It is approximately long and drains an area of about . The river is fed by rainfall and snowmelt, resulting in a peak discharge in spring and low water in summer and early fall. Two dams have been built on the Little Zab, regulating the river flow, providing water for irrigation and generating hydroelectricity. The Zagros Mountains have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic, but the earliest archaeological site in the Little Zab basin, Barda Balka, dates to the Middle Palaeolithic. Human occupation of the Little Zab basin has been attested for every period since then.  Course  The Little Zab rises in the Zagros Mountains in Iran at an elevation of circa amsl. In its upper reaches, the course of the Little Zab is determined by the alignment of the major mountain chains that make up the Zagros. Thus, the river flows through valleys that are predominantly aligned along a northwest‚Äìsoutheast axis, parallel to the major mountain chains of the Zagros, only to change its direction abruptly where it cuts through these chains in narrow gorges. The Little Zab enters the plain south of Dukan, where it first assumes a roughly westward course before turning to the southwest upstream from the town of Altun Kopru and uniting with the Tigris near the town of Al Zab. Most tributaries join the Little Zab upstream from Dukan, with the largest being the Baneh River and the Qala Chulan. A number of smaller streams joined the Little Zab in the Ranya Plain, which is now partly inundated by Lake Dukan. Different estimates have been given for the length of the Little Zab: , and . For a short distance, the Little Zab forms the border between Iran and Iraq, and along its lower course it also constitutes the border between Erbil Governorate and Sulaymaniyah Governorate, and Erbil and Kirkuk Governorates. The river is fed by snowmelt and rainfall, resulting in a peak discharge in the period February‚ÄìMay. Low water levels are recorded for the period July‚ÄìOctober. The average discharge of the Little Zab is per second, whereas the maximum recorded discharge is per second. Average annual discharge is . Because of its torrential nature, Medieval Arab geographers have described the Little Zab, and the Great Zab as well, as \\"demoniacally possessed\\".  Watershed  The drainage basin of the Little Zab covers ; from the location where the Dukan Dam has been constructed, it measures . The larger part of the basin (74%) is located within Iraqi borders; the remainder is in Iran. On the north, it is bordered by the Great Zab basin while on the south it is adjoined by the basins of the Adhaim and Diyala rivers. The parallel mountain ranges of the Zagros consist of limestone folds rising to elevations over . Water erosion has filled the Little Zab valley and the foothill zone south-west of the Zagros with layers of gravel, conglomerate, and sandstone. The Ranya Plain is the largest valley in the Little Zab drainage basin, and the second-largest in the Iraqi Zagros behind the Shahrazor. The Little Zab crosses very diverse climatic and ecological zones. Annual precipitation along the course of the river diminishes from over in the Iranian Zagros to less than at the confluence with the Tigris near Al Zab. Average temperatures follow a similar gradient, with the mountain valleys generally experiencing colder winters than the foothill zone, while summers in the latter are hotter. In the high Zagros, three different ecozones can be distinguished. The tree line is at approximately ; above which herbs and shrubs predominate. The dominant vegetation between was an open oak forest (Quercus aegilops), but not much of this original vegetation remains. The river valleys are characterized by water-loving plants, and marshy areas were in the past ‚Äì in the absence of drainage ‚Äì prone to malaria. Although the foothill zone, especially the plain of Erbil, is heavily cultivated, patches of natural vegetation remain, with herbs in the genus Phlomis being very common.  River modifications  Two dams have been constructed on the Little Zab in Iraq while Iran is currently constructing one with two others planned. The two in Iraq are the Dukan Dam and the Dibis Dam. The Dukan Dam was constructed between 1957 and 1961 as a multi-purpose arch dam upstream from the town of Dukan. The dam‚Äôs crest is above the riverbed ( amsl) and long. Its functions are to regulate the flow of the Little Zab, to store water for irrigation in its reservoir (Lake Dukan) and to provide hydroelectric power. The maximum storage capacity of the dam‚Äôs reservoir is . Because the flooding of Lake Dukan would lead to the submersion of numerous archaeological sites, an archaeological survey and rescue excavations were carried out in the endangered region ‚Äì notably at the sites of Tell Shemshara and Tell Bazmusian. The Dibis Dam is located approximately upstream from the confluence with the Tigris and was constructed between 1960 and 1965. The embankment dam is long and wide and provides water for the Kirkuk Irrigation Project. Currently under construction in Iran is the Sardasht Dam. Construction began in 2011 and when complete, the tall embankment dam will support a 120 MW power station. Above the Sardasht Dam, Iran is planning to construct the Shivahan and Garjhal Dams with the primary purpose of power generation.  History  Although Iraqi Kurdistan is not well known from an archaeological point of view, the available evidence nevertheless shows that the relatively favourable ecological conditions of the Iraqi part of the Zagros attracted human groups from early prehistory onwards. Lower Palaeolithic archaeological sites have to date not been found in the Iraqi part of the Zagros Mountains, but they are known from the Iranian side where numerous cave sites have been found during archaeological surveys. Information on the early prehistory of the wider Little Zab region itself comes from the excavations carried out by the Oriental Institute at archaeological sites east of Kirkuk and south of the Little Zab. The earliest evidence for human occupation in this region comes from the Middle Palaeolithic site of Barda Balka, where Late Acheulean stone tools have been found. Archaeological research elsewhere in the Zagros confirms the importance of this area to early human hunter-gatherers ‚Äì including groups of Neanderthals as evidenced by the finds in Shanidar Cave in the Great Zab basin. Mousterian stone tools that were used by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans have recently been excavated in Erbil, between the Little Zab and the Great Zab. Both open- air and cave sites are attested for the Zarzian culture, which straddles the Upper and Epipalaeolithic periods. After the Zarzian, the focus of human occupation shifted from cave-sites, which continue to be used as secondary or seasonal occupation sites up to today, to open-air sites and it was in this period that the trend toward domestication of plants and animals set in. Domestication of the goat probably occurred first in this area of the Zagros. Jarmo, a tell east of Kirkuk, was a Neolithic village community that practiced agriculture and animal husbandry. Pottery occurs from the early occupation levels onward; in its later phases it resembles pottery from Hassuna. The early occupation of Tell Shemshara, in the Ranya Plain, can also be dated to this period. The archaeological fieldwork in the Ranya Plain showed that this area was occupied during the Ubaid, Uruk and Ninevite V periods ‚Äì roughly from the middle 6th to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Evidence for these periods comes from the Citadel of Erbil as well. The region enters history at the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, when Erbil is mentioned as Urbilum by king Shulgi of the Ur III dynasty. From that time onward, the Little Zab basin became increasingly entangled in the affairs of the successive Mesopotamian empires that sought control over the Zagros Mountains. In the early second millennium BCE, king Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia waged war to the land of Qabra, which was probably located along the lower course of the Little Zab, and installed garrisons in the conquered towns. The archive of clay tablets found at Tell Shemshara (ancient Shusharra) shows that the local governor switched allegiance and became a vassal of Shamshi-Adad. During the 14th century BCE, the region was part of the Mitannian kingdom, with sites like Nuzi and Tell al-Fakhar, south of the Little Zab, yielding clay tablet archives for this period. During the late second‚Äìearly first millennia BCE, the lower Little Zab basin belonged to the heartland of the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian empires. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, control of the Zagros shifted first to the Medes and in 550 BCE to the Achaemenid Empire. The last Achaemenid ruler Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela in northern Iraq and after Alexander‚Äôs death in 323, the area fell to his Seleucid successors.

The male is differentiated by the female by its thick bright red malar stripe. The yellow plumage may darken to a browner or darker tone if soiled. The cream-colored woodpecker is 24‚Äì26 cm in height and weighs 95-130g.  Taxonomy  The four recognized subspecies of Celeus flavus are C. f. flavus, C.f. peruvianus, C.f. tectricialis and C.f. subflavus. These subspecies interbreed and produce many intermediates, blurring their original designated geographical boundaries. C.f. subflavus is significantly larger than its nominate, weighing on average 200g.  Range and Habitat  Native to South America, from Colombia, Venezuela and the Guianas to Peru, Bolivia, and the eastern part of Brazil, including a southeast Brazil coastal strip. The cream-colored woodpecker inhabits rainforests, mangroves, forests near water, deciduous woodland as well as cacao plantations. It does not migrate.  Behavior  = Vocalization = The cream-colored woodpecker emits a high- pitched laugh: \\"wutchuk kee-hoo-hoo-hoo\\" or \\"pueer, pueer, purr, paw\\" with the final note in a lower pitch. During interaction with other bird species, it may repeat \\"kiu-kiu-kiu-kiu\\". Less raspy and higher pitched than vocalizations of Chestnut woodpeckers (Celeus elegans). = Diet = Diet consists mainly of arboreal ants and termites, but generally supplemented by seeds and fruit. Forages singly and in groups, on trees as well as the ground. Frequently sighted pecking at termite nests on trees. = Breeding = April to June in Colombia and slightly earlier in Venezuela. Nesting habits have not been documented.  Status and Conservation  The cream-colored woodpecker is considered as generally uncommon but has been established as of Least Concern status. However, due to decreases every year in suitable habitat, it is predicted to decrease in population numbers over the next few decades.

It rises in Turkey near Lake Van and joins the Tigris in Iraq south of Mosul. The drainage basin of the Great Zab covers approximately , and during its course, the rivers collects the water from many tributaries. The river and its tributaries are primarily fed by rainfall and snowmelt ‚Äì as a result of which discharge fluctuates highly throughout the year. At least six dams have been planned on the Great Zab and its tributaries, but construction of only one, the Bekhme Dam, has commenced but was halted after the Gulf War. The Zagros Mountains have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic, and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been testified at the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave. Historical records for the region are available from the end of the third millennium BCE onward. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud. The Battle of the Zab ‚Äì which ended the Umayyad Caliphate ‚Äì took place near a tributary of the Great Zab, and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Great Zab basin saw frequent uprisings of local Kurdish tribes striving for autonomy.  Course  The Great Zab rises in Turkey in the mountainous region east of Lake Van at an elevation of approximately amsl and joins the Tigris on its left bank in Iraq. In Turkey, the Great Zab traverses the provinces of Van and Hakk√¢ri, whereas in Iraq it flows through Duhok Governorate and Erbil Governorate, both part of the Kurdistan Region. Together with the Tigris, the Great Zab forms the boundary between Erbil Governorate and Ninawa Governorate. In its upper reaches, the Great Zab flows through steep, rocky gorges. The stretch between Amadiya and the Bekhme Gorge, where the Bekhme Dam remains unfinished, has been called the Sapna valley and will have a large portion of it inundated with water if the project is completed. Numerous mountain streams and wadis join the Great Zab on its right and left banks. The Great Zab receives most of its waters from the left-bank tributaries; the Rubar-i-Shin, Rukuchuk, Rubar-i-Ruwandiz, Rubat Mawaran and Bastura Chai. The length of the Great Zab has been variously estimated at and . Approximately of the river's course are located within Iraq. The average discharge of the Great Zab is per second, but peak discharges of up to per second have been recorded. The average annual discharge is . Because of its torrential nature, Medieval Arab geographers have described the Great Zab ‚Äì together with the Little Zab ‚Äì as \\"demoniacally possessed\\".  Watershed  Estimates of the drainage basin of the Great Zab vary widely ‚Äì from a low to a high figure of . Approximately 62 percent of the basin is located in Iraq; the remainder is in Turkey. To the south, the Great Zab basin borders on that of the Little Zab while on the east it adjoins the Tigris basin. The Zagros consists of parallel limestone folds rising to elevations of over amsl. The valleys ‚Äì including that of the Great Zab ‚Äì and the south-western foothill zone are filled with gravel, conglomerate, and sandstone; the result of water erosion. The Amadiya valley within the Great Zab drainage basin is the third- largest valley in the Iraqi Zagros, after the Shahrazor and the Ranya Plain. The Great Zab rises in the highlands of the Zagros Mountains, where a climate with cold winter and annual precipitation in excess of prevails. From there, the river flows into the foothill zone of the Zagros, where rainfall drops to less than per year at the confluence with the Tigris. Average summer temperature in the foothill zone are generally higher in the foothill zone than in the mountains. The high Zagros is characterized by three different ecozones: the area above the treeline at where shrubs and herbs dominate, the area between that was in the past dominated by open oak forest (Quercus aegilops), and the wetter and sometimes marshy river valleys. Other trees besides oak that can be found in the forested zone including juniper at higher elevations; ash, hawthorn, maple and walnut at intermediate elevations; and pistachio and olive trees in lower, drier areas. In the foothill zone, many areas are now cultivated, but there remain small patches of natural vegetation dominated by herbs of the genus Phlomis.  River modifications  To date, one large dam has been partially constructed on the Great Zab: Iraq's Bekhme Dam and Turkey's 24 MW weir-controlled run-of-the-river Baƒüƒ±≈ülƒ± Hydroelectric Power Plant. Five others have been planned in the Great Zab basin by both Turkey and Iraq. Turkey's State Hydraulic Works plans to construct the √áukurca and Doƒüanlƒ± Dams near √áukurca and the Hakk√¢ri Dam near the city of Hakk√¢ri. The Hakk√¢ri Dam with a 245 MW power station is in final design and the √áukurca and Doƒüanlƒ± Dams will support 245 MW and 462 MW power stations, respectively. Iraq has commenced construction of the Bekhme and Deralok Dams and planned two others ‚Äì the Khazir-Gomel and Mandawa Dams. Plans to build a dam in the Great Zab at the Bekhme Gorge for flood control and irrigation were first proposed in 1937. A feasibility study determined that the site was not suited for dam construction and the plan was abandoned. In 1976, another study proposed three different locations on the Great Zab, including the site suggested in the earlier study. This site was eventually chosen in 1989, when work on the dam commenced. Construction of the Bekhme Dam was interrupted by the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990 and the dam remains unfinished. After the war, the site of the dam was looted. The plans of the Bekhme Dam called for a high rockfill dam and an underground hydroelectric power station housing six turbines with a total capacity of 1,560 MW. The reservoir that would have been created by the Bekhme Dam would have a storage capacity of and would have flooded numerous villages, the archaeological site of Zawi Chemi Shanidar and the access road to Shanidar Cave (although not the cave itself).  History  alt=An entrance to a cave in a wooded hillside Evidence for human occupation of the Zagros reaches back into the Lower Palaeolithic, as evidenced by the discovery of many cave-sites dating to that period in the Iranian part of the mountain range. Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages are known from Barda Balka, a cave-site south of the Little Zab; and from the Iranian Zagros. A Mousterian stone tool assemblage ‚Äì produced by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans ‚Äì was recently excavated in Erbil. Neanderthals also occupied the site of Shanidar. This cave-site, located in the Sapna Valley, has yielded a settlement sequence stretching from the Middle Palaeolithic up to the Epipalaeolithic period. The site is particularly well known for its Neanderthal burials. The Epipalaeolithic occupation of Shanidar, contemporary with the use of the Kebaran stone tool assemblage, is the oldest evidence for anatomically modern human occupation of the Great Zab basin. The following Protoneolithic, or Natufian, occupation is contemporary with the oldest occupation of the nearby open-air site Zawi Chemi Shanidar. M'lefaat on the Khazir River (a tributary to the Great Zab) was a small village of hunter- gatherers dating to the 10th millennium BCE that was contemporary with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A in the Levant. An archaeological survey of the Citadel of Erbil, in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab, has shown that this site was continuously occupied at least from the 6th millennium BCE upward. The earliest historical reference to the region dates to the Ur III dynasty, when king Shulgi mentioned the city of Urbilum ‚Äì the ancient name of modern-day Erbil. The great Assyrian capitals of Assur, Nineveh, Nimrud and Dur-Sharrukin were all located in the foothill zone where the Great Zab flows into the Tigris, and the Great Zab basin became increasingly integrated into the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian empires. Nimrud, the capital of the empire until 706 BCE, was located only away from the confluence of the Great Zab with the Tigris. The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II constructed a canal called Patti-Hegalli that tapped water from the Great Zab to irrigate the land around Nimrud, and this canal was restored by his successors Tiglath-Pileser III and Esarhaddon. This canal ran along the right bank of the Great Zab and cut through a rock bluff by means of a tunnel and is still visible today. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian empire, the Medes gained control of the area, followed by the Achaemenids in 550 BCE. The Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE ‚Äì one of the decisive battles leading to the fall of the Achaemenid empire at the hands of Alexander the Great ‚Äì supposedly took place north of the Great Zab in the vicinity of Mosul. After Alexander‚Äôs death in 323 BCE, control of the area shifted to the Seleucids. In 750 CE, the last Umayyad caliph Marwan II was defeated by the Abbasid As-Saffah in the Battle of the Zab on the banks of the Khazir River, a tributary to the Great Zab. When the Mongols swept over Iraq in the 13th century and sacked Erbil, many survivors sought a refuge in the inaccessible valleys of the Great Zab. The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim communities, as evidenced by Christian artefacts found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar. During the 19th century, the area was controlled by local Kurdish leaders. During World War I, heavy fighting took place in the area, and Rowanduz was pillaged by Russian soldiers in 1916. Following World War I, episodes of heavy fighting took place between the Barzani tribe ‚Äì striving for the establishment of an independent Kurdish polity ‚Äì and several other Kurdish tribes, and between the Barzanis and the Iraqi Government. The last of these uprisings started in 1974 and led to heavy bombardments of towns and villages in the Great Zab basin.

From 1928 to 1932, he was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, then an all-boys independent school. RAF career Townsend joined the Royal Air Force in 1933 and trained at RAF Cranwell. He was commissioned a pilot officer on 27 July 1935. On graduation, he joined No. 1 Squadron RAF at RAF Tangmere flying the Hawker Fury biplane fighter. In 1936 he was posted to No. 36 Squadron RAF in Singapore, flying the Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bomber.Townsend, P. Time and Chance 1978 Book Club Associates pp84-93 with squadron photograph He was promoted to flying officer on 27 January 1937, and returned to Tangmere that year as a member of No. 43 Squadron RAF. Townsend was promoted to flight lieutenant on 27 January 1939. The first enemy aircraft to crash on English soil during the Second World War fell victim to fighters from RAF Acklington in Northumberland on 3 February 1940, when three Hurricanes of ‚ÄòB‚Äô flight, No. 43 Squadron, shot down a Luftwaffe Heinkel 111 of 4./KG 26 near Whitby. The pilots were Flight Lieutenant Townsend, Flying Officer \\"Tiger\\" Folkes and Sergeant James Hallowes. Two more He 111s were claimed by Townsend, on 22 February and 8 April, and a sixth share on 22 April. Enemy aircraft had been shot down in 1939 by the RAF from over Scotland's Scapa Flow naval base during the Luftwaffe's first raid on Britain. Townsend was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in April 1940: Squadron Leader Townsend of No. 85 Squadron RAF exits his Hawker Hurricane at RAF Castle Camps, July 1940 By May 1940, Townsend was one of the most capable squadron leaders of the Battle of Britain, serving throughout the battle as commanding officer of No. 85 Squadron RAF, flying Hawker Hurricanes. On 11 July 1940, Acting Squadron Leader Townsend, flying Hurricane VY-K (P2716) intercepted a Dornier Do 17 of KG 2 and severely damaged the bomber, forcing it to crash land at Arras. Return fire from the Dornier hit the Hurricane coolant system and Townsend was forced to ditch from the English coast, being rescued by HM Trawler Cape Finisterre. He was mentioned in despatches the same month. On 31 August, during combat with Messerschmitt Bf 110s over Tonbridge, Townsend was shot down and wounded in the left foot by a cannon shell which went through the glycol tank and exploded in the cockpit. He continued to lead the unit on the ground even after this wound resulted in his big toe being amputated, and he returned to operational flying on 21 September. Townsend was promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader on 1 September 1940. A Bar to his DFC was awarded in early September 1940, for leading his squadron in protecting convoys during July and August 1940, personally shooting down four enemy aircraft and leading his squadron in destroying at least 10 enemy aircraft and damaging many others. Part of his citation reads: Townsend oversaw the conversion of No. 85 Squadron to night operations at RAF Hunsdon in Hertfordshire during early 1941. In May 1941, by now an acting wing commander and credited with shooting down at least 11 enemy aircraft, Townsend was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). His citation credited Townsend as an officer who had Townsend was promoted to the temporary rank of wing commander on 1 December 1941. He later became commanding officer of RAF Drem in Scotland in April 1942 and commanded No. 611 Squadron RAF, a Spitfire unit. He was later leader of No. 605 Squadron RAF, a night fighter unit, and attended the staff college from October 1942. In January 1943, he was appointed commanding officer of RAF West Malling in Kent. His wartime record was nine aircraft claimed destroyed, and two shared, two 'probables' and four damaged. In 1944, Townsend was appointed temporary equerry to King George VI. In the same year, the appointment was made permanent, and he served until 1953 when he became Extra Equerry, an honorary office he held until his death. He ended his wartime service with the temporary rank of wing commander and was promoted to the permanent rank of wing commander on 1 January 1949. In August 1950, Townsend was made deputy Master of the Household and was moved to comptroller to the Queen Mother in 1952. He was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1953, and retired from the Royal Household the same year. Townsend served as air attach√© in Brussels from 1953 to 1956, when he retired from the RAF. Later life Townsend spent much of his later years writing non-fiction books. His books include Earth My Friend (about driving/boating around the world alone in the mid-1950s), Duel of Eagles (about the Battle of Britain), The Odds Against Us (also known as Duel in the Dark, about fighting Luftwaffe night bombers in 1940‚Äì1941), The Last Emperor (a biography of King George VI), The Girl in the White Ship (about a young refugee from Vietnam in the late 1970s who was the sole survivor of her ship of refugees), The Postman of Nagasaki (about the atomic bombing of Nagasaki), and Time and Chance (an autobiography). He also wrote many short articles and contributed to other books. Townsend was a director of one of Gerald Carroll's Carroll Group companies.\\"SFO looks at 500m fall of Carroll empire\\", Dominic O'Connell, Sunday Business, 1 October 2000, p. 1. Townsend was one of several military advisors for the film Battle of Britain (1969). He also appeared in the PBS video, The Windsors: A Royal Family (1994). Personal life On 17 July 1941, Townsend married (Cecil) Rosemary Pawle (1921‚Äì2004). They had two sons, Giles (1942‚Äì2015) and Hugo (b. 1945). The younger son married Yolande, Princess of Ligne, daughter of Antoine, 13th Prince of Ligne and Alix, Princess of Ligne (n√©e Princess Alix of Luxembourg). Townsend and Pawle divorced in 1952. Pawle married, secondly, John de L√°szl√≥ (son of the painter Philip de L√°szl√≥), and thirdly, in 1978, the 5th Marquess Camden. After the divorce, Townsend and Princess Margaret formed a relationship and decided to marry. He had met her in his role as an equerry to her father, King George VI. Divorcees suffered severe disapproval in the social atmosphere of the time and could not re-marry in the Church of England if their former spouse was still alive. Their relationship was considered especially controversial because Margaret's sister, Queen Elizabeth II, was the Church's Supreme Governor. When news of the relationship appeared in the press, the government posted Townsend to a position as air attach√© at the British Embassy in Brussels. On 31 October 1955, Princess Margaret issued a statement ending the relationship: \\"I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teachings that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before others.\\" The BBC interrupted its scheduled radio programme to broadcast the statement.\\"1955: Princess Margaret cancels wedding\\". \\"On This Day\\", BBC.Nikkhah, Roya (7 November 2009). \\"Princess Margaret: recently unearthed letter sheds new light on decision not to marry\\". The Daily Telegraph. In 1959, aged 45, Townsend married 20-year-old Marie-Luce Jamagne, a Belgian national he had met the previous year. They had two daughters and one son. Their younger daughter, Isabelle Townsend, became a Ralph Lauren model in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Isabelle Townsend and her family renovated and lived at Le Moulin de la Tuilerie in Gif-sur-Yvette, where the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had once lived. Death and legacy Stele of the grave in the churchyard of Saint-L√©ger-en-Yvelines, France. Townsend died of stomach cancer in 1995, in Saint-L√©ger-en-Yvelines, France. He was 80 years old. In 2002, a sculpture of Townsend, designed by Guy Portelli, was erected at Townsend Square, part of the Kings Hill development, on the site formerly occupied by the RAF West Malling airfield. In popular culture Townsend is portrayed by Ben Miles in the 2016 Netflix television series The Crown.

It has a population of 28,714 people, most of them of Italian descent . The city is famous for its wine and champagne productions. The name Garibaldi is a homage to the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi and his Brazilian wife, Anita Garibaldi. It was settled by Italian immigrants, predominantly Venetians and Prussians in the late 19th century.Garibaldi Official Site - City Profile , Original language: Portuguese. Translated on 28 February 2009. History =The beginning= In 1870, chairman Dr. Jo√£o Sert√≥rio created the colony of Conde d'Eu, in honor of the emperor's son-in-law, who married Princess Isabel. The two colonies had 32 square leagues of land. The region did not attract much interest, because its lands were rugged. An infrastructure investment was necessary to attract settlers, but as the government was not willing to make such an investment, the settlement sought other resources to make the land habitable and arable. The government decided to populate the region with European immigrants. The settlement of Colony Conde d'Eu occurred at the end of the imperial stage. The first immigrants arrived on July 9, 1870 and they were all Prussians (Germans). At the same period, some Amerindian families, or \\"Bugres\\" as they were commonly identified, also settled there. During this period of settlement, the Germans lived on subsistence agriculture. At that time, the only existing road, which was in terrible condition, connected Conde D'Eu to Montenegro through Marat√°. Using this road, some Swiss, Italian, French, Austrian and Polish immigrants arrived in 1874 and 1875. =Italian settlement= The largest number of immigrants came from Italy. The Colony Conde d'Eu was the first nucleus of colonization in mountain region of Rio Grande do Sul. The population of the colony, which in 1875 was of only 720 inhabitants, reached 870 persons in 1876. From 1890, when the colony was established, the houses and buildings that today form the Historical Center were built. On October 31, 1900, the government raised the Colony Conde d'Eu to a municipality, which then became Garibaldi. Today, almost all the inhabitants of the city are descended from immigrants . Wine and sparkling wine productions When the Italian immigrants came to Garibaldi they brought vineyards. Over time, wine production became very important to the regional economy. More recently, sparkling wine also started to be produced there, and the town is now the main producer of the beverage in Brazil.

It connects the regions of Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur and Occitanie to the LGV Rh√¥ne-Alpes, and from there to Lyon and the north of France. Construction costs rose to ‚Ç¨3.8 billion; the line entered service in June 2001 following an inauguration by President Jacques Chirac. The commencement of service on this line has led to a reversal of the respective airplane and train markets: by making Marseille reachable in three hours from Paris‚Äîa distance of over 750 kilometres (470 miles)‚Äîthe train now handles two thirds of all journeys on that route. Route The LGV M√©diterran√©e begins in the southeast at Saint- Marcel-l√®s-Valence, as the extension of the LGV Rh√¥ne-Alpes. The new Gare de Valence TGV lies at the interchange with the regular Valence-Grenoble line, allowing rapid connections towards Valence, Romans-sur-Is√®re and Grenoble. At Crest, an emergency link is provided to the Brian√ßon-Loriol line. The LGV then approaches the Rh√¥ne, rejoining the A7 autoroute at Mont√©limar. After crossing the Canal de Donz√®re-Mondragon, the line connects to the regular network by an emergency link situated between Pierrelatte and Lapalud. Spanning the Rh√¥ne three times (twice at Mornas, once north of Roquemaure), the LGV continues to Angles, where a triangle allows access to the southwest and southeast. The southwest branch is generally thought of as the beginning of a future LGV Languedoc-Roussillon, joining the regular Avignon-N√Æmes line later at Redessan; there are plans to construct a Contournement ferroviaire de N√Æmes et Montpellier. The southeast branch crosses the Rh√¥ne again on two parallel viaducts and serves the new Avignon-TGV station, then follows the Durance which it crosses at Orgon. At Ventabren, a viaduct extends across the A8 autoroute, the D10 and the Canal de Provence. The line then dives southward, serving the new Aix-en-Provence-TGV station, traverses the long Tunnel de Marseille and re-joins the regular network at the entry to Marseille. Stations Overall TGV system map showing the route of the LGV M√©diterran√©e and connections with other lines. * Gare de Valence TGV at Saint-Marcel-l√®s- Valence; a unique two-level station (below, TGVs; above, TERs) which allows rapid connections towards Valence, Grenoble and Romans-sur-Is√®re * Gare d'Avignon TGV south of Avignon; its proximity to the city centre has ensured its popularity. An enhancement to the station allowed it to be served by local services connecting to Avignon's central station, amongst others. * Gare d'Aix-en-Provence TGV near the R√©altor reservoir, halfway between Aix-en- Provence and Marseille Airport; this station has proved more popular than expected and serves the north of the Marseille area. It is also recommended by agents for ships in Fos-Lavera-Port de Bouc, in preference to Marseille. The station has a road connection to Aix-en-Provence, but no classic rail connection as with Valence TGV. Controversy * Numerous protests, particularly from well connected wine growers of the Rh√¥ne Valley, made President Mitterrand force alterations to the route; the original path would have kept to the left bank of the river, while the final route skirts the river and crosses it four times, at a significantly higher cost. * The nearly long line currently has no regularly used connection to the classic network (unless one considers the southwest branch as a connector). Numerous connections had however been proposed: ** a link at Saint-Marcel-l√®s-Valence between the LGV (southwards) and the regular line (eastwards), accompanied by the electrification of the Valence-Grenoble line. This would permit direct connections between Grenoble and the Mediterranean; instead, passengers traveling between Marseille and Grenoble must change at Valence-TGV; with the Valence to Geneva line through Grenoble now electrified, this link becomes more attractive and a connection is considered for the near-future; another link from the LGV (southwards) to the regular line (towards Valence) would have enabled service to Valence central station from the south; ** a link at Roquemaure from the north towards Avignon would not only have enabled service to Avignon central station, but would have enabled faster service for Arles. A link south of Avignon would equally have permitted the linking of Avignon central station with Marseille in 25 minutes ** the regular use of the existing link at Pierrelatte would have enabled rapid service to Orange from the north, as well as Avignon and Arles, given that no link was created at Roquemaure ** a link at Orgon with the Avignon-Miramas line via Cavaillon would have enabled service to Salon-de-Provence, Miramas and Istres from the north * Mont√©limar wanted a TGV station. This would offer the advantage of being able to serve the town with TGV services travelling further south, but Mont√©limar is currently served by various TGV services leaving the high-speed line just before Valence TGV station. * Aix-en-Provence wanted its TGV station more eastwards, closer to the town centre.

A member of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois (BQ), she previously served as the MP for Beauharnois‚ÄîSalaberry from 2006 to 2011. Born in Salaberry-de- Valleyfield, Quebec, DeBellefeuille was a social worker before becoming a politician. She was first elected in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Beauharnois‚ÄîSalaberry. She defeated Alain Boire in the nomination race in the riding and went on to win the general election. DeBellefeuille was reelected in 2008 with a slightly higher margin than the previous election. Between June 2010 and May 2011, she replaced Michel Guimond as the chief Bloc Qu√©b√©cois Whip, previously serving as Deputy Whip. In the 2011 federal election, DeBellefeuille was a casualty of the Orange Wave, losing her seat to Anne Minh-Thu Quach of the New Democratic Party (NDP). In 2015, she ran in Salaberry‚ÄîSuro√Æt and was again defeated by Quach. In the 2019 federal election, DeBellefeuille was able to retake the seat, receiving nearly 30,000 votes.

Jagmeet Singh attempted to seek the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion recognizing that there is systemic racism within the RCMP, and calling on the government to take specific steps to address it. Bloc Quebecois MP Alain Therrien was the sole member of parliament who was denying consent on an otherwise unanimous vote. As is standard practice, House Speaker Anthony Rota asked the House for consent to hear the terms of the motion, and while most MPs concurred, Therrien said no, which, under Commons rules, was enough to prevent Singh from presenting it to the House.

The bettor can adjust the point spreads for the two games, but realizes a lower return on the bets in the event of a win. A teaser is a type of wager used in sports betting, most commonly in basketball and football. This wager is a multi-team wager, allowing the bettor to choose a minimum of two teams up to, in some cases, 15 teams. The bettor will get points on his favor to add or subtract to the teams chosen to improve the point spread chosen. There are two types of teasers. The first kind, known as a \\"Super Teaser,\\" \\"Special Teaser,\\" \\"Big Teaser,\\" or \\"Monster Teaser, \\" allows the bettor to choose three, four, or in some cases five teams, and gives a larger number of points to add or subtract to the spread of the selections chosen. In return, the bettor will receive less money than the one risked in the bet. The second type of teaser, known as a \\"Vegas Teaser,\\" or simply a \\"Teaser,\\" is more of a combination between a parlay and the first teaser explained. In this case, the bettor will receive fewer points to adjust the spread of the selections chosen, but the more teams chosen in the wager (from two to 15 in some cases), the higher the payout will be. Example Super Bowl XLV: Pittsburgh vs. Green Bay Green Bay Pittsburgh (+2.5) Over/under (45.5) Normally, if these bets are played together as a parlay, a bettor will win $260 on a $100 bet. However, with a teaser, the bettor will win $100 on a $110 bet, 10 to 11 odds. The reasoning is that one will get 6 points to adjust the spread (in either direction). If one bets on Pittsburgh, a +2.5 underdog, they are now +8.5 underdogs (+2.5 + 6). If one bets on Green Bay, a -2.5 favorite, they now become +3.5 underdogs (-2.5 + 6). Bet on the over and the line is 39.5 (45.5 - 6). Bet on the under and the line is 51.5 (45.5 + 6). Many bettors like the teaser bet because it gives the bettor more cushion, but like a parlay, one must hit all aspects of the bet to win. There is still debate among experienced sports bettors if teasers are good wagers or not. Opinions vary on the subject, with some believing they are poor option, while others believe they are worthwhile, especially as more games tend to fall close to the point spread. Many sportsbooks also offer teaser cards (similar to parlay cards). In most cases, teasers must involve 3 or more teams, and spreads and totals have half points to avoid ties. Cards are usually printed in the morning (Every Wednesday morning for football) and the lines on the cards are fixed, though the book reserves the right to take the games off the board.

Click Click formed in 1982 by Adrian Smith, and Derek E. Smith, after the end of their previous rock project Those Nervous Surgeons (which formed in 1976 with bassist Tim Wilson). When Wilson bought their first synthesizer, (an EDP Wasp), the direction of the group changed so dramatically, they renamed themselves. In 1982, the group acquired guitarist Richard Camp from Bikini Amber and thus the first experimental synth-rock incarnation of Click Click was born. They cut their first single later that year, but Camp departed over creative issues and formed a blues band. Influenced by artists such as Brian Eno, Cabaret Voltaire, The Residents and Frank Zappa, and of course Blade Runner, Clive Barker and \\"mind-expanding\\" substances, Click Click continued on with other revolving members down a more electronic path until their eventual break up around 1990. Other members included guitarist Jon Morris, who was replaced by Graham Stronach in 1987 and Pete Hosier who remained with the group until the end. After a seven year hiatus, Adrian and Derek Smith reformed briefly in 1997 to record Shadowblack on the OffBeat label. The album was more EBM than their earlier work and almost completely instrumental. It was greeted with overall positive reviews within the underground music scene. Due to the member's volatile relationship however, the band split again in 1998, with no plans for another reunion. A Click Click vinyl release was issued on NYC-based Sonic Groove Records in 2004, but it is most like that only Adrian was involved, but that is still unclear. Throughout the 2000s, Adrian has been involved with Paperhouse, a darker ambient soundtrack project. Nothing has been released publicly, aside from a few odd compilation appearances, but at least 4 CD-R releases are known to exist: Bug Sun, Sappho, Frey, and Sammlung. In addition, three Click Click CD-Rs surfaced offering odd unreleased and remixed material: Lung Function, Crushed, and Behind Dark Glasses. The summer of 2008 brought the news that Click Click's back catalogue would be available again, this time via various download platforms including iTunes. The material will come in remastered versions and will also include the early catalogue. Lung Function, a compilation of remastered singles, was released on iTunes, Amazon digital service and eMusic in 2008.

The LGV Sud Europe Atlantique (LGV SEA), also known as the LGV Sud-Ouest or LGV L'Oc√©ane, is a high-speed railway line between Tours and Bordeaux, in France. It is used by TGV trains operated by SNCF, the French national railway company. It is an extension of the LGV Atlantique. The line was inaugurated on 28 February 2017 and entered service on 2 July 2017. The line, which was at the time the biggest European railway construction project, was built by the LISEA consortium, which owns and maintains the line until 2061 and charges tolls to train companies. Trains on this line depart Paris at Gare Montparnasse.  Purpose  Project map (English/French) The LGV SEA brings high-speed rail service to southwestern France and connects the r√©gions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Occitanie with the high-speed rail service of Northern Europe, which connects Paris to London, Brussels, Amsterdam and beyond. The trip between Paris and Bordeaux takes around two hours and ten minutes at a top speed of 320 km/h. The inter-city links between Tours, Poitiers, Angoul√™me, and Bordeaux are also improved, and southwestern France is better connected to various parts of the country and to the rest of Europe. Trains on this line depart Paris at Gare Montparnasse The project is also a response to the heavy traffic on the existing rail line. Train tracks are most efficiently used when all trains circulate at the same speed and have identical stops. The large speed difference between the fast TGV trains, which circulated on the existing tracks at speeds up to 220 km/h, and the slower freight trains and TER (regional) trains, which shared the same track, caused the interval between these trains to increase greatly. This congested the tracks and prevented their most efficient usage. Dedicated tracks for the TGV therefore leave space on the existing tracks for many more freight and TER trains than just the number of removed TGV trains. New regional TER services became possible, and could ease services that are currently crowded. The increase in freight trains on the existing track would ease truck traffic on the roads in the r√©gions, as trains transport more and more goods, easing the impact on the environment as well. The project was also sold as benefiting the economy. The construction of Phase 1 created 10,000 construction jobs for five years. Jobs in the transport, commerce, and service sectors were created as well. Local businesses may their see competitiveness increase as their markets expand, and tourism to the region may increase as well. This route supplements ‚Äì and partly supersedes ‚Äì the classic Paris‚ÄìBordeaux railway line.  Details  The line was built by consortium LISEA consisting of (Vinci SA subsidiary) - 33.4%, Caisse des d√©p√¥ts et consignations - 25.4%, Meridiam - 22.0% and Ardian - 19.2%. The consortium will operate and maintain the line until 2061, and charges tolls to train companies. The consortium invested ‚Ç¨3.8 billion, French government, local authorities and the European Union paid ‚Ç¨3 billion and ‚Ç¨1 billion was contributed by (subsidiary of SNCF). Another ‚Ç¨1.2 billion was spent by SNCF R√©seau on the construction of interconnecting lines, control centres, capacity enhancements at Bordeaux and remodelling the track layout at Gare Montparnasse. The new high-speed route bypasses Libourne, shortening the total distance traveled compared to the existing route. No new train stations were built between Saint-Pierre-des-Corps and Bordeaux, and service to Ch√¢tellerault, Poitiers and Angoul√™me uses their existing train stations, which new connections link to the high-speed rails. South of Poitiers, a connection allows trains to access the old tracks towards La Rochelle. The journey between Tours and Bordeaux is shortened by around 50 minutes. 302 km of high-speed track was built together with a further 38 km of conventional tracks that connect to the LGV. The new line is expected to increase annual ridership by about five million travellers. = Phases = For financial reasons, the project was initially divided into three phases:  Phase 1: Angoul√™me‚ÄìBordeaux  *2001‚Äì2003: Pre-project studies and procedures *3 February 2005 ‚Äì 16 March 2005: Final public hearings *Start of 2012: Construction starts *31 July 2017: In service  Phase 2: Tours‚ÄìAngoul√™me  *2004‚Äì2006: Pre-project studies and procedures *2009: Preliminary works and land acquisition *Start of 2012: Main construction starts *2 July 2017: In service In that initial plan, Phase 2 had to be completed on a rapid schedule to cope with the increased in traffic expected after the opening of Phase 1.

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the 1976 Pacific hurricane season, Liza developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of the Mexican coast on September 25\\\\. Slowly intensifying, the system attained tropical storm strength the following day. In favorable conditions, Liza continued to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on September 28 after developing an eye. The hurricane peaked in intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale on September 30, with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of 948 mbar (hPa; 28.00 inHg). Liza weakened as it moved northward into the Gulf of California. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made its second landfall north of Los Mochis, Sinaloa with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), making it one of 13 storms to make landfall as major hurricanes in the basin. Inland, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dissipated on October 2\\\\. Prior to the arrival of Liza, residents along the Gulf of California coastline were evacuated, although some refused to leave their homes. Radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. Liza brought heavy rainfall to the area, which caused significant flash flooding. Following a dam burst by the El Cajoncito Creek along the outskirts of La Paz, hundreds of people were swept away by flood waters. In La Paz, the capital of the state, 412 people died and 20,000 were left homeless. Nearly one-third of the homes in the town were destroyed. Throughout the state, a variety of death tolls were reported, but officials estimated that 1,000 people had perished. In the states of Sinaloa and Sonora, Liza caused moderate damage and left 30,000 to 54,000 homeless, along with 155 more casualties. Along the Gulf of California, 108 people were presumed dead after 12 boats were lost. The remnants of the storm later affected the United States, bringing moderate rainfall In the aftermath of the storm, rescue workers spent days digging through mud to find victims of the hurricane until the search was disbanded on October 6\\\\. The government received criticism for the tragedy, citing that the dam that broke had been poorly built. Overall, at least 1,263 fatalities and $100 million (1976 USD) in damage are attributed to the hurricane, making it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record in the eastern Pacific, as well as one of the few Pacific hurricanes to kill more than 1,000 people. Meteorological history Hurricane Liza originated from a very large area of intense thunderstorms that developed about southwest of the Mexican coast on September 25\\\\. Later that day, satellite imagery indicated that the system had developed a cyclonic circulation. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on September 25, centered about east-northeast of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. The depression gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, and became Tropical Storm Liza at 1800 UTC on the following day. Thereafter, Liza turned to the north at and began to strengthen while moving through sea surface temperatures of . Within 48 hours of the storm's formation, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) reported winds of , and Liza intensified into a hurricane early on September 28. Around this time, the hurricane had developed an eye that was in diameter, though it was initially not visible on satellite imagery. Operationally, however, Liza was not upgraded to a hurricane until 18 hours later. During the afternoon hours of September 28, a Hurricane Hunters aircraft made its first flight into Liza, recording a minimum barometric pressure of 971 mbar (28.7 inHg); despite the low pressure, maximum sustained winds of just were reported. Hours later, a second flight into the hurricane revealed winds of and slightly lower pressures. Liza continued to intensify, attaining winds of by early September 29. Later that morning, the hurricane reached Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). By midday, Hurricane Hunters recorded a pressure of as the eye became visible on infrared satellite imagery, prompting the EPHC to upgrade Liza to a major hurricane, a Category 3 or higher on the SSHWS. Liza continued to rapidly intensify and attained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) late on September 29, making it a mid-level Category 4 hurricane. Though Liza encountered warm sea surface temperatures of , it did not strengthen further the following day. Late on September 30, Liza brushed the Baja California Peninsula, passing about east of Cabo San Lucas while still at peak intensity. Early on October 1, Liza entered the Gulf of California exactly east of La Paz, Baja California Sur. By 1300 UTC that day, Liza made landfall about north of Los Mochis, Sinaloa with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), still a Category 3 storm. Operationally, however, Hurricane Liza was estimated to have made landfall with winds of 100 mph (185 km/h) and gusts up to 150 mph (230 km/h). The storm continued quickly inland while weakening, dissipating the following day. The remnants of Hurricane Liza later entered the United States near El Paso, Texas. Preparations Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, many residents in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September 29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain. As the remnants of Liza moved across the western United States, National Weather Service posted flash flood watches for much of deserts of California, southern Utah, and a portion of Colorado. For the higher areas of Colorado, a snow watch was in effect. In addition, motorists were warned of very hazards driving conditions within of the border. Impact In all, Liza brought a total of $100 million in damage in Baja California Sur, which receives catastrophic flooding from hurricanes every 50 years or so. The hurricane was considered the worst natural disaster in the history of the peninsula, which at the time held 130,000 occupants. Furthermore, Liza was at that time considered the worst hurricane to affect the entire country in the 20th century. =Baja California Sur= Rainfall totals associated with Liza Hurricane Liza caused extensive damage and loss of life in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Although the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) suggests that Liza brought only light to moderate rains to the area, peaking at around , newspaper accounts claim that fell (more than a year's worth of rainfall) in some areas in a mere 3 hours. Moreover, was measured in El Triunfo and San Antonio, along the southern portion of the peninsula. In La Paz, Baja California, a storm surge of was reported. The El Cajoncito Creek along the extreme southeast portion of the state grew into a raging torrent. During night of October 1, waters burst a three-year-old and dike. A wall of water spilled over a small shanty town of 10,000, thousands of which lived in cardboard shacks. Some shacks were swept away from their initial location. The ensuing mudslide is regarded as the worst in the History of Mexico. Most of the deaths from the hurricane were due to the dam failure; streets also received flooding from the dam burst. Initially, government officials denied that the dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction as the source of the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated in the middle of the drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon. \\"Dozens\\" of people were also swept away into the Gulf of California when Hurricane Liza destroyed a sea wall, which, ironically, had been built to prevent flooding from such storms. Nine children got swept under mud. The highway that connected Baja California with California was also destroyed in many places, more than originally anticipated. In fact, there were holes in the asphalt pavement. Bridges up to long were twisted. Due to flooding, troops evacuated dozens of communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities throughout the state were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were swept into the gulf. Sixteen people died inside the remains of a building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos. South of La Paz, communications and telephone services were cut off to 13 smaller communities. A highway that extends as far south as Cabo San Lucas was blocked. Further north, a highway that links La Paz to places along the northern part of the peninsula such as Mexicali were badly damaged in four places. Offshore, officials reported that 75 boats including nine owned by Americans had sunk during the hurricane. Most notably, the ship Salvatierra 's cabin and most of its upper deck were ripped off while its hull rolled over. Multiple trucks smashed the ship; however, they were later salvaged. In addition, a vessel sunk during the storm, in which the owner had to pay for the damage, but later earned $50,000 settlement. Overall, several ports along the coast were destroyed by the storm. In La Paz, a town that at that time had a population of approximately 85,000, 20,000 were left homeless (nearly one third of the towns population), and an additional 4,000 were injured. It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city with mud filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud. Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters. Also, electrical lines and drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by the afternoon of October 1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38 sq mi (100 sq km) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead. Overall, nearly a third of the houses in La Paz were leveled. A wide variety of death tolls were reported by many different sources. Then-Mexico president Luis Echeverria as well as the HPC and EPHC claimed that 435 people died during the hurricane. It was initially stated that 630 people had died during the storm; however, this total does not include victims discovered by the Mexican army. During the afternoon of October 2, the local government had placed the confirmed death toll at 397. Two days later, the Bangor Daily News reported that the number of bodies found dead ranged from 400 to 750. By late October 3, Mexican officials and a Red Cross spokesperson reported that 650 bodies had been found. Meanwhile, a military search operation claimed that the death toll of the hurricane was 1,050. By October 6, local officials had abandoned efforts to retrieve additional bodies, citing safety reasons. Even though 650 people were confirmed to have died during Hurricane Liza, officials estimated that at least 1,000 people died. Within a week after Hurricane Liza, some feared 10,000 people perished. In addition, some modern estimates suggest that the toll could have been as high as 7,000. The Red Cross estimated that 75% of the deaths from the storm were children under 12. At first, most of the bodies found by the army were buried normally though due to the high death toll, some were just buried under debris. Some dead bodies were later burned to prevent disease. According to preliminary estimates by officials, 40,000 people were made homeless and an addition 20,000 were injured, 126 of which were considered significant. Within another day, the homeless total rose to 70,000. Total damage from the hurricane was estimated at $100 million (1976 USD). =Sinaloa= In the state of Sinaloa, heavy rainfall was recorded along the northern portion of the state near the Sonoran border. A peak total of was measured in both Hults and Choix. Upon making landfall in the state, Liza became one of six tropical system to making landfall in the state at tropical storm intensity during the 1968-1995 time frame. Offshore Topolobampo, 12 ship boats were reported missing, and the 108 crewman were feared dead. On the mainland, some damage was reported. Some flooding was recorded and at least 1,000 homes were evacuated. In Los Mochis alone, 4,000 people were left without a home. Damage in the city totaled $300,000. =Sonora= Across Sonora, many homes were wrecked due to flooding. Light rainfall up to was recorded along the southeastern region of the state which led to reports of damage. In Navojoa, heavy damage was reported. Numerous faculty homes, as well as the school barn and dining hall lost their homes at the College of Pacific. Damage totaled to $300,000. Along the southern portion of the state, in Yavaros, 155 people died, mostly adults. Roughly 80% of the town was flooded; it would take three years for the town to recover fully. About 30,000 people were left homeless statewide though other authorities estimated that 24,000 people were left homeless in both Sonora and Sinaloa combined. Throughout the mainland, 12 communities sustained heavy damage. In all, all, there are no reports of major damage in the mainland. =Southwestern United States= During its demise, Liza brought heavy rains and flooding to much of the Southwestern United States. In Arizona, the tropical system brought light to moderate rain throughout the state, with maximum being at Willow Beach, Arizona. Further east, Liza's remnants dropped light rainfall in New Mexico (peaking at in White Sands National Park), as well as in southwestern Texas. Across Death Valley, flooding was recorded. Aftermath During the aftermath of the storm, rescue workers searched the La Paz harbor, but had little hope in finding any victims. Other rescue workers endured heat while frantically searching for bodies floating on the ocean or sunk under mud. Six bulldozers worked all day and night to extract cars, some of which were upside down while others were submerged into the flood waters. Officials estimated that it would take eight days to repair down power lines in La Paz and completely restore electrical services; within 72 hours following the passage of Liza, there was no electricity or fresh water access to survivors. Emergency facilitates were used to provide the city with drinking water. Food was rationed at hotels and restaurants. Drinking water was supplied, but water supplies rapidly went short. Some survivors of Hurricane Liza complained that they had only received one ration of food and water within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October 3, after treating more than 5,000 persons, the effort had been halted due to a lack of sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October 2 in a nearby church. Supplies had been brought in through the air and via the Mexican navy containing food, blankets, and medicine early on October 2. However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in. Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obreg√≥n, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports. In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000 homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, who was then the U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October 2, containing food and construction materials. The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations. The government said that it was rushing in 100,000 meals as well as 40,000 temporary shelters the first of which started to arrive on October 5. within a week after the storm, however, one survivor of the storm noted that plenty of food had arrived from many places. Baja California Sur governor, Ceaser Mendoza Arambrue, ordered a permanent evacuation of all low- lying residents to prevent more destruction during future floods, saying \\"I never want to see this city menaced in this way again\\". He also believed that it would take two years to completely re-build La Paz. Mexican officials arranged a meeting on October 3 to make a plan to reconstruct the devastated area. The nation's president ordered a plan to prevent a recurrence of Hurricane Liza, saying that La Paz would be built a different way. In February 1977, houses were donated to the needy in La Paz. Many residents were upset at their government for failing to protect the dam. In the mainland, $50,000 of relief materials as well as $20,000 of cash was supplied to the Los Mochis area. Months after the hurricane, the Mexican government launched an investigation into the dam failure. In the end, La Paz recovered, though the town had to be almost entirely re-built. In 1997, Hurricane Pauline struck southern Mexico, becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the country since Liza. As of 2006, no hurricane in Baja California Sur has been as bad as Liza.

Studied as early as 1996, processes towards LGV Brittany-Pays de la Loire commenced during 2005 with initial land acquisitions. Following agreements over its financing, an invitation to tender was issued by French infrastructure manager R√©seau Ferr√© de France (RFF) during December 2008. On 18 January 2011, an RFF spokesperson announced that Eiffage had been selected as the preferred bidder for the project. After LGV Sud Europe Atlantique, it was only the second high-speed line to be developed through a public private partnership (PPP) arrangement. On 27 July 2012, construction of LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire officially commenced. The completed line was opened on 2 July 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron, it is operated by TGV services provided by the SNCF, France's national railway company.  History  =Background= Between 1996 and 2001, French infrastructure manager R√©seau Ferr√© de France (RFF) conducted preliminary studies into the potential construction of a 182 km extension of the LGV Atlantique's western branch, later known as LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire.\\"Brittany‚ÄìLoire Valley High-Speed Line.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 20 June 2018. During 2005, the process of acquiring land along the intended route was started. On 30 October 2007, it was announced that the proposed line had been granted a Declaration of Public Utility, a sign of formal recognition by the French government and a necessary step for any major publicly funded construction programme in France; at the time, this envisioned line had a reported cost of around ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and would achieve an estimated reduction in journey time of 37 minutes between the cities of Paris and Bretagne over the conventional route being used at that time.\\"LGV expansion plans firm up.\\" Railway Gazette, 13 December 2007.\\"Long-term TGV plans.\\" Railway Gazette, 2 June 2008. The proposal also become a recognised element of France's rail expansion strategy under the Grenelle Environnement initiative. On 29 July 2008, reports emerged that the broad financing for the line's construction had been agreed between the various bodies involved. Under this arrangement, the French Government was reportedly set to contribute ‚Ç¨990 million, which was to be matched by contributions from the regional government as well; the remaining ‚Ç¨1.02 billion was to be provided out of RFF's own resources. By this point, it was being reported that the envisioned high speed line had an increased projected total cost of ‚Ç¨3.4 billion, and that roughly 90 per cent of the land required for its construction had been already acquired. The proposed LGV Bretagne - Pays de la Loire was personally highlighted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy as one of four grand projects which were to be a recipient of funding under a national economic stimulus package that was issued by his government. During December 2008, an invitation to tender was issued for what was referred to as 'partnership contract' to construct LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire; the first round of bids were submitted by May 2009. On 19 June 2009, RFF President Hubert du Mesniland announced that, following an assessment of the competing bids submitted, a total of three groups had been short-listed: a consortium led by Bouygues TP, Eiffage, and a consortium led by Vinci Concessions. By this point, RFF had provided the three selected groups with further technical documentation on the project, while the completion of the full consultation documents was still pending. The final bids from the shortlisted firms were received in advance of 13 October 2009. On 18 January 2011, an RFF spokesperson announced that Eiffage had been selected as the preferred bidder for the project. Reportedly, it had won on the basis of five criteria: cost, the financing package's assessed robustness, technical quality and environmental impact of the proposed work, the timetable for construction activity, and the opportunities available to third party small and medium-sized companies. At the time, it was stated that Eiffage and RFF were expected to sign a contract to finalised this arrangement during the first quarter of 2011. On 28 July 2011, the 25-year public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP) contract, valued at ‚Ç¨3¬∑3 billion, which covered the construction and maintenance of LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire was signed in Paris by RFF President Hubert du Mesniland and Pierre Berger, the Managing Director of Eiffage. The arrangement covered not only the 182 km high speed line that would be newly built between Le Mans and Rennes, but also an additional 32 km of connecting track between the new line and the existing railway network. One day later, an associated funding agreement for the programme was signed by the Minister for Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development & Planning Jean-Louis Borloo. At this time, preliminary studies of the route were scheduled to take place between May 2011 and July 2012, while actual construction activity was intended to commence during the autumn of 2012. The line was projected to be completed sometime in late 2016. =Construction= On 27 July 2012, construction of LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire was officially commenced following a ceremony attended by RFF President Hubert du Mesnil and Eiffage Managing Director Pierre Berger, as well as other officials.\\"Work starts on LGV Bretagne.\\" Rail Gazette, 31 July 2012. Reportedly, it was expected that the construction phase of the project would generate around 10,000 jobs. Some elements of LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire's construction were contracted out to other companies as well. Italian transport engineering company Ansaldo STS provided the line's signalling infrastructure under a contract valued at ‚Ç¨62 million ($80.5 million) issued by Eiffage, while Indian metal fabricator Tata Steel was awarded a ‚Ç¨50 million ($65 million) contract for the supply of roughly 50,000 tonnes of rails for the project. An associated project, which was ultimately not realised, would have required the improvement of the conventional Rennes‚ÄìBrest and Rennes‚ÄìQuimper lines via alterations such as the elimination of level crossings and the straightening of sharp curves so that these sections could be facilitate trains moving at the higher speed of 220 km/h. If this option had been exercised, the journey time for Paris to Brest and Quimper would have reportedly dropped down to 3 hours. On 2 July 2017, the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire opened in a ceremony overseen by French President Emmanuel Macron.  Route  Construction site near Noyal-sur-Vilaine in 2014. The line begins as an extension of the LGV Atlantique western branch near Connerr√© (Sarthe). After a connection north of Le Mans, the LGV dips towards the southwest with a connection to the regular Le Mans-Angers line near Sabl√©-sur-Sarthe. The connection, at a length of 32 km, from Sabl√©-sur-Sarthe slightly speeds up the journey to Nantes. The line then rises to pass north of Laval and re-join the regular ligne at Cesson-S√©vign√©, near Rennes. The total length of the route is roughly 214 km of which 182 km being high speed. The high-speed line featured a total of seven covered trenches and ten viaducts. The track consisted of rails on top of concrete sleepers, which were laid on a bed of ballast; reportedly, a 900,000 tonnes of ballast, 820 km of rails and 680,000 sleepers were used during the line's construction. Overhead lines are provided for electric traction, the majority of trains running the line are intended to be powered in this manner. Electricity is supplied by the French electrical transmission company R√©seau de Transport d'√âlectricit√© (RTE) and is redistributed along the line via a series of substations, this electrical infrastructure reportedly allows for a maximum speed of 350 km/h to be achieved. The signalling system of the 182 km new high-speed line conforms with the requirements of European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) Level 2, while the 32 km of conventional connections are equipped with ERTMS Level 1-standard signalling instead. As such, LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire does not feature any conventional visual line-side signals, this information being communicated to drivers using in-cab screens instead. A combination of Radio Block Centres (RBC) and Eurobalises are installed at intervals throughout the length of the line to allow for the continuous delivery of this information to trains, which is wirelessly transmitted using the Global System for Mobile Communications ‚Äì Railway (GSM-R) communication standard. Under normal conditions, all of the line's signalling is centrally controlled via a switching centre located at Rennes. =Journey times= * Paris‚ÄìRennes: 1 hours 26 minutes (a reduction of 37 minutes) * Paris‚ÄìNantes: 1 hours 52 minutes (a reduction of 8 minutes) * Paris‚ÄìSaint-Malo: 2 hours 14 minutes (a reduction of 42 minutes) * Paris‚ÄìLorient: 2 hours 56 minutes (a reduction of 42 minutes) * Paris‚ÄìBrest: 3 hours 25 minutes (a reduction of 46 minutes)  External links  * LGV website  References  Bretagne-Pays de la Loire Category:Transport in Brittany ","title":"LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire"},{"id":"3642191","text":"Saint Gorgonius of Nicomedia was a Christian martyr, part of the group Gorgonius, Peter Cubicularius and Dorotheus, who died in 304 AD at Nicomedia during the persecution of Emperor Diocletian. According to Lactantius and Eusebius, Gorgonius held a high position in the household of the emperor. When the persecution began he was consequently among the first to be charged, and with his companions, Peter, Dorotheus and several others, brutally tortured to death. According to one version of the legend, Diocletian, wishing to expose Christians in his household, ordered everyone to pay honor to the Roman gods; if they refused, they would be exposed as Christians. The first to be exposed was Diocletian's butler, Peter, surnamed Cubicularius (\\"valet, chamberlain\\"), who was strung up, his flesh torn from his bones. Two Christians, Dorotheus, an imperial chamberlain, and Gorgonius, an army officer, protested this treatment, and were also martyred, together with another official, named Migdonius.

Some of the relics were translated to Minden.Sabine Baring-Gould, The lives of the saints (J. Hodges., 1875), 131. Many French churches obtained portions of the saint's body from Gorze, but in the chaos of the French Revolution, most of these relics were lost. The feast of Gorgonius and his companions is kept on March 12 by the Roman Catholic Church,\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) and on September 3 by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

All that is known of him is his name and that he was buried on a 9 September in the cemetery known as \\"Inter duas lauros\\" (between the two laurel trees) on the Via Labicana. Owing to the paucity of information about him, he was removed from the General Roman Calendar, when this was revised in 1969,\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 138 but not from the official list of saints of the Catholic Church, the Roman Martyrology.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ), p. 478 Epigram 24 of Pope Damasus I :Martyris hic tumulus magno sub vertice montis :Gorgonium retinet, servat qui altaria Christi. :hic, quicumque venit, sanctorum limina quaerat, :inveniet vicina in sede habitare beatos, :ad caelum pariter pietas quos vexit euntes.Damasi Epigrammata, Epigram 24 Translation: This martyr's tomb beneath a great hilltop holds Gorgonius, guardian of the altars of Christ.

BELEX, ) is a stock exchange based in Belgrade, Serbia. The Stock exchange was founded in 1894 in the Kingdom of Serbia, after the King proclaimed the Stock exchange law of 1886. Currently, the Belgrade Stock Exchange is a full member of Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) and an associate member of Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE). History The first ideas about establishing an institution which would control the movement of the value of money appeared in Serbia in the 1830s. The Serbian Trading Association, important for the development of the entire Serbian economy, initiated the passing of the Stock Exchange Law. The national Assembly adopted the Law on 3. November 1886, and the Law was proclaimed by the then King of Serbia Milan M. Obrenoviƒá. Several years later, on 21. November 1894, in \\"Graƒëanska kasina\\" the Belgrade Stock Exchange held its Founding Assembly and selected the management and exchange intermediaries. The purpose of founding the Exchange was to promote, facilitate and regulate trading in various commodities, all securities allowed to be quated, cheques and coupons, coins and paper money. The first trading sessions were held in the hotel \\"Bosna\\" on the bank of the river Sava, where exporters met and prepared contracts for food and prunes. At that time, only one trading session was held and in one room all transactions were concluded (currency, money, goods). As trading developed, two departments were founded: one for commodities, which stayed on the same side of the Sava as the Commodity Stock Exchange, and the department for currencies and receivables, the Currency Exchange, which started operation on the premises of the hotel \\"Srpska kruna\\". The Belgrade Stock Exchange was considered to be the best organized financial institution, was one of the oldest exchanges in Europe and the prices established on the Exchange were the referent prices for products on other European exchanges. In the beginning of the 20th century, various securities were listed on the Exchange. The most wanted and the most stable ones were government securities, which is quite understandable as people trusted the state more than public companies. The rule to observe was \\"if you want to eat well, invest in shares. But, if you want to sleep well, invest in government bonds\\". Between the two world wars, after a four-year break and in a difficult economic situation, the Exchange resumed its business. It prepared the regulatory framework and internal rules and regulations and consequently achieved new results. The development of the Exchange enabled the building of the Exchange own offices, as it needed modern working conditions, adequate premises, new technical possibilities, modern means of communication, laboratories, functioning of the Exchange court, etc. In 1934, the Exchange moved into the new building on the King's Square no. 13. The turnover increased, the business results were better, each day the Exchange was visited by 100‚Äì150 persons and the quotations were printed in 1000 copies, in three languages. This was the most intensive period until the great world crisis, which affected the Serbian economy as well. In the last days of the Exchange existence, Prime Minister of the Government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, university professor Milan Stojadinoviƒá, was appointed President of the Exchange. One of the last meetings of the Exchange board of directors was held on 28. March 1941. The Exchange lasted until 1953, when it was formally abolished by the Decision of the Presidium of the Serbian government. A number of famous traders, bankars and members of the Exchange disappeared during the war, or were convicted either as enemies of the regime or simply as unwanted persons. Thus the Exchange lost the people who had founded it and enabled its work. Many of them were deprived of their property and a large part of documentation and material from the old Exchange building was destroyed. With a change in the general climate and the beginning of the economic reforms, after adoption of the Law on the capital market in 1989, the Founding Assembly of the Yugoslav Capital Market, established by 32 biggest banks from the territory of former Yugoslavia, was held. In 1992, the Yugoslav Capital Market changed its name to the Belgrade Stock Exchange. In the 1990s, the trading material mostly consisted of debt instruments of companies, government bonds and the like. Although the first share trade was carried out in 1991 (companies Sintelon and Auto kuƒáa Kikinda), it was only in 2000 that a significant step forward was made, when shares from the previous privatization processes were included in secondary trading. In 1996, the Belgrade Stock Exchange traded in commodity-commercial notes of the Commodity Reserves with the underlying in corn, maize, sugar and oil, while the first municipal bonds were traded on the Exchange in 2000, as well as the first treasury notes of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. In 2001, the introduction of RS bonds for covering the government debt with respect to the old foreign currency savings further boosted the growth of the domestic capital market. Since its re- establishment, the operation of the Belgrade Stock Exchange has not been interrupted, not even during the NATO intervention in 1999. During 2003 and 2004, there were significant improvements in the development of the BELEX trading system, continuous and remote trading was introduced and international cooperation with other developed exchanges as well as with the exchanges from the region was enhanced. The first index of the Belgrade Stock Exchange was published in late 2004, and up to this day the Exchange has continued to develop other stock exchange indicators. In 2005, the Exchange focused on the improvement of the information process and launched its first information services for data distribution in real time. In 2006, the Exchange started to organize educational courses for the general public and improved its cooperation with issuers of securities, which in April 2007 led to the first security listing. On 22 February 2016, the Belgrade Stock Exchange, along with the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, decided to join SEE Link, and EBRD-sponsored regional network for trading securities. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is a member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges.

It is a grade I listed 1920s decorated chapel, designed by Lionel Godfrey Pearson. The chapel was built to accommodate a series of paintings by the English artist Stanley Spencer. It was commissioned by Mary and Louis Behrend (1881‚Äì1972) as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham who died at the end of the First World War. The chapel is surrounded by lawns and orchards, with views of Watership Down. It is now run by the National Trust and is open to the public.  Paintings  Spencer's series of 17 paintings was inspired by his own experiences during the First World War, in which he served as an orderly with the Royal Army Medical Corps, first at Beaufort War Hospital in Bristol, and then in Macedonia, where he was subsequently transferred to the infantry. He was influenced by Giotto‚Äôs Arena Chapel murals in Padua. He wanted to paint murals too, but the environmental conditions were not appropriate. The subsequent paintings were commissioned in 1923, with Spencer moving to Burghclere in 1926 to work in-situ. The series was completed in 1932. It is dominated by the Resurrection scene behind the altar, in which dozens of British soldiers lay the white wooden crosses that marked their graves at the feet of a distant Christ. The series chronicles Spencer's everyday experiences of the war rather than any scenes of action. When the art historian R. H. Wilenski saw the recently completed sequence, he wrote of his sense \\"that every one of the thousand memories recorded had been driven into the artist's consciousness like a sharp-pointed nail\\".Haycock (2009). A Crisis of Brilliance. p. 331.  Name  The Chapel is consecrated \\"The Oratory of All Saints\\" and only became officially recognised by its colloquial name Sandham Memorial Chapel following the National Trust's takeover of the property. Spencer would refer to it as his \\"Holy-Box\\", whilst the architect and patrons would privately refer to it as Spencer's \\"God-Box\\". Meanwhile, John and Mary Behrend's children pejoratively called it the \\"biscuit factory\\", in response to its \\"municipal\\" characteristics.Bromwell (2014). The God-Box of Burghclere, p. 58.

When the LGV Nord was planned, the residents of the city of Amiens in the Picardy region campaigned for the line to run through Amiens. SNCF decided instead to build the new high-speed line on a more direct route between Paris and Lille. The Picardy region is now served by the TGV Haute Picardie station, though this has been criticised for its lack of intermodal connections, summarised by the saying, la gare des betteraves (\\"station in a beetroot field\\").Analyse de l‚Äôimpact du TGV-Est sur les agglom√©rations de Metz,Nancy, √âpinal et Thionville, page 33, report on phase 2, I.S.I.S.

It is unclear how Amiens itself would be served, though the cheaper and more likely option would be to use existing infrastructure. Twenty minutes would be saved on the journey between Paris and Calais, thus making it possible to travel from London to Paris (Eurostar) in under two hours.

Aunt Lucy knows of a special talisman that may cure the illness, so she joins Franklin on a quest to find it, along with his friends Bear, Beaver, and Snail. But they are also accompanied by Aunt Lucy's goddaughter, Samantha \\"Sam\\", and her personality clashes with Franklin. The film was released direct-to-video in the United States, by HBO and has had occasional TV airings on Nick Jr. since then.

Plot The movie opens with black and white and a young female turtle with glasses burying a green box. The scene zooms out to a turtle shaped lake, then we see a picture of it as we hear a fire and someone shouting \\"Mother! Father!\\" before it then perishes on Granny Turtle, who wakes from a bad dream, and sighs sadly. The scene then pulls us to Franklin, Beaver and Snail playing pirates, and they were about to go to a tree with an X. Just as they were about head towards there, Bear appears playing the villainous captain and Franklin defeats him. After that, the four went home. Franklin and Snail walk by Franklin's Aunt Lucy's place and notice the door was open. They went inside to see if Aunt Lucy was home, but instead someone in a mask scares them off and they run away. As they run off, the someone in behind the mask reveals to be a female turtle with a pink bonnet on the head. two run, where Franklin's parents and sister Harriet get a message of Lucy, with no post or stamp. When Franklin revels what happened, Mr. Turtle soon gets the answers and they walk around the house, where Lucy appears to be. Lucy was at Granny Turtle's (hers and Mr. Turtle's mother) and promised to invite the turtles over. When Franklin tells her about the monster at her place, Lucy thinks it's her goddaughter. When the turtles arrive at Granny's place, who is happy to see them here, Lucy is in the backyard, with her goddaughter who reveals to be the turtle with pink bonnet, named Samantha (or \\"Sam\\"). The two aren't getting along very and despite trying to be to one and each other, their personality clashes keep getting the best of them. Later the next day, Bear, Beaver, and Snail wait for Franklin to play pirates again, when they see him with a bouquet of flowers. They decide to follow to see what's up. When they arrive, they meet Samantha, who thinks pirate games are for little kids, until Aunt Lucy appears as a pirate. As Sam is still not interested, Lucy decides to show her a map to shows real treasure: Granny's box of memories. Franklin and Sam decided to meet Granny to talk to her about the box. Granny flashes back to when she was just a child, revealing to be the turtle we had seen at the beginning of the film. She lived in Turtle Lake. She spend mornings of fishing with her father and she spend afternoons of picking berries with her mother. She found a secret hiding place and stayed there for hours and hours. Then, she buried her valuables inside a painted tin box in the ground to keep and remember, but she never got the chance to open it again. A few nights after she buried it, her parents let her sleep outside in a tent when a forest fire started and burned her tent and was about to damage her house. She manages to escape on the lake with a boat when the rain started. The next morning, her house was destroyed, the location of the time capsule was obscured, and the fire burned and her parents died. She went to live with her aunt's family and hadn't been back ever since. Interest by her past, Franklin and Samantha decided to check on memories from Mr. Turtle and Lucy's past. Later, the turtles get a call from Lucy that Granny is sick, and they decided to check up. Thinking that the box may be their only hope, Franklin, Sam, Lucy, Beaver, Bear, and Snail decide to head towards to Granny's old ruined home. During the adventure, Sam pulls a dirty trick by placing a rock in Beaver's backpack, causing her to slow down, until she founds out when she looks inside. She is not impressed and laughable at this joke. Suddenly, a flock of butterflies appears and they follow them, where they meet an old wise turtle, who gives an item, in which Granny also has it was imminently given back. Next day, they meet Little Crow, an orphan bird, who shows them the place with box use to be, revealing to be taken. Later, after placing flowers over Granny's house, they head out where Little Crow takes Snail to where three baby birds are. Meanwhile, Bear, Beaver and Lucy try look for the two turtles, who went to looking for Snail, and find an arrow Sam left for them to follow. While trying catch up get, Franklin and Sam's personality clashes happen again, until Little Crow, crying because the chicks wouldn't let him play with Snail (or \\"Pretty Shell\\" as he would call him), wanting to keep him to themselves. As they climb to reach to Snail, Samantha's hand slips, causing her to fall, but is saved by Franklin. They decided to rest rock that's safer not to fall. While waiting, the two turtles apologize for what they said and did to each other, admitting that their personality clashes had gotten the best of them. They soon reach the top and try to save snail, but chicks refuse to let them take Snail. Little Crow manages to save Snail, but gets into a fight with the chicks, causing him to throw Snail off the nest. Sam saves him but they all fall when the mother of the chicks appear and save them from falling to certain death. Lucy, Bear and Beaver arrive and help them all down. They decided to let Little Crow be with the mother hawk, as they set off. They soon arrive at a chasm, where they hear a voice, and help him out. The voice reveals to be Big Bear and he brings them to his home. Back at Granny's, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle made sure Granny's alive. When Mr. and Mrs. leave the room, Franklin put his face in the pillow and starts to cry. Harriet saw Franklin cry and comforts him. It later reveals that Big Bear dug Granny's box out when he was digging. They thank him and leave for home, with Big Bear giving them his canoe as shortcut. They soon see Little Crow flying with Mother hawk, and the wise old turtle. They make it back just in time. They give her the item, her dad's fishing hook, a picture of her house she drew and a sealed picture of her as an infant with her parents. She smiles as she finally recovers. Later that evening, the family has picnic and they enjoy rest of evening together. The two turtles and Harriet dance to Granny's song, and reveal it's back to school and they'll both miss each other, hoping to see each other again real soon.

Electroless plating, also known as chemical plating or autocatalytic plating, is a class of industrial chemical processes that create metal coatings on various materials by autocatalytic chemical reduction of metal cations in a liquid bath. This class is contrasted with electroplating processes, such as galvanization, where the reduction is achieved by an externally generated electric current. The main technical advantage of electroless plating is that it creates an even layer of metal regardless of the geometry of the surface‚Äîin contrast to electroplating, which suffers from uneven current density due to the effect of substrate shape on the electrical resistance of the bath. Moreover, electroless plating can be applied to non-conductive surfaces and parts of the object that cannot be connected to the current source. Electroless plating has many industrial applications, from merely decorative to the prevention of corrosion and wear. It can even be used to coat individual grains of powdered materials, with arbitrarily small size. It can also be used to create composite coatings, by suspending suitable powders in the bath. History The earliest electroless plating process can be considered to be Tollen's reaction, that deposited a uniform metallic silver layer on glass and other substrates. It was extensively used for silvering mirrors. The first electroless plating process to compete with electroplating was nickel-phosphorus, using nickel salts and hypophosphite as both a reducing agent and a source of phosphorus. The reaction had been discovered in 1844 by Charles Adolphe Wurtz, and had been patented in 1914 as a metal-plating method by Fran√ßois Auguste Roux of L'Aluminium Fran√ßais. However, Roux's invention did not seem to receive much commercial use. In 1946 the process was accidentally re-discovered by Abner Brenner and Grace E. Riddell of the National Bureau of Standards. They presented their discovery at the 1946 Convention of the American Electroplaters' Society (AES); a year later, at the same conference they proposed the term \\"electroless\\" for the process and described optimized bath formulations, that resulted in a patent. General process The general reaction of electroless plating is : + + Z where M represents the metal, the reducing agent, and Z its oxidized byproducts (which may be liquids, solids, or gases). In order for the metal to be deposited as a uniform solid coating on the intended surface, rather than a precipitate through the solution, the reaction must require a catalyst that is either the substrate itself or is applied to it beforehand. In fact, the reaction must be autocatalytic, so that it can continue after the substrate has been coated by the metal. Electroless nickel plating uses nickel salts as the metal cation source and either hypophosphite (or a borohydride-like compound) as the reducer. A byproduct of the reaction is elemental phosphorus (or boron) which is incorporated in the coating. Tollens' reagent is a classical exampleof electroless silver plating. For other metals like gold and copper, the reducing agent is typically a low- molecular-weight aldehydes.

She debuted on the stage as an assistant to her father in 1923, aged nine. By 1927, she was already performing solo. A major step forward in her career was when she assisted Alexander Vertinsky in his famous show at the Hermitage Restaurant, Montmartre.

It originally operated as a regional sports network for San Diego County, with a mixed format resembling that of Denver-based regional sports network Altitude Sports and Entertainment. After the loss of the network's television rights to many professional and collegiate sports teams in recent years, its programming has shifted more towards public interest programs as well as local programming, informercials and older television series that the channel had been carrying before losing the majority of its sports programming. History Cox Communications originally launched the channel on August 12, 1996 as KCOX; the outlet was developed as an experimental service intended to cover the 1996 Republican National Convention (which was held at the San Diego Convention Center), as well as to provide round-the-clock coverage for the Super Bowl festivities at Qualcomm Stadium in 1998 and 2003. Former logo as 4SD, used from 1996 to 2017. During the October 2007 wildfires that affected San Diego, 4SD carried ABC programs, including the network's news and primetime shows, in lieu of the market's ABC affiliate KGTV (channel 10) due to that station's breaking news coverage of the fires.PROGRAMMING NOTE: ABC Shows To Air On Cox Channel 4 ABC 10/KGTV Similarly on January 17, 2010, 4SD aired a college basketball game between the Connecticut Huskies and the Michigan Wolverines in place of CBS affiliate KFMB-TV (channel 8), which instead carried a local pregame show for the divisional playoff game between the New York Jets and the San Diego Chargers. Since 2012, 4SD has served as an alternate channel for Fox Sports San Diego for Cox and Time Warner Cable systems in San Diego County, carrying games from other teams that the regional sports network holds television rights in the event that live Padres telecasts on Fox Sports San Diego occur simultaneously as Los Angeles Clippers, Anaheim Ducks or Los Angeles Kings broadcast (which are simulcast from the latter channel's Los Angeles-based sister network Fox Sports Prime Ticket). Cox San Diego agreed to carry some games from the first season of the Fall Experimental Football League in October and November 2014. In March 2017, Cox Communications rebranded its local origination channels under the YurView banner (with The Cox Channel relaunching as YurView California), as part of a nationwide effort by Cox to bring all of their community access channels under a unified brand. Programming YurView California now serves as a locally originated entertainment channel, with many of its programs airing several times each week. Shows broadcast on the channel include Sam the Cooking Guy, BackBeat (a program about local musicians), California Life with Heather Dawson, Forefront and Cox California Edition. Although the channel still carries some sports programs (including Raceline and The Tim McCarver Show), 4SD no longer airs live sports events, with the possible exceptions of high school football and basketball.Cox Channel 4 Programs Retrieved March 25, 2013 =Sports programming= San Diego Padres In 1997, 4SD obtained partial broadcast rights to Major League Baseball games from the San Diego Padres; it aired the team's Monday through Saturday games, with Sunday games (which were produced by 4SD) being televised on independent station KUSI (channel 51). In 2001, the Padres and Cox Communications signed a 10-year extension for broadcast rights; as a result of the deal, 4SD built a state-of- the-art broadcast center located at Petco Park. KUSI lost rights to the Padres following the 2003 season, after having aired the team's games for most of the previous 17 seasons; beginning with the 2004 season, 4SD became the Padres' exclusive broadcaster of games that are not nationally televised (on ESPN, ESPN2, MLB Network or Fox); although games that are not aired on 4SD or any of Major League Baseball's national partners are not televised within the Padres designated market area. The majority of these non-televised games are usually mid-week daytime games, which air in time periods more subject to lower viewership. However beginning in August 2010, the Padres in conjunction with MLB Advanced Media partnered to stream the non-televised games for free within the Padres market via mlb.tv for games that did not fall within the blackout windows imposed by Fox (on Saturday afternoon) or ESPN (on Sunday nights). During the time that 4SD held the Padres broadcast rights, Cox Communications' Las Vegas system simulcast Padres games on \\"COX 96\\", a local origination channel on cable channel 96, which broadcast the team's games exclusively in standard definition (the remainder of \\"COX 96\\"'s consists of Las Vegas area government affairs and special event programming). On April 21, 2011, 4SD manager Dennis Morgigno announced during a meeting with his employees that 4SD will probably not renew the Padres television rights for the 2012 season onwards. This was later formally acknowledged by Cox Communications' vice president of cable affairs for the San Diego market, Sam Attisha, in an announcement that it would lay off the channel's baseball production staff at the end of the 2011 season. The decision not to renew rights resulted from a dispute during contract negotiations in which 4SD and the Padres differed on an annual payments for the rights to the team's games from 2012 onward by a margin of $6 million a year for the next contract. Fox Sports Net offered the Padres a 20-year contract with rights fees ranging from $17 million to $22 million a year (running between $340 and $440 million by the end of the term) with some reports of up to $70 million a year (amounting to $1.4 billion at the end of the 20-year term).Fox expected to swoop in after Padres leave Channel 4 North County Times April 28, 2011 Fox Sports won the contract, resulting in the creation of a new regional sports network to televise the games, Fox Sports San Diego.Channel 4 Probably Out of TV Picture The San Diego Union-Tribune April 22, 2011PADRES NOTES: Sources say Channel 4 out as TV partner North County Times April 21, 2011Channel 4SD to Lay Off Most of Baseball Staff; Employees Involved in Game Programming Laid Off North County Times August 21, 2011 San Diego Chargers Although YurView California never carried live Charger game telecasts, the channel formerly aired ancillary programming related to the NFL team including interview shows and Chargers game preview programs before their 2017 move to Los Angeles. San Diego State University Aztecs From the channel's 1996 inception until 2006, 4SD carried sports events from the Mountain West Conference, in partnership with regional sports network Sportswest. On September 1, 2006, the Mountain West Conference formed its own sports network, the MountainWest Sports Network (also known as \\"The Mtn.\\", which was shut down on June 1, 2012). However, as part of a distribution agreement between Cox Communications and the MountainWest Sports Network, 4SD was allowed to carry select San Diego State Aztecs sporting events that were produced by the MountainWest Sports Network as well as most of the MWC Basketball Tournament (which was produced by The Mtn. and CBS Sports Network), with the exception of the conference championship game (whose rights were held by Versus/NBC Sports Network (now NBCSN). The Mountain West broadcast rights were exclusive to the 4SD feed carried on Cox; the telecasts were not carried on Time Warner Cable as MountainWest Sports Network did not maintain a distribution deal with that provider. University of San Diego Toreros In 1998, 4SD obtained the broadcast rights to USD Toreros basketball home games that are not nationally televised (by either ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU or Fox Sports Net).

Carriage YurView California is currently only available on Cox cable. In addition to its carriage on Cox Communications, YurView California (at the time 4SD) was available on San Diego County's other major cable provider, Time Warner Cable (TWC). However it was not available until March 2009 when Time Warner Cable began carrying 4SD on its systems. In June 2010 Time Warner Cable began carrying the channel's high definition feed on its Desert Cities systems.New Start Over Channels in Desert Cities Time Warner Cable Desert Cities The channel was dropped from TWC lineups sometime in 2016. Games (but not the full lineup) were also made available to Cox subscribers in the Las Vegas Market. 4SD was never available on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network or to IPTV provider AT&T; U-verse. This is because YurView is distributed via fiber optic relays and its feed is not uplinked to satellite (similar to the distribution method of Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia). A controversial guideline imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as part of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (known as the \\"terrestrial exception\\"), which was implemented to encourage investments in local programming, stated that a television channel does not have to make its programming available to pay television providers that do not operate as cable services (such as satellite providers) if it does not use satellites for their transmission. On January 20, 2010, the FCC voted 4-1 to close the terrestrial loophole.FCC throws Cox a curve on Padres - AT&T; and other TV providers stand to gain access to Padres broadcasts as agency closes legal loophole The San Diego-Union Tribune January 21, 2010 The ruling, however, did not dictate a maximum amount that providers were allowed to charge providers to carry microwave- or fiber optic-distributed channels.

It is carried on Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable in San Diego County, and on channel 627 on Time Warner Cable's Desert Cities system. In 2004, 4SD began simulcasting Padres games in 1080i high definition. Between 2004 and 2006, 4SD broadcast approximately 120 games in high definition (however, road games outside the National League West Division, and interleague matchups outside of AL West teams were broadcast in standard definition, with the exception of a 2004 game featuring the Padres first-ever regular season road games against the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, which were both broadcast in high definition); all Padres game telecasts on 4SD aired in high definition beginning with the 2007 season.

The company was formed with the rail assets of SNCF in 1997. Afterwards, the trains were operated by the SNCF, the national railway company, but due to European Union Directive 91/440, the Government of France was required to separate train operations from the railway infrastructure. On 1 January 2015, RFF became SNCF R√©seau, the operational assets of SNCF became SNCF Mobilit√©s, and both groups were placed under the control of SNCF. Unlike other infrastructure managers, RFF did not provide maintenance services or rail traffic control operations, which were both done by SNCF Infra on RFF's behalf. Furthermore, SNCF retained the ownership of stations. In September 2013, RFF had over ‚Ç¨32 billion of debt. Overview The RFF was constituted with SNCF's infrastructure assets, and debts were transferred from SNCF's books to RFF's. RFF was mainly a financial structure focusing on debt refinancing, and contracted the majority of its infrastructure management to SNCF. Signalling on RFF infrastructure was implemented and maintained by SNCF. The creation of RFF was criticised because of the financial options chosen: RFF was subsidised by the French government in order to pay the interest on debt previously borne by the SNCF, which allowed SNCF to have a positive operating income and thus enabled competition to be opened. Control centres In July 2013, RFF began a project to build 16 regional control centres, replacing over a thousand local signalling centres. The first regional control centre was built in Pagny-sur- Moselle.http://www.sncf.com/ressources/presse_dossier_commande-centralisee- reseau-lorraine_08-04-2015.pdf See also * Autorit√© de R√©gulation des Activit√©s Ferroviaires * Gestionnaire d‚ÄôInfrastructure Unifi√© References External links * RFF official website * European Union SNCF brief * French Senate report on transport infrastructure * RFF network map France Category:Railway companies of France ","title":"R√©seau Ferr√© de France"},{"id":"3642480","text":"Martin Kober (also Chober, Cober, Coeber, Khober, Koeber, Koebner, ) (ca. 1550 ‚Äì before 1598) was a portrait painter and court painter to different Central European monarchs - King Stephen B√°thory, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Queen Anna Jagiellon and King Sigismund III Vasa, active mainly in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Life Portrait of Crown Princess Anna Maria Vasa, 1596 Kober was born in Wroc≈Çaw then known as Breslau, Silesia. Trained as a guild painter, he traveled through Germany for three years as a wandering journeyman to gain experience in different workshops. In 1583 he came to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth from Magdeburg and become court painter of King Stephen B√°thory and Queen Anna Jagiellon. He was appointed the royal servitor and at the court he met his wife Dorothea, also a painter specializing in painting crests. After the King's death he returned to Wroc≈Çaw, from where he joined the Imperial court of Rudolf II in Prague as a portrait painter, due to the conflict with other guild painters in the city. The emperor released him from the guild laws in 1587. After his return to Poland in 1590 he was employed by King Sigismund III Vasa and worked in Krak√≥w and Warsaw. He also traveled to Graz in 1595 to paint portraits of the family of Archduke Charles II for Queen Anne of Austria. Kober died in Krak√≥w or Warsaw. Work Portrait of Queen Anna of Poland - ca. 1590 Until the times of Martin Kober the portraiture in Poland was treated as not very important branch of painting by local artists. Kober was the first painter active in the Commonwealth specializing in the official portraiture and is therefore considered as the precursor of this genre in Poland. His portraits of the royal family influenced the royal iconography for the next hundred years and found its source in Spanish portraiture through artistic community in Prague. His earlier works at the court of Stephen B√°thory affected development of the Polish Sarmatian portrait. The artist works can be found in different museums across Europe including Orava Gallery in Doln√Ω Kub√≠n (Portrait of Daniel Kub√≠nyiho), Uffizi in Florence (Portrait of Stephen B√°thory), Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid (portraits of royal children), Bavarian State Picture Collection (portraits of royal children), Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Portrait of Sigismund III Vasa) and in Poland with several versions of portrait of widowed Anna Jagiellon, presumably an evidence of well organized workshop. The effigy, with Wawel Castle version considered as original, was painted flat. It is characterized by a strong realism and decorativeness. Versions in the National Museum in Warsaw and in the Museum of King Jan III's Palace at Wilan√≥w differ is details with absence or addition of certain parts.

The double-leaf bascule lift span stands approximately 70 feet above the water. At the time of its completion in 1917, the main span was the longest rolling-lift bascule span in the world. Vehicular traffic originally included streetcars, but streetcar service across the bridge ended in the 1930s. The bridge was formally renamed the Chief John Ross Bridge in 1950.

Finally Flaochad convinced Clovis II to hold a court near Autun and summon Willibad. The two Burgundian magnates met in a pitched battle and Willibad was killed. Flaochad only survived him eleven days, dying of a fever. According to Fredegar, who seems to have been personally interested in this event, the last which he recorded, both were the victims of divine judgement, for they had sworn friendship in holy places and had subsequently despoiled land to enrich themselves and made war on each other.Wallace-Hadrill, 93.

During and following the Vietnam war the pattern was adopted by several other Asian countries. It derives its name from its resemblance to a tiger's stripes and were simply called \\"tigers.\\" It features narrow stripes that look like brush-strokes of green and brown, and broader brush-strokes of black printed over a lighter shade of olive or khaki. The brush-strokes interlock rather than overlap, as in French Lizard pattern (TAP47) from which it apparently derives. There are many variations; R.D. Johnson counted at least 19 different versions in early drafts of Tiger Patterns, his definitive work on the subject, although it is unclear if these are all different print patterns, or if they include color variations of a few different print patterns. History Philippine Naval Special Operations Group operators during a training op. It is unclear who developed the first tigerstripe pattern, consisting of sixty-four (64) stripes. The French used a similar pattern (Lizard) in their war in Vietnam. After the French left Vietnam, the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps continued using the pattern, a variant of which was later adopted by Vietnamese Rangers (Bi·ªát ƒê·ªông Qu√¢n) and Special Forces (L·ª±c L∆∞·ª£ng ƒê·∫∑c Bi·ªát). When the United States began sending advisors to South Vietnam, USMAAG advisors attached to the ARVN were authorized to wear their Vietnamese unit's combat uniform with US insignia. Soon, many American special operations forces in the Vietnamese theater of operations wore the pattern, despite not always being attached to ARVN units: it became the visible trademark of Marine Corps Recon, Green Berets, LRRPs, SEALs, and other elite forces. Tigerstripe was never an official US-issue item. Personnel permitted to wear it at first had their camo fatigues custom-made by local tailors, ARVN uniforms being too small for most Americans; for this reason there were many variations of the basic tigerstripe pattern. In 1963, Marine Corps Advisors and from 1964, 5th Special Forces Group contracted with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian producers to make fatigues and other items such as boonie hats using tigerstripe fabric. Being manufactured by different producers in places like Thailand, Korea and in Japan via Okinawa, there was a wide variety of patterns and color shade variations. They were made in both Asian and US sizes. During the latter stages of the war, tigerstripe was gradually replaced in American reconnaissance units by the- then-new ERDL pattern, a predecessor of the woodland BDU pattern. The Special Forces-advised Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) used tigerstripes from 1963 until disbanded in 1971. Special Forces personnel wore tigerstripes when conducting operations with the CIDG. Besides American and ARVN forces, Australian and New Zealand military personnel used tigerstripe uniforms while on advisory duty with the ARVN units. Personnel from the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service were the principal wearers of tigerstripe uniforms (and ERDL uniforms) in theater, while regular Australian and New Zealand troops wore the standard-issue olive drab green uniforms. Outside of Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines have been the most prolific manufacturers of tiger stripe designs since the Vietnam War. The pattern became popular throughout the Middle East and South America as well. The pattern was tested by the USMC prior to the adoption of MARPAT through the Scout Sniper Instructor School.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the Connecticut River arising in the western hilltowns of Hampshire County, Massachusetts. It is notable for dropping in elevation, along with its West Branch, more than over .  History  Dozens of mills were built along the Mill River in the early to mid 19th century to take advantage of the available waterpower. To maintain sufficient summer water flow four reservoirs were built in the higher tributaries of the river. =Mill River Flood of 1874= In 1865, a group of mill owners from Williamsburg, Haydenville, Leeds, and Florence constructed a dam on the Mill River north of the town of Williamsburg, using a design drawn by one of the owners, a man with no engineering training. The dam was poorly constructed and leaked as soon as it was filled. On May 16, 1874, the dam failed catastrophically, killing 139 people in the towns to the south. The flood destroyed much of the villages of Williamsburg, Skinnerville, and Haydenville in the town of Williamsburg, and the village of Leeds in the town of Northampton. As high as the death toll was, it would have likely been much higher but for the actions of dam keeper George Cheney, who rode his horse at a gallop to Williamsburg to raise the alarm as the dam began to fail. Other riders took off from Williamsburg and were able to warn residents in towns to the south. Despite an inquest and the clear negligence of the mill owners, no one was punished in court for the disaster. Today, the former site of the Williamsburg Reservoir is accessible by a public hiking trail. This flood was widely covered in contemporaneous newspapers across the United States. =The Great Flood of 1936= In the two weeks that elapsed between March 9 and March 22, 1936, two record-breaking storms showered the eastern United States in heavy rainfall. From Virginia to Maine, towns and cities in river basins all along the east coast experienced extensive flooding. A survey undertaken by the United States Geographical Survey the following year estimated that between 150 and 200 people were killed as a result of the floods. The same report tallied material damages in the hundreds of thousands. The monumental nature of the 1936 flood, along with another massive flood in 1938, led to the decision to re-divert the Mill River away from downtown Northampton. Causes and Regional Impact The quantity of rainfall from the storms was described as among the greatest in concentration ever recorded in the country. In New England, the ground was still blanketed from the previous snowfall, and the warmer weather and heavy downpours melted the snow, significantly increasing the volume of floodwaters. Along the Connecticut River, communities were hit by two waves of surges. The first occurred when the Vernon Dam in Vermont gave out, sending an ‚Äúenormous wall of water‚Äù downstream, and prompting the evacuation of Sunderland, Massachusetts. A second occurred when ice jams along the river began to break apart. In Northampton, flooding of the Mill River was compounded by the flooding of the Connecticut River, whose waters allegedly backed up as far as the dam at Paradise Pond by Smith College. Local Impact On March 19, 1936, the Daily Hampshire Gazette reported that ‚ÄúNorthampton and environs faced the second serious flood within a week as heavy rains began today to swell the Connecticut river and its tributaries to menacing proportions.‚Äù The Mill River was reported to be rising a foot every hour while the Connecticut River flooded ‚Äúwide areas of the city and nearby towns.‚Äù Later that evening, the Mill River had broke past Old South Street, flooding the area around Maple Street and prompting state police to order the evacuation of hundreds of families. On Pleasant Street, floodwaters reached as far as the Plaza Theater at Hampton Avenue, a mere two blocks south of Main Street. Flooding and damage resulted in highway closures, the suspension of rail and bus service, and impacts to the sewer system, as well as gas and electric services. The Northampton-based Gazette, which reported extensively on the catastrophe, was forced to set up temporary offices at the neighboring Holyoke Transcript, publishing several editions on the Transcript‚Äôs presses. Impacts on public utilities and transportation raised concerns about water-borne diseases and other sanitation issues, as well as potential supply shortages. Commissioner of Public Safety Paul G. Kirk prepared for the possibility of food shortages and Mayor Charles L. Dunn issued a cautionary statement saying that persons engaged in ‚Äúfood profiteering‚Äù would be prosecuted. On March 21, the ‚Äò‚ÄôGazette‚Äô‚Äô reported that food supplies were being transported by boat through flooded areas. Following the evacuation of local residents, looting of flooded homes quickly became a problem. In response, Mayor Dunn deputized 50 citizens to protect houses in the Maple and Pleasant Street sections of town. The patrol was assigned 20 boats to accomplish the task, and only residents and persons with official business were permitted to be in the area. Response and Relief Efforts At the national level, President Roosevelt mobilized federal agencies and the American Red Cross to provide immediate aid to impacted areas. He also issued a blanket authorization for the use of WPA workers in flood zones. By March 20, 38,000 families from 11 states had been forced to flee their homes, and the Red Cross was seeking to raise three million dollars for the necessary relief fund. According to historian Joseph L. Arnold, ‚ÄúIn Massachusetts, where scores of large cities and small towns were pounded by water and huge chunks of ice, 56,000 people sought Red Cross aid.‚Äù The Hampshire County chapter of the American Red Cross was enlisted to raise $2,000 toward the three million dollar fund; however, it was soon after determined that the chapter would need ‚Äúat least three or four thousand dollars over the $2000 quota stipulated by the national Red Cross‚Ä¶ because of the acuteness of flood distress in this vicinity.‚Äù The flood created 3,000 refugees from Hatfield and the lower parts of Northampton. Along with the Red Cross of Hampshire, the American Legion and numerous other organizations and private individuals extended aid to people left homeless by the flood.

Art A graduate in Fine Arts from the University of Plymouth, Micallef's practice has been summarized as 'critical pop', exposing the darker side of our consumerist society and the human condition. His use of neutral colors and depictions of the human form delve beyond pop culture and bring to the surface many of the things that operate underneath the cultural construct. Aspects of Micallef's work examines our dichotomous relationship with consumerism, questioning how we can despise multi-national brands yet still allow ourselves to be seduced by them. He frequently uses the union of two opposites to make an intriguing chemistry. His painting style has been compared to Francis Bacon and is seen as an amalgamation of influences from the old masters such as Caravaggio and Vel√°zquez to more modern contemporary photographers and graphic artists. His depiction of the human body and mark making echo his teachings from John Virtue, a former student of Frank Auerbach. The rawness of expressionistic painterly marks work in stark contrast to the more graphic elements which surface throughout his work. In Raw Intent, a 2016 series of self-portraits, Micallef moved his focus away from social critique and more toward depicting emotion, saying, \\"This body of work I‚Äôm making now is really about being human.\\" From 18 June 2007 Sotheby's catalogue: In 2012, to accompany the AKA Peace Exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), Art Below showcased selected works from the AKA Peace series on the London Underground including Micallef's. \\"AKA Peace,\\" originally conceived by photographer Bran Symondson and now curated by artist Jake Chapman, was an exhibition of new works made for The Peace One Day Project 2012, bringing together a group of Contemporary Artists, all of whom agreed to transform a decommissioned AK-47 assault rifle, refashioning it into works of art. = Penguin Books cover = In 2017, Micallef had his work selected for the cover of Penguin Books' edition of The Outsider by Albert Camus. = Social media = Micallef embraces social media and its ability to showcase his artwork to the masses, but he is also highly critical of the highly curated version of life portrayed on most social platforms.  Controversy  London Underground had commissioned Micallef for a piece of artwork to depict one of the stations of the cross however in the last minute became subject to censorship for the use of the tagline 'kill your idol' found in the artwork. \\"To my dismay I found out at the last minute the London Underground have decided to pull the piece from the show apparently because of the title ‚ÄòKill your idol‚Äô in the middle of the panel in the painting.\\" Micallef's most recent controversial piece is the political satire of Donald Trump using cigarette packets as his canvas, rendering the at that time Republican nominee on the front of a cigarette packet bearing the now familiar \\"Smoking kills\\" tagline. Micallef intends to highlight the threat that Trump poses to society. As he explains, \\"I thought a warning sign of the imminent danger of a narcissistic sociopath fitted aptly into the concept.\\" having been displayed as part of the group show the controversial 'Why I Want To Fuck Donald Trump' exhibition at New York's Joshua Liner Gallery in 2016. Micallef's Trump pieces were used for both the protest marches In L.A and In Washington D.C for the Women's March after the inauguration of the 45th President. The image had also been used for a Placebo concert in Mexico in 2017, again in protest at the new president. Also, a fake news story image of the 43rd President George Bush painting the image had gone viral and used in the publication of The Big Issue.  Critical Reception  Paul Moorhouse the Head of Collection Displays (Victorian to Contemporary) and Senior Curator 20th Century Collections at the national portrait gallery essay 'The Brutality of Appearance: Antony Micallef‚Äôs Self-Portraits' , explores the physicality, the fleshliness and violence of Micallef's work, \\"While maintaining an illusionistic intimation of space and background, his portraits present a figure as if it has been subjected to an intense trauma\\" all the while contextulising him within the canon of art history and the painted portrait. In 2011 a piece by Andrew Perry for Telegraph said \\"Antony Micallef‚Äôs riotous paintings are a gleeful attack on consumerism.\\" Also calling Antony \\"one of Britain‚Äôs most electrifying young painters\\". In a piece by editor Dylan Jones of GQ magazine in 2015 Antony is hailed to \\"change the face of modern portraiture\\". the piece describes Antony and his work as raw and painterly giving particular praise to the honesty of his portraits and the connection between him and the painter Frank Auerbach stating, \\"Surely if there is a man to whom Auerbach should pass his torch then it is Micallef\\".

Early Life  George Charles Grey was the son of Major-General Wulff Henry Grey CB, CMG of the Royal Engineers and Alix Grey. His education took in Durnford School at Langton Matravers, Winchester College and, following a year at Berlin University, to Hertford College, Oxford.  Politics  From the 1931 election, when Grey braved public opinion at his private school by flaunting the Liberal colours, he was a devoted and unswervingly faithful adherent of the Liberal Party.The Times obit 1944 He stood unopposed in a by-election triggered by Sir Hugh Michael Seely being elevated to the peerage. He was sworn in at the House of Commons on 9 September 1941. Grey made his maiden speech there on 17 December 1941 in a debate on 'service pay and dependants' allowances'. He closed his speech with these words - Between his election and his death, he was the youngest member of the House of Commons, having been elected at the age of 22. Not only was he youngest member of that Parliament, he was the youngest MP of the 20th Century. Following the death of Grey when he was killed in action with his regiment in France, William Beveridge retained Berwick for the Liberals in the subsequent by-election. His death was noted by the House when Speaker of the Commons, Douglas Clifton Brown informed the Members. His words were recorded in Hansard -  Military career  In 1938, Grey joined the Grenadier Guards Supplementary Reserve of Officers. He served with the regiment during the Battle of France and participated in the Dunkirk Evacuation. A captain in the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards, he was participating in Operation Bluecoat when he was killed by a sniper as his tank was hit advancing through Lutain Wood. He was buried on the battlefield by his men, on the site of which his family later erected a memorial. The residents of Le Repas and Captain Grey's family were 'emphatic in their desire' for the grave to remain in place. The stone for the cross came from the Houses of Parliament in London. The site is now recognised as a war grave, designated the Livry (Le Repas) Isolated Grave. A memorial service was held at St. Margaret's, Westminster on 27 September 1944.

Biography She was born in Bamako in what was then French Sudan. Her father, Karamogo K√©ita, was from Guinea, fought in World War I and was a member of the colonial hygiene service. Her mother, Miriam Coulibaly, was from Ivory Coast. In 1923, her father sent Aoua to the first girls' school in Bamako, over the opposition of her mother. In 1928, she graduated from Bamako's foyer des m√©tisses, a boarding school primarily for mixed-race girls to which a few Africans were allowed to enroll. Three years later, she completed her studies at the √âcole de M√©decine de Dakar and became a midwife. She went to work for the colonial government, being posted to Gao for 12 years. In 1935, she married a doctor, Daouda Diawara, who aroused her interest in politics. They joined the political party Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain (African Democratic Assembly; RDA) upon its founding in 1946. That year, she assisted at the birth of Alpha Oumar Konar√©, a future two-term President of Mali, at Kayes. K√©ita and Diawara divorced in 1949 under pressure from Diawara's mother, when it became clear that K√©ita could not have children. She was punished for her anti-colonial activism by being assigned to more and more remote locations, including Gao in 1950 and Nara in the mid-1950s. In 1951, she renounced her French citizenship and campaigned for the RDA in the 1951 French election, the party winning three parliamentary seats. As the RDA gained power, she rose through its ranks. In September 1958, she was elected to the RDA's executive body, the Bureau Politique National. In 1959, she was elected to Parliament, representing Sikasso. She was also appointed to the committee charged with drafting the constitution of the Sudanese Republic (an early name for Mali). Mali gained its independence in 1960. That year, she was the only woman elected to the new National Assembly and the only woman within the party leadership. She also served as secretary-general of the Commission Sociale des Femmes upon its establishment in 1962. In the 1960s, however, she was pushed out of power in the increasingly radicalised RDA by a longtime rival, Mariam Ke√Øta, the senior wife of the first President of Mali, Modibo Ke√Øta. In 1966, she gave up her midwife duties. When Modibo Ke√Øta was overthrown in a 1968 coup d'√©tat, she left the country. In the 1970s, she and her second husband, Djim√© Diallo, lived in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. She published her autobiography in 1975; Femme d‚ÄôAfrique. La vie d‚ÄôAoua K√©ita racont√©e par elle- m√™me recounted her life up to the 1950s. When conditions improved in Mali and deteriorated in the Congo, they moved to Bamako in 1979, where she died the following year. She received numerous awards and honours from several African nations.

It caters to highly gifted students from across the city. It is located within the campus of the City College of New York (CCNY). Created in 2002 along with Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, and High School of American Studies at Lehman College, HSMSE was founded with an emphasis on engineering and design, and was envisioned as a small school with approximately four hundred students. The relatively small population of the school allows students and teachers to have a stronger relationship. Being a specialized high school not only draws students in, but also allows for a diverse student body. Facilities and curriculum Eastern doors of the Baskerville Hall on the campus of the City College of New York, and HSMSE HSMSE is a highly selective, public, college prep high school, and is one of nine specialized high schools in New York City. Admission is via the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. The school's mission is \\"to challenge talented students to expand their intellect by developing the habits of inquiry, written and verbal expression, and critical thinking.\\" Instructionally supported by the City College of New York, the school mainly focuses on an intensive STEM curriculum, while also emphasizing civic responsibility and the value of knowledge. Located on the campus of City College, which stretches from West 133rd Street to West 141st Street along Convent Avenue, HSMSE is small, with a total of approximately 485 students in ninth to twelfth grade. The school is located on four floors of the CCNY campus' Baskerville Hall. Students eat lunch in the CCNY cafeteria and utilize the college library and gymnasium. Classrooms and labs on the first and second floors of Baskerville were completely renovated in 2010 and Smart Boards and computers are available in most classrooms. The school has an extended day schedule and 85 minute periods with classes on alternating days, enabling a greater degree of focus and depth than the usual high school schedule. Class sizes are small, with an average of approximately 24 students per class. In addition to a rigorous core subject program emphasizing math, science and the humanities, all students are required to take a minimum of three engineering core courses through 11th grade sponsored by Project Lead the Way. After 10th grade most students take a concentration of engineering or mathematics courses while a smaller group participates in a biomedical research program at Mt. Sinai Hospital. =German program= German is the core language taught at HSMSE, which has one of the largest high school German programs in the United States. HSMSE‚Äôs founders believed that German is the language of engineering. As a result, about 75% of HSMSE students study German, which is offered through the Advanced Placement level, and many of them continue to study German in college. The school employs two full-time German teachers and is one of nine US partner schools of the PASCH program of the Goethe Institut through its \\"Schools: Partners for the Future\\" program. Every summer, HSMSE sends a few students on funded study trips to Germany with the Goethe Institute and the American Association of Teachers of German. However, the school also offers advanced Spanish for students who pass the Second Language Proficiency (SLP) exam in Spanish in middle school. Those students begin Spanish at the second-year level. =Electives= Students at HSMSE have one 45 minute elective period each day. All 9th graders take a Study Skills course (referred to as \\"Freshman Academy\\") as their elective first semester, and \\"Freshman Research\\" their second semester. The electives offerings change from semester to semester and year to year. For 2018/19 they included: MOUS 1, Classical Guitar, Art, Student Government/Leadership, Gastronomy, Dance, Honor Society Peer Tutor, Advanced Topics in Chemistry, Conversational Spanish, Thinking Games, AP Music, REVIT, Art History, Fantasy Literature, and American Protest Literature. =Extracurriculars and sports= Students participate in extracurricular activities such as Dance Team, Cheerleading, Eat NYC, Spades Club, Model UN, Euro Challenge, Fed Challenge, Key Club, MSA (Muslim Student Association), Junior Statesmen of America (JSA), Dr. Dragon school magazine, Harlem Is, The National Society of Black Engineers, Robotics, Photography Club, Gay-Straight Alliance, Ping Pong Club and Film. Students regularly compete in the American Mathematics Competitions, American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and NYC Math Competition, and submit research to the New York City Science and Engineering Fair and national scientific research competitions. PSAL sports teams include boys' basketball, soccer, baseball, volleyball, girls' basketball, softball and soccer, and co-ed cross-country and track. The cross-country and track programs are the school's largest teams, and include a significant fraction of the student body. Student events occur throughout the year, such as Club Fair, Student Leadership Conference, Talent Show, Spring Fair and Multicultural Night. There is also an annual election held for Student Government with two representatives from each grade, along with a Secretary and Treasurer. =Transportation= The New York City Subway's 137th Street-City College (), 135th Street (), and 145th Street () stations are located nearby. Additionally, New York City Bus's routes stop near HSMSE. Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare or half-fare student MetroCards for public transportation. Student life HSMSE has a diverse student body - in 2013 it was estimated to be the most diverse in New York City with 130 Asians, 75 blacks, 99 Hispanics and 101 whites. HSMSE is a school where students of all ethnic and economic backgrounds mingle comfortably. The faculty is notably dedicated, many devoting personal time to mentor students, to coach teams and to support extracurricular activities. Support mechanisms are in place for students who struggle, through informal peer tutoring as well as through daily tutoring sessions offered by every teacher. Virtually all of HSMSE‚Äôs diverse, high- achieving students go on to college, many of them to highly competitive colleges. Most courses are taught at the advanced and college level and, by graduation, all students will have completed a significant number of college level courses with credit granted by CCNY as well as Advanced Placement courses. All students in the graduating classes beginning in 2013 will complete at least two Advanced Placement courses, as HSMSE teaches AP English Literature as the standard 11th grade English course and AP World History as the 9th and 10th grade social studies course. The school also offers AP Statistics, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Computer Science AB, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science, AP Physics, and AP German. Students may take advantage of additional undergraduate courses offered through the CUNY College Now program. Rankings HSMSE was ranked the city's third best public high school in The New York Posts annual school ranking. In 2013, HSMSE was ranked among the nation's top high schools by the U.S. News & World Report, and in 2017, the U.S. News & World Report ranked HSMSE as third in New York State and 26th nationally. In May 2013, HSMSE was ranked #1 in the country by Working in Support of Education (w!se) for personal finance education.

(2002). Ulmaceae, in Wu, Z. & Raven, P. (eds) Flora of China, Vol. 5 (Ulmaceae through Basellaceae). Science Press, Beijing, and Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis, US. It is also known as the Asiatic elm and dwarf elm, but sometimes miscalled the 'Chinese Elm' (Ulmus parvifolia). It is the last tree species encountered in the semi-desert regions of central Asia. Described by Pallas in the 18th century from specimens from Transbaikal, Ulmus pumila has been widely cultivated throughout Asia, North America, Argentina, and southern Europe, becoming naturalized in many places, notably across much of the United States.  Description  The Siberian elm is usually a small to medium-sized, often bushy, deciduous tree growing to 25 m tall, the d.b.h. to 1 m; the bark is dark gray, irregularly longitudinally fissured. The branchlets are yellowish gray, glabrous or pubescent, unwinged and without a corky layer, with scattered lenticels. The winter buds dark brown to red-brown, globose to ovoid. The petiole is 4-10 mm, pubescent, the leaf blade elliptic-ovate to elliptic-lanceolate, 2-8 √ó 1.2-3.5 cm, the colour changing from dark green to yellow in autumn. The perfect, apetalous wind-pollinated flowers bloom for one week in early spring, before the leaves emerge, in tight fascicles (bundles) on last year's branchlets. However, flowers emerging in early February are often damaged by frost, consequently the species was dropped from the Dutch elm breeding programme.Went, J. (1954). The Dutch Elm Disease ‚Äì Summary of fifteen years' hybridization and selection work (1937‚Äì1952). European Journal of Plant Pathology. 02(1954); 60(2): 109‚Äì1276. Each flower is about 3 mm across and has a green calyx with 4-5 lobes, 4-8 stamens with brownish-red anthers, and a green pistil with a two-lobed style. Unlike most elms, the Siberian elm is able to self-pollinate successfully. The wind-dispersed samarae are whitish tan, orbicular to rarely broadly obovate or elliptical, 1-2 √ó 1-1.5 cm, glabrous except for pubescence on stigmatic surface; the stalk 1-2 mm, the perianth persistent. The seed is at centre of the samara or occasionally slightly toward apex but not reaching the apical notch. Flowering and fruiting occur March to May. Ploidy: 2n = 28. The tree also suckers readily from its roots.Grbiƒá, M., Skoƒçajiƒá, D., ƒêukiƒá, M., ƒêunisijeviƒá- Bojoviƒá, D., Markoviƒá, M. (2015).

The tree is short-lived in temperate climates, rarely reaching more than 60 years of age, but in its native environment may live to between 100 and 150 years. A giant specimen, 45 km southeast of Khanbogt in the south Gobi, with a girth of 5.55 m in 2009, may exceed 250 years (based on average annual ring widths of other U. pumila in the area).

Moreover, it is highly susceptible to damage from many insects and parasites, including the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola, the Asian 'zigzag' sawfly Aproceros leucopoda, Elm Yellows, powdery mildew, cankers, aphids, leaf spot and, in the Netherlands, coral spot fungus Nectria cinnabarina. However, U. pumila is the most resistant of all the elms to verticillium wilt.  Cultivation and uses  U. pumila was introduced into Spain as an ornamental, probably during the reign of Philip II (1556‚Äì98), and from the 1930s into Italy. In these countries it has naturally hybridized with the Field Elm U. minor (see below). In Italy it was widely used in viniculture, notably in the Po valley, to support the grape vines until the 1950s, when the demands of mechanization made it unsuitable. Three specimens were supplied by the Sp√§th nursery of Berlin to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. pumila,U. pumila herbarium leaf-specimens, RBGE 1902: elmer.rbge.org in addition to specimens of the narrow-leaved U. pumila cultivar 'Pinnato-ramosa' (see 'Cultivars' below). One was planted in RBGE; the two not planted in the Garden may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city. Kew Gardens obtained specimens of U. pumila from the Arnold Arboretum in 1908 and, as U. pekinensis, via the Veitch Nurseries in 1910 from William Purdom in northern China.Elwes and Henry (1913), p.1927 A specimen obtained from Sp√§th and planted in 1914 stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,rystonhall.co.uk/ in the early 20th century. The popularity of U. pumila in the Great Britain has been almost exclusively as a bonsai subject, and mature trees are largely restricted to arboreta. U. pumila is said to have been introduced to the United States in 1905 by Prof. J. G. Jack, and later by Meyer, though 'Siberian elm' appears in some 19th-century US nursery catalogues.Hovey & Co., Boston, Mass., Catalogue of ornamental trees & shrubs, evergreens and climbing plants, 1855, p.5 The tree was cultivated at the USDA Experimental Station at Mandan, North Dakota, where it flourished.Klingaman, G. (1999). Plant of the Week: Siberian Elm. Extension News, University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture. It was consequently selected by the USDA for planting in shelter belts across the prairies in the aftermath of the Dustbowl disasters, where its rapid growth and tolerance for drought and cold initially made it a great success. However, the species later proved susceptible to numerous maladies. Attempts to find a more suitable cultivar were initiated in 1997 by the Plant Materials Center of the USDA, which established experimental plantations at Akron, Colorado, and Sidney, Nebraska. The study, no. 201041K, will conclude in 2020.

(2012). Germination performance of native and non-native Ulmus pumila populations. Neobiota 15, 53‚Äì68. 14 Dec. 2012. The species has a high sunlight requirement and is not shade-tolerant; with adequate light it exhibits rapid growth. The tree is also fairly intolerant of wet ground conditions, growing better on well-drained soils. While it is very resistant to drought and severe cold, and able to grow on poor soils, its short period of dormancy, flowering early in spring followed by continuous growth until the first frosts of autumn, renders it vulnerable to frost damage. As an ornamental U. pumila is a very poor tree, tending to be short-lived, with brittle wood and poor crown shape, but it has nevertheless enjoyed some popularity owing to its rapid growth and provision of shade. The Siberian Elm has been described as \\"one of the world's worst... ornamental trees that does not deserve to be planted anywhere\\". Yet in the US during the 1950s, the tree was also widely promoted as a fast-growing hedging substitute for privet, and as a consequence is now commonly found in nearly all states. =Food= The unripe seeds have long been eaten by the peoples of Manchuria, and during the Great Chinese Famine they also became one of the most important foodstuffs in the Harbin region. The leaves were also gathered, to the detriment of the trees, prompting a prohibition order by the authorities, which was largely ignored. The leaves eaten raw are not very palatable, but stewed and prepared with Kaoliang or Foxtail millet make a better tasting and more filling meal.Baranov, A. L. (1962). On the economic use of wild plants in N. E. China. Quarterly Journal of the Taiwan Museum, 15 (122), 1962, 107-115.  Invasiveness and spontaneous hybridization  In North America, Ulmus pumila has become an invasive species in much of the region from central Mexico northward across the eastern and central United States to Ontario, Canada.McIlvain, E. H. & Armstrong, C. G. (1965). Siberian Elm: A Tough New Invader of Grasslands. Weeds, Vol. 13, No. 3 (July 1965), pp 278 ‚Äì 279. Weed Science Society of America & Allen Press. It also hybridizes in the wild with the native U. rubra (Slippery Elm) in the central United States, prompting conservation concerns for the latter species.Elowsky, C. G., Jordon-Thaden, I.

In Europe it has spread widely in Spain, and hybridizes extensively there with the native field elm (U. minor),U. carpinifolia √ó U. pumila, Morton Arboretum, Illinois, cirrusimage.com contributing to conservation concerns for the latter species. Research is ongoing into the extent of hybridisation with U. minor in Italy. Ulmus pumila is often found in abundance along railroads and in abandoned lots and on disturbed ground. The gravel along railroad beds provides ideal conditions for its growth: well-drained, nutrient poor soil, and high light conditions; these beds provide corridors which facilitate its spread. Owing to its high sunlight requirements, it seldom invades mature forests, and is primarily a problem in cities and open areas,National Audubon Society (2002). Field Guide to North American Trees, Western Region, p. 419-420 as well as along transportation corridors. The species is now listed in Japan as an alien species recognized as established in Japan or found in the Japanese wild.  Varieties  Two varieties were traditionally recognized: var. pumila and var. arborea, the latter now treated as a cultivar, U. pumila 'Pinnato-ramosa'.  Cultivars  Valued for the high resistance of some clones to Dutch elm disease, over a dozen selections have been made to produce hardy ornamental cultivars, although several may no longer be in cultivation: Some authorities consider the cultivar 'Berardii' a form of Ulmus pumila.Kr√ºssmann, Gerd, Manual of Cultivated Broad-Leaved Trees & Shrubs (1984 vol. 3) For the 19th-century cultivar called 'Siberian elm' by Castle Nurseries, Nottingham, see 'Nottingham elm'.

Notable trees  Roerich describes a specimen discovered on his travels through Mongolia: :We are in the deserts of Mongolia. It was hot and dusty yesterday. From faraway thunder was approaching. Some of our friends became tired from climbing the stony holy hills of Shiret Obo. While already returning to the camp, we noticed in the distance a huge elm tree ‚Äì ‚Äòkaragatch‚Äô, - lonely, towering amidst the surrounding endless desert. The size of the tree, its somewhat familiar outlines attracted us into its shadow. Botanical considerations led us to believe that in the wide shade of the giant there might be some interesting herbs. Soon, all the co-workers gathered around the two mighty stems of the karagatch. The deep, deep shadow of the tree covered about 50 feet across. The powerful tree-stems were covered with fantastic burr growths. In the rich foliage, birds were singing and the beautiful branches were stretched out in all directions, as if wishing to give shelter to all pilgrims. :::::‚Äî de Roerich, G. (1931).

When \\"truth\\" launched its campaign in 1998, the teen smoking rate was 23%. In 2018, tobacco products were used by 7.2% of middle schoolers and 27.1% of high schoolers. In August 2014, \\"truth\\" launched \\"Finish It\\", a redesigned campaign encouraging youth to be the generation that ends smoking. History =Florida Tobacco Pilot Program= The \\"truth\\" campaign was a campaign developed by the Florida Tobacco Program, which ran from 1998 to 2003. Through their marketing campaign, the program set out to drive a wedge between the tobacco industry's advertising and a youth audience. The program not only assembled a team of advertising and public relations firms, but also collaborated with Floridian youth to develop a campaign that would effectively speak to their generation. Youth articulated their frustrations with the manipulative marketing tactics used by the tobacco industry, and described their ideal campaign as one that would give them facts and the truth about tobacco. From this emerged the concept of uniting youth in a movement against tobacco companies promoted through grassroots advocacy and a youth-driven advertising campaign. In March 1998, student delegates at a meeting sponsored by Florida's Office of Tobacco Control voted to change the theme of the campaign to \\"truth, a generation united against tobacco.\\" In April 1998, Florida launched a $25 million advertising campaign that included 33 television commercials, seven billboards, eight print ads and four posters. With a target audience of youth aged 12‚Äì17, the Florida \\"truth\\" campaign modeled their approach after commercial marketing to teens, and used messages that \\"attacked the [tobacco] industry and portrayed its executives as predatory, profit hungry, and manipulative.\\" The ads re-framed tobacco as an addictive drug promoted by the adult-establishment, and tobacco control as a hip, rebellious, youth-led movement. The grassroots effort of the campaign involved real teenagers taking on the tobacco industry as part of the 13-day \\"Truth Train\\" tour across the state. Despite positive results, reduced funding for the program, among other factors, ultimately led to the demise of Florida's \\"truth\\" campaign. =Truth Initiative \\"truth\\" campaign= As Florida's campaign diminished, Truth Initiative (originally the American Legacy Foundation), adopted Florida's successful strategy and converted \\"truth\\" into a national campaign. Generally consistent with Florida's campaign, Truth Initiative's version of \\"truth\\" featured hard-hitting messages highlighting the deceptive practices of tobacco companies, and stark facts about the deadly effects of tobacco. Campaign strategy and style \\"truth\\" strives to be a brand youth can identify with. In stark contrast to the heavy \\"life or death\\" tone adopted by many anti-tobacco campaigns, the strategy behind \\"truth\\" is to emphasize the facts about tobacco products and industry marketing practices, without preaching or talking down to its target audience. The resonating theme underlying \\"truth\\" is one of tobacco industry manipulation. With hard-hitting advertisements featuring youths confronting the tobacco industry, \\"truth\\" built a brand focused on empowering youth to construct positive, tobacco-free identities. Above all, the campaign avoids making directive statements telling youth not to smoke, and instead encourages them to make up their own minds about smoking and the tobacco industry. \\"truth\\" channels youths‚Äô rebellious nature and need to assert their independence towards tobacco control efforts. In addition to exposing industry marketing practices, many of the advertisements produced for \\"truth\\" focus on facts about the ingredients in cigarettes and the consequences of smoking, including addiction, disease, and death. A large portion of the facts and information exposed in \\"truth\\" advertisements were pulled from real tobacco industry documents that were made publicly accessible following the Master Settlement Agreement. The Truth Tobacco Documents Library, created in 2002 and managed by the University of California San Francisco, houses millions of formerly secret tobacco industry internal corporate documents. = Initial tactics and campaigns = The \\"truth\\" campaign's initial objective was to \\"change social norms and reduce youth smoking.\\" In building a strategy to accomplish this goal, \\"truth\\" campaign designers looked to marketing and social science research, evidence from other successful campaigns, and engaged in conversations with teen audiences. This research revealed that although youth were aware of the deadly nature of cigarettes, they were attracted to smoking as a tool for rebellion and empowerment. The \\"truth\\" campaign designers wanted to counter the appeal of cigarettes by encouraging teens to rebel against the duplicity and manipulation exhibited by tobacco companies. Since the launch of \\"truth\\" in 2000, the campaign asserts it has \\"utilized many different forms of media and evolved its tactics to ensure it reached the teen audience most effectively.\\" Arguably, the most recognized media produced for \\"truth\\" are its television advertisements. For example, the \\"truth\\" advertisement \\"1200\\" portrays a mass of youth walking up to a major tobacco company building, then suddenly collapsing as if dead while a single youth remains standing with a sign that reads, \\"Tobacco kills 1,200 people a day. Ever think about taking a day off?\\" In the \\"Body Bags\\" commercial, youths pile body bags on the sidewalk outside of Philip Morris's (now former) headquarters in New York City. One youth steps forward with a megaphone to shout up at the workers in the building, \\"do you know how many people tobacco kills every day? This is what 1200 people actually looks like.\\" Another \\"truth\\" advertisement, \\"Singing Cowboy\\", portrays a cowboy who has a breathing stoma (opening) in his neck singing, \\"you don't always die from tobacco, sometimes you just lose a lung\\", and other similar lyrics. A third commercial, \\"1 out of 3\\", uses \\"fantasized scenes such as an exploding soda can\\" to convey the message that tobacco is the only product that prematurely kills one out of three users. Perhaps one of truth's best-known campaigns, \\"Shards O' Glass\\", aired during Super Bowl XXXVII. The commercial showed an executive for a popsicle company, \\"Shards O' Glass\\", that provided disclaimers for their product ‚Äì a popsicle with shards of glass in it, clearly unsafe and deadly ‚Äì and posed the question, \\"What if all companies advertised like big tobacco?\\" Through social media feedback and focus group testing, \\"truth\\" designers learned teens respond best to \\"up-front and powerful messages that display courage and honesty in a forceful way.\\" With that in mind, other edgy \\"truth\\" advertisements with various themes were produced between 2000 and 2014, including \\"Connect truth\\", \\"The Sunny Side of truth\\", \\"Unsweetened truth\\", and \\"Ugly truth.\\" Prior to the launch of the Food and Drug Administration's \\"Real Cost\\" campaign in February 2014, \\"truth\\" was the only national youth tobacco prevention campaign not sponsored by the tobacco industry. = Campaign re- launch strategy and examples = In August 2014, \\"truth\\" launched the \\"Finish It\\" campaign targeting the next generation of U.S. youth aged 15 to 21. Along with a revamped campaign design, web presence, and series of ads, Finish It embraces a powerful new campaign theme: be the generation that ends smoking for good. In research with its target audience, campaign designers discovered today's teenagers are less interested in protesting against tobacco industry manipulation, and more interested in driving positive collective action. \\"Finish IT\\" was developed to suit this generation's desire to be agents of social change. The campaign aims to empower the 94 percent of teenage nonsmokers, and the 6 percent of teen smokers, to take an active role in ending the tobacco epidemic. The first campaign ad released, \\"Finishers\\", was shot in the style of a video manifesto and tells youth, \\"We have the power. We have the creativity. We will be the generation that ends smoking. Finish it.\\" The spot encouraged youth to get involved in the \\"Finish IT\\" movement by superimposing the campaign logo, an \\"X\\" in an orange square, onto their Facebook profile picture. This online activism tactic is similar to that used by the Human Rights Campaign when they asked individuals to change their profile pictures in support of marriage equality. In another series of \\"Finish IT\\" ads, \\"Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson\\" and \\"Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson Response\\", the campaign tries to shed light on the way smokers, especially celebrity smokers, give tobacco companies free marketing as \\"unpaid spokespeople\\" when their photos are posted. As a response, Finish It asked youth to \\"think before you post a smoking selfie.\\" The campaign also encouraged youth to \\"erase and replace\\" cigarettes from photos on social media with various props from the \\"truth\\" website. In 2015, \\"Left Swipe Dat,\\" a full-length song and music video created as part of the \\"Finish IT\\" campaign, debuted at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and connected smoking to dating. The video featured Becky G, Fifth Harmony, King Bach and other influencers. The lyrics revealed that you get half the matches on dating apps if you're smoking in your profile picture. \\"Left Swipe Dat\\" encouraged teens to lose the cigarettes so they could avoid being \\"left swiped,\\" aka, passed over on a dating app. In another effort to connect smoking to a teen passion point, \\"CATmageddon\\" showed teens that smoking is bad for pets and set up the scenario that if there were no cats (due to smoking-related illness and disease) there would be no cat videos and therefore there would be a \\"CATmageddon,\\" a \\"world devoid of furry kittens and the adorable, hilarious videos that come with them.\\" The ad launched at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards and featured partnerships with Petco, Adult Swim, and BuzzFeed. In 2017, the \\"truth\\" campaign showed how the tobacco industry has targeted African- Americans, low-income communities, LGBTQ individuals, members of the military as well as those with mental health conditions. The campaign encouraged young people to take note of the industry's advertising tactics while educating teens on the tobacco-related health disparities across these demographics. Initial documentary style videos created for this campaign featured comedian and actress Amanda Seales and premiered at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Later videos, premiered at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and featured journalists Kaj Larsen and Ryan Duffy, as well as rapper Logic. In 2018, \\"truth\\" launched anti-vaping campaign ads showing the dangers of vaping for the first time. = Grassroots tours = In addition to its television advertisements, \\"truth\\" maintains an online presence and employs guerrilla \\"on-the-street\\" marketing. Grassroots marketing is done via a team of \\"truth tour riders\\" who are sent to popular music and sporting events across the country every summer, including Warped Tour, Mayhem Festival and High School Nation. = Merchandise = \\"truth\\" also produces a line of custom merchandise every summer that is distributed at events. Each piece of merchandise features a design that corresponds with a fact about smoking. Items are often created in partnership with artists, such as a pair of custom sneakers made in collaboration with Kevin Lyons and Vans shoes. That partnership also spawned a contest called \\"Custom Culture\\" where students competed in design challenges relevant to the campaign's merchandise and subject matter. Evaluation and effectiveness Rigorous evaluation studies of \\"truth\\" have been published in the peer-reviewed literature since the launch of the campaign in 2000. To evaluate the effectiveness of \\"truth\\", Truth Initiative employs an internal Research and Evaluation team. Its efforts include evaluation of televised truth ads as well as digital, gaming and grassroots campaign components. Between 1999 and 2004, Truth Initiative (known at the time as the American Legacy Foundation) conducted a nationally representative Media Tracking Survey of youth aged 12‚Äì17 to inform its \\"truth\\" campaign evaluation. The Legacy Media Tracking Survey (LMTS) measured tobacco-related attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, exposure to smoking influences including \\"truth\\", sensation seeking, and openness to smoking. Cross-sectional studies on the effectiveness of the \\"truth\\" campaign provided convincing evidence that the campaign \\"had a significant impact on tobacco industry-related attitudes, beliefs, and other behavioral precursors, as well as a significant impact on youth smoking prevalence in the United States.\\" Exposure to \\"truth\\" was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonsmokers‚Äô intentions to smoke in the future. Another study of \\"truth\\" from 2000 to 2004 examined whether campaign awareness and receptivity differed for youth across socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2005, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health conducted by RTI International, Columbia University, and Truth Initiative used a pre/post quasi-experimental design to relate changes in national youth smoking prevalence to exposure to the \\"truth\\" campaign over time. The study's statistical analyses showed that smoking rates among youth in the U.S. declined at a faster rate after the launch of the \\"truth\\" campaign. A similar study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2009 found a direct association between youth exposure to \\"truth\\" messaging and a decreased risk of taking up smoking. A 2009 study examined whether the $324 million investment in the \\"truth\\" campaign could be justified by its effect on public health outcomes. Researchers found that the campaign was economically efficient because it saved between $1.9 and $5.4 billion in medical care costs to society between 2000-2002. In this way, the authors argue \\"truth\\" is a cost-effective public health intervention. A study evaluating the \\"Finish IT\\" campaign indicated lower intentions to smoke in the next year as well as anti-tobacco attitudes with higher ad awareness. Ad recall remained high, even when the campaign aired lower levels of television targeted rating points as compared with earlier \\"truth\\" advertising campaigns.  Awards and praise  The \\"truth\\" campaign has been praised by a number of leading federal and state public health officials, as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The campaign has also been recognized for its achievements in marketing with numerous awards in advertising efficacy, such as Emmy, Clio Healthcare, and Effie awards. \\"truth\\" has also been featured in a variety of academic marketing and communications textbooks to educate the next generation of public health and social marketing leaders. In 2014, Advertising Age named truth one of the top 10 ad campaigns on the 21st century. In 2016, the Monitoring the Future study, which surveys national samples of over 45,000 youth in grades 8, 10 and 12, reported historically low levels of current cigarette use amongst youth - only 6 percent of teens still smoke. Litigation A \\"truth\\" campaign radio ad called \\"Dog Walker\\" prompted Lorillard Tobacco Company to pursue litigation against Truth Initiative (then the American Legacy Foundation). The dispute ran from July 2001 until its resolution in July 2006. In the ad, an actor who identified himself as a dog walker placed a phone call to Lorillard, offering to sell Lorillard the urine from his dogs. The \\"truth\\" advertisement states urine and tobacco both contain urea. Initially, Lorillard accused the ad agency of violating the laws regarding the taping of telephone conversations and threatened to refer them to the criminal authorities. In October 2001, Lorillard filed a Motion for a Declaratory Ruling with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), asking the FCC to rule that the radio stations‚Äô broadcast of the ad violated an FCC regulation regarding broadcasting of telephone conversations. In November 2001, Lorillard notified Truth Initiative of their intent to litigate against the organization and its ad agency for defamation. Lorillard stated that it would not sue if the foundation agreed to a series of demands. Accordingly, Truth Initiative entered into discussions with Lorillard to attempt an out-of- court resolution. However, on January 18, 2002, Lorillard abandoned discussions and advanced a new claim that portions of the \\"truth\\" campaign violated the Master Settlement Agreement's prohibition against \\"vilification\\" or \\"personal attacks.\\" Cases were filed in both Delaware and North Carolina. The matter was resolved by the Delaware Supreme Court on July 17, 2006. They ruled unanimously that the \\"truth\\" campaign did not violate the Master Settlement Agreement.

Named after General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Savannah, the mall has expanded since its opening in 1969 to nearly one million square feet. Among its features are several restaurants, a food court, and 118 stores. It is anchored by Belk, J. C. Penney, and Macy's. The center also features junior anchors Barnes & Noble, Old Navy, and DSW. It is owned by Brookfield Properties Retail Group. History Center Court of Oglethorpe Mall, 1977. Oglethorpe Mall opened in April 1969 at 7804 Abercorn Street as Savannah's first shopping mall. The main anchors were Belk-Beery, McCrory, and Sears. At the time, the mall featured Savannah's first Chick Fil-A store. Other tenants included Morrison's Cafeteria (later Piccadilly, now closed), Adler's, and a Piggly Wiggly. By 1974, a expansion wing was added. Additional growth came in 1982 when a expansion wing was added off Center Court featuring J. C. Penney and Levy's of Savannah. In February 1986, Levy's was acquired by Maas Brothers of Tampa, Florida. In 1988 Maas Brothers was consolidated into Jordan Marsh, a major Federated Department Stores chain based in Florida and New England. Until 1989, the mall featured its original 1969 design elements. A significant renovation changed the feel of the mall altogether by featuring \\"coastal\\" design elements like whitewashed wood, tabby walls, and lighter paint choices. The mall is extensively lit during the day by natural lighting from skylights that were installed during the renovation. A new tile floor was installed, and would win design awards in 1990. A new two-level parking garage completed the project in the summer of 1990. Further consolidation saw the closure of Jordan Marsh in September 1991. In 1992, the Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh store was converted into general mall space, and a new Rich's was added to the mall. McCrory left the mall in 1994 and was replaced by Stein Mart the following year. A section of the mall known as The Promenade (a corridor decorated with neon lights and glass block, built in 1985 as a replacement for Adler's, which consisted of various stores and a restaurant) was replaced in 2000 with Barnes & Noble. A new food court was opened in 2002, and the Abercorn Street fa√ßade was extensively upgraded through the 2000s. Rich's was folded into Macy's in 2005. In March 2016, Piccadilly Cafeteria closed after 47 years of business, after originally operating as Morrison's up until 1998, when Piccadilly acquired the chain. The location was soon replaced with a DSW, which also took over the adjacent Lady Foot Locker and Manhattan stores. On 22 August 2018, Sears announced that it would be closing in November 2018 as part of a plan to close 46 stores nationwide. With the store closed, Belk is the only anchor original to the mall's 1969 opening. However, Seritage Growth properties, a Real Estate Investment Trust who purchased the Sears building along with 234 other properties from Sears Holdings in 2015, plans to replace Sears with an assortment of smaller retail spaces. Furthermore, in 2019, H&M; will open its third Savannah area store in an in-line portion of the mall. Additionally, in 2018, the mall received its first facelift since 2002. New interior and exterior mall signage, interior paint, ceilings, and tile floors were installed to update the appearance of the mall.

History Coroico Viejo (Old Coroico) was founded above the river Quri Wayq'u (Quechua quri gold, wayq'u valley,Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Biling√ºe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) hispanicized spellings Coriguayco, Kori Huayco). The town lived from mining gold, but the massive attacks by Native populations left the first Spanish colonial settlers in search of protection. Looking for a defendable position in the early 18th century, the settlers arrived at the current location of Coroico only to be chased into a cave by one of Mount Uchumachi's powerful lightning storms. The cave still exists below the church on the main plaza of Coroico. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Coroico survived a couple of Indians attacks - the biggest one was at the time of the Bolivian War of Independence. 5000 Aymaras attacked the town, which in those days only had 500 inhabitants. The town stood strong, forcing the Aymaras into retreat. Since then, Coroicans celebrate the Fiesta of the Virgin on October 20. Coroico became the capital of the North-Yungas in 1899 making Coroico the political and industrial center of the region, which produces wood products, fruits, and coca for the La Paz region of Bolivia. In 1958, the city was made the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Coroico, and elevated to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Coroico in 1983. An Afro-Bolivian woman dressed in traditional Andean clothing in Coroico From the mid-18th century the lands in this region came under the control of a few powerful families, the hacienderos. These families maintained control of this region until the mid-1950s, when they were overthrown by revolution. After the revolution, agrarian reforms were put in place, dividing the lands up between the national government and the locals. Now, Coroico has a mostly Aymara and Mestizo population. The town has become a major market for the surrounding region. Staple products arrive from La Paz and the surrounding areas to be sold in the colorful markets and stores all days of the week. The region around Coroico has remained a traditional coca growing area and is the smallest of three areas of coca production in Bolivia. New highway: On a part of the road from La Paz to Coroico a new highway has been opened at the end of 2006, and the old Yungas Road is now used mainly for bikers. This Yungas Road is also called the \\"death road\\". The municipality of Coroico also hosts the Unidad Acad√©mica Campesina-Carmen Pampa (UAC-Carmen Pampa), a satellite campus of the Catholic University of Bolivia.

The headquarters are in Frome Road, Adelaide, and it has many patient collection centres and numerous laboratories located throughout South Australia. The Hanson Centre for Cancer Research was established in 1991 by SA Pathology, broadening its scope of research and becoming the Hanson Institute in 2001. As a not-for-profit organisation, SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) pathology tests. In a recent article by Choice magazine, it was recognised as the only consistently \\"no gap, bulk billing\\" pathology provider in South Australia. History The organisation was established as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) in the late 1930s. The Institute began as an offshoot of the Royal Adelaide Hospital laboratories, being located in Frome Road nearby, in what used to be South Australia's principal teaching hospital precinct. RAH Superintendent and Dean of Medicine Sir Trent Champion de Crespigny created an combined laboratory services with clinical pathology training and medical research in one facility. Dr. E. Weston Hurst was appointed its first director in 1937, leaving the role in 1943. In the 1970s, the Forensic Pathology and Biology divisions relocated, eventually becoming Forensic Science SA.Forensic Science SA home page There was growth and diversification in the 1980s, as the relationships with the RAH and the University of Adelaide were strengthened. Following a review recommending the creation of separate science research laboratories, with new developments being integrated into IMVS and RAH, the Hanson Institute was established in the early 1990s. In 2008 IMVS merged with the pathology department of the Women's and Children's Hospital and Flinders Medical Centre's South Path, with the resulting organisation being renamed SA Pathology. Also in that year, the Centre for Cancer Biology (CCB) was established within SA Pathology. Activities Profits generated from pathology are used to support rural communities, medical training and medical research. SA Pathology has medical researchers studying diseases and disorders ranging from blood, breast and colon cancer, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hepatitis, infectious diseases and genetic disorders.

It can be contrasted to fingerstyle guitar, which is playing with individual fingers, with or without wearing fingerpicks. While the use of a plectrum is common in many musical traditions, the exact term \\"flatpicking\\" is most commonly associated with Appalachian music of the American southeastern highlands, especially bluegrass music, where string bands often feature musicians playing a variety of styles, both fingerpicking and flatpicking. Musicians who use a flat pick in other genres such as rock and jazz are not commonly described as flatpickers or even plectrum guitarists. As the use of a pick in those traditions is commonplace, generally only guitarists who play without a pick are noted by the term \\"fingerpicking\\" or \\"fingerstyle\\". Probably starting around 1930, flatpicking in American music was developed when guitarists began arranging old-time American fiddle tunes on the guitar, expanding the instrument's traditional role of rhythm guitar accompaniment with an occasional run on the bass strings. Although early guitarists such as Riley Puckett used a thumb pick to emphasize bass notes, this part of the style was adapted into flatpicking. The melodic style in bluegrass is often fast and dynamic, with slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, powerful strumming and rapid crosspicking. Bluegrass flatpickers usually prefer guitars with a flat top rather than an arch top, and steel strings rather than nylon. Early styles The chief exponents of the early country and bluegrass flatpicking styles included George Shuffler, Alton Delmore, Johnny Bond, Don Reno, and Bill Napier. The lead guitar was sparsely used, and sometimes was considered a novelty. Other instruments may also be used in flatpicking, such as the mandolin. However, banjo styles such as plectrum banjo and tunes played on tenor banjos can be played either by strumming or with a plectrum but they are not commonly known as flatpicking. This style can be typified by players such as Eddie Peabody, and has connections to ragtime and Dixieland music. 1960s The foundation of Puckett, Reno and others were built upon heavily in the 1960s by Doc Watson and Clarence White. Watson and White both legitimized the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass and old-time country music. White brought guitar flatpicking to the forefront of bluegrass, while Watson brought flatpicking to folk audiences as he played fiddle tunes, blues, country, and gospel songs throughout America. 1970s‚Äì1980s Building on the contributions of Doc Watson and Clarence White, artists such as Norman Blake, Dan Crary, John Carlini, Mark O'Connor, Russ Barenberg, Larry Sparks, Fran√ßois Vola and Tony Rice further developed the art of flatpicking. Rice likely had the most profound impact on bluegrass guitar playing of anyone since his musical hero, Clarence White. Rice's tone, rhythm, phrasing, and improvisational skills have influenced an entire generation of bluegrass guitarists. Important elements Rice has used in his playing are jazz type chord substitutions, different from the straight major and minor chords common to bluegrass, and the use of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic \\"blues\\" scale in his lead playing. While there have been several songs using the Dorian mode in Appalachian roots music, Rice made a different statement by using this scale to improvise during songs written in a major key. For instance, he is very well known for playing an F major scale during a song written in G major (the F major scale, when played from G to G, is a G Dorian mode). The use of this technique introduces the flat 3rd (Bb) and the flat 7th (F) over the G chord which has a unique sound popular in bluegrass. 1990s‚Äì2000s In recent years, players such as David Grier, Bryan Sutton, Beppe Gambetta and Tim Stafford have carried the guitar into the next millennium. Also, current \\"young guns\\" like Cody Kilby, John Chapman, Chris Eldridge, Andy Falco, Sean Watkins, Billy \\"Strings\\" Apostol and Jordan Tice continue to explore this style of guitar playing. These players are still defining new standards and reaching wider audiences. Pioneers Rice, Blake, Barenberg, and Crary continue to produce music featuring flatpicking as well.

Geographically, it is located about west of P√©ronne, between the towns of Saint Quentin and Amiens, in the heart of the Battle of the Somme territory. Overview When built, it was criticised by the press for being too far from any of the neighbouring towns to be useful. It was located near a trunk road rather than a connecting railway line: it was often nicknamed la gare des betteraves, or 'sugar beet station', as it is surrounded by sugar beet fields, as it was the case for some rail stations in the countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century, when those vegetables were still transported by train towards the next sugar refinery. Today, the station is connected with the two local main cities, namely Amiens to the west and Saint Quentin to the east, by the A29 motorway ‚Äì it takes around 30 minutes to reach either city and a bus shuttle service operates. The annual number of passengers varies from 360,000 to 400,000. As a very small TGV station, from the point of view of watching the trains the platform is only a few metres from the main running lines, where trains pass by at , and there is a good view of the lines in both directions. At most stations on high-speed lines there is some form of barrier preventing this close up viewing from the platform. Since 2013, passengers are not allowed onto the platforms until the arrival of the next stopping train, in order to avoid any risk of being hit by flying track ballast. There is a business park close to the station.

Plot summary Master criminal Louis Peyton spends each August totally isolated on his Colorado ranch behind a powerful force-field. One August, Albert Cornwell takes him to the Moon to retrieve a cache of extremely valuable \\"singing bells\\" (lunar rocks which, when struck by the correct stroker, make an incredibly beautiful sound) which Cornwall had obtained by killing their discoverer. Peyton kills Cornwell and hides the bells. The police contact Wendell Urth to help them prove that Peyton had been on the Moon, so they can psycho-probe him to get sufficient evidence for a conviction. However, since a person can only be psycho-probed once-in-a- lifetime, the police want to be certain that Peyton is guilty. Urth gives Peyton his own flawed, yet still valuable singing bell to examine. He then has Peyton throw it back to him. The toss falls short and the bell is destroyed when it crashes to the floor.
